1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh! Message for you, son! Attention! Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,620
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,620
Just kidding.

4
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,620
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,620
In this episode...

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,620
Hey, are there any boys down there?

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,620
That's the biggest girl you've ever seen, Jingle Berry.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,620
What's your favorite scary movie?

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,620
Showgirls.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,620
Absolute frightful.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,620
What's yours?

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:54,820
There are no stupid questions.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Just stupid people.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Don't torture yourself.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,820
That's my job.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Now's the time on Scrockets, baby dogs!

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
I don't come through.

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
Why did they have to take the word gay?

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,820
No! What I expect for punishing positions is gentle.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Hey!

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,820
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex and wait.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Orange Lounge Radio.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
I find it funny.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,820
We are live, and this is episode number 22 for December the 1st of 2002.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,820
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most hideous, no just kidding, most unhideous radio station of all things Bimani.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,620
Joining me as always is my awesome co-host in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,980
farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
You know her better.

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
It's Darksekara.

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
I have nuts.

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Yes, you have some nice...

37
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,340
They're tasty, unsalted nuts.

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,880
They're lovely and unsalted.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,580
They're a true joy to lick.

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
Fashions are good for you.

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
We appreciate that.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,580
They're high in protein.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
They're a fiber.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,100
And in that corner, say hello to the one and only Tech Massa.

45
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
It's Loki.

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
Hey, everybody.

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Hey, how you doing?

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm doing good.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Very good.

50
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Very good.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
All right.

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
I'm gonna eat my nuts.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,740
Okay, I have had a cry for you, Dark Sakura.

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:38,980
Also tonight with us in studio, say hello to Brad, Nike-style, and the happy little

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,980
Panda Rice Princess.

56
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Say hello to Irene.

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Hi, I'm with the Panda Rice Princess, too.

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Addicts.

59
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,180
You're all addicts.

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,180
We'll be talking to them more.

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,220
We're going to do a list list tonight, so they'll be back for a list list a little later

62
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,380
in the show. First we're going to take a really quick break, feature you some requests, and

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,460
we're going to eat more nuts, and we'll be right back to talk about all things Bahmani,

64
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
and then some. See you then!

65
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,460
See you then!

66
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Don't turn off the lights

67
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,560
Be-be-be be good

68
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:14,460
I'll be there, I'll be there I'll be there, I'll be there

69
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,460
We will die if you love me

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,460
We'll take a party on your table

71
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,460
And we'll never know when to say

72
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,460
You love me, kiss me

73
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
We'll bring hair and say

74
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm so free now

75
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:48,180
Why bother every night to get the shot?

76
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,660
All you're leaving is what you want

77
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:01,780
Every night I'll be here tonight

78
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:09,140
Maybe this year won't come soon enough

79
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:18,140
They took the credit for your second symphony We're written by machine and you take the last G

80
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:29,140
And now I understand the problems you can see I met your children What did you tell them?

81
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Video killed the radio star, video killed the radio star

82
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,140
The tears came and broke your heart

83
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,140
And now we meet in an abandoned studio

84
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,140
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

85
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,140
And you remember the jingles used to go

86
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Oh oh, you were the first one

87
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,140
Oh oh, you were the last one

88
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Video killed the radio star

89
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,140
Video killed the radio star

90
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,140
In my mind and in my car

91
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,140
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

92
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
Oh

93
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Oh

94
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
Oh

95
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up.

96
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,140
It's on Orange Lounge Radio.

97
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,140
Hello, we are back live.

98
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

99
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
Dave's in the house.

100
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
What's up?

101
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
He's color-coordinated.

102
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
What's up?

103
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Yeah, I wear blue now.

104
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
That's all I wear.

105
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
You're so coordinated today.

106
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,140
A happy Hanukkah to you, Dave.

107
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Yeah, I got Max USA.

108
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Woot woot!

109
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
Woot woot!

110
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Dave, by the way, is also our resident Jew.

111
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
Congratulations.

112
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,140
No, you gotta love the Jewish people, though.

113
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,780
I've never met a mean Jewish person.

114
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Every Jewish person I've ever met has been completely nice.

115
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,580
Dave kind of borderline, but you know, good enough.

116
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
My grandmother.

117
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,620
No, I do like this color coordination thing you have going though, very nice.

118
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,660
You know, you're just playing that promo, the catch-up song promo, and I was thinking

119
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,180
Dave's the only person I know that actually knows the dance.

120
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,420
And I wish I'd known the other night when they were playing it at the club.

121
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
I don't know the dance.

122
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,880
I saw the five second video of them doing like the I don't know the chimichanga dance or whatever. It's called

123
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,260
Yeah, that's where you lay on your back and wave your hands in the feet and you're like a dead cockroach

124
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,000
But the reason why I'm late is because are we just being totally random tonight, why are you tardy sir?

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,940
Well, I figured you're just getting used to the 630 thing. This is only like what the third show

126
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,980
we've been starting 6-3? Actually, I remember at about 4 o'clock, I'm like, okay, well,

127
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,900
I just borrowed Kingdom Hearts from my friend JJ, so I think I'll go play the Hades Cup

128
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,740
now, which is 50 battles long, including at least five bosses. So I started that, I'm

129
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,820
not exactly sure when, because I had to level up a little bit, and then I finally finished,

130
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:05,500
I beat everyone, and I finished like ten minutes ago, and then I ran down and came over here.

131
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Well, I suppose if we're going to get cast aside for Kingdom Hearts, there's not a lot we can do.

132
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Animal Crossing stole me from Kingdom Hearts.

133
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
That's right. Animal Crossing, by the way, is in the other room right now, and that's where Brad and Irene...

134
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
They just came in in the beginning to say hello, and now they're back out there. They'll be back for Listless later on the show, but...

135
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm going to have to start playing Kingdom Hearts again, because I'm only in Agrabah.

136
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm way over-leveled for where I am.

137
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Being suggested in the chat room, apparently EOSFBB has this bookmarked, the link to the catch-up song video.

138
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Because he sure was able to find that pretty fast.

139
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
So, he wants us to watch that live on air, but unfortunately, I can't do that.

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I don't want to vomit on the microphone.

141
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Yeah, we don't want to get Jamie to vomit on the microphone.

142
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Also, if I try to watch streaming video, it eats up a lot of my resources,

143
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
which means listeners get kicked from the live stream, and we don't want that to happen.

144
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
But, we'll do that another time.

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,500
He says he wants to thank whoever made that video, so I'm assuming there's a lot of cleavage in the boob shots.

146
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Cleavage-ay.

147
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Anyway.

148
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah, let's hear it for tits.

149
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

150
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
As I say it, I'm a flat monotone.

151
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Okay, we apologize also if you're hearing a hum in the background tonight.

152
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
We don't know what's causing it.

153
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:25,500
We're trying in studio here to take measures to not have it happen, but it's still happening we think, so just bear with us tonight please.

154
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Yes, just pretend we're all doing yoga.

155
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,500
It's the incessant noise of Homer after he's like, mmm, doughnut.

156
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Beer, 72 ounce tub of beer.

157
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
You know they sell these huge, huge, big old things at 7-Eleven now.

158
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
It's like, gotta be like a hundred and thirteen ounces.

159
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
The bucket.

160
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
The bucket.

161
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
The super bucket.

162
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
You didn't see the bucket that I bought, Dan, at Great America.

163
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What's that?

164
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
We were there to see Margaret Cho.

165
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I bought this 100 and something ounce bucket, drink bucket for Dan.

166
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh, I do remember seeing that. Yes, it was for his coffee.

167
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Mm-hmm. No, just for him to drink.

168
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Well, just for him to drink. For orange soda.

169
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You know, the 7-Eleven's having a special right now. You can fill up any mug for 79 cents full of coffee.

170
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Dude, I'll do that. I'll bring that thing and fill it up full of coffee and take it to work.

171
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
You should make your ghetto mochas.

172
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Dude, my ghetto mochas own.

173
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:30,980
The Get-A-Mocha, you take really strong coffee, and then you put in Swiss Miss chocolate mix.

174
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:38,820
Add in a tablespoon of hazelnut creamer, and then like half a spoonful of sugar.

175
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,980
Mix that up, add more coffee to mix everything else up, and then drink it.

176
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,980
You'll be awake all day for the next week.

177
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,820
Oh, you're going to go get sucked in Animal Crossing 2 as well.

178
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,820
I've heard so much about it, how can I resist?

179
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Fine, fine.

180
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,820
You didn't even eat my nuts.

181
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,020
Oh, now Bradley's here.

182
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,820
Dang, is there a party going on at the house today that I don't know about apparently?

183
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
There's a party at the house and everyone's invited.

184
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Alright, let's say hello to Bradley.

185
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
How you doing Bradley?

186
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
I'm doing okay.

187
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,420
You just ran over here, you were in the chat room in the exit and now here you are.

188
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,820
Now you came to finally get your 2DX controller this week, right?

189
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Yes.

190
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Let's upgrade again.

191
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I'll come back again.

192
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,620
I swear I haven't played it at all.

193
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,780
Well, obviously we have Animal Crossing now, so we got sucked into that, so there's no

194
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,620
use for my Playstation anymore because we've got Animal Crossing.

195
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,700
Scroop Imani, this is now a show all about Animal Crossing.

196
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,420
Oh my god, that Mallory.

197
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,700
It's the I hate Mallory show.

198
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,340
I like Mallory.

199
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Just kidding, just kidding.

200
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Mallory gives me stuff.

201
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,900
Well, you hear that Olivia is the troublemaker in our town, who moved from your town.

202
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,540
I don't want Olivia back.

203
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
You're abusing Olivia.

204
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,060
I do have to say also though, of course, a big, big thank you to Loki, because Loki spent

205
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,780
some bonus money on spreading a little joy in the household of Rob this week.

206
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:05,140
Yeah, he created a, I don't know, a whole troupe of zombies playing that game.

207
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah, Zombie would be right, because Neil was up at about three last morning still playing

208
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,940
it, yesterday morning still playing it.

209
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,940
the

210
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,200
let's start the show off tonight by visiting the old mail bag if you want to

211
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,460
send us an email i gotta do is email orange lounge radio at yahoo dot com

212
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,700
and so right now we're gonna open up the mail bag and take a look

213
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,280
because we've got some mail this week we

214
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,880
Let's see, going into the mail bag, orangelaunchradio.yahoo.com.

215
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,200
Oh, look, one new message.

216
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,280
Hey, that's one more email that we had last week.

217
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,120
Yes, and I feel so special.

218
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,440
All right.

219
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,040
We have an email from, let me see if there's a handle here.

220
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,640
No, there isn't.

221
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,560
So we have an email from Martin.

222
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,240
And Martin emailed us, and he has some questions.

223
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,920
There's a few questions he'd like to ask us here in the studio.

224
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,280
So I thought we'd go down and we'd answer his questions,

225
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
because we're nice, we're open people here on Orange Lounge Radio.

226
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
We'll each give it an answer.

227
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
We'll each give these questions an answer, and it's a good time filler.

228
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
So, question number one from Martin's email.

229
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
He wants to know...

230
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,280
I would assume this is specifically for Jamie.

231
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
What are you on?

232
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Happy Crack.

233
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Also known as Propel.

234
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Propel? You're on Propel.

235
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Loki, what are you on?

236
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
I'm not on anything.

237
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
I just like this.

238
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm high on life.

240
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm on God. No, I'm just kidding.

241
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay, not that there's anything wrong with that.

242
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,280
If all goes well later, I'll be on a stranger's bed.

243
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,280
No, uh, just kidding, just kidding.

244
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Two, uh, question number two.

245
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Question 2 for Martin. Can he have some?

246
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Sure, go to Walgreens.

247
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Go to Walgreens and get some Propel.

248
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:25,280
As we discussed, I'm not on anything, so to have...no. You can't.

249
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
You can't have any of me. I'm too good for you.

250
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,320
And unfortunately you can't have any of my life. You can probably get some man porn if

251
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
you go down to your local video store.

252
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,960
Rob, are you running out of time? Do you need a time transplant?

253
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes. I need to go back to high school. I missed out on so much.

254
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay, you know what? Martin, if you send us your address, we will send you some Orange

255
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,480
Propel, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio. How's that sound?

256
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Okay.

257
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,880
Alright, we'll send some Orange Propel so he can have some of what Jamie's on.

258
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
But I usually drink the berry flavor.

259
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
The orange flavor sort of tastes like a weak tang.

260
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Ho ho ho.

261
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You are!

262
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Yeah, give us your address and we'll send you flavored water.

263
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,880
up

264
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,280
the

265
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,520
nation

266
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,120
your disgusting

267
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,360
alright question number three why does the chat room not work on my fucking

268
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,000
computer

269
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,320
this year

270
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,940
Let me guess, you're using a Mac.

271
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,580
Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing. You must be using a Mac.

272
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,100
I know it's a little difficult, and you might get it confused with a toaster.

273
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,780
Now, here's how you can tell.

274
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,940
Can you put toast in it?

275
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,140
Does it make bagels?

276
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,980
If it does those two things,

277
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,500
that's kind of difficult. You might need to, you know, actually get a computer expert to determine whether it's a toaster or a Mac, so...

278
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Good luck there. I only said that to piss off BlackWap, because I know he's listening right now.

279
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
We love you, BlackWap!

280
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:26,500
BlackWap, by the way, is a big Mac fan, so we occasionally knock on the Macs to piss him off.

281
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
And if SharksGirl's listening, she's a Mac whore, too. She's a Macette.

282
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
We like her Mac, because her Mac is shiny.

283
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
And special reverse CDs for her.

284
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,460
That's true.

285
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,820
The best thing I can suggest is use the Java chat room.

286
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,420
All you have to do is you go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and then you're going

287
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,020
to just click on the chat page and then at the very bottom it will say, if all these

288
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,060
steps don't work, try our Java applet.

289
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,260
And I have to give thanks to Twen because he helped us get this Java applet working,

290
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,460
this handy little thing.

291
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
And that should work.

292
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,460
computer can view complex websites, you can run Java, you can get in the chat through

293
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,580
that method. So good luck, and we hope to see you in the chat room tonight.

294
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,420
Question number four from Martin, we're going through the email in our email bag at orangelionsradio.yahoo.com

295
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,660
right now. Question number four is, how the hell did you know so much about the money?

296
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,540
Well. Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is

297
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,540
the part where we get to inflate our egos a little bit talking about how old school

298
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,820
we are, Jamie. Gee, don't start on me or anything.

299
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Do you want to go new school-ist to old school-ist?

300
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Well, I can start.

301
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Alright, Jamie's the most old school in the room.

302
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
Alright, let's see.

303
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Not last year, year before.

304
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Because I first played on the DDR machine at AX 2000, I think it was.

305
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Okay.

306
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
Bradley was there, that's where I met Bradley.

307
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
On the AX 2000?

308
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Yeah, I started playing in February of that year.

309
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,820
Actually, I had seen DDR the year before that.

310
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:07,820
I was in a best-to-move tournament, best-to-move 2, just trashing everybody until I got a faulty controller.

311
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,820
So it was in July of 1999 that I first saw DDR and I looked over and I was like,

312
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:23,820
that game looks stupid, until I heard someone playing Kung Fu Fighting.

313
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,820
And I was like, hey, it's Kung Fu Fighting, that's pretty cool.

314
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,820
I went over and looked at it like, oh, and then I played DDR for the first time in February, and my friend loaned me his Playstation version and the dance pad.

315
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm really crappy, you're a funny one too, but I digress.

316
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:50,820
So, I was like, this DDR thing is cool, and then I came home from work one day in April, my birthday, and there was our Dreamcast set out with one of the nice dance pads and my own DDR second mix.

317
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,820
So I was happy. I first played the machine in July of 2000 at the Anime Expo.

318
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,820
I paid $2 a game. I slept in the damn room.

319
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Just watching people. I was like, oh man, that's cool.

320
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,820
I remember being in there and seeing Xanadu because I liked the movie.

321
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
And I liked Olivia Newton-John.

322
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,820
And people were going, I thought you never played DDR before.

323
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
But I like, this was a movie? Hello?

324
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Olivia Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra? Are you that young?

325
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,820
So, and that's how it went from there, September-ish, no, maybe August or so.

326
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Kojiko Lanes got their DDR 1.5 and that started it.

327
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Right on. So, and just you've become such an addict over time that that's how you know.

328
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
So much about money.

329
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Yeah, I just kept finding more and more stuff that I like.

330
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
Sounds good. My story, I'll try to keep it brief.

331
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Well, there's one other thing.

332
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
Oh, yeah, sorry.

333
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I have this, you know, addiction to owning controllers.

334
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,820
So, oooh, we need my money again, I have to get a controller for it!

335
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Alright, how the hell did I discover my money?

336
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,820
It was over Memorial Day in 2000, I think?

337
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Couple years ago, it was a couple years ago.

338
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
Actually, maybe it was 99, actually, come to think of it.

339
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,820
I don't remember, but it was Memorial Day some year, I went and I actually went to Milpitas Golf Land.

340
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
And I think they were having a tournament because there were a lot of people there.

341
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,600
lot of people there. Now keep in mind I knew nothing about, we were actually going there

342
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,920
to golf. I knew nothing about DDR or anything. I saw the game, thought it was cool. No chance

343
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,920
in hell I was going to be playing because there was way too crowded around the machine.

344
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,340
But I actually ended up seeing the machine months later at a 25th anniversary Rocky Horror

345
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,960
convention in October of 2000 and that's when I played for the first time. And a couple

346
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,520
friends from the Rocky cast, including Rice Princesses out in the other room, we skipped

347
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,360
out on the convention Friday night and we stayed up and played DDR and it was so much

348
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:55,040
fun. So that's when I got hooked on DDR. And after that, let's see, I started playing when

349
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,520
Roswell Golf Land got USA mixed in something like, what, January? I don't know. So I started

350
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,360
playing, no it was December, December of two years ago. I met you at Milpitas Golf Land.

351
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,680
Yeah, so it's coming up, yeah it's coming up two years. So two years I've been playing

352
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,140
I'm a sponge, I pick up every piece of information I hear.

353
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,320
As far as the radio thing goes, I used to have my own college radio show for seven semesters

354
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,680
back when I went to Chico State, so that's kind of where I picked up the radio thing.

355
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,100
And then I was co-hosting a program called Understation Live up until a couple months

356
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,780
ago when our head host Travis had to leave, took off for Texas and just kind of been doing

357
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,500
the radio thing ever since. Orange Lounge is, I guess at its core, Orange Lounge is

358
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,500
somewhat of a spin-off of that show, but I don't know. I don't know what you want to

359
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
call it.

360
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,300
Lowkey, your turn. You're the most new school, and this is kind of sad, because I know you've

361
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,020
been playing DDR at least a year, so that doesn't make you that new school.

362
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,340
It's actually been like two years.

363
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Oh, wow.

364
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:05,340
I started, I think it was, I'd say, maybe April of 2001? Yeah, April of 2001, so it's almost been two years.

365
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:16,340
And I started, I saw it first at Phantom of a Con that year, 2001, saw it there, and I actually got to try it out on...

366
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,340
I saw you there. I knew I saw you at Pawnee. I was dressed up as Emmy.

367
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,340
How would I remember it? I don't know.

368
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,340
He was drunk.

369
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
He was trying to get hookers.

370
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
I wasn't trying to get hookers.

371
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Well, if you tuned into last week or the week before that, you would have already known that that's happened.

372
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
I mean, sort of.

373
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
No, he was chasing the Jiggly Slut around.

374
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
The Jiggly Slut.

375
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
The Jiggly Puff Cosplay Girl.

376
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
No, they...

377
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
No, I remember...

378
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Well, no, that one.

379
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Last year.

380
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Last year we were chasing around a bunch of women with cameras, but no.

381
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:01,340
Anyways, so I saw a DDR fourth mix there, and then I got to try a USA machine in Tahoe and had no rhythm whatsoever, so that was fun.

382
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:13,340
And so then I went and I guess I found out that it was at Sunsplash or RVGL, and so I went and played down there ever since the other fourth in their USA machine.

383
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,340
I bought the home versions and that kind of thing.

384
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:26,340
And then ever since that, because I used to be really into QZAR, and you know, the laser tech place up here, and I played it for like four years, I was really obsessed with it, well then that went away.

385
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:43,340
And so now, now I guess I'm just, you know, into DDR, and how I know a lot of stuff about Bimani is that at my work, during phone calls and stuff, I'm actually browsing the Bimani news sites out there, and you know, that's how I know pretty much everything goes on.

386
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,740
So I read about 12 different message boards all day long.

387
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,340
Right on.

388
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
So that's the answer to that question.

389
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,180
Boy, that was a long answer.

390
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,660
But hey, we've got a lot to say here on Orange Lounge Radio.

391
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,460
If you're just joining us, as I know some people have just

392
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,020
joined us, we are answering email right now.

393
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,300
If you have a question, a comment,

394
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,140
something you'd like to say, we will read it

395
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,060
in our mailbag segment.

396
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,980
Just send us an email, OrangeLoungeRadio,

397
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,940
all one word, at yahoo.com.

398
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,940
and we're reading an email from Martin right now, and he asked a bunch of questions, so we're answering them right now.

399
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,940
Question number five, is it only me, or do the Zippers suck?

400
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,940
The Zippers, by the way, being that band that JB brought in last night, or, I'm sorry, last week with the CD.

401
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm not a huge fan of the Zippers. In fact, I don't like them pretty much at all.

402
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,940
But, yeah, they kind of suck if you don't like that speed type music thing.

403
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't know, that's kind of a trend that DDR has, you know, putting a lot of speed mixes and Euromix and stuff, so if you're just not into it, I guess that you wouldn't like it, but you know, it's something for someone, I'm sure.

404
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,940
How come everyone I know suddenly has the weasel, aka Bush Baby?

405
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Bush Baby, our second Orange Lounge mascot, our first Orange Lounge mascot would be Dave.

406
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,940
But our second Orange Lounge mascot would be the weasel.

407
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,940
It was given to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.

408
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,940
Simple as that, and it sits here. I have a lot of little thingies that sit above the computer.

409
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,940
There's a Clifford ball, there's a devil I got from that same convention where I saw DDR the first time,

410
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,660
Batsmaru, a bunch of stickers, the cartman doll, things like that, and the ferret was

411
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,900
just sitting up there and Jamie grabbed it one night and just went to town, so you hear

412
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,540
it right now.

413
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,060
So that's the story behind the weasel, and if everyone you know has the weasel, I don't

414
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,980
know your friends, so I don't know why.

415
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,980
It's a ferret, it's a weasel or a ferret, it's a thingy.

416
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,020
Next question, how did you find out about DER top hits or mis-hits?

417
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,580
I signed on to Sac Bay Monty one day and there it was, the end.

418
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,060
low-key told me so i have told

419
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,720

the money knock-offs it's been off that i think and i haven't been the person

422
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,980
they're talking about the air topics

423
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,660
uh... same group did another one uh... it is so a lot of great

424
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,420
to fit

425
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,780
the same people that did that one

426
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,460
so uh... yeah aaron in japan dot com very fine website we like them so

427
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,000
visit them.

428
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Next question.

429
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,160
Did I get your email address right?

430
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,100
Well, of course you did because we're reading your email right now.

431
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,380
It is OrangeLoungeRadial, all in a word, at yahoo.com and says, Loki, email me back if

432
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
you did.

433
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,900
So I'll forward this email to Loki and you two can talk about whatever you guys need

434
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
to talk about.

435
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I don't know.

436
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh, maybe he wants a date.

437
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,260
Oh, no, I don't.

438
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
We'll see.

439
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
All right.

440
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,300
So thanks so much for the email, Marvin.

441
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,300
We appreciate it.

442
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,740
And I think he just joined the chat room.

443
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,740
I see a new name here that matches the one on the email, so who knows?

444
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Oh, we just got one more new message. Let's have a look.

445
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Oh, we got an email from Black Lab. Oh, it says FUs of the Week. Well, we've got to save those for later.

446
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Never mind. We'll read those later. Those are the FUs of the Week.

447
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,740
Okay. Oh, I'd like to say an early happy birthday to DDR Angel.

448
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,740
That's somebody new that just started chatting in our chat room this week, and she's having a birthday on Wednesday.

449
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,340
And she would love it if you came out to Scandia in Rohnert Park and played some DDR with her

450
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
for her birthday.

451
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,460
I was going to try to make it out there, but I don't know how flexible it is with my work.

452
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,780
Yeah, it's a little ways to go.

453
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Yeah.

454
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,620
Oh, he says, he says yes, it is him.

455
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,420
And also, another early happy birthday wish to one of our, we have a new school listener

456
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,820
and a very, very old school listener, been here with us, I believe, since the first show,

457
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,980
did our website, SoCalKicks is having a birthday tomorrow.

458
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Woohoo!

459
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Happy birthday to him.

460
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Squeeze.

461
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,980
Oh, I can turn off the music now. We're done with the mailbag.

462
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,980
So a big happy birthday yet, because I have the sound off in the studio to try to get rid of that, huh?

463
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,980
I don't know. We'll see.

464
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,980
So, speaking of

465
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,980
SoCal Kicks, I believe I can talk about this now, yeah? I don't know.

466
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,980
We're going to see. I'm going to plug some websites. We're going to do some website hunting

467
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,980
right now, because a couple websites have just launched.

468
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
There's one right now!

469
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Dude, that game looks so boring. I don't know if there's some underlying secret mind control device, but it's like, okay.

470
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,980
Yes. You talking about Animal Crossing? Yes. It's addicting as hell.

471
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,980
It's like, okay, I need to go change the music now.

472
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Did they show you the old-school Nintendo games that you can play? Tell them to go to my house and play the old-school Nintendo games. It's awesome.

473
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,980
Okay, I will.

474
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Do you want to comment on Animal Crossing?

475
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
No, I was saying yes.

476
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
Oh, okay.

477
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Oh yes, back to SoCalKicks.com.

478
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Blah, blah, blah. Welcome back to SDK Max Ultimate Evolution just now.

479
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,980
About time after a three week wait, and constant launch dates being flushed right down the drain.

480
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Finally the site relaunches, just in time for SoCalKicks' birthday.

481
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Happy birthday.

482
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,980
He's got a lot of people on board, gonna be doing the website stuff, and none of us are on it.

483
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:12,500
Oh, but he says it is in no way the final staff list, so maybe we can, you know, turn

484
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,300
some tricks and get listed.

485
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,720
He wants more people on his staff.

486
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,820
He wants more people to get on his staff.

487
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,740
Let's see, so what's so big about SDK Max 5.0 that makes it better than the other versions?

488
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,740
says

489
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
Did Jamie leave?

490
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
She left.

491
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,740
Oh, my bad.

492
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,580
Okay, we'll take a really quick break, and then after this break, we're going to peruse

493
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,060
another website that we've been asked to whore out tonight.

494
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,360
So we will be right back after this very quick break.

495
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,200
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll be right back to talk about all

496
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,200
things but money. And then some. See ya!

497
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
We're gonna fight for life

498
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Baby fight to the right

499
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
We're gonna move tonight

500
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Let's move tonight

501
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Yeah we'll fight to the right

502
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Baby fight to the right

503
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
We're gonna move tonight

504
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Let's just go Alright

505
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Let's just go Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

506
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Let's just go Have a good time

507
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,520
All right, all right, all right

508
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,280
Let them go, they should stand up

509
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,640
All right, all right

510
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,920
One, two, three, two, one

511
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:42,520
Hello, you are

512
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,860
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and that was three to one stars which is going to be

513
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,860
in DDR Extreme.

514
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,860
It's delicious.

515
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,040
It's extremely an old Bimani song but it'll be in DDR Extreme and I always said that should

516
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,980
be in DDR because it's fun.

517
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,340
Before that, by request, Let's Groove coming to us from the chat room and if you want to

518
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:06,620
join our chat room just go to our website orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.

519
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,400
It's just that simple.

520
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,580
Another quick announcement, I don't think we announced this last break, I want to state

521
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,080
for all you guys. Next week's show, next Sunday's show, I'm actually not going to be here, so

522
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,640
what we're going to do is we're going to tape the show on Saturday night. It's still going

523
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,120
to be in the house, so if you want to tune in at 6.30 next Saturday, you'll hear the

524
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,400
show live. But for those of you that can't make it on Saturday night, we'll rebroadcast

525
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,400
at the normal time on Sunday. Yes, I'm going to see, I'm going to the Cher concert. See

526
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,400
See what I'm really wanting to go see, though? Cindy Lauper's opening, and she's just fucking fabulous, so I can't wait to go.

527
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:53,400
So, um, we will be taped next week. But if you want to hear it live, we'll be doing the normal shtick just on Saturday night as opposed to Sunday.

528
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,400
So, outside of that, um, oh yes, we're going to be also doing a mini-marathon next week.

529
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,400
So if you want to catch up on some old episodes of Orange Islands Radio, we're going to be marathoning all of season one next weekend.

530
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
All of it. So, tune in for that.

531
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Actually, this is something that you and I have discussed, and I forgot to mention it before the show.

532
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Yes, that's fine.

533
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I talked to you before about a friend of mine who's doing a radio drama.

534
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Yes! Talk about this. Talk about this.

535
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
It's called Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

536
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,400
One is actually based on I Feel Sick, which was Debbie's spin-off.

537
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,400
And I'm going to be a voice actor in it. I'm going to be oblivia.

538
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:43,400
And we still need one more voice actor for this. My friend Michelle is very talented, doing a very good adaptation of the comic.

539
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:51,400
So we need one more voice actor, so if anyone's interested, send an email to orangelounge.com.

540
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I'm interested.

541
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Can you sound like a whiny gothic boy?

542
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
I can sound whiny. Wait, I sound whiny as it is.

543
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Well, hey, we'll see. You just get me some samples ready.

544
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,400
So it'll be part of that Bamani music and then some. You're going to be hearing some and then some coming to Orange Lawn's radio.

545
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Right, once everything's done, the plan is to air it, you know, during the show.

546
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I want to be Sque when, you know, he gets his appearance.

547
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
We'll talk to her about it.

548
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,480
But we're definitely going to be, once everything is, you know, we've got a first episode reported,

549
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,200
it's going to be played right here.

550
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,560
Right on.

551
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,280
So just stay tuned for that.

552
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,720
Keep tabs on our website, we'll always be talking about that.

553
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Speaking of websites, we were taking the website tour just before we went to break.

554
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,360
We visited SoCalKicks.com and now we're going to whore out another website.

555
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,880
Brand new, I'm not sure if this is going to be a blog or what it is, I believe it's a

556
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,320
blog but I'm being asked to whore it out by a chat regular of ours, DCB.

557
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
He's a good buddy of the show.

558
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,520
He's going to be doing a tournament in Fremont, a DDR tourney in Fremont in January.

559
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,280
Check the DDR Freak Tournament forums if you want more information on that.

560
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,840
A Fremont tournament in January.

561
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,000
And he's got this website called Killer Pals, which I'm not sure if that's a reference,

562
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,840
that sounds like a reference to something in the 80s, I just don't remember what.

563
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,440
Like wasn't there some Saturday morning show where the club was a killer, the Super Friends?

564
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,400
Am I just getting Super Friends confused with Killer Pals?

565
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I don't know.

566
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,400
You may have been Killer Pals or Tilly Pals, but I don't know.

567
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Yeah, Killer Pals I guess could be the name of a really bad B-movie.

568
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I don't know.

569
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,320
I'm going to post this link for all y'all in the chat room, but if you aren't in our

570
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:42,400
chat room, it's just www.radbeats.com slash tilde killer pals.

571
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
That little squiggly thing.

572
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,840
Tilde, it's a tilde.

573
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,980
It's the shift in the upper left thing, yes.

574
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,980
you should keep an eye on. It's pretty. Because they're neat. I only know about half these

575
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,340
people, but they're all neat. The half I do know are neat. They're very well taken care

576
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,900
of and clean. They have good hygiene. So, visit the killer pals, because Bongo demands

577
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,780
it. Yeah. Let's see, oh, 23rd Magus has a comment for you, Jamie. He says he can sound

578
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:50,780
like a whiny goth boy, because he is.

579
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,460
Do samples of your voice try to sound, you know, do different types of voices and say

580
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,100
different things and email me that.

581
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,260
Meet me later on AIM and I'll get that from you.

582
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:07,100
Now they're having an argument in the chat room about tilde versus tilde.

583
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,340
Squiggly thing.

584
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,860
Squiggly thing, exactly.

585
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,940
Just go to dictionary.com and look up the words.

586
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,780
hail the squiggly thing. And it will have a pronunciation key there, so you don't have

587
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:23,740
to actually go into a dictionary or a real one. Okay, so that's our website tour for

588
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,580
the week. I don't know, is there any other website news that you know of, things going

589
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:36,940
on? Loki, any big websites that have been renovated? Mergers, buyouts, sellouts, downtimes?

590
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,980
Other than like the week, couple week old 2DX style going down, I guess they're doing

591
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:24,980
Okay. But all they really had on that site, the site itself, was just the official, you know, Bomani tracks, so you can find those everywhere anyway, so it's kind of useless. But they really had a cool link section that I kind of missed.

592
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:35,980
Let me make one quick interruption. Michelle, I see you, and yes I did whore out the show. We are going to have that last voice actor.

593
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,980
Okay, cool.

594
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,980
That's all right.

595
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,980
You surrounded us.

596
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
Gonna like be brought to you.

597
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
Oh, ass!

598
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,580
Sorry to interrupt, Loki, but that's what we do.

599
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,580
That's pretty much it.

600
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,300
Not that I'll be renovating my site at some point when I feel like it.

601
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,500
I haven't felt like it, so...yeah.

602
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:00,700
Uh, Leech from Loki TK will soon be hosting some Sky Original StepMania files.

603
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
Yeah.

604
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,600
They will be scary indeed, so keep an eye out for them.

605
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
And I...

606
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,700
I also have to mention that I did change my tourney mix 3 song and you'll be hearing that

607
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,700
later on in the show.

608
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,900
Yes, we'll be doing that in the cage match later.

609
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,900
Cage match is coming up.

610
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,540
I'm so glad we have a crowded chat room tonight.

611
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
That makes me a happy bunny.

612
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,540
Oh, hello Elena!

613
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Oh, yes!

614
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,200
I wanted to get to this.

615
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
You have to go soon, huh?

616
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh, well I wanted to talk to Elena.

617
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,940
Everybody say hello to Elena.

618
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,940
Hello!

619
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,940
Hello!

620
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,180
Now for those that don't know Elena, which would be everybody, well not in this room.

621
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,780
We all know Elena because we saw her before the show started.

622
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,500
Elena is a friend of mine, she's a buddy of mine.

623
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:57,060
You know me before I got into DDR, and I was still a nerd back then, too, right?

624
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,060
Oh yeah, completely.

625
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,700
What I want to talk to you about is, because I like to bring strangers on the show occasionally

626
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,760
that know nothing about DDR, just ask you, what do you think when you see this for the

627
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,320
first time, this DDR Fanatic Fan Club?

628
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,860
Are we crazy, or what is it?

629
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,060
You know what, frankly you scare me.

630
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
Will we scare you?

631
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,060
How do we scare you?

632
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,060
Oh, I don't know.

633
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,200
It's just all the dancing and all the weird things you guys do.

634
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
All the weird things?

635
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Like what?

636
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,200
Handplants and bar raping?

637
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Yeah.

638
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:34,200
I see some of the stuff that you guys, the dance moves and stuff, it's kind of weird.

639
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,840
It's weird in a good way, I should say.

640
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,560
But what I did want to talk to Alaina about is that she just discovered the world of PlayStation

641
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,920
2, what, two weeks ago?

642
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
How did this happen?

643
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Actually, my roommate's boyfriend, Mike, brought over a PlayStation, and this is really a big

644
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,920
It's a big upgrade for us over at my roommates in my house.

645
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
We have the original Atari.

646
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
We have been playing it actually.

647
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
The original.

648
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
We play Space Invaders and all the fun stuff.

649
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
I wanted to ask you about Atari 2600.

650
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,920
You've been playing Atari 2600.

651
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,920
Up until two weeks ago, it was all about fucking Atari.

652
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,920
It was great.

653
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,920
What is the best Atari 2600 game you've ever played in your whole life?

654
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
Space Invaders.

655
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Space Invaders?

656
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
I just love it.

657
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
I disagree.

658
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
I disagree.

659
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Break out.

660
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,080
kaboom kaboom kaboom is the best kangaroo

661
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,840
no i didn't like kangaroo at all but you know what i have a 5200 and it's all

662
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,600
about kicks see we can't even get that game it's all

663
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,960
about a large group of drunk people playing combat no

664
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,520
okay i'm being i'm being yelled at in the chat room because atari 2600 is not

665
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,760
the original atari it's the only atari that matters so

666
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,760
There was the Pong system, and there was some other one that was like a maze one.

667
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
Yeah, but this is...

668
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,760
Yeah, but as far as conventional systems go, the Atari 2600 is probably the granddaddy,

669
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
unless you count the Fairchild Channel left that came out before it.

670
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,760
You don't even play Game Boy?

671
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,760
No, actually, I haven't ever played Game Boy.

672
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
You haven't ever played Game Boy?

673
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,760
Never.

674
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
So, you just don't think you can get into the DDR?

675
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,760
Did you see the turntable game? The 2DX? The turntable game with the buttons?

676
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
No.

677
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,760
No? Is it just intimidating? What frighted you about DDR?

678
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,760
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm a pretty busy person and I just don't know how to play.

679
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Oh! Oh, I see. You don't got no time for DDR. Oh, mm-hmm.

680
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Busy Elena. She got time to be doing the Space Invaders.

681
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,760
But heaven forbid you asked her to dance a little.

682
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Now, Space Invaders is an awfully good drunk party game, so just don't ignore it.

683
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
Well, so is DDR.

684
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Well...

685
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,760
You've been to the house parties, you know.

686
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Yes, I do.

687
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,760
I can play 2DX drunk and do pretty good.

688
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,760
But you know what, it's not only just DDR that is a little Ina Strange.

689
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,760
I can do a party that you were at.

690
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,760
You guys were playing something with...

691
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,760
Yes, Parapara.

692
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,760
Oh, Parapara scares even us, so it's okay.

693
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Oh, we got Ryan to wear Ena's clothing. That was great.

694
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,760
We got one of our friends, Ryan, SDMX, he actually wore his girlfriend's clothes and played Para Para.

695
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Pictures were taken of this and put on other websites, yes.

696
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,760
That was insane. That was an insane part.

697
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Did we get you to play that? How was Para Para frightening to you?

698
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
I wasn't drunk enough.

699
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
How was Para Para frightening? I want to know.

700
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Well, first of all, it's not a fish.

701
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,460
Actually, most of the songs are in English and all the texts in the game is, too.

702
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,840
Not the one that you guys had on that night.

703
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,300
The Macarena's in Spanish?

704
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,380
Everybody knows the Macarena?

705
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,020
Yes, got her.

706
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,660
Well, the scary thing I think about Patapata is that when you watch the people who know

707
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,300
the dances, and then you have five people behind them who all know the dances, too.

708
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,920
What was going on when you were here that we were all going, boom, boom, deluxe, da,

709
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,860
da, da, da, da, da, shake my ass, shake my ass.

710
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,580
It was a whole room of people, it was very pretty.

711
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,580
I can totally understand at the MGL tournament too, I think it was, when they were having

712
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,060
that go on, people around the Para Para second mix, I was just walking in the room all of

713
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,300
a sudden you see 30 people doing it, like, holy crap, zombies, run, it's still all over

714
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
again.

715
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,580
You know the sad thing about it in Japan and Hawaii and basically all over the area?

716
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,060
The Para Para dance, there's whole clubs of people who do this.

717
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,220
And everybody dresses the same because, you know, it's easier to do Para Para when you

718
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,060
have no sleeves and everything.

719
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,060
Wait a minute.

720
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,140
Because knowing Elena, I know something about Elena that y'all don't know, so I'm coming

721
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,580
in armed.

722
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,100
Elena, don't you do country line dancing?

723
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Oh, no.

724
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,740
Not since there hasn't been a club in Sacramento.

725
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,500
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

726
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,060
How is country line dancing different than Para Para except the music in Para Para is

727
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,060
better?

728
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:05,060
Well, you know what, I never country line danced without some alcohol in me, so no.

729
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,940
The other thing about Para Para is that...

730
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,940
How's country line dancing?

731
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,940
Say hello to Neil.

732
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,940
That's because with country line dancing you're not doing it alone.

733
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,940
Yes.

734
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,940
You're not looking like a single fool.

735
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,940
You have partners.

736
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,460
And you don't have idiots shadowing behind you.

737
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,460
At actual Para Para clubs, they have everybody doing the same thing with you, it's that everybody

738
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,460
looks like they're all on crack.

739
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,460
You know what that does?

740
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,460
If I took you to a Para Para Club, do you think you could get down and boogie?

741
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,460
You know what, I probably could handle the dance, but I don't think I could.

742
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,460
No offense, you know, I love you.

743
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,460
That was the best thing I've heard all night.

744
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,460
That's so owned.

745
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,460
You get winner points today.

746
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,460
Alaina gets escorted off the show now.

747
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,460
Thank you for being with us tonight, we appreciate it.

748
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,460
Big hugs.

749
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,460
Take care.

750
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
Enjoy Gran Turismo.

751
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,460
This is your new addiction, Gran Turismo.

752
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,460
I was on top, man. 247.9 miles an hour.

753
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
What car are you using?

754
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,460
R something. You know what, we're going to take you to play Initial D someday.

755
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,460
Yes, we will take you to play Initial D.

756
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,460
This is the only game I have played on these new PlayStations.

757
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,460
I have to learn one before I move on to the next.

758
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,460
You're going to graduate to Initial D next week.

759
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,460
And then maybe some Grand Theft Auto after that. We'll see.

760
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Take care, Elena. Big hand for Elena.

761
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,460
I still need to get Vice City.

762
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,460
And Neil was in there too.

763
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,460
I still need to get Vice City so that I can go around and kill people.

764
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,460
You can get hookers to sleep with you?

765
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,460
I don't want a hooker!

766
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,460
See, the thing is, they don't have, you know, like, mansluts out on the street in my game.

767
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
They need to have mansluts.

768
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:42,460
There needs to be... Okay, you know, they just put out Tokimeki Memorial Girlside, where you can, you know, date the boys.

769
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:49,460
I want to have GTA chick version, where you can go pick up the mansluts off the street and...

770
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,460
Some man-whores?

771
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,060

00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,540
I know you would have had your foot in my ass a long time ago.

777
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,540
You wouldn't be eating nuts, but it wouldn't be the ones I bought at the store.

778
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,540
It'd be after I kicked him into your mouth.

779
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,540
Alright, I think we're going to take a really quick break.

780
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,540
Yeah, Rob doesn't want his nuts kicked.

781
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,540
Yeah, I don't want Jamie to kick my nuts right now.

782
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:46,540
We're going to take a quick break, we'll be back, and now is the time in the show when you're going to send us your FUs of the week.

783
00:53:46,540 --> 00:54:00,540
We're going to get some private messages in the chat room to Skye, that's me, and they'll have your FUs of the week, so send those now, and we'll read those on the air when we come back.

784
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,540
Let us know what has you really hacked off.

785
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:10,540
Or, if you're too lazy, you don't want to join our chat room, you want a little bit of anonymity, that's fine, you can send us an email, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

786
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,540
That's fine.

787
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,420
You can send us an email, orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com, and if you say, don't say my name on the air,

788
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,420
we won't.

789
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,420
So you can do your anonymous FUs.

790
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,420
Fair enough.

791
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,420
You can be a wimp.

792
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,060
Jamie, would you like to dedicate this first song during the break?

793
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,420
I dedicate this song to me because I love it.

794
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,420
Alright, here we go.

795
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:54,420
I'm lost inside of me, trapped in a notion Where am I going to?

796
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:01,420
I need to leave, I need to let go

797
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:09,420
Of all the friends I've lost inside my life

798
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,420
I'm not a change of mind

799
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,420
How could I find my way to you?

800
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:28,420
I've been reaching for my love

801
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:34,420
Forever seeking the secrets of my heart

802
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Reaching for the secrets of my love

803
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,420
Like a child

804
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:06,420
How can I find my way to you?

805
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:24,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

806
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:01,380
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

807
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,800
us on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

808
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,200
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

809
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,020
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me, and you just might realize the

810
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,300
the best things in life are for you.

811
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,300
Hey, it's our buddy Mel B. there, saying hello to all of us and all of you listening to Orange

812
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,300
Lounge Radio.

813
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,700
We've got to have him back on the show sometime.

814
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,500
He can pull off that tone very well.

815
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,500
Yes, he's very smooth.

816
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Yeah, he's very smooth.

817
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Yes.

818
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:47,940
Okay, so as promised, it's time to talk about the FUs of the Week.

819
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,460
We can be pissy.

820
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,380
Jamie, why don't you tell us, give us a little background on the FUs of the Week.

821
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,680
This is 22 weeks running now.

822
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,680
No longer than that.

823
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
About 24 weeks running now.

824
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,200
It started with our very first show.

825
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,200
Yes.

826
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,920
Because I was feeling particularly angsty one day and wanted to just vent, vent, vent,

827
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,920
vent.

828
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,920
Well, guess what?

829
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
You all get to hear it.

830
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,280
Well, anyway, the whole thing with having the FUs of the Week is basically, it is our

831
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,280
time to vent.

832
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,080
These are the things that aggravate us.

833
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,080
We're people.

834
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
We're human.

835
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,080
We need to get this out of our system or we'll go crazy and we'll take you with us.

836
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
Anyway.

837
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:27,080
Um, so that's what the F.U.'s the week are for, and eventually the chatroom got as angsty as we did, so we let them in on the fun, too.

838
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:33,080
And you still can, uh, sit in on the fun. If you want to send a share of F.U.'s of the week, you just send those over private message and we'll take care of it.

839
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,080
See, even the stupid ferret has an F.U. of the week.

840
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,080
See?

841
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
Are you ready to begin with your F.U. of the week, Jamie?

842
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,080
Please do.

843
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Let's kick it off!

844
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
Cause this is fucked up.

845
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
Alright.

846
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,080
My, uh, few of the week. I have a few, as usual.

847
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,080
Um, you know, the last few weeks I've been a little bit happier, haven't had too much to bitch about.

848
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,080
Why would I say fuck you to Ragnarok Online?

849
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
This is why, okay?

850
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,080
I've been sitting there for three months waiting for the server to come back up

851
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,080
so that I could get my character back in my lovely little goggles and be happy

852
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
and they're making us pay for it.

853
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,080
Well, that in and of itself is fine. You know, ten dollars for ten bucks.

854
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:20,080
That's not that bad, except the thing is that they have their money in the server.

855
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,080
Well, thank God I didn't pay, because I don't want them to have my credit card number.

856
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,080
So, fuck them, I'll play the Japanese one, which is OPM's winner.

857
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:34,080
And... my next fucking movie goes for, um...

858
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,080
Damn it, I'm gonna put that on the list.

859
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,080
Well, you know, it goes for the fact that I don't have anyone to play Fantasy Star Online with.

860
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
I'm trying. I'll be there soon.

861
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:51,080
We need people, if anybody has Fantasy Star Online and managed to get their hands on a Gamecube broadband adapter, play with me, please!

862
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,080
I don't want to play PSO by myself.

863
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Come play with me!

864
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,080
Would you like to play a game?

865
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Um, other trucks used to be.

866
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,080
Go toward my really awesome band.

867
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,080
Might want to put fire on them.

868
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,080
They're tearing up already and I've had the shoes barely too much.

869
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,080
I love those shoes.

870
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:15,080
those shoes

871
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,160
does stupid people have to drive to work with

872
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,400
oh my god

873
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,160
of the most

874
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
stupid

875
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:29,160
fucking people in the world because they can't drive

876
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,000
i even take the city streets

877
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
because i don't have to take 50 where even more idiots are

878
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,880
and you know what?

879
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,400
they're still idiots

880
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,400
And they don't know how to drive. So, I don't like them.

881
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
They can't have any of my nuts.

882
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,400
SoCalKicks would like to share that he asked for Phantasy Star Online for his birthday.

883
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
So, you never know.

884
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Good luck getting the broadband adapter.

885
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Okay, get this. Nintendo puts out the broadband adapter for the game too.

886
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
F-Nintendo.

887
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
And then recalls the thing.

888
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Well, not necessarily. I don't know if it was called or just if they stopped, you know, making them.

889
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:09,400
But why put out a big multiplayer game, and then stop making the adapter? That's retarded.

890
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Well, anyway, I've got mine, because, you know, my fiance being a manager of Gamestop, you can pull those little strings and take stuff from me.

891
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,400
But, um, in the meantime, you know, I'm gaming about myself.

892
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,400
And also, if I get Animal Crossing, do I really want to start playing Kingdom Hearts again?

893
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,400
Never tell if, like, Kingdom Hearts is that way for just therapy, honestly.

894
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,240
You want to check on your village You want to check on your village

895
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:44,240
You want to go find some looking way You still have 300,000 bells to pay off on

896
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,240
your own Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

897
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,800
Alright, let's hear from Loki, your nephews of the week

898
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:04,520
First up, he has to go to eBay. For a few reasons, actually. One is knowing new ad campaigns

899
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,160
they have going where it's like Broadway singers singing stupid crap about eBay. I really don't

900
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:16,440
want to hear about eBay. eBay is stupid with all these people that bid last minute on stuff.

901
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,140
I was winning the two bids on my, you know, pair of pair of crap in my place of the two, if I kept 21.

902
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:29,240
And, yeah, like, one second left, you know, people bid up, you know, on it, going over the price of it.

903
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:35,240
However, I got one of the fucking bastards back, because he bid up on, uh, what was it, my place of the two?

904
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,440
So I bid up another $30 on it, just to piss him off.

905
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,040
Heh heh. That was cool.

906
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
Amen.

907
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,140
And so he ended up paying, like, a good $40 over of what they were both worth.

908
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:52,140
Okay, so that's that. And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just hate eBay because it sucks.

909
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,140
They don't have anything good on there.

910
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,140
And, you know, I found, you know, a computer machine.

911
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,140
And it was, uh, really cool if I had a little bit of footage, but it's funny right now.

912
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,140
And, uh, oh.

913
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,140
I'll tell you what, my plan is to have an outside chair on the computer machine.

914
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:15,140
If you want a machine to try out your little project on, I will volunteer on it.

915
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:19,140
Woohoo! Okay. But yeah, I won't be long.

916
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,140
Other things, I have to definitely go with the stupid drivers.

917
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:28,140
But the stupid people are in general, you know, everywhere, so I hate that.

918
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:33,140
I also, I really, really, really hate the holidays.

919
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:37,140
And it's not because, you know, I'm like a Scrooge or, you know, I hate that kind of thing.

920
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,140
I just hate, you know, I hate the whole, like, constantly playing Christmas music.

921
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,840
I mean, they have, like, four songs that they play over and over. It's really annoying.

922
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:51,840
I hate, you know, these stupid Christmas tales, and people dressed up like, you know, when they're cold or something.

923
01:06:51,840 --> 01:07:00,340
I'm just... I hate this shit. It's annoying. People are so stupid around the holidays, and... they all suck.

924
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,340
And Christmas lights. What the hell is with that? Seriously.

925
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,540
When did they... everyone is like, well, I have to put some lights in my house for Christmas.

926
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:14,040
I don't understand the point of that. I mean, what, you're trying to, like, flag down spaceships in the land of your fucking house?

927
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,040
You know, we're talking about holidays with, like, you know...

928
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:22,040
I mean, I'm sure, back in tradition, they handled stuff on their Christmas tree.

929
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,040
But I don't think you ever wanted to progress to the point where,

930
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,540
I have a giant plastic snowman in my front lawn! Yay!

931
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,040
There's the houses that are tastefully done, with, you know, few white lights are in there,

932
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,040
but then there's the houses that Christmas throws up on.

933
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:39,040
Yeah, but not when you live in Ghettoville. Ghettoville doesn't have those easily done houses.

934
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Yeah, oh look, there's a giant merkin fly going across the whole court. Whew, fun!

935
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:51,040
And then we're just gonna randomly throw up lights on our house. Yeah, I don't know, I hate that part of Christmas.

936
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,040
And holidays. I hate the commercialization of holidays. It sucks.

937
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:03,040
I don't really have anything this week. I've been kind of...hired, so...

938
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,040
I would like to explain on this little holiday discussion.

939
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,040
Go for it.

940
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:18,040
Okay, everybody knows that I am very tolerant toward other religions and people's beliefs, but I really hate being preached to at Christmas time, okay?

941
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:24,040
I hate when people come to me, you're gonna go to hell if you don't believe this. It's Christmas.

942
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,040
in their Kwanzaa.

943
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,040
Okay.

944
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
I'm going to make-

945
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

946
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Celebrate what you want.

947
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:36,040
All these Christmas pageants and everything, and they have it snowing and crap.

948
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:41,040
First of all, if you want to go historically, the time that they would have, you know, and

949
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,040
this is coming from knowing lots of theologians and everything, if you want to go historically,

950
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,040
when Jesus was born, okay, they were doing a census.

951
01:08:50,040 --> 01:09:01,040
Since this would have been done coming up into the spring season, so therefore they

952
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,680
first of all got season wrong. The reason why Christmas is in the wintertime is because

953
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,040
of the pagan holiday! Hello, you all! You know? Okay then. Give me the whole Christmas

954
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:17,840
tree! It's pagan! Jesus, did I have a Christmas tree at his manger? Okay. How do you know?

955
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:26,240
you there did you see it okay douglas furs did not grow in arabia oh yeah sure not under

956
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,040
the mystical like you know birthing happening here though they just couldn't magically make

957
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,760
a douglas fir appear out of nowhere sure and like you know bushes catch on fire every day

958
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,880
okay what about santa claus

959
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:47,120
damn it hey you little santa people i just sit here i did have to say santa claus saved

960
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,840
day in my movie, Feeders 2, he kicked the ass against those aliens, you know, and Santa

961
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,480
Claus is really, you know, awesome when he has a ray gun.

962
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,480
Remember in Nightmare Before Christmas, Sandy Claus?

963
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:10,480
Well, how can I follow up these? I don't know. I need to start doing my FUs first, because

964
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,360
I'm just not as angsty as I am. Quite frankly, I've had a pretty good week, you know, I have

965
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,200
a lot of that's just to get here that you have to take you to love you thank

966
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,360

james about their fabulous they're going to go mike cuba working but they're

969
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:30,680
beautiful he's you know i thought that once he's been up all you it's so true i

970
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,480
like the one that says i'd

971
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,200
go to fight on ours who can go down

972
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,680
and then he met of course anyway oh yes may have easily

973
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,060
uh... my perception of the week would be the christmas carol's well i was in

974
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,060
Taco Bell the other night listening to Christmas Carols.

975
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:49,660
Oh my god, I'm going to be so nauseatingly sick of Deck the Fucking Halls by the time

976
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,660
25th world's around.

977
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,660
Just you wait.

978
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,660
Just you wait.

979
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,660
I hate Christmas carols.

980
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:58,340
Um, my second FU of the week, um, would be to work, because I don't want to go back.

981
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,740
I've enjoyed this little vacation too much.

982
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,820
I don't want to go either.

983
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:08,260
And uh, my third FU of the week goes to Olivia at Animal Crossing, because she's five-four.

984
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,260
I need to kill Olivia back in my village.

985
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,260
I think we're up for taking Olivia away from me.

986
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,720
you to people who thinks he sucks just because i can't beat max extreme

987
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,960
on the e x level yet

988
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,980
well there's many more reasons you sucked when that's not just the only one

989
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:55,980
skittles let's play it

990
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,940
uh...

991
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,260
all right yes i think there's an f you going out to you i care of the guy's

992
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,460
name

993
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:08,540
i don't remember it was a pretty big remix of let them move

994
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:14,540
cuz he has a sim file, and it reminded me of one of Twin's things. Actually, he said, and I quote,

995
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:20,540
this one's actually worse than the ones I did, so that gives you an idea of how bad this thing is.

996
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:26,540
Alright, back to Twin's FUs.

997
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:30,540
FU to half the chat rooms for not ever taking a joke.

998
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,540
Okay, whatever.

999
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,540
That was funny, haha.

1000
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:38,540
Take your happy FUs and cram them.

1001
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,540
He's at Pensacola. I live from like, near them.

1002
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,540
Really? Alright on.

1003
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:48,540
His girlfriend's from Pensacola. That's like an hour from where I used to live, would be awesome.

1004
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:53,540
Oh, and he's gonna miss Orange Lounge to go spend time with a woman.

1005
01:12:53,540 --> 01:13:00,540
Hey, hey, if you get a benefit from missing the show, you need to spend that time.

1006
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:06,540
If you're going to miss this show for some pussy, then I suppose, you know, we can forgive you.

1007
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,540
Alright, let's see, moving right along.

1008
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,540
You are a horror gauntlet.

1009
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,540
You are a horror gauntlet.

1010
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,540
That's a showgirl's moment, brought to you by horror gauntlet.

1011
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:21,540
Stresa says, um, F you to...

1012
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:25,540
The three days that he's played DDR, he's not that bad at all,

1013
01:13:55,540 --> 01:14:03,340
uh, dear lord, there's a lot, okay, um, F you to people who attended Comdex in Vegas,

1014
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:07,980
you whores made traffic a nightmare, and F you to all the exhibitors especially because

1015
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:13,180
it went for the free stuff, and he left disappointed, Comdex sucks, F you to whoever thought of

1016
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,820
Thanksgiving, now I got a fridge full of leftovers and I'm already sick of turkey, it's all about

1017
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:24,380
the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving because pizza is still good the next day, amen. Uh, time

1018
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:28,180
For the plug, since everybody else got a plug, mostly websites, but while in Vegas, be sure

1019
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:33,260
to visit MidPower's restaurant, Cheerful Chinese Cuisine, in sunny Las Vegas.

1020
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,340
Opened six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, at 1223 East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.

1021
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,340
Call for take-out.

1022
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,900
Uh, oh, shit.

1023
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,740
Wait, we don't want the address broadcast.

1024
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:47,340
And I just read it.

1025
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,340
My bad.

1026
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,340
Not bad.

1027
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:59,900
You need to say it first, then I won't say it.

1028
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:00,900
I'm just reading order.

1029
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,820
I read from top to bottom, top to bottom.

1030
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,020
I think I'm done with his FUs now.

1031
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,020
Let's go to next FUs.

1032
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:12,420
The next set of FUs comes from 23rd Magus.

1033
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,420
I have a big FU to Chatroom Drama because it's there.

1034
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,420
A medium-sized F.U. to Matsuri, Japan, Maniac throwing off my grooves, and a bike-sized F.U.

1035
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,420
I like that, a bike-sized F.U.

1036
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:29,420
To battle.net for screwing up every time he connects, and also a fuck me to any available ladies.

1037
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,420
Whoa, hello.

1038
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,420
Whoa!

1039
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:35,420
Whoa, this isn't hot or not.

1040
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:36,420
Whoa!

1041
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,420
Go sell your meat somewhere else.

1042
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,420
That's right, no selling meat here on Orange Lounge.

1043
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:45,420
Oh, one last F.U. to the school system. I need no explanation. I want all their balls to die.

1044
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,420
I think we need shirts. I think we need shirts that say that.

1045
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,420
I want all your balls to die.

1046
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,420
Should we ask the person who made that shockwave thing?

1047
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,420
Is there a shockwave? I didn't realize there was a shockwave. Oh, my bad.

1048
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:00,420
It's a really bad version of the Romeo and Juliet.

1049
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,420
But there's an even better one, though, that was Harry Potter.

1050
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,420
With the Draco dance.

1051
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,820
Anyway, Vidpower says,

1052
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:13,620
FU of the week goes to germs once again because my voice is all harsh and scraggly

1053
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,220
and whenever I cough my body feels like crap.

1054
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,140
And FU to stupid mean bowling attendants.

1055
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,580
Agreed.

1056
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,860
Brack2000 says

1057
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:27,900
FU to nori nori nori and that one's for 23 minutes.

1058
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:33,460
He's doing an FU on behalf of somebody else.

1059
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:47,460
D.R. Angel says F you to stomp to my beat because it hates Stresa and I and it won't let us pass it.

1060
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,460
good luck.

1061
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:10,500
DDR-holic says, it isn't so much an FU, but just a question. Where have you guys been

1062
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,200
on Wednesdays? Do you guys go to RV jail on another day or have you just been busy? Oh,

1063
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,580
but she does want to second Loki's FU to the commercialism of the holidays, especially

1064
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,040
the competition. Who freaking cares who has the most expensive decorations? Amen, system.

1065
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,380
Just for a second there, guys. We keep reading your name. I'm sorry, I'm saying DDR-holic.

1066
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,860
That's a different person.

1067
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,860
Coholic.

1068
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,860
Like an alcoholic.

1069
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,860
Like an alcoholic.

1070
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,860
Okay. My bad.

1071
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,860
This is why I'm not in real radio.

1072
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,860
DDR Coholic.

1073
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,860
DDR Coholic. Coholic.

1074
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,860
I love the song Holic so much I just want to say that.

1075
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,860
Holic holic holic.

1076
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,860
So we got it.

1077
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:52,860
Orange Lounge is a international program so we don't like to dwell on the local stuff too much, but

1078
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:58,860
Yes, we've been flacking on Wednesdays lately. That's mostly my bad because I do other things on Wednesday nights now.

1079
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:03,860
But Jamie and I have made a commitment to go to Golf Land once a week starting this week.

1080
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,860
And probably on Thursday, actually, not Wednesday. So we'll see.

1081
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,860
It's a little bit easier to get there on Thursday.

1082
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:09,860
A little bit easier for us to get there on Thursday.

1083
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,860
Sometimes it may transfer the time to Scandia because we love Scandia so much more.

1084
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,860
But you know what? DDRcoholicDear, send me an email. Send the show an email.

1085
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,860
Oh well, who cares. Neither is cowgirl, but hey.

1086
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:56,860
I'd say fuck you to second-hand smoke, because I really, really, really hate cigarette smoke.

1087
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:00,860
It's like one of my most hated smells in the entire world.

1088
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:05,860
And especially bad because in one of the local arcade, R2-GL,

1089
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:10,860
guitar freaks and drumming is kind of close to the front door,

1090
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,860
So often I smell the smoke from the parents who I've spoken to a few times.

1091
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,860
Packed with tin.

1092
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,860
Chilled my lungs for a while.

1093
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,860
And also put me to the cigarette smoke that's close to my heart.

1094
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,860
Some mysterious location.

1095
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,860
I don't hear any air ducts or from the cracks in the windows or something.

1096
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,860
There's some noise and a lot of it.

1097
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:42,860
And this week, my feud of myself for being a saltless bastard is never calling my parents.

1098
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,860
And they are my relatives for Thanksgiving.

1099
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,860
Ah, that's right. Thanksgiving is a commercial holiday. It's a butterballing event, and don't worry about it.

1100
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,860
It's around the other side of the country.

1101
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,860
Of course, they haven't heard from me in a while, so I have to think about it.

1102
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,860
My back's in serious trouble.

1103
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,860
I'm glad to talk to them.

1104
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,860
All right.

1105
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:07,860
Sorry, I have to talk to you, but I'm coming over. Save me a room.

1106
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,860
I did that to my head.

1107
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:12,660
He says, my fuck yous would be the damn expansion pack enemies in Diablo II and dumb weathermen

1108
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:16,060
for getting me all excited about a snowstorm that turned into nothing.

1109
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,420
Fuck those weathermen.

1110
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:23,940
You know, I actually was going to be a weatherman.

1111
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,700
I think that's where it came from, I don't know.

1112
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:31,620
Anyway, and then we have some FUs from Martin, who's the guy that sent us the email earlier

1113
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,620
in the show.

1114
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,620
He's got a lot too.

1115
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:35,860
He says, fuck Christmas shopping for all the crazy people.

1116
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,580
to crazy people to shop during the Christmas shopping season. Fuck my manager for making

1117
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:44,160
me work the day after Thanksgiving and not giving me hazard pay. Fuck the blue whale

1118
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:51,660
for not living on land. Fuck my teacher for saying the word land in a question that could

1119
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:56,860
have given my class a pizza party. I don't know what that means. Just not saying the

1120
01:21:56,860 --> 01:22:02,620
word land. I don't know. Fuck the African elephant for being so big. Yes! Fuck the African

1121
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:11,220
elephant you you too big too big fuck the arcade for banning me for a week for

1122
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:18,540
matrix walking shame shame you shouldn't be kicking machine this is this banning

1123
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:22,020
is a little harsh if they if they didn't tell you not to do it then they should

1124
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:25,300
at least have a courtesy warning but if they warned you and said don't do it if

1125
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:29,260
you did it again and have much sympathy for you you got to respect their case

1126
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,940
rules but if they just kicked out with no warning that's not that's not cool so

1127
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:36,940
Fuck his computer for not being compatible with a 3D Excelic Creator card.

1128
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:37,940
Do you have a Mac?

1129
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:38,940
He must be on the back.

1130
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,940
Got a Mac.

1131
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,940
That's it, that's the FUs of the week.

1132
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:45,940
And they were special.

1133
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,940
All of them wrapped into one big little...

1134
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:48,940
Uh oh, we have another.

1135
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:52,940
Oh! Oh, I got a response from ddrcoholic says,

1136
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:56,940
I can say holic if I want because it can be my nickname for her.

1137
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,940
So I get to call her ddrholic if I want.

1138
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:04,940
And one quick F.U. because of the little image that flashes upon your screen while you're closing down Yahoo.

1139
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:09,940
F.U. to that stupid movie Extreme Ops because that's the pissed pile of shit I've ever seen.

1140
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,940
Look at that! Oh, we're gonna add extreme people in a spy situation.

1141
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,940
Wait, that's never been done before. Oh, wait, yeah it was.

1142
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:22,940
So, yeah, F.U. for these stupid extreme spy movies. No one wants us to get it, no one cares.

1143
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:24,940
Fuck bad movies.

1144
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:30,540
But the right here knows actually know when the bad movies are like really really really bad like they know they're bad

1145
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:34,700
There's nothing bad that those are awesome. Those are cool, but like bad movies like

1146
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:44,860
Stray so wants to add the very last if you fuck lawyers fuck I'm

1147
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,700
Yeah

1148
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,260
Okay, we're gonna take a quick break

1149
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:54,260
We're going to come back, and we're going to actually talk about some Bimani-related things.

1150
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:57,260
Believe it or not, we have a few topics we wanted to talk about before the night was over.

1151
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:01,260
And also, when we come back, we will have the cage match.

1152
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,260
This week's Orange Launch cage match will take place.

1153
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:09,260
And I think that's about it on the platter for now.

1154
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,260
All sorts of fun, Bimani music and then some.

1155
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:17,260
We're going to start this music break off with a little song from 2DX6 style.

1156
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,260
It's a very popular one. You may have heard it a couple times.

1157
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,260
It's going to be in DDR Extreme as well.

1158
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,260
Enjoy, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1159
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,260
Oh

1160
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:30,580
Hi, we're back. We're going to do a quick mic check here. No, see, we're not coming

1161
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:34,860
through if I don't turn that booster on. There, now you can hear us, see? We're trying to

1162
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:39,460
fix our audio problems right now here in house. Let me see if we can turn down the volume

1163
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:44,620
a little bit. Can you still hear us just fine? Hello, hello. Can you hear me now? Can you

1164
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:50,380
hear me now? Can you hear me now? Whee! Where I still hear it a little bit, though, it's

1165
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:22,380
We'll be right back.

1166
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:41,380
I see you in a suit, whichever you want I'm with you, oh, you're with me

1167
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,380
You, keep me strong, I'll cover you

1168
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,380
You're the one I need tonight

1169
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,380
Find a way from the start

1170
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,380
It's time to pull me out

1171
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,380
Let's face it enough

1172
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:02,380
You're the one I need tonight

1173
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,380
From heaven so you'll find

1174
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,380
Can you hear me, baby?

1175
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,380
Can you hear me, baby?

1176
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,380
Can you hear me, baby?

1177
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,380
Can you see all the world we live in?

1178
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:20,380
All the time

1179
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:24,380
We can be born again

1180
01:30:54,380 --> 01:31:11,620
Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have

1181
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,620
some joy.

1182
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:19,120
Little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, Go out and have some joy!

1183
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:25,600
Doo doo dee da da da da doo da da dee da da da

1184
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:31,920
Doo doo dee da da da da da doo da da dee da da da

1185
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,920
Dream on, dream on, make my day You will find a better way

1186
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,240
Dream on and you'll realize, that one day you'll pay the price

1187
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,360
Keep on going till tomorrow, you will find there is no sorrow

1188
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,460
Keep on dreaming of this toy you can use my little boy

1189
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:03,920
Little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go on and have some joy

1190
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:10,240
My little boy came home, my little boy came home, my little boy go home and have some fun

1191
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,380
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-ee-dee-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-oo

1192
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:16,500
Da-da-da-dee-dah-dah-dah

1193
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,740
Ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-ee-dah-dah-dah-dah-oo

1194
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,860
Da-da-dee-dah-dah-dah

1195
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,860
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-ee-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-oo

1196
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,460
Da-da-dee-dah-dah-dah

1197
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:33,680
Ooh-ooh-ooh-doo-ee-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-oo

1198
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,680
La da dee da da

1199
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:10,680
From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bahmani stuff, comes our Bahmani science lesson

1200
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:26,080
From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bahmani stuff, comes our Bahmani science lesson

1201
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,080
of the day.

1202
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:35,080
Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

1203
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:40,200
Hooray, a fan-made promo we got.

1204
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:45,560
And it has TAC, so it already gets Jamie's seal of approval.

1205
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,560
We like that.

1206
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,020
Thank you, 23 Megas, for sending us that promo, although it is a little quiet.

1207
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:54,480
You do want to double check and make sure that it's always nice and loud, that your

1208
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,120
levels are somewhere in the yellow.

1209
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,600
Not in the red, but just in the tip of the yellow.

1210
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,560
Just a little recording advice tip from me, but otherwise, fantastic, we love it.

1211
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,920
Let's see, let's talk about some actual Bamani news this week, shall we?

1212
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,920
No.

1213
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,320
news, but just kind of some interesting little things.

1214
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,920
Does it say money old?

1215
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,400
Yeah, it's money old.

1216
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,000
There was an interesting thread that came up on one of the big message boards

1217
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,200
this week that talks about a solo machine that was upgraded to a MAX2.

1218
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,160
What?

1219
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:31,440
Somebody had took a solo machine and upgraded it to a MAX2.

1220
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,720
What is the freaking point?

1221
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,840
Because if you recall, MAX2 has no six panel mode in it.

1222
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:41,040
So you've pretty much just taken two of your arrows and completely wasted them.

1223
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,760
I'm bringing a picture here in the room so that

1224
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,480
Jamie can take a look for herself, see what this machine's all about.

1225
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,600
What do you think it's...

1226
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,600
Loki, I gotta get your opinion on this, being the Tecmasa.

1227
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,720
Wait, it curves the bar forward.

1228
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,560
Well that's a typical solo bar. A solo bar looks like that.

1229
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,840
That means it's actually a Japanese machine, by the way.

1230
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,000
You can rate the bar in a whole new way.

1231
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,760
That means that that's a Japanese machine.

1232
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,760
They just put us DDR Max Upgrading a solo machine. What more do you need to know?

1233
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,760
That's all they did. There's no modifications to it at all. There's just no way they're going to play doubles.

1234
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,760
And it's actually kind of retarded because people like doubles are fucked.

1235
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:26,760
Yeah, I'm looking at this. I'm looking at the solo score ranking here. It's always going to be empty forever.

1236
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:31,760
You're fucked if you pick doubles. It's retarded unless it's your own home thing and that's all you've got.

1237
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:38,760
It's a solo machine, but it's really stupid. Go to 4th plus or even that unofficial 5th mix.

1238
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,760
I mean, just don't stick with it.

1239
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,760
You can always get best hits, ooh.

1240
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:49,760
Here's the cream of the crop. As it says in the post, I believe it says in the post somewhere, it says later.

1241
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,760
Oh yeah, and then there's a regular Max 2 machine, just 2 machines over from this.

1242
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,760
That's so stupid.

1243
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,760
That's retarded.

1244
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,760
Don't!

1245
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:05,440
That gets the Special Olympic Ward stamp of the day.

1246
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,840
Go figure, this guy's in Canada.

1247
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,840
Just kidding, just kidding.

1248
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,160
I just want to say controversial things on this program, what can I say?

1249
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,160
Let's see...

1250
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,160
That goes with my hatred of the Greek.

1251
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,160
Or wait, it was Greek?

1252
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,480
Yeah, but you have a good reason to hate them, because they banned games.

1253
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,200
Because they're stupid.

1254
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,560
I watched my big fat Greek wedding.

1255
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:28,560
Did you?

1256
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,560
That totally sounds like a movie you would not like.

1257
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:32,560
Yeah, it was alright.

1258
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,560
Loki, it sounds like a movie.

1259
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,560
Oh, Brad, what do you think of this? It's a Max 2 solo machine.

1260
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,560
I'm gonna go play Amakasa.

1261
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,560
Good answer, good answer.

1262
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,560
That wins my special enough at the Olympic stamp award of the day.

1263
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,560
They get to ride the short bus.

1264
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,560
With their own Max solo machine, ooh.

1265
01:37:53,560 --> 01:38:03,560
The only thing that could be possibly worse than a Max 2 solo machine is a Max 1 solo machine or a solo bass.

1266
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:09,560
No, I think a solo bass is slightly better. At least it has my baby mama.

1267
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:18,560
I wouldn't exactly say upgrading. Downgrading a Max 2 full machine to a solo bass.

1268
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,560
That's retarded right there.

1269
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:26,560
The only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is somebody playing Burning Heat on that Max 2 solo machine.

1270
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,560
No, I'm kidding.

1271
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:28,560
God. Okay.

1272
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,560
Oh, yes, yes.

1273
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:39,560
I know this is a few episodes back, but the only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is upskirt Beatmania 5-key.

1274
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,560
No, the cam.

1275
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,560
Anyway.

1276
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,560
Let's talk about another topic, shall we?

1277
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:48,560
Next, please.

1278
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,560
Moving right along.

1279
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:57,720
Oh, yes, we were talking about another interesting thread that I saw was about this kind of...

1280
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:02,320
Since the Christmas season is here, there's this sudden push, and DDR is getting bigger

1281
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,660
and bigger, and more and more well-known, and bigger and bitter, and we're all getting

1282
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:08,760
bitter, as the jaded old-schoolers we are.

1283
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:14,500
We see that there's these new children's dance pats games coming out, including a Barney

1284
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:18,680
game, a Barbie dance game that you plug directly into your TV.

1285
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,760
It's been out for a while, but of course it's Christmas time, so a lot of the stores are

1286
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,080
pushing these again.

1287
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,560
You know, here's a Christmas toy that won't make your kid fat.

1288
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,520
That's basically how they're marketing these.

1289
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,940
This just gives them all the vibrating Nimbus 2000s.

1290
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,640
This is very old.

1291
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,840
The Jungle Book Dancing Game.

1292
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,680
Now for those who don't know out there, this was out before Max USA even was.

1293
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,440
I remember going to your old apartment.

1294
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,160
I had the Jungle Book Dance Game.

1295
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:45,080
Giving you third kicks and playing on that tiny ass little pad.

1296
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,840
The Jungle Book Dance Pad was my very first dance pad.

1297
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,240
I actually have the Jungle Book game, too, but I don't have the pad.

1298
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,000
And Jamie brought over third mix one night, and we played all night long.

1299
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,800
It was so much fun.

1300
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,880
Here, let me liberate your mind.

1301
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,640
It was beautiful.

1302
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,360
Before that, all I'd ever seen was USA and first mix.

1303
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,560
And all of a sudden, you put in third mix.

1304
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,120
I'm like, oh my god.

1305
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:05,920
There's modes.

1306
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,160
Holiday, erotic, I'm in love.

1307
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,000
And it was karaoke mode, too.

1308
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,520
Yes, and karaoke mode.

1309
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,720
Wish there was nothing in another mix.

1310
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,080
Now, uh, what do you guys think of all these little kid games?

1311
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,920
You think it's good for Bimani because it trains them at a young age?

1312
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,120
I want the Hello Kitty DDR just for five-year-olds.

1313
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:29,320
It's actually a DDR.

1314
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,320
Where's the Oha Kids arcade games?

1315
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,320
Don't they have one in Vegas?

1316
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:38,320
Did you say at that one arcade you went to they had a DDR for kids?

1317
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,320
No.

1318
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,320
I'm just on crack, I'm sorry.

1319
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,640
They had Radiant Silver Gun.

1320
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,640
Oh.

1321
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,020
Who had the DDR for kids?

1322
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:51,020
I could have sworn somebody told me somebody in Vegas had them.

1323
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:54,860
Very interesting.

1324
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:59,860
I would call some people in the chat room are talking about Disney's rave being a kid

1325
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:05,340
game or I'm sorry Disney Mix in the U.S. I don't know.

1326
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,180
You think Disney's Mix is for kids?

1327
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:10,020
I think Dance Magic makes Disney Mix though.

1328
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:15,020
these raves for people who are like, I would like Para Para, but I want to get into DDR.

1329
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:20,020
Boom, there you go. That's what it is. It's just all, it's DDR Para Para mix.

1330
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:24,180
Vidpower, who's from Vegas, by the way, is confirming they do have a DDR Kids machine

1331
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,580
there. I don't know if that means it's OHA. Is it OHA songs? Vidpower, what are the songs

1332
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:35,780
in DDR Kids? Is it OHA stuff, or what is it? I'm just kind of asking questions to our chat

1333
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,780
waiting for a reply.

1334
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,280
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1335
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:43,280
Yeah.

1336
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,280
Oh, what are you guys talking about over there?

1337
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:45,780
Share with us.

1338
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:48,280
We're talking about Game Land in Las Vegas.

1339
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,280
OK, talk about Game Land.

1340
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,280
Oh, Game Land has DDR Kids.

1341
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:52,780
No.

1342
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,780
It's being confirmed by VidPower.

1343
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:54,780
VidPower's from Vegas.

1344
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,780
And they must have gotten it after I played there,

1345
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:58,280
because I was there for the DDRP moderator trip.

1346
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,280
Possible.

1347
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:05,280
And what they had, I went in there, and this is actually,

1348
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:10,280
When everybody was quoting each other, what we sent for the moderator trip, this is what I was quoted as going,

1349
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,280
Eeee, radiant silver gun!

1350
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,280
Oh, it's not OHA songs, I'm being corrected.

1351
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,280
It's just different songs.

1352
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,280
That's all I can get.

1353
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,280
Special.

1354
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,280
Different places!

1355
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,280
Hey, get us a song list.

1356
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,280
Yeah, get us a song list.

1357
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,280
We want to talk about it.

1358
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,280
We want to come play.

1359
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,280
We're going to go to Vegas.

1360
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:29,280
We're planning an Orange Lounge Vegas trip at some point.

1361
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,280
Yeah, and someone can pay for it.

1362
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,280
Oh, VidPower does confirm they got it after you were there.

1363
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:34,780
Okay.

1364
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:11,280
on the radio already. That's the Black Mage. Yeah, it says Bolt 2 motherfucker.

1365
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:15,840
Other big things in the news. This is big news. It has really nothing to do with Bimani,

1366
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:20,280
but it's big news in the gaming world. As most Bimani people are a bunch of big gaming

1367
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:25,600
addicts, we thought we'd mention it. Square and Enix. Enix bought Square. Did this little

1368
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,800
merger type thing. I thought that it was a merger of equals because of their name. It's

1369
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,720
a merger of equals. No, but once I looked at the stuff I'm going to have to go check

1370
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:39,880
the business sites to confirm it, but I think that Enix holds a 70-80% share, so it's not

1371
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,360
a pure merger of equals.

1372
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,660
If it was a merger of equals, the ratio would be no more than 10% different.

1373
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:47,560
Any thoughts on what's going to happen because of this?

1374
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:54,240
We're going to be getting Final Quest Fantasy X with all of the art done by Toriyama.

1375
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,240
Urgits!

1376
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,240
Urgits!

1377
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,320
I want more urgits!

1378
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,320
Really the fighting game, right?

1379
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:07,320
We're going to get air guys with the Dragon Quest characters.

1380
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:12,320
Well, you know, didn't Aenix, weren't they responsible for Busta Group?

1381
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
Busta Move.

1382
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:20,320
Yes, Aenix and Metro were responsible for Busta Move and Busta Move 2.

1383
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:26,320
They're also, you know, I still haven't gotten to play Busta Move 2001 or whatever the hell it was.

1384
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,320
DDR Busta Move 2003 with Cloud and Yuffie, oh my god.

1385
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:35,320
But it's also just Star Ocean.

1386
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,320
I honestly don't think they're going to be lame and start crossing all their story lines.

1387
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
I don't think a damn thing's going to change.

1388
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,320
Even better than all those, though, is Actraiser Soulblazer.

1389
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,320
Actraiser. Actraiser was the best game ever.

1390
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:51,320
So moist.

1391
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:55,320
Since What's-His-Name Uematsu is not going to do Final Fantasy music anymore, they're phasing him out,

1392
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,320
they need to get that guy who did Actraiser's music.

1393
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,320
They need to get him.

1394
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
That's going to be the best thing about this.

1395
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:06,320
Actually, come to think of it, the pre-show disc, I actually have an Overclocked remix of the Filmore theme.

1396
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,320
I love the... oh yeah, Act eraser.

1397
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:13,320
Anyway, you know, Dan and I had a discussion about this.

1398
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:20,320
And for anybody who has ever heard me, who knows me and Dan, or has heard me talk about him or us talk,

1399
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:25,320
we're both really major gamers. We own like 42 million game systems.

1400
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:26,320
No.

1401
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:33,880
Anyway, we were having this discussion and we decided that it might be a good thing because

1402
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:43,400
I want to catch Aynix up to the modern day and teach Square how to be old school again.

1403
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,200
This is happening for a couple reasons.

1404
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:52,280
A, Final Fantasy XI fucking tanked in Japan because they fucked it up.

1405
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:55,360
They completely fucked up that hard drive thing in the online...

1406
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,800
Like the movie? Bad idea.

1407
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:03,800
Final Fantasy Online was a bad idea. Square Japan had nothing to do with the movie, and the movie was actually good and it just shouldn't have been called Final Fantasy.

1408
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,760
The movie fucked it up for Square. Honestly,

1409
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,740
the movie was decent, but it wasn't... I think Pixar's interested in it now. It was not Final Fantasy.

1410
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:17,020
They should not have been called Final Fantasy. Did not deserve the Final Fantasy name. As a movie, the movie was good.

1411
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:18,880
The movie was excellent.

1412
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,880
But it wasn't Final Fantasy.

1413
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,880
Right.

1414
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,880
It wasn't Final Fantasy.

1415
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,880
Thank you.

1416
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,000
That's all I have to say on that.

1417
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,280
But, and this is what I always said with a friend of mine who always talked about this

1418
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,680
too, we should, because the movie was really being designed about the time the eight was

1419
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,680
made.

1420
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:38,240
Honestly, the movie should have been a game and eight should have been the movie.

1421
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,000
Eight would have been an excellent movie and it made a horrible game.

1422
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,400
Or ten as the movie.

1423
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:47,000
But ten, see ten, the thing with Final Fantasy, I can't believe we're talking about Final

1424
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:59,000
The thing with Final Fantasy X is that the way it's designed is that next generation of movie slash game. You don't see it as a movie.

1425
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It's a cinematic RPG.

1426
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I would have liked if they created a movie that's kind of a cross between VII and X.

1427
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,760
7 and 10. Because 7 had really cool futuristic worlds and all the machines and stuff. And

1428
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:16,920
then 10 had that really kick-ass stuff in it too. Which I love. I love that one song,

1429
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,440
Otherworld, that's in the very beginning. That's the heavy metal music that's in it.

1430
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,880
It's fucking awesome. I love that song.

1431
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:30,880
Well, you know, one thing. I was reading an interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who was like

1432
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,760
the best artist in the world, who did all of the original character designs for the

1433
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,800
first Final Fantasy games, one through six.

1434
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,120
He didn't do any of the character designs for seven or eight, he did them for nine,

1435
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,800
but he was very discouraged by the direction that the Final Fantasy series was going in,

1436
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:57,640
that it was leaving the fantasy behind, and so that was always why I agreed that the earlier

1437
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,640
games were the best.

1438
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:04,640
My favorite Final Fantasy game is 5, followed by 3, but I've got to play a 3.

1439
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:09,640
4 was okay, 6 was really excellent, but I liked the whole job class thing in 5.

1440
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,640
Everybody our age that played video games will always remember the Final Fantasy 6 opera.

1441
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:19,640
No, it's always for me, them in the magitech armor walking across the ice plane.

1442
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:20,640
That too, yeah, that too.

1443
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Just, oh, it's so nostalgic, what can you say?

1444
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,640
I have a special message for Gumby?

1445
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,640
You!

1446
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,640
That's all.

1447
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,640
What was that?

1448
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,640
He's teasing me because my voice is cracking.

1449
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,640
Oh my god.

1450
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,200
Can we just call you Ron Weasley now?

1451
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,200
Shut up!

1452
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,200
Shut up!

1453
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,200
No, he doesn't have the red hat.

1454
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:40,200
Shut up.

1455
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,200
Alright.

1456
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,560
We'll just put you in a Ford and have you drive him around.

1457
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,080
Speaking of Final Fantasy, why don't we get to this week's cage match, shall we?

1458
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,080
Unless anything else...

1459
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,080
Cage match!

1460
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,960
Does anybody else have something to say about Square Enix merging?

1461
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,600
Does anyone really give a shit?

1462
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,600
I don't give a shit, personally.

1463
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,120
A couple of comics ago, you said something about it, you can't believe we're talking

1464
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,120
about Final Fantasy.

1465
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:02,120
I can make a, what is it, a Kevin Bacon thing, six degrees or whatever.

1466
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,120
Probably excuse me, my Squaresoft.

1467
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:06,120
Squaresoft made a game called Brave Fencer Musashi.

1468
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:10,120
At the end of Brave Fencer Musashi, there's a music dance game that's pretty much like DDR.

1469
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,120
But it's, yeah, actually it's like Simon Says.

1470
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:12,120
Really?

1471
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,120
There you go, yep.

1472
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,120
Damn, I gotta play that game now.

1473
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:22,120
There's a DDR mode in SNK versus Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

1474
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,120
That's not Squaresoft.

1475
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,120
But there's DDR.

1476
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:31,620
On a total different tangent here, the chat room is now trying to put us all with Harry

1477
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,620
Potter characters.

1478
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:33,620
Jamie, you're now Aromone.

1479
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,900
I would not be Hermione, hello?

1480
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:40,980
Okay, because first of all, with every damn sorting test I've ever taken, I always come

1481
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:41,980
up Slytherin.

1482
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:45,180
She's Draco because she's evil.

1483
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:48,260
And I guess that leaves Loki to be Harry Potter.

1484
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,800
Get the glasses!

1485
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,060
I have glasses and I don't look like Harry Potter.

1486
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:58,580
We can draw like a little lightning scar on his head.

1487
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:02,900
I'm not going to be pansy, hello.

1488
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:04,300
Alright.

1489
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:11,500
Oh yes, another excellent, on the Square Enix merger, they're saying that April 1st is when

1490
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:15,880
this is supposed to happen so it causes a lot of skepticism, however, if I'm not mistaking

1491
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,460
this news that's coming out of Japan, April 1st doesn't mean shit in Japan.

1492
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,420
There's no April 1st.

1493
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:23,420
So it doesn't matter, but I don't know, who knows?

1494
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:25,420
Don't put Americans in their April Foothills.

1495
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:27,420
We could all get...

1496
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,420
We could all be having the wool pulled over our eyes on this.

1497
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:31,420
Like I said, I don't think it's really going to matter anyway.

1498
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,420
So what? They merge. Big fucking deal.

1499
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,420
I don't care.

1500
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,420
Next.

1501
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,420
Next.

1502
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:43,420
I'm going to turn on the app here because I need some in-studio sound to deal with this...

1503
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:47,420
We apologize for the humming again. We don't know what's causing it.

1504
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:51,220
We're going to take a hammer to the computer after the show and figure out what's going

1505
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,220
on.

1506
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,220
So, we apologize.

1507
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,220
It's something to do with the mics.

1508
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,220
Maybe our mics are just cheap.

1509
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,220
I don't know.

1510
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,220
Let's go get some new ones.

1511
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,480
Anyway, let's talk about the cage match.

1512
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,660
Would you like to explain the rules for the cage match?

1513
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,460
The lovely Miss Dark Sakura.

1514
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,700
We're going to play some songs, and you tell us if it sucks or not.

1515
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:14,220
Basically, okay, for anybody who watches TV, which I don't, but I've seen American Idol,

1516
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:17,900
We're going to place a couple songs all the way through, and then we're going to review

1517
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:18,900
them.

1518
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,220
Ashley, we're just going to play a clip of last...

1519
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:23,300
You can vote for last week's winner, but we're only going to play a small clip of it.

1520
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,300
We're going to play a clip of last week's winner.

1521
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:28,420
Because you all have been listening to our Bomani Music Amore program, airing 24 hours

1522
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,620
a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're not on, and you've heard it already, right?

1523
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:32,620
Yes?

1524
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:33,620
Yes.

1525
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,620
You don't need to play it all again.

1526
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:37,620
So we're going to give our opinions on the songs again.

1527
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,740
Of course, the new one's going to be played all the way through.

1528
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:45,820
You as the chat room get to decide which one of these is going to be our next big thing.

1529
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:49,180
So the winner of the cage match will be put into rotation on the normal Bimani Musica

1530
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,180
Morpher M this week.

1531
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,380
So you're going to vote for a winner.

1532
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:57,500
Now you can vote for last week's victor, but once last week's winner wins what?

1533
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,500
Once the song wins what?

1534
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,900
Three, four weeks, we retire it and it can't win anymore.

1535
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:01,900
What do we think?

1536
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:02,900
Four weeks?

1537
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:03,900
Three?

1538
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:06,340
Give it a month.

1539
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,340
We give it a month.

1540
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:08,340
Okay, so four weeks.

1541
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:13,880
for four weeks, it gets retired. Yeah, then it goes in permanently. So, this is our winner

1542
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:20,880
from last week, was the Final Fantasy Music DJ. This was an overclocked remix of... I'm

1543
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,080
sorry, yes, Loki, would you like to explain last week's victor?

1544
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:31,080
It was a remix from Final Fantasy VII. It's the, uh, quick, very squishy, uh, 4L prison

1545
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:54,080
Alright, that was last week's victor, the Corelle Prison remix theme, overclocked remix

1546
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,700
by FFMusicDJ.

1547
01:52:55,700 --> 01:53:00,280
So you can vote for that, or you can vote for something new!

1548
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:05,400
new and in the mix this week we have this is something for the pre-show but

1549
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:09,600
it's so fucking cool we're putting it in the cage match Jamie please tell us I

1550
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:14,160
was looking for happy hardcore remakes last night and I found the Knight Rider

1551
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:20,160
theme if who remembers watching David Hasselhoff with his hair and the car I

1552
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:29,120
was in third grade David Hasselhoff was just like in the 80s he was cool and

1553
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:31,120
David Hasselhoff, he's so dreamy.

1554
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:35,120
And then there was Baywatch, and he's loved in Germany.

1555
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,120
I think we should just play the song.

1556
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:42,120
Alright, so the first song, and remember you cannot vote until the second song is finished playing.

1557
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:46,120
So we're going to play the first song for you in today's cage match.

1558
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:50,120
This is the Knight Rider theme from Happy Hardcore. Enjoy.

1559
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,120
My bad, it's not from Happy 2D Hardcore, it's just a random mix.

1560
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:03,120
here it is

1561
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:58,120
Oh

1562
01:56:56,120 --> 01:57:08,480
Alright, the cage match is in effect here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1563
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,000
That was the Knight Rider theme.

1564
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
What did you guys think of that here in the room?

1565
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Jamie?

1566
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
God damn, that was cool.

1567
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Alright.

1568
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Dave, what did you think of the Knight Rider theme?

1569
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
It was pretty cool.

1570
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

1571
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Alright.

1572
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Loki?

1573
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I liked it.

1574
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I liked the original theme.

1575
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I liked it. I liked the original theme. It kind of lost a little bit of it in the middle there. I liked the pointy part of it.

1576
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Bradley, your thoughts on the Knight Rider mix?

1577
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It's pretty good.

1578
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Pretty good. I'd have to say it's cool for about the first minute when that nostalgia kicks in, but three minutes of it is a little bit much. I don't know.

1579
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Alright, rate it on a scale of one to ten. Jamie, on a scale of one to ten?

1580
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Nine.

1581
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Nine. Dave?

1582
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Eight.

1583
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Eight. Logie?

1584
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,120
8.

1585
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:53,120
Bradley?

1586
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:53,800
7.

1587
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,820
7. And I'll give it, I'll give it a 7.5.

1588
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:56,820
Alright.

1589
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,740
So, I'm a harsh judge, what can I say.

1590
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:00,000
Alright, that was the Knight Rider theme.

1591
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,720
So, we got one more song here for the CAGED match,

1592
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,700
and I'm gonna play that for you right now.

1593
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,380
It's coming off a CD, so I don't know how this is gonna work.

1594
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:15,540
Might be a little weird, but,

1595
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:20,540
This is a remix done by Hybrid of the Crystal Method, the name of the game.

1596
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:23,540
It's Hybrid's L.A. Blackout remix.

1597
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:26,540
Alright, this is the second one in the Orange Launch Radio Cage match.

1598
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:33,540
the crystal method with the name of the game.

1599
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:27,540
Hey!

1600
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:28,540
Hey!

1601
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,540
Hey!

1602
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,540
Hey!

1603
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:31,540
Hey!

1604
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:32,540
Hey!

1605
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:33,540
Hey!

1606
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:34,540
Hey!

1607
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:35,540
Hey!

1608
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,540
Hey!

1609
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:37,540
Hey!

1610
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,540
Oh

1611
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:36,540
Callin' y'all freaks now Callin' y'all freaks now

1612
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,540
All in all freaks now

1613
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,540
Got the pain, hold it

1614
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,540
All in all freaks

1615
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:54,540
All in all freaks now

1616
02:03:54,540 --> 02:04:21,060
All right, that was Crystal Method with the name of the game.

1617
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:22,460
Jamie, your thoughts on that?

1618
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:25,100
oh you're yawning over there

1619
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:27,460
boring you okay i think

1620
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,820
your thoughts

1621
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:32,000
well if you have the right idea cut it down

1622
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,660
yes

1623
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:36,660
rats in the room what do you think about eating to come in the last one what do you think of this one

1624
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:43,660
well the original song has always been my favorite song ever

1625
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:49,100
haha what do you think of it

1626
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,140
i like the song

1627
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:57,140
Obviously, yes, it was too long. The original one is also my favorite Chris Benson song ever.

1628
02:04:57,140 --> 02:05:05,140
I do have to add, though, that this is my turn. It's a terrific pre-entry, except I haven't touched it down in two and a half minutes.

1629
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:08,140
No longer is it two and a half minutes, but yeah, I like it.

1630
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:10,140
Bradley, your thoughts?

1631
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:11,140
It's been really good.

1632
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:12,140
It's been really good.

1633
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:18,140
My thoughts, it's a cool song for a minute and a half.

1634
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:24,140
Same thing, same thing as the last song. Little long, little long for me, but I bet it's gonna kick a lot of ass in DDR, uh, in DDR, shouldn't it?

1635
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:27,140
Let's break it down, scale of one to ten, Jamie.

1636
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:31,140
They have lots of parts that I like, and they have parts that I'm looking forward to.

1637
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:34,140
I'd give it a six and a half.

1638
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:36,140
Six and a half from Jamie. Dave.

1639
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:44,140
Yeah, I mean, whenever it switched to a new part, then it was cool, but then it kept going on that part for like a minute and a half each.

1640
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:47,140
So, um, I'll be generous, I'll give it a seven.

1641
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:49,140
Seven. Brad.

1642
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:51,140
Since I didn't hear their whole song, I have to be fair.

1643
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,140
I guess I can't give it a ten or anything.

1644
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:57,140
But I mean, it sounded good when I heard it, so I guess I'll give it a seven.

1645
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:59,140
Seven.

1646
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:02,140
Logie, I can be biased because it's my song, so I'm giving it a ten.

1647
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:04,140
Alright, ten. Bradley.

1648
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,140
I'll give it a six.

1649
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:08,140
You give it a six. I give it a six and a half as well.

1650
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:10,140

1663
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:29,740
time because I can't. He likes, Gumby likes it when I give him a hard time. You know,

1664
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:37,060
wink wink, nudge nudge. Say no more. Alright, we'll be revealing those votes in a little

1665
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:43,800
bit. Moving right along though, we're going to talk about, oh our new web forums! Everybody

1668
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:58,680

1669
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:03,520
because they're free. They're not easyboard because I fucking hate easyboard and I wouldn't

02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:15,100

1673
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:19,120

don't also visit that web board oh yes please mention live journal community

1676
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:40,500
If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, all one word, that is where our live journal community is and go check it out. It's very orange.

1677
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,500
Yes, it's very orange. It's a very pretty design though. I must...

1678
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:46,500
Think, think. I'm on board for that. Not I can board for it.

1679
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,500
Live journal.

1680
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,500
Live journal for that. I just picked a default. It was orange.

1681
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,500
You just picked a default, Steve.

1682
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:55,820
And then, let's see, what else can we talk about?

1683
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:59,900
I wanted to talk about this really fast, if I can get this to bring up.

1684
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:03,860
What's being released, I believe this week, is a Good Cool compilation.

1685
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:07,980
Someone can get that for me for Christmas.

1686
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:14,340
I believe it's Good Cool Songs, and what they did, something about, Santa's redone all the

1687
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:16,940
songs in English.

1688
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:20,240
I don't know, at least the preview songs on the website, Santa's singing them and they're

1689
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,240
in English.

1690
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:28,240
But, we're going to get a quick clip of one of those songs for you right here.

1691
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,240
Let me see if I can get you one of these.

1692
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:33,240
Okay, we're going to hear a quick clip of one of these songs right here.

1693
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:38,240
I apologize if we do a dropout real fast, but I want to be able to play this clip for you guys, so here we go.

1694
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,240
I'm going to turn on the speaker so you guys in house can hear it.

1695
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:44,240
Let's see if it comes up. It's loading right now.

1696
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:50,240
I'm trying to get a clip of 19 November for the Good Cool album, which comes out on December 4th, so it comes out this week.

1697
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:55,240
comes out this week. Okay, here we go. Connecting, la la la la la. Let's try to connect to the

1698
02:09:55,240 --> 02:10:02,240
Here it goes. Here's a small clip of what this will sound like.

1699
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:29,240
I know you know everything but you know

1700
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:59,240
Come back, Brad. We love you.

1701
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:01,240
But we still hate Polteri.

1702
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:03,240
Why? Why Polteri? Why?

1703
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:05,240
Because Santa should not be singing in English.

1704
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:07,240
Hell, Santa should not be singing.

1705
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:11,240
She sings because she did a really nice song on the shining Polaris.

1706
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,240
Shining Polaris was good.

1707
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:16,240
Yeah. That's because LED kicks ass.

1708
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:20,240
They should fork out the money and get Utada Hikaru.

1709
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:22,240
Or Ayumi.

1710
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,240
Just fork out the money.

1711
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:34,240
What's awesome is, I don't know if anybody's played the Game Boy BeatMania games, I know that's pretty ghetto, but they've got some pretty cool licensed tracks on there. They do have a Youtuber song on there.

1712
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:42,240
I played the one on Wonderswan that has the digitized music. I played the BeatMania that was on Wonderswan. It was all digitized.

1713
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:47,240
Yeah, I have a Wonderswan color and the little turntable wouldn't fit on my thing very well.

1714
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:51,240
Well, Guitar Freaks has Depend On You.

1715
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:55,240
Depend On You, that's Ayumi Hamasaki, isn't it?

1716
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,240
It's not her singing.

1717
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:58,240
It's Ayumi, but it's not her singing.

1718
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,240
It's her song, but her singing.

1719
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,240
Just like, you know, Another World.

1720
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,240
It's not GAC'd!

1721
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:03,240
I can't believe it's not GAC'd.

1722
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:06,240
I can believe it's not GAC'd. It sounds like shit.

1723
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:10,240
Uh, so the Good Cool CD comes out December 4th.

1724
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:13,240
And somebody's required to give me that for Christmas.

Winter wins, they win.

02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,820
Hooray.

1739
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:12,220

Yes, please.

Because otherwise I'm going to have a cry.

1742
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,660
It is what it is.

1743
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:17,860
The only time is now.

02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:18,420
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been In the game, dream old, since the day of X-Men

1770
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:22,020
Way back when, I've been putting it down Ask how homie who's the baddest, but yo, who's got time?

1771
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:24,020
I float like a butterfly, sing like a meme

1772
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:27,520
Sectacular orbit in my city, that old promotion, never giving it less than the best

1773
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:29,520
Rock the ears in the game, that's your request

1774
02:18:29,520 --> 02:18:31,520
You like the rhymes, right, can't you dare?

1775
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:33,020
I kiss the vector so I don't care

1776
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:35,020
Why, that's me, seen the victim in me

1777
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:37,020
What a real in-scene is supposed to be

1778
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:40,520
Fucking you up, every time that I drop the fucking ruler, baby, I done took the spot

1779
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:44,520
I got the beat and the rock, rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

1780
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Higher than higher

1781
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:51,520
I'm gonna light the fire

1782
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:55,520
Higher than higher

1783
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:59,520
I'm gonna make you higher

1784
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,520
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

1785
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:09,520
Big ass bongo demands it!

1786
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:42,520
With over half the votes, out of three choices, over half the votes, the winner was...

1787
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:46,520
...Rider team, let's jump.

1788
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:50,520
David Hasselhoff is cool.

1789
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:53,520
David Hasselhoff was cool.

1790
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,520
Big difference, alright.

1791
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,520
Was cool.

1792
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,520
Actually, that's borderline cool.

1793
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,520
It was great in South Park.

1794
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:02,520
Thank you to everyone who voted, we appreciate it.

1795
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,520
Of course.

1796
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:10,520
Oh, I'm being given a link to the DDR Kids machine. Let's have a look-see-loo at this.

1797
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:17,520
A look-see-loo! Oh, my voice got a vote for the cage-backed winner.

1798
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:20,520
Thank you, Gumby.

1799
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,520
Actually, I think it was Twen that voted for that, but hey.

1800
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,520
Oh, there's a picture of the Dance of the Revolution Kids machine.

1801
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:25,520
I've seen them before.

1802
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,520
That's so cheesy!

1803
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,520
They were selling one on eBay.

1804
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:29,520
That's so cheesy.

1805
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:30,520
Remember? They were selling one on eBay.

1806
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:34,520
That's right, they were selling one. That's probably how the place got it.

1807
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,520
It looks like a what, Dave?

1808
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:42,520
A freaky sewing machine, kind of like Mickey Mouse.

1809
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:44,520
I thought you said a sewing machine.

1810
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:48,520
That's what I thought you said, Jeff. It looks like one of those picture maker things.

1811
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:54,520
Oh, very cute.

1812
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:58,520
Is there any other pictures? No, it just shows all the different kinds of DDR.

1813
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:02,520
All right. Well, whatever. Cool.

1814
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:06,520
Let's see. Oh, a deer.

1815
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:10,520
Top hits don't count. Top hits his ass.

1816
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:14,520
Okay. I'm afraid to look at this.

1817
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:18,520
Oh, that's cute. That's very cute.

1818
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:22,520
An Orange Lounge boy-on-boy mix. Signature. Beautiful.

1819
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:30,020

1820
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:38,520

1821
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:42,920

1822
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:46,920
OSB beats ended that stuff who sends this the shocking weird shit that really

1823
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:48,920
he is shocking and weird. That's twin.

1824
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:49,920
Yeah.

1825
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:50,920
Alright.

1826
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:53,920
So I think that we should move right along to our next game show.

1827
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:56,920
I think we should move right into our next game show.

1828
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:59,920
But we're going to first back this up with a story.

1829
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:01,920
I wanted to talk about this a little bit because it's the holidays.

1830
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:02,920
A story.

1831
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,920
A story.

1832
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,920
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1833
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,920
I gotta find this story.

1834
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:10,920
And I'm logged into the wrong account right now.

1835
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:11,920
I'm not gonna be able to pull up the story. Hold on.

1836
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:13,920
Jamie, tell a story about your day or something.

1837
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:15,920
I need time to fill here.

1838
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:27,920
laundry today, Rob. I washed my pants. A clean DDR is a fun DDR, and a happy DDR. Yeah.

1839
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:35,020
I played Kingdom Hearts, and then I played Max USA, and I don't know, it's so stupid

1840
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:38,180
how you have to play all these songs, because I've already done everything there is to do

1841
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:42,180
And I've got nothing left to do except try to unlock songs.

1842
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:45,180
And then, days lead over.

1843
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:48,180
Because they ended with getting hit in the head with a weasel.

1844
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:51,180
Well, no, he lit the menorah out too, right?

1845
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:53,180
I do that when I get back.

1846
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:55,180
Oh, you do that when you get back.

1847
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:56,180
Orange Lounge comes first.

1848
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:58,180
Orange Lounge always comes.

1849
02:22:58,180 --> 02:23:01,180
Orange Lounge is above all holy holidays.

1850
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:04,180
You've seen Rob Schneider as a gigolo.

1851
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:07,180
You've seen Rob Schneider as a woman.

1852
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:10,980
Now, see Rob Schneider as a stapler!

1853
02:23:12,980 --> 02:23:13,980
Oh, crap.

1854
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:21,980
I've been given some interesting stuff, and this is coming from Gumby, so you know this is going to be weird. Let's see.

1855
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:26,980
Gumby is sending me an article on...

1856
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:28,980
Good scene!

1857
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:33,980
It says it got size in the title, which sounds like, I don't know, it's not loading.

1858
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:41,780
Gumbi, thy link is broken, you suck, you lose.

1859
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:44,380
Maybe it's just because we're trying to broadcast a show and we can't see it right now.

1860
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:45,380
Let's see.

1861
02:23:45,380 --> 02:23:46,860
I'm just following random links that the chat room is sending me.

1862
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:48,860
This is scary.

1863
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:50,820
Oh, that's cute.

1864
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:51,820
That's very cute.

1865
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:56,180
Can you send me a picture of Counter-Strike where somebody's got little red octane dance

1866
02:23:56,180 --> 02:24:01,920
pads there and they give 100 health apparently, or they take 100 health more likely.

1867
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:06,920
They also take a hundred intelligence!

1868
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:08,920
Ah, kill me.

1869
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:14,920
Alright, let's see, I need to find this news article I was looking for, my bad.

1870
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:17,920
Brad, tell us about your day.

1871
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,920
I was over, you know, I was over here at 4 AM playing...

1872
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:24,920
Pretend you don't know and tell me again!

1873
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:25,920
Fuck you.

1874
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:28,920
Okay, I was over here at 4 AM playing your Animal Crossing.

1875
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:35,920
We left, we went to bed, we woke up at 1pm, yes we have lives, and we came over here and

1876
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:36,920
played more.

1877
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,920
Rob, how was your day?

1878
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,640
My day was fabulous, thank you for asking.

1879
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:43,640
Okay, I got the link up that I wanted, thank you.

1880
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:46,320
Oh yes, we're going to talk about, because the day-

1881
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,800
Rob got it up.

1882
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:48,800
Shut up.

1883
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,800
Shut up.

1884
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:50,800
And I'm the show too!

1885
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:51,800
You woman!

1886
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:52,800
Anyway.

1887
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,680
Uh, yeah, hello.

1888
02:24:54,680 --> 02:25:01,480
Go play your Grand Theft Auto woman mix in your Miata and your VW Bug.

1889
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:04,120
Bullshit, I'd have the terrain up.

1890
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:10,720
Anyway, we want to talk about the day after Thanksgiving is commonly known as the oh fuck

1891
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,160
stay away from the mall day.

1892
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:13,160
In other words...

1893
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:14,160
Black Friday.

1894
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,160
Black Friday, yes.

1895
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:16,160
Black Friday.

1896
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:20,560
The day when you do not want to be caught dead anywhere near a mall because it's that

1897
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,960
time of year to go shopping.

1898
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,960
I went to the mall.

1899
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:29,040
And of course, every year they release the list of the top holiday toys.

1900
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:34,000
So I thought they've compiled a list, this station WESH, I have no idea where they're

1901
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
located.

1902
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Sounds almost like...

1903
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
It doesn't matter.

1904
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,120
It doesn't matter where they're located.

1905
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:39,920
They're W, so they're east coast.

1906
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,480
They're somewhere east coast.

1907
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:44,240
They're stating it's a great time to start your Christmas shopping, you can beat the

1908
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:47,720
rush and the shelves are stocked, but what's going to be popular this year?

1909
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:51,680
You know how kids are in general, they don't care how much a toy costs or who makes it.

1910
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,160
They just want to have fun.

1911
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:54,160
So Yahoo!

1912
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,160
site for kids, Yahoo!

1913
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:59,000
Republicans, gave kids a chance to vote for toys on their wish list and these are the

1914
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,240
top five toys that kids are looking for for Christmas this year.

1915
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:11,120
The number five, this is amazing to me, the number five toy, Singing Stars Video Karaoke.

1916
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:13,240
It allows kids to become the next superstar.

1917
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:15,560
It's a hundred dollar karaoke machine.

1918
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:18,960
It's like American Idol except that you don't have to get bitched at.

1919
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:19,960
That should be the add-on.

1920
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:23,960
It's like, get the little British guy to bitch at you and yell and tell you that you're no good.

1921
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:27,960
The future generation of single, old people.

1922
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:28,960
Come over to my house, I'll bitch you.

1923
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:35,960
Drunken in a bar singing drunken music from times when they remember they were young.

1924
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:36,960
Yeah.

1925
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,960
You're gonna be high on pixie sticks.

1926
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:42,960
I weep for the future.

1927
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:46,960
Moving right along, the number four Christmas toy.

1928
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,960
The Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.

1929
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,960
I cry for America.

1930
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:55,960
Okay. The concept of this whole Yu-Gi-Oh thing is just shit.

1931
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:57,960
Let's make a show about a card game.

1932
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:00,960
Card games are cool. People just love watching card games.

1933
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,960
They don't like participating in card games.

1934
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,960
But watching them are really fun.

1935
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:08,960
Especially when little holographic things happen.

1936
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:12,960
No. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

1937
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,960
Not to mention this thing came out in 1991.

1938
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:15,960
Crap.

1939
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:26,160
and crap. Alright, so that was the number 4 holiday toy this year. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait,

1940
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:33,600
so, hold on. The Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game, are they talking about like a pack of 9 cards

1941
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:41,160
cost just under $9? That's what the website says. I believe everything I read online,

1942
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:46,080
so let's go to the next one let's go to the next one jamie why don't you tell us

1943
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:50,040

1944
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:58,840
oh you have a live journal get your kids online and teach them how to type so

1945
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:04,480

1946
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:09,200
password journal it's not password journal it's password journal 2 is the

1947
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:15,380
number three toy no it's the password journal to not 2d access just the

1948
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:19,080
password journal to the number two Christmas toy this holiday season for

1949
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:26,360
little Bratz is the Bratz funky fashion makeover it's a spin-off of the popular

1950
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:32,000
Bratz dolls and it cost $25 I don't even know what my mom would not let me get

1951
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,720
gem dolls because she thought that their heads were too big like crack babies

1952
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:38,720
These make the gem dolls look tame, okay?

1953
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:42,720
However, the boy ones are kind of cool.

1954
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:46,720
Was that like the drag Ken dolls, or what do they call it?

1955
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:50,720
Those gay Ken dolls? Or the drag ones? I don't know.

1956
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:54,720
You know there was actually a gay Ken doll?

1957
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:58,720
Yeah, I know.

1958
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:02,720
That totally sounds like something they'd sell in the Castro.

1959
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:11,240
He wore a ring, it was supposed to be like a medallion, a ring around his neck, on a

1960
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,240
chain.

1961
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,240
Ring around the cocky.

1962
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:16,160
And it was, and it was a cock ring.

1963
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,160
No.

1964
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:19,800
No, was it like magnum size, or?

1965
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:22,480
No, I didn't have one.

1966
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,480
Magnum size.

1967
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:24,480
Next!

1968
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:29,000
The number one toy this holiday season, Jamie, what is it?

1969
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
A Game Boy Advance.

1970
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Yes, that's right.

1971
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:34,720
If you have to ask what a Game Boy Advance is, then go back and bury your head back in

1972
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:35,720
the hole.

1973
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:40,440
Now, obviously, we here in the room disagree with this list completely, so we are going

1974
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:49,080
to give you, during this next List List segment, our top three video game related things we

1975
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:53,500
want for Christmas, or we think somebody should have for Christmas.

1976
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:58,280
So it's our top three video game, video gamer's Christmas list.

1977
02:29:58,280 --> 02:29:59,280
And we're going to do that.

1978
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:04,480
quick break so we can prepare our list and then we'll be right back. So listen to some

1979
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:07,880
music real fast. We're going to keep this really brief because we want to get this done

1980
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:17,040
before the show's over. So why don't you listen to something from 2DX8 style. How about our

1981
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:21,640
favorite band? Why? Because we took their name. Orange Lounge from 2DX8 style here on

1982
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:51,440
art Tonsins radio.

1983
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:25,440
So

1984
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:29,440
Do

1985
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:33,440
So

1986
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:37,440
Do

1987
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:41,440
So

1988
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:45,440
Do

1989
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:49,440
Do

1990
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:21,440
Oh

1991
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:42,800
All right, we are back.

1992
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:47,140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and now we're going to start a little thing we

1993
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:51,100
We call Listless here, and I'm trying to find our Listless music, although I don't know

1994
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:53,100
if I have it cued up.

1995
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:56,860
I might have to substitute a different game show theme because I can't find it.

1996
02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:57,860
I'll find it.

1997
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:58,860
Do you remember where I put it?

1998
02:33:58,860 --> 02:34:00,780
It's one of the old pre-show things.

1999
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:02,100
I have the pressure luck theme.

2000
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,100
Play that.

2001
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:04,100
Alright, we're going to play the pressure luck theme.

2002
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:05,100
Okay.

2003
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:06,100
Alright.

2004
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:14,100
Listless here, it's the top holiday toys that we want and you should want for Christmas.

2005
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:19,100
This is the way it works for those of you that haven't sat in on a list list segment before, because we have some new listeners tonight.

2006
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:26,100
We're going to give Olive Hour in the room our top three items, and then we're going to go around the room and take...

2007
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:32,100
Each of us will take one item off of the list. That's going to be hard, because we're going to be crushing someone's Christmas dream right there.

2008
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:35,100
It's going to be very difficult tonight, very painful.

2009
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:40,100
Yeah, we'll just eliminate all low-keys like we do every week.

2010
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:44,540
and then once that's done you guys will vote on the final list you'll take your

2011
02:34:44,540 --> 02:34:48,480
vote and you'll vote on what from that list is your most desired holiday toy

2012
02:34:48,480 --> 02:34:53,700
video game related it doesn't have to be new no just what you want this holiday

2013
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:59,620
season all right just what you want this holiday season and the thing that

2014
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:04,340
everybody should want this holiday season because you said so and you're gone okay

2015
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:06,660
got it

2016
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:13,660
all right and then uh... the chat room votes on the top three

2017
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:21,380
let's start

2018
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:25,380
number three

2019
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:30,380
I don't know why, I can't say this since I don't have a system anymore and I don't know why.

2020
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:37,380
I love the power glove. I'm so happy.

2021
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:44,380
Loki says everybody. Boys and girls everywhere need the Power Glove.

2022
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:51,380
Alright, let's move on. Brad, your number three choice.

2023
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:56,380
My number three choice is the PS1 with the combination with the LCD screen.

2024
02:35:56,380 --> 02:36:00,380
I want this, I don't have one yet, but I think I want everybody else to get one.

2025
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:03,380
So I can mod it for you, for a very special price of course.

2026
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:08,380
Alright, a PS1 and LCD screen. Very good choice. Dave.

2027
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:19,380
Oh, um, an ignition pad, because it's the only actual pad that you can play DVR on. Unless you've got like some crazy mod thing on it.

2028
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:29,380
Alright, an ignition pad says Dave. I'll go ahead and get my number three pick. My number three pick this holiday season will let Rob once. I want The Sims Online.

2029
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:37,380
Because if you think Animal Crossing is bad, just fucking wait until Sims Online. That's all I have to say.

2030
02:36:37,380 --> 02:36:39,380
Jamie, your number three pick.

2031
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:44,380
I want a PC Engine Duo RX. I have to explain this.

2032
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:45,380
Why?

2033
02:36:45,380 --> 02:36:50,380
I already own a TurboGrafx Duo. The PC Engine was what TurboGrafx was in Japan.

2034
02:36:50,380 --> 02:36:54,380
The advantage of having a duorax that has an arcade card built inside.

2035
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:59,380
I can actually play my copy of Strider, and, um, Art of...

2036
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:02,380
Not Art of Fighting 2, it's, uh, I think Real Boutville 3.

2037
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,380
That's fuckin' hardcore.

2038
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:05,380
No, it's Art of Fighting 2. It's Art of Fighting 2.

2039
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:07,380
Jamie, you're so hardcore.

2040
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,380
I can't help that one.

2041
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:12,380
And the other thing, I can play Sapphire.

2042
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:18,380
Sapphire is such a fabulous game because it's one of the first 16-bit games that had real polygons in it.

2043
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:24,380
The chat room is suggesting, by the way, things such as a mail-order bride should be on the list.

2044
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:28,380
You guys have to remember, we're talking video game-related things.

2045
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:34,380
Video game? Do you think a mail-order bride? Yeah, I guess if you play video games, that's the only way you're ever going to get married, is by ordering one.

2046
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:38,380
No, they can sit there and watch me play video games.

2047
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:42,380
Exceptions to every rule. Exceptions to every rule.

2048
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:45,380
I tease, I tease. Alright, moving on. Number two choice.

2049
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:49,380
My number two choice, I was going to go with now the uh,

2050
02:37:49,380 --> 02:37:53,380
I had some of the hidden cameras in the center square there, but

2051
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:57,380
I decided no, probably shouldn't do that because I'd have no use for them.

2052
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:01,380
I decided to go with the um, the official Konami

2053
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:05,380
Metal Stages, two of them.

2054
02:38:05,380 --> 02:38:09,380
Every boy and girl wants a Konami Metal Stage, moving right along

2055
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:13,380
Brad, go to your chips.

2056
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:21,380
A GameCube with Animal Crossing in it.

2057
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:33,380
If you need a reason that GameCube already has the Animal Crossing CD, you win.

2058
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:35,880
So he wants a GameCube with Animal Crossing in it.

2059
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:36,880
Alright.

2060
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:37,880
Okay.

2061
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,880
Fair enough.

2062
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:42,880
It didn't happen to me with a GameCube with an Animal Crossing in it.

2063
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:45,880
It happened with me with a Sega CDD and a Turtle Chain EX.

2064
02:38:49,380 --> 02:38:50,380
Hardcore.

2065
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:51,880
I mean, you bought it that way.

2066
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:53,880
Alright Dave, your number two choice.

2067
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:57,380
Um, my number two choice is a DD-REX machine.

2068
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:00,380
I'm sorry, a DD-REX machine?

2069
02:39:00,380 --> 02:39:01,380
Yes.

2070
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:02,880
What is that?

2071
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:03,880
uh...

2072
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,160
stream all my back

2073
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:09,040
well i don't know the legal yet upset i'm not down with it

2074
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,800
that i'm not doing that with the legal my bad

2075
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,720
you're right

2076
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:15,440
all right uh...

2077
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:16,920
by uh... never to pick

2078
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:19,360
for must-have this holiday season

2079
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:21,960
it's star on that

2080
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:25,440
and have to have the body

2081
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:29,960
as a gift

2082
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:32,400
jimmy your number to pick

2083
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:35,980
It was almost my number one pick, but I had to think of my priorities.

2084
02:39:35,980 --> 02:39:40,360
I want a BeatMania 2D X Arcade style controller.

2085
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:45,360
I had my chance to get one, I had the thing ordered, we had everything together.

2086
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:52,360
Your credit card's not the right kind, you can't accept it, so we're canceling your order.

2087
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:59,720
So it still has to do with it being a Japanese card, it has to have some type of association or something, so mine didn't have it.

2088
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:01,640
have it

2089
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:05,820

02:40:53,740 --> 02:40:57,820
you want to take it

2103
02:40:57,820 --> 02:41:00,820
If you say the 2DX machine, we're all set.

2104
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:03,820
Wait, actually, Loki said 2DX.

2105
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:08,820
Okay, you say 2DX, I say a JPS2 with 2DX in the controller.

2106
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:12,820
There we go.

2107
02:41:12,820 --> 02:41:14,820
Good lord, all right, fine.

2108
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:16,820
Throw in a memory card. Fair enough.

2109
02:41:16,820 --> 02:41:19,820
I think we have it all worked out now, geez.

2110
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:21,820
All right, my number one pick.

2111
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:24,820
Yes, I'm trendy, so what, fuck you.

2112
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:36,820
My number one pick, Yes I'm Trendy, Fuck You, Metroid Prime!

2113
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:46,820
I hate first person shooters and this game is fabulous.

2114
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:49,820
I love Respecial Cheers since I was five years old.

2115
02:42:16,820 --> 02:42:23,020
CD screen, Ignition Pad, The Sims Online, a PC Engine Duo RX, Konami Metal Stages, a

2116
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:28,060
GameCube and Animal Crossing, DDR EX, Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX arcade controller, Japanese

2117
02:42:28,060 --> 02:42:33,540
PS2, American PS2, a 2DX machine, Metroid Prime, and a drum mania controller and drum

2118
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:34,540
mania.

2119
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:35,540
Wow.

2120
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:40,300
I don't know how we're going to possibly do the elimination round, but, oh well, Christmases

2121
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:42,940
are about to be ruined here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2122
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:47,500
I don't know how people are expecting to pay for all this shit.

2123
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:49,980
Everything that I picked is in excess of $200.

2124
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:54,460
So I don't know, I guess you're going to vote for the thing you least would want to see

2125
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:55,460
under your tree.

2126
02:42:55,460 --> 02:43:00,780
I have no idea how you're going to make a selection here, but just fucking do it.

2127
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:03,900
Or your menorah, as the case may be.

2128
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:06,380
Okay, in the back in the peanut gallery, Neil's asking...

2129
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:14,380
You get eight days of presents, so you get your 2DX machine in pieces.

2130
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:17,380
Here's the monitor! Here's the key!

2131
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:21,380
Actually, I got fucking jibbed this Hanukkah. All I got was a DVR max.

2132
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:29,380
But, hopefully, because my birthday comes a day after Christmas, so normally they make up for it with the better shit on my birthday.

2133
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:32,380
Yeah, you got your priorities in order, you know.

2134
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:34,380
Good little Jewish boy.

2135
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:36,380
What the hell are you talking about?

2136
02:43:36,380 --> 02:43:39,380
Christmas and Hanukkah are all about presents.

2137
02:43:39,380 --> 02:43:42,380
Yeah, they're about presents.

2138
02:43:42,380 --> 02:43:45,380
They're about Jesus, or not.

2139
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:48,380
Anyway.

2140
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:51,380
Can we finish? Can we finish? Can we finish?

2141
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:56,380
Here we go. Loki, ruin someone's Christmas right now.

2142
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:58,380
What don't you want for Christmas?

2143
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:01,380
Well, since I don't play it at all.

2144
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:03,380
A 2DX machine.

2145
02:44:03,380 --> 02:44:06,580
2DX machine going straight for the gut

2146
02:44:09,620 --> 02:44:12,780
He's just gonna play when it's candy whenever it arrives all right Brad

2147
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:18,660
It's time for you to ruin Christmas and Hanukkah for somebody's for that man power gloves say goodbye

2148
02:44:18,660 --> 02:44:23,780
Oh, oh, no you didn't know you did not take on the power glove and it sucks

2149
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:27,020
Okay, the chat room

2150
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:33,660
The chat room will have your head for that Brad okay my turn Dave's turn metal stages metal stages

2151
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:36,060
Fuck you, Loki

2152
02:44:38,020 --> 02:44:40,460
Where the hell was that oh, yes the Konami metal stages there it is

2153
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:45,340
All right, I would purposely go out of stages come on

2154
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:51,700
Take off the jps2, but that was my number two choice if you I thought that oh never mind

2155
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:53,700
That was going to be one of my choices.

2156
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:56,700
My number one to come off the list, um...

2157
02:44:58,700 --> 02:45:00,700
Oh God, um...

2158
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:03,700
I'm gonna take off the PS1 LCD screen.

2159
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:05,700
Because...

2160
02:45:07,700 --> 02:45:11,700
I'm taking that off because the PS1 is so last year.

2161
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:17,700
You know what? I'm looking at this list, and I own probably most of the stuff that's on it already.

2162
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:19,700
Um, so...

2163
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:22,700
You don't own an EX machine.

2164
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:24,700
I said most of this stuff, not all of it.

2165
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:25,700
Alright, alright.

2166
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:29,700
Because I have a JPS2, an American PS2, a Metroid Prime, and a GameCube and Animal Crossing.

2167
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:30,700
And...

2168
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:31,700
Toot the little horn.

2169
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:34,700
I have... and I actually have a beta of Sims Online.

2170
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:35,700
So...

2171
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:39,700
Let's take off...

2172
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:40,700
No worries.

2173
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:45,700
Sorry Rob, we'll take off Sims Online.

2174
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:46,700
Oh, you suck.

2175
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:47,700
I hate you.

2176
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:48,700
Alright, I forgive you.

2177
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:49,700
Alright.

2178
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:50,700
I prefer not to be lagged.

2179
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:51,700
Thank you.

2180
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,940
Sims Online is off the list.

2181
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:56,900
So, the final list that now our chat room is going to vote for their number one.

2182
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:59,260
You only vote for one of these.

2183
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:02,300
Jamie, why don't you read off the final list here.

2184
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:06,020
Oh wait, I've got to make sure this copied right and not some porn site or something

2185
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:07,460
is going to post all over the chat room.

2186
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:09,900
I've got to make sure, you know, I can't pay for that to happen.

2187
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:10,900
Can't tag porn.

2188
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:13,260
Alright, why don't you read off this list, Jamie, and they can vote for it right now

2189
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:14,260
in the chat room.

2190
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:17,260
No, but pimp tricks are for hoes.

2191
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:20,580
We have an ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX.

2192
02:46:20,580 --> 02:46:21,580
How did that stay?

2193
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:25,460
Because it's the coolest video game system ever.

2194
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:29,020
You can play Dracula X on it, okay?

2195
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:33,900
GameCube with Animal Crossing, DDR Extreme, Phantasy Star Online, and of course you have

2196
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:38,740
to have the adapter with it, 2DX arcade style controller, it would help find connections.

2197
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:39,740
Sorry.

2198
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:44,260
Japanese PS2, American PS2, Metroid Prime, and Germania controller with Germania, because

2199
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:45,260
they came...

2200
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:46,260
What?

2201
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:51,260
Fabulous. So, a quick, quick music break while you guys send in your votes.

2202
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:53,260
You're only gonna have, like, two minutes to send me your votes.

2203
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:55,260
So do it now. Now, now, now!

2204
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,260
You can send them in over email as well, but hurry up and do it now.

2205
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:01,260
Vote for your favorite, and we will be right back.

2206
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:05,260
We're gonna play something from Guitar Freaks and DrumMania. What?

2207
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:08,260
The bump? I don't know if I have the bump cued up. I'm sorry.

2208
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:10,260
How about something from Guitar Freaks and DrumMania?

2209
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:11,260
Something there? Catch your eye?

2210
02:47:11,260 --> 02:47:12,260
Monkey Magic.

2211
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:13,260
Monkey Magic.

2212
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:15,260
And then we'll hear Kijaka.

2213
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:20,260
And then we'll come right back. So that gives you two minutes to vote here on Orange Line Radio.

2214
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:49,260
He knew every magic trick under the sun

2215
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:53,260
He'd forgotten everybody and had some fun

2216
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:57,260
Monkey magic, monkey magic

2217
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:01,260
Monkey magic, monkey magic

2218
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:09,260
Have a little bit of monkey magic

2219
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:13,260
Kiss you by your western eye

2220
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:20,260
There's a little little monkey in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky

2221
02:48:25,260 --> 02:48:29,260
One sunny day on the mountain top

2222
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:33,260
The monkey is the monkey that ever stopped

2223
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:37,260
He knew every last thing under the sun

2224
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:42,260
The Jesus gods and everyone had some fun

2225
02:48:42,260 --> 02:48:58,260
Monkey Magic

2226
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:49,260
The real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2227
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:52,980
You are listening to Orange Launch Radio. We're right in the middle of listless

2228
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:57,580
the topic tonight, the top thing we want most for Christmas

2229
02:50:57,580 --> 02:51:01,780
or Hanukkah, whatever you happen to celebrate. And if you were a little kid

2230
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:06,840
being sampled by the Hooligans website, the number one pick for them was a Game Boy Advance,

2231
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:09,780
which didn't even make our list.

2232
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:11,180
You know it's not going to be there.

2233
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:12,980
It means we probably already have one.

2234
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:15,060
Well, once again, these were the final choices.

2235
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:19,180
An ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX, a GameCube and Animal

2236
02:51:19,180 --> 02:51:23,500
Crossing, a DDR Extreme machine, which is a miracle,

2237
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:25,380
because it's not even out till next year.

2238
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:29,060
But I'm just going to assume you're talking about a beta.

2239
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:34,100
Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX controller arcade style,

2240
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:37,800
Japanese PS2 and American PS2, Metroid Prime,

2241
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:40,920
and a drum mania controller and drum mania.

2242
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,200
I just want to say it's the holidays.

2243
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:45,160
Miracles happen this time around, you know?

2244
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:46,560
Miracles do happen.

2245
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:47,120
Thank you.

2246
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:49,840
Thank you, Preachy Dave.

2247
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:51,840
We appreciate that.

2248
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,040
OK.

2249
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:56,920
Let's read the top ones.

2250
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:59,200
I was trying to find a sound effect file,

2251
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:07,760
but I don't have one, so let's do this one.

2252
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:10,760
Okay, the winners are...

2253
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:14,760
Boy Ren, if you think you're happy now, wait till you hear this!

2254
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:17,760
It's a record of my favorite song!

2255
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:20,760
Yes, you get the Happy Happy Joy Joy song.

2256
02:52:20,760 --> 02:52:23,760
Happy Happy Joy Joy!

2257
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:29,760
Hello, boys and girls.

2258
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:32,760
This is your old pal, Stinky Whizzledee.

2259
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:35,760
The number three winner, Happy Happy Joy Joy,

2260
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:39,760
This is a GameCube and Animal Crossing!

2261
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:43,760
Yay! GameCube and Animal Crossing win.

2262
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:47,760
Third place, second place winner is

2263
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:51,760
a Judy X arcade style controller.

2264
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:55,760
Why wouldn't he just want the rather

2265
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:59,760
if Loki hadn't put it off.

2266
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:03,760
Hey, that's the way it works.

2267
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:14,760
And the winner of Buy a Landslide might I add, I don't know why, because it ain't even out yet, but hey, nobody gave the chat room points for being smurt.

2268
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:24,760
Just kidding. We love our chatters, and they did pick a DDR Extreme machine as the number one must-have holiday present thing.

2269
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:27,760
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy!

2270
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:30,760
If we knew it, the granddaddy of all luck

2271
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:04,760
the game did not garner enough... It doesn't count because it wasn't on our list. Sheesh.

2272
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:10,480
Yeah. Deal with it. We'll do another list list for my voice later. Every day is a game

2273
02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:16,800
with Rob. Oh, they're saying that Sky's voice the game would be like Parappa the game. Kick

2274
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:22,840
punch, it's all in the mind. Or something, like my... In the rain or in the snow, I got

2275
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:28,720
the funky flow. That means he has to pee. He got the funky flow from eating too much

2276
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:35,360
beans. Oh, dear good lord. Alright, it's about time to end the show. Believe it or not, we've

2277
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:40,600
made it for three hours. Oh, shit, we gotta do Loki's sim update. My bad. My bad. Way

2278
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:44,360
to go there, Rob. Ah, shit, I thought we could get through one show without it. No, I'm kidding,

2279
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:47,520
I'm kidding. Yes, give us your sim update, Loki. Make it quick. Alright. Not too much

2280
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:52,200
going on. We've got DWI, new version now, I believe they're up at the like 3-2 or something.

2281
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:55,520
Oh, who cares, it doesn't really matter. The whole point is that they have...

2282
02:54:55,520 --> 02:55:01,720
Karaoke now is the lyrics from 3rd Mix you were talking about earlier. That is now featured

2283
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:06,520
in DWI. Oh shit. And so people are actually, you know, making lyrics for songs and that

2284
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:11,440
wonderful stuff. And also they have the addition for special characters, you know, like the

2285
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:16,720
hearts and Japanese characters and stuff. They have that available now free. So go check

2286
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:28,720
Also, for all you Bimani Ruler DWI fans out there, on DDR Mania X, you'll probably see a post in the user-submitted files saying something about a share DWI.

2287
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:39,720
Well, guess what? That's not share, that is the return, the last final Bimani Ruler unreleased track that you need to go download, because it's supposed to be good, but I tried it and it's just four-key beatmania.

2288
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:41,720
But anyways, have fun with that.

2289
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:47,720
So yeah, also, Turning Mix 3 is going to be, you know, enter that if you haven't yet.

2290
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:49,720
And it'll be fun.

2291
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:51,720
They should be posting up files probably at the end of December.

2292
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:54,720
How about Make Edit, Get Porn? Give us an update on Make Edit, Get Porn.

2293
02:55:54,720 --> 02:55:57,720
Well, I haven't really kind of come up with a date yet.

2294
02:55:57,720 --> 02:56:00,720
I'm wondering more stuff to go in the boxes.

2295
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:03,720
So yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on there.

2296
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:07,720
So I'll announce a date when we do have one.

2297
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:14,720
Aside from that, really not too much going on. Just check out DDRUK. Do donate the money because they're kind of short on money.

2298
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:21,720
But they do have the Dancing Stage, Party Edition files up, and also pretty much almost everything else official-wise.

2299
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:24,720
So go check it out. They have sync sets for you to download.

2300
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:26,720
So, yeah. That's it.

2301
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:28,720
Oh! Oh! Oh! And one more thing.

2302
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:36,720
Now, it's my understanding, and I'm not really sure about the Naoki Journal because I can't read Japanese, but I believe that this is the last one.

2303
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:41,000
well I cry yeah next

2304
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:46,440
that Jamie oh yeah I guess it's time that time to give our final thoughts

2305
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:47,420
tonight Jamie

2306
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:51,780
and just one little thing I got BMX triple x for free

2307
02:56:51,780 --> 02:56:56,020
and it sucks but you can pick up the whole integrity or pimp

2308
02:56:56,020 --> 02:57:00,260
but that's all and for that it's worth buying

2309
02:57:00,260 --> 02:57:04,420
no you're getting it for free low key your final thought please

2310
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:13,420
If you get sci-fi, tomorrow night at 9 p.m. is the first of ten two-hour-long mini-movies of Taken.

2311
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:23,420
It's one of the most awesome series. It's produced by C.N. Spielberg, directed by ten different people. It's going to be really awesome. Definitely check it out.

2312
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:26,420
Alright, we'll duel just for you, Loki.

2313
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:29,420
Okay, um, I just found my Koosh thing.

2314
02:57:29,420 --> 02:57:30,420
Dave, yes, you're fine alone.

2315
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:41,420
Yeah, I've had it, like, I brought it over here, I think, two months ago, and left it here, and I was wondering where it was, and then, hey, that guy, I figured his name was playing with it.

2316
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:42,420
No, that guy.

2317
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:43,420
That guy Brad?

2318
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:44,420
No.

2319
02:57:44,420 --> 02:57:46,420
That guy Brad, or that guy, uh, Neil?

2320
02:57:46,420 --> 02:57:47,420
Yeah.

2321
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:48,420
Yes.

2322
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:49,420
Yeah, him.

2323
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:50,420
Yeah, all right.

2324
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:54,420
People in my house that don't participate in Orange Lounge because they don't get the DDR thing.

2329
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:22,980
Bradley, your final thought, please.

2330
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:26,980
That thing is a copy of an Aerobee that I used to have on those things.

2331
02:58:26,980 --> 02:58:27,980
An Aerobee.

2332
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:29,980
It's like harder than that.

2333
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:32,980
Especially the thing that you throw the farthest.

2334
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:35,980
Yeah, because now toys are supposed to be non-lethal.

2335
02:58:35,980 --> 02:58:36,980
Yeah.

2336
02:58:36,980 --> 02:58:42,980
Well, anyway, now that the show is over, the streets are now, once again, safe for Balani.

2337
02:58:42,980 --> 02:58:45,980
Hooray.

2338
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:48,260
Whoa, to the Republic.

2339
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:52,820
My final thought is that my voice is not high and funny, it is deep and sexy.

2340
02:58:52,820 --> 02:58:55,240
It's high in fiber.

2341
02:58:55,240 --> 02:58:56,240
And I need to get...

2342
02:58:56,240 --> 02:58:58,460
Rob's voice is high in fiber and fortified with vitamins.

2343
02:58:58,460 --> 02:58:59,780
And I need to get laid.

2344
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:00,780
And that's it.

2345
02:59:00,780 --> 02:59:01,780
Whale!

2346
02:59:01,780 --> 02:59:02,780
Wasn't that special?

2347
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:04,980
I really, really, really need to get laid.

2348
02:59:04,980 --> 02:59:05,980
That's it.

2349
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:06,980
Good night.

2350
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:07,980

Remember, we're pre-taped next week.

2352
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:12,540
If you missed the message earlier in the show, we'll be doing it live on Saturday, but for

2353
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:16,900
For those who can't join us Saturday, we'll be rebroadcasting at the normal time on Sunday,

2354
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:21,580

2364
02:59:59,060 --> 03:00:02,060
This is the triforce of wisdom, Link.

It's evil wizard Ganon has the triforce of power.

2366

Who ever gets both triforces will lose his last effort, so you must help me, Link!

2367
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:17,060
