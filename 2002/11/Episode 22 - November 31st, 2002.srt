1
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:03,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:04,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:08,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,373
[SPEAKER_18]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Mamani Talk, and then some.

6
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

8
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:29,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

9
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

10
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:33,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

11
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:35,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

12
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:43,036
[SPEAKER_15]: In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?

13
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:46,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

14
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,758
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite scary?

15
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:49,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Showgirls.

16
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:51,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolute fright.

17
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:52,793
[SPEAKER_20]: What's yours?

18
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,513
[SPEAKER_20]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

19
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't torture yourself.

20
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:58,314
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my job.

21
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:00,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

22
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:04,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

23
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:11,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

26
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:15,298
[SPEAKER_16]: No one expects a punishing position.

27
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:16,418
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gender.

28
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:16,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

29
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:26,089
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio, and this is episode number 22 for December the 1st of 2002 at

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a nut.

31
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:02,498
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

32
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:33,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Also tonight with us in studio, say hello to Brad, Yankee style.

33
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,129
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not to taste good.

34
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to go play animal.

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And the happy little panda rice princess, say hello to Irene.

36
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm going to go play animal.

37
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Addicts.

38
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:46,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all addicts.

39
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,010
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking to them more.

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do listless tonight, so they'll be back for listless a little later in the show.

41
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:55,060
[SPEAKER_03]: First, we're going to take a really quick break, feature you some requests.

42
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can eat more nuts.

43
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:59,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to eat more nuts, and we'll be right back to talk about all things Bomani.

44
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some.

45
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: See you then.

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

47
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,275
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a boring story.

48
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a girlfriend right now.

49
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

50
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:37,624
Thank you!

51
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:57,336
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

52
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:58,076
Orange Lounge Radio.

53
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, we are back live.

54
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

55
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:27,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave's in the house.

56
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:27,583
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

57
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: He's color coordinated.

58
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

59
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wear blue now.

60
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,006
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I wear.

61
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so coordinated today.

62
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Hanukkah to you, Dave.

63
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got Max USA.

64
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, by the way, is also our resident Jew.

65
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

66
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to love the Jewish people, though.

67
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never met a mean Jewish person.

68
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Jewish person I've ever met has been completely nice.

69
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, kind of borderline, but good enough.

70
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: My grandmother.

71
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do like this color coordination thing you have going on.

72
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

73
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:06,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were just playing that promo, the catch-up song promo, and I was thinking, Dave's the only person I know that actually knows the dance.

74
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish I'd known the other night when they were playing it at the club.

75
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the dance.

76
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the five-second video of them doing, like, the, I don't know, the chimichanga dance or whatever it's called.

77
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: The cucaracha dance.

78
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:19,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that.

79
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,531
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where you lay on your back and wave your hands and the feet in the air like a dead cockroach.

80
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:26,334
[SPEAKER_11]: The cucaracha.

81
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:31,415
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but the reason why I'm late is because... Are we just being totally random tonight?

82
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you tardy, sir?

83
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:37,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I figured you're just getting used to the 6.30 thing, because this is only, like, what, the third show we've been starting at 6.30?

84
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:52,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I remembered at about 4 o'clock, I'm like, okay, well, I just borrowed Kingdom Hearts from my friend JJ, so I think I'll go play the Hades Cup now, which is 50 battles long, including at least five bosses.

85
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:56,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started that, I'm not exactly sure when, because I had to level up a little bit,

86
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:02,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I finally finished, I beat everyone, and I finished like 10 minutes ago.

87
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I ran down and came over here.

88
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:09,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I suppose if we're going to get cast aside for Kingdom Hearts, there's not a lot we can do.

89
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:10,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Animal Crossing stole me from Kingdom Hearts.

90
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:11,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

91
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:16,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crossing, by the way, is in the other room right now, and that's where Brad and Irene, they just came in in the beginning to say hello, and now they're back out there.

92
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:21,655
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be back for listless later on the show, but... I'm going to have to start playing Kingdom Hearts again because I'm only at Agrabah.

93
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:24,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm way over-leveled for where I am.

94
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:32,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Being suggested in the chat room, apparently EOSFEB has this bookmarked, the link to the catch-up song video.

95
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he sure was able to find that pretty fast.

96
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:38,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wants us to watch that live on air, but unfortunately I can't do that.

97
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to vomit on the microphone.

98
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't want to get Jamie to vomit on the microphone.

99
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:48,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if I try to watch streaming video, it eats up a lot of my resources, which means listeners get kicked from the live stream, and we don't want that to happen.

100
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:50,158
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll do that another time.

101
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he wants to thank whoever made that video, so I'm assuming there's a lot of cleavage and boob shots.

102
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:57,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleavage.

103
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:00,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

104
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's hear it for tits.

105
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

106
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,602
[SPEAKER_11]: As I say it, I'm a flat monotone.

107
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we apologize also if you're hearing a hum in the background tonight.

108
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:16,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what's causing it.

109
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:24,958
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying in studio here to take measures to not have it happen, but it's still happening, we think, so just bear with us tonight, please.

110
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:25,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

111
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pretend we're all doing yoga.

112
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:35,504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the incessant noise of Homer after he's like, Mmm, donut.

113
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:35,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Beer.

114
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,986
[SPEAKER_04]: 72-ounce tub of beer.

115
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they sell these huge, huge, big old things at 7-Eleven now.

116
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like, gotta be like 114 ounces.

117
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:46,840
[SPEAKER_03]: The buckets.

118
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,781
[SPEAKER_03]: The super buckets.

119
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't see the bucket that I bought Dan at Great America.

120
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

121
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,267
[SPEAKER_11]: We were there to see Margaret Cho.

122
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:57,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought this 100 and something ounce bucket.

123
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:58,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Drink bucket.

124
00:12:59,373 --> 00:12:59,714
[SPEAKER_11]: For Dan.

125
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I do remember seeing that.

126
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was for his coffee.

127
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:06,810
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just for him to drink.

128
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,691
[SPEAKER_10]: For orange soda.

129
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the 7-Eleven's having a special right now.

130
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:13,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fill up any mug for 79 cents full of coffee.

131
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:15,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'll do that.

132
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring that thing and fill it up full of coffee and take it to work.

133
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,842
[SPEAKER_03]: You should make your ghetto mochas.

134
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I did my ghetto mocha's own.

135
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:23,187
[SPEAKER_11]: The ghetto mocha...

136
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:29,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You take really strong coffee, and then you put in Swiss Mist chocolate mix.

137
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:37,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Add in a tablespoon of hazelnut creamer, and then like half a spoonful of sugar.

138
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:41,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Mix that up, add more coffee to mix everything else up, and then drink it.

139
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,240
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll be awake all day for the next week.

140
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're going to go get sucked in Animal Crossing 2 as well.

141
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:51,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard so much about it, how can I resist?

142
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:52,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

143
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:56,023
[SPEAKER_11]: fine, fine you didn't even eat my nuts

144
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now Bradley's here.

145
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang, is there a party going on at the house today that I don't know about, apparently?

146
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's say hello to Bradley.

147
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,143
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Bradley?

148
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:07,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing okay.

149
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:09,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You just ran over here.

150
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,325
[SPEAKER_03]: You were in the chat room, the exit, and now here you are.

151
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you came to finally get your 2DX controller this week, right?

152
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

153
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:15,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless I forget again.

154
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:16,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come back again.

155
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I haven't played it at all.

156
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously, we have Animal Crossing now, so we got sucked into that.

157
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:27,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's no use for my PlayStation anymore, because, you know, we've got Animal Crossing.

158
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:30,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw Bomani, this is now a show all about Animal Crossing.

159
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:32,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that Mallory.

160
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the I hate Mallory show.

161
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Mallory.

162
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, just kidding.

163
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:37,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Mallory gives me stuff.

164
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:41,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you hear that Olivia is the troublemaker in our town, who moved from your town.

165
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want Olivia back.

166
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:44,866
[SPEAKER_10]: You're abusing Olivia.

167
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:49,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I do have to say also though, of course, a big, big thank you to Loki.

168
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

169
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: But Loki spent a little money to get a GameCube and an Animal Crossing for the house.

170
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: We deeply appreciate it, so thank you very much.

171
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,840
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

172
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

173
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:26,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start the show off tonight by visiting the old mailbag.

174
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:36,108
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And so right now we're going to open up the mailbag and take a look.

175
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've got some mail this week.

176
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:38,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We...

177
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, going into the mailbag.

178
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,269
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLawnTrailYahoo.com Oh, look!

179
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:44,570
[SPEAKER_03]: One new message!

180
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's one more email than we had last week.

181
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:50,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I feel so special.

182
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

183
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:53,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Crack!

184
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:25,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Also known as Propel.

185
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel?

186
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:27,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on Propel.

187
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:28,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what are you on?

188
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:30,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on anything.

189
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like this.

190
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:36,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high on life.

192
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I prefer Happy Crack.

193
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:39,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on God.

194
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

195
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, not that there's anything wrong with that.

196
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If all goes well later, I'll be on a stranger's bed.

197
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:54,444
[SPEAKER_03]: No, uh, just kidding, just kidding.

198
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be enough boy porn.

199
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:05,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number two, Martin wants to know, no, it's all about man porn.

200
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:06,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a boy, I'm a man.

201
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:11,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, question number two for Martin, can he have some?

202
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:13,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, go to Walgreens.

203
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Walgreens and get some Propel.

204
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:17,441
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

205
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:21,148
[SPEAKER_05]: As we discussed, I'm not on anything, so to have... No.

206
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,916
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.

207
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have any of me.

208
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too good for you.

209
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Too good for you.

210
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, you can't have any of my life.

211
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:35,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably get some man porn if you go down to your local video store.

212
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, are you running out of time?

213
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need a time transplant?

214
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:39,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

215
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go back to high school.

216
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed out on so much.

217
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:45,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you know what?

218
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:46,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin, if you send us your address...

219
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,882
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

220
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,359
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd almost think we're a real radio station or something.

221
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, give us your address, we'll send you flavored water.

222
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Next!

223
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we didn't say what it was going to be, flavored ass.

224
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm, pea-flavored propel, yuck.

225
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:32,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Mmm, urination, the best nation in the world.

226
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You're disgusting.

227
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, question number three.

228
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:42,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does the chat room not work on my fucking computer?

229
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Send us your fucking computer stats.

230
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me guess, you're using a Mac.

231
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:48,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing.

232
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:51,987
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be using a Mac.

233
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a little difficult, and you might get confused with a toaster.

234
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's how you can tell.

235
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put toast in it?

236
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:00,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it make bagels?

237
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,141
[SPEAKER_05]: If it does those two things, that's kind of difficult.

238
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:10,822
[SPEAKER_05]: You might need to actually get a computer expert to determine whether it's a toaster or a Mac.

239
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So, good luck there.

240
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I only said that to piss off Black Lab, because I know he's listening right now.

241
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,663
[SPEAKER_11]: We love you, Black Lab.

242
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:18,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, Black Lab.

243
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

244
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:26,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Lab, by the way, is a big Mac fan, so we occasionally knock on the Macs to piss him off.

245
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And if actually Shark's girl's listening, she's a Mac whore, too.

246
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:30,906
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a Mac-ette.

247
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,530
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing I can suggest is use the Java chat room.

248
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:50,593
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and then you're going to just click on the chat page.

249
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:55,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the very bottom it'll say, if all these steps don't work, try our Java applet.

250
00:19:55,916 --> 00:20:00,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to give thanks to Twen because he helped us get this Java applet working.

251
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:02,866
[SPEAKER_03]: This handy little thing.

252
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:04,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And that should work.

253
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: If your computer can view complex websites, you can run Java.

254
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,055
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get into chat through that method.

255
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck.

256
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope to see you in the chat room tonight.

257
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number four from Martin.

258
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,781
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going through the email in our email bag at OrangeLionRadioYahoo.com right now.

259
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:22,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number four is, how the hell did you know so much about the money?

260
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:29,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you asked because this is the part where we get to inflate our egos a little bit talking about how old school we are, Jamie.

261
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:32,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Gee, don't start on me or anything.

262
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to go new schoolist to old schoolist?

263
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:36,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I can start.

264
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:39,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jamie's the most old school in the room.

265
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, um, let's see.

266
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Not last year, year before.

267
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:49,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I first played on the DDR machine at AX2000, I think it was.

268
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Bradley was there, that's where I met Bradley.

269
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: On the May Expo 2000.

270
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:57,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I started playing in February of that year.

271
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I had seen DDR the year before that.

272
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:06,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in a Best of Move tournament, Best of Move 2, just trashing everybody until I got a faulty controller.

273
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,103
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was in...

274
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:15,465
[SPEAKER_11]: July of 1999 that I first saw DDR and I looked over and thought, that game looks stupid.

275
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:22,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Until I heard someone playing, um, uh, what was that bus stop song?

276
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:22,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Kung Fu Fighting.

277
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:25,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, hey, it's Kung Fu Fighting, that's pretty cool.

278
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I went over and looked at it and I'm like, oh.

279
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:33,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I played DDR for the first time in February and my friend loaned me his PlayStation version and a dance pad.

280
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Really crappy, they were probably one too, but I digress.

281
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:37,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

282
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:50,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I was like, this DDR thing is cool, and then I came home from work one day in April, my birthday, and there was our Dreamcast set out with one of the nice dance pads and my own DDR second mix.

283
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was happy, and I first played the machine, and, uh...

284
00:21:55,541 --> 00:22:07,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember being in there, seeing Xanadu, because I liked the movie, and I liked Olivia Newton-John.

285
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:09,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And people would go, I thought you'd never played DDR before?

286
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,009
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I like, this was a movie?

287
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you know, Olivia Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra, are you that young?

288
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

289
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:20,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how it went from there.

290
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,066
[SPEAKER_11]: September-ish.

291
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,608
[SPEAKER_11]: No, maybe August or so.

292
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:28,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Euclid Lane's got their DDR 1.5 and that started it.

293
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:30,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

294
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:35,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and just you've become such an addict over time that that's how you know so much about my money.

295
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:38,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just kept finding more and more stuff that I liked.

296
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

297
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: My story, I'll try to keep it brief.

298
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:41,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's one other thing.

299
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:42,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

300
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:46,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I have this, you know, addiction to owning controllers.

301
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:47,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

302
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:51,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, we need my money again, I have to have a good controller for it!

303
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:54,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And, yeah, anyway, okay, go ahead.

304
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, but it was Memorial Day some year.

305
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:12,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and I actually went to Milpitas Golf Land.

306
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they were having a tournament because there were a lot of people there.

307
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:18,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Now keep in mind, I knew nothing about, we were actually going there to golf.

308
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew nothing about DDR or anything.

309
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:20,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the game, thought it was cool.

310
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:25,286
[SPEAKER_03]: No chance in hell I was going to be playing because there was way too crowded around the machine.

311
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:34,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually ended up seeing the machine months later at a 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention in October of 2000, and that's when I played for the first time.

312
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:39,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple friends from the Rocky cast, including Rice Princess, was out in the other room.

313
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:46,698
[SPEAKER_03]: We skipped out on the convention Friday night, and we stayed up and played DDR, and it was so much fun.

314
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when I got hooked on DDR.

315
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:58,108
[SPEAKER_03]: and after that, let's see, I started playing when Roseville Golfland got USA Mix in something like, what, January?

316
00:23:58,989 --> 00:23:59,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

317
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started playing, no, it was December, December of two years ago.

318
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I met you at Milpitas Golfland.

319
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's coming up, yeah, it's coming up two years.

320
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So two years I've been playing Mamani and I just, what can I say, I'm addicted.

321
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I'm a sponge.

322
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I pick up every piece of information I hear online.

323
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:22,609
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the radio thing goes, I used to have my own college radio show for seven semesters back when I went to Chico State, so that's kind of where I picked up the radio thing.

324
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:36,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was co-hosting a program called Understation Live up until a couple months ago when our head host, Travis, had to leave, took off for Texas, and just kind of been doing the radio thing ever since.

325
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:42,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge is, I guess at its core, Orange Lounge is somewhat of a spin-off of that show, but...

326
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:43,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

327
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:44,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you want to call it.

328
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your turn.

329
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the most new school, and this is kind of sad, because I know you've been playing DDR at least a year, so that doesn't make you that new school.

330
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually been like two years.

331
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

332
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It started, I think it was, let's see.

333
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw you there.

334
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:02,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew I saw you in front of me.

335
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:03,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dressed up as Emmy.

336
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:04,449
[SPEAKER_05]: How would I remember?

337
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:04,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

338
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:05,769
[SPEAKER_05]: He was drunk.

339
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:28,445
[SPEAKER_02]: He was trying to get hookers.

340
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to get hookers.

341
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:30,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

342
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you tuned into last week or the week before that, you would have already known that that's happened.

343
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:38,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sorta.

344
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,769
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he was chasing the Jiggly slut around.

345
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Jiggly slut?

346
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,370
[SPEAKER_11]: The Jigglypuff cosplay girl.

347
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,091
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they...

348
00:25:44,955 --> 00:25:53,463
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I remember, well, no, last year, last year we were chasing around a bunch of women with cameras, but, uh, no.

349
00:25:53,683 --> 00:26:01,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so I saw a DDR4th mix there, and then I got to try a USA Machine in Tahoe and had no rhythm whatsoever, so that was fun.

350
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:03,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, so then I went and

351
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I found out that it was at, you know, Sunsplash, or RPGL, and so I went and played down there, you know, ever since the other fourth in their USA machine.

352
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, bought the home versions and that kind of thing.

353
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:24,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And then ever since that, because I used to be really into Cusar, and, you know, the laser tech place up here, and I played it for like four years and was really obsessed with it.

354
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:27,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then that went away, and so now...

355
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:47,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I guess I'm just new in the DDR, and how I know a lot of stuff about Bomani is that at my work, during phone calls and stuff, I'm actually browsing the Bomani news sites out there, and that's how I know pretty much everything that goes on, because I read about, I'd say about 12 different message boards all day long.

356
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:52,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, so that's the answer to that question.

357
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:56,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, that was a long question, that was a long answer, but hey, we've got a lot to say here on Orange Lounge Radio.

358
00:26:56,628 --> 00:27:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just joining us, as I know some people have just joined us, we are answering email right now.

359
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,013
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a question, a comment, something you'd like to say, we will read it in our mailbag segment.

360
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send us an email, orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.

361
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're reading an email from Martin right now, and he asked a bunch of questions, so we're answering them right now.

362
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:19,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number five, is it only me or do the Zippers suck?

363
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:26,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The Zippers, by the way, being that band that JB brought in last night, or I'm sorry, last week with the CD.

364
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:30,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a huge fan of the Zippers.

365
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:33,339
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I don't like them pretty much at all.

366
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, they kind of suck if you don't like that speed type music thing.

367
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:43,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's kind of a trend that DDR has, you know, putting a lot of speed mixes and Euro mixes, stuff, stuff.

368
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:48,487
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're just not into it, I guess then you wouldn't like it, but, you know, it's something for someone, I'm sure.

369
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:49,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Like JV.

370
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,998
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely need to flush that song

371
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:08,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So, your opinion of the zippers, Jamie?

372
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:13,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Our apologies to JB, and we hope you still love us.

373
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Waka Laka School.

374
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

375
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,843
[SPEAKER_03]: How come everyone I know suddenly has the weasel, a.k.a.

376
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:24,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Bush Baby?

377
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:26,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Bush Baby...

378
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Our second Orange Lounge mascot.

379
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first Orange Lounge mascot would be Dave.

380
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But our second Orange Lounge mascot would be the weasel.

381
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It was given to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.

382
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:37,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple as that.

383
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sits here.

384
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of little thingies that sit above the computer.

385
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,990
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Clifford ball.

386
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a devil I got from that same convention where I saw DDR the first time.

387
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:48,653
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple Bats Maru.

388
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:49,374
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of stickers.

389
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Cartman doll.

390
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.

391
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:55,318
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferret was just sitting up there and Jamie grabbed it one night and just went to town.

392
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:56,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So you hear it right now.

393
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's the story behind the weasel.

394
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And if everyone you know has the weasel, I don't know your friends, so I don't know why.

395
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:07,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the weasel a ferret?

396
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:08,084
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a thingy.

397
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:09,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

398
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,426
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you find out about DDR top hits or mishits?

399
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I signed on to Sackbay Money one day and there it was.

400
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:16,367
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

401
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:18,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki told me, so I'll let him tell him.

402
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually Aaron in Japan.

403
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,428
[SPEAKER_05]: They were on their message boards.

404
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: They were doing a kind of like Demonte knockoffs and spinoffs and that kind of thing.

405
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happened to be the first one they were talking about was DJR Top Hits.

406
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:33,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Same group did another one.

407
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:36,419
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a solo upgrade to Fifth Mix.

408
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the same people that did that one, did this one.

409
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, AaronInJapan.com.

410
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:45,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fine website.

411
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:45,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We like them.

412
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:46,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So go visit them.

413
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question, did I get your email address right?

414
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course you did, because we're reading your email right now.

415
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:57,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It is OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word, at Yahoo.com, and says, Loki, email me back if you did.

416
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:02,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll forward this email to Loki, and you two can talk about whatever you guys need to talk about.

417
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:02,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

418
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:06,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, maybe he wants a date.

419
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:08,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

420
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,272
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so thanks so much for the email, Marvin.

421
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

422
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:13,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he just joined the chat room.

423
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:17,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a new name here that matches the one on the email, so who knows?

424
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we just got one more new message.

425
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have a look.

426
00:30:21,397 --> 00:30:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we got an email from Black Lab.

427
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:25,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's his FUs of the week.

428
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got to save those for later.

429
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:26,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

430
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll read those later.

431
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the FUs of the week.

432
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:36,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to try to make it out there, but I don't know how possible it is with my work.

433
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a little ways to go.

434
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he says, he says, yes, it is him.

435
00:30:54,571 --> 00:31:01,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, another early happy birthday wish to one of our, we have a new school listener and a very, very old school listener.

436
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Been here with us, I believe, since the first show.

437
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:04,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Did our website.

438
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,493
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCal Kicks is having a birthday tomorrow.

439
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:08,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So, happy birthday to him.

440
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:09,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Squeak.

441
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:11,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can turn off the music now.

442
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done with the mailbag.

443
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:15,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a big happy birthday.

444
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I have the sound off in the studio to try to get rid of that hum.

445
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:20,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

446
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,135
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

447
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:29,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So, speaking of SoCalKicks, I believe I can talk about this now.

448
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:29,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

449
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see.

450
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:31,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to plug some websites.

451
00:31:31,886 --> 00:31:37,232
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some website hunting right now because a couple of websites have just launched.

452
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:38,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Crikey!

453
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:39,455
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one right now.

454
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:46,231
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple new Bimani websites have launched, and we're going to check them out right here, live on air.

455
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: First one, SoCalKicks.com did launch 5.0, I believe it is.

456
00:31:52,477 --> 00:32:04,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and this is the one where we were making fun of his tagline a couple weeks ago, because he has this tagline that says, SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now, but now it's just later, or just now, just this second.

457
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um, Rob.

458
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dave.

459
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got back from the other room.

460
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:09,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that game looks so boring.

461
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:15,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's some underlying secret mind control device, but it's like, okay.

462
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:15,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

463
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You talking about Animal Crossing?

464
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:17,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

465
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:17,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

466
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:18,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's addicting as hell.

467
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, I think I'll go change the music now.

468
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:24,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they show you the old school Nintendo games that you can play?

469
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:25,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

470
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them to go to my house and play the old school Nintendo games.

471
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:27,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

472
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:28,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will.

473
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Jameel, want to comment on Animal Crossing?

474
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:32,524
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was just saying yes.

475
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

476
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:35,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, back to SoCalKicks.com.

477
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

478
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:41,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to STK Max Ultimate Evolution just now.

479
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:45,726
[SPEAKER_03]: About time after a three-week wait and constant launch dates being flushed right down the drain.

480
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, the site relaunches.

481
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:51,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in time for SoCalKicks' birthday.

482
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:52,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

483
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:53,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday.

484
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,728
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot of people on board.

485
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:59,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to be doing the website stuff and none of us are on it.

486
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,474
Thank you for watching!

487
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:26,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, so what's so big about STK Max 5.0 that makes it better than the other versions?

488
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, well many things actually.

489
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:30,556
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time, they have forums.

490
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have some forums.

491
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:32,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty nice.

492
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I can read.

493
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:41,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, and they're going to be talking about all Bomani and it's not just going to be whoring out Konami of America stuff.

494
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:44,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be all DDR, so that'll be cool.

495
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see, they're going to do pad reviews, mod facts, blah blah blah, check it out for yourself, SoCalKicks.com.

496
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, let's see what these forums look like, I'm very curious.

497
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:55,197
[SPEAKER_03]: More forums.

498
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the generic layout for the forums, well that's okay.

499
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,460
[SPEAKER_03]: He says they're going to update that soon, so.

500
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:01,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I should register now, huh?

501
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:05,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can get in there and register right now, so I'll be like one of the first few members.

502
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, blah blah blah, I'm going to register for this new board.

503
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:10,869
[SPEAKER_11]: You do that.

504
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go get a taco.

505
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,188
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to go get a taco?

506
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:19,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to peruse another website.

507
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to peruse another website while I sign up for those forums.

508
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:24,965
[SPEAKER_03]: and Benso.

509
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:25,265
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya.

510
00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:27,258
Thank you for watching

511
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:39,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demends It

512
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:42,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that simple.

513
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

514
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm going to see, I'm going to the Cher concert.

515
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:39,863
[SPEAKER_10]: You get to see Miss Porcelain.

516
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,364
[SPEAKER_03]: See what I'm really wanting to go see though?

517
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:45,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyndi Lauper's opening and she's just fucking fabulous so I can't wait to go.

518
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:48,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we will be taped next week.

519
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:53,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to hear it live, we'll be doing the normal shtick just on Saturday night as opposed to Sunday.

520
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So, outside of that, oh yes, we're going to be also doing a mini marathon next week.

521
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:06,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to catch up on some old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to be marathoning all of Season 1 next weekend.

522
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:07,404
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

523
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:08,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So tune in for that.

524
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this is something that you and I have discussed, and I forgot to mention it.

525
00:39:12,926 --> 00:39:14,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's fine.

526
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:18,847
[SPEAKER_11]: I told you before about a friend of mine who's doing a radio drama.

527
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, talk about this.

528
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

529
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:28,169
[SPEAKER_11]: One is actually based on I Feel Sick, which was Debbie's spinoff.

530
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:30,954
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm going to be a voice actor in it.

531
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:32,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be Oblivia.

532
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:36,816
[SPEAKER_11]: And we still need one more voice actor for this.

533
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:44,899
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend Michelle is very talented doing a very good adaptation of the comic, so we need one more voice actor.

534
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:51,181
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anyone's interested, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.

535
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested.

536
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you sound like a whiny gothy boy?

537
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:56,800
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

538
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:24,102
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

539
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:46,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Brand new, I'm not sure if this is going to be a blog or what it is.

540
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:52,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's a blog, but I'm being asked to hoard out by a chat regular of ours, DCB.

541
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:53,311
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good buddy of the show.

542
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:58,073
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be doing a tournament in Fremont, a DDR tourney in Fremont in January.

543
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:02,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Check the DDR Freak Tournament forums if you want more information on that.

544
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: A Fremont tournament in January.

545
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got this website called Killer Pals.

546
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:08,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Friends

547
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:24,482
[SPEAKER_14]: www.radbeats.com

548
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:48,569
[SPEAKER_03]: It's orange and blue

549
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Lissy, do they have a forum?

550
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,411
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the forum link doesn't work.

551
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:08,232
[SPEAKER_03]: How about links?

552
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:10,573
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not been added to the links page yet.

553
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:13,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Grr, hang thy head in shame.

554
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, we'll forgive them this once.

555
00:42:15,657 --> 00:42:17,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And the members page doesn't work.

556
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously this page is under construction, but it's something you should keep an eye on.

557
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,283
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty.

558
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:24,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're neat.

559
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:29,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I only know about half these people, but they're all neat.

560
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:31,598
[SPEAKER_03]: The half I do know are neat.

561
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:34,040
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very well taken care of and clean.

562
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,481
[SPEAKER_11]: They have good hygiene.

563
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:39,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit the killer pals, because Bongo demands it.

564
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

565
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:40,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

566
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 23rd Magus has a comment for you, Jamie.

567
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,328
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he could sound like a whiny goth boy, because he is.

568
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,070
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

569
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,551
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

570
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:58,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Do samples of your voice, try to sound, you know, do different types of voices and say different things and email me that.

571
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:01,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Meet me later on AIM and I'll get that from you.

572
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're having an argument in the chat room about tilde versus tilde.

573
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Squiggly thing.

574
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:09,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Squiggly thing, exactly.

575
00:43:09,693 --> 00:43:12,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go to dictionary.com and look up the word.

576
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,097
[SPEAKER_03]: All hail the squiggly thing.

577
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:20,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll have a pronunciation key there so you don't have to actually go into a dictionary or feel it.

578
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's our website tour for the week.

579
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, is there any other website news that you know of?

580
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Things going on?

581
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any big websites that have been renovated?

582
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:33,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Mergers?

583
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Buyouts?

584
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:35,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Sellouts?

585
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:47,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than the couple week old 2DX style going down, I guess they're doing more to the Monty style to kind of incorporate the junk that they were covering with 2DXstyle.com on there.

586
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:49,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will probably be going on.

587
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:56,459
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another site that's coming up at some point, DDRextreme.com, and there's going to be some stuff on there.

588
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:59,421
[SPEAKER_05]: They already have the little page saying coming soon, that kind of thing.

589
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:05,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from that, oh, Dance Dance Evolution's down now for good.

590
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me make one quick interruption.

591
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Michelle, I see you, and yes I did whore out the show.

592
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:12,368
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to have that last voice actor.

593
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:38,036
[SPEAKER_03]: LeechTrumLokiTK will soon be hosting

[SPEAKER_03]: D.D.R.

00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:56,861
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was still a nerd back then though too, right?

598
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:10,294
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to talk to you about is, because I like to bring strangers on the show occasionally that know nothing about DDR, just ask you, what do you think when you see this for the first time, this DDR fanatic fan club?

599
00:46:11,294 --> 00:46:12,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we crazy, or what is it?

600
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:14,336
[SPEAKER_03]: No, frankly, you scare me.

601
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:14,816
[SPEAKER_03]: We scare you?

602
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we scare you?

603
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:16,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.

604
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:19,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just all the dancing and all the weird things you guys do.

605
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: All the weird things?

606
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?

607
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand plants and bar raping?

608
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and you know what?

609
00:46:24,262 --> 00:46:24,942
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

610
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:30,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I see some of the stuff that you guys, the dance moves and stuff.

611
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of weird.

612
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of different.

613
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:33,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird in a good way, I should say.

614
00:46:37,535 --> 00:46:43,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, but what I did want to talk to Elena about is that she just discovered the world of PlayStation 2, what, two weeks ago?

615
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,442
[SPEAKER_03]: How did this happen?

616
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:55,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my roommate's boyfriend, Mike, brought over a PlayStation, and this is really a big upgrade for us over at my roommate's and my house.

617
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,493
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the original Atari, and we have been playing it, actually.

618
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:00,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.

619
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:00,814
[SPEAKER_08]: The original.

620
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:02,756
[SPEAKER_08]: We play Space Invaders and all the fun stuff.

621
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you about Atari 2600.

622
00:47:04,337 --> 00:47:08,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've been playing Atari 2600 up until two weeks ago.

623
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all about fucking Atari.

624
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

625
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,881
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best Atari 2600 game you've ever played in your whole life?

626
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:15,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders.

627
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders?

628
00:47:16,422 --> 00:47:16,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

629
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

630
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:18,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

631
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakout.

632
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:20,184
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because you're a bastard.

633
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:20,564
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

634
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:21,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaboom.

635
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaboom.

636
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:23,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Kaboom is the best.

637
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:24,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Kangaroo.

638
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,527
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't like Kangaroo at all.

639
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:27,107
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

640
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a 5200 and it's all about kicks.

641
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:31,309
[SPEAKER_11]: See, we can't even get that game.

642
00:47:32,398 --> 00:47:36,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about a large group of drunk people playing combat.

643
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:37,503
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

644
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:43,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm being yelled at in the chat room because Atari 2600 is not the original Atari.

645
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only Atari that matters, so shove it.

646
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:53,898
[SPEAKER_11]: There was the Pong system, and there was some other one that was like a maze one.

647
00:47:54,198 --> 00:48:03,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but this is... Yeah, but as far as conventional systems go, the Atari 2600 is probably the granddaddy, unless you count the Fairchild Channel F that came out before it.

648
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even play Game Boy?

649
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,641
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, I haven't ever played Game Boy.

650
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:10,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't ever played Game Boy.

651
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you just don't think you can get into the DDR?

652
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:17,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the turntable game, the 2DX, the turntable game with the buttons?

653
00:48:17,522 --> 00:48:17,562
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

654
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,104
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

655
00:48:19,385 --> 00:48:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just intimidating?

656
00:48:20,988 --> 00:48:23,274
[SPEAKER_03]: What frightens you about DDR?

657
00:48:29,026 --> 00:48:32,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see, you don't got no time for DDR.

658
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:36,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy Elena, she got time to be doing the Space Invaders.

659
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:38,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But heaven forbid you ask her to dance a little.

660
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:41,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Space Invaders is an awfully good drunk party game.

661
00:48:41,956 --> 00:48:43,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so is DDR.

662
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:47,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been to the house parties, you know.

663
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I can play 2DX drunk and do pretty good.

664
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,474
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

665
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:56,076
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not only just DDR that is a little strange.

666
00:48:56,096 --> 00:48:58,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I came to a party that you were at.

667
00:48:58,677 --> 00:48:58,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

668
00:48:58,937 --> 00:48:59,798
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys were playing...

669
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:02,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Parapara.

670
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:06,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Parapara scares even us, so it's okay.

671
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we got Ryan to wear Ina's clothing.

672
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:11,148
[SPEAKER_11]: That was great.

673
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:17,111
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one of our friends, Ryan, SDMX, he actually wore his girlfriend's clothes to play Parapara.

674
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures were taken of this and put on other websites, yes.

675
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:23,093
[SPEAKER_08]: That's insane.

676
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,174
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an insane party.

677
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:26,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get you to play that?

678
00:49:26,435 --> 00:49:27,796
[SPEAKER_03]: How is Parapara frightening to you?

679
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:28,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't drunk.

680
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:30,946
[SPEAKER_03]: How is Parapara frightening?

681
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:31,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.

682
00:49:31,746 --> 00:49:37,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, it's not in English.

683
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:40,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, most of the songs are in English and all the text in the game is too.

684
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the one that you guys had on that night.

685
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The Macarena's in Spanish.

686
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows the Macarena.

687
00:49:46,492 --> 00:49:47,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, gutter.

688
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the scary thing I think about Pot of Potta is that when you watch the people who know the dances, and then you have five people behind them who all know the dances too.

689
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that going on when you were here?

690
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:07,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That we were all going, boom, boom, deluxe, da, da, da, da, da, da, shake my ass, shake my ass.

691
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:09,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a whole room of people.

692
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:11,590
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very, very... I can totally understand.

693
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:22,223
[SPEAKER_05]: At the MGL Tournament 2, I think it was, when they were having that go on, people around the Parapara second mix, I was just walking the room and all of a sudden you see 30 people doing it.

694
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:23,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap!

695
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:24,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Zombies!

696
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:24,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Run!

697
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:26,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still all over again!

698
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:32,135
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the sad thing about it in Japan and Hawaii and basically all over the area?

699
00:50:32,536 --> 00:50:35,460
[SPEAKER_11]: The pata pata dance, there's whole clubs of people who do this.

700
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody dresses the same because, you know, it's easier to do pata pata when you have no sleeves and everything.

701
00:50:40,908 --> 00:50:45,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, because knowing Elena, I know something about Elena that y'all don't know, so I'm coming in armed.

702
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:50,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Elena, don't you do country line dancing?

703
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:52,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, not since there hasn't been a club in Sacramento.

704
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:53,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

705
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:58,296
[SPEAKER_03]: How is country line dancing different than para-para, except the music in para-para is better?

706
00:51:01,237 --> 00:51:04,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what, I never country line dance without some alcohol in me, so no.

707
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:07,180
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing about pata-pata is just...

708
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:10,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Neil.

709
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:12,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because with country line dancing, you're not doing it alone.

710
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:12,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

711
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:14,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not looking like a single fool.

712
00:51:14,928 --> 00:51:18,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't have idiot shadowing behind you.

713
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:21,696
[SPEAKER_11]: At actual pata pata clubs, they have everybody doing the same thing with you.

714
00:51:21,756 --> 00:51:23,478
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody looks like they're all in a pack.

715
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I took you to a para para club, do you think you'd get down and boogie?

716
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:29,065
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I probably could handle the dances.

717
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:29,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think.

718
00:51:34,864 --> 00:51:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: No offense, you know, I love you.

719
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,226
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the best thing I've heard all night.

720
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:39,706
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so owned.

721
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:42,728
[SPEAKER_11]: You get winner points today.

722
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:45,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Alaina gets escorted off the show now.

723
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:47,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being with us tonight.

724
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

725
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Big hugs.

726
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:49,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

727
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy Gran Turismo.

728
00:51:51,332 --> 00:51:53,072
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your new addiction, Gran Turismo.

729
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on top, man.

730
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:54,533
227.9.

731
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_08]: What car are you using?

732
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:01,035
[SPEAKER_03]: are something.

733
00:52:01,396 --> 00:52:01,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

734
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take you to play Initial D someday.

735
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:10,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we must take you to play Initial D. You will love Initial D. This is the only game I have played on these new PlayStations.

736
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:12,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to learn one before I move on to the next.

737
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to graduate to Initial D next week.

738
00:52:14,403 --> 00:52:16,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe some Grand Theft Auto after that.

739
00:52:16,404 --> 00:52:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

740
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

741
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:18,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Elena.

742
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Big hand for Elena.

743
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:20,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

744
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need to get Vice City.

745
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:22,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neil was in there too.

746
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:25,990
[SPEAKER_11]: I still need to get Vice City so that I can go around and kill people.

747
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get hookers to sleep with you.

748
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:28,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want a hooker.

749
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:34,013
[SPEAKER_11]: See, the thing is, they don't have, you know, like, man sluts out on the street in that game.

750
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,713
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to have man sluts.

751
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:41,275
[SPEAKER_11]: There needs to be... Okay, you know, they just put out Tokimeki Memorial Girlside, where you can, you know, date the boys.

752
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:47,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to have GTA Chick version, where you can go pick up the man sluts off the streets.

753
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:55,929
[SPEAKER_11]: and go on this female crusade, you know, beating wife beaters and everything and setting houses on fire.

754
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:57,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, watching Oprah.

755
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:03,092
[SPEAKER_11]: You can, like, have the militant female mission and everything.

756
00:53:03,552 --> 00:53:04,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I'm hungry.

757
00:53:04,853 --> 00:53:06,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, here's some bonbons on the ground.

758
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, yum, yum, yum.

759
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, I gotta get the car over to Mervin's.

760
00:53:10,876 --> 00:53:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a sale.

761
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:12,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Open, open, open, open.

762
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:14,517
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no.

763
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:15,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like that.

764
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

765
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:17,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

766
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to take a really quick break.

767
00:53:56,568 --> 00:54:00,429
[SPEAKER_03]: In the chat room to Sky, that's me, and they'll have your FUs of the week.

768
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:03,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So send those now, and we'll read those on the air when we come back.

769
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Let us know what has you really hacked off.

770
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:10,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, if you're too lazy, you don't want to join our chat room, you want a little bit of anonymity, that's fine.

771
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:14,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

772
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you say, don't say my name on the air, we won't.

773
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can do your anonymous FUs.

774
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:19,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

775
00:54:19,594 --> 00:54:20,595
[SPEAKER_11]: You can be a win.

776
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, would you like to dedicate this first song during the break?

777
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:25,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I dedicate this song to me because I love it.

778
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:26,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

779
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:43,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lost inside of me Trapped in emotion Where am I going to?

780
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,904
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

781
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,514
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

782
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:25,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:05,716
Thank you for watching!

784
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:50,160
Thank you for watching!

785
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:06,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

786
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:11,965
[SPEAKER_19]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

787
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:18,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

788
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:20,987
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

789
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:25,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

790
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:32,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's our buddy Mel B there, saying hello to all of us and all of you listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

791
01:00:33,177 --> 01:00:34,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to have him back on the show sometime.

792
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:37,419
[SPEAKER_11]: He can pull off that tone very well.

793
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he's very smooth.

794
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's very smooth.

795
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

796
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:47,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so as promised, it's time to talk about the FUs of the week.

797
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:49,466
[SPEAKER_11]: We can be pissy.

798
01:00:50,327 --> 01:00:53,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, why don't you give us a little background on the FUs of the week.

799
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:54,970
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 22 weeks running now.

800
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,191
[SPEAKER_03]: No longer than that, about 24 weeks.

801
01:00:57,211 --> 01:00:59,091
[SPEAKER_11]: It started with our very first show.

802
01:00:59,332 --> 01:00:59,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

803
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was feeling particularly angsty one day and wanted to just vent, vent, vent, vent.

804
01:01:04,334 --> 01:01:05,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what?

805
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:06,154
[SPEAKER_11]: You all get to hear it.

806
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:12,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, the whole thing with having the FU's of the week is basically it is our time to vent.

807
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,897
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the things that aggravate us.

808
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:14,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We're people.

809
01:01:14,558 --> 01:01:15,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We're human.

810
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:19,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get this out of our system or we'll go crazy and we'll take you with us.

811
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

812
01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:26,825
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what the FUs of the week are for, and eventually the chatroom got as angsty as we did, so we let them in on the fun too.

813
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:29,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And you still can sit in on the fun.

814
01:01:29,707 --> 01:01:32,789
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us your FUs of the week, you just send those over a private message and we'll take care of it.

815
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:36,012
[SPEAKER_11]: See, even the stupid ferret has an FU of the week.

816
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:37,673
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

817
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:42,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready to begin with your FU of the week, Jamie?

818
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:42,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do.

819
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:43,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's kick it off.

820
01:01:44,258 --> 01:01:45,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is fucked up.

821
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

822
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,811
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the week, I have a few, as usual.

823
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, the last few weeks have been a little bit happier, haven't had so much to bitch about.

824
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:58,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to say fuck you to Ragnarok Online.

825
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,314
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why, okay?

826
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:11,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been sitting there for three months waiting for the server to come back up so that I could get my character back in my lovely little goggles and be happy, and they're making us pay for it.

827
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:13,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that in and of itself is fine.

828
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:15,366
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, $10 for two months.

829
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:20,288
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not that bad, except the thing is that they haven't been letting people in with the server.

830
01:02:20,748 --> 01:02:24,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank God I didn't pay, because I don't want them to have my credit card number.

831
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:25,169
[SPEAKER_11]: So, fuck them.

832
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll play the Japanese one, which is opening up tomorrow.

833
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:32,752
[SPEAKER_14]: And, my next fucking week goes for, um...

834
01:02:36,346 --> 01:02:40,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it goes for the fact that I don't have anyone to play Phantasy Star Online with.

835
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:41,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying.

836
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:42,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there soon.

837
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:43,512
[SPEAKER_11]: We need people.

838
01:02:43,753 --> 01:02:51,640
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has Phantasy Star Online and managed to get their hands on a GameCube, you know, broadband adapter, stay with me, please.

839
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to play PSO by myself.

840
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:54,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay with me.

841
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:56,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to play a game?

842
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:58,065
Um...

843
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:04,630
[SPEAKER_11]: and other fucking salutes go toward my really awesome fans, my ones with a fire on them.

844
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:07,591
[SPEAKER_11]: They're tearing up already, and I've had the shoes barely for months.

845
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:08,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those shoes.

846
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got those shoes full, and they're tearing up, so piss me off.

847
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:18,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, um, in the next episode... This is one of the stupid people I have to drive to work with.

848
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:18,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

849
01:03:19,314 --> 01:03:25,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Sacramento's full of the most stupid fucking people in the world because they can't drive.

850
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,372
[SPEAKER_11]: SoCalKicks would like to share that he asked for Phantasy Star Online for his birthday.

851
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:32,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck getting the broadband adapter.

852
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:32,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, get this.

853
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:55,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo puts out the broadband adapter for the GameCube.

854
01:03:55,938 --> 01:03:56,581
[SPEAKER_22]: And Nintendo.

855
01:03:56,781 --> 01:03:58,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And then recalls the thing.

856
01:03:59,578 --> 01:04:08,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it was recalled or just if they stopped, you know, making them, but why put out a big multiplayer game and then stop making the adapter?

857
01:04:08,664 --> 01:04:09,604
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just retarded.

858
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:17,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, I've got mine because, you know, my fiancé being the manager of GameStop, he can pull those little strings and things like that.

859
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:21,312
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, in the meantime, you know, I'm gaming by myself.

860
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:25,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, if I go to Animal Crossing, because I really want to start playing Kingdom Hearts again.

861
01:04:25,315 --> 01:04:28,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I play Kingdom Hearts, that wave bird just stares at me.

862
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:31,579
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to check on your village.

863
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:34,581
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to check on your village.

864
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go by the looking way.

865
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:40,284
[SPEAKER_09]: You still have $300,000 to pay off on your own.

866
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:44,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's hear from Loki, Refuse of the Week.

867
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:46,168
First, if he has to go to eBay...

868
01:04:59,702 --> 01:05:02,084
[SPEAKER_05]: because, um, for a few reasons, actually.

869
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:08,969
[SPEAKER_05]: One, this annoying new ad campaign that they have going where it's like Broadway singers singing like stupid crap about eBay.

870
01:05:09,649 --> 01:05:11,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't want to hear about eBay.

871
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:15,453
[SPEAKER_05]: eBay's stupid, with all these people that bid last minute on stuff.

872
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I was winning the two bids on my, you know, hair-to-hair crap and my places too, and I definitely won.

873
01:05:22,378 --> 01:05:28,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, like, one second left, you know, people bid up, you know, on it going over the price of it.

874
01:05:29,298 --> 01:05:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I got one of the fucking bastards back because he bid up on, what was it, my PlayStation 2?

875
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bid up another $30 on it just to piss him off.

876
01:05:38,624 --> 01:05:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: That was cool.

877
01:05:40,185 --> 01:05:40,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

878
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:46,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you ended up paying like a good $40 over of what they were both worth, so that's a good thing.

879
01:05:46,602 --> 01:05:47,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you can have them.

880
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:48,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that.

881
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:52,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just hate eBay because it sucks.

882
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:53,963
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have anything good on there.

883
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:57,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I found, you know, a few caramels.

884
01:05:57,264 --> 01:05:57,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, oh.

885
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:01,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, my plan is to have an outlet store where they don't need your machines.

886
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:14,187
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want a machine to try out your little project on, I will volunteer mine.

887
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The Holidays.

888
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:37,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not because, you know, I'm like a Scrooge or, you know, I hate that kind of thing.

889
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:41,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hate, you know, I hate the whole, like, constantly playing Christmas music.

890
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:44,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have, like, four songs that they just play over and over.

891
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:45,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really annoying.

892
01:06:46,098 --> 01:06:52,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate, you know, these stupid Christmas sales and people dressed up like, you know, they're cold or something.

893
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:53,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate this shit.

894
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:54,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's annoying.

895
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:57,645
[SPEAKER_05]: People are so stupid around the holidays.

896
01:06:58,346 --> 01:06:58,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

897
01:06:59,606 --> 01:07:00,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

898
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sure back in tradition, you had candles up on the Christmas tree, but I don't think it ever wanted to progress to the point where, I have a giant plastic snowman in my front lawn!

899
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:28,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

900
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:33,859
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the houses that are tastefully done, with a few white lights here and there, but then there's the houses that Christmas throws up on.

901
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:35,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but not when you live in Ghettoville.

902
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghettoville doesn't have those tastefully done houses.

903
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, oh look, there's a giant American flag going across the whole court.

904
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:43,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, fun!

905
01:07:44,805 --> 01:07:47,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're just going to randomly throw up lights on our house.

906
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:49,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

907
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that part of Christmas and holidays.

908
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the commercialization of holidays.

909
01:07:54,955 --> 01:07:58,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

910
01:07:58,758 --> 01:08:00,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have anything sweet.

911
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:07,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been kind of tired, so... I would like to escape on this little holiday special.

912
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:07,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

913
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:17,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, everybody knows that I am very tolerant toward other religions and people's beliefs, but I really hate being preached to at Christmas time, okay?

914
01:08:18,924 --> 01:08:21,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate when people come to me, you're gonna go to hell if you don't believe this.

915
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:23,207
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Christmas.

916
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Those damn people and their Kwanzaa.

917
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:27,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

918
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:29,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

919
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:30,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Celebrate what you want.

920
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:35,692
[SPEAKER_11]: All these Christmas pageants and everything, and they have it snowing and crap.

921
01:08:36,192 --> 01:08:48,961
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, if you want to go historically, the time that they would have, you know, and this is coming from knowing lots of theologians and everything, if you want to go historically, when Jesus was born, okay, they were doing a census.

922
01:08:49,061 --> 01:08:53,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it census or census?

923
01:08:53,044 --> 01:08:53,884
[SPEAKER_11]: The plural of census, okay.

924
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:59,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, a census would have been done coming up into the spring season.

925
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:02,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So therefore, they first of all got Susan wrong.

926
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,813
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why Christmas is in the wintertime is because of the pagan holiday!

927
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:06,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

928
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:07,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Yule?

929
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,816
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

930
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:09,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Go get it.

931
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:10,298
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the whole Christmas tree?

932
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,059
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pagan!

933
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus did not have a Christmas tree at his manger.

934
01:09:15,544 --> 01:09:15,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

935
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:17,626
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know?

936
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:18,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you there?

937
01:09:18,607 --> 01:09:19,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see it?

938
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:24,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Douglas firs did not grow in Arabia.

939
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, sure.

940
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:29,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Not under this mystical, like, you know, birthing happening here.

941
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:32,815
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they just couldn't magically make a Douglas fir appear out of nowhere.

942
01:09:33,475 --> 01:09:35,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, and like, you know, bushes catch on fire every day.

943
01:09:37,019 --> 01:09:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, come on.

944
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,021
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Santa Claus?

945
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:41,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit.

946
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:42,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

947
01:09:42,424 --> 01:09:43,946
[SPEAKER_08]: You little Santa people.

948
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:45,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Just listen here.

949
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:48,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have to say, Santa Claus saved the day in my movie, Feeders 2.

950
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:54,357
[SPEAKER_05]: He kicked the ass against those aliens, you know, and Santa Claus is really, you know, awesome when he has a ray gun.

951
01:09:54,557 --> 01:10:02,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember in Nightmare Before Christmas, Sandy Claus.

952
01:10:04,339 --> 01:10:07,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how can I follow up these?

953
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:07,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

954
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to start doing my FUs first, because...

955
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:12,073
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

956
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:37,227
[SPEAKER_03]: and then He-Man, of course.

957
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:38,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, oh yes, my FUs of the week.

958
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:41,668
[SPEAKER_03]: My first FU of the week would be the Christmas carols as well.

959
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:43,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Taco Bell the other night listening to Christmas carols.

960
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:50,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I'm going to be so nauseatingly sick of Deck the Fucking Halls by the time 25th World's Around.

961
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you wait, just you wait.

962
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:52,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate Christmas carols.

963
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:58,312
[SPEAKER_03]: My second FU of the week would be to work because I don't want to go back.

964
01:10:58,372 --> 01:10:59,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I've enjoyed this little vacation too much.

965
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:01,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to go either.

966
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:08,289
[SPEAKER_03]: and my third FU of the week goes to Olivia at Animal Crossing because she's bipolar.

967
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:11,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to kill Olivia back in my village.

968
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,410
[SPEAKER_11]: That's rough for taking Olivia away from me.

969
01:11:13,631 --> 01:11:15,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess that's it.

970
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:18,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the chatroom FUs, shall we?

971
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:19,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get FUs.

972
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:20,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I have more.

973
01:11:20,853 --> 01:11:21,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You have more?

974
01:11:21,373 --> 01:11:21,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

975
01:11:21,753 --> 01:11:22,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

976
01:11:23,214 --> 01:11:24,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to the chatroom about their FUs.

977
01:11:24,755 --> 01:11:25,755
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, chatroom.

978
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:26,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.

979
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We do love the chatroom.

980
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:28,736
[SPEAKER_11]: You're special.

981
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:29,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

982
01:11:33,478 --> 01:11:35,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck you for doing Deck the Halls.

983
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:35,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Deck the Halls.

984
01:11:58,977 --> 01:11:59,778
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, yes, Loki.

985
01:11:59,798 --> 01:12:02,679
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an FU going out to, I can't remember the guy's name.

986
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was, I don't remember.

987
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, someone just released a remix of Let Them Move as a sim file, and it reminded me of one of Twen's things.

988
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:16,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, he said, and I quote, this one's actually worse than the ones I did.

989
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:19,330
[SPEAKER_05]: So that gets you an idea of how bad this thing is.

990
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:25,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to Twins FUs.

991
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to half the chat rooms for not ever taking a joke.

992
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:30,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, whatever.

993
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:33,019
[SPEAKER_11]: That was funny, ha ha ha.

994
01:12:33,059 --> 01:12:34,299
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some happy FUs.

995
01:12:34,339 --> 01:12:35,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want to hear happy FUs?

996
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:36,881
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

997
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:38,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your happy FUs and cram them.

998
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:39,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, he's at Pensacola.

999
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:40,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like from like near there.

1000
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:40,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1001
01:12:40,763 --> 01:12:40,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1002
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:41,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

1003
01:12:44,154 --> 01:12:45,515
[SPEAKER_11]: His girlfriend is from Pensacola.

1004
01:12:45,936 --> 01:12:47,777
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like an hour from where I used to live.

1005
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:53,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and he's going to miss Orange Lounge to go spend time with a woman.

1006
01:12:53,702 --> 01:13:00,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, hey, if you get a benefit from missing the show, you need to spend that time.

1007
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:04,691
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to miss this show for some pussy, then I suppose, you know, we can forgive you.

1008
01:13:06,973 --> 01:13:08,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh, let's see, moving right along.

1009
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:15,195
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a showgirls moment.

1010
01:13:16,595 --> 01:13:31,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Stresa says, um, F you to the three days that he's played DDR, he's not that bad at all, and he can do almost any direction on the damn pad, do pretty well, I can pull off light freestyle for four foot, five foot, so I can do pretty darn good.

1011
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:34,560
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a noob, and F anyone who says he's a noobie.

1012
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1013
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:37,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, you're not new.

1014
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:38,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got to start somewhere.

1015
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,642
[SPEAKER_03]: We all got to start somewhere.

1016
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:45,303
[SPEAKER_03]: DSCS SoCalKick says, FU to PHP Conflictions.

1017
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:47,904
[SPEAKER_03]: He really doesn't have any FUs other than that.

1018
01:13:48,604 --> 01:13:50,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he's a happy camper outside of that.

1019
01:13:53,351 --> 01:13:59,496
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFBB says Dear Lord, there's a lot.

1020
01:13:59,596 --> 01:13:59,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1021
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:03,239
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to people who attended Comdex in Vegas.

1022
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,001
[SPEAKER_03]: You whores made traffic a nightmare.

1023
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:10,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to all the exhibitors especially because it went for the free stuff and he left disappointed.

1024
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Comdex sucks.

1025
01:14:12,227 --> 01:14:13,908
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to whoever thought of Thanksgiving.

1026
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:16,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got a fridge full of leftovers and I'm already sick of turkey.

1027
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:20,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving because pizza is still good the next day.

1028
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:21,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

1029
01:14:24,196 --> 01:14:26,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Time for the plugs, since everybody else got a plug.

1030
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:32,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly websites, but while in Vegas, be sure to visit VidPower's restaurant, Cheerful Chinese Cuisine, in sunny Las Vegas.

1031
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:38,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Open six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, at 1223 East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.

1032
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:39,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Call for takeout.

1033
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

1034
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:45,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, we don't want the address broadcast.

1035
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I just read it.

1036
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:49,772
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1037
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:51,233
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get business.

1038
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:57,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to say it first, then I won't say it.

1039
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I just read in order.

1040
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:02,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I read from top to bottom, top to bottom.

1041
01:15:04,545 --> 01:15:05,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm done with his FUs now.

1042
01:15:05,887 --> 01:15:07,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to next FUs.

1043
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:10,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The next set of FUs comes from 23rd Magus.

1044
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:15,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big FU to Chatroom Drama because it's there.

1045
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,123
[SPEAKER_03]: A medium-sized FU to Matsuri Japan Maniac for throwing off my groove.

1046
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:27,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bite-sized FU, I like that, a bite-sized FU to Battle.net for screwing up every time he connects.

1047
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And also a fuck me to any available ladies.

1048
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, hello.

1049
01:15:32,053 --> 01:15:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

1050
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, this isn't hot or not.

1051
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:36,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa!

1052
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:37,915
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1053
01:15:38,195 --> 01:15:39,715
[SPEAKER_03]: No selling meat here on Orange Lounge.

1054
01:15:40,155 --> 01:15:42,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And one last FU to the Skrull system.

1055
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:43,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I need no explanation.

1056
01:15:43,636 --> 01:15:44,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I want all their balls to die.

1057
01:15:45,997 --> 01:15:46,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need shirts.

1058
01:15:47,177 --> 01:15:49,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need shirts that say that.

1059
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I want all your balls to die.

1060
01:15:51,098 --> 01:15:53,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we ask the person who made that shockwave thing?

1061
01:15:53,438 --> 01:15:54,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a shockwave?

1062
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize there was a shockwave.

1063
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:55,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my bad.

1064
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:59,620
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really bad version of the Romeo and Juliette.

1065
01:16:00,746 --> 01:16:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's an even better one, though, that was Harry Potter.

1066
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:05,230
[SPEAKER_11]: With the Draco dance.

1067
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:15,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, VidPower says, FU of the week goes to germs, once again, because my voice is all harsh and scraggly, and whenever I cough, my body feels like crap.

1068
01:16:16,278 --> 01:16:18,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And FU to stupid, mean bowling attendants.

1069
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:19,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1070
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck them.

1071
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:20,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.

1072
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Brack2000 says, FU to Nori Nori Nori, and that one's for 23 Megas.

1073
01:16:27,906 --> 01:16:29,668
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing an FU on behalf of somebody else.

1074
01:16:33,066 --> 01:16:33,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1075
01:16:33,827 --> 01:16:38,633
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Angel says, Hello, I made our window disappear.

1076
01:16:38,654 --> 01:16:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is again.

1077
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to stomp to my beat, because it hates Stresa and I, and it won't let us pass it.

1078
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:46,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That F you was from Stresa and DDR Angel.

1079
01:16:47,586 --> 01:16:48,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, keep working at it.

1080
01:16:48,507 --> 01:16:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we say?

1081
01:16:49,127 --> 01:16:53,529
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're playing the Maniac, the fourth plus steps are pretty hard, too, from what I remember.

1082
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:58,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't remember which version's on Max USA, but keep working at it.

1083
01:16:58,532 --> 01:16:59,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best advice we can give you.

1084
01:17:00,092 --> 01:17:03,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Always just keep playing, practice, practice, practice, and you'll get it eventually.

1085
01:17:03,514 --> 01:17:03,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

1086
01:17:03,874 --> 01:17:09,157
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRholic says, it isn't so much an FU, but just a question.

1087
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:11,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you guys been on Wednesdays?

1088
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:13,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys go to RVGL on another day or have you just been busy?

1089
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:18,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but she does want to second Loki's FU to the commercialism of the holidays, especially the competition.

1090
01:17:18,525 --> 01:17:21,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Who freaking cares who has the most expensive decorations?

1091
01:17:21,446 --> 01:17:22,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen, sister.

1092
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:23,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for a second there, guys.

1093
01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep reading your name.

1094
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:25,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1095
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:28,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying D-D-Arcoholic, but that's a different person.

1096
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,329
[SPEAKER_03]: D-D-Arcoholic.

1097
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an alcoholic.

1098
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:32,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1099
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:33,211
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1100
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:36,392
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I'm not in real radio.

1101
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,113
[SPEAKER_11]: D-D-Arcoholic.

1102
01:17:38,837 --> 01:17:45,960
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1103
01:18:04,808 --> 01:18:06,990
[SPEAKER_03]: and probably on Thursday actually, not Wednesday.

1104
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

1105
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,731
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit easier to get there on Thursday.

1106
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:10,152
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit easier for us to get there on Thursday.

1107
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:12,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it may transfer the time to Scandia because we love Scandia so much more.

1108
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1109
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:15,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Diddy, Alcoholic, dear, send me an email.

1110
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:21,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Send the show an email, orangelawnsradio at yahoo.com and we'll plan a day to hook up and meet because we like you.

1111
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can give up a Wednesday.

1112
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give up a Wednesday one week to come meet you.

1113
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:25,483
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

1114
01:18:26,124 --> 01:18:26,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1115
01:18:26,324 --> 01:18:27,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have something to say?

1116
01:18:27,065 --> 01:18:27,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley.

1117
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:29,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, no, maybe so?

1118
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:29,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

1119
01:18:29,546 --> 01:18:29,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1120
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:29,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1121
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do I have music?

1122
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:33,868
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1123
01:18:34,128 --> 01:18:34,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get you some music.

1124
01:18:34,988 --> 01:18:35,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1125
01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:40,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you some happy guitar freaky music here if I can find some.

1126
01:18:40,951 --> 01:18:42,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to give you something new.

1127
01:18:42,672 --> 01:18:43,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Kachaka?

1128
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:44,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do Kachaka.

1129
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:46,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Kachaka, Kachaka.

1130
01:18:47,614 --> 01:18:47,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

1131
01:18:48,055 --> 01:18:48,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

1132
01:18:48,675 --> 01:18:49,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither does Cowgirl, but hey.

1133
01:18:50,096 --> 01:18:53,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take fuck you to secondhand smoke.

1134
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:57,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really, really, really hate cigarette smoke.

1135
01:18:57,379 --> 01:19:00,241
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of my most hated smells in the entire world.

1136
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:20,785
[SPEAKER_06]: and especially a bad because like in one of the local arcade or the jail guitar freaks and drum manias kind of close to the front door so often I smell the smoke from the parents who I smoke with a few packs of 10 and kill my lungs for a while

1137
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:27,704
[SPEAKER_06]: and also fuck you to the cigarette smoke that's closest to my door at some mysterious location.

1138
01:19:28,204 --> 01:19:32,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel any air ducts from the cracks in the windows or something.

1139
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:36,728
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just noise and a lot of stuff.

1140
01:19:36,788 --> 01:19:42,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And for this week, fuck you to myself for being a thoughtless bastard and never calling my parents.

1141
01:19:43,564 --> 01:19:46,026
[SPEAKER_06]: and our Asian relatives for Thanksgiving.

1142
01:19:46,686 --> 01:19:47,066
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1143
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:48,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanksgiving is a commercial holiday.

1144
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:49,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Butterball independent.

1145
01:19:50,028 --> 01:19:50,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.

1146
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:53,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I have to talk to you, but I'm coming over to save your room.

1147
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I did that to my family.

1148
01:20:11,324 --> 01:20:13,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting a recommendation.

1149
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:15,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to check the email box because we don't want to miss any FUs.

1150
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back.

1151
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:17,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1152
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:18,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we've got a couple.

1153
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:19,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, we've got a few.

1154

[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck space heaters that don't work because it's too cold.

[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from Mooheimer.

01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Mooheimer.

1162
01:21:07,856 --> 01:21:15,780
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, my fuckyous would be the damn expansion pack enemies in Diablo 2 and dumb weathermen for getting me all excited about a snowstorm that turned into nothing.

1163
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck those weathermen.

1164
01:21:17,381 --> 01:21:19,542
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I actually was going to be a weatherman.

1165
01:21:23,981 --> 01:21:25,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's where it came from.

1166
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1167
01:21:26,543 --> 01:21:26,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1168
01:21:28,585 --> 01:21:32,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had some FUs from Martin, who's the guy that sent us the email earlier in the show.

1169
01:21:32,168 --> 01:21:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot, too.

1170
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,651
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Fuck Christmas shopping for all the crazy people.

1171
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the crazy people that shop during the Christmas shopping season.

[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck my manager for making me work the day after Thanksgiving and not giving me hazard pay.

1175
01:21:55,293 --> 01:21:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means.

1176
01:21:56,114 --> 01:21:57,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying the word land.

1177
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:57,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1178
01:21:58,436 --> 01:22:00,958

01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:16,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame, shame, you shouldn't be kicking machines.

1186
01:22:16,177 --> 01:22:17,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1187
01:22:18,219 --> 01:22:19,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Banning's a little harsh.

1188
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,444
[SPEAKER_03]: If they didn't tell you not to do it, then they should at least have a courtesy warning.

1189
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they warned you and said don't do it, then you did it again, can't have much sympathy for you.

1190
01:22:28,269 --> 01:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta respect the arcade's rules.

1191
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they just kicked you out with no warning, that's not cool, so fuck them.

1192
01:22:33,853 --> 01:22:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: and fuck his computer for not being compatible with 3DXcelic Creator Card.

1193
01:22:37,395 --> 01:22:39,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, he must be on a Mac.

1194
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:44,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it.

1195
01:22:44,078 --> 01:22:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the FUs of the week.

1196
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them wrapped into one big little... Oh, I got a response from DDRcoholic.

1197
01:22:52,941 --> 01:22:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Says, I can say holic if I want.

1198
01:22:55,502 --> 01:22:57,302
[SPEAKER_03]: because it can be my nickname for her.

1199
01:22:57,322 --> 01:22:58,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get to call her DDRholic if I want.

1200
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:04,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and one quick F you because of the, uh, little image that flashed up on your screen while you were closing down Yahoo.

1201
01:23:05,384 --> 01:23:10,085
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to that stupid movie Extreme Ops because that's the pissed pile of shit I've ever seen.

1202
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:10,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that!

1203
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, we're gonna add extreme people in a spy situation.

1204
01:23:14,165 --> 01:23:15,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, that's never been done before.

1205
01:23:16,006 --> 01:23:18,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, yeah it was.

1206
01:23:18,546 --> 01:23:21,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, F you for these stupid extreme spy movies.

1207
01:23:22,027 --> 01:23:23,467
[SPEAKER_05]: No one wants us to get it, no one cares.

1208
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:24,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck bad movies.

1209
01:23:25,356 --> 01:23:26,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck Lawyers, Fuck IMAX

1210
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1211
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:09,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it on the platter for now.

1212
01:24:09,808 --> 01:24:11,989
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of fun.

1213
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:17,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start this music break off with a little song from 2DX6Style.

1214
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very popular one.

1215
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:20,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have heard it a couple times.

1216
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in DDR Extreme as well.

1217
01:24:22,593 --> 01:24:22,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1218
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,854
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1219
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:42,193
DJ Ranma S

1220
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:27,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we're back.

1221
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a quick mic check here.

1222
01:26:29,302 --> 01:26:31,844
[SPEAKER_03]: No, see, we're not coming through if I don't turn that booster on.

1223
01:26:32,545 --> 01:26:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: There, now you can hear us, see?

1224
01:26:34,546 --> 01:26:36,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to fix our audio problems right now here in-house.

1225
01:26:36,628 --> 01:26:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if we can turn down the volume a little bit.

1226
01:26:40,952 --> 01:26:42,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you still hear us just fine?

1227
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:43,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, hello.

1228
01:26:43,795 --> 01:26:44,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

1229
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:44,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

1230
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:45,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

1231
01:26:48,676 --> 01:26:50,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I still hear it a little bit, though.

1232
01:26:50,176 --> 01:26:50,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so annoying.

1233
01:26:52,397 --> 01:26:53,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's causing that, you guys.

1234
01:26:53,657 --> 01:26:54,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1235
01:26:54,657 --> 01:26:56,158
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to do what we can.

1236
01:26:57,218 --> 01:27:02,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have to just kind of throw the computer against a brick wall this week and see if we can't fix it that way.

1237
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:04,640
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll pick up the pieces and put it back together with duct tape.

1238
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:06,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Mute your line in.

1239
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:08,941
[SPEAKER_03]: The line in is muted.

1240
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:10,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1241
01:27:10,621 --> 01:27:11,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you guys.

1242
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:11,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1243
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:12,142
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.

1244
01:27:12,162 --> 01:27:13,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do about the popping.

1245
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:15,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Just deal.

1246
01:27:15,822 --> 01:27:18,006
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, here's something from Poppin' Music.

1247
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:18,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play for you guys.

1248
01:27:19,549 --> 01:27:21,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will be right back.

1249
01:29:10,413 --> 01:29:11,858
Thank you for watching!

1250
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,381
DarkSakura.com

1251
01:30:54,777 --> 01:31:19,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy Dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy Little boy, dream on my little boy Dream on my little boy Go out and have some joy

1252
01:32:32,506 --> 01:32:33,614
Thank you for watching!

1253
01:34:21,553 --> 01:34:26,519
[SPEAKER_12]: From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bomani stuff, comes our Bomani science lesson of the day.

1254
01:34:27,299 --> 01:34:30,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

1255
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray, a fan-made promo we got.

1256
01:34:40,082 --> 01:34:40,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's tack.

1257
01:34:41,222 --> 01:34:44,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has tack, so it already gets Jamie's seal of approval.

1258
01:34:45,486 --> 01:34:45,926
[SPEAKER_03]: We like that.

1259
01:34:46,907 --> 01:34:48,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, 23Megas, for sending us that promo.

1260
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it is a little quiet.

1261
01:34:49,929 --> 01:34:55,894
[SPEAKER_03]: You do want to double-check and make sure that it's always nice and loud, that your levels are somewhere in the yellow.

1262
01:34:55,994 --> 01:34:57,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the red, but just at the tip of the yellow.

1263
01:34:58,436 --> 01:35:00,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little recording advice tip from me.

1264
01:35:00,097 --> 01:35:01,078
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, fantastic.

1265
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:01,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

1266
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:06,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, let's talk about some actual Bamani news this week, shall we?

1267
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:07,181
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1268
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:10,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not really news, but just kind of some interesting little things.

1269
01:35:10,382 --> 01:35:12,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Bamani Olds?

1270
01:35:13,023 --> 01:35:15,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's Bamani Olds.

1271
01:35:15,363 --> 01:35:24,606
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an interesting thread that came up on one of the big message boards this week that talks about a solo machine that was upgraded to a Max 2.

1272
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:25,507
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1273
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:29,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody took a solo machine and upgraded it to a Max 2.

1274
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the freaking point?

1275
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you recall, Max 2 has no six-panel mode in it, so you've pretty much just taken two of your arrows and completely wasted them.

1276
01:35:41,086 --> 01:35:46,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm bringing up pictures here in the room so that Jamie can take a look for herself, see what this machine's all about.

1277
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:50,452
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think it... Loki, I gotta get your opinion on this, being the tech massa.

1278
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:53,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, it curves the bar forward.

1279
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:55,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a typical solo bar.

1280
01:35:55,235 --> 01:35:56,356
[SPEAKER_04]: A solo bar looks like that.

1281
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different than Max 2.

1282
01:35:58,397 --> 01:36:00,479
[SPEAKER_11]: That means it's actually a Japanese machine, by the way.

1283
01:36:00,879 --> 01:36:02,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You can rate the bar in a whole new way.

1284
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,721
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a Japanese machine.

1285
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:06,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1286
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:09,885
[SPEAKER_05]: They just put a DDR Max upgrade in the solo machine.

1287
01:36:09,905 --> 01:36:11,406
[SPEAKER_05]: What more do you need to know?

1288
01:36:11,426 --> 01:36:12,066
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they did.

1289
01:36:12,086 --> 01:36:14,328
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no modifications to it at all.

1290
01:36:14,408 --> 01:36:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just no way they're going to play doubles.

1291
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:19,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually kind of retarded because if you play doubles, you're fucked.

1292
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:23,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at the solos, or the doubles score ranking here.

1293
01:36:24,997 --> 01:36:26,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always going to be empty, forever.

1294
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:32,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fucked if you pick doubles, so it's guitar, unless it's your own home thing, and that's all you've got, it's a solo machine, but...

1295
01:36:34,728 --> 01:36:35,548
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really stupid.

1296
01:36:35,588 --> 01:36:38,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to 4th Plus or even that unofficial 5th Mix.

1297
01:36:40,511 --> 01:36:44,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stick with it.

1298
01:36:44,473 --> 01:36:45,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the cream of the crop.

1299
01:36:45,693 --> 01:36:53,777
[SPEAKER_03]: As it says in the post, I believe it says in the post somewhere, it says later, oh yeah, and then there's a regular Max 2 machine, just two machines over from this.

1300
01:36:54,617 --> 01:36:55,498
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so stupid.

1301
01:36:57,198 --> 01:36:57,739
[SPEAKER_10]: That's retarded.

1302
01:36:57,759 --> 01:36:57,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't!

1303
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:05,374
[SPEAKER_03]: and the retard... That gets the Special Olympic Award stamp of the day.

1304
01:37:05,414 --> 01:37:06,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure, this guy's in Canada.

1305
01:37:07,676 --> 01:37:08,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, just kidding.

1306
01:37:09,037 --> 01:37:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Canadians.

1307
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:14,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say controversial things on this program.

1308
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:14,921
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

1309
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:16,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1310
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:18,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes with my hatred of the Greek.

1311
01:37:19,002 --> 01:37:20,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, it was a Greek?

1312
01:37:20,022 --> 01:37:23,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you have a good reason to hate them because they banned games.

1313
01:37:23,623 --> 01:37:24,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're stupid.

1314
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:26,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched my big fat Greek wedding.

1315
01:37:27,404 --> 01:37:27,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

1316
01:37:28,105 --> 01:37:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1317
01:37:28,685 --> 01:37:31,065
[SPEAKER_03]: That totally sounds like a movie you would not like.

1318
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:32,546
[SPEAKER_12]: It was alright.

1319
01:37:33,226 --> 01:37:34,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, it sounds like a movie.

1320
01:37:34,566 --> 01:37:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Brad, what do you think of this?

1321
01:37:35,507 --> 01:37:37,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Max 2 solo machine.

1322
01:37:39,105 --> 01:37:40,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go play Animal Crossing.

1323
01:37:41,386 --> 01:37:42,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer, good answer.

1324
01:37:43,506 --> 01:37:46,547
[SPEAKER_11]: That wins my special-enough-for-the-Olympic-stamp award of the day.

1325
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:48,927
[SPEAKER_11]: They get to ride the short bus.

1326
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:52,548
[SPEAKER_11]: With their own max solo machine, ooh.

1327
01:37:54,549 --> 01:38:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that could be possibly worse than a max two solo machine is a max one solo machine.

1328
01:38:01,971 --> 01:38:02,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a solo bass.

1329
01:38:04,324 --> 01:38:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think a solo bass is slightly better.

1330
01:38:06,945 --> 01:38:08,426
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it has my baby mama.

1331
01:38:08,626 --> 01:38:10,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I got even better.

1332
01:38:10,726 --> 01:38:12,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't exactly say upgrading.

1333
01:38:12,407 --> 01:38:15,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Downgrading a Max 2 full machine to a solo bass.

1334
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:19,990
[SPEAKER_03]: That's retarded right there.

1335
01:38:20,805 --> 01:38:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is somebody playing Burning Heat on that Max 2 solo machine.

1336
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,367
[SPEAKER_11]: God.

1337
01:38:27,888 --> 01:38:28,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1338
01:38:29,888 --> 01:38:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, yes.

1339
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is a few episodes back, but the only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is Upskirt Beatmania 5Key.

1340
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:39,152
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the cam.

1341
01:38:44,595 --> 01:38:44,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1342
01:38:44,975 --> 01:38:47,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about another topic, shall we?

1343
01:38:47,336 --> 01:38:48,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, please.

1344
01:38:48,477 --> 01:38:49,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along.

1345
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:50,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

1346
01:38:50,778 --> 01:39:04,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about another interesting thread that I saw was about this kind of... Since the Christmas season is here, there's this sudden push, and DDR is getting bigger and bigger and more and more well-known.

1347
01:39:04,124 --> 01:39:05,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Bigger and bitter.

1348
01:39:05,305 --> 01:39:08,086
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all getting bitter as the jaded old schoolers we are.

1349
01:39:08,746 --> 01:39:09,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that there's...

1350
01:39:10,808 --> 01:39:18,736
[SPEAKER_03]: There's these new children's Dance Pats games coming out, including a Barney game, a Barbie dance game that you plug directly into your TV.

1351
01:39:18,756 --> 01:39:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been out for a while, but of course it's Christmas time, so a lot of the stores are pushing these again.

1352
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, here's a Christmas toy that won't make your kid fat.

1353
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically how they're marketing these.

1354
01:39:28,565 --> 01:39:29,185
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very old.

1355
01:39:32,546 --> 01:39:34,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jungle Book dancing game.

1356
01:39:34,767 --> 01:39:38,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for those who don't know out there, this was out before Max USA even was.

1357
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember going to your old apartment.

1358
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:42,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the Jungle Book dance game.

1359
01:39:42,312 --> 01:39:44,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Playing on that tiny ass little pad.

1360
01:39:45,014 --> 01:39:47,796
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jungle Book dance pad was my very first dance pad.

1361
01:39:47,836 --> 01:39:49,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have the Jungle Book game too, but I don't have the pad.

1362
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:53,900
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jamie brought over third mix one night and we played all night long.

1363
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:54,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so much fun.

1364
01:39:54,581 --> 01:39:56,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, let me liberate your mind.

1365
01:39:56,843 --> 01:39:58,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.

1366
01:39:58,624 --> 01:40:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that, all I'd ever seen was USA and first mix and all of a sudden you put in third mix.

1367
01:40:03,489 --> 01:40:05,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh my god.

1368
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:05,811
[SPEAKER_09]: There's modes.

1369
01:40:05,971 --> 01:40:09,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Holiday, erotic, I'm in love.

1370
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:11,533
[SPEAKER_10]: and it has karaoke mode too!

1371
01:40:11,914 --> 01:40:13,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, in karaoke mode!

1372
01:40:13,456 --> 01:40:15,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Which there has never been in another mix.

1373
01:40:15,739 --> 01:40:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what do you guys think of all these little kid games?

1374
01:40:18,983 --> 01:40:21,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's good for the money because it trains them at a young age?

1375
01:40:22,027 --> 01:40:24,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the Hello Kitty DDR.

1376
01:40:25,131 --> 01:40:26,032
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for five year olds.

1377
01:40:26,052 --> 01:40:27,133
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually a DDR.

1378
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:33,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the Oha Kids arcade games?

1379
01:40:33,172 --> 01:40:34,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they have one in Vegas?

1380
01:40:34,932 --> 01:40:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say that one arcade you went to, they had a DDR for kids?

1381
01:40:38,134 --> 01:40:38,874
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1382
01:40:39,034 --> 01:40:40,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just on crack, I'm sorry.

1383
01:40:40,095 --> 01:40:41,535
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Radiant Silvergun.

1384
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:41,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1385
01:40:42,275 --> 01:40:43,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Who had the DDR for kids?

1386
01:40:43,936 --> 01:40:46,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have sworn somebody told me somebody in Vegas had them.

1387
01:40:46,097 --> 01:40:48,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in San Fran, I think.

1388
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:49,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisco.

1389
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:50,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

1390
01:40:52,446 --> 01:41:00,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, uh, I wouldn't call, some people in the chat room are talking about Disney's, Disney's Rave being a kid game.

1391
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, I'm sorry, Disney Mix in the U.S.

1392
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I don't, it's, you think Disney's Mix is for kids?

1393
01:41:07,233 --> 01:41:09,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dance Magic makes Disney Mix, though.

1394
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:14,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney's Rave is for, like, people who are like, I would like Parapara, but I want to get in the DDR.

1395
01:41:14,856 --> 01:41:15,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, there you go.

1396
01:41:16,256 --> 01:41:16,757
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

1397
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:19,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all, it's DDR Parapara Mix.

1398
01:41:20,323 --> 01:41:24,305
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower, who's from Vegas, by the way, is confirming they do have a DDR Kids machine there.

1399
01:41:25,325 --> 01:41:26,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that means it's OHA.

1400
01:41:26,666 --> 01:41:27,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it OHA songs?

1401
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:30,408
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower, what are the songs in DDR Kids?

1402
01:41:30,448 --> 01:41:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it OHA stuff, or what is it?

1403
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:36,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of asking questions to our chat room, waiting for a reply.

1404
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1405
01:41:40,532 --> 01:41:41,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1406
01:41:43,433 --> 01:41:43,673
[SPEAKER_03]: OHA.

1407
01:41:43,713 --> 01:41:44,654
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys talking about over there?

1408
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:48,331
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about Gameland in Las Vegas.

1409
01:41:48,451 --> 01:41:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, talk about Gameland.

1410
01:41:49,472 --> 01:41:51,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Gameland has DDR Kids.

1411
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:53,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being confirmed by VidPower.

1412
01:41:53,914 --> 01:41:54,654
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower's from Vegas.

1413
01:41:54,674 --> 01:41:59,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they must have gotten it after I played there, because I was there for the DDR Kids moderator trip.

1414
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:11,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they had, I went in there, and this is actually, when everybody was quoting each other what we said for the moderator trip, this is what I was quoted as going, Silvergun!

1415
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not OHA songs, I'm being corrected.

1416
01:42:15,494 --> 01:42:17,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different songs.

1417
01:42:17,855 --> 01:42:18,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can get.

1418
01:42:18,996 --> 01:42:19,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Special.

1419
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:20,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Different places!

1420
01:42:20,857 --> 01:42:22,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, get us a song list.

1421
01:42:22,257 --> 01:42:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get us a song list.

1422
01:42:23,298 --> 01:42:24,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to talk about it.

1423
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:25,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to come play.

1424
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:26,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go to Vegas.

1425
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:29,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We're planning an Orange Lounge Vegas trip at some point.

1426
01:42:29,882 --> 01:42:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and someone can pay for it.

1427
01:42:31,723 --> 01:42:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, VidPower does confirm they got it after you were there.

1428
01:42:34,405 --> 01:42:34,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1429
01:42:35,725 --> 01:42:35,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1430
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're gonna have to go play DDR Kids Mix.

1431
01:42:39,287 --> 01:42:39,927
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

1432
01:42:40,127 --> 01:42:42,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly better than anything that bitch Barbie can come up with.

1433
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, yes?

1434
01:42:44,469 --> 01:42:45,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say Barbie or Barney?

1435
01:42:50,011 --> 01:42:50,712
[SPEAKER_21]: They have them both.

1436
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:55,876
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, I'm not going to dance to I Love You, You Love Me.

1437
01:42:55,896 --> 01:42:56,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're both bitches.

1438
01:42:57,077 --> 01:42:58,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost.

1439
01:42:58,879 --> 01:43:00,520
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, your shirt's cool.

1440
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:01,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1441
01:43:01,361 --> 01:43:03,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad is wearing an 8-bit theater shirt.

1442
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:05,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I probably mentioned this on the radio already.

1443
01:43:05,265 --> 01:43:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a black mage.

1444
01:43:06,406 --> 01:43:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it says Bolt 2, motherfucker.

1445
01:43:09,388 --> 01:43:09,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Sick.

1446
01:43:12,029 --> 01:43:13,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Other big things in the news.

1447
01:43:13,051 --> 01:43:13,932
[SPEAKER_03]: This is big news.

1448
01:43:13,952 --> 01:43:17,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It has really nothing to do with Bimani, but it's big news in the gaming world.

1449
01:43:17,979 --> 01:43:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: As most Bimani people are a bunch of big gaming addicts, we thought we'd mention it.

1450
01:43:22,146 --> 01:43:22,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Square and Enix.

1451
01:43:23,869 --> 01:43:26,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Enix Bot Square did this little merger type thing?

1452
01:43:27,132 --> 01:43:29,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that it was a merger of equals because of their name.

1453
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:30,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a merger of equals.

1454
01:43:30,935 --> 01:43:41,204
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but once I looked at the stuff, I'm going to have to go check the business site to confirm it, but I think that Enix holds a 70-80% share, so it's not a pure merger of equals.

1455
01:43:41,744 --> 01:43:44,566
[SPEAKER_11]: If it was a merger of equals, the ratio would be no more than 10% different.

1456
01:43:45,567 --> 01:43:47,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts on what's going to happen because of this?

1457
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:54,152
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be getting Final Quest Fantasy X with all of the art done by Toriyama.

1458
01:43:54,693 --> 01:43:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Urgits!

1459
01:43:55,433 --> 01:43:55,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Urgits!

1460
01:43:56,154 --> 01:43:57,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I want more Urgits!

1461
01:43:59,155 --> 01:44:00,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, the fighting game, right?

1462
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Air Guys.

1463
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:07,020
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get Air Guys with the Dragon Quest characters.

1464
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:11,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, didn't Enix, weren't they responsible for Buster Groove?

1465
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:30,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Bust a Move Yes, Anex and Metro were responsible for Bust a Move and Bust a Move 2 They're also, you know, I still haven't gotten to play Bust a Move 2001 or whatever the hell it was DDR Bust a Move 2003 with Cloud and Yuffie, oh my god

1466
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't think they're going to be lame and start crossing all their storylines.

1467
01:44:40,042 --> 01:44:47,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think a damn thing's going to change.

1468
01:44:47,606 --> 01:44:48,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Actraiser was the best game ever.

1469
01:44:49,907 --> 01:44:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so moist.

1470
01:44:51,647 --> 01:44:56,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Since, what's his name, Uematsu's not going to do Final Fantasy music anymore, they're phasing him out, they need to get that guy who did Actraiser's music.

1471
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,930
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to get him.

1472
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:59,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be the best thing about this.

1473
01:45:00,151 --> 01:45:05,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually come to think of it, the pre-show disc, I actually have an Overclocked remix of the Fillmore theme.

1474
01:45:07,214 --> 01:45:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, oh yeah, Act Tracer.

1475
01:45:09,235 --> 01:45:19,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Dan and I had a discussion about this, and for anybody who knows me and Dan or has heard me talk about him or us talk,

1476
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:23,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We're both really major gamers.

1477
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:25,986
[SPEAKER_11]: We own like 42 video game systems.

1478
01:45:28,409 --> 01:45:39,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we were having this discussion and we decided that it might be a good thing because I want to catch Annex up to the modern day and teach Square how to be old school again.

1479
01:45:42,689 --> 01:46:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think this is happening for a couple reasons A. Final Fantasy XI fucking tanked in Japan because they fucked it up they completely fucked up that hard drive thing and the online bad idea Final Fantasy Online was a bad idea Square Japan had nothing to do with the movie and the movie was actually good it just shouldn't have been named Final Fantasy B. The movie fucked it up for Square honestly the movie was decent but it wasn't it was not Final Fantasy

1480
01:46:11,719 --> 01:46:14,441
[SPEAKER_03]: They should not have been called Final Fantasy, did not deserve the Final Fantasy name.

1481
01:46:14,461 --> 01:46:16,362
[SPEAKER_11]: As a movie, the movie was good.

1482
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:20,125
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie was good, but it wasn't Final Fantasy.

1483
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:21,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, it wasn't Final Fantasy.

1484
01:46:21,566 --> 01:46:21,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1485
01:46:22,226 --> 01:46:23,527
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say on that.

1486
01:46:23,887 --> 01:46:30,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and this is what I always said, well a friend of mine always talked about this too, because the movie was really being designed about the time the 8 was made.

1487
01:46:31,312 --> 01:46:34,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the movie should have been a game...

1488
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:50,375
[SPEAKER_03]: and 8 should have been the movie 8 would have been awesome 8 would have been an excellent movie and it made a horrible game or 10 as the movie but 10, see 10 the thing with Final Fantasy 10 I can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy on a DDR show but hey the thing with Final Fantasy 10

1489
01:46:51,876 --> 01:46:57,362
[SPEAKER_03]: is that the way it's designed is that next generation of movie slash game.

1490
01:46:58,043 --> 01:46:59,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see it as a movie.

1491
01:46:59,184 --> 01:46:59,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cinematic RPG.

1492
01:46:59,985 --> 01:47:01,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a cinematic RPG.

1493
01:47:01,907 --> 01:47:05,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have liked if they created a movie that's kind of a cross between 7 and 10.

1494
01:47:06,171 --> 01:47:10,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 7 had really cool futuristic worlds and all the machines and stuff.

1495
01:47:10,816 --> 01:47:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 10 had that really kick-ass stuff in it too.

1496
01:47:13,839 --> 01:47:14,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I love...

1497
01:47:14,801 --> 01:47:18,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that one song, Otherworld, that's in the very beginning.

1498
01:47:18,747 --> 01:47:21,352
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the heavy metal music that's in it.

1499
01:47:21,452 --> 01:47:22,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking awesome.

1500
01:47:22,974 --> 01:47:23,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that song.

1501
01:47:24,508 --> 01:47:38,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, one thing, I was reading an interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who was like the best artist in the world, who did all of the original character designs for the first Final Fantasy games, you know, 1 through 6.

1502
01:47:39,756 --> 01:47:42,797
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't do any of the character designs for 7 or 8.

1503
01:47:43,998 --> 01:47:50,081
[SPEAKER_11]: He did them for 9, but he was very discouraged by the direction that the Final Fantasy series was going in.

1504
01:47:50,601 --> 01:47:51,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1505
01:48:15,505 --> 01:48:19,389
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always for me, them in the Magitek armor walking across the ice plain.

1506
01:48:30,115 --> 01:48:31,636
[SPEAKER_03]: He's teasing me because my voice is cracking.

1507
01:48:31,976 --> 01:48:33,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1508
01:48:34,196 --> 01:48:35,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we just call you Ron Weasley now?

1509
01:48:35,997 --> 01:48:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1510
01:48:36,857 --> 01:48:37,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1511
01:48:37,798 --> 01:48:38,818
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he doesn't have the right name.

1512
01:48:38,858 --> 01:48:39,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1513
01:48:39,838 --> 01:48:40,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1514
01:48:40,198 --> 01:48:42,279
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just put you in a Ford and have you drive around.

1515
01:48:42,499 --> 01:48:45,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Final Fantasy, why don't we get to this week's cage match, shall we?

1516
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless anything else... Cage match!

1517
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:50,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have something to say about Square, Enix, merging?

1518
01:48:51,402 --> 01:48:52,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone really give a shit?

1519
01:48:52,703 --> 01:48:53,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit, personally.

1520
01:48:53,723 --> 01:48:55,344
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple comments ago, you said something about it.

1521
01:48:55,484 --> 01:48:56,784
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy.

1522
01:48:56,824 --> 01:48:58,865
[SPEAKER_21]: I can make a... I can make a... What is it?

1523
01:48:58,885 --> 01:48:59,045
[SPEAKER_21]: The...

1524
01:49:00,717 --> 01:49:02,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Kevin Bacon thing, Six Degrees, or whatever.

1525
01:49:02,799 --> 01:49:04,681
[SPEAKER_21]: It's probably going to be made by Squaresoft.

1526
01:49:04,701 --> 01:49:06,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Squaresoft made a game called Brave Fenster Musashi.

1527
01:49:06,663 --> 01:49:12,249
[SPEAKER_21]: At the end of Brave Fenster Musashi, there's a music dance game that's pretty much like DDR, but it's, yeah, actually it's like Simon Says.

1528
01:49:12,289 --> 01:49:12,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1529
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:13,310
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, yep.

1530
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:15,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I've got to play that game now.

1531
01:49:15,993 --> 01:49:21,598
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a DDR mode in SNK versus Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

1532
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:23,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not Squaresoft.

1533
01:49:24,132 --> 01:49:24,572
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's DDR.

1534
01:49:24,592 --> 01:49:27,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything goes back to Konami.

1535
01:49:27,573 --> 01:49:32,435
[SPEAKER_03]: On a total different tangent here, the chatroom is now trying to put us all with Harry Potter characters.

1536
01:49:32,495 --> 01:49:33,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're now Hermione.

1537
01:49:33,256 --> 01:49:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I would not be Hermione, hello?

1538
01:49:36,617 --> 01:49:41,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, because first of all, with every damn sorting test I've ever taken, I always come up Slytherin.

1539
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,280
[SPEAKER_03]: She's Draco, because she's evil.

1540
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:44,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not that bad.

1541
01:49:45,101 --> 01:49:47,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess that leaves Loki to be Harry Potter.

1542
01:49:48,202 --> 01:49:48,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the glasses!

1543
01:49:50,851 --> 01:49:52,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I have glasses and I don't look like Harry Potter.

1544
01:49:52,292 --> 01:49:53,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, I've got makeup somewhere.

1545
01:49:53,052 --> 01:49:54,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We can draw, like, a little lightning scar on his head.

1546
01:49:55,193 --> 01:49:56,333
I'm not gonna be pansy.

1547
01:49:56,413 --> 01:49:56,694
Hello.

1548
01:49:56,714 --> 01:49:57,034
Sucks.

1549
01:50:02,945 --> 01:50:05,067
[SPEAKER_03]: April Fool's Day

1550
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We could all be having the wool pulled over our eyes on this.

1551
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I don't think it's really going to matter anyway.

1552
01:50:30,612 --> 01:50:31,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?

1553
01:50:31,092 --> 01:50:31,613
[SPEAKER_03]: They merge.

1554
01:50:31,893 --> 01:50:32,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fucking deal.

1555
01:50:33,894 --> 01:50:34,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1556
01:50:35,234 --> 01:50:35,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Next.

1557
01:50:36,435 --> 01:50:36,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

1558
01:50:37,376 --> 01:50:39,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody accepts this finishing position.

1559
01:50:39,136 --> 01:50:43,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn on the amp here because I need some in-studio sound to deal with this.

1560
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:46,260
[SPEAKER_03]: We apologize for the humming again.

1561
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:47,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what's causing it.

1562
01:50:47,341 --> 01:50:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a hammer to the computer after the show and figure out what's going on.

1563
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:52,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So we apologize.

1564
01:50:53,004 --> 01:50:53,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something to do with the mics.

1565
01:50:53,884 --> 01:50:54,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe our mics are just cheap.

1566
01:50:55,025 --> 01:50:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1567
01:50:56,078 --> 01:50:56,419
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1568
01:51:14,102 --> 01:51:18,126
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play a couple songs all the way through, and then we're going to review them.

1569
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:20,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we're just going to play a clip.

1570
01:51:20,168 --> 01:51:24,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote for last week's winner, but we're only going to play a small clip of it.

1571
01:51:24,151 --> 01:51:31,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you all have been listening to our Bomani Music Amore program, airing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're not on, and you've heard it already, right?

1572
01:51:31,698 --> 01:51:31,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1573
01:51:31,978 --> 01:51:32,939
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to play it all again.

1574
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:37,902
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to give our opinions on the songs again.

1575
01:51:37,922 --> 01:51:40,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the new one's going to be played all the way through.

1576
01:51:40,664 --> 01:51:45,246
[SPEAKER_11]: You, as the chat room, get to decide which one of these is going to be our next big thing.

1577
01:51:45,426 --> 01:51:49,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so the winner of the cage match will be put into rotation on the normal Bimani Music and More program this week.

1578
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:50,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to vote for a winner.

1579
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:53,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you can vote for last week's victor.

1580
01:51:54,811 --> 01:51:57,333
[SPEAKER_03]: But once last week's winner wins what?

1581
01:51:57,413 --> 01:51:58,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the song wins what?

1582
01:51:58,353 --> 01:52:00,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, four weeks, we retire it and it can't win anymore.

1583
01:52:01,095 --> 01:52:01,535
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we think?

1584
01:52:01,575 --> 01:52:01,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Four weeks?

1585
01:52:02,796 --> 01:52:02,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Three?

1586
01:52:05,523 --> 01:52:05,983
[SPEAKER_11]: We give it a month.

1587
01:52:06,243 --> 01:52:06,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We give it a month.

1588
01:52:06,904 --> 01:52:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so four weeks.

1589
01:52:07,744 --> 01:52:09,845
[SPEAKER_03]: If a song wins for four weeks, it gets retired.

1590
01:52:11,025 --> 01:52:12,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, then it goes in permanently.

1591
01:52:12,366 --> 01:52:18,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is our winner from last week was the Final Fantasy Music DJ.

1592
01:52:18,928 --> 01:52:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an overclocked remix of... I'm sorry, yes, Loki, would you like to explain last week's feature?

1593
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a remix from Final Fantasy 7.

1594
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:26,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the...

1595
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:52,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was last week's Victor, the Coral Prison remix theme.

1596
01:52:52,812 --> 01:52:55,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an overclocked remix by FFMusicDJ.

1597
01:52:55,653 --> 01:52:58,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can vote for that, or you can vote for something new!

1598
01:53:00,154 --> 01:53:00,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's new!

1599
01:53:01,554 --> 01:53:07,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the mix this week we have, this is something from the pre-show, but it's so fucking cool, we're putting it in the cage match.

1600
01:53:07,996 --> 01:53:09,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, please tell us.

1601
01:53:10,377 --> 01:53:14,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking for happy hardcore remakes last night, and I filmed the Knight Rider theme.

1602
01:53:15,194 --> 01:53:15,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Never knows the hair.

1603
01:53:25,629 --> 01:53:28,911
[SPEAKER_11]: David Hasselhoff was just like, in the 80s he was cool.

1604
01:53:29,611 --> 01:53:31,512
[SPEAKER_11]: David Hasselhoff, he's so dreamy.

1605
01:53:31,632 --> 01:53:35,134
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was Baywatch, and he's loved in Germany.

1606
01:53:36,795 --> 01:53:37,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should just play this song.

1607
01:53:38,176 --> 01:53:42,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so the first song, and remember you cannot vote until the second song is finished playing.

1608
01:53:42,778 --> 01:53:46,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to play the first song for you in today's cage match.

1609
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Knight Rider theme from Happy Hardcore.

1610
01:53:49,482 --> 01:53:49,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1611
01:53:53,939 --> 01:53:56,770
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad, it's not from Happy To Be Hardcore, it's just a random mix.

1612
01:53:57,071 --> 01:53:57,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But here it is.

1613
01:56:11,818 --> 01:56:13,941
Thanks for watching!

1614
01:57:05,675 --> 01:57:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the cage match is in effect here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1615
01:57:08,398 --> 01:57:10,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Knight Rider theme.

1616
01:57:10,299 --> 01:57:11,981
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think of that here in the room?

1617
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:12,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

1618
01:57:12,301 --> 01:57:13,462
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn, that was cool.

1619
01:57:13,682 --> 01:57:14,082
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1620
01:57:14,182 --> 01:57:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, what did you think of the Knight Rider theme?

1621
01:57:16,284 --> 01:57:17,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

1622
01:57:17,325 --> 01:57:21,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

1623
01:57:21,168 --> 01:57:21,449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1624
01:57:21,529 --> 01:57:21,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1625
01:57:22,449 --> 01:57:23,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

1626
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:24,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the original theme.

1627
01:57:25,092 --> 01:57:27,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of lost a little bit of it in the middle there.

1628
01:57:28,034 --> 01:57:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the 20s.

1629
01:57:28,495 --> 01:57:28,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the 20s.

1630
01:57:31,997 --> 01:57:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, your thoughts on the Knight Rider mix?

1631
01:57:36,041 --> 01:57:36,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

1632
01:57:37,302 --> 01:57:42,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to say it's cool for about the first minute when that nostalgia kicks in, but three minutes of it is a little bit much.

1633
01:57:42,266 --> 01:57:42,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1634
01:57:43,147 --> 01:57:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.

1635
01:57:44,528 --> 01:57:46,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, on a scale of 1 to 10.

1636
01:57:47,499 --> 01:57:55,422
[SPEAKER_03]: 9, Dave, 8, Loki, 8, Bradley, 7, and I'll give it a 7.5.

1637
01:57:55,922 --> 01:57:58,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so I'm a harsh judge, what can I say?

1638
01:57:58,903 --> 01:58:00,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was the Knight Rider theme.

1639
01:58:00,124 --> 01:58:04,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we got one more song here for the cage match, and I'm going to play that for you right now.

1640
01:58:04,346 --> 01:58:07,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming off a CD, so I don't know how this is going to work.

1641
01:58:07,587 --> 01:58:10,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be a little weird, but Loki, why don't you intro this for me, please?

1642
01:58:10,968 --> 01:58:15,511
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be, it's off of their brand new CD, Community Service.

1643
01:58:15,611 --> 01:58:20,494
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a remix done by Hybrid of the Crystal Method, the name of the game.

1644
01:58:20,554 --> 01:58:22,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Hybrid's LA Blackout remix.

1645
01:58:24,056 --> 01:58:26,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this is the second one in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

1646
01:58:26,498 --> 01:58:28,279
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Crystal Method with the name of the game.

1647
02:03:45,099 --> 02:03:46,160
Call it more friends!

1648
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:20,691
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that was Crystal Method with the name of the game.

1649
02:04:21,231 --> 02:04:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your thoughts on that?

1650
02:04:22,452 --> 02:04:23,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're yawning over there.

1651
02:04:23,392 --> 02:04:25,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little boring to you.

1652
02:04:25,694 --> 02:04:26,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I see.

1653
02:04:26,674 --> 02:04:27,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave, your thoughts?

1654
02:04:28,795 --> 02:04:29,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki had the right idea.

1655
02:04:29,995 --> 02:04:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut it down.

1656
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:31,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shorter time.

1657
02:04:31,996 --> 02:04:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1658
02:04:33,577 --> 02:04:34,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's in the room.

1659
02:04:34,437 --> 02:04:35,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that?

1660
02:04:35,298 --> 02:04:36,378
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get to comment on the last one.

1661
02:04:36,398 --> 02:04:37,319
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of this one?

1662
02:04:37,339 --> 02:04:39,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the original last song has always been my favorite Crystal Method song ever.

1663
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:42,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always said that DC and DX and I would love to do it next as well.

1664
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:44,942
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey, I don't know if I can do it.

1665
02:04:45,022 --> 02:04:46,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I can do it.

1666
02:04:47,303 --> 02:04:49,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what did you think of it?

1667
02:04:49,125 --> 02:04:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the song.

1668
02:04:50,606 --> 02:04:52,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, yes, it was too long.

1669
02:04:52,667 --> 02:04:56,790
[SPEAKER_05]: The original one is also my favorite Christmas song ever.

1670
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:59,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to add, though, that this is my turn.

1671
02:04:59,331 --> 02:05:00,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the perfect pre-entry.

1672
02:05:00,913 --> 02:05:04,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I've cut it down to two and a half minutes.

1673
02:05:05,015 --> 02:05:07,617
[SPEAKER_05]: No longer is it two and a half minutes, but yeah, I like it.

1674
02:05:07,637 --> 02:05:09,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, your thoughts?

1675
02:05:09,698 --> 02:05:11,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been really good at that one.

1676
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:12,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really good at that one.

1677
02:05:13,121 --> 02:05:13,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

1678
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:17,642
[SPEAKER_03]: My thoughts, it's a cool song for a minute and a half.

1679
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:19,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing as the last song.

1680
02:05:19,983 --> 02:05:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: A little long, a little long for me, but I bet it's going to kick a lot of ass in DDR, a DDR edit.

1681
02:05:24,605 --> 02:05:26,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's break it down, scale of 1 to 10.

1682
02:05:26,425 --> 02:05:26,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

1683
02:05:27,726 --> 02:05:32,047
[SPEAKER_11]: It had lots of parts that I liked, and I thought they were good.

1684
02:05:33,488 --> 02:05:34,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it a 6.5.

1685
02:05:34,648 --> 02:05:35,549
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.5 from Jamie.

1686
02:05:35,969 --> 02:05:36,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave?

1687
02:05:37,189 --> 02:05:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, whenever it switched to a new part, then it was cool, but then it kept going on that part for like a minute and a half each.

1688
02:05:44,873 --> 02:05:46,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I'll be generous.

1689
02:05:46,895 --> 02:05:48,075
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it a 7.

1690
02:05:48,115 --> 02:05:48,075
7.

1691
02:05:48,336 --> 02:05:48,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Brad.

1692
02:05:48,736 --> 02:05:51,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Since I didn't hear their whole song, I have to be fair.

1693
02:05:51,278 --> 02:05:53,719
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I can't give it a 10 or anything.

1694
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:58,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it sounded good when I heard it, so I guess I'll give it a 7.

1695
02:05:58,302 --> 02:05:58,262
7.

1696
02:05:59,103 --> 02:05:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1697
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can be biased because it's my song, so I'm giving it a 10.

1698
02:06:02,345 --> 02:06:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, 10.

1699
02:06:03,346 --> 02:06:03,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley.

1700
02:06:03,846 --> 02:06:04,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it a 10.

1701
02:06:06,053 --> 02:06:07,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a 6.5 as well.

1702
02:06:08,774 --> 02:06:09,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there's your votes.

1703
02:06:10,515 --> 02:06:13,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So, now it's time for the important people to vote.

1704
02:06:13,476 --> 02:06:14,556
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you in the chatroom.

1705
02:06:14,616 --> 02:06:17,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me your votes over private message.

1706
02:06:17,837 --> 02:06:22,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your votes over private message to Sky in the chatroom right now and we will reveal the votes.

1707
02:06:22,058 --> 02:06:24,079
[SPEAKER_03]: These, once again, are your choices.

1708
02:06:24,539 --> 02:06:26,700
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote for last week's winner.

1709
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:31,101
[SPEAKER_03]: The Final Fantasy Music DJ with a remix of Choral Prison.

1710
02:06:32,942 --> 02:06:33,582
[SPEAKER_03]: String Machine.

1711
02:06:40,147 --> 02:06:43,268
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote for Happy Hardcore Knight Rider theme.

1712
02:06:45,349 --> 02:06:47,709
Or you can vote for The Crystal Method, the name of the game.

1713
02:07:01,129 --> 02:07:02,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your choices.

1714
02:07:02,989 --> 02:07:05,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your votes in right now.

1715
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:07,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't send them over DCC chat.

1716
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:08,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't accept those during the show.

1717
02:07:08,451 --> 02:07:10,211
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to send them over normal private message.

1718
02:07:11,091 --> 02:07:11,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1719
02:07:12,031 --> 02:07:12,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1720
02:07:12,792 --> 02:07:13,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby.

1721
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:15,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby, you should know better.

1722
02:07:16,132 --> 02:07:16,512
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

1723
02:07:18,633 --> 02:07:18,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee.

1724
02:07:19,673 --> 02:07:22,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who has his own little team should know...

1725
02:07:24,245 --> 02:07:25,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just fucking with him.

1726
02:07:25,307 --> 02:07:27,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving him a hard time because I can.

1727
02:07:27,649 --> 02:07:29,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby likes it when I give him a hard time.

1728
02:07:29,712 --> 02:07:30,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Wink wink, nudge nudge.

1729
02:07:30,913 --> 02:07:33,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Say no more.

1730
02:07:34,477 --> 02:07:37,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll be revealing those votes in a little bit.

1731
02:07:38,602 --> 02:07:40,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along though, we're going to talk about...

1732
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:43,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, our new web forums!

1733
02:07:43,502 --> 02:07:45,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else has new sites and forums.

1734
02:07:45,684 --> 02:07:46,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't we?

1735
02:07:46,464 --> 02:07:47,485
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got new forums.

1736
02:07:47,905 --> 02:07:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and click on forums.

1737
02:07:52,769 --> 02:07:54,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got some brand new forums that you can peruse.

1738
02:07:54,770 --> 02:07:59,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I have to state, though, they're very temporary and they're not the best forums because they're free.

1739
02:08:00,494 --> 02:08:03,957
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not EasyBoard because I fucking hate EasyBoard and I wouldn't use them.

1740
02:08:04,837 --> 02:08:11,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I use somebody else, excellent service, my ICOM board, you know, for somebody just trying to get started with a message board, it's great.

1741
02:08:11,683 --> 02:08:15,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be temporary though until I've got some extra money and can buy another host.

1742
02:08:15,567 --> 02:08:20,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Or somebody is very gracious and donates some space where we can put, you know, a PHP BB or something.

1743
02:08:21,011 --> 02:08:21,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1744
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You should visit that web board.

1745
02:08:27,602 --> 02:08:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, please mention the LiveJournal community.

1746
02:08:29,504 --> 02:08:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always that.

1747
02:08:30,024 --> 02:08:38,510
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, all one word, that is where our LiveJournal community is.

1748
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:39,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Go check it out.

1749
02:08:39,211 --> 02:08:40,712
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very orange.

1750
02:08:41,192 --> 02:08:41,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's very orange.

1751
02:08:42,033 --> 02:08:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very pretty design, though.

1752
02:08:44,214 --> 02:08:48,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank LiveJournal for that.

1753
02:08:48,976 --> 02:08:51,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I just picked a default that was orange.

1754
02:08:51,437 --> 02:08:52,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You just picked a default scheme.

1755
02:08:54,059 --> 02:08:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, let's see, what else can we talk about?

1756
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk about this really fast, if I can get this to bring up.

1757
02:08:59,802 --> 02:09:03,844
[SPEAKER_03]: What's being released, I believe, this week is a good, cool compilation.

1758
02:09:06,842 --> 02:09:15,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's Good Cool Songs, and what they did, something about Santa's redone all the songs in English.

1759
02:09:16,995 --> 02:09:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, at least the preview songs on the website, Santa's singing them and they're in English, and you know what?

1760
02:09:22,384 --> 02:09:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get a quick clip of one of those songs for you right here.

1761
02:09:28,385 --> 02:09:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can get you one of these.

1762
02:09:30,245 --> 02:09:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to hear a quick clip of one of these songs right here.

1763
02:09:32,986 --> 02:09:37,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if we do a dropout real fast, but I want to be able to play this clip for you guys, so here we go.

1764
02:09:37,447 --> 02:09:41,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn on the speaker so you guys in-house can hear it.

1765
02:09:42,587 --> 02:09:43,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if it comes up.

1766
02:09:43,568 --> 02:09:44,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loading right now.

1767
02:09:44,428 --> 02:09:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get a clip of 19 November from the Good Cool album, which comes out on December 4th, so it comes out this week.

1768
02:09:51,029 --> 02:09:51,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

1769
02:09:52,481 --> 02:09:54,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecting, la la la la la.

1770
02:09:54,462 --> 02:09:55,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to connect to the site.

1771
02:09:58,644 --> 02:09:59,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it goes.

1772
02:09:59,385 --> 02:10:01,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a small clip of what this will sound like.

1773
02:10:29,497 --> 02:10:31,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little bit of 19 November.

1774
02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you guys think of that?

1775
02:10:32,498 --> 02:10:33,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it make a CD worth buying?

1776
02:10:34,219 --> 02:10:38,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's good cool since it's worth buying anyway, but, uh... That's English?

1777
02:10:39,161 --> 02:10:39,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1778
02:10:39,821 --> 02:10:45,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I'm gonna get, like, a freaking ass-reaming here for saying this, but they should've got freaking, uh... No!

1779
02:10:45,383 --> 02:10:45,604
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

1780
02:10:45,664 --> 02:10:45,864
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

1781
02:10:45,904 --> 02:10:46,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul and Terry!

1782
02:10:46,904 --> 02:10:47,144
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1783
02:10:47,164 --> 02:10:47,344
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1784
02:10:47,364 --> 02:10:47,704
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

1785
02:10:47,724 --> 02:10:48,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul and Terry!

1786
02:10:49,605 --> 02:10:51,006
That's fine!

1787
02:10:51,346 --> 02:10:52,206
No!

1788
02:10:52,746 --> 02:10:54,307
[SPEAKER_10]: God, leave.

1789
02:10:54,327 --> 02:10:54,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot.

1790
02:10:54,607 --> 02:10:56,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You're banned from Orange Lounge just like Paul and Terry.

1791
02:10:56,708 --> 02:10:56,848
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1792
02:10:57,108 --> 02:10:57,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back, Brad.

1793
02:10:57,768 --> 02:10:58,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back, Brad.

1794
02:10:58,749 --> 02:10:59,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.

1795
02:11:00,219 --> 02:11:01,139
[SPEAKER_07]: We still hate Politary.

1796
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:01,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1797
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Why Politary?

1798
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:03,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1799
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:05,021
[SPEAKER_21]: Because Santa should not be singing in English.

1800
02:11:05,582 --> 02:11:06,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell, Santa should not be singing.

1801
02:11:08,043 --> 02:11:11,184
[SPEAKER_11]: She sings because she did very nicely on the Shining Polaris.

1802
02:11:11,204 --> 02:11:13,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Shining Polaris was good.

1803
02:11:13,485 --> 02:11:13,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1804
02:11:14,426 --> 02:11:15,686
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because LED kicks ass.

1805
02:11:16,346 --> 02:11:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: LED does kick ass.

1806
02:11:17,067 --> 02:11:20,128
[SPEAKER_11]: They should fork out the money and get Utada Hikaru.

1807
02:11:21,009 --> 02:11:21,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Ayumi.

1808
02:11:22,525 --> 02:11:23,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fork out the money.

1809
02:11:24,026 --> 02:11:24,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, hold on.

1810
02:11:24,626 --> 02:11:32,511
[SPEAKER_21]: What's awesome is, I don't know if anybody's played the Game Boy Beatmania games, I know that's pretty ghetto, but they've got some pretty cool licensed tracks on there.

1811
02:11:32,531 --> 02:11:34,132
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have a Utah Bakudo song on there.

1812
02:11:34,172 --> 02:11:37,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I played the one on Wonderspawn that has the digitized music.

1813
02:11:38,915 --> 02:11:41,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I played the Beatmania that was on Wonderspawn.

1814
02:11:41,516 --> 02:11:42,317
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all digitized.

1815
02:11:42,817 --> 02:11:46,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have a Wonderspawn color and the little turntable wouldn't fit on my thing very well.

1816
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Guitar Freaks has to depend on you.

1817
02:11:50,706 --> 02:11:51,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it's not gagged.

1818
02:12:06,394 --> 02:12:08,276
[SPEAKER_03]: No, someone needs to send me that CD for Christmas.

1819
02:12:25,114 --> 02:12:42,160
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody can get, if before Christmas, as soon as it's out, you know, you want to send us over a copy of the album, we'll get some songs in rotation on the normal, yes, if you can get us a picture, we'll get some tracks on Orange Lounge in regular rotation, the good ones, so we'll see.

1820
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:46,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to take a real quick break, we'll be back.

1821
02:12:47,305 --> 02:12:49,267
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're going to talk about this week's list list.

1822
02:12:49,287 --> 02:12:57,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a list list tonight and we'll do that and then we're going to reveal the vote winner, getter, top getter, vote getter.

1823
02:13:00,057 --> 02:13:01,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the winner wins, they win.

1824
02:13:31,204 --> 02:13:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello, it's not playing.

1825
02:13:32,306 --> 02:13:33,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what's going on here.

1826
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:35,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick problem.

1827
02:13:35,992 --> 02:13:36,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a quick issue.

1828
02:13:37,254 --> 02:13:38,596
[SPEAKER_03]: We apologize for the inconvenience.

1829
02:13:39,577 --> 02:13:44,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some issues, and we think the issues are fixed now, so here we go.

1830
02:16:19,511 --> 02:16:20,232
Thank you for watching!

1831
02:18:18,649 --> 02:18:19,928

02:19:06,731 --> 02:19:09,132

[SPEAKER_03]: The Final Fantasy String Machine and the Knight Rider theme.

1835

[SPEAKER_03]: And the winner was, with over half the votes, out of three choices, over half the votes, the winner was... Knight Rider theme, ladies and gentlemen.

1836
02:19:52,216 --> 02:19:53,537
[SPEAKER_22]: David Hasselhoff was cool.

1837
02:19:54,417 --> 02:19:55,057
[SPEAKER_22]: Big difference.

1838
02:19:55,498 --> 02:19:56,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Was cool.

1839
02:19:57,018 --> 02:19:58,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's borderline cool.

02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:00,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great in South Park.

1841

02:20:04,082 --> 02:20:04,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

1844
02:20:05,723 --> 02:20:08,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm being given a link to the DDR Kids machine.

1845
02:20:08,724 --> 02:20:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have a look-see-loo at this.

1846
02:20:13,187 --> 02:20:13,887
[SPEAKER_03]: A look-see-loo.

1847
02:20:14,247 --> 02:20:15,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my voice got a vote.

1848
02:20:16,408 --> 02:20:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: for the cage match winner.

1849
02:20:17,768 --> 02:20:18,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Gumby.

1850
02:20:19,169 --> 02:20:23,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it was Twin that voted for that, but hey.

1851
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:25,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a picture of the Danson's Revolution Kids machine.

1852
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:27,671
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so cheesy.

1853
02:20:27,691 --> 02:20:28,651
[SPEAKER_11]: They were selling one on eBay.

1854
02:20:29,031 --> 02:20:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so cheesy.

1855
02:20:29,751 --> 02:20:30,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember?

1856
02:20:30,271 --> 02:20:31,071
[SPEAKER_11]: They were selling one on eBay.

1857
02:20:31,091 --> 02:20:31,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, they were selling one.

1858
02:20:31,852 --> 02:20:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably how the place got it.

1859
02:20:37,653 --> 02:20:38,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a what, Dave?

1860
02:20:39,433 --> 02:20:41,714
[SPEAKER_04]: A freaky stolen machine, kind of like Mickey Mouse.

1861
02:20:42,859 --> 02:20:44,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you said a sewing machine.

1862
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:45,281
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought you said, yeah.

1863
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:48,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like one of those picture maker things, picture tape.

1864
02:20:49,183 --> 02:20:50,184
Uh, yeah.

1865
02:20:53,166 --> 02:20:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cute.

1866
02:20:54,367 --> 02:20:57,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, is there any other pictures of... No, it just shows all the different kinds of DDR.

1867
02:20:59,490 --> 02:20:59,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1868
02:21:00,271 --> 02:21:00,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

1869
02:21:01,472 --> 02:21:01,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1870
02:21:04,994 --> 02:21:05,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1871
02:21:05,494 --> 02:21:05,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a deer.

1872
02:21:09,286 --> 02:21:10,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Top hits don't count.

1873
02:21:10,287 --> 02:21:11,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Top hits is ass.

1874
02:21:12,787 --> 02:21:13,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid to look at this.

1875
02:21:15,368 --> 02:21:16,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cute.

1876
02:21:16,409 --> 02:21:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cute.

1877
02:21:18,329 --> 02:21:18,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Lovely.

1878
02:21:18,809 --> 02:21:21,210
[SPEAKER_03]: An Orange Lounge boy-on-boy mix signature.

1879
02:21:21,630 --> 02:21:21,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

1880
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I like boy-on-boy action.

1881
02:21:22,911 --> 02:21:23,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

1882
02:21:25,712 --> 02:21:27,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, you gotta love the intelligence of our listeners.

1883
02:21:29,513 --> 02:21:30,433
[SPEAKER_03]: That was twin, of course.

1884
02:21:30,793 --> 02:21:33,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Who sends all the shocking weird shit?

1885
02:21:37,449 --> 02:21:41,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, who sends the funny, good, shocking, weird shit?

1886
02:21:41,550 --> 02:21:44,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like what, Pyroman and the OSVB send that stuff.

1887
02:21:44,691 --> 02:21:48,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Who sends the shocking, weird shit that really is shocking and weird?

1888
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Twin.

1889
02:21:49,412 --> 02:21:49,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1890
02:21:50,092 --> 02:21:50,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1891
02:21:50,432 --> 02:21:53,773
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that we should move right along to our next game show.

1892
02:21:54,053 --> 02:21:56,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should move right into our next game show.

1893
02:21:56,613 --> 02:21:59,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to first back this up with a story.

1894
02:21:59,834 --> 02:22:02,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to talk about this a little bit because it's the holidays.

1895
02:22:02,595 --> 02:22:03,495
[SPEAKER_03]: A story.

1896
02:22:03,575 --> 02:22:03,975
[SPEAKER_03]: A story.

1897
02:22:04,635 --> 02:22:07,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta find this story.

1898
02:22:08,539 --> 02:22:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm logged into the wrong account right now.

1899
02:22:10,141 --> 02:22:11,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be able to pull up the story.

1900
02:22:11,222 --> 02:22:11,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1901
02:22:11,903 --> 02:22:13,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, tell a story about your day or something.

1902
02:22:13,525 --> 02:22:14,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I need time to fill here.

1903
02:22:15,607 --> 02:22:17,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I did laundry today, Rob.

1904
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:20,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I washed my pants.

1905
02:22:20,592 --> 02:22:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: A clean DDR is a fun DDR and a happy DDR.

1906
02:22:23,575 --> 02:22:23,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1907
02:22:27,991 --> 02:22:42,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Kingdom Hearts, and then I played Max USA, and I don't know, it's so stupid how you have to play all these songs, because I've already done everything there is to do right now, and I've got nothing left to do except try to unlock songs.

1908
02:22:43,029 --> 02:22:48,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, Dazley Never, because they ended with getting hit in the head with a weasel.

1909
02:22:49,864 --> 02:22:51,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, he lit the menorah, too, right?

1910
02:22:53,427 --> 02:22:54,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I do that when I get back.

1911
02:22:54,528 --> 02:22:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do that when you get back.

1912
02:22:56,509 --> 02:22:57,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge comes first.

1913
02:22:57,590 --> 02:22:58,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge always comes.

1914
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge is above all holy holidays.

1915
02:23:01,473 --> 02:23:04,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen Rob Schneider as a gigolo.

1916
02:23:04,535 --> 02:23:07,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen Rob Schneider as a woman.

1917
02:23:07,457 --> 02:23:10,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, see Rob Schneider as a stapler.

1918
02:23:13,222 --> 02:23:13,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, crap.

1919
02:23:15,226 --> 02:23:19,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being given some interesting stuff, and this is coming from Gumby.

1920
02:23:19,907 --> 02:23:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know this is going to be weird.

1921
02:23:21,188 --> 02:23:23,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1922
02:23:24,989 --> 02:23:30,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby is sending me an article on... Good scene.

1923
02:23:30,491 --> 02:23:33,932
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Gatsas in the title, which sounds like, I don't know, it's not loading.

1924
02:23:36,072 --> 02:23:37,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Gumby, thy link is broken.

1925
02:23:37,393 --> 02:23:37,833
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

1926
02:23:37,853 --> 02:23:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

1927
02:23:41,613 --> 02:23:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just because we're trying to broadcast a show and we can't see it right now.

1928
02:23:44,234 --> 02:23:44,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1929
02:23:44,674 --> 02:23:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just following random links that the chatroom's sending me.

1930
02:23:46,794 --> 02:23:47,534
[SPEAKER_03]: This is scary.

1931
02:23:49,335 --> 02:23:50,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cute.

1932
02:23:50,475 --> 02:23:51,615
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cute.

1933
02:23:52,475 --> 02:23:58,537
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me a picture of Counter-Strike where somebody's got little red octane dance pads there and they give 100 health, apparently.

1934
02:23:59,197 --> 02:24:00,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they take 100 health, more likely.

1935
02:24:01,878 --> 02:24:03,458
[SPEAKER_03]: They also take 100 intelligence.

1936
02:24:07,482 --> 02:24:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, kill me.

1937
02:24:08,862 --> 02:24:12,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I, let's see, I need to find this news article I was looking for, my bad.

1938
02:24:14,824 --> 02:24:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, tell us about your day.

1939
02:24:18,104 --> 02:24:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was over, you know, I was over here at 4 a.m.

1940
02:24:20,905 --> 02:24:23,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend you don't know and tell me again.

1941
02:24:25,306 --> 02:24:25,586
Fuck you.

1942
02:24:25,826 --> 02:24:27,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I was over here at 4 a.m.

1943
02:24:27,767 --> 02:24:28,907
[SPEAKER_21]: playing your Animal Crossing.

1944
02:24:28,927 --> 02:24:31,147
[SPEAKER_21]: We left, we went to bed, we woke up at 1 p.m.

1945
02:24:31,527 --> 02:24:34,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we have lives, and we came over here and played more.

1946
02:24:36,215 --> 02:24:37,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, how was your day?

1947
02:24:37,536 --> 02:24:39,478
[SPEAKER_03]: My day was fabulous, thank you for asking.

1948
02:24:39,638 --> 02:24:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't told us.

1949
02:24:40,739 --> 02:24:43,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the link up that I wanted, thank you.

1950
02:24:43,621 --> 02:24:47,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, we're going to talk about, because the day... Rob got it up.

1951
02:24:48,185 --> 02:24:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1952
02:24:49,126 --> 02:24:49,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1953
02:24:49,606 --> 02:24:50,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the show too.

1954
02:24:50,867 --> 02:24:52,288
[SPEAKER_03]: You woman... anyway.

1955
02:24:52,989 --> 02:24:53,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, hello.

1956
02:24:54,610 --> 02:24:58,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play your Grand Theft Auto woman mix in your Miata and your VW Bug.

1957
02:25:01,812 --> 02:25:11,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullshit, I'd have the terrain of... Anyway, we want to talk about the day after Thanksgiving is commonly known as the Oh Fuck Stay Away From The Mall Day.

1958
02:25:12,135 --> 02:25:13,556
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words... Black Friday.

1959
02:25:13,676 --> 02:25:14,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Friday.

1960
02:25:14,956 --> 02:25:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Friday.

1961
02:25:17,037 --> 02:25:21,878
[SPEAKER_03]: The day when you do not want to be caught dead anywhere near a mall because it's that time of year to go shopping.

1962
02:25:21,998 --> 02:25:22,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the mall.

1963
02:25:22,858 --> 02:25:28,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, every year they release the list of the top holiday toys.

1964
02:25:28,980 --> 02:25:30,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought they've compiled a list.

1965
02:25:30,641 --> 02:25:34,622
[SPEAKER_03]: This station, WESH, I have no idea where they're located.

1966
02:25:35,682 --> 02:25:36,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

1967
02:25:36,462 --> 02:25:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter where they're located.

1968
02:25:38,003 --> 02:25:39,403
[SPEAKER_03]: They're W, so they're East Coast.

1969
02:25:39,824 --> 02:25:40,844
[SPEAKER_03]: They're somewhere East Coast.

1970
02:25:41,384 --> 02:25:43,705
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stating it's a great time to start your Christmas shopping.

1971
02:25:43,745 --> 02:25:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You can beat the rush and the shelves are stocked.

1972
02:25:45,685 --> 02:25:47,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's going to be popular this year?

1973
02:25:47,646 --> 02:25:48,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how kids are in general.

1974
02:25:48,966 --> 02:25:51,287
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care how much a toy costs or who makes it.

1975
02:25:51,627 --> 02:25:52,607
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to have fun.

1976
02:25:53,048 --> 02:25:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So Yahoo site for kids, Yahooligans, gave kids a chance to vote for toys on their wish list.

1977
02:25:58,369 --> 02:26:02,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the top five toys that kids are looking for for Christmas this year.

1978
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:08,992
[SPEAKER_03]: The number five, this is amazing to me, the number five toy, Singing Stars Video Karaoke.

1979
02:26:11,067 --> 02:26:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows kids to become the next superstar.

1980
02:26:13,688 --> 02:26:15,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a $100 karaoke machine.

1981
02:26:15,928 --> 02:26:18,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like American Idol, except that you don't have to get bitched at.

1982
02:26:18,829 --> 02:26:19,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be the add-on.

1983
02:26:20,270 --> 02:26:23,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, get a little British guy to bitch at you and yell and tell you that you're no good.

1984
02:26:23,911 --> 02:26:27,832
[SPEAKER_05]: The future generation of single, old people.

1985
02:26:27,852 --> 02:26:28,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Come over to my house, I'll bitch at you.

1986
02:26:28,992 --> 02:26:35,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Drunken, in a bar, singing drunken music from times when they remember they were young.

1987
02:26:36,174 --> 02:26:36,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1988
02:26:37,366 --> 02:26:38,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna be high on pixie sticks.

1989
02:26:39,947 --> 02:26:41,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I weep for the future.

[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along, the number four Christmas toy.

02:26:47,949 --> 02:26:49,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Trading Card Game.

1993
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:51,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I cry for America.

1994
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the concept of this whole Yu-Gi-Oh!

1995
02:26:55,051 --> 02:26:55,971
[SPEAKER_05]: thing is just shit.

1996
02:26:56,712 --> 02:26:55,971
1991.

1997
02:26:57,612 --> 02:27:04,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Card games are cool, people just love watching card games, they don't like participating in card games, but watching them are really fun.

1998
02:27:05,396 --> 02:27:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when little holographic things happen.

1999
02:27:09,321 --> 02:27:09,461
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2000
02:27:09,481 --> 02:27:09,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap.

2001
02:27:09,962 --> 02:27:13,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

2002
02:27:13,045 --> 02:27:14,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to mention the thing came out in 1991.

2003
02:27:14,467 --> 02:27:14,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Crap.

2004
02:27:14,948 --> 02:27:15,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And crap.

2005
02:27:21,201 --> 02:27:24,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that was the number four holiday toy this year.

2006
02:27:24,383 --> 02:27:25,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2007
02:27:25,704 --> 02:27:27,845

2010
02:27:37,471 --> 02:27:39,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the website says.

2011
02:27:39,572 --> 02:27:41,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe everything I read online, so.

2012
02:27:42,434 --> 02:27:43,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the next one.

2013
02:27:43,514 --> 02:27:44,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next one.

2014
02:27:45,336 --> 02:27:47,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, why don't you tell us what the number three Christmas toy is this year?

2015
02:27:48,277 --> 02:27:49,057

02:27:53,498 --> 02:27:55,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a live journal.

2019
02:27:55,438 --> 02:27:56,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a live journal.

2020
02:27:56,339 --> 02:28:00,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your kids online and teach them how to type so they can be good little sexertaries when they get older.

2021
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Sexertaries.

2022
02:28:04,841 --> 02:28:05,821
[SPEAKER_03]: A password journal.

2023
02:28:05,861 --> 02:28:06,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a password journal.

2024
02:28:07,021 --> 02:28:09,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Password Journal 2 is the number three toy.

2025
02:28:12,725 --> 02:28:15,967
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's the Password Journal 2, not 2DX, it's just the Password Journal 2.

[SPEAKER_03]: The number two Christmas toy this holiday season for little Bratz is the Bratz Funky Fashion Makeover.

[SPEAKER_03]: It's a spin-off of the popular Bratz dolls, and it costs $25.

2028
02:28:27,652 --> 02:28:29,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, those things are stupid.

2029
02:28:29,473 --> 02:28:31,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what the fuck it is.

2030
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:34,575
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom would not let me get gem dolls because she thought that their heads were too big, like crack babies.

2031
02:28:35,575 --> 02:28:37,896
[SPEAKER_11]: These make the gem dolls look tame, okay?

2032
02:28:39,397 --> 02:28:41,338
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the boy ones are kind of cool.

2033
02:28:42,242 --> 02:28:42,662
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2034
02:28:56,972 --> 02:28:57,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

2035
02:28:57,432 --> 02:29:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That totally sounds like something they'd sell in the Castro.

2036
02:29:00,754 --> 02:29:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you mean seriously?

2037
02:29:01,974 --> 02:29:03,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they can't market something like that.

2038
02:29:03,875 --> 02:29:05,016
[SPEAKER_03]: You can in the Castro.

2039
02:29:05,236 --> 02:29:07,457
[SPEAKER_11]: He wore a ring.

2040
02:29:08,097 --> 02:29:11,439
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be like a medallion, a ring around his neck on a chain.

2041
02:29:11,499 --> 02:29:13,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring around the cocky.

2042
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a cock ring.

2043
02:29:17,482 --> 02:29:21,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, was it like magnum size or... I don't know.

2044
02:29:21,083 --> 02:29:21,704
I didn't have one.

2045
02:29:22,064 --> 02:29:23,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Magnum size.

2046
02:29:23,645 --> 02:29:24,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Next!

2047
02:29:24,853 --> 02:29:28,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one toy this holiday season, Jamie, what is it?

2048
02:29:29,055 --> 02:29:30,135
[SPEAKER_11]: A Game Boy Advance.

2049
02:29:30,435 --> 02:29:30,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

2050
02:29:30,976 --> 02:29:35,017
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have to ask what a Game Boy Advance is, then go back and bury your head back in the hole.

2051
02:29:35,277 --> 02:29:39,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, obviously, we here in the room disagree with this list completely.

2052
02:29:39,639 --> 02:29:45,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to give you, during this next listless segment, our top three...

2053
02:29:47,344 --> 02:29:52,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game related things we want for Christmas or we think somebody should have for Christmas.

2054
02:29:53,428 --> 02:29:57,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's our top three video game, video gamers Christmas list.

2055
02:29:58,192 --> 02:29:58,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do that.

2056
02:29:58,812 --> 02:30:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break so we can prepare our list and then we'll be right back.

2057
02:30:01,874 --> 02:30:05,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So listen to some music real fast.

2058
02:30:05,176 --> 02:30:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to keep this really brief because we want to get this done before the show's over.

2059
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:13,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you listen to something from...

2060
02:30:14,119 --> 02:30:15,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and 2DX8style.

2061
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: How about our favorite band?

2062
02:30:18,370 --> 02:30:18,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

2063
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:19,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we took their name.

2064
02:30:20,115 --> 02:30:22,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge from 2DX8style here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2065
02:32:07,242 --> 02:32:08,143
Thanks for watching!

2066
02:33:41,505 --> 02:33:42,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are back.

2067
02:33:42,726 --> 02:33:52,110
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and now we're going to start a little thing we call listless here, and I'm trying to find our listless music, although I don't know if I have it queued up.

2068
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:55,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to substitute a different game show theme because I can't find it.

2069
02:33:55,751 --> 02:33:57,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find it.

2070
02:33:57,492 --> 02:33:58,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember where I put it?

2071
02:33:58,592 --> 02:34:00,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the old pre-show things.

2072
02:34:00,853 --> 02:34:02,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the Press Your Luck theme.

2073
02:34:02,434 --> 02:34:02,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Play that.

2074
02:34:02,954 --> 02:34:04,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to play the Press Your Luck theme.

2075
02:34:04,175 --> 02:34:04,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2076
02:34:06,281 --> 02:34:14,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, list list here, it's the top holiday toys that we want and you should want for Christmas.

2077
02:34:14,244 --> 02:34:18,746
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the way it works, for those of you that haven't sat in on a list list segment before, because we have some new listeners tonight.

2078
02:34:19,487 --> 02:34:23,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to give all of our, in the room, our top three items.

2079
02:34:24,088 --> 02:34:28,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to go around the room and take, each of us will take one item off of the list.

2080
02:34:28,970 --> 02:34:32,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be hard, because we're going to be crushing someone's Christmas dream right there.

2081
02:34:32,432 --> 02:34:34,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very difficult tonight, very painful.

2082
02:34:37,649 --> 02:34:40,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll just eliminate all Lokis like we do every week.

2083
02:34:41,212 --> 02:34:44,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once that's done, you guys will vote on the final list.

2084
02:34:44,075 --> 02:34:48,439
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll take your vote and you'll vote on what from that list is your most desired holiday toy.

2085
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:50,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game related.

2086
02:34:50,976 --> 02:34:52,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be new, no.

2087
02:34:52,417 --> 02:34:54,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what you want this holiday season.

2088
02:34:54,158 --> 02:34:56,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody will be able to afford my Christmas.

2089
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:56,981
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2090
02:34:57,421 --> 02:35:02,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what you want this holiday season, and the thing that everybody should want this holiday season, because you said so, and you're God.

2091
02:35:03,365 --> 02:35:03,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2092
02:35:04,226 --> 02:35:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddess.

2093
02:35:05,087 --> 02:35:05,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddess.

2094
02:35:06,688 --> 02:35:11,892
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and then the chat room votes on the top three, and that's it.

2095
02:35:12,892 --> 02:35:13,813
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the list.

2096
02:35:14,013 --> 02:35:16,675
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no other list.

2097
02:35:16,955 --> 02:35:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2098
02:35:18,717 --> 02:35:20,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with Loki.

2099
02:35:21,255 --> 02:35:24,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us your number three pick for the must-have Christmas toy for Loki this season.

2100
02:35:24,896 --> 02:35:29,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I won't say this, but I don't have it this season anymore, and I don't want it.

2101
02:35:30,558 --> 02:35:31,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Power Glove!

2102
02:35:32,058 --> 02:35:33,639
[SPEAKER_21]: The Power Glove!

2103
02:35:34,599 --> 02:35:38,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the Power Glove.

2104
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:40,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki says everybody... Keep the Power Glove off her.

2105
02:35:41,221 --> 02:35:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Boys and girls everywhere need the Power Glove.

2106
02:35:47,032 --> 02:35:49,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

2107
02:35:49,215 --> 02:35:50,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, you're number three choice.

2108
02:35:50,637 --> 02:35:56,564
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, my number three choice is the PS1 with the combination with the LCD screen.

2109
02:35:57,205 --> 02:36:03,452
[SPEAKER_21]: I want this, I don't have one yet, but I think I want everybody else to get one, so I can mod it for you for a very special price, of course.

2110
02:36:04,413 --> 02:36:06,434
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, a PS1 and LCD screen.

2111
02:36:07,135 --> 02:36:07,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good choice.

2112
02:36:08,235 --> 02:36:08,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave.

2113
02:36:11,377 --> 02:36:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think you said pad, because it's the only actual pad that you can play EDR on.

2114
02:36:16,539 --> 02:36:19,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you've got, like, some crazy mod thing.

2115
02:36:20,681 --> 02:36:22,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, an ignition pad says Dave.

2116
02:36:22,742 --> 02:36:24,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and get my number three pick.

2117
02:36:24,664 --> 02:36:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick this holiday season, what Rob wants, I want the Sims Online.

2118
02:36:30,367 --> 02:36:30,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

2119
02:36:30,967 --> 02:36:37,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you think Animal Crossing is bad, just fucking wait until Sims Online, that's all I have to say.

2120
02:36:37,872 --> 02:36:39,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your number three pick.

2121
02:36:39,453 --> 02:36:41,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the PC Engine Duo RX.

2122
02:36:43,417 --> 02:36:44,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to explain this.

2123
02:36:44,717 --> 02:36:45,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

2124
02:36:45,117 --> 02:36:48,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I already own a TurboGrafx Duo.

2125
02:36:48,658 --> 02:37:01,761
[SPEAKER_11]: The PC Engine was what TurboGrafx was in Japan, with the advantage of having a DuoRI that has an arcade card built in, so I can actually play my copy of Strider, and, uh, um, Art, uh, not Artifighting 2, it's, uh, I think Roboutville 3.

2126
02:37:03,621 --> 02:37:04,481
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fucking hardcore.

2127
02:37:04,501 --> 02:37:05,902
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's Artifighting 2, it's Artifighting 2.

2128
02:37:06,142 --> 02:37:07,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie, you're so hardcore.

2129
02:37:10,373 --> 02:37:12,654
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing, I can play Sapphire.

2130
02:37:12,694 --> 02:37:19,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Sapphire is such a fabulous game because it's one of the first 16-bit games that had real polygons in it.

2131
02:37:19,096 --> 02:37:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, the chatroom's suggesting, by the way, things such as a mail-order bride should be on the list.

2132
02:37:24,118 --> 02:37:28,900
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys have to remember, we're talking video game-related things, so... Video game?

2133
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:30,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think a mail-order bride?

2134
02:37:30,141 --> 02:37:33,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess if you play video games, that's the only way you're ever going to get married, is by ordering one.

2135
02:37:34,528 --> 02:37:38,649
[SPEAKER_21]: No, they can sit there and watch me play video games.

2136
02:37:38,689 --> 02:37:40,110
[SPEAKER_21]: Exceptions to every rule.

2137
02:37:40,270 --> 02:37:41,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Exceptions to every rule.

2138
02:37:42,631 --> 02:37:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: ITs, ITs.

2139
02:37:43,551 --> 02:37:44,331
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

2140
02:37:44,611 --> 02:37:45,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two choice.

2141
02:37:46,072 --> 02:37:57,535
[SPEAKER_05]: My number two choice, I was going to go with now the... It has the hidden cameras in the center square there, but... And I decided, no, probably shouldn't do that because I'd have no use for them.

2142
02:37:57,775 --> 02:38:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I decided to go with the official Konami metal stages.

2143
02:38:02,777 --> 02:38:03,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them.

2144
02:38:06,212 --> 02:38:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Every boy and girl wants a Konami Metal stage.

2145
02:38:08,775 --> 02:38:10,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along, Brad.

2146
02:38:11,037 --> 02:38:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: A GameCube with Animal Crossing.

2147
02:38:12,739 --> 02:38:12,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt?

2148
02:38:20,516 --> 02:38:22,318
[SPEAKER_21]: It didn't happen to me with GameCube and Animal Crossing.

2149
02:38:22,378 --> 02:38:24,840
[SPEAKER_21]: It happened to me with the Sega CD and Eternal Champions.

2150
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardcore.

2151
02:38:51,104 --> 02:38:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Dave, your number two choice.

2152
02:38:54,672 --> 02:38:57,017
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two choice is a DD Rex machine.

2153
02:38:58,829 --> 02:39:00,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, a DDR EX machine?

2154
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:00,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2155
02:39:01,531 --> 02:39:02,051
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

2156
02:39:03,692 --> 02:39:04,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Extreme.

2157
02:39:04,352 --> 02:39:04,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my bad.

2158
02:39:05,233 --> 02:39:06,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know the lingo yet.

2159
02:39:06,554 --> 02:39:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2160
02:39:07,354 --> 02:39:09,395
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not down with it.

2161
02:39:09,575 --> 02:39:11,016
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not jiggy with the lingo.

2162
02:39:11,116 --> 02:39:11,576
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

2163
02:39:11,596 --> 02:39:13,177
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the new Metal Gear, DD Rex.

2164
02:39:13,998 --> 02:39:14,398
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2165
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:20,402
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick for a must-have this holiday season, Kansas City Star on 9.

2166
02:39:20,602 --> 02:39:24,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have to have the broadband, but that's a secret code.

2167
02:39:24,644 --> 02:39:25,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

2168
02:39:25,464 --> 02:39:26,005
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a given.

2169
02:39:29,989 --> 02:39:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your number two pick.

2170
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:31,971
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two pick.

2171
02:39:32,512 --> 02:39:35,436
[SPEAKER_11]: It was almost my number one pick, but I had to think of my priorities.

2172
02:39:36,056 --> 02:39:39,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a Beatmania 2DX Arcade Style Controller.

2173
02:39:40,481 --> 02:39:41,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I had my chance to get one.

2174
02:39:42,284 --> 02:39:43,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to think order, okay?

2175
02:39:43,966 --> 02:39:45,027
[SPEAKER_11]: We had everything together.

2176
02:39:45,267 --> 02:39:46,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Your credit card's not the right kind.

2177
02:39:46,909 --> 02:39:47,930
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't accept it.

2178
02:39:48,271 --> 02:39:49,212
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're canceling your order.

2179
02:39:49,232 --> 02:39:49,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.

2180
02:39:52,348 --> 02:39:54,209
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, coming on down to the number one picks.

2181
02:39:54,229 --> 02:39:56,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your number one must-have gift this holiday season.

2182
02:39:56,730 --> 02:39:59,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, since Dave took mine, I'm going to have to one-up him.

2183
02:39:59,051 --> 02:40:00,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go for a 2DX machine.

2184
02:40:00,232 --> 02:40:00,912
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go with 8th style.

2185
02:40:16,573 --> 02:40:20,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, you will have had to have been extra good this year for Santa to bring you one of those.

2186
02:40:20,398 --> 02:40:22,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really good.

2187
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:23,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Hanukkah Harry in days past.

2188
02:40:24,924 --> 02:40:26,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You stole my number one, that bitch.

2189
02:40:28,536 --> 02:40:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Dave, you're number one must-have this holiday season.

2190
02:40:31,237 --> 02:40:32,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Brad.

2191
02:40:32,077 --> 02:40:33,098
[SPEAKER_03]: What, am I not here?

2192
02:40:33,298 --> 02:40:35,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking right at you, and I called you Dave.

2193
02:40:35,158 --> 02:40:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You make a better door than you do a window.

2194
02:40:37,379 --> 02:40:40,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, mine, you know, this is a little, I'm a little outdated.

2195
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:43,121
[SPEAKER_21]: I want an American PS2, because I've had a JPS2 all along.

2196
02:40:43,181 --> 02:40:45,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a lot of American games to catch up on.

2197
02:40:45,862 --> 02:40:46,503
[SPEAKER_21]: What, Matt?

2198
02:40:46,903 --> 02:40:47,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, take yours back.

2199
02:40:47,903 --> 02:40:48,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can.

2200
02:40:48,703 --> 02:40:49,243
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, fine.

2201
02:40:49,284 --> 02:40:49,604
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

2202
02:40:49,684 --> 02:40:50,344
[SPEAKER_21]: I want a JPS2.

2203
02:40:50,364 --> 02:40:50,944
[SPEAKER_21]: You want a JPS2.

2204
02:40:57,807 --> 02:41:00,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, you say the 2DX machine and we're all set.

2205
02:41:00,967 --> 02:41:03,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, actually, Loki, say the 2DX.

2206
02:41:03,588 --> 02:41:04,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you say 2DX.

2207
02:41:05,089 --> 02:41:09,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I say a JPS-2 with 2DX and the controller.

2208
02:41:11,211 --> 02:41:11,851
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

2209
02:41:13,111 --> 02:41:13,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lord.

2210
02:41:13,731 --> 02:41:14,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

2211
02:41:14,892 --> 02:41:15,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm throwing a memory card.

2212
02:41:16,472 --> 02:41:17,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

2213
02:41:17,153 --> 02:41:18,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have it all worked out now.

2214
02:41:19,853 --> 02:41:21,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my number one pick is...

2215
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:23,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm trendy, so what?

2216
02:41:24,001 --> 02:41:24,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

2217
02:41:24,321 --> 02:41:25,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not doing number one yet, are we?

2218
02:41:26,082 --> 02:41:27,784
[SPEAKER_14]: No, okay, never mind, I'll try that one last.

2219
02:41:28,284 --> 02:41:28,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

2220
02:41:28,904 --> 02:41:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll make it first.

2221
02:41:29,885 --> 02:41:32,407
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, this time you go last.

2222
02:41:32,547 --> 02:41:33,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2223
02:41:33,687 --> 02:41:36,209
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one pick, yes, I'm trendy, fuck you, Metroid Prime.

2224
02:41:36,449 --> 02:41:37,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I have that game.

2225
02:41:39,391 --> 02:41:40,112
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty.

2226
02:41:40,492 --> 02:41:42,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I hate first person shooters, but this game is fabulous.

2227
02:41:42,974 --> 02:41:43,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2228
02:41:50,939 --> 02:41:52,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, your number one pick, please.

2229
02:41:52,941 --> 02:41:54,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Unofficial Konami Drum Mania controller, Richard.

2230
02:41:55,463 --> 02:41:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Drum Mania.

2231
02:41:57,484 --> 02:42:02,428
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I have every other controller except the damn Drum Mania controller.

2232
02:42:02,528 --> 02:42:05,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't have a top of music controller, but I'm not as hyper about that.

2233
02:42:08,293 --> 02:42:08,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2234
02:42:08,753 --> 02:42:13,217
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get drum controllers if you know where to look, but I need a Drum Mania controller.

2235
02:42:13,514 --> 02:42:14,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the list so far.

2236
02:42:15,039 --> 02:42:17,529
[SPEAKER_03]: A Power Glove, a PS1 LCD screen...

2237
02:42:18,326 --> 02:42:33,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Ignition Pad, The Sims Online, a PC Engine Duo RX, Konami Metal Stages, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, DDR EX, Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX Arcade Controller, Japanese PS2, American PS2, a 2DX Machine, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania Controller and Drum Mania.

2238
02:42:34,614 --> 02:42:35,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2239
02:42:35,635 --> 02:42:42,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how we're going to possibly do the elimination round, but... Oh well, Christmases are about to be ruined here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2240
02:42:43,018 --> 02:42:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how people are expecting to pay for all this shit.

2241
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like...

2242
02:42:47,236 --> 02:42:48,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything that I picked is in excess of $200.

2243
02:42:49,218 --> 02:42:55,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, I guess you're going to vote for the thing you least would want to see under your tree.

2244
02:42:55,504 --> 02:42:59,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how you're going to make a selection here, but just fucking do it.

2245
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:03,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your menorah, as the case may be.

2246
02:43:03,933 --> 02:43:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, in the back in the peanut gallery, Neal's asking... Don't you get eight days of presents, so...

2247
02:43:11,130 --> 02:43:14,152
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, you get, like, your 2DX machine in pieces.

2248
02:43:14,492 --> 02:43:15,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the monitor!

2249
02:43:15,873 --> 02:43:16,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the key!

2250
02:43:17,854 --> 02:43:19,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I got fucking gypped this Hanukkah.

2251
02:43:19,755 --> 02:43:21,256
[SPEAKER_04]: All I got was DDR Max.

2252
02:43:21,696 --> 02:43:29,401
[SPEAKER_04]: But, hopefully, because, like, my birthday comes, like, a day after Christmas, so normally they make up for it with better shit on my birthday.

2253
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:31,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got your priorities in order, you know.

2254
02:43:32,863 --> 02:43:33,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Good little Jewish boy.

2255
02:43:33,623 --> 02:43:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you talking about?

2256
02:43:36,785 --> 02:43:38,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas and Hanukkah are all about presents.

2257
02:43:39,813 --> 02:43:42,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're about... Yeah, present.

2258
02:43:42,094 --> 02:43:43,975
[SPEAKER_03]: They're about Jesus or not.

2259
02:43:45,996 --> 02:43:46,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

2260
02:43:48,737 --> 02:43:49,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we finish?

2261
02:43:49,578 --> 02:43:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we finish?

2262
02:43:50,198 --> 02:43:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we finish?

2263
02:43:50,798 --> 02:43:51,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2264
02:43:51,979 --> 02:43:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2265
02:43:52,579 --> 02:43:55,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, take... Ruin someone's Christmas right now.

2266
02:43:56,141 --> 02:43:57,481
[SPEAKER_03]: What don't you want for Christmas?

2267
02:43:58,682 --> 02:44:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since I don't play it at all, 2DX Machine.

2268
02:44:03,364 --> 02:44:04,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 2DX Machine.

2269
02:44:05,285 --> 02:44:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Going straight for the gut.

2270
02:44:06,766 --> 02:44:09,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go play one at Scandia when it arrives.

2271
02:44:10,014 --> 02:44:12,176
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to play one at Scandia whenever it arrives.

2272
02:44:12,236 --> 02:44:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Brad.

2273
02:44:13,798 --> 02:44:16,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for you to ruin Christmas and Hanukkah for somebody.

2274
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:17,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Just for that, Matt.

2275
02:44:17,541 --> 02:44:18,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Power Glove.

2276
02:44:18,262 --> 02:44:18,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Say goodbye.

2277
02:44:19,163 --> 02:44:19,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

2278
02:44:19,743 --> 02:44:20,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, you didn't.

2279
02:44:20,844 --> 02:44:23,186
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you did not take out the Power Glove.

2280
02:44:23,226 --> 02:44:26,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the Power Glove, and it sucks.

2281
02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:29,813
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room will have your head for that, Brad.

2282
02:44:29,973 --> 02:44:30,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2283
02:44:30,733 --> 02:44:31,094
[SPEAKER_03]: My turn?

2284
02:44:31,194 --> 02:44:31,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave's turn.

2285
02:44:31,895 --> 02:44:32,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Stages.

2286
02:44:33,056 --> 02:44:34,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Stages.

2287
02:44:34,437 --> 02:44:35,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, Loki.

2288
02:44:38,408 --> 02:44:39,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell was that?

2289
02:44:39,068 --> 02:44:40,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, the Konami Metal Stages.

2290
02:44:40,230 --> 02:44:40,530
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

2291
02:44:41,772 --> 02:44:42,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2292
02:44:43,093 --> 02:44:49,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I would purposely go after you and take off the JPS2, but that was my number two choice.

2293
02:44:51,383 --> 02:44:51,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

2294
02:44:51,983 --> 02:44:53,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That was going to be one of my choices.

2295
02:44:53,565 --> 02:44:55,868
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one to come off the list...

2296
02:44:59,198 --> 02:45:11,044
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm going to take off the PS1 LCD screen because I'm taking that off because the PS1 is so last year.

2297
02:45:11,424 --> 02:45:12,205
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2298
02:45:12,845 --> 02:45:17,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at this list and I own probably most of the stuff that's on it already.

2299
02:45:18,748 --> 02:45:21,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't own an EX machine.

2300
02:45:23,286 --> 02:45:24,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I said most of this stuff, not all of it.

2301
02:45:24,987 --> 02:45:29,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have a JPS2, an American PS2, a Metroid Prime, and a GameCube and Animal Crossing.

2302
02:45:30,971 --> 02:45:31,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Toot the little horn.

2303
02:45:32,932 --> 02:45:35,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually have a beta of Sims Online.

2304
02:45:38,276 --> 02:45:39,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take off.

2305
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:44,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I prefer not to be lagged, thank you.

2306
02:45:59,875 --> 02:46:02,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, why don't you read off the final list here?

2307
02:46:02,476 --> 02:46:07,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, I've got to make sure this is copied right and not some porn site or something is going to post all over the chat room.

2308
02:46:07,558 --> 02:46:08,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to make sure.

2309
02:46:08,578 --> 02:46:09,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't hide porn.

2310
02:46:10,178 --> 02:46:13,840
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, why don't you read off this list, Jamie, and they can vote for it right now in the chat room.

2311
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:17,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, pimp tricks are for hoes.

2312
02:46:17,221 --> 02:46:20,122
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX.

2313
02:46:20,522 --> 02:46:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that stay?

2314
02:46:22,402 --> 02:46:24,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's the coolest video game system ever.

2315
02:46:25,403 --> 02:46:27,464
[SPEAKER_11]: You can play Dracula X on it, okay?

2316
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube with Animal Crossing, DDR Extreme, Phantasy Star Online, and of course you have to have the adapter with it, 2DX Arcade style controller, it would help find connections.

2317
02:46:38,515 --> 02:46:40,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

2318
02:46:40,156 --> 02:46:46,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Japanese PS2, American PS2, Metroid Prime, and Drummedia controller with Drummedia.

2319
02:46:46,479 --> 02:46:47,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Fabulous.

2320
02:46:47,759 --> 02:46:51,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a quick music break while you guys send in your votes.

2321
02:46:51,401 --> 02:46:54,023
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only going to have like two minutes to send me your votes, so do it now.

2322
02:46:54,083 --> 02:46:54,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now, now!

2323
02:46:55,501 --> 02:46:58,184
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send them in over email as well, but hurry up and do it now.

2324
02:46:58,404 --> 02:47:01,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote for your favorite, and we will be right back.

2325
02:47:01,487 --> 02:47:04,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

2326
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:04,330
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2327
02:47:05,351 --> 02:47:05,751
[SPEAKER_03]: The bump?

2328
02:47:05,811 --> 02:47:06,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have the bump queued up.

2329
02:47:06,892 --> 02:47:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2330
02:47:08,774 --> 02:47:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: How about something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania?

2331
02:47:10,356 --> 02:47:11,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Something there?

2332
02:47:11,316 --> 02:47:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Catch your eye?

2333
02:47:11,817 --> 02:47:12,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Monkey Magic.

2334
02:47:12,878 --> 02:47:13,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Monkey Magic.

2335
02:47:14,059 --> 02:47:15,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll hear Kachaka.

2336
02:47:15,801 --> 02:47:16,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll come right back.

2337
02:47:16,942 --> 02:47:19,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gives you two minutes to vote here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2338
02:47:37,781 --> 02:47:38,382
Thank you.

2339
02:47:38,422 --> 02:47:39,222
Thank you.

2340
02:47:39,242 --> 02:47:39,663
Thank you.

2341
02:48:07,825 --> 02:48:09,127
Thanks for watching!

2342
02:48:26,039 --> 02:48:45,729
[SPEAKER_14]: All sun and egg on the mountain top The monkey is monkey that ever spoke He knew every magic trick under the sun To tease the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic

2343
02:48:55,357 --> 02:48:57,738
Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic

2344
02:50:39,110 --> 02:50:44,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2345
02:50:45,275 --> 02:50:47,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2346
02:50:47,516 --> 02:50:48,757
[SPEAKER_14]: We're right in the middle of listless.

2347
02:50:52,958 --> 02:50:59,600
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic tonight, the top thing we want most for Christmas or Hanukkah, whatever you happen to celebrate.

2348
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:08,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were a little kid being sampled by the Hooligans website, the number one pick for them was a Game Boy Advance, which didn't even make our list.

2349
02:51:08,943 --> 02:51:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know it's not going to be there.

2350
02:51:10,943 --> 02:51:12,584
[SPEAKER_11]: It means we probably already have one.

2351
02:51:13,224 --> 02:51:14,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, these were the final choices.

2352
02:51:15,045 --> 02:51:27,934
[SPEAKER_03]: An ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, a DDR Extreme machine, which is a miracle because it's not even out until next year, but I'm just going to assume you're talking about a beta.

2353
02:51:28,954 --> 02:51:32,937
[SPEAKER_03]: A Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX controller arcade style.

2354
02:51:34,123 --> 02:51:40,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese PS2 and American PS2, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania controller and Drum Mania.

2355
02:51:40,926 --> 02:51:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say it's the holidays.

2356
02:51:42,226 --> 02:51:44,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Miracles happen this time around, you know.

2357
02:51:45,167 --> 02:51:46,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Miracles do happen.

2358
02:51:46,568 --> 02:51:46,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2359
02:51:47,108 --> 02:51:48,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Preachy Dave.

2360
02:51:49,829 --> 02:51:50,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate that.

2361
02:51:51,890 --> 02:51:56,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's read the top ones.

2362
02:51:56,952 --> 02:52:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to find a sound effect file, but I don't have one, so...

2363
02:52:05,154 --> 02:52:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, Ren, if you think you're happy now, wait till you hear this.

2364
02:52:15,082 --> 02:52:17,524
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a record of my favorite song.

2365
02:52:18,545 --> 02:52:23,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Happy Happy Joy Joy.

2366
02:52:28,021 --> 02:52:29,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, boys and girls.

2367
02:52:30,003 --> 02:52:32,405
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteek.

2368
02:52:32,805 --> 02:52:39,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The number three winner, Happy Happy Joy Joy, is... A GameCube and Animal Crossing.

2369
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:44,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, GameCube and Animal Crossing win.

2370
02:52:44,335 --> 02:52:45,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Third place.

2371
02:52:45,135 --> 02:52:46,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place winner is...

2372
02:52:48,587 --> 02:52:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: A 2DX arcade style controller.

2373
02:52:51,289 --> 02:52:52,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, that's the way it works.

2374
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:53,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, and the winner of Buy a Landslide, might I add.

2375
02:52:53,971 --> 02:52:56,093
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why, because it ain't even out yet, but hey.

2376
02:52:56,133 --> 02:52:57,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody gave the chatroom points for being smirks.

2377
02:53:15,109 --> 02:53:15,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

2378
02:53:16,509 --> 02:53:30,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We love our chatters and they did pick a DDR Extreme Machine as the number one must-have holiday present thing.

2379
02:53:32,773 --> 02:53:37,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Also getting honorable mentions, they tried to write in, there was a write-in candidate for Sky's Voice the Game.

2380
02:53:38,274 --> 02:53:40,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how that would be played.

2381
02:53:42,332 --> 02:53:43,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how that works.

2382
02:53:43,473 --> 02:53:46,774
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're going video game related with the Mail Order Bride, would it be like Ping from Megatokyo?

2383
02:53:46,794 --> 02:53:47,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2384
02:53:47,294 --> 02:53:47,554
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2385
02:53:49,155 --> 02:53:51,916
[SPEAKER_11]: People who read Megatokyo, Ping is a PS2 accessory.

2386
02:53:54,057 --> 02:53:56,658
[SPEAKER_11]: A life-size human PS2 accessory for dating sims.

2387
02:53:56,998 --> 02:54:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky's voice, the game, did not garner enough votes.

2388
02:54:00,779 --> 02:54:03,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't count because it wasn't on our list.

2389
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:04,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Sheesh.

2390
02:54:05,618 --> 02:54:07,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, deal with it.

2391
02:54:07,499 --> 02:54:09,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do another list list for my voice later.

2392
02:54:09,599 --> 02:54:11,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Every day is a game with Rob.

2393
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:15,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're saying that Skye's voice the game would be like Parappa the game.

2394
02:54:16,661 --> 02:54:18,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.

2395
02:54:19,482 --> 02:54:23,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something, like my... In the rain or in the snow, I got the funky flow.

2396
02:54:24,143 --> 02:54:26,304
[SPEAKER_11]: That means he has to pee.

2397
02:54:26,644 --> 02:54:29,725
[SPEAKER_11]: He got the funky flow from eating too much beans.

2398
02:54:30,165 --> 02:54:30,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dear good lord.

2399
02:54:32,296 --> 02:54:34,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's about time to end the show.

2400
02:54:34,579 --> 02:54:36,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, we've made it for three hours.

2401
02:54:36,802 --> 02:54:38,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, we've got to do Loki's sim update.

2402
02:54:38,844 --> 02:54:39,325
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2403
02:54:39,866 --> 02:54:40,386
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2404
02:54:40,546 --> 02:54:41,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go there, Rob.

2405
02:54:42,068 --> 02:54:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, shit, I thought we could get through one show without it.

2406
02:54:43,971 --> 02:54:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2407
02:54:44,812 --> 02:54:46,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, give us your sim update, Loki.

2408
02:54:46,133 --> 02:54:46,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it quick.

2409
02:54:47,215 --> 02:54:47,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much going on.

2410
02:54:47,976 --> 02:54:50,899
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got DWI, new version now, I believe they're up in LA.

2411
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:53,321
[SPEAKER_05]: 3Tubers, I don't know who cares, it doesn't really matter.

2412
02:54:53,781 --> 02:54:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the whole point is that they have karaoke now, um, is the lyrics.

2413
02:54:58,922 --> 02:55:01,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from 3rd Mix you were talking about earlier, that is now featured in EGWI.

2414
02:55:01,963 --> 02:55:02,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.

2415
02:55:03,563 --> 02:55:07,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people are actually, you know, making lyrics for songs and that wonderful stuff.

2416
02:55:07,665 --> 02:55:13,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And also they have the audition for special characters, you know, like the hearts and Japanese characters and stuff.

2417
02:55:13,886 --> 02:55:15,507
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that available now free to...

2418
02:55:16,241 --> 02:55:17,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So go check that out.

2419
02:55:17,482 --> 02:55:27,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, for all you Bomani Ruler DWI fans out there, on DDRmaniaX, you'll probably see a post in the user-submitted files saying something about a share.

2420
02:55:28,027 --> 02:55:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: DWI.

2421
02:55:28,788 --> 02:55:29,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

2422
02:55:29,488 --> 02:55:30,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not shared.

2423
02:55:30,329 --> 02:55:31,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the return.

2424
02:55:31,430 --> 02:55:40,096
[SPEAKER_05]: The last final Bimani Ruler unreleased track that you need to go download because it's supposed to be good, but I tried it and it's just four-key beat mania.

2425
02:55:40,156 --> 02:55:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, have fun with that.

2426
02:55:43,198 --> 02:55:49,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, also Tourney Mix 3 is going to be, you know, enter that if you haven't yet and it'll be fun.

2427
02:55:49,783 --> 02:55:51,965
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be posting up files probably at the end of December.

2428
02:55:52,065 --> 02:55:53,407
[SPEAKER_03]: How about MakeEditGetPorn?

2429
02:55:53,447 --> 02:55:54,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us an update on MakeEditGetPorn.

2430
02:55:54,889 --> 02:55:57,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I haven't really come up with a date yet.

2431
02:55:57,613 --> 02:56:00,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm acquiring more stuff to go in the boxes.

2432
02:56:00,797 --> 02:56:04,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on there.

2433
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:06,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll announce a date when we do have one.

2434
02:56:07,686 --> 02:56:26,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, aside from that, really not too much going on, just, um, check out DDRUK, do donate the money, because they're kind of short on money, but they do have, uh, you know, the Dancing Stage Party Edition files up, and also, um, you know, pretty much almost everything else, official-wise, so, go check it out, they have six sets for you to download, so, yeah, that's it.

2435
02:56:27,179 --> 02:56:36,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh, and one more thing, now, it's my understanding, you know, I'm not really sure about the Naoki Journal, because I can't read Japanese, but I believe that this is the last one.

2436
02:56:38,001 --> 02:56:38,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah!

2437
02:56:38,782 --> 02:56:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I cried.

2438
02:56:40,404 --> 02:56:40,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

2439
02:56:41,145 --> 02:56:41,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2440
02:56:43,847 --> 02:56:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, oh yeah, I guess it's that time to give our final thoughts of the night.

2441
02:56:47,071 --> 02:56:47,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

2442
02:56:48,172 --> 02:56:49,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just one little thing.

2443
02:56:49,774 --> 02:56:52,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I got BMX XXX for free, and it sucks.

2444
02:56:53,558 --> 02:56:55,640
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can pick up the hoe and take her to her pimp.

2445
02:56:56,882 --> 02:56:57,302
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

2446
02:56:57,682 --> 02:56:58,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, it's worth buying.

2447
02:57:00,353 --> 02:57:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's worth getting it for free.

2448
02:57:02,554 --> 02:57:04,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought, please.

2449
02:57:04,514 --> 02:57:07,555
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get Sci-Fi, tomorrow night at 9 p.m.

2450
02:57:07,735 --> 02:57:12,836
[SPEAKER_05]: is the first of ten two-hour-long mini-movies of Taken.

2451
02:57:13,297 --> 02:57:14,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the most awesome series.

2452
02:57:15,177 --> 02:57:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by ten different people.

2453
02:57:19,938 --> 02:57:21,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be really awesome.

2454
02:57:21,459 --> 02:57:22,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely check it out.

2455
02:57:23,619 --> 02:57:24,019
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2456
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:25,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Will do.

2457
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:26,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for you, Loki.

2458
02:57:26,877 --> 02:57:29,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um, I just found my Koosh thing.

2459
02:57:29,398 --> 02:57:30,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, yes, you found it.

2460
02:57:30,398 --> 02:57:42,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've had it, like, I brought it over here, I think, two months ago, and left it here, and I was wondering where it was, and then, hey, that guy, I forget his name, was playing with it.

2461
02:57:42,161 --> 02:57:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy Brad?

2462
02:57:43,282 --> 02:57:43,542
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2463
02:57:43,602 --> 02:57:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy Brad, or that guy, uh, uh, Neil?

2464
02:57:46,963 --> 02:57:47,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2465
02:57:47,383 --> 02:57:47,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2466
02:57:48,363 --> 02:57:48,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, him.

2467
02:57:49,083 --> 02:57:53,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, alright, people in my house that don't participate in Orange Lounge because they don't get the DDR thing.

2468
02:57:54,505 --> 02:57:54,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2469
02:57:55,245 --> 02:57:55,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2470
02:57:55,525 --> 02:57:55,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2471
02:57:56,394 --> 02:57:58,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got 97.5 on nearly 130.

2472
02:57:59,356 --> 02:58:00,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, for me.

2473
02:58:00,777 --> 02:58:01,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, still haven't beat me yet.

2474
02:58:02,338 --> 02:58:02,698
[SPEAKER_04]: What's you?

2475
02:58:03,198 --> 02:58:03,679
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you at?

2476
02:58:03,699 --> 02:58:05,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at like 98-something, I don't know.

2477
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:05,820
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2478
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:06,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2479
02:58:06,761 --> 02:58:07,942
[SPEAKER_04]: On the RVGL machine?

2480
02:58:08,362 --> 02:58:09,483
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not on the RVGL machine.

2481
02:58:09,503 --> 02:58:10,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a second place?

2482
02:58:10,623 --> 02:58:11,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Check the Scandi one.

2483
02:58:12,064 --> 02:58:12,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Check the Scandi one.

2484
02:58:13,205 --> 02:58:14,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I will beat it.

2485
02:58:15,738 --> 02:58:17,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but the second player side works.

2486
02:58:17,379 --> 02:58:19,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, who cares about the stomping game?

2487
02:58:19,559 --> 02:58:20,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Penis, penis, penis.

2488
02:58:20,519 --> 02:58:22,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Bradley, your final thought, please.

2489
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:26,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing is a copy of an aero-beat that I used to have on those things.

2490
02:58:26,941 --> 02:58:27,581
[SPEAKER_06]: An aero-beat?

2491
02:58:27,801 --> 02:58:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was like, harder than that.

2492
02:58:29,742 --> 02:58:33,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposed to be a thing you could throw the farthest.

2493
02:58:33,103 --> 02:58:36,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because now toys are supposed to be non-lethal.

2494
02:58:36,084 --> 02:58:36,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2495
02:58:37,064 --> 02:58:42,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, now that the show is over, the streets are now, once again, safe for Bimani.

2496
02:58:42,846 --> 02:58:44,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

2497
02:58:46,460 --> 02:58:47,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa to the Republic.

2498
02:58:48,243 --> 02:58:51,027
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is that my voice is not high and funny.

2499
02:58:51,668 --> 02:58:52,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It is deep and sexy.

2500
02:58:52,970 --> 02:58:53,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It's high in fiber.

2501
02:58:55,121 --> 02:58:58,205
[SPEAKER_11]: and I need to get... Rob's voice is high in fiber and fortified with vitamins.

2502
02:58:58,365 --> 02:58:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need to get laid.

2503
02:58:59,666 --> 02:59:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

2504
02:59:00,848 --> 02:59:01,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Whale!

2505
02:59:02,469 --> 02:59:03,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that special?

2506
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:04,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really, really need to get laid.

2507
02:59:04,832 --> 02:59:05,213
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2508
02:59:05,293 --> 02:59:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

2509
02:59:06,154 --> 02:59:06,754
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week.

2510
02:59:07,495 --> 02:59:08,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're pre-taped next week.

2511
02:59:08,957 --> 02:59:12,360
[SPEAKER_03]: If you missed a message earlier in the show, we'll be doing it live on Saturday.

2512
02:59:12,421 --> 02:59:15,944
