WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Oh! Message for you, son! Attention! Do you wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
About the biggest fairy you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Showgirls.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Absolute frightful.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Now's the time on Scrockets, then we dance!

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect for Spanish exercise is kendo.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey, hey, hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark Sakurai.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Shut up!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sky.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
We are live, and this is episode number 24, November the 17th of 2002.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
But not November 20th.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It is our second season premiere!

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Woo!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yay!

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And then we're supposed to do a thing.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yay!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It's like fall sweeps.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
It's sweeps week.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.760
In this episode, Jamie is going to get married.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
I don't!

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Fuck you!

02:01.760 --> 02:03.560
And Loki is going to have a baby.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
No.

02:04.560 --> 02:14.480
You are tuned in to the Bemani Scene's most premiered radio station of all things Bemani.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.680
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.680
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
Summers.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.680
Of course, as always, because we just can't get rid of him, it's Dave!

02:55.680 --> 02:58.680
Hello!

02:58.680 --> 02:59.680
He's our favorite little pest.

02:59.680 --> 03:04.680
Alright, we'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

03:04.680 --> 03:12.680
and this break is going to feature some second songs, like Second Mix, Second Style, and all sorts of things like that,

03:12.680 --> 03:14.680
because it is the second season of Orange Lounge.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.680
Or do you just have to go number two?

03:16.680 --> 03:19.680
Yes, I'm going to go take a big poopy right now. On your head!

03:19.680 --> 03:21.680
AHH!

03:21.680 --> 03:27.680
Uh, we'll be right back to talk about, uh, a lot of stuff, and maybe something about DDR, I don't know. We'll see.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.680
DDR? Who plays that anymore?

03:29.680 --> 03:36.680
I don't know, DRSK. Alright, see you in a little bit.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.680
Is this love and love for me?

04:05.680 --> 04:08.680
Cause when we dance together

04:08.680 --> 04:12.680
You're like a dream come true

04:12.680 --> 04:15.680
I feel so beautiful

04:15.680 --> 04:17.680
Heart and sight

04:17.680 --> 04:21.680
Resolve those of you

04:21.680 --> 04:24.680
Love, I just gotta have it all

04:24.680 --> 04:27.680
I believe in love

04:27.680 --> 04:29.680
I can't be without it

04:29.680 --> 04:33.680
Come to me and make your confession

04:33.680 --> 04:36.680
Love, come let it go

04:36.680 --> 04:39.680
Love, I just gotta have it

04:39.680 --> 04:42.680
I believe in love

04:42.680 --> 04:44.680
I can't be without it

04:44.680 --> 04:48.680
Come to me and make your confession

04:48.680 --> 04:49.660
Da!

04:49.660 --> 04:51.520
Go Magic!

04:51.520 --> 04:53.520
Let's go!

05:21.520 --> 05:28.520
Oh,

05:28.520 --> 05:35.520
oh,

05:35.520 --> 05:42.520
oh,

05:42.520 --> 05:49.520
oh,

06:19.520 --> 06:25.520
Love, love, love, love, love, love

08:19.520 --> 08:29.520
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

08:29.520 --> 08:36.520
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
We.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.520
We, a little bit earlier than usual.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.520
So that's the new game here, 6.30 to 9.30.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.520
We're so bored and have nothing to do.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.520
Yeah, we thought we'd share our boredom with the rest of you.

09:18.520 --> 09:24.960
It's Java, and Twen helped me out to figure out how we get a Java thing going, so thank

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
you to Twen too.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.960
But I'm not going to kiss Twen.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.960
No.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.960
Oh, my phone's ringing!

09:29.960 --> 09:30.960
That's my ringer.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.960
My bad.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.960
I'm not answering it on air, sorry.

09:32.960 --> 09:38.080
You should turn off your cell phone when we're on air.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.080
That's my booty call.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.080
Uh oh, Rob's got his booty call.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.080
Wail.

09:44.080 --> 09:50.120
Well, so the chat room right now, they're trying to get me to go to Vegas.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.680
They want us, I think they want all of us to come to Vegas, really, to do a show on

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
the road in Vegas.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Okay, are you going to pay?

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Yeah, I know.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
How are we going to...

09:57.680 --> 10:02.740
Well, I know that my buddy Irene, Rice Princess, she turned 21 this weekend, so now she's thinking

10:02.740 --> 10:06.040
about doing a Vegas trip, because it was supposed to be Reno this weekend.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
We were all going to go to Reno.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.560
Prostitution is legal in Vegas, right?

10:09.560 --> 10:13.300
Prostitution is not legal in Vegas or Vegas County, I don't think.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.300
outside it is.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.300
It sucks.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
I'm sorry?

10:16.300 --> 10:19.300
Isn't it legal in Nevada in general?

10:19.300 --> 10:21.700
Yes, but certain cities have it.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.660
There's like some big brothel that's right outside.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.220
Mustang Ranch.

10:26.220 --> 10:27.560
It's Mustang Ranch, man.

10:27.560 --> 10:32.500
I remember the one time on Under Station Live, the show I used to do on Saturday nights,

10:32.500 --> 10:35.780
we actually called the Bunny Ranch and got an interview with some prostitutes at the

10:35.780 --> 10:36.780
Bunny Ranch.

10:36.780 --> 10:37.780
It's a great radio.

10:37.780 --> 10:41.440
Maybe once we get that capability set up here we can...

10:41.440 --> 10:43.480
You want to interview some prostitutes, Jamie?

10:43.480 --> 10:44.480
Sure.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.940
What's it like to be a whore?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.320
You are a whore, darling.

10:49.320 --> 10:55.840
Speaking of whores, we watched, I made Jamie watch the best movie about Vegas that's ever

10:55.840 --> 11:00.880
been made, Showgirls, the motion picture.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.740
Three hours of stripping crap, it's so bad.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.120
That's why it is fun to watch, because it is so freaking horrible.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.920
What's our, what's our fuck from Saved by the Bell?

11:12.920 --> 11:17.560
Jessie Spano was her, well it's Elizabeth Berkley is her real name, but she was Jessie

11:17.560 --> 11:19.040
Spano on Saved by the Bell.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.440
She was most famous in one episode, which Spazzy, I don't know if he's listening right

11:23.440 --> 11:26.680
now, but he was trying to send me an episode of this, and it's been sending like all night

11:26.680 --> 11:27.680
long.

11:27.680 --> 11:32.800
He was sending me an episode of Saved by the Bell when Jessie has her caffeine pill addiction,

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
and she breaks down.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
I'm so excited!

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
I'm so excited!

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
I'm so scared!

11:36.800 --> 11:39.180
scared

11:39.180 --> 11:42.280

11:42.280 --> 11:46.580

11:50.880 --> 11:54.520

11:58.740 --> 12:00.580

12:00.580 --> 12:04.740
who's running a radio station out of his house

12:04.740 --> 12:08.660
Hey, fuck you! Not me, I'm just visiting. You're here, bastard.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.820
That's all I have to say.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.220
Yeah, there, we got people in the chat room admitting that they used to watch that show.

12:15.220 --> 12:19.780
I didn't watch Shaved by the Bell, because I think I was busy watching cartoons.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.860
What cartoons were you watching instead of Saved by the Bell? Saved by the Bell came on after all the cartoons.

12:23.860 --> 12:28.980
I was taping Ronan Warriors in the morning while I was still asleep, and then watching my tape when I got home

12:28.980 --> 12:32.860
in the afternoon after I watched all my other shows. Well, aren't you special?

12:32.860 --> 12:34.320
yes i am quite

12:34.320 --> 12:37.580
uh... saved by the bell tiffany amber thiessen

12:37.580 --> 12:42.460

12:42.460 --> 12:44.060
she was

12:44.060 --> 12:46.480
uh... now she's like stupid

12:46.480 --> 12:50.100
which is what she was she on now she's on some show and i was on my

12:50.100 --> 12:53.580
she's on the two and i will tell you that i mean that she's like

12:53.580 --> 12:55.540
in big parts of the movies

12:55.540 --> 12:57.180
uh...

12:57.180 --> 12:59.820
which means she's pretty much top was a lot of them right

12:59.820 --> 13:01.720
no actually now

13:01.720 --> 13:09.320
Uh, the last movie I remember seeing her in was, um, what was it, uh, Shriek, if I know what you did last Friday the 13th.

13:09.320 --> 13:15.620
Wasn't she, wasn't she in, um, uh, one of the Dust Till Dawn sequels, too?

13:15.620 --> 13:18.620
You know, I don't like to acknowledge the Dust Till Dawn sequels.

13:18.620 --> 13:23.920
I mean, okay, okay. Now, granted, number two did have Bruce Campbell in, so that made number two decent.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.620
Ha!

13:24.620 --> 13:25.620
I have to see that, then.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.720
Bruce Campbell was in Sacramento last week, by the way.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.420
What?

13:28.420 --> 13:32.420
Yes, Bruce Campbell did a signing at Borders or something. I just heard about it, like, last minute.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.420
That's alright. We saw him when he went to the Crest and did a...

13:36.420 --> 13:37.420
No.

13:37.420 --> 13:38.420
We saw Evil Dead there.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.420
Yes.

13:39.420 --> 13:43.420
My friend has himself on videotape with Bruce Campbell at E3.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.420
Cool.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.420
What was Bruce Campbell doing at E3?

13:46.420 --> 13:48.420
They released that game, but he was there...

13:48.420 --> 13:55.420
Well, it was the year before. He was there for that Evil Dead game that was on Dreamcast. It was really shitty.

13:55.420 --> 13:59.420
And then he was there last year, again, just signing stuff.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.420
Oh, just because he's Bruce Campbell.

14:02.420 --> 14:07.420
Well, we saw him when he was down at the Crest Theater and it was pretty cool because he

14:07.420 --> 14:13.420
was doing signings and stuff and then they did a screening of You Let Too, Dead by Dawn,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.420
which was great.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.420
Great movie.

14:16.420 --> 14:20.420
It's really fun to watch in a theater full of people, especially people I've seen the

14:20.420 --> 14:23.420
movie for, because everyone's just all cheering at the right spots.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.420
And he's like, tool shed!

14:25.420 --> 14:27.420
And everyone's like, YEAH!

14:27.420 --> 14:36.420
Why can't we get a screening of Showgirls at the Crest with Elizabeth Berkley live, and the chick who played the mama at the strip bar who had the...

14:36.420 --> 14:40.420
She'd go like that and her top would fly off and she was really ugly.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.420
Chicken bump on you.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.420
Oh, no, not the big fat chick. I'm talking Elizabeth Berkley.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.420
Hey, if we want to recreate through the scenes of the movie...

14:49.420 --> 14:52.420
Elizabeth Berkley looks like a skank. Ew.

14:52.420 --> 14:57.420
Looks like a duck. Looks like my sister. Quacks like a duck, must be a duck.

14:57.420 --> 15:02.420
You don't care. You can put a paper bag on her head.

15:02.420 --> 15:07.420
Hey, don't ruin it.

15:07.420 --> 15:12.420
Last week, by the way, if you missed it, we talked about Loki's wide collection of porn. Which reminds me, how's the contest coming?

15:12.420 --> 15:17.420
Would you like to make an announcement on the new contest, Make Edit Get Porn?

15:17.420 --> 15:22.060
get porn yes it's an actual real contest now

15:22.060 --> 15:27.060
you basically you make an edit for any song that appears on ddrmax USA

15:27.060 --> 15:29.200
and you send that edit to me in any form

15:29.200 --> 15:32.740
i mean you can make the edit with the japanese version of

15:32.740 --> 15:37.880
a ddr game that happens to have the same song that you know is in ddrmax USA

15:37.880 --> 15:40.620
dwi you make an sm file just some

15:40.620 --> 15:42.420
some way to get step chart

15:42.420 --> 15:43.980
some way to get it to me

15:43.980 --> 15:47.940
and then you know i'll take care of the rest and send you out a big box of porn

15:47.940 --> 15:49.860
that's that's how it works

15:49.860 --> 15:51.480
i tried proposing this to the

15:51.480 --> 15:54.980
ddr maniacs uh... forms and it just didn't get there

15:54.980 --> 15:58.820
i like the idea of an edit contest but why porn?

15:58.820 --> 16:01.820
because i've done other edit contests before and they're like

16:01.820 --> 16:06.860
but why porn? because everything else has been done! they're okay and you do a normal edit

16:06.860 --> 16:09.160
i want boys. well sorry i don't have that

16:09.160 --> 16:13.100
we will find a way to maybe donate some boy porn to the contest we'll see if we

16:13.100 --> 16:17.380
can figure something out. We don't know if we'll have DVDs necessarily, but we'll get

16:17.380 --> 16:20.420
boy porn in one way or another, just for the ladies, okay?

16:20.420 --> 16:24.460
Alright, well anyways... Oh, go ahead, Dave.

16:24.460 --> 16:28.940
Instead of, like, getting boy porn for the winner, how about just donate boy porn to

16:28.940 --> 16:32.860
Jamie, because I don't think anyone else, including me, would want boy porn.

16:32.860 --> 16:40.300
Now, now, we're neglecting some locals like Anita, DDRholic, RicePrincess... I don't know,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.660
there's folks out there that might want boy porn, who knows?

16:42.660 --> 16:46.380
i don't get it if you know guys

16:46.380 --> 16:47.820
talk about you know

16:47.820 --> 16:50.180
just all-girl porn you know

16:50.180 --> 16:53.460
like here we have our all-boy porn

16:53.460 --> 16:55.720
i'm not saying that you can understand it

16:55.720 --> 16:58.220
what would you want girl porn like girl on coral

16:58.220 --> 17:00.280
girl on girl action

17:00.280 --> 17:06.500
because homosexuality is wrong and bags go to hell but being lesbians okay

17:06.500 --> 17:08.700
i don't

17:08.700 --> 17:11.020
fake body parts okay

17:11.020 --> 17:14.260
to be that attractive. I like seeing pretty boys with nice abs.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.680
They're not fake, they're enhanced.

17:16.680 --> 17:20.040
I'll have you know those are ab implants, okay?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.500
Now, but anyways,

17:21.500 --> 17:26.040
if I got free guy porn, then sure, I'd throw in free guy porn, but I just get free girl porn,

17:26.040 --> 17:27.140
so uh...

17:27.140 --> 17:29.300
that's what's going in the box.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.200
Um, but yeah, they just, no one could understand why I was doing a contest to get

17:33.200 --> 17:37.360
porn, and I was like, because it's funny. Because it's porn! Because it's fun!

17:37.360 --> 17:42.360
I'm all, they're all, why don't you do a normal contest with regular prizes?

17:42.360 --> 17:47.360
So first I like, I kind of caved for about a minute, and I said, ah fuck them.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.360
You want a normal edit contest, go enter turn a mix three or whatever.

17:52.360 --> 17:59.360
This is a pornographic edit contest. It's called make edit get porn, not make edit get something not porn.

17:59.360 --> 18:04.360
I should have made that rule that all the titles for the edits have to be sexually ambiguous.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.360
Pr0n

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
Pr0n

18:09.360 --> 18:12.360
I wanted Pr0n to go to freaking like, you know...

18:12.360 --> 18:17.360
If JB, it's like JB wins it, he'll uh, he'll try to deep fry it and you'll have deep fried Pr0n

18:21.360 --> 18:26.360
No, but seriously, there'll be quite a bit of stuff in this box here

18:26.360 --> 18:29.360
That might be the slight problem though

18:29.360 --> 18:36.360
Obviously, this contest is only open for anyone of age that can view porn in your state or county.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.360
As long as, if you enter, I am assuming that you are of age and that you're...

18:39.360 --> 18:41.360
You're convincing enough to lie about it.

18:41.360 --> 18:46.360
Yes. If you enter, I am assuming that you're of age. Do not tell me otherwise. It's don't ask, don't tell.

18:46.360 --> 18:52.360
If you cannot have pornography mailed to your house, don't enter. Don't.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.360
Remember, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.

18:55.360 --> 19:10.360
Yes, and we're not talking about a little bit of porn, we're talking a lot of porn, so this is gonna, you gotta, we'll arrange, you know, transportation of the porn to your house, but we'll arrange a nice brown paper bag.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.360
Yes, like not a little bit of porn, like a whole two and a half days worth of porn. That's a lot.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
It will paint a little green door on the package.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.360
package.

19:20.360 --> 19:27.440
Anyways, yeah, so the contest is still on. I have no entrance yet, but I haven't even

19:27.440 --> 19:34.240
announced a date for it, so. So, I mean, you know, whenever, I'll think of a date. In the

19:34.240 --> 19:37.980
meantime, just get your edits ready and, yeah.

19:37.980 --> 19:42.320
Even though a lot of people aren't entering, like, haven't signed up or whatever for entering,

19:42.320 --> 19:48.160
I know that there is a lot of hype going on, especially within the Sackpamani forums about

19:48.160 --> 19:54.160
about people wanting to enter this, such as Orange Beanie, and me, and other people.

19:54.160 --> 19:59.160
This isn't restricted just to Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento. It's everybody.

19:59.160 --> 20:05.160
Nationwide, international, international. If you live in Belgium and you want prawn, enter.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.160
As long as you have the right region for your DVD player or a good hack.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.160
Oh yeah, that's a good point though, because they're all U.S. region DVDs.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.160
I'm going to have to actually limit it to the continental United States.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.160
Oh, okay. What about Canada?

20:16.160 --> 20:22.160
Yeah, it's just it gets a little expensive ship stuff to other countries.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.160
Oh, that's true. Continental US then only.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.160
Continental US, yes.

20:25.160 --> 20:31.160
Maybe if somebody internationally wants to enter, maybe we'll just send you some net porn.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.160
We'll send you a few dirty pictures.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.160
I'll arrange something, yeah, for those who can't do that.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.160
I actually found, you know this is really sad,

20:42.160 --> 20:47.660
Is someone made Nintendo 64 emulated porn?

20:47.660 --> 20:50.600
A Nintendo 64 porn? What is that, Mario Party or something?

20:50.600 --> 20:55.420
No, it's just like, I don't know, it's like they made a ROM file with porn in it. It was weird.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.740
Wahoo!

20:56.740 --> 20:58.540
They have those for Super Nintendo.

20:58.540 --> 21:04.200
There's like 30 pictures of them. I downloaded this ROM that was labeled as this game I wanted and it was porn.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.460
Cool!

21:05.460 --> 21:09.140
It was like big, you know, twat shot porn.

21:09.140 --> 21:11.940
Ew!

21:11.940 --> 21:15.940
You need to see pixelated cooter, okay?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.940
Plus, add an option.

21:17.940 --> 21:22.940
I guess what it does is activates the rumble pack for a very long time.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.940
What?

21:25.940 --> 21:29.940
So that was really weird, but yeah.

21:29.940 --> 21:30.940
It's out there.

21:30.940 --> 21:35.940
You have no idea how many times I click on something for Kazaa.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.940
It's like, Initial D, episode 22.

21:37.940 --> 21:41.940
Oh, wait, that's not Initial D. That looks like porn.

21:41.940 --> 21:46.180
Not Initial D. Yeah, that pissed me off. I was trying to find Jackass, the movie.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.180
I ended up getting Sorority Boys.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.660
Yeah, then you see the male ass.

21:50.660 --> 21:52.060
I was like, no!

21:52.060 --> 21:54.700
Of course I'm downloading Chamber of Secrets right now.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.180
I didn't get to go today.

21:57.180 --> 22:01.100
Oh, you and your Harry Potter. Speaking of porn...

22:01.100 --> 22:03.180
Just kidding.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.240
Speaking of porn, Harry Potter, come on!

22:06.240 --> 22:11.000
well i don't know i don't want to know if you know where to get to the g

22:11.000 --> 22:14.120
how was harry potter anyway very very good

22:14.120 --> 22:17.400
we're planning on having a trip again to go see it sometime very soon if you want

22:17.400 --> 22:17.920
to come

22:17.920 --> 22:20.400
and join in on the action

22:20.400 --> 22:22.560
need ruling over alan rickman on-screen

22:22.560 --> 22:26.640
okay alan rickman on he was so

22:26.640 --> 22:32.540
because fabulous

22:32.540 --> 22:34.260
Yeah, Harry Potter word.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.260
Oh, speaking of...

22:35.260 --> 22:37.060
Go from porn to Harry Potter!

22:37.060 --> 22:40.140
Speaking of pornography, you know I have something that still goes along the lines of pornography.

22:40.140 --> 22:43.660
This has kind of been circulating a lot of the web boards this week.

22:43.660 --> 22:48.940
We've been given this link that talks about the DDR up the skirt camera.

22:48.940 --> 22:49.940
I don't know if you guys...

22:49.940 --> 22:53.300
I'll post the link in the chat room for those that maybe haven't seen this, although I think

22:53.300 --> 22:55.660
it's been hoarded out on just about every forum out there.

22:55.660 --> 22:56.660
But just in case...

22:56.660 --> 22:57.980
Not to mention there's at least five live journals.

22:57.980 --> 22:59.580
Yeah, like different live journals and such.

22:59.580 --> 23:03.020
But just in case, there's the link in the chatroom for you guys.

23:03.020 --> 23:07.340
It's basically a pornography where it shows these Japanese schoolgirls, of course they're

23:07.340 --> 23:10.620
dressed like Catholic schoolgirls, you wouldn't have it any other way.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.080
And yeah, they all look like Sailor Moon.

23:13.080 --> 23:18.460
And there's a little camera right in the center of a DDR pad that films up their skirt.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.980
They even have a diagram illustrating where the camera is.

23:20.980 --> 23:25.340
Yeah, it just like points out, you know, insert camera here.

23:25.340 --> 23:26.780
It's a big black dot.

23:26.780 --> 23:32.780
We should translate this page, shouldn't we? I should run this through the translator because I haven't done that yet. Let's see.

23:32.780 --> 23:36.780
What do you guys think of this while I get translated?

23:36.780 --> 23:46.780
I think this is the fakest thing I've ever seen in my life. Obviously all these girls have been paid to do the dancing, but what do you guys think?

23:46.780 --> 23:59.780
Well, they were probably paid to play the game, but they may not have known about the camera, even though it'd be kind of blatantly obvious to anyone that knows the game that there's a large black dot in the middle of the pad. It's like, why is that thing looking up at me?

23:59.780 --> 24:00.780
No, I would think...

24:00.780 --> 24:02.780
Take a picture so the girl's looking at the camera.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.780
You could probably hide it under there pretty well.

24:05.780 --> 24:09.780
You'd have to do it really well, and I don't think it's really that worth it.

24:09.780 --> 24:18.780
Let's see. This is the English translation of the website. Should we do some reading of the English translation of the website here?

24:18.780 --> 24:19.780
Go for it.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.780
Alright, I'm trying to get some website reading music here.

24:21.780 --> 24:33.780
Yeah, but I just don't see how, like, I mean I can think of that you could hide the camera pretty well, but how many girls wear, like, miniskirts and play? I don't think I've ever seen a girl wear a skirt or a miniskirt and play.

24:33.780 --> 24:36.780
Alright, let's hear what this PornCam site's advertising here.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.780
I was, like, the guy's all ogling at the screen.

24:43.780 --> 24:45.780
Uh, it says, make it wait.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.280
Ah, carry it out.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.180
A playwoman, quantity students, lower half of the body,

24:50.180 --> 24:52.260
collection of images of a shock.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.660
The fourth cartridge, a ban is removed at last.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.660
This time, it photographs before the first game in series,

24:58.660 --> 25:02.380
and photography is ventured.

25:02.380 --> 25:02.880
What?

25:02.880 --> 25:04.620
Surrender, women, quantity student

25:04.620 --> 25:08.220
with sufficient super qua.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.420
Lump, teabag, photography, a success.

25:15.420 --> 25:18.060
Let's hear it for Nistia Globalgate.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.660
The woman quantity students aimed at this time

25:20.660 --> 25:22.300
total six sets.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.980
It clicks on each lower photograph

25:24.980 --> 25:26.940
and is to a verification page.

25:26.940 --> 25:30.380
I don't know if that's letting me do.

25:30.380 --> 25:30.900
Yeah.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.700
Oh, close ups.

25:32.700 --> 25:33.860
Look.

25:33.860 --> 25:41.860
Let's see. K.O., the woman who shows splendid dancing, like, while swaying the flare.

25:41.860 --> 25:46.860
It seems to be the dance of a proposal of marriage completely.

25:46.860 --> 25:52.860
Okay, well let me just put it this way. They haven't been playing DDR very long since they got some serious rolls on that ass.

25:52.860 --> 26:01.860
The whiter panties to the upper one of the leg extended smoothly, which seemed to be

26:01.860 --> 26:02.860
warm.

26:02.860 --> 26:06.080
It is a fortunate shot.

26:06.080 --> 26:12.060
Is it noticed that a camera is, Japanese, is an exciting moment?

26:12.060 --> 26:15.100
She's looking right down at the camera.

26:15.100 --> 26:21.280
A super-mini and loose exquisite balance and snow-white panties cannot be removed too.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.280
You want to hear something very ironic about this whole thing?

26:24.280 --> 26:30.280
There's no way that they wouldn't show anything other than a panty shot because it's illegal to show anything like that in Japan in the first place.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.280
It totally blows up.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.280
Doesn't this look like a cooter right there?

26:33.280 --> 26:35.280
This chick's not wearing underwear?

26:35.280 --> 26:39.280
Is it just the lighting?

26:39.280 --> 26:41.280
No, I can't click on it.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.280
Let's see, I'm trying to look at more verification page, see if we can see some...

26:44.280 --> 26:49.280
Oh, I don't know.

26:49.280 --> 26:56.280
just

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
Why would you want shit?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.280
I still don't think of you at first

27:23.280 --> 27:26.280
My family's a concern

27:26.280 --> 27:28.280
What do you point me at?

27:28.280 --> 27:31.280
Oh, the link. Oh, it's a Shockwave file. I don't know what I'm going to get.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.280
Let's see. Okay, so that's enough of that.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.280
Let's click on this Shockwave file I've been getting.

27:36.280 --> 27:41.280
So, any chance we'll ever see a series like this in America?

27:41.280 --> 27:44.280
Panty Panty Revolution?

27:44.280 --> 27:50.280
I don't know about that, but I'm sure that they can, you know, put the girls gone wild chicks on there jumping around and that, you know.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.280
Just take a DDR machine and Mardi Gras.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.280
And let fun ensue.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.280
I see profits!

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
Anyways.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.280
I have no idea what this is that I just got in the chat room.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
It's a fish with legs.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.280
It's a fish with legs and it's speaking a lot of Japanese.

28:40.280 --> 28:46.280
There's a kitty eating a fried egg!

28:46.280 --> 28:49.280
Thank you, Kikoman!

28:49.280 --> 28:52.280
Show me, show you!

29:02.280 --> 29:07.280
They look like little kittens. They look like fried kittens.

29:07.280 --> 29:12.280
1. Soy Sauce 2. Iced Rice

29:12.280 --> 29:17.280
3. Iced Rice

29:17.280 --> 29:22.280
4. Soy Sauce

29:22.280 --> 29:27.280
5. Soy Sauce

29:27.280 --> 29:32.280
6. Soy Sauce

29:32.280 --> 29:50.280
kinko man, kinko man, show me, show you, kinko man, right, right, kinko man, kinko man,

29:50.280 --> 29:52.280
Ice cream pops in the wiener!

30:20.280 --> 30:24.280
You probably have to get the girls drunk first.

30:50.280 --> 31:00.640
little bit like DDR in the nude Jesus I would think so how would it painful

31:00.640 --> 31:05.560
floppy floppy floppy if you got if you're a woman and you have big boobs

31:05.560 --> 31:09.920
you'd be whacking yourself in the face I don't want once me and Paul over like

31:09.920 --> 31:14.680
one of the first times I played I went down to uh I don't know the Riptide

31:14.680 --> 31:19.120
arcade the old one before it was the Riptide arcade or whatever the old place

31:19.120 --> 31:25.760
And there was this one girl who was playing, and her boobs were bouncing up and down so

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
much.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.880
It was like Jiggle Jiggle Revolution, I think we called it.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.240
I need to go throw up now.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
I think I saw a freestyle like that the other day.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.840
I need to go throw up a lot now.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.520
Are we going to take a quick break and come back?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.520
Yeah, let's take a quick break.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.080
Okay, we're going to take a really quick break, and we'll come right back, and when we come

31:40.080 --> 31:46.360
back, we'll get off the pornography subject, ha ha ha ha, yeah right, and we'll talk to

31:46.360 --> 31:49.720
Black Lab a little more, because he's our special guest, so we have to interview him

31:49.720 --> 31:53.720
while he's here. So, I'm going to get to a request that we had in the chatroom a little

31:53.720 --> 31:59.000
bit earlier. This is from 2Dx8style. It's the super special Secret Stage at Xenon, right

31:59.000 --> 32:10.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Oh

37:40.000 --> 37:52.000
It's the seed of my heart, what you feel deep inside

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
And it means you better stay behind

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
It's the death of your soul, that you tried to relieve

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Never until your body functions

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Feel it, feel it, baby

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Feel the fire, it's coming deep inside me

38:37.000 --> 39:02.320

Ready for the race?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.640

39:56.760 --> 39:59.960
well we had an email request for more popping music last week

39:59.960 --> 40:03.480

POMU is pop and music.

40:40.520 --> 40:46.320
If you're just now joining us, a friendly reminder, Orange Lounge Season 2 debuted tonight

40:46.320 --> 40:50.840
and we start the show a half hour earlier now and we run it a half hour later, which

40:50.840 --> 40:53.840
Which means it's three hours long. No, the webcam is not on.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.840
Okay, because people would be looking at my feet right now.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.840
Uh, the big show starts now at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.840
So wake up earlier.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.840
Yes. Get your ass here earlier.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
Hi, Black Lab. How are you?

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
Let's talk to Black Lab.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.840
It's our favorite puppy.

41:10.840 --> 41:11.840
Yeah.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.840
Good puppy.

41:13.840 --> 41:14.840
Sit.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.840
Sit, Ubu. Sit.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.840
I'm already on the ground, dammit.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.880
Yes, because you can't have my chair.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.480
Black Lab's already sitting here on his knees.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.600
Don't go there.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.360
Don't go there.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.840
So you've been listening since what?

41:31.840 --> 41:33.960
About the first episode of Orange Lounge, right?

41:33.960 --> 41:35.080
Or a little later, right?

41:35.080 --> 41:36.600
A little later.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.280
I started listening, I think, episode six.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.880
And then I went in the chat room like two weeks after that.

41:42.880 --> 41:44.200
I've been whoring out the series.

41:44.200 --> 41:44.680
Yes.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.000
Oh, you're a walking billboard for Orange Lounge.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.640
We appreciate that.

41:48.640 --> 41:56.120
So, now you most notably might be known because you used to work at one of the many golf lands,

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
yes?

41:57.120 --> 42:01.760
Yes, I had my experience working at Castro Valley Golf Land, and I know it's small, and

42:01.760 --> 42:07.200
I know most people consider it ghetto, because Milpitas and Sunnyvale are much bigger, living

42:07.200 --> 42:08.200
in the ghetto.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.040
Well, it's not really ghetto, it's more like, well, it's Castro Valley.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.040
It's the hood.

42:13.040 --> 42:18.040
It's like a white and partially Latino hood.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
Okay.

42:19.040 --> 42:23.040
And it's up in the hills, it's not like down in the city area.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.040
It's not even a real city though.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.040
So, what kind of Bamonians do they have at Castro Valley?

42:28.040 --> 42:33.040
Oh, we have the usual standard Max IIs.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
Oh, we have a 3rd Korean, yeah!

42:35.040 --> 42:37.040
Don't see many of those anymore.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.040
And then we also have a 4th Plus.

42:39.040 --> 42:45.500
Oh yeah, a US version of Guitar Freaks and a beat stage vidmix, which is with a discolored

42:45.500 --> 42:46.680
screen I might add.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.760
What exactly did you used to do at Castor Valley Golf League?

42:48.760 --> 42:49.760
You weren't a tech.

42:49.760 --> 42:50.760
You just...

42:50.760 --> 42:51.760
I was...

42:51.760 --> 42:52.760
You were a jizmo?

42:52.760 --> 42:53.760
General...

42:53.760 --> 42:54.760
I was general maintenance.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.360
I made sure the place didn't collapse on itself.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.360
Oh, I see.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.120
Now were you there for the big tournament they did at Castor Valley a couple months

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
ago?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.120
Yeah.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.360
Oh, yes I was, as a matter of fact.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.360
Most people probably don't know this.

43:05.360 --> 43:08.640
If it weren't for me, that whole thing would have fallen flat on its frickin' face.

43:08.640 --> 43:15.640
Oh, I see. Ego, ego. No, I'm serious though. I was like the main link to the management

43:16.600 --> 43:21.760
and it kind of got screwed over at the last minute without my knowledge because I was

43:21.760 --> 43:25.640
trying to make sure that the machine would be going outside for the tournament, but no,

43:25.640 --> 43:30.300
the manager changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to tell anyone until the next

43:30.300 --> 43:36.160
morning when I'm there an hour before the place even opens to get this machine moved

43:36.160 --> 43:40.480
outside and the supervisor that morning comes in and is like, oh, the machine's not going

43:40.480 --> 43:48.480
outside. And I'm like, oh, shit. And I pretty much damn near killed myself trying to make

43:48.480 --> 43:53.160
sure there was enough room for people to be in there, and I ended up missing pretty much

43:53.160 --> 43:58.780
the entire term because I had a migraine from nearly killing myself. Ouch. Oh, I'm sorry.

43:58.780 --> 44:02.400
And then I had to come and clean up after you bastards! I didn't go, so you didn't clean

44:02.400 --> 44:04.200
up after me.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.520
Why didn't we have any fuck you music playing during that?

44:07.520 --> 44:10.800
That's not really a fuck you. That's not really a fuck you. That's a fuck you of like three

44:10.800 --> 44:12.960
months ago. I thought the fuck you of this week.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.380
We'll get to those later.

44:14.380 --> 44:15.600
Post dated F.U.

44:15.600 --> 44:20.760
We have to catch up. You usually send about ten F.U.s of the week every week, so...

44:20.760 --> 44:23.240
Well, it's been kind of going down lately.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.120
You're getting a little happier with life.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.060
A little.

44:26.060 --> 44:30.520
So now you've moved from Castro Valley to the wide wonderful... I didn't live in Castro Valley.

44:30.520 --> 44:34.560
Oh, I lived in San Leander, which is right nearby, obviously, if you were to catch my

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
right.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
Okay.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
But you've moved basically to Sacramento.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.800
You don't live in Sacramento, but you live in the People's Republic of Davis, which is

44:39.800 --> 44:42.560
a small hippie town just, you know, right outside of San Leander.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.560
With a college!

44:43.560 --> 44:44.560
Oh, wow!

44:44.560 --> 44:47.960
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

44:47.960 --> 44:49.400
Abandon hope I have.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.760
So how does Davis differ than the Bay Area for you?

44:52.760 --> 44:53.760
It's for...

44:53.760 --> 44:57.160
You get a fine for breathing.

44:57.160 --> 45:03.160
Davis, by the way, the town that arrested the lady for snoring too loud, I think, wasn't that Davis?

45:03.160 --> 45:05.160
I didn't hear anything about Davis.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.160
Those were years ago, probably before you were born.

45:07.160 --> 45:13.160
Pretty little flat college town with absolutely nothing in it, and it's boring as hell.

45:13.160 --> 45:20.160
And the college sucks because they aren't letting first year students have their cars when there's plenty of parking, and I'm hating it.

45:20.160 --> 45:23.160
And there's one DDR machine in the whole town, correct?

45:23.160 --> 45:30.920
yes and it's a it's a max one in a tapioca express so you don't really see

45:30.920 --> 45:38.840
many about it and DER yes a beautiful combination yeah it would be stripped

45:38.840 --> 45:44.840
too but they ran out of the shrimp there but it's a max one there and it's like

45:44.840 --> 45:49.400
the volume is not that loud and yeah so how did you get into playing DDR was it

45:49.400 --> 45:55.400
Were you working at CVGL before Beaumont got big and they got the game one day?

45:55.400 --> 46:02.400
No, it was almost two years ago when I started, when I actually first played DDR.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.400
Where did you first play DDR?

46:04.400 --> 46:07.400
At Castro Valley Golf Land, as a matter of fact.

46:07.400 --> 46:12.400
I just played a USA mix there and failed to stomp to my feet on my first song.

46:12.400 --> 46:15.400
Yeah, I was pretty much hooked after that.

46:15.400 --> 46:20.400
I've lost many hours in many twenties since then.

46:20.400 --> 46:25.400
Now, you didn't get the job at Golfland so you could play more free DDR, did you?

46:25.400 --> 46:26.400
Because that's sad.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.400
No, I didn't.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.400
Sure.

46:28.400 --> 46:35.400
I knew people that were there and they knew me and it made it easier to get a job there

46:35.400 --> 46:39.400
for a summer job to get money to go to college.

46:39.400 --> 46:44.200
The free only $20 in tokens every two weeks that I got

46:44.200 --> 46:47.240
wasn't that big.

46:47.240 --> 46:52.280
But hey, at least I got to play some stuff.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.400
Alright, that's Black Lab, everybody.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.880
Yay.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.440
Alright.

46:57.440 --> 47:02.560
So, what do we talk about now? We've got to fill three hours in this fish.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.600
This is the moment on Orange Island where we yodel.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.880
Give the mic to Loki, he's got something to say.

47:07.880 --> 47:11.880
Has anyone out there seen that show Three South?

47:11.880 --> 47:14.880
Three South? No, what station is that on?

47:14.880 --> 47:15.880
MTV.

47:15.880 --> 47:17.880
No, I don't watch crap.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.880
I broke the clip again.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.880
Okay, anyways, no, it's this really cool cartoon.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.880
Do you want the clip or the mic?

47:25.880 --> 47:26.880
I want the clip.

47:26.880 --> 47:31.880
Okay, anyways, so it's this really pretty funny show, actually.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.880
It's the new cartoon they have on there, and it's about these three college guys

47:35.880 --> 47:38.280
And from what I gathered, they're pretty retarded.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.080
Uh, SoCalKick says it's stupid.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.080
I watched it, it was funny.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.680
Your opinion counts for Jack.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.980
Anyways.

47:46.980 --> 47:49.580
So, it was pretty funny, um, it was about...

47:49.580 --> 47:54.680
Today's episode is about constructing the, uh, Stomach Pump 2000.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.280
Right.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.680
Is that like Sorority Life, but animated?

47:59.680 --> 48:02.180
With less bitching and, uh, no hot chicks and...

48:02.180 --> 48:04.380
Sorority Life was set in Davis.

48:04.380 --> 48:07.380
That's something Davis is famous for.

48:07.380 --> 48:12.380
Yeah, now we know publicly that there's plenty of bitches in fucking Davis.

48:12.380 --> 48:15.380
Yeah, and that really helps me a lot.

48:15.380 --> 48:16.380
Uh-huh.

48:16.380 --> 48:17.380
Yeah.

48:17.380 --> 48:22.380
I'm sorry to interrupt, you were talking about some crappy show on MTV.

48:22.380 --> 48:25.380
It was entertaining, okay?

48:25.380 --> 48:27.380
I mean, I had fun watching it.

48:27.380 --> 48:32.380
I now know it's on Thursdays, it gives me something to watch on Thursdays before I'm waiting for

48:32.380 --> 48:39.300
I don't know the daily the daily show with Jon Stewart. Yeah, that's quality television that show owns

48:40.300 --> 48:44.340
That show I don't know where the pin is. I'd lost the pin

48:44.340 --> 48:50.260
I broke the clip again cool didn't you think some of the older animated shows on MTV were much better though like

48:51.020 --> 48:53.020
Beavis and Butthead

48:53.020 --> 48:54.860
beyond television

48:54.860 --> 48:58.360
Huh with television that brought birth to both of those two shows. Yes

48:58.360 --> 49:19.360
Siffle and Ollie

49:28.360 --> 49:31.360
with alex winner hasn't built those have been

49:31.360 --> 49:32.480
uh...

49:32.480 --> 49:35.960
i just remember the one show where he got shot in the head beginning of it

49:35.960 --> 49:38.680
and so the whole out that he was bleeding

49:38.680 --> 49:40.180
he didn't realize until

49:40.180 --> 49:42.000
he reached up scratch his head and then

49:42.000 --> 49:44.940
yes i'm reading and i

49:44.940 --> 49:48.320
well then there is this two other shows that we probably want to forget about

49:48.320 --> 49:49.160
the state

49:49.160 --> 49:50.380
the state or would

49:50.380 --> 49:52.840
the state was like the best of it sorry

49:52.840 --> 49:57.980
i'm talking about and uh... i wasn't like the head

49:57.980 --> 49:59.920
I liked the head, fuck you.

49:59.920 --> 50:00.840
She likes head.

50:00.840 --> 50:05.500
Anyways, and then there's also the uh... the Max.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.160
The Max was cool too.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.820
It was comic book genius.

50:08.820 --> 50:12.940
I liked when they were talking about the Izzes. The ones that were just like... I think it was the Izzes.

50:12.940 --> 50:17.220
The uh... stupid slugs that would jump like fifty feet in the air and then couldn't land.

50:17.220 --> 50:19.620
They'd jump and just splat. It was cool.

50:19.620 --> 50:21.980
You know what we need an animated series of?

50:21.980 --> 50:24.220
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.060
Well, we have Zim.

50:26.060 --> 50:29.940
Oh fuck that dude, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac would be awesome.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.340
Maybe later.

50:31.340 --> 50:34.260
Like little shorts of Happy Noodle Boy.

50:34.260 --> 50:39.040
Just Happy Noodle Boy would even be good.

50:39.040 --> 50:43.300
The chat room, Vandalous in the chat room is asking, does anybody remember a show on

50:43.300 --> 50:46.460
Nickelodeon called Turkey Television?

50:46.460 --> 50:48.780
I barely remember it. I remember not liking it.

50:48.780 --> 50:51.000
I remember the name but like

50:51.000 --> 50:54.780
barely anything about it.

50:54.780 --> 50:57.220
i used to watch out of control

50:57.220 --> 51:00.480
was that the one that the guy we cut it out was that

51:00.480 --> 51:02.940
yeah i think that's good

51:02.940 --> 51:03.620
yes

51:03.620 --> 51:07.860
the one that would like to be longer yes all of that shows that mark summer from

51:07.860 --> 51:10.580
double-dare but it wasn't yes i know what you're talking about it was the guy

51:10.580 --> 51:11.660
from full house

51:11.660 --> 51:12.840
he did the cut it out

51:12.840 --> 51:14.640
yeah i hella remember that show

51:14.640 --> 51:17.980
and uh... well i remember seeing a land when you can't have a long as we're

51:17.980 --> 51:21.500
reminiscing about old school and we know what else is right about here

51:21.500 --> 51:24.600
fun house with jd ross

51:24.600 --> 51:26.680
that shows off them

51:26.680 --> 51:29.320
that show bucky rule

51:29.320 --> 51:31.820
i had i had a computer game that had

51:31.820 --> 51:35.440
that uh... of but how's that with this shit i was actually look at stuff about

51:35.440 --> 51:39.960
fun house this week and they have they had a jd ross fan club and then talk

51:39.960 --> 51:41.120
about that i think

51:41.120 --> 51:43.760
fucking uh... homo like

51:43.760 --> 51:47.400
he had a little homo pedophile i swear to god he's like sending like

51:47.400 --> 51:50.680
photos of him just all sprawled out for children said

51:50.680 --> 51:52.160
enjoy any

51:52.160 --> 51:57.100
As Loki's imitating the pictures here in the corner of the room.

51:57.100 --> 51:58.320
That guy was sad.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.780
That guy was really sad.

51:59.780 --> 52:00.940
He was like

52:00.940 --> 52:03.220
one step below Vanilla Ice.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.500
And just horrible.

52:04.500 --> 52:10.340
I remember that show, but remember that J.D. Roth was also the host of GameProTV.

52:10.340 --> 52:16.400
Well, I just brought this show to a screeching halt with that name.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.560
No, I have to say though that Funhaus was awesome.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.560
It was kind of funny, though, because some of the prizes that they had to get, they had to stick through their head with, like, Velcro.

52:24.560 --> 52:29.560
It was like they'd have giant, like, boxes with the brand new Nintendo system.

52:29.560 --> 52:35.560
So they'd just, you know, stick that through their head and they'd have to run out and they'd get, like, cash and money and prizes and shit.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
It was awesome. That show was awesome.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.560
Ah, you'll appreciate this one, Jamie. I know you knew this show.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.560
Skyline's asking if you remember a show called Out of This World.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.560
Yes.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.560
It was, ding!

52:45.560 --> 52:47.560
You put your fingers together and...

52:47.560 --> 52:51.600
Okay in my life journal one of my old icons was Troy her dad

52:55.860 --> 53:02.460
Showed the 280 shows I remember because they used to be on my wedding small wonder. Thank you very much that show is the shit

53:03.280 --> 53:07.200
And the the girl I used to actually have a crush on punky Brewster

53:10.560 --> 53:12.080
Soleil moon fry

53:12.080 --> 53:16.480
Dude, did you hear Soleil moon for I had to get a boob job. She got her boobs reduced because they were so big

53:16.480 --> 53:21.360
I just couldn't believe that that Punky Brewster had big tits because you know when when you saw her she had no tits

53:21.880 --> 53:23.880
She was five

53:25.760 --> 53:27.760
Twelve

53:31.920 --> 53:32.940
You know speaking

53:32.940 --> 53:38.120
We're kind of been talking about game shows and TV shows you ever hear those rumors a while back that they were filming a pilot for

53:38.120 --> 53:44.040
A Dance Dance Revolution game show which has to be the dumbest idea. I've ever heard in my entire life

53:44.040 --> 53:47.040
Code of Crap!

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
Exactly, it's not even a bad joke.

53:49.040 --> 53:53.040
You know, that took off as well as, uh, the DDR Movie?

53:53.040 --> 53:56.040
No, it was the DDR Freak movie, remember?

53:56.040 --> 53:59.040
Yes, it was a movie called DDR Freak.

53:59.040 --> 54:02.040
I've seen the supposed script for it and it was bullshit.

54:02.040 --> 54:07.040
Was that the script that started at Milpitas Golf Land?

54:07.040 --> 54:12.040
Because that was like, faker than Elizabeth Berkley's moves.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.640
least moves i tried

54:14.640 --> 54:15.860
who wrote that again

54:15.860 --> 54:20.800
uh... i'm pretty sure it was one of the south bay folks but i i i actually tried

54:20.800 --> 54:22.800
at the time to get the script for it

54:22.800 --> 54:26.080
however the only way you can get

54:26.080 --> 54:28.040
was it

54:28.040 --> 54:29.580
uh... i think i thought it was

54:29.580 --> 54:32.040
uh... the name popping in my head was nashi

54:32.040 --> 54:36.280
i'm sure it's somebody that's now banned from d r freak anyways and for writing

54:36.280 --> 54:39.600
that piece of crap you deserved it i'm just kidding i actually i tried getting

54:39.600 --> 55:01.600
You know, I almost wanted to sign up for that just because I wanted to know. I wanted to know how fake this shit was.

55:01.600 --> 55:05.600
Someone posted the whole script on DDR Freak. You could just go click the link and get it.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.600
Really? I thought it was fake, though.

55:07.600 --> 55:11.600
It was in a thread. The supposed script, it was on there.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.600
Interesting.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.600
Yeah, well, it was crap.

55:16.600 --> 55:22.600
I would have liked to see it made. To be honest, I've seen worse made, and it's actually sold.

55:22.600 --> 55:27.600
I think they could make a DDR movie, but not that group that was trying to do it.

55:27.600 --> 55:31.600
What the fuck did you do to pay money to be in a movie?

55:31.600 --> 55:33.600
Let me go over a couple.

55:33.600 --> 55:36.600
Pay money to audition? That's lame.

55:36.600 --> 55:41.600
A couple actual movies that are out here. Let's just see here.

55:41.600 --> 55:46.600
Spectrum Entertainment, they're an awesome company that services anything that they get their hands on.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.600
And I mean anything.

55:48.600 --> 55:52.600
Let's see, we've got Anklebiters, the all midget vampire movie.

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
That one's great.

55:53.600 --> 56:09.600
We have one that's called Night Chills. It's about this guy that plays Dungeons and Dragons and then all of a sudden people are getting killed that play Dungeons and Dragons by this guy that's dressed up like a giant knight in armor suit thing. It's crap.

56:09.600 --> 56:13.000
And then there's another one called Envy, full title Penis Envy.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.400
It's about these two chicks that are wandering through the desert,

56:15.400 --> 56:16.840
and they just decide, you know what?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.840
Our lives would be a lot better if we had penises.

56:18.840 --> 56:19.640
So what happens?

56:19.640 --> 56:24.120
This giant drag queen fairy just saw the penis fairy goes,

56:24.120 --> 56:26.240
oh, you all have penises now.

56:26.240 --> 56:30.520
And it's a couple hours of them just doing shit with their penises

56:30.520 --> 56:31.720
and growing mustaches.

56:31.720 --> 56:34.160
And it's just really nasty shit.

56:34.160 --> 56:37.080
And at the very end of the movie, they make a trip down to LA

56:37.080 --> 56:42.560
to meet the penis fairy again and to get it removed and the ends of tragedy as one of

56:42.560 --> 56:46.920
the girls gets shot and killed. I just really didn't care. There's no plot to the movie

56:46.920 --> 56:51.760
at all other than what would happen if two white trash hookers got penises and started

56:51.760 --> 56:58.360
right around screwing the white trash redneck locals there and yadda yadda yadda yadda.

56:58.360 --> 57:02.360
And for some reason no one notices that they're chicks with mustaches with giant dicks.

57:02.360 --> 57:06.600
Did they have boobs too? They had boobs and dicks?

57:06.600 --> 57:12.280
Yeah, that would appear and disappear at will. It's, like, fucking weird, okay?

57:12.280 --> 57:16.520
This weird shit that this company pays for, and people fucking buy this shit.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.120
I'm like... You did.

57:18.120 --> 57:23.880
Apparently. No, I got it for free. I don't buy that shit. But you watched it, you wasted two hours of your life.

57:23.880 --> 57:29.080
Well, hell dude, I gotta see how crappy this... You wanted to see Chicks with Dicks.

57:29.080 --> 57:32.000
Hey, listen, I collect bad movies. Chicks with Dicks!

57:32.000 --> 57:36.320
I actually have a collection of the worst movies known to man, and I actually go out

57:36.320 --> 57:38.380
of my way to find these movies and buy them.

57:38.380 --> 57:44.120
The next two movies that I have being sent to me are Feeders 2, Rated 1, the lowest rated

57:44.120 --> 57:49.840
movie ever watched on something-awful.com, so I'm getting that movie.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.920
Don't forget Manos, The Hands of Fate.

57:51.920 --> 57:56.400
Oh, God, that movie is so bad, it put me to sleep watching it on the Mystery Science Theater

57:56.400 --> 57:57.400
3000 version.

57:57.400 --> 58:02.400
It was so bad that Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch it.

58:02.400 --> 58:05.400
It was awful.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.400
And then there was also, what other ones did we get?

58:08.400 --> 58:11.400
Oh, of course, Wild Zero is pretty bad.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.400
That Japanese rock and roll punk.

58:13.400 --> 58:19.400
It was a punk rock zombie alien movie with some chick that was a guy.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.400
Weird shit.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.400
I don't know.

58:23.400 --> 58:27.400
What other movies did I watch that were really crappy?

58:27.400 --> 58:30.400
Let me see here.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.400
We had one. He came from Planet K.

58:32.400 --> 58:39.400
I had one really funny part in it where the alien walked up to this guy who got shot, picked up his gun,

58:39.400 --> 58:44.400
shot him in the leg, killed his leg, shot him in his leg again, killed his leg, shot him in the leg again.

58:44.400 --> 58:48.400
That was just hilarious at the time.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.880
So now what's your plan? How are we gonna convince this company that they need to make a DDR movie?

58:53.720 --> 58:57.120
Now I just made it to them. They're all it's done. Okay, we'll take well

58:57.120 --> 59:00.000
So are we gonna have to have Jamie star in the movie and like grow a dick?

59:02.000 --> 59:03.880
No

59:03.880 --> 59:05.800
Do we have to do some stunts like that?

59:05.800 --> 59:11.580
I use twin. I think I think you need some like up skirt panty cam stuff going there

59:11.580 --> 59:17.980
maybe a zombie just for kicks maybe some topless chicks and an exploding toilet

59:17.980 --> 59:23.180
and people who can't act to save their life oh yeah do it so we should all star

59:23.180 --> 59:32.180
in it dude they should make they should make DDR freak the porno dude you could

59:32.180 --> 59:36.140
cast like a bunch of hot Japanese chicks just playing DDR and how you sex on the

59:36.140 --> 59:43.140
DDR freak and hot Japanese people are not like two things that can be used in the same

59:43.140 --> 59:44.140
sex.

59:44.140 --> 59:45.140
Fine!

59:45.140 --> 59:49.660
Uh, DDR sex freaks or something like that, there you go.

59:49.660 --> 59:56.140
First of all, there's already hentai art done involving a dance pad that I've seen one picture

59:56.140 --> 59:58.180
because someone posted it somewhere.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.700
I have not had the urge to go look for it, but I know it exists.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.220
Why does it seem like that all of our conversations seem to stray back to porn?

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220
That's alright.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.220
It gets ratings.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.660
I just don't know what it is.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.820
Yeah, it's a little strange.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820
3-2-N-E.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.460
But yeah, there were some really bad movies.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:23.340
There's one that was like an American vampire, and that was with Carmen Electra.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.380
And she was like some vampire, and then there was even...

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.420
They actually had a part in this movie, a track that you can listen to, that was making

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.420
fun of the movie.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:39.180
so bad. They had a track, an audio track where people were making fun of the movie. I was

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:44.080
just like, okay. Interesting. Well, I think we need to make that our mission, is we need

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.880
to make an actual DDR movie. Orange Lounge, the motion picture. How about it? Let's break

01:00:50.880 --> 01:01:01.360
out the 8mm cam. Jamie, take off your top. No, Rob. It's for artistic purposes. No, no,

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:08.360
No, Rob. No. I have a yo-yo.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.360
Man, if only I hadn't gotten rid of my hooker hook up there, man. I could have, like, been

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360
like, oh!

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360
Wait, you knew a hooker or something?

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.360
Well, we can go into this story.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.360
Oh, God. All right. Why not? We've got three hours to film now.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.360
Okay. This is a story of how I accidentally met a hooker. And one can say, accidentally.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:35.760
How does one accidentally meet a hooker? Well, it's quite interesting actually and here's here's how it goes. Okay, one day

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.760
I decided, you know, I took a Friday off and I needed to get my hair cut because you know

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.520
It kind of gets long sometimes so I got my hair cut and everything and this is during the summer ones

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.540
You just got a haircut or you got them all cut, huh?

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.480
Worst joke ever anyway, yeah first I went and got one cut then I realized oh they didn't do it

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.320
So anyway, so I got done getting my hair cut and I'm about to turn off from

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:03.320
Folsom Hair, which is obviously Folsom around here in the Sacramento area.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:12.320
So I was about to turn off to go home, and it looks like, I swear to God, she couldn't have been that old.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.320
I thought she was a high school student and looked like her little brother.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.320
So she's like, can we get a ride down the street to our apartment?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320
She was in high school, I swear!

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.060
That's why I thought it was, and they're like, it's kinda hot out here, can we get a ride

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060
down to our apartment?

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.060
I'm like, where do you guys live?

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.060
Oh, just Creekside.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.620
I was like, oh okay, cause it was like a couple blocks down the street.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620
So I was fine.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.500
So they got in the car, and so I couldn't quite make the left to go to Creekside, which

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.400
was two blocks to go around the block.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:48.600
So we go around the block and stuff, and her kid, who I found out was her son, was playing

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.460
around in the backseat, cause I had a bunch of anime movies back there and stuff.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.580
And she was talking to me, and she kept hitting on me.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:56.700
She's all, she's all, so, what are you doing, lady?

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.660
Do you want, do you want to go out tonight?

01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.500
There was stuff like that.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.460
Hey, baby.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.300
Stuff like that.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.500
I was like, I'm all, uh, now I got a girlfriend, you know,

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.260
I, I'm actually, you know, we're going out later and stuff,

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.780
so I took her back to her place, and she's all, she's all,

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.620
can I give you gas money?

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.780
Yeah, Loki has a girlfriend that hates DDR.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:20.620
Yeah, I'm just messing with you.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.620
No, no, no. She'll play DDR just when I'm not there.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.620
She played it, like, once in, uh, Tahoe. Oh, anyways, back to the story with the hooker.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.620
So, so, she...

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.620
Oh, so we... I take her back to her apartment, and she's like,

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.620
Here, let me give you gas money. No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620
And she's all, well...

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.620
Wait, so a hooker was gonna pay you?

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.620
What?

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.620
She was gonna pay me for gas money to give her a ride to her house.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.620
Oh, right. Gas money. Gas money. Yes, okay, yes.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.620
I refused the gas money because it was like...

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:53.780
I refuse the gas money because you know it was you know only if you were being a

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.180
good samaritan. I was being a good samaritan. It was only a few blocks and it was like

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:01.780
You were helping your fellow hooker. I didn't know she was a hooker, okay? We haven't

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:05.500
gotten to the part where I figured out she was a hooker. Right now I thought she was

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:12.540
some she and now she was. SoCalKick says she needed a fill up. Hey she was okay

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:18.420
she was pretty hot okay and she was no she's like I thought she was just some

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.000
really

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.540
really desperate single mom who wanted some action or some shit like that so

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.940
if i happen to look like she was in high school

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.420
at the time yes you look pretty young so

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.640
i i i place her anywhere from like

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.740
seventeen that twenty

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.500
low twenty range so

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.620
i'm not good with age

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.660
shipment nowadays in the pocket twelve-year-olds look like sixteen-year-old

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.620
so what am i supposed to judge anyway had to finish is ok

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.120
so

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.680
i did refuse my since you are here you are you are set up

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.480
so i was like

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.560
okay so

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.920
i went to our apartment probably mistake number one here warps

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.980
yeah all you were forced in a gunpoint into our apartment

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.120
i was not forced i wanted to get them so that i don't know all shit all you

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.520
wanted to taste the sweet juice yes

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.760
couple eight

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.200
went to apartment

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.000
phone rang

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.140
right when we got in there so

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.060
actually is kind of weird because i think quite you know

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:19.660
realize it at first but she told her son to go play because mommy was

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.780
working for some like that

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.500
hot

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.300
anyway so we went to the apartment

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.040
nagata said uh... and she was no

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.260
phone rings so

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.000
i just sat down drinking soda

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.920
and then like

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.280
midway out of

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.900
but you know works against is their mom on the phone

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.420
with her head over the phone

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.860
what that means that

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.780
do you want to blow job mike

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.460
uh...

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.220
no

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.740
what kind of man are you you know i said

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:55.680
but i said no that's morally said yes i want to blow job but not from you you

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.020
stinky or

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.780
so anyways so i said no she got the phone she cut it

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.620
explain to me how she was working she she thought i was like afraid that she

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.080
was a cop or something so

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.080
She pulls down her shirt to show me her tits, and says, you know...

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080
Oh! How nice!

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.080
So there was some gratification in that.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080
Oh, yeah. Got a nice brush on.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.080
Your reward!

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.080
A reward, I guess. But she was just trying to prove to me that she wasn't wired or some shit like that.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.080
So I was like, oh, no, that's really alright.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.080
And this is where I probably should have just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080
Yeah, just get me the hell out of here.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.080
But she got to see some titties, so now you were kind of wondering what's going to happen next.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.640
yes about it

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.980
so i just like okay now i i can't do that so

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.400
so she's like okay

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.160
will cast another favor i might

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.540
uh... right what's i need a ride down to ranch itself like

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.100
okay five that's on my way home so i was gonna get a ride down to rancho for some

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:52.920
reason

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.500
it's a good out fifty

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.420
and uh...

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.040
during the way she's no

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.840
talk to me and shit and she's like yeah

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.560
still try to push the whole she wants

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.080
to give me a blowjob thing

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.940
and okay

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.580
I mean, right after refusing so many times you'd think I'd say yes, but just for some

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.360
reason I still said no.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.140
And so, she started explaining the whole basic business structure of prostitution, which

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.980
is quite interesting actually.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.700
Was she talking about her boss?

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:26.140
No, actually she was the pimp.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.140
Which is quite weird.

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.780
It was a really strange infrastructure she's got going there.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:56.780
She's basically fine, you know, like, she's all, she's really easy to become, like, you know, pink. She's all, she's got to basically find women that are walking around, don't, you know, know where they're going or what, they'll look lost and stuff, and you just say you'll take care of them, that you can make, they can make lots of money and that kind of shit, and right now it's kind of tuning her out and listening to the radio, but, um, she, then she started talking about, like, how she, like, had a bunch of apartments in different places and stuff like that, and just crazy stuff.

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.580
So I took her to Rancho and she wanted, she saw some like other hooker walking around

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580
like

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.580
A hooker buddy!

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:08.320
She wanted me to come, she wanted me to like come get this hooker that'd be like my hooker,

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.900
like I'd be the pimp for this hooker, and I'm like no that's alright, I'm all, I'm all,

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:18.020
I'm all, I gotta, and then she wanted to give me her pager number so in case I had any friends.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020
Now I thought about

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.980
Like refer a friend to the wonderful world of whoredom

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:30.420
off the top. I was like, maybe not. So then she got out of my car finally and that's why

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.060
I sped off and went back home.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.260
Okay, now the question about all this. How the fuck does this have anything to do with

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.260
I don't know about Imani.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.260
Did we actually talk about Imani all day?

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:51.260
Well shit, we're almost halfway through the show and we haven't talked about Imani.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.260
Oh boy, okay.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.260
Well, anything else to add to your little wonderful wide world of whoredom story there?

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:04.260
She also thought that I didn't want to blowjob her because she was black.

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.260
She tried to pull the race card on me.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:42.500
you can get to the chatroom from there or if you want to send them over email, that's

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:49.600
certainly possible as well. Just send an email to orangeloungeloungeradio.com. You guys send

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
those right now.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
No, you want to.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.360
We're going to start off this break with something from Max USA, I think. It sounds like a good

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.200
idea. So, let's hear a song from Max USA and then we're going to come back and do the F-You's

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.800
of the week and we're going to work an erotic song into this break too because it's pretty

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.800
So, we'll see you guys in a little bit.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.120
If you need to rise to a convention, rise away

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.840
Time's counting, the rhythm is a part of the music

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.360
We gotta get with it, the pain is centering

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.420
All my heart, even do it now, you're just a tango

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.300
Oh, yes, I ready to take that fall

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.560
If you need to make the call, then drop the ball

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.840
Get your hands off the ball

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.040
Drop the ball

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.160
Let me see that ball

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.080
Young God, you spilled my medicine

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.080
If you need to rise to a convention, rise away

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.760
The sun's bouncing, the rhythm's the march, the system's the winner

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.800
The pain is staring, all my heart is a-doin'

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.000
Now you must stand, go slower

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.440
The odds are raised to take that fall

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.440
And it's up to you to take that call

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880
To drop the ball

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.080
To drop the ball

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
To drop the ball

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:43.460
Before we get into the next song, a real quick request, JB in the chat room wants to hear

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:50.460
Jamie say, poopy on JB's mommy. Poopy on JB's mommy. Big piles of feces.

Gonna make me feel like you're not in the screen, yeah

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:54.020
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.020
Do we want to be summoned by Hollywood?

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.020
No!

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.020
Do we care what people think of us?

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.020
No!

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.020
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.020
Yes!

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:14.020
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:20.020
You're listening to, uh, Porridge Lounge Radio, as somebody in the chatroom referred to it earlier.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:23.020
It's porn-tastic. It's fat-tastic.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.020
Makes my math wolta.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.020
Where we don't talk about the money ever on this program. That's just a sideshow.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.020
To DDR? Ha, ha, ha. Not here.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:42.020
Anyway, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I know is Jamie's favorite segment, right?

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.020
Teehee.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.020
Is this your favorite part of the show? Yes?

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.020
One of them.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.020
One of them.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:19:04.020
Alright, this is the FU of the week where Jamie just goes off on something that pisses her off and then we all play along. We all talk about things that piss us off. So, without further ado, Jamie, what the hell is pissing you off this time?

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:11.020
First thing that pisses me off is the fact that I've been using the same version of Slagwort. So, I think in the future we should use the, quote, Terror Mix.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:18.020
then

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.900
early this morning

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.540
i was over here watching

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.180
showgirls

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.900
are

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.540
over here watching

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.360
went live on the show

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.180
which we do occasionally which is a more incentive to listen to our money is

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.580
more program twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, on this station.

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:40.980
Anyway,

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.060
I get home.

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:48.080
I knew Dan was going to be having people over for that piece of shit Xbox Live crap.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.340
I go in there and there's like everybody and God in my living room. God was in

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.140
your living room? Well, no. Amazing. Because if God were there, he wouldn't be playing the Xbox.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:02.660
Anyway, he'd be too busy smiting people. He'd be playing Animal Crossing.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.660
Where everybody can be a god.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.660
Anyway, I go, and there's just all this stuff, and I'm exhausted.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:14.660
Look upstairs, just like through PBX, and then, and then Bailey will walk in, um, and...

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.660
Ryan, Black Lab.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.660
...

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.660
I didn't... Yeah, it's Black Lab.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:26.660
Um, they, they go through, they look like, uh, I don't know, like, pretty hyper, but Robert, like, he was about to...

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.660
I was tired.

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.660
Rise from your grave!

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.660
It was very hyper.

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.660
Did you hear that candy you ate?

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.660
No, it was actually caffeine.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.660
Anyway, this is my fuck you, so leave your candy out of it.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:48.660
Anyway, I go downstairs and say, okay, one last game.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Dan goes, no!

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.660
You knew we were going to be here.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.660
Weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:01.660
How inconsiderate, you know? I come home, and I'm tired.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.660
Was it his time of the month?

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.660
Yeah, it must have been.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.660
He had the Oreo coke bowl with him.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:18.660
Anyway, I admit I came home late, and that's one thing.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:22.660
I would have thought that they would have wrapped it up by then, or would have just wrapped it up.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:27.660
You came home late out of consideration for the party because you didn't want to see no stinkin' Xboxes

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.660
because they're just giant paperweights.

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:34.660
Instead I come home and there's five TVs in my living room and three Xboxes hooked up

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.660
and they're playing some stupid mecha ball game.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.660
Mecha balls?

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:45.660
No, like you go to the one that's captured with five and you have to kick the balls off.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.660
It's really stupid.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.660
They were playing with balls obviously.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.660
And it was fucking loud.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.660
You've got a bunch of men in your living room playing with balls.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.660
Yes.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.660
Just checking.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:00.660
So, I went upstairs and tried to make my icons, and I made like two Draco Malfoy ones.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.660
I was like, this sucks.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:09.660
So, this is what, you know, I thought that maybe he was going to be considerate and, you know, have everybody go home.

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:11.660
And then this is what I hear.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.660
Okay, one more game!

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:15.660
Fuck!

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.660
I'm upstairs going, go home!

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:18.660
You heard me!

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:28.660
I was like, it's just going to come, I'm going to get out of my house, I want to go to bed, I would not have been able to go to bed with all of that bullshit going on.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:33.660
And I was fucking tired. Okay, I had been up all, for a while.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.660
You need to have your revenge. You need to have people over.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.660
I've never been money party at my apartment.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.660
No, you need to have people over for a gem marathon.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:45.660
Yes.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:49.660
No, I'll just have another good money party at the apartment.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:54.660
And the last one we had, what, 20 people showed up?

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.660
Yeah, that's a lot of people.

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.660
In my living room!

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:04.660
Which, you know, the living room, you know, it's probably, it's a two bedroom, you only

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.660
have really a one, no, you have a two bedroom apartment.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.660
I have a two bedroom, but it's a two story apartment.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.660
Sort of like a townhouse, but not quite.

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:16.660
Anyway, you know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but it really pissed me off.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:21.660
And he's like mad at me for being mad at me, and I'm like, huh?

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.660
Excuse me?

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:30.660
You know, I've got it out of my system now. I'd love a little world where my displeasure is if you lose it through my live journal.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.660
I want all the Xbox balls to die.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:37.660
A big thank you to Xbox for ruining Jamie's life.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:55.660
Fuck you, Gates. I hope you die. May your breaks fail on the freeway and you go off of a cliff and land in a gigantic tank of sulfuric acid and dissolve slowly for hours until you finally die.

01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:02.660
And then I hope your soul doesn't go to hell or doesn't go to heaven. I hope you're stuck in purgatory where you're bored forever.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:06.660
My, are you done ranting? Are you finished?

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.660
Excuse me, world! This is my segment, hello.

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.660
You know, all of your little input is just, you know, consequence. This is my segment.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.660
It's funny, you just had to, like, reset the little F.U. song, like, three times by now.

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.660
I'm the ranty bitch of the show, I'm alone.

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.660
That's right, that's my role on the program. Music bitch.

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:33.660
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:42.660
This is just, ugh, okay, I'm over, I'm good being seen without it. I've made several noises of the treasure.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:48.660
Okay, breathe in, breathe out, do some yoga, drink some boba, feel better.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:53.660
I get boba every night. This is a good fucking night. Anyway, next!

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.660
Alright, moving along.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.660
Loki!

01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.660
Alright, how can you possibly follow up that porn story?

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.660
Oh!

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.660
Um, let's see.

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.660
Well, I have to give a big F to my cold, which is now gone, thank god.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:18.660
But it lasted too long, and it was annoying, so thank god it's gone.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:27.660
I'm a big f-you to the putters at Golf Land because they keep chipping my shots.

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.660
Every time I hit the ball it goes flying up in the air.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.660
I have to add to that because they're like made crooked.

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:41.660
I swear to God they are. I mean, I've looked at all of them when I worked there, and if you actually hold the putter up and look at it, the faces are crooked.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.660
You can't putt straight with those things. They're made to fuck with you like that.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:52.660
Yeah, see, they make the putters, just like they make all of the clubs. See, they go straight and then they turn, so you can hit the ball.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.660
But I think that you meant the shaft.

01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.660
No one likes a crooked shaft.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.660
Like, how's it hanging? A little bent right now. Crooked.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.660
It's all shrivels and two left.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.660
That's actually a real, like, controller.

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.660
A crooked shaft.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:14.600
uh...

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.500
another

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.520
yet the right to go back to it

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.520
can i finish thank you again i think that

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.520
now uh...

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.940
that if you go to the polls and like all the for being one of the devil

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.480
pulling out the fact that it's still going on

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.000
but it's very kiddo

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.860
i think they're called

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.380
uh... little homies

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.380
So I bought one, it's a stupid little thing that comes in above the wall.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.380
Oh dude, the homies dolls, I know what you're talking about, they're cool.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:50.380
So I took one of those and I took it to Golfland, and I wanted the homie to go down the rapids,

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.380
cause you know, that's what the homie's gonna do when the ball is go down the fucking rapids.

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.380
So I threw him up in the fountain and the fucking homie got stuck in the middle of the fountain

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:02.380
and the goddamn thing couldn't get it back and my homie's gone!

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:14.700
So anyways, an F.E. to the fountain that stole my homie, and uh, let's see, and uh, on top

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.700
of that, that'd be the prize for making me spend $200 there, for putting stuff very cheap

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.660
in uh, they had 40 speed CD burners for $19 there, how awesome is that?

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.660
I mean...

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.660
Good brand?

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:33.840
It was pretty decent, but I ended up buying a $129 one because it was Yamaha, and it burns

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.680
these really cool disc tattoo things that you can't see on normal discs, and they tell

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.840
you that in the manual, not on the outside of the box, so that kind of sucks.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.880
F.D. and me were buying two Saturns and Kords for one, because I bought one from Denyos

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.640
from this chick that couldn't speak English, but it was $10, so I was like, okay.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:59.640
And then this other one was like 75 and came with games and chords and shit, so I bought that and it was awesome.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.640
But yeah, F.U., that stupid chick couldn't speak English because she's the only one who speaks English.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.640
She lives in freaking the United States! Speak English, dammit!

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.640
We don't speak Italian here! English!

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.640
So, yeah.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:22.640
Aside from that, F.U. and my mom for making me listen to this stupid, like, spa music tape on the way down the denials.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:31.640
Okay, this guy, he took a cover, I mean, he was covering, like, for a release, and, uh, he called it Imagine.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.640
I don't know if he was able to record it, so that's good.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:43.640
Oh my God, I have some really weak FUs this week. Uh, FU for me not being a good FU.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.640
Yeah, fuck you. Play my music.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.640
And F-you to my fucking, this coworker of mine, Linda,

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.640
Freakin' keeps telling me to get back to work and stop, you know, browsing the internet

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.640
when I have like the highest phone time out of the company, you know,

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.640
and I took like 400 calls in like one day and shit, which is pretty huge, and

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.640
and she just has the nerve to like start, you know, bitching at me about being on the phone.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.640
Then she goes back and starts talking with the other girl who's not on the phone,

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.640
talking about, like, her boyfriend, or some guy that she thought was cute and had a nice

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640
ass, and I'm just like, shit.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:26.640
So yeah, I have to get her, and that's it. I'm good.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:38.640
I have a couple FUs this week, believe it or not.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640
No!

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:47.640
My first FU goes to anybody I've ever gone out clubbing with before, because I've always had to drive in the past.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.640
But this week, I got to be a participant in the drinking festivities when I went out to the bar.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:59.640
I got so drunk off my ass, I had to be carried out of the bar, and I had so much fun that I've just been missing out all these years.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.640
So, F people who always make me be the designated driver.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.640
A big FU to Politary, I hate you.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.640
Um, yes.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.640
Everybody knows your collar is covered.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.640
They're probably trying to do you a favor.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.640
F you, lady.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.640
No!

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:18.640
What's up on your foot?

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Ow!

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.640
Watch out or I'll like, kick your face in.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.640
Like, what's your face?

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.640
Uh, a big F you to my 2DX controller.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.640
You're a piece of shit and I hate you.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:41.640
that

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.320
and uh... i think if you did colors for the same reason

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.440
your position

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.400
uh...

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.440
if you do whatever called me during the show that was embarrassing

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.400
uh...

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.480
if you did anyone that doesn't live in sacramento because you live in a better

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.920
place i'm sure

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.560
no separate a visit

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:10.400
and she goes up to the public

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.840
you're right i'm sorry

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.860
and florida's also exempt from that because you have to add

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:18.000
all right so that's not that

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.840
they still met the fucking ballot calendar

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.800
or like uh... governor race

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.200
good doctor

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.120
working

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.120
Chad's! What's a Chad? What's that poop in the frickin' home for?

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:36.120
I swear to God, they're so stupid that- Oh. Yeah, they're stupid.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:41.120
Stupid old people that live in Florida. Old people suck. That'd be the old people.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:46.120
Watch it die! No one wants you around! It's why they're sitting in Florida! Just go die!

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:51.120
Die! No one misses you! Die! They'll make room for more resorts!

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.120
Florida is like the gateway to hell. It's like when I keep all the old people that wait to die.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.120
Actually, hell is really close to there. It's a small little island, but yeah.

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.120
We can see hot people every day.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:11.120
Oh, and F you to Spazzy, who's in the shower right now, because he got to go see hot people last night, and I didn't, and I'm jealous. So F you.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120
Okay, that's it. You get my turn now?

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.120
Yes, it's your turn, Dave.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.120
No, I I get my song

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.680
my son

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:25.680
Literally, um, okay. I don't really have that many of you

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.320
But many of them are like Rob

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:32.560
Okay, first that's you to my parents for not wanting to take me out here

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:38.320
I have to uh, I actually have to stop that for a minute because I have to thank Dave parents for the taquitos. Oh

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.280
Okay

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.720
That's all tacos the taquitos

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.080
Okay

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.080
That was horrible, die!

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.080
Hehe, I...

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.080
The tackle you...

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:59.080
Ok, anyway, fuck them for not wanting to take me out here, and for making me read a hundred pages of a shitty-ass book today so I could come.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.080
Because a yellow raft in blue water is crap. I hate reading.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:27.080
And then, I also have Fuck You's to many QDX songs which I can't pass, such as Star Mine for the fucking last two seconds of it, because it has like 20 notes at once, and I always get down to 58% or whatever it is when you miss all of them, so fuck that, and fuck all the seven stars that I can't pass.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.080
Okay. I think that's it. That's it.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080
It's Raining Men.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.080
Fuck this song. Oh, wait, no.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.080
And fuck Twen, because he said that he wanted to be fucked.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080
No, and he said that he wanted to be-

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.080
Whatever makes you happy.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.080
He said that he wanted to be everyone's fuck you, so.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080
All right.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080
And now we're-

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.080
Is there any way he can get it?

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.080
And now we're going to go to Black Lab's FUs.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.080
And this song is meant to be ironic.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.080
It's the cat song.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.080
Yay.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:01.080
Okay, first, fuck this song. Because it's about cats. I would have rather heard who

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.280
let the dogs out than this. I can arrange that song.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:12.280
Dude, it's a pussy song, okay? Like it. No. Okay, let's see. First of all, I think

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:18.400
it's due to my FUs of last week, so fuck that. Because I was not around. I was at home, most

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.640
of the weekend. Yeah, you had a birthday or something that you think's more important.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.640
Oh, shut up, Robin!

01:34:52.640 --> 01:35:07.640
I gotta kinda give F you to my nosey little roommate because just before I left for the weekend, last weekend, I found out that he found my live journal and read through every single entry.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.640
And that kinda pissed me off.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.640
Really?

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.640
It's on the internet. It's not private.

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.640
No, but the fact is is that-

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:21.640
But there's more to it.

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:28.640
there's more to it

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.640
They kind of had the consensus that I was going to go snap and fucking kill them because of all the ranting I do in my live journal.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640
Just say yes.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:09.640
The fact that they actually went through and started using it against me was really irk me.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:19.640
And then my roommate actually went and decided to instant message a couple of my friends from my friends list asking about this stuff.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.640
And it was like, okay, that's just getting a bit too fucking nosy.

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.640
And that really pissed me off.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.640
I think that's the first time anyone's ever said irk on this show.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.640
I beg to differ. I believe I would have said that word in the past. Come on.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.640
I like irks.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:37.640
Irk. Like irkle.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640
I think I already said it before.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640
I will have to check the archives soon.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.640
Anyway, Black Lapis is continuing.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:42.640
Yes.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.640
This is a fuse, please.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.640
How does that continue?

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.640
Uh, let's see.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:37:00.640
Fuck the dining halls at Davis, because you serve the same food over and over again, and I'm sick of it already, and next time I eat there, I swear I'm going to puke all over the table there.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.640
What? No, let him finish. Let me finish, dammit! I'm just...

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640
Let him move!

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.640
No. Let Twin move.

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.640
p0k3smot42o i like the rain for messing up this wheel on my bike so that now my brakes don't work

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:40.400
p0k3smot42o

01:37:40.400 --> 01:38:09.400
p0k3smot42o I played for 10 or 11 straight hours before I decided, oh shit, I think I need to get some sleep. So I slept for 2 hours, and then went and played some more. And I still want to go back and play more now.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:36.680
p0k3smot42o

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.400
FU2 Old Navy. That place is Satan.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:49.400
It's just... it's evil. I hate the commercials. I hate the old stars that get on there.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.400
For the stupid commercials, I wish they'd all go to hell.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.400
And then the whole place, when you walk in there, it's just like one big giant Old Navy commercial.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.400
It's like... it's like so ANNOYING! I hate them!

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.400
And the only reason I went there to buy clothes was because I had a fucking gift certificate for $50.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.400
I thought I spent all the money on the gift certificate because I was trying to get out there as quick as possible.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.400
And then I got there. Oh, you have $6 left in your cart! DAMMIT! NOOOO!

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.400
I'm gonna have to go back there and shop more.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.400
No matter what, they're just gonna keep me there! No!

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.400
Anyways, that's it.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.400
Looks like he's being sleepy.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:40.400
I've had a vanilla coke and my chocolate cupcake and I still have to be tired.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:13.500
dscs f me sky for making him work fuck being sick for almost two weeks fuck the doctors

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.040
for scaring him about possibly having tuberculosis and fuck homework

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.040
Fuck you to the doctor, which you don't know won't kill you.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:31.040
Twins says, uh, fuck you to lesbians, fuck you to chicks without dicks, fuck you to chicks without tits.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:37.040
Hey, hey, hey, okay, no titted chicks need lovin' to you, okay?

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:44.040
He said, F you to chicks without dicks.

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:51.040
Anywho, uh, fuck you to Loki for not giving him the pager number to that hooker.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.680
I don't have the pager number, so how can I give it to you?

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.680
Uh, fuck you to still having his fucking cold, and fuck you to Mackintosh's.

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:09.440
And, Quinn, stop saying that, because I'll, like, hack your ass with my Mac, okay?

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.440
The Macs rule, bitch!

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:46.200

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:53.200
Baskin-Robbins system going on. Now serving number twenty-one. Number twenty-one. Fuck

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.720
you to Dave for not beating the ancient boy game. And fuck you to Vid Power for not letting

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.960
me plug his restaurant. Dude, that game is a bit. I played for maybe half an hour straight,

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:10.280
And I could get down to one little fucking egg with two cracks in it, and I couldn't

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280
beat it!

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.960
And it just bounced around and I hit it like thirty times back and forth, and it never

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.960
hit it.

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.580
It was such shit.

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:21.800
And then I was about to hit it, and then a pop-up window came and I lost!

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.960
Like fuck!

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.280
By the way, I'm being, I'm being told it's YOSPUB.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280
YOSPUB.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280
YOSPUB.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.280
Yeah, YOSPUB, it wasn't my fault.

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.280
How far have you gotten?

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.280
Go YOSPUB yourself.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.280
Anyway.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.440
Andrew says, what are the FUs for?

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.120
I have a private message, what are the FUs for?

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.600
Hopefully you're getting the hit by this point.

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.820
DCB says, no FU, he just wants to plug his tournament.

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:55.960
Fremont 2, January 11, 2003 at Funtime Pizza.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.800
He wants special FU music, but I didn't give it to him because I'm lazy.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:08.920
SkylineDC505 says, F you to HISP for not letting me get sleep and sucking at Shaft and getting

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.320
me sick this weekend, thanks.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:18.800
Dark Tetsuya says, fuck you to mom's work, that's why I miss Shaft.

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:22.720
Vid Pawa says, I don't have an F you of the week, but rather a thank you of the week.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:25.840
Oh, he has a thank you of the week, how nice.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.840
My thank you of the week goes to Cube Club, which is a public event sponsored by Nintendo

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.840
and Panasonic.

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:38.840
Basically, I played GameCube games and got free shit. Plus, I got a Nintendo wristband for beating total strangers at Mario Party 4, so thank you to the Cube Club!

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.840
Aw, wasn't that special?

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.840
I'm going to that Cube Club thing in, like, two weeks.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.840
I gotta take a...

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.840
Where's the Cube Club? I wanna go to the Cube Club.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.840
They're doing it in San Francisco, uh...

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.840
Are they gonna do it in Sacramento, I wonder?

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.840
I don't know if they're doing it in Sacramento.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.840
I wanna go to the Cube Club!

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.840
They're doing it in San Francisco on Thanksgiving weekend.

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.840
I'm going! Yeah!

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.840
I'm going to whoop some ass at Mario Party and give myself some free shit.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.840
See, what I'd do if I went to that thing is if someone started beating me at Mario Party, I'd just start kicking the ass of the person next to me.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.840
I'd be like, you don't want to do that. Fucker!

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.840
Vandalus says, fuck you to Pac Bell for not installing DSL in his area. Dial-up sucks.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.840
Crowny face.

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.840
Jomama says, fuck you to Toys R Us for being out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:30.840
For vandalism try win first try win first by the way you

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.000
Fuck you Gio because okay get this I

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.780
Know this is picky for me because being a Japanese major I go into the dance store to hang out sometimes

01:44:45.780 --> 01:45:13.140
I have a comic book, one of the, this is how comics come in Japan when they're new, they

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:17.500
come in a bound volume of different comics in one volume. Well, I have a Yu-Gi-Oh! one

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:27.500
from 1991, okay? It's old! Get over it! It's a show about playing a card game! It's fucking

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.500
old! Yay! Then again, there's also Hikaru no Go, which is about playing Go. The cards

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:38.300
come to life, and the, you know, but I think that the anime is like Pokemon except with

01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.620
cards

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.540
yeah and more strategy

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:44.100
which means it's just as lame as Pokemon

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:49.100
yeah but like the cards cost like four dollars a booster pack for some ridiculous amount of money

01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:52.020
so remember this, Digimon owes you. Watch it in Japanese.

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.020
Digimon, I've never seen the Japanese.

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.820
I have sweeties with you so I will show you.

01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:58.820
Oh, I remembered my F.U. now.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:05.700
F.U. to my back for looking all ugly and F.U. to me for being tall because now I have nasty ass stretch marks on my back.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.540
They're the most disgusting stretch marks of all time.

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.140
That was so pleasing to hear.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:12.660
No, they're so disgusting.

01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.300
I'll show you later.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.940
Right.

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.460
I have a few more chat rooms.

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:20.940
Two more chat rooms, Matthews, and then we're done.

01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:24.780
EOSFBB says his name changed time.

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.500
I did do him already, but I'm giving the correct pronunciation.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:33.900
It's EOSFBB, whatever.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:34.860
Okey-dokey.

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:38.860
And Andrew did submit an F.U. after all. He says F.U. Rob. Thank you.

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:39.860
Fuck you too, bitch.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.860
That's it. Oh, I have to check the mailbag.

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.860
Mailbox! I predict emptiness.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:50.860
Yeah, I predict emptiness too, but we're gonna check the mailbox.

01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:59.860
If they don't know where to send emails by now, they're out of luck.

01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.860
Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo Deck Inn.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:13.780

We're going to take another break.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:48.700
On that note, we're going to take a quick break and we will come back and at that point

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:53.580
we're going to do a little segment we call listless.

01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:58.300
And it's a five person listless tonight so it should be exciting.

01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:01.640
The topic is very interesting, that's all I have to say.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:06.000
So here we go, we're taking another quick break, we'll be back in a little bit, see

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.640
You

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:08.200
Saki no mienu tenka ini vasu ni sonai Iso mae lo mokigii kaga yo yo yo

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.380
Hey!

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:05.880
One, two, one, two, three, four!

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:25.580
This is the first time I saw this kind of reproduce in the magazine!

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.880
What do you think of the Orange Lounge main line of music in Moore's show?

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:46.880
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:52.880
It's unearthly. It's like being in a club except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:57.880
Hi. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're back.

01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.880
No one would dance with that guy even if he did ask.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.880
The only decent DDR film ever made, by the way.

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:09.180
Oh, that was fucking hilarious. Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Loki disagrees. That was stupid.

01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:12.780
He disagrees it was decent.

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:16.180
So let's do our list list. Let's do our list list.

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:20.280
Alright, tonight on list list

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:24.720
I gotta find tonight's theme music, but why don't you tell us about the topic,

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.000
Jamie, for tonight's list list.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.200
The topic is your favorite beverage to have while playing

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.520
a more active Bemani game, namely

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.520
DDR, Pada Pada, Dance Maniacs, or if you really get into it, Drum Mania.

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:43.520
You know, if you break a sweat playing 2DX, you know, all that wrist action.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.520
Some people have a very big experience in their wrist action, so that's a problem for them.

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.520
But...

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.520
You know, hey, I know people that freestyle playing 2DX, namely me. It's fun.

01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.520
So, I think that...

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.800
Let's explain, because this is the season premiere and we have some new people listening,

01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:05.800
let's explain what List List is.

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.440
And it's not List List, it's List Less.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:16.720
So List Less is the segment, now they get it, I just talk funny, I'm sorry.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:24.180
List Less, this list, this list, this list, this list, Corky, this segment of the show,

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:28.980
we make the definitive list on some topic and basically the way it works is that we're

01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.780
We're all going to name our top three, so we'll have a list of 15 beverages that are

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:39.200
great to play, that are great to drink while playing DDR, 2DX, whatever, and then we'll

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.580
all go around the room and everybody eliminates one thing from the list, and then the chat

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:51.020
room will vote to decide the ultimate DDR beverage, Bemani beverage.

01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:57.980
So that's how it works, and if you ever saw the old VH1 show, the list, nothing to do

01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:00.460
with it. Absolutely nothing to do with that. Nothing at all.

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:05.180
Okay, so... Wait, wait. That show is the stupidest fucking

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:11.160
show ever. Because, okay, they let the audience pick their favorite that gets put on the list,

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.060
but the audience already picked their favorite. So why wouldn't they just pick it again?

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.320
The reason why that show sucked is that Lauryn Hill somehow ended up on every single list

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:24.080
they ever did. It could be best male artist of the 80s, and Lauryn Hill was number one.

01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:25.240
every time

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:26.120
every time

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.080
no and needed one

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.720
good album one good album i mean let's check out the food you select you don't

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.040
cuz that wasn't so

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.320
but it was a whole nother and let's go for a little

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.800
all that they'll do it after the war in hill fans next week

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:42.120
uh... because i'm special off

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:43.880
my number three

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.720
is oxygenated water

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.000
oxygenated water i don't remember the brand but i bought oxygenated water one

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
time and I felt like absolutely freaking refreshed after it. It was really cool.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Do you guys see the same thing just by shaking up a bottle of water?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I mean, that's oxygenated.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.000
This is like super oxygenated water. I don't know. But it was kind of cool and I felt a little lightheaded.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
So, um, yeah. Next.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Ah, Loki, your number three choice for best beverage for baloney.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.240
I only really drink one thing, um, the rest are just gonna be what I would be drinking

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:25.240
if I wasn't drinking one thing. I'm gonna have to say a 40 ounce malt liquor.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:32.240
That's the winner. No need to have anything. Alright, 40 ounce malt liquor.

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.720
A freshy smooth malt 45. We're gonna have Billy D. Williams come out

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:41.880
and play DDR. Okay, now, uh...

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:43.880
Dave, you're number three Vic.

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:51.880
Yeah, um, I don't really drink too many varieties of drinks or soft drinks or power drinks or,

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:56.880
you know, sports drinks or whatever, but I know that one drink that gets me hyper as

01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:03.880
fuck so I can play keto and get all the way to Max X is Jolt, because that gets me so

01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:04.880
hyped up.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:05.880
Jolt!

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.880
All the sugar and twice the caffeine.

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.880
That's what got me through college by the way.

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:10.880
Yes.

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.880
Jolt. Okay, Black Lab, your number three choice for Best Pamani Beverage.

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:23.880
Alright, here. As you may not know, the only DDR machine in Davis is in a Tapioca Express.

01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.880
Excuse me.

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:33.880
So, appropriately enough, one of the drinks that I usually get every time I go in there would be a strawberry snow bubble for Tapioca Express.

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:35.880
It's kind of like a Slurpee.

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.880
So you're specifically stating a strawberry snow bubble?

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:38.880
Yes, I am.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.460
yes i am okay

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:41.900
just wanted to double check

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.700
well well

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:47.220
i know it'll get wiped out for these i just need something to fill space

01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.460
yeah it was

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:53.100
it's like kinda like a Slurpee except it's like they use like a special syrup in it

01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:59.500
and it's kinda like they use milk in it too so it's like milky and it's like really really really really good

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:03.980
and plus it's really good when you have taffy okay

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:06.460
alright strawberry snow bubble from black lab

02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:11.240
my number three pick for best mamani beverage and if you've ever

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:14.280
if you've ever been to one of my infamous house parties

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.360
you'll know why i'm naming this one

02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:23.360
my number three pick is goldschlager

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:26.960

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:30.360
is my number three pick and for the kitty that's all i have to say

02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:34.000
for all the kitties it basically tastes like um... drinking cough syrup but it

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.380
fucks you right up

02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:40.700
bucks you right out here

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:45.620
is very propel very propel i usually have this with me more often than my

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:48.460
number one choice because my number one choice is harder to find

02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:50.460
however

02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.740
there's a bottle of berry propel freakin sitting in rob's

02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:58.300
refrigerator because i bought it but i had to have my vanilla coke first

02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.580
all right so berry propel

02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:02.460
jamie's number two drink

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:09.460
lucky you're number two pick for best money beverage

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:12.740
early have anything other than my

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:13.660
number one

02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:20.660
so i have to go with imported mexican

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.540
what it makes him what

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:29.100
tequila

02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.200
Is that what the cayenne pepper to go with it and keep you from pooping?

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.000
Imported Mexican tap water!

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.800
By the way, a little note of fact for people who don't have the, you know, years of natural healing experience that I do.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.700
If you're going to go to Mexico and drink the water,

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:52.500
better eat cayenne pepper before you do, because it will keep you from shitting all over everything.

02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:52.900
Okay.

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.300
Oh, Jesus.

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.200
Alright, um, where are we?

02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.700
Dave, yes, you're number two choice.

02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:05.700
I'm not sure I can be imported next tap water, but my number two choice is vanilla coke icy.

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:11.700
Because those things are hella good, and they're really, really sweet, like twice as sweet as a normal vanilla coke.

02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:14.700
Vanilla coke icy, good choice, good choice.

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.700
Quack quack, be your number two pick, please.

02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:22.700
This one of mine is just like a recently discovered thing, I just tried it out once, it was like, oh, this is hella good.

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:30.700
It's made by Snapple. It's the Atomic Elements drink, which is the jack-apple flavor.

02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:37.700
It's got caffeine and ginseng and a bunch of other good shit that keeps me awake and hella hyper.

02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:41.700
And that's one of the things that I had last night that helped contribute to my 2D expansion.

02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.700
Very nice.

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:50.700
My number two pick? My number two pick was Red Bull and Malibu.

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:55.700
However, at the risk of sounding like a lush, I'm just going to cut that to Red Bull.

02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.700
That's the drink that looks like urine.

02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.700
Yes, the drink that smells like pussy.

02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.700
Or so I've heard.

02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:04.700
It actually does look like urine.

02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:06.700
Yeah, it does look like pee.

02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:09.700
But you know, my favorite bar has it now where it comes out of the spray.

02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:12.700
Like, they don't even have to open up the cans anymore. It's just right in the tap.

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:15.700
It's like Pepsi, Sprite, Red Bull. Fucking rules.

02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:21.300
Alright, so now we're down to our number one pick, Jamie, your number one best Bemani

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.300
beverage.

02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:26.500
Well, I have often said that one of these days I'm actually going to own one of the

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.420
vending machines for this beverage.

02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:32.820
I have ordered this stuff plenty of times and brought it in to our figgle to play and

02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.380
drink and stuff.

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:38.420
Pocari Sweat, the drink that actually does look like sweat, and it tastes much better

02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.940
than Gatorade.

02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:41.940
Pocari Sweat.

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:42.940
Yes.

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.940
Alright.

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.940
It's sweat-a-licious.

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.940
Pocari Sweat is kind of an intimidating name to me, I don't know.

02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:51.940
I don't know how I feel about Pocari Sweat.

02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:54.940
But anyway, let's move right along, shall we?

02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.940
Loki, your number one pick for best bemani beverage.

02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:01.940
I'm just going to go with Surge, because I love that stuff.

02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:02.940
It's good.

02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:04.940
Surge!

02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:08.940
Surge sounds like it should be with Slim Jim, I don't know.

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.940
Alright, so Surge, which they don't even make anymore, correct?

02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:16.940
I can't believe I was like, after I said vanilla coca ice, I completely forgot what I was going

02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:24.940
to say for this one, but I finally remembered. Hawaiian punch. Because they sell that down

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:30.940
at the shell for like 99 cents for a two liter, and I remember the days when it's raining,

02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:33.940
and everyone runs over there and buys like ten of them, and then you all just take them

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:36.940
back and put them in between the two DVR machines.

02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.940
just take them back and put them in between the two DVR machines.

02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:42.940
Would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?

02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:44.940
Punch.

02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:46.940
Don't punch!

02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:50.940
BlackWav, your number one choice, please, for Best Pay Money beverage.

02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:54.940
As the people in the room can see, I have a hat on.

02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:57.940
It has the logo splattered all over it.

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:00.940
And for those of you that aren't in the room and can't see it,

02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:03.940
it happens to be Mountain Dew Code Red.

02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:25.940
kostjamrh That shit tastes worse than Cherry Nyquil.

02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:27.940
Does not.

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.940
No!

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.940
Touch code red and die!

02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:35.940
Alright, my number one pick.

02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.940
Now, those of you who know, I know we have a lot of people from Vegas in the chatroom,

02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:45.940
so I know you guys will agree with me on this one, because this is the best Bimani drink I've ever had.

02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:47.940
I had the most fun playing Bimani.

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:48.940
Who's in Vegas?

02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:49.940
We have a few people from Vegas in the chatroom.

02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.940
Isn't like, Geos, Listen, Maple?

02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:52.940
Yes, I believe they're from Vegas.

02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:53.940
We have Maple also, right?

02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:54.940
No, Maple's in the bag.

02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:56.940
Oh, really? Okay, never mind.

02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:58.940
You don't know what you're talking about!

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:00.940
I believe VidPower is from Vegas.

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:02.940
We have some other folks there.

02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:04.940
Anyway, can I finish? Can I finish?

02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:05.940
No.

02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:08.940
So those of you in Vegas know about the Hilton.

02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:10.940
And the Hilton's got this little place called the Star Trek Experience.

02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:12.940
And at that experience, they sell a drink.

02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:13.940
Oh, you bitch.

02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:15.940
The Warp Core Breach, ladies and gentlemen.

02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:18.940
I fucking love the Warp Core Breach.

02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:22.940
I have done drunken DDR on the Warp Core Breach and it is the shit.

02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:33.940
Warp Core Breach, seven different kinds of Bacardi, Asobi, and Razzmatazz, all mixed together in a fish bowl, served with dry ice, and they won't serve it to just one person.

02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:35.940
Well, you can't order a one-person serving of it.

02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:38.940
Although, oh yeah, yes, they have it different now. You can order a one-person serving of it.

02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:45.940
Well, the DDR Freak Moderator's Trip, I have a friend that lives in Vegas, my friend Sierra.

02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:52.440
It was me and Iguana Girl and her boyfriend, Islander, and my friend, T'Nara, and her man.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:53.440
We all go to the Warp-

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440
We all go to the Warpcore Beach.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:58.940
We all go to the Star Trek Experience and proceed to go on the ride once.

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:02.940
Then have Warpcore Beach go on the ride again.

02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:07.940
That's exactly what I did at the 25th RockyCon, which was the first time I ever saw DDR, by the way.

02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:10.940
Well, my friends left, and it was just me and Iguana Girl and Islander,

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:16.940
and we all decided that we were going to go over to Circus Circus and play DDR there.

02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:23.940
That's exactly what I ended up doing. I believe I threw up the Romulan chicken strips later that night.

02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:27.940
It was a tribute to that first time on DDR.

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:34.940
And half the tab was broken, and it was just like the...

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:36.940
Drunken DDR is cool.

02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:37.940
Drunken DDR rules.

02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:49.940
So now here we do. We have a list. I was not expecting the list to look this diverse, that's for sure.

02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:56.940
A few notable exceptions. According to our chat room, we have made a few notable exceptions, including...

02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:58.940
Water?

02:07:58.940 --> 02:08:00.940
I said oxygenated water.

02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:02.940
Pepsi Blue is the big thing right now.

02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:08.140
thing right now. That stuff is shit. It tastes like someone ate strawberries and puked them.

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:14.180
I was thinking about that, but vanilla coke icees, like, so own that, because they do.

02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:19.060
That Pepsi Blue shit is nasty. Actually, I would have said Pepsi Blue because I don't

02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:23.900
actually like it, but it's really heavily- Yeah, but you also like to go red. Well, yeah.

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:28.620
I think it's really too heavily carbonated for me, and it makes me gassy. It makes you

02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:32.500
fart. I heard it makes you shit green, but I haven't really tested that. Anyway, nope,

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:33.500
nope alright

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:38.140
and then uh... also uh... pussy juice was another suggestion

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:40.900
i was actually thinking of saying that

02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.920
but then i was like no red fusion

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.180
a bunch of those new trendy drinks that's the new

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:50.980
all right so uh... you know a bunch of those new trendy drinks so they didn't make the list

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.340
so f you

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:57.380
water here's our list oxygenated water forty ounce malt liquor jolt strawberry

02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:00.140
snow bubble goldschlager berry propel

02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:02.220
imported mexican tap water

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:08.700
Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Red Bull, Pocari Sweat, Surge, Hawaiian Punch,

02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:12.100
Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:15.620
So we're going to start eliminating shit from this list right now.

02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:17.660
Jamie, what the fuck's coming off this list?

02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:19.140
The imported Mexican tap water.

02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:26.100
I would prefer not to play DDR and something like explosive diarrhea.

02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:27.540
Diarrhea diarrhea revolution.

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:31.540
So imported Mexican tap water is coming off the list.

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:33.540
We have a cry.

02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:35.540
Loki, what's coming off the list?

02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:42.540
I'm going to have to say goodbye to Red Bull because, yeah, it does look like pee.

02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:46.540
It smells like pee and probably is pee, but that's all right.

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.540
All right, so Red Bull's gone.

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.540
Fine.

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:53.540
But you know what? You've got to mix it with Malibu, but I didn't want to sound like a lush

02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:55.540
because I don't know if you realize, but all my other drinks are alcoholics.

02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.540
So anyway.

02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:59.540
Okay.

02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:01.540
Dave, what's coming off the list?

02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:06.540
Having not had most of these, such as the warp core breach, or something like that,

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:08.540
or, you know, gold schlocker.

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:09.540
You're just going to have to trust us.

02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:12.540
I think I'll take, yeah, I know.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:19.540
I think I'll take off the strawberry snow bubble because, what, I mean, it would seem,

02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.540
it would seem like it would be too heavy to play DDR afterwards if it was all milky.

02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.540
I know, but it just doesn't seem like the type of DDR drink.

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:32.540
I think they'll go have a strawberry snow bubble and go play Waka-Laka.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:35.540
I wouldn't have been able to do that in the first place because it's only a max one.

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:38.540
Strawberry snow bubbles off the list. All right.

02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:41.540
Black Lab, what's coming off this list of what's left here?

02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:44.540
Yeah. Let's see.

02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:48.540
As original as some of these are, hmm.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:52.540
I'd say the 40-ouncer has to go.

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:54.540
That's just a bit too much liquid to drink while you're playing.

02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:56.940
small lickers coming off

02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:59.780
he just made billy p cry

02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.660
how i would like to watch him cry

02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:07.620
i come home from a hard day of playing ddr i like to relax with a nice ice cold

02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:09.260
cold forty-five

02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:14.260
so oh another notable exception we left off the list balls

02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:15.860
ball

02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.740
let's give balls the honorable thing

02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:22.940
if balls got forgotten obviously none of us are drinking balls

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:23.820
and i think

02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:27.660
Maybe if we thought of it before we started eliminating drinks, then yes, but no, too

02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:30.000
late now, too late now.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.340
It gets an honorable mention, how's that?

02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:36.260
Falls gets an honorable mention.

02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:37.820
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:41.500
Yes, you have to repeat it.

02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:48.860
Black Lab said, I said I had never had Falls, and referring to the drink!

02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.660
Blue Balls on top of that.

02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:53.780
Anyway, can I finish, do I get to take my drink off now?

02:11:53.780 --> 02:12:02.780
My drink, this is an easy pick for me. I think this tough stuff tastes like turpentine, cat pee, I hate it. Bye bye, Serge. I hate Serge.

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.780
Dude, I fucking love Serge.

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:09.780
Dude, this is the first time that none of mine have been eliminated ever. I've been keeping track.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.780
Poor Matt is denied. You are denied.

02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:17.780
For those keeping score at home, all of Loki's picks got eliminated.

02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:19.780
And how does that make you feel?

02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:21.780
That's right.

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.780
Olive.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:24.780
God, Surge tastes like shit.

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:26.780
How come we're not even that light?

02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:27.780
Okay, important.

02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:31.780
Okay, you don't like Surge that you can drink that pesky blue shit?

02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:32.780
Yes.

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:33.780
For the record, yes.

02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.780
For Lamb's Blood, but you know, I didn't add that on there.

02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:40.780
Lamb's Blood? You're a sick bastard.

02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.780
How about, like, cow brain mucus?

02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.780
Alright.

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:50.780
Yeah, uh, you guys are weird. You guys are so weird.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:54.780
I wish it was the time that we were at Brookfield and, uh, uh,

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:58.780
uh, sheep have ordered, uh, what was it, a, uh,

02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:02.780
a monkey's brain, or something? I don't remember, I don't think that was it.

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:06.780
That was great. No, but he ordered it!

02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:10.780
I'm loading up a song here to play

02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:14.780
during the break here, so, um...

02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.900
Hi, so what I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to have Jamie read the list

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:22.540
and then I'll paste it in the chat room and you guys will have five minutes to vote.

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.940
So, Jamie, would you please, oh wait, let me post it in the chat room.

02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.700
You gotta send me your vote over private message in the chat room.

02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.380
Jamie, would you be so kind as to read this list off?

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.660
There, un-highlighted.

02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:37.580

02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:38.280

Bokari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:56.740
Alright, so there it is. Send me your votes over private message in the chat room. If they don't come over private message, they don't count.

02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:01.740
In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break. I'm just trying to queue up some music for you guys.

02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:10.740
No, just to reiterate for you guys, what you vote for will not be taken off the list. We've already done that. That was all done in-house.

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:12.960
Were the celebrities, so we get to do that.

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:15.960
You guys are picking the winners, you guys are picking the top three.

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.280
So out of that list, you're just gonna send me your favorite.

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:27.680
And whatever gets the most votes, you know, wins first place, and whatever gets second

02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:28.680
most votes gets second place.

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.640
So you're voting for your very favorite out of that list.

02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:36.000
In the meantime, here's a song that is often requested on the station ever since we played

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.060
it on one of Jamie's –

02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:53.780
Let's play some Tetris motherfucker.

02:15:37.060 --> 02:16:03.180
Can't you feel it?

02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:13.180
Can you feel it?

02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:23.180
Can you feel it?

02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:39.180
Can you feel it, feel it, can you feel it, feel it

02:16:39.180 --> 02:17:01.180

02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:59.180
Oh, come on, y'all, let's get it goin'

02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:03.180

02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:03.080
Beymani drink, and this was the final list, what, Dave?

02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:06.180
I just beat us in the disc on 2DX 7.

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:08.720
Wow yeah that's my fifth 7 star.

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:10.620
All the girls want to have sex with you now.

02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:13.300
Oh yeah! How many of them are even listening?

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:16.640
I don't know how many girls are listening, I don't get that kind of breakdown.

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:17.300
Twin.

02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:18.520
Anyway.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.540
We're kidding.

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:22.440
Oh.

02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.520
Newt. Newt. Newt. Anyway.

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:26.340
I just gave him a compliment.

02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.280
This is the list.

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.900
Oxygenated water, jolt, goldschlager, berry propel, vanilla coke, icy,

02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:36.660
Snapple Atomic Elements, Fakari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core

02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:37.660
Breach.

02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:38.660
And now...

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:39.660
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:40.660
What?

02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:42.700
I just have to say, if like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date

02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:43.700
him.

02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:44.700
Anyway!

02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:45.700
She's in the lesbian drive.

02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:46.700
Anyway!

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:47.700
What does that have to do with the money?

02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:48.940
That is not cool.

02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:49.940
Not cool.

02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:51.940
Spray personal information out on the radio.

02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:52.940
Nope.

02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:53.940
Not cool.

02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:55.300
Oh yeah, after you're talking about your whole hooker experience.

02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:56.300
Hey!

02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:57.300
Hey!

02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:58.300
Hey, that is me sharing, okay?

02:23:58.300 --> 02:23:59.860
That's not me sharing about someone else.

02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:00.860
What?

02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:01.860
Oh.

02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:08.860
if the hooker was listening to the radio show. I didn't mean anything about it.

02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:12.500
Can we read the list now or should we just throw the list away?

02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:19.500
No, but I haven't read the top three. The climax of this whole segment. Surely you guys

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:24.740
wouldn't let me get through a segment without climaxing. No guy would.

02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:28.740
Shirley Temple. Okay, go.

02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:43.080
The number three best bemoni drink is Hawaiian Punch.

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:55.960
The number two best bemoni drink is Vanilla Coke Icy.

02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:02.520
The number one best Bemani drink of all time is...

02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:06.920
Pecari Sweat.

02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:08.480
Jamie is a winner.

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:14.800
This is the second one I've gotten the first place on.

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:20.400
Alright so there you go, that is the list.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.280
That's it, I know we still got a half hour of show left.

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.960
We don't end at 9 anymore, we end at 9.30.

02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:25.920
yes low-key what

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:28.320
not plenty to fill a half an hour right

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:28.980
this is

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:29.880

02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:05.640

yeah it's on so it's just you know go check out the rules because there's

02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.200
plenty of them

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:13.820
he needed if they're really being strict about what they're doing this time so do

02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:15.800
you check that out

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.580
also there's another target going on it

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:21.340
i'm not even sure it is

02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:27.340
I don't know, it's some other sim tournament that I really wasn't paying attention to.

02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:30.340
Yeah, it's out there too, so I'm sure someone will...

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:35.340
Oh yes, and Make Edit Get Porn, that is still going on, so don't forget about that one.

02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:38.340
One thing I forgot to ask about the Make Edit Get Porn contest is,

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:41.340
does everybody who enters get porn, or just the winners?

02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:42.340
Just the winners.

02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:43.340
Alright, just making sure.

02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:45.340
I was going to say, that's a lot of porn for you to be sending out.

02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:46.340
Oh, I could do it, but...

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:47.340
Alright.

02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.340
So just the winners, just the top three.

02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.340
Just the winners will get porn, so...

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:55.700
gets a little porn, second place gets... Nope, just first place. Oh, the first place

02:26:55.700 --> 02:27:00.620
versus going to get all the porn? Yeah. That's a lot of porn. We'll see. We'll see how much

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:04.840
porn I can acquire from... And we're going to have an honorary... You have to specify

02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.580
if you want girl porn or boy porn, because there is going to be a boy porn prize. Okay,

02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:11.480
well, not by me, but yeah, we'll figure something out. We'll find something. Orange Lounge will

02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:18.620
donate a boy porn prize. Okay. But anyways, yeah, Max Beats is the other one. That's the

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:21.560
other contest going on there and it's like five categories enter there no

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:27.320
prizes for that but yeah it's fun so go check that one out too and see other

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:34.280
than that there's been some updates DWI finally decided to well update their

02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:39.140
stuff so now they're trying to play catch up there I guess playing catch up

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:45.440
anyways they added the extra extra stage support for that which no stepping is

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:52.440
They're still a good mile behind Stepmania.

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:58.440
There are no updates on Stepmania, but it's pretty good so far, so just check it out.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:06.440
Other than that, DDRUK is putting together a lot of full full sets of files to download.

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.440
They have full sets of Disney's Rave.

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:16.440
Well, I have to say that it's not completely full, they're missing some of the double steps, but, I mean, for the most part...

02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:18.440
Yeah, it's just if you're being anal-retentive.

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:29.440
Yes. For the most part, it's complete. They also have full sets of Euromix 1 and 2, all synced, and they have Clubmix, the club of pens on there.

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:34.440
You're starting a fight here in the chatroom, StepMania versus DWI.

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.440
Oh, I don't care.

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:39.440
Let them fight! Let them kill each other!

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:48.440
Anyway, go check that out, and I know for a fact, because I kind of helped, that there will be a DD, um, Ohasta.

02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.440
Ohasta rules. If we take another break before the end of the show, we'll play some Ohasta tracks.

02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:59.440
They're going to be releasing a pack for that pretty soon, so...

02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:02.440
I never did figure out the card thing in Ohasta.

02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:17.440
Have you ever done any of the Tokimeki songs?

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:19.440
Yep, all of them.

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:24.440
Okay, I still haven't figured out how to get to that point because I have Tokimeki 2.

02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:28.440
Yeah, I have all of them. I'm sure they'll be releasing a pack for that too.

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:35.440
I'm actually considering entering tourneymix3, by the way. I have to ask you if my song's been used before, though, but I'll ask you off-air. The one I want to do.

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:43.440
Well, I've already... yeah. See, this is what I've been doing today, is deciding which song I want to do. I've narrowed it down to a couple options.

02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:45.440
I already know, but I have a feeling it's been done.

02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:50.440
Okay, number one was Things of Mannery, and that was by Tack.

02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:52.440
You'll instantly get my vote.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:59.440
It's a six minute long song, I just cut it down to just over two minutes, two and a half minutes, so I have that one.

02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:05.440
I have an 80's track that's being remixed, which is so far in the lead in my picks.

02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:11.440
It's Amanda, originally by Boston, and it's covered by Brooklyn Queens. It's a Ford's Transmix.

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:15.440
It's a really catchy song, so maybe we can play that later.

02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:17.440
Oh, I've heard of this album.

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:18.440
So, it's pretty sweet.

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:21.440
This is like another 80's trans- I'm gonna need to copy this before you leave, okay?

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:22.440
Yeah, okay.

02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:24.440
It's got Journey on it, cool!

02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:25.440
Yeah.

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.440
But it's not really Journey.

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:27.440
It's like an update.

02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.440
I bought an album just like this the other- that's so crazy.

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.440
Cool.

02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:32.440
What album did you get?

02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:33.440
I got one, it's called Time After Time.

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:34.440
Damn it!

02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:35.440
That's the one I've been looking for!

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:36.440
I got that one.

02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:37.440
I need to get a copy of that.

02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:38.440
Okay.

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:39.440
Alright.

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:40.440
Okay.

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:53.440
Back on the subject here, also a random Beatmania track. I was looking at Hyperband or Alien World. I think that's by Ping Pong. It's from Beatmania the final, I think.

02:30:53.440 --> 02:31:06.440
But I was deciding between one of those, but it's probably going to be Amanda, because it's just a catchy song. I don't think I've recognized the original, but it's just a catchy song, and it'll be fine.

02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:09.440
So now you're gonna get five people doing that because they all heard you were gonna do it.

02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:10.440
They're all gonna copy you.

02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:12.440
That's fine, whatever, I don't care.

02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:15.440
But yeah, has that ever happened in those contests where two people end up doing the same song?

02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:19.440
Yeah, um, there was one with, um, um, Mr. Larpus, I think.

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:22.440
Um, that was Tranny Mix 1, they did that.

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:23.440
Don't!

02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:24.440
And, uh...

02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:25.440
They both end up losing, huh?

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:26.440
Yep.

02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:30.440
Because they cancel each other's votes out, so that's why I gotta make sure my song hasn't been done before.

02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:32.440
Yeah, so I'm doing that one, and, uh...

02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:43.440
And uh, it'll be pretty cool. I mean, I'm sure there'll be someone probably doing Sakura and someone probably doing Xenon, which those have been done. I mean, Sakura has 4,000 of them out there, so no one's gonna vote for that.

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:55.440
And I'm sure bmoni ruler sneak one out. There's only one song that he has, um, that was being released in the last set of release ones that he didn't quite get out, and that was The Return.

02:31:55.440 --> 02:32:00.680
My guess, if he was to enter and be lazy and not actually make a new file, it'd be he'd

02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:02.120
release the return.

02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:05.720
Which I heard is a really good trance track, but it's seven minutes long, so that's probably

02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:07.240
not going to happen.

02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:10.840
But you know, maybe, who knows.

02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:11.840
Really I don't care.

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:12.840
We shall see.

02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:13.840
I don't really care.

02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:18.000
He bitches too much about making sim files, and you know, so then he enters-

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.840
Didn't you already rant on this one week?

02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:22.840
I think you did, because I was going through archives today making that new intro.

02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.720
Yes, you did.

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:27.720
Maybe. Numerous times, no.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:33.720
But yeah, also my site, of course gotta plug it again, leechfromloki.tk.

02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:41.720
Gonna be getting to a point where I'm gonna try to upload every single BeatMania song I have made right now by other people.

02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:44.720
I just got a few more the other day. I got Happy Wedding from...

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:47.720
Happy Do, Happy Do, Happy Do.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:49.720
No, that's a different song. Okay.

02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:50.720
I thought that was Happy Wedding.

02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:56.720
Happy Wedding is the one that's like the rap over the piano music type thing, I don't remember.

02:32:56.720 --> 02:32:58.720
Oh, maybe it's the long version, I'm thinking of it.

02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:00.720
I don't know, whatever, anyways.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:07.720
Happy Wedding, and I know there's a few other ones I got files for, so I'll be trying to upload.

02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:13.720
I've got to reformat my whole pages to organize them in style groups and that type of thing,

02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:18.720
so I can actually start uploading them easier that way, but that's a lot of work.

02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:25.160
come see that next week. Maybe I'll try to upload something tonight. That's it. Oh, oh!

02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:32.220
And releases, as far as home releases, Dancing Stage Party Edition finally came out. Only

02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:38.500
problem is it has a huge freaking bug in it, which won't make it play on PS1s or Playstations,

02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:43.500
so that kind of sucks. It only plays on PS2s for some reason, even though it's a PS1 game.

02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:48.300
Whoops! Oopsie! You know, so that's not gonna... I want a copy of that, because I want to dance

02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:50.380
to uh... kylee minnow

02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:54.940
jim i had walked eight you know what i'm sure that i had

02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:55.900
land

02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:56.560
land

02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:00.020
and i was really like um... people there there are in

02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:03.200
now you can't wait and amar and that that's of the prior

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.180
so you price is out there

02:34:05.180 --> 02:34:06.780
i want to crack the field

02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:08.460
but i think that's a

02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:11.820
they'll be not in the same and but i think that was just a very serious

02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:18.820
Tranpower can definitely vouch for the fact that the sim is safe after Shaft, yes.

02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:23.820
That's all the sim news right now, just keep looking, there's more stuff going on everywhere.

02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:31.820
I was looking online today to see if there was any new news with that Feed a Fury, the Dreamcast game we talked about a couple weeks ago, and no, there's not. I was kind of disappointed.

02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:05.060
I'll bring them next week I believe we you know what I think we did that one

02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:09.220
episode you weren't here we went through it and we talked about Gameboy DDR music

02:35:09.220 --> 02:35:17.780
yes I've never been to 2d x-mities ah 2d x-mities that would be a fun show wow

02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:22.900
so what else going on DDR baumannii world right now anything shaft is over

02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:31.780
shaft is over I know some big news and that's coming up what yes okay well

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:37.020
So we've got Southern Hills Golf Land is closing, that was one big news item that came out this

02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:42.540
week, Shiggle, one of the big golf lands, of course, popular guy, Shiggle Boss over

02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:49.060
on some of the message boards, and that place is closing.

02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:52.500
Apparently what's happened is the city council has rezoned that area to be some residential

02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:57.220
housing, so Shiggle's going to be closing down, and who knows where those games will

02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:59.860
be going, probably to the Camelot Golf Land nearby.

02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:06.860
I was just going to mention that if anyone looked at their calendar this week, they would notice that the 20th falls on a Wednesday next week.

02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:10.860
And so 20 November, obviously you're going to have a bunch of new stuff going on in the DDR Spot.

02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:14.860
Big Bahmani thing. I happen to know there's one major website relaunching on 20 November.

02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:16.860
Yes, the number one...

02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:18.860
You'll know the spot to go to.

02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:24.860
Yes, ddrspot.com is relaunching starting on the 20th, so check that out.

02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:28.860
I know SoCalKicks' site just relaunched on the 15th.

02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.860
Actually, he had to cancel it. That was the big news. He had to cancel that.

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:35.860
And he has a new tagline, by the way. I'll show this to you guys now.

02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:37.860
Because remember last week we were talking about the SoCalKicks tagline.

02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:43.860
And we love SoCalKicks because he did the Orange Lounge website, so we forever owe him sexual favors.

02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:45.860
No, you do.

02:36:45.860 --> 02:36:47.860
No, not just me. But see, now he has a new tagline.

02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:50.860
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just later.

02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:53.860
Instead of just now, it'll be just later.

02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:55.860
That's funny.

02:36:55.860 --> 02:37:00.860
That kind of sucks for him. We'll hope that he can get his website back up soon.

02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:05.860
I know, but my style is going to be doing something and same with 2dxstyle.com.

02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:07.860
Oh, they're going to be doing some special shit.

02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:08.860
So check those out on Wednesday.

02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:12.860
And maybe OrangeLount Radio will do a special 20 November fuck off.

02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:16.860
Oh, and you know what someone else is probably doing?

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:24.860
Or I should say a certain somebody with a certain journal will be probably talking about 20 November as well since that does come out that day too.

02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:27.860
What about the 19th of November?

02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:28.860
Yeah.

02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:31.860
And everybody's neglecting 19 November, which is by far a better song.

02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:35.860
Dear diary, today is 19 November.

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:39.860
Today is when I fap it furiously, because tomorrow Politary is coming to my house.

02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:42.860
And I'll put pictures of the internet in my journal.

02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:47.860
Speaking of journals, Jamie, you want to talk about the Orange Lounge Live Journal community that we have going now?

02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:52.860
Yes. I set this up last Sunday right after the show.

02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:56.380
If you go to livejournal.com

02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:59.620
slash users slash orange lounge

02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:04.120
that is our orange lounge community and if you wish to join it's open access however if

02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:05.900
you fuck it up we'll kick your ass out.

02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:09.540
And what kind of post will we expect to be seeing in the orange

02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:12.860
lounge live journal community? Random shit. Just like this show.

02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:15.880
Well basically you know those of us who have something to contribute to the show or the

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:16.820
big money community

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.980
or even things that have been slightly related like I posted deep thoughts in there

02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.660
because we did talk about it last week

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:27.840
Or just, you know, things about the show, you know, we announced the time changes, different

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:28.840
things.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.840
You know, go ahead and join up.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:34.920
And make sure, by the way, that you actually join the community instead of set it to watch.

02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:37.560
That way if you join the community, you can post to it.

02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:41.240
Also, everybody who is a member of the community is also on the friends list page.

02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:42.760
But again, don't fuck it up.

02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.760
Yeah, you fuck it up, your ass is out.

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:48.720
Yeah, but please post because I think there's about five or six posts right now.

02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:50.720
There's five, but there's plenty on the friends list.

02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:56.100
We don't want to flood it though, so join, you don't have to post every day, but when

02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:58.980
you have something orange loungy to say, post it.

02:38:58.980 --> 02:39:03.300
I hate to disappoint everybody, but I don't know if I'd update my live journal ever.

02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:04.660
Well now you have a reason to.

02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:09.940
No, because the only time I talk in the live journal is like, guess what, my sim has a

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.660
thousand songs now!

02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:14.780
Guess what, my sim has a thousand and five songs now!

02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:18.500
So it's just like...

02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:22.060
I have a question from the chat room, how exactly do I join the community?

02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:25.100
Well, all you have to do, go to the info page.

02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:29.340
When you go to the Orangetox community, there's an info page, and it'll say right at the top,

02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:34.420
oh yeah, user info, if you want to join this community, click here.

02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:38.780
And you want to list it as a friend, one of your friends.

02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:42.400
If you just list it as a friend, you're only going to be watching it, you haven't actually

02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:45.580
joined it.

02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:50.620
If you go to the profile and hit the click here link to join the community, it will give

02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:54.220
you the option to set it as part of your friends list automatically, so you don't have to click

02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:58.100
the separate button on the profile page.

02:39:58.100 --> 02:39:59.100
Thank you.

02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:00.660
And we have a link posted in the chat room.

02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:04.920
And another question, why can't we make it on U-Journal?

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:07.380
Because everything else is just a rip-off of Live Journal.

02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:09.900
Actually, Live Journal is open source.

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:13.580
Live Journal is open source, so everything else basically rips off it.

02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.580
If you really, really need a LiveJournal code, I've got a few extra, maybe...

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.580
I have a couple. If I think you don't suck, I'll give you one.

02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:25.580
Yeah, PM me on a forum you know I'm on, and MAYBE I'll give you a code.

02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:29.580
We'll see. MAYBE. MAYBE.

02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:33.580
Possibly. Okay, well, other news. Any more money?

02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:37.580
Um, no, but I was gonna say that if you ever catch me in the chat room,

02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:41.580
you can almost guarantee that I'll be throwing up random porn links every now and then.

02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:48.580
I've never seen you in there.

02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:50.660
Loki comes in at about midnight.

02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:52.460
Like seriously, it's a very late night.

02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:54.380
Look at this chat room statistics page.

02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:55.380
He is on there.

02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:57.460
Just very late at night.

02:40:57.460 --> 02:41:00.500
He's on there at the under 80 posts, I think.

02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:02.300
Yes, one of the low posters.

02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:04.020
He's like, fine, I'm going to post.

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:08.300
I think I've seen the channel like twice, okay?

02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:09.300
I've been in there.

02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:10.300
I was in there last night.

02:41:10.300 --> 02:41:12.300
He's in there more often than I am

02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.240
Yeah, well, I'm in there like more often than all y'all

02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:20.160
Remember that one time I did the whole like, you know, I'm making a sim file while I'm chatting thing? Remember?

02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:21.540
Yeah, that was what?

02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:25.840
A big thank you by the way to all our chatters in the chat room tonight. We've been had a record

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:28.940
We were pushing 20 people there at one point in the chat room. So thanks you guys

02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:29.800
You guys are cool

02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:31.800
Blowing shit up in our chat room

02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:33.800
I used to go in the chat room more often and so I got scared

02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.480
Yeah, I mean there's a lot of if you look at the stats a lot of people are starting to idle more throughout the day and just

02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:44.200
Talk at random points throughout the day. So that's what it is. So just come join our chat room

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.240
for a recent accomplishments that passed many double Oni's because

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.200
RVGL's

02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.460
Max to machine was on free play. So yeah. Yeah, it was on free play because

02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.760
Every Saturday morning they turn all the machines on free play and after they go around to each one by hand

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:05.980
So I guess they forgot happens and so I got to be lots of ones like template change and stuff. That's cool

02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:11.960
Well, we're going to take another really quick break and we're going to come back and we're

02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:16.680
going to wrap up the show with final thoughts and maybe another quick topic.

02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:17.680
Oh, yes.

02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:18.680
Look, before we break.

02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:19.680
Really quick last minute.

02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:21.680
It's kind of an F you that I forgot earlier.

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:22.680
Oh, boy.

02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:23.680
Don't worry.

02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:24.680
Okay.

02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:30.760
It's a big F you to RVGL's ticket counting machine because the damn thing sucks in the

02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:35.920
tickets and it's just all boop, boop, boop, like it'll suck in 20 tickets and count two.

02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:39.920
So because they're stupid and lazy and don't have to do it, that's why they do it.

02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.920
Alright, that's it.

02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:43.920
Alright. Thank you very much.

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.920
We're going to take a quick break. We're going to start it off, as promised, with some Ohasta DDR.

02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:53.920
An Ohasta DDR track, and then we're going to play...

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:55.920
What did you want, Jamie? You wanted Total Recall?

02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:57.920
Total Recall. From Beatmania Fiskmix.

02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:00.920
And then we will be back.

02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:07.920
So, we'll be back very soon.

02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:24.920
The early bird gets the worm!

02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:25.920
Yeah!

02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:27.920
I only stand so high for me

02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:30.920
So high, make me ready for me

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:32.920
Woo!

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:34.920
Woo!

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:38.920
Woo!

02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:40.920
Come on, get it!

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:41.920
Woo!

02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:43.920
Come on, get it!

02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:45.920
Make the beat pound

02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:47.920
Come on, get it!

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:49.920
Make the beat pound

02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.920
Come on, get it!

02:45:51.920 --> 02:46:08.920
Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! Amanda!

02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:33.920
Tomorrow's so far away, there's something I just have to say

02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:41.920
I don't think I can hide what I'm feeling inside another day

02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:44.920
Knowing I love you

02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:48.920
I hope you know I do

02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:54.920
And I'm getting too close again

02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:58.920
I don't wanna see it end

02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:01.920
If I tell you tonight

02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:03.920
Will you turn up the light

02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:05.920
And walk away

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.920
Knowing I love you

02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:38.920
Oh Amanda, I'm gonna kill you right away, I can't wait another day

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:20.920
And I feel like today's the day I'm lookin' for my words today

02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:27.920
Do you wanna be free? Are you ready for me to feel this way?

02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:35.920
I don't wanna lose you No, no, no, no, no

02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:40.920
Oh, you made me soon, I know

02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:45.920
Feelings take so long to grow

02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:49.920
If I tell you to take what you've done to me

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:52.920
And let me go

02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:56.920
I don't wanna lose you

02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:00.920
No, no, no, no, no, no

02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:07.920
I'm gonna take you on these crimes and make you realize I'm a man of love

02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.920
I'm gonna tell you right away I can't wait another day

02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:14.920
I'm a man of love

02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:21.920
I'm gonna say it like I can and make you understand I'm a man of love

02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:27.920
I'm fine but I love you

02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:34.880
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:36.680
us on all the fun together.

02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:40.520
But hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:43.960
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:46.480
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.320
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:56.120
Hey, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, season premiere, episode number 20, and Loki,

02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:59.120
Do you want to remind our chatroom what that last song was that we just heard?

02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:02.120
That last song was the song I'm doing for Turny Mix, probably.

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:05.120
But you're going to edit that down a little.

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:10.120
Well, I actually have an edited down version. I thought I burned it on the CD, but that's the CD I listened to in the car, so I guess not.

02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:17.120
That's Amanda, which was originally done by the 80's group Boston, and this new version is done by Brooklyn Queens.

02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:23.120
It's a Ford's Trance mix, and can be found on Vic Latino Presents 80's Now.

02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:26.680
CD that was on sale at Tower, so go check it out. It's pretty good, but I'd probably

02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:28.960
recommend Time After Time, which is the CD I was looking for.

02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:34.400
I don't know. It's okay. It's okay. I bought it. But it's okay.

02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:39.920
I was on 80 Music Kick after, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, so I just had

02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:41.440
to get some Remix City stuff.

02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.560
What is up with this Grand Theft Auto Vice City thing? I never played those games, so...

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:51.040
Okay. Dance Door was a fucking nightmare the day that game came out. It was full of all

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:55.840
stupid people but the CDs oh my god the CDs are awesome because they have you

02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:59.500
know and when you're playing GTA you can change the station and you have the the

02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:04.880
DJ come up and they say something funny well the DJ's are on the CDs introducing

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:10.000
some of the tracks the Latino one is absolutely hilarious yes and there's a

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:16.360
new wave one too which I like so so we're coming into the final home

02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:20.080
stretch of the show I thought maybe we go around and talk about our best

02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:26.280
Spumani moment of the week maybe our big yes of the week since shaft picked up

02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:31.360
like just in play 2d x like but but what'd you do I passed fantasy in like

02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:37.200
seven so there you go okay I'm you know I'm always slow on so on the big money

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:41.800
games I will admit it but I had been trying to beat fantasy on light seven

02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:46.680
forever it was one of two songs I had left to do on fourth style and I've been

02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:53.720
getting 76, 78, 76, 78. I beat it with a 90% today, so I'm happy. And I'm getting there

02:51:53.720 --> 02:52:00.480
on get on beat. And I almost beat voltage today.

02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:07.400
Very cool. Any Bahmani moments of the week you would like to share with us?

02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:13.360
I didn't really do anything other than download shit off the internet. That was Bahmani related.

02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:19.800
I downloaded more sim files to add something like 1588 now or something like that.

02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:25.960
But yeah, that's pretty much all I did, reorganize my sim stuff, updated some of my files with

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:28.960
full sets instead of just the partial shit I had.

02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:36.720
And that's about it, I mean, update my website, fix some links and shit, direct this guy who

02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:41.840
couldn't speak to find MP3s, so like I said.

02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:46.140
black lab yes

02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:49.460
besides the obvious part of me now being a bitch

02:52:49.460 --> 02:52:52.240
of 2dx6 style

02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:57.380
and 5th style and 4th style yes that's true and third style

02:52:57.380 --> 02:53:01.300
which didn't have celebrate I couldn't find celebrate maybe I just don't have it unlocked yet

02:53:01.300 --> 02:53:04.580
anyway anyways

02:53:04.580 --> 02:53:08.620
let's see other than that I haven't done shit

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:10.300
bmani wise

02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:14.920
haven't been to arcades, haven't been to tapioca express to play

02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:18.440
i really didn't play that much bmani when i went to

02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:20.160
went home over the weekend

02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:22.160
and yeah

02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:25.460
i'm deprived, help me please

02:53:25.460 --> 02:53:28.060
oh, jamie has another one she wants to share

02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:30.020
i full combo'd cowgirl

02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:32.180
rad

02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:35.140
gallops are one of my weakest things

02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:39.060
go over for Boba and you beat it then? No, this was right after Shaft. I was damn

02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:41.580
tired, exhausted, and hardly got to eat anything.

02:53:41.580 --> 02:53:44.440
So right before they were going to take the machine off of event mode,

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:48.420
I was like, fuck all of you, I'm going to play, okay? Dammit, I've been running

02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:49.420
back and forth

02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.260
just so that you people could have a good time,

02:53:51.260 --> 02:53:53.860
which I'm glad everyone did, and I was really happy.

02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:55.580
I'm going to play DDR, hell!

02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:58.140
So I played cowgirl, and I full combo'd it.

02:53:58.140 --> 02:54:02.700
While I was dead tired, and then I went home and took a Vicodin.

02:54:02.700 --> 02:54:04.400
You took some drugs!

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:29.400
I actually don't know why I came up with this anyway, so I don't have any of the money news to report. I barely played any at all. I played a little 2DX, I haven't passed shit, new, I'm still stuck at the same point I was. I keep fucking up like the last few measures of V, otherwise I could pass the goddamn song on 7 key. I haven't really passed anything else. I'm getting closer to DXY, that's about it.

02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:34.500
personally so I guess it's about it we got only a few minutes left in the show

02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:37.620
let's go around and get everybody's final worse Dave get Dave in here we

02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:44.820
have to get final thought so what did he

02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:53.820
okay so let's talk about everybody's final thought for today

02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:55.820
I'll go final.

02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:57.820
I'll go final.

02:54:57.820 --> 02:54:58.820
You'll go final.

02:54:58.820 --> 02:54:59.820
Loki, your final thought?

02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:05.820
Um, definitely be watching the Fries ads because they've been having a lot of good stuff really

02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:06.820
cheap lately.

02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:10.820
I mean, you can't beat, if I didn't want to stick with the name-brand Yamaha, you know,

02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:16.820
I could have gone with the verbatim CDR burner for $19, a 40-speed CD burner.

02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:17.820
Let's just put it this way.

02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:22.820
40 speed, I put my shoes on today while I was burning the CD, the CD burner finished

02:55:22.820 --> 02:55:29.260
burning my CD before my shoes were on. I mean, that's just crazy shit right there. So, definitely

02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:33.180
check that stuff out. Watch my site later this week. There should be some updates, I

02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:38.580
hope, if I get around to it. I've been kind of busy. And, yeah, that kind of shit. So,

02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:41.900
watch that. Look for Turny Mix because you're going to have a lot of cool files to download

02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:47.420
there and, yeah, just that kind of stuff. Have fun.

02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:50.000
Glad be a final thought for today.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.060
Let's me think.

02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:56.420
I have a paper due tomorrow morning that I need to finish when I get home.

02:55:56.420 --> 02:55:58.080
Slacker.

02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:00.060
Damn right I am.

02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:01.840
And uh... let's see.

02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:05.420
The next time Twinz says back suck, I'm going to go down to Florida and take one of those

02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:09.660
puck mice from the early IMAX and shove it up his ass.

02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:10.740
We don't want to go

02:56:10.740 --> 02:56:12.020
to that area.

02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:13.100
I don't want to know about

02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:16.420
things going up Twinz's ass.

02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:19.100
Hey, I mean, uh, I don't know.

02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:20.100
Mac?

02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:21.100
Rob!

02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:24.100
I'm not done with my final thought yet, dammit.

02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:25.100
You dammit.

02:56:25.100 --> 02:56:26.100
Um.

02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:27.100
Dammit?

02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:29.660
You maybe forgot what I was gonna say.

02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:30.660
Wrong text.

02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:31.660
Yeah.

02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:32.660
Uh.

02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:33.660
Whatever.

02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.220
Yeah, I had fun tonight.

02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:37.220
Yee, go me.

02:56:37.220 --> 02:56:38.220
No.

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:39.220
No, Loki.

02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:42.220
You're done.

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:43.220
I let him talk.

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:44.220
Loki.

02:56:44.220 --> 02:56:54.220
Expect some more Guitar Freak's 7th and 8th music and also popping music stuff to be appearing in our playlists later this week. Check it out.

02:56:54.220 --> 02:57:06.220
We actually already have some 8th and 7th in there, but Popping Music, per that email, we ordered our albums and we got them. Wink wink. So we'll be adding the popping music stuff like we promised we would this week.

02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:10.220
And um, the Paula Tamberry's, uh, the Paula Terry ban is over now, so...

02:57:10.220 --> 02:57:11.220
No, no it's not!

02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:13.220
Oh, we're gonna ban her for another week?

02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:15.220
We'll ban her for a month.

02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:16.220
We'll ban her till next year.

02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:19.220
Alright, so uh, Paula Terry's banned for the rest of the year.

02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:27.220
Um, and uh, my final thought is, uh, I still need a date, but it looks like I might have one this week, so that's cool.

02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:29.220
Oooooooh!

02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:30.220
And um, shut up.

02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:35.220
And uh, I guess that's it, I need to go play DDR because I'm getting fat.

02:57:35.220 --> 02:57:37.220
I don't like being fat.

02:57:38.220 --> 02:57:39.220
That's it.

02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:41.220
Jamie, your final thought?

02:57:42.220 --> 02:57:43.220
That's it.

02:57:43.220 --> 02:57:45.220
That's it, that's your final thought?

02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:49.220
I guess Dave doesn't have final thought. Dave loses.

02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:49.220
Dave doesn't have a single thought in his head.

02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:53.220
Dave doesn't have a thought in his head.

02:57:56.220 --> 02:57:58.220
Dave's final thought, oh yeah Dave pressed one.

02:57:58.220 --> 02:58:00.220

02:58:00.220 --> 02:58:01.600

yeah we're training

02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:48.520
i was very disappointed there's no gilligan's island music in the intro

02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:52.720
do to do to do i thought about it but that's so cliche i i promoted it is the

02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:54.940
three hour tour so i was about it

02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:57.880
what you think of three hours

02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:02.780
at the hell of a lot better when you're actually in here

02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:05.500
and even though it's kind of a small room it's a hell of a lot better

02:59:05.500 --> 02:59:07.260
it's sitting down on my computer

02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:09.060
and my ass getting numb

02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:11.220
from not moving

02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:12.400
but yeah otherwise that's cool

02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:15.480
it would have been better if we had a lot more bimani news going on but

02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:18.100
since everyone was kind of like nope

02:59:18.100 --> 02:59:21.100
maybe we'll get out and do some interviews this week so I'll have something to talk about next week

02:59:21.100 --> 02:59:29.780
I am very scared of the best of tape that you're going to put together here, but...

02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:30.780
Coming soon.

02:59:30.780 --> 02:59:31.780
Coming soon.

02:59:31.780 --> 02:59:32.780
Do your worst.

02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:35.980
And next week we need three microphones, just thought I'd mention that.

02:59:35.980 --> 02:59:38.140
We'll see what we can do.

02:59:38.140 --> 02:59:40.420
And another chair.

02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:41.420
We'll see what we can do.

02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:42.420
Oh, and the phone.

02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:43.420
The magic phone box, too.

02:59:43.420 --> 02:59:44.420
We can't do that.

02:59:44.420 --> 02:59:46.420
We'll see what we can do.

02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:47.420
All right.

02:59:47.420 --> 02:59:48.420
Thanks for listening, everybody.
