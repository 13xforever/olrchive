Message for you, son!
Attention!
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Mamani Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?
That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
What's your favorite scary?
Showgirls.
Absolute fright.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gang?
No one expects a punishing position.
It's gender.
Hey!
DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio, and this is episode number 22 for December the 1st of 2002 at
I have a nut.
DarkSakura.com
Also tonight with us in studio, say hello to Brad, Yankee style.
You're not to taste good.
Okay, I'm going to go play animal.
And the happy little panda rice princess, say hello to Irene.
Hi, I'm going to go play animal.
Addicts.
You're all addicts.
We'll be talking to them more.
We're going to do listless tonight, so they'll be back for listless a little later in the show.
First, we're going to take a really quick break, feature you some requests.
So we can eat more nuts.
And we're going to eat more nuts, and we'll be right back to talk about all things Bomani.
And then some.
See you then.
Thanks for watching!
That's a boring story.
I don't have a girlfriend right now.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you!
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello, we are back live.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Dave's in the house.
What's up?
He's color coordinated.
What's up?
Yeah, I wear blue now.
That's all I wear.
You're so coordinated today.
Happy Hanukkah to you, Dave.
Yeah, I got Max USA.
Dave, by the way, is also our resident Jew.
Congratulations.
You've got to love the Jewish people, though.
I've never met a mean Jewish person.
Every Jewish person I've ever met has been completely nice.
Dave, kind of borderline, but good enough.
My grandmother.
No, I do like this color coordination thing you have going on.
Very nice.
You know, we were just playing that promo, the catch-up song promo, and I was thinking, Dave's the only person I know that actually knows the dance.
And I wish I'd known the other night when they were playing it at the club.
I don't know the dance.
I saw the five-second video of them doing, like, the, I don't know, the chimichanga dance or whatever it's called.
The cucaracha dance.
Yeah, that.
That's where you lay on your back and wave your hands and the feet in the air like a dead cockroach.
The cucaracha.
No, but the reason why I'm late is because... Are we just being totally random tonight?
Why are you tardy, sir?
Well, I figured you're just getting used to the 6.30 thing, because this is only, like, what, the third show we've been starting at 6.30?
Actually, I remembered at about 4 o'clock, I'm like, okay, well, I just borrowed Kingdom Hearts from my friend JJ, so I think I'll go play the Hades Cup now, which is 50 battles long, including at least five bosses.
So I started that, I'm not exactly sure when, because I had to level up a little bit,
And then I finally finished, I beat everyone, and I finished like 10 minutes ago.
And then I ran down and came over here.
Well, I suppose if we're going to get cast aside for Kingdom Hearts, there's not a lot we can do.
Animal Crossing stole me from Kingdom Hearts.
That's right.
Animal Crossing, by the way, is in the other room right now, and that's where Brad and Irene, they just came in in the beginning to say hello, and now they're back out there.
They'll be back for listless later on the show, but... I'm going to have to start playing Kingdom Hearts again because I'm only at Agrabah.
And I'm way over-leveled for where I am.
Being suggested in the chat room, apparently EOSFEB has this bookmarked, the link to the catch-up song video.
Because he sure was able to find that pretty fast.
So he wants us to watch that live on air, but unfortunately I can't do that.
I don't want to vomit on the microphone.
Yeah, we don't want to get Jamie to vomit on the microphone.
Also, if I try to watch streaming video, it eats up a lot of my resources, which means listeners get kicked from the live stream, and we don't want that to happen.
But we'll do that another time.
He says he wants to thank whoever made that video, so I'm assuming there's a lot of cleavage and boob shots.
Cleavage.
Anyway.
Yeah, let's hear it for tits.
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
As I say it, I'm a flat monotone.
Okay, we apologize also if you're hearing a hum in the background tonight.
We don't know what's causing it.
We're trying in studio here to take measures to not have it happen, but it's still happening, we think, so just bear with us tonight, please.
Yes.
Just pretend we're all doing yoga.
It's the incessant noise of Homer after he's like, Mmm, donut.
Beer.
72-ounce tub of beer.
You know, they sell these huge, huge, big old things at 7-Eleven now.
There's like, gotta be like 114 ounces.
The buckets.
The super buckets.
You didn't see the bucket that I bought Dan at Great America.
What's that?
We were there to see Margaret Cho.
I bought this 100 and something ounce bucket.
Drink bucket.
For Dan.
Oh, I do remember seeing that.
Yes, it was for his coffee.
No, just for him to drink.
For orange soda.
You know, the 7-Eleven's having a special right now.
You can fill up any mug for 79 cents full of coffee.
Dude, I'll do that.
I'll bring that thing and fill it up full of coffee and take it to work.
You should make your ghetto mochas.
I did my ghetto mocha's own.
The ghetto mocha...
You take really strong coffee, and then you put in Swiss Mist chocolate mix.
Add in a tablespoon of hazelnut creamer, and then like half a spoonful of sugar.
Mix that up, add more coffee to mix everything else up, and then drink it.
You'll be awake all day for the next week.
Oh, you're going to go get sucked in Animal Crossing 2 as well.
I've heard so much about it, how can I resist?
Right.
fine, fine you didn't even eat my nuts
Oh, now Bradley's here.
Dang, is there a party going on at the house today that I don't know about, apparently?
Alright, let's say hello to Bradley.
How you doing, Bradley?
I'm doing okay.
You just ran over here.
You were in the chat room, the exit, and now here you are.
Now, you came to finally get your 2DX controller this week, right?
Yes.
Unless I forget again.
I'll come back again.
I swear I haven't played it at all.
Well, obviously, we have Animal Crossing now, so we got sucked into that.
So, there's no use for my PlayStation anymore, because, you know, we've got Animal Crossing.
Screw Bomani, this is now a show all about Animal Crossing.
Oh my god, that Mallory.
It's the I hate Mallory show.
I like Mallory.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Mallory gives me stuff.
Well, you hear that Olivia is the troublemaker in our town, who moved from your town.
I don't want Olivia back.
You're abusing Olivia.
Anyway, I do have to say also though, of course, a big, big thank you to Loki.
Thanks for watching!
But Loki spent a little money to get a GameCube and an Animal Crossing for the house.
We deeply appreciate it, so thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Alright, cool.
Let's start the show off tonight by visiting the old mailbag.
If you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And so right now we're going to open up the mailbag and take a look.
Because we've got some mail this week.
We...
Let's see, going into the mailbag.
OrangeLawnTrailYahoo.com Oh, look!
One new message!
Hey, that's one more email than we had last week.
Yes, and I feel so special.
Alright.
Happy Crack!
Also known as Propel.
Propel?
You're on Propel.
Loki, what are you on?
I'm not on anything.
I just like this.
I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm high on life.
I prefer Happy Crack.
I'm on God.
No, I'm just kidding.
Okay, not that there's anything wrong with that.
If all goes well later, I'll be on a stranger's bed.
No, uh, just kidding, just kidding.
That's going to be enough boy porn.
Question number two, Martin wants to know, no, it's all about man porn.
I'm not a boy, I'm a man.
Alright, question number two for Martin, can he have some?
Sure, go to Walgreens.
Go Walgreens and get some Propel.
All right.
As we discussed, I'm not on anything, so to have... No.
You can't.
You can't have any of me.
I'm too good for you.
Too good for you.
And unfortunately, you can't have any of my life.
You can probably get some man porn if you go down to your local video store.
Rob, are you running out of time?
Do you need a time transplant?
Yes.
I need to go back to high school.
I missed out on so much.
Okay, you know what?
Martin, if you send us your address...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You'd almost think we're a real radio station or something.
Yeah, give us your address, we'll send you flavored water.
Next!
Alright, we didn't say what it was going to be, flavored ass.
Mmm, pea-flavored propel, yuck.
Mmm, urination, the best nation in the world.
You're disgusting.
Alright, question number three.
Why does the chat room not work on my fucking computer?
Send us your fucking computer stats.
Let me guess, you're using a Mac.
Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing.
You must be using a Mac.
I know it's a little difficult, and you might get confused with a toaster.
Now, here's how you can tell.
Can you put toast in it?
Does it make bagels?
If it does those two things, that's kind of difficult.
You might need to actually get a computer expert to determine whether it's a toaster or a Mac.
So, good luck there.
I only said that to piss off Black Lab, because I know he's listening right now.
We love you, Black Lab.
Love you, Black Lab.
Okay.
Black Lab, by the way, is a big Mac fan, so we occasionally knock on the Macs to piss him off.
And if actually Shark's girl's listening, she's a Mac whore, too.
She's a Mac-ette.
The best thing I can suggest is use the Java chat room.
All you have to do is go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and then you're going to just click on the chat page.
And then at the very bottom it'll say, if all these steps don't work, try our Java applet.
And I have to give thanks to Twen because he helped us get this Java applet working.
This handy little thing.
And that should work.
If your computer can view complex websites, you can run Java.
You can get into chat through that method.
So good luck.
And we hope to see you in the chat room tonight.
Question number four from Martin.
We're going through the email in our email bag at OrangeLionRadioYahoo.com right now.
Question number four is, how the hell did you know so much about the money?
Well, I'm glad you asked because this is the part where we get to inflate our egos a little bit talking about how old school we are, Jamie.
Gee, don't start on me or anything.
Do you want to go new schoolist to old schoolist?
Well, I can start.
Alright, Jamie's the most old school in the room.
Alright, um, let's see.
Not last year, year before.
I first played on the DDR machine at AX2000, I think it was.
Bradley was there, that's where I met Bradley.
On the May Expo 2000.
Yeah, I started playing in February of that year.
Actually, I had seen DDR the year before that.
I was in a Best of Move tournament, Best of Move 2, just trashing everybody until I got a faulty controller.
So it was in...
July of 1999 that I first saw DDR and I looked over and thought, that game looks stupid.
Until I heard someone playing, um, uh, what was that bus stop song?
Kung Fu Fighting.
And I was like, hey, it's Kung Fu Fighting, that's pretty cool.
And then I went over and looked at it and I'm like, oh.
And then I played DDR for the first time in February and my friend loaned me his PlayStation version and a dance pad.
Really crappy, they were probably one too, but I digress.
Um,
So, I was like, this DDR thing is cool, and then I came home from work one day in April, my birthday, and there was our Dreamcast set out with one of the nice dance pads and my own DDR second mix.
So I was happy, and I first played the machine, and, uh...
I remember being in there, seeing Xanadu, because I liked the movie, and I liked Olivia Newton-John.
And people would go, I thought you'd never played DDR before?
But, I like, this was a movie?
Hello, you know, Olivia Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra, are you that young?
So...
And that's how it went from there.
September-ish.
No, maybe August or so.
Because Euclid Lane's got their DDR 1.5 and that started it.
Right on.
So, and just you've become such an addict over time that that's how you know so much about my money.
Yeah, I just kept finding more and more stuff that I liked.
Sounds good.
My story, I'll try to keep it brief.
Well, there's one other thing.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I have this, you know, addiction to owning controllers.
So...
Ooh, we need my money again, I have to have a good controller for it!
And, yeah, anyway, okay, go ahead.
I don't remember, but it was Memorial Day some year.
I went and I actually went to Milpitas Golf Land.
And I think they were having a tournament because there were a lot of people there.
Now keep in mind, I knew nothing about, we were actually going there to golf.
I knew nothing about DDR or anything.
I saw the game, thought it was cool.
No chance in hell I was going to be playing because there was way too crowded around the machine.
But I actually ended up seeing the machine months later at a 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention in October of 2000, and that's when I played for the first time.
And a couple friends from the Rocky cast, including Rice Princess, was out in the other room.
We skipped out on the convention Friday night, and we stayed up and played DDR, and it was so much fun.
So that's when I got hooked on DDR.
and after that, let's see, I started playing when Roseville Golfland got USA Mix in something like, what, January?
I don't know.
So I started playing, no, it was December, December of two years ago.
I met you at Milpitas Golfland.
Yeah, so it's coming up, yeah, it's coming up two years.
So two years I've been playing Mamani and I just, what can I say, I'm addicted.
And I just, I'm a sponge.
I pick up every piece of information I hear online.
As far as the radio thing goes, I used to have my own college radio show for seven semesters back when I went to Chico State, so that's kind of where I picked up the radio thing.
And then I was co-hosting a program called Understation Live up until a couple months ago when our head host, Travis, had to leave, took off for Texas, and just kind of been doing the radio thing ever since.
Orange Lounge is, I guess at its core, Orange Lounge is somewhat of a spin-off of that show, but...
I don't know.
I don't know what you want to call it.
Loki, your turn.
You're the most new school, and this is kind of sad, because I know you've been playing DDR at least a year, so that doesn't make you that new school.
It's actually been like two years.
Oh, wow.
It started, I think it was, let's see.
I saw you there.
I knew I saw you in front of me.
I was dressed up as Emmy.
How would I remember?
I don't know.
He was drunk.
He was trying to get hookers.
I've been trying to get hookers.
Anyway.
Well, if you tuned into last week or the week before that, you would have already known that that's happened.
I mean, sorta.
No, he was chasing the Jiggly slut around.
Jiggly slut?
The Jigglypuff cosplay girl.
No, they...
No, I remember, well, no, last year, last year we were chasing around a bunch of women with cameras, but, uh, no.
Anyways, so I saw a DDR4th mix there, and then I got to try a USA Machine in Tahoe and had no rhythm whatsoever, so that was fun.
And, um, so then I went and
I guess I found out that it was at, you know, Sunsplash, or RPGL, and so I went and played down there, you know, ever since the other fourth in their USA machine.
I, you know, bought the home versions and that kind of thing.
And then ever since that, because I used to be really into Cusar, and, you know, the laser tech place up here, and I played it for like four years and was really obsessed with it.
Well, then that went away, and so now...
Now I guess I'm just new in the DDR, and how I know a lot of stuff about Bomani is that at my work, during phone calls and stuff, I'm actually browsing the Bomani news sites out there, and that's how I know pretty much everything that goes on, because I read about, I'd say about 12 different message boards all day long.
Right on, so that's the answer to that question.
Boy, that was a long question, that was a long answer, but hey, we've got a lot to say here on Orange Lounge Radio.
If you're just joining us, as I know some people have just joined us, we are answering email right now.
If you have a question, a comment, something you'd like to say, we will read it in our mailbag segment.
Just send us an email, orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.
And we're reading an email from Martin right now, and he asked a bunch of questions, so we're answering them right now.
Question number five, is it only me or do the Zippers suck?
The Zippers, by the way, being that band that JB brought in last night, or I'm sorry, last week with the CD.
I'm not a huge fan of the Zippers.
In fact, I don't like them pretty much at all.
But, yeah, they kind of suck if you don't like that speed type music thing.
I don't know, that's kind of a trend that DDR has, you know, putting a lot of speed mixes and Euro mixes, stuff, stuff.
If you're just not into it, I guess then you wouldn't like it, but, you know, it's something for someone, I'm sure.
Like JV.
They definitely need to flush that song
So, your opinion of the zippers, Jamie?
Our apologies to JB, and we hope you still love us.
Alright, Waka Laka School.
Next question.
How come everyone I know suddenly has the weasel, a.k.a.
Bush Baby?
Bush Baby...
Our second Orange Lounge mascot.
Our first Orange Lounge mascot would be Dave.
But our second Orange Lounge mascot would be the weasel.
It was given to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.
Simple as that.
And it sits here.
I have a lot of little thingies that sit above the computer.
There's a Clifford ball.
There's a devil I got from that same convention where I saw DDR the first time.
A couple Bats Maru.
A bunch of stickers.
Cartman doll.
Things like that.
The ferret was just sitting up there and Jamie grabbed it one night and just went to town.
So you hear it right now.
So, that's the story behind the weasel.
And if everyone you know has the weasel, I don't know your friends, so I don't know why.
Is the weasel a ferret?
It's a thingy.
Next question.
How did you find out about DDR top hits or mishits?
I signed on to Sackbay Money one day and there it was.
The end.
Loki told me, so I'll let him tell him.
It was actually Aaron in Japan.
They were on their message boards.
They were doing a kind of like Demonte knockoffs and spinoffs and that kind of thing.
And that happened to be the first one they were talking about was DJR Top Hits.
Same group did another one.
They did a solo upgrade to Fifth Mix.
So it's the same people that did that one, did this one.
So yeah, AaronInJapan.com.
Very fine website.
We like them.
So go visit them.
Next question, did I get your email address right?
Well, of course you did, because we're reading your email right now.
It is OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word, at Yahoo.com, and says, Loki, email me back if you did.
So I'll forward this email to Loki, and you two can talk about whatever you guys need to talk about.
I don't know.
Oh, maybe he wants a date.
We'll see.
All right, so thanks so much for the email, Marvin.
We appreciate it.
And I think he just joined the chat room.
I see a new name here that matches the one on the email, so who knows?
Oh, we just got one more new message.
Let's have a look.
Oh, we got an email from Black Lab.
Oh, it's his FUs of the week.
Well, we've got to save those for later.
Never mind.
We'll read those later.
Those are the FUs of the week.
I was going to try to make it out there, but I don't know how possible it is with my work.
Yeah, it's a little ways to go.
Oh, he says, he says, yes, it is him.
And also, another early happy birthday wish to one of our, we have a new school listener and a very, very old school listener.
Been here with us, I believe, since the first show.
Did our website.
SoCal Kicks is having a birthday tomorrow.
So, happy birthday to him.
Squeak.
Oh, I can turn off the music now.
We're done with the mailbag.
So, a big happy birthday.
Yeah, because I have the sound off in the studio to try to get rid of that hum.
I don't know.
We'll see.
So, speaking of SoCalKicks, I believe I can talk about this now.
I don't know.
We're going to see.
I'm going to plug some websites.
We're going to do some website hunting right now because a couple of websites have just launched.
Crikey!
There's one right now.
A couple new Bimani websites have launched, and we're going to check them out right here, live on air.
First one, SoCalKicks.com did launch 5.0, I believe it is.
Oh, and this is the one where we were making fun of his tagline a couple weeks ago, because he has this tagline that says, SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now, but now it's just later, or just now, just this second.
Okay, um, Rob.
Yes, Dave.
I just got back from the other room.
Dude, that game looks so boring.
I don't know if there's some underlying secret mind control device, but it's like, okay.
Yes.
You talking about Animal Crossing?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's addicting as hell.
It's like, okay, I think I'll go change the music now.
Did they show you the old school Nintendo games that you can play?
No.
Tell them to go to my house and play the old school Nintendo games.
It's awesome.
Okay, I will.
Jameel, want to comment on Animal Crossing?
No, I was just saying yes.
Oh, okay.
Oh, yes, back to SoCalKicks.com.
Blah, blah, blah.
Welcome back to STK Max Ultimate Evolution just now.
About time after a three-week wait and constant launch dates being flushed right down the drain.
Finally, the site relaunches.
Just in time for SoCalKicks' birthday.
Aw.
Happy birthday.
He's got a lot of people on board.
Going to be doing the website stuff and none of us are on it.
Thank you for watching!
Let's see, so what's so big about STK Max 5.0 that makes it better than the other versions?
It says, well many things actually.
For the first time, they have forums.
They're going to have some forums.
Pretty nice.
Or I can read.
And let's see, and they're going to be talking about all Bomani and it's not just going to be whoring out Konami of America stuff.
It's going to be all DDR, so that'll be cool.
and let's see, they're going to do pad reviews, mod facts, blah blah blah, check it out for yourself, SoCalKicks.com.
Let's see, let's see what these forums look like, I'm very curious.
More forums.
Oh, it's the generic layout for the forums, well that's okay.
He says they're going to update that soon, so.
Ooh, I should register now, huh?
So I can get in there and register right now, so I'll be like one of the first few members.
Let's see, blah blah blah, I'm going to register for this new board.
You do that.
I'm going to go get a taco.
You're going to go get a taco?
Alright, we're going to peruse another website.
We're going to peruse another website while I sign up for those forums.
and Benso.
See ya.
Thank you for watching
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demends It
It's just that simple.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yes, I'm going to see, I'm going to the Cher concert.
You get to see Miss Porcelain.
See what I'm really wanting to go see though?
Cyndi Lauper's opening and she's just fucking fabulous so I can't wait to go.
So, we will be taped next week.
But if you want to hear it live, we'll be doing the normal shtick just on Saturday night as opposed to Sunday.
So, outside of that, oh yes, we're going to be also doing a mini marathon next week.
So if you want to catch up on some old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to be marathoning all of Season 1 next weekend.
All of it.
So tune in for that.
Actually, this is something that you and I have discussed, and I forgot to mention it.
Yes, that's fine.
I told you before about a friend of mine who's doing a radio drama.
Yes, talk about this.
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
One is actually based on I Feel Sick, which was Debbie's spinoff.
and I'm going to be a voice actor in it.
I'm going to be Oblivia.
And we still need one more voice actor for this.
My friend Michelle is very talented doing a very good adaptation of the comic, so we need one more voice actor.
So if anyone's interested, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.
I'm interested.
Can you sound like a whiny gothy boy?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.com
Brand new, I'm not sure if this is going to be a blog or what it is.
I believe it's a blog, but I'm being asked to hoard out by a chat regular of ours, DCB.
He's a good buddy of the show.
He's going to be doing a tournament in Fremont, a DDR tourney in Fremont in January.
Check the DDR Freak Tournament forums if you want more information on that.
A Fremont tournament in January.
And he's got this website called Killer Pals.
Super Friends
www.radbeats.com
It's orange and blue
Lissy, do they have a forum?
No, the forum link doesn't work.
How about links?
We have not been added to the links page yet.
Grr, hang thy head in shame.
That's alright, we'll forgive them this once.
And the members page doesn't work.
So obviously this page is under construction, but it's something you should keep an eye on.
It's pretty.
Because they're neat.
I only know about half these people, but they're all neat.
The half I do know are neat.
They're very well taken care of and clean.
They have good hygiene.
So visit the killer pals, because Bongo demands it.
Yeah.
Let's see.
Oh, 23rd Magus has a comment for you, Jamie.
He says he could sound like a whiny goth boy, because he is.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Do samples of your voice, try to sound, you know, do different types of voices and say different things and email me that.
Meet me later on AIM and I'll get that from you.
Now they're having an argument in the chat room about tilde versus tilde.
Squiggly thing.
Squiggly thing, exactly.
Just go to dictionary.com and look up the word.
All hail the squiggly thing.
And we'll have a pronunciation key there so you don't have to actually go into a dictionary or feel it.
Okay, so that's our website tour for the week.
I don't know, is there any other website news that you know of?
Things going on?
Loki, any big websites that have been renovated?
Mergers?
Buyouts?
Sellouts?
Other than the couple week old 2DX style going down, I guess they're doing more to the Monty style to kind of incorporate the junk that they were covering with 2DXstyle.com on there.
So that will probably be going on.
There's another site that's coming up at some point, DDRextreme.com, and there's going to be some stuff on there.
They already have the little page saying coming soon, that kind of thing.
Aside from that, oh, Dance Dance Evolution's down now for good.
Let me make one quick interruption.
Michelle, I see you, and yes I did whore out the show.
We are going to have that last voice actor.
LeechTrumLokiTK will soon be hosting
Some Sky Original Step Mania files They will be scary indeed, so keep an eye out for them I've gotten into the sim I also have to mention that I did change my Tourney Mix 3 song And you'll be hearing that later on in the show Yes, we'll be doing that in the cage match later Cage match is coming up I'm so glad we have a crowded chat room tonight That makes me a happy bunny Oh, hello Elena Oh yes, I wanted to get to this You have to go soon, huh?
Oh well, I wanted to talk to Elena Everybody say hello to Elena Hello
D.D.R.
and I was still a nerd back then though too, right?
What I want to talk to you about is, because I like to bring strangers on the show occasionally that know nothing about DDR, just ask you, what do you think when you see this for the first time, this DDR fanatic fan club?
Are we crazy, or what is it?
No, frankly, you scare me.
We scare you?
How do we scare you?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just all the dancing and all the weird things you guys do.
All the weird things?
Like what?
Hand plants and bar raping?
Yeah, and you know what?
You know what?
I see some of the stuff that you guys, the dance moves and stuff.
It's kind of weird.
It's kind of different.
It's weird in a good way, I should say.
Now, but what I did want to talk to Elena about is that she just discovered the world of PlayStation 2, what, two weeks ago?
How did this happen?
Actually, my roommate's boyfriend, Mike, brought over a PlayStation, and this is really a big upgrade for us over at my roommate's and my house.
We have the original Atari, and we have been playing it, actually.
Word.
The original.
We play Space Invaders and all the fun stuff.
I wanted to ask you about Atari 2600.
Because you've been playing Atari 2600 up until two weeks ago.
It was all about fucking Atari.
It was great.
What is the best Atari 2600 game you've ever played in your whole life?
Space Invaders.
Space Invaders?
I love it.
I disagree.
I disagree.
Breakout.
That's because you're a bastard.
No, no.
Kaboom.
Kaboom.
Kaboom is the best.
Kangaroo.
No, I didn't like Kangaroo at all.
But you know what?
I have a 5200 and it's all about kicks.
See, we can't even get that game.
It's all about a large group of drunk people playing combat.
No.
Okay, I'm being yelled at in the chat room because Atari 2600 is not the original Atari.
It's the only Atari that matters, so shove it.
There was the Pong system, and there was some other one that was like a maze one.
Yeah, but this is... Yeah, but as far as conventional systems go, the Atari 2600 is probably the granddaddy, unless you count the Fairchild Channel F that came out before it.
You don't even play Game Boy?
No, actually, I haven't ever played Game Boy.
You haven't ever played Game Boy.
So, you just don't think you can get into the DDR?
Did you see the turntable game, the 2DX, the turntable game with the buttons?
No.
No.
Is it just intimidating?
What frightens you about DDR?
Oh, I see, you don't got no time for DDR.
Busy Elena, she got time to be doing the Space Invaders.
But heaven forbid you ask her to dance a little.
Now, Space Invaders is an awfully good drunk party game.
Well, so is DDR.
You've been to the house parties, you know.
I can play 2DX drunk and do pretty good.
But you know what?
It's not only just DDR that is a little strange.
I came to a party that you were at.
Yes.
You guys were playing...
Yes, Parapara.
Oh, Parapara scares even us, so it's okay.
Oh, we got Ryan to wear Ina's clothing.
That was great.
We got one of our friends, Ryan, SDMX, he actually wore his girlfriend's clothes to play Parapara.
Pictures were taken of this and put on other websites, yes.
That's insane.
That was an insane party.
Did we get you to play that?
How is Parapara frightening to you?
I wasn't drunk.
How is Parapara frightening?
I want to know.
Well, first of all, it's not in English.
Actually, most of the songs are in English and all the text in the game is too.
Not the one that you guys had on that night.
The Macarena's in Spanish.
Everybody knows the Macarena.
Yes, gutter.
Well, the scary thing I think about Pot of Potta is that when you watch the people who know the dances, and then you have five people behind them who all know the dances too.
Was that going on when you were here?
That we were all going, boom, boom, deluxe, da, da, da, da, da, da, shake my ass, shake my ass.
It was a whole room of people.
It was very, very... I can totally understand.
At the MGL Tournament 2, I think it was, when they were having that go on, people around the Parapara second mix, I was just walking the room and all of a sudden you see 30 people doing it.
Holy crap!
Zombies!
Run!
It's still all over again!
You know the sad thing about it in Japan and Hawaii and basically all over the area?
The pata pata dance, there's whole clubs of people who do this.
And everybody dresses the same because, you know, it's easier to do pata pata when you have no sleeves and everything.
Wait a minute, because knowing Elena, I know something about Elena that y'all don't know, so I'm coming in armed.
Elena, don't you do country line dancing?
Oh, no, not since there hasn't been a club in Sacramento.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
How is country line dancing different than para-para, except the music in para-para is better?
Well, you know what, I never country line dance without some alcohol in me, so no.
The other thing about pata-pata is just...
Say hello to Neil.
That's because with country line dancing, you're not doing it alone.
Yes.
You're not looking like a single fool.
And you don't have idiot shadowing behind you.
At actual pata pata clubs, they have everybody doing the same thing with you.
So everybody looks like they're all in a pack.
So if I took you to a para para club, do you think you'd get down and boogie?
You know what, I probably could handle the dances.
I don't think.
No offense, you know, I love you.
That was the best thing I've heard all night.
That's so owned.
You get winner points today.
Alaina gets escorted off the show now.
Thank you for being with us tonight.
We appreciate it.
Big hugs.
Take care.
Enjoy Gran Turismo.
This is your new addiction, Gran Turismo.
It's on top, man.
227.9.
What car are you using?
are something.
You know what?
We're going to take you to play Initial D someday.
Yes, we must take you to play Initial D. You will love Initial D. This is the only game I have played on these new PlayStations.
I have to learn one before I move on to the next.
You're going to graduate to Initial D next week.
And then maybe some Grand Theft Auto after that.
We'll see.
Alright.
Take care, Elena.
Big hand for Elena.
Yay.
I still need to get Vice City.
And Neil was in there too.
I still need to get Vice City so that I can go around and kill people.
You can get hookers to sleep with you.
I don't want a hooker.
See, the thing is, they don't have, you know, like, man sluts out on the street in that game.
They need to have man sluts.
There needs to be... Okay, you know, they just put out Tokimeki Memorial Girlside, where you can, you know, date the boys.
I want to have GTA Chick version, where you can go pick up the man sluts off the streets.
and go on this female crusade, you know, beating wife beaters and everything and setting houses on fire.
And, like, watching Oprah.
You can, like, have the militant female mission and everything.
Ooh, I'm hungry.
Ooh, here's some bonbons on the ground.
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.
Oh, shit, I gotta get the car over to Mervin's.
They're having a sale.
Open, open, open, open.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not like that.
I'm just kidding.
Thanks for watching!
I think we're going to take a really quick break.
In the chat room to Sky, that's me, and they'll have your FUs of the week.
So send those now, and we'll read those on the air when we come back.
Let us know what has you really hacked off.
Or, if you're too lazy, you don't want to join our chat room, you want a little bit of anonymity, that's fine.
You can send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
And if you say, don't say my name on the air, we won't.
So you can do your anonymous FUs.
Fair enough.
You can be a win.
Jamie, would you like to dedicate this first song during the break?
I dedicate this song to me because I love it.
Alright, here we go.
I'm lost inside of me Trapped in emotion Where am I going to?
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
Hey, it's our buddy Mel B there, saying hello to all of us and all of you listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We've got to have him back on the show sometime.
He can pull off that tone very well.
Yes, he's very smooth.
Yeah, he's very smooth.
Yes.
Okay, so as promised, it's time to talk about the FUs of the week.
We can be pissy.
Jamie, why don't you give us a little background on the FUs of the week.
This is 22 weeks running now.
No longer than that, about 24 weeks.
It started with our very first show.
Yes.
Because I was feeling particularly angsty one day and wanted to just vent, vent, vent, vent.
Well, guess what?
You all get to hear it.
Well, anyway, the whole thing with having the FU's of the week is basically it is our time to vent.
These are the things that aggravate us.
We're people.
We're human.
We need to get this out of our system or we'll go crazy and we'll take you with us.
Anyway.
So that's what the FUs of the week are for, and eventually the chatroom got as angsty as we did, so we let them in on the fun too.
And you still can sit in on the fun.
If you want to send us your FUs of the week, you just send those over a private message and we'll take care of it.
See, even the stupid ferret has an FU of the week.
See?
Are you ready to begin with your FU of the week, Jamie?
Please do.
Let's kick it off.
Because this is fucked up.
Alright.
My FU of the week, I have a few, as usual.
Um, you know, the last few weeks have been a little bit happier, haven't had so much to bitch about.
I would like to say fuck you to Ragnarok Online.
This is why, okay?
I've been sitting there for three months waiting for the server to come back up so that I could get my character back in my lovely little goggles and be happy, and they're making us pay for it.
Well, that in and of itself is fine.
You know, $10 for two months.
That's not that bad, except the thing is that they haven't been letting people in with the server.
Well, thank God I didn't pay, because I don't want them to have my credit card number.
So, fuck them.
I'll play the Japanese one, which is opening up tomorrow.
And, my next fucking week goes for, um...
Well, you know, it goes for the fact that I don't have anyone to play Phantasy Star Online with.
I'm trying.
I'll be there soon.
We need people.
If anybody has Phantasy Star Online and managed to get their hands on a GameCube, you know, broadband adapter, stay with me, please.
I don't want to play PSO by myself.
Stay with me.
Would you like to play a game?
Um...
and other fucking salutes go toward my really awesome fans, my ones with a fire on them.
They're tearing up already, and I've had the shoes barely for months.
I love those shoes.
I've got those shoes full, and they're tearing up, so piss me off.
Okay, um, in the next episode... This is one of the stupid people I have to drive to work with.
Oh my god.
Sacramento's full of the most stupid fucking people in the world because they can't drive.
SoCalKicks would like to share that he asked for Phantasy Star Online for his birthday.
Good luck getting the broadband adapter.
Okay, get this.
Nintendo puts out the broadband adapter for the GameCube.
And Nintendo.
And then recalls the thing.
I don't know if it was recalled or just if they stopped, you know, making them, but why put out a big multiplayer game and then stop making the adapter?
That's just retarded.
Well, anyway, I've got mine because, you know, my fiancé being the manager of GameStop, he can pull those little strings and things like that.
But, um, in the meantime, you know, I'm gaming by myself.
And also, if I go to Animal Crossing, because I really want to start playing Kingdom Hearts again.
Every time I play Kingdom Hearts, that wave bird just stares at me.
You want to check on your village.
You want to check on your village.
You want to go by the looking way.
You still have $300,000 to pay off on your own.
Alright, let's hear from Loki, Refuse of the Week.
First, if he has to go to eBay...
because, um, for a few reasons, actually.
One, this annoying new ad campaign that they have going where it's like Broadway singers singing like stupid crap about eBay.
I really don't want to hear about eBay.
eBay's stupid, with all these people that bid last minute on stuff.
I was winning the two bids on my, you know, hair-to-hair crap and my places too, and I definitely won.
And, yeah, like, one second left, you know, people bid up, you know, on it going over the price of it.
However, I got one of the fucking bastards back because he bid up on, what was it, my PlayStation 2?
So I bid up another $30 on it just to piss him off.
That was cool.
Amen.
And so you ended up paying like a good $40 over of what they were both worth, so that's a good thing.
Okay, you can have them.
So that's that.
And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just hate eBay because it sucks.
They don't have anything good on there.
And, you know, I found, you know, a few caramels.
And, uh, oh.
I'll tell you what, my plan is to have an outlet store where they don't need your machines.
If you want a machine to try out your little project on, I will volunteer mine.
The Holidays.
And it's not because, you know, I'm like a Scrooge or, you know, I hate that kind of thing.
I just hate, you know, I hate the whole, like, constantly playing Christmas music.
I mean, they have, like, four songs that they just play over and over.
It's really annoying.
I hate, you know, these stupid Christmas sales and people dressed up like, you know, they're cold or something.
I hate this shit.
It's annoying.
People are so stupid around the holidays.
And...
Thanks for watching!
I mean, I'm sure back in tradition, you had candles up on the Christmas tree, but I don't think it ever wanted to progress to the point where, I have a giant plastic snowman in my front lawn!
Yay!
There's the houses that are tastefully done, with a few white lights here and there, but then there's the houses that Christmas throws up on.
Yeah, but not when you live in Ghettoville.
Ghettoville doesn't have those tastefully done houses.
They have, oh look, there's a giant American flag going across the whole court.
Ooh, fun!
And then we're just going to randomly throw up lights on our house.
Yeah, I don't know.
I hate that part of Christmas and holidays.
I hate the commercialization of holidays.
It sucks.
I don't really have anything sweet.
I've been kind of tired, so... I would like to escape on this little holiday special.
Go for it.
Okay, everybody knows that I am very tolerant toward other religions and people's beliefs, but I really hate being preached to at Christmas time, okay?
I hate when people come to me, you're gonna go to hell if you don't believe this.
It's Christmas.
Those damn people and their Kwanzaa.
Okay.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Celebrate what you want.
All these Christmas pageants and everything, and they have it snowing and crap.
First of all, if you want to go historically, the time that they would have, you know, and this is coming from knowing lots of theologians and everything, if you want to go historically, when Jesus was born, okay, they were doing a census.
Is it census or census?
The plural of census, okay.
Anyway, a census would have been done coming up into the spring season.
So therefore, they first of all got Susan wrong.
The reason why Christmas is in the wintertime is because of the pagan holiday!
Hello?
Yule?
You know?
Go get it.
You know the whole Christmas tree?
It's pagan!
Jesus did not have a Christmas tree at his manger.
Okay?
How do you know?
Were you there?
Did you see it?
Okay, Douglas firs did not grow in Arabia.
Oh yeah, sure.
Not under this mystical, like, you know, birthing happening here.
No, they just couldn't magically make a Douglas fir appear out of nowhere.
Sure, and like, you know, bushes catch on fire every day.
Okay, come on.
What about Santa Claus?
Dammit.
Hey.
You little Santa people.
Just listen here.
I did have to say, Santa Claus saved the day in my movie, Feeders 2.
He kicked the ass against those aliens, you know, and Santa Claus is really, you know, awesome when he has a ray gun.
Remember in Nightmare Before Christmas, Sandy Claus.
Well, how can I follow up these?
I don't know.
I need to start doing my FUs first, because...
DarkSakura.com
and then He-Man, of course.
Anyway, oh yes, my FUs of the week.
My first FU of the week would be the Christmas carols as well.
I was in Taco Bell the other night listening to Christmas carols.
Oh my god, I'm going to be so nauseatingly sick of Deck the Fucking Halls by the time 25th World's Around.
Just you wait, just you wait.
I hate Christmas carols.
My second FU of the week would be to work because I don't want to go back.
I've enjoyed this little vacation too much.
I don't want to go either.
and my third FU of the week goes to Olivia at Animal Crossing because she's bipolar.
I need to kill Olivia back in my village.
That's rough for taking Olivia away from me.
And I guess that's it.
Let's talk about the chatroom FUs, shall we?
I don't get FUs.
I have more.
You have more?
Seriously?
Alright.
Let's talk to the chatroom about their FUs.
We love you, chatroom.
Yes, we do.
We do love the chatroom.
You're special.
Alright.
Oh, fuck you for doing Deck the Halls.
Deck the Halls.
All right, yes, Loki.
There's an FU going out to, I can't remember the guy's name.
I think it was, I don't remember.
Anyway, someone just released a remix of Let Them Move as a sim file, and it reminded me of one of Twen's things.
Actually, he said, and I quote, this one's actually worse than the ones I did.
So that gets you an idea of how bad this thing is.
Back to Twins FUs.
FU to half the chat rooms for not ever taking a joke.
Okay, whatever.
That was funny, ha ha ha.
He's got some happy FUs.
Who doesn't want to hear happy FUs?
No.
Take your happy FUs and cram them.
Dude, he's at Pensacola.
I was like from like near there.
Really?
Yeah.
Right on.
His girlfriend is from Pensacola.
That's like an hour from where I used to live.
Oh, and he's going to miss Orange Lounge to go spend time with a woman.
Hey, hey, if you get a benefit from missing the show, you need to spend that time.
If you're going to miss this show for some pussy, then I suppose, you know, we can forgive you.
Alright, uh, let's see, moving right along.
That's a showgirls moment.
Stresa says, um, F you to the three days that he's played DDR, he's not that bad at all, and he can do almost any direction on the damn pad, do pretty well, I can pull off light freestyle for four foot, five foot, so I can do pretty darn good.
He's not a noob, and F anyone who says he's a noobie.
Nope.
Just kidding, you're not new.
Everybody's got to start somewhere.
We all got to start somewhere.
DSCS SoCalKick says, FU to PHP Conflictions.
He really doesn't have any FUs other than that.
So, he's a happy camper outside of that.
EOSFBB says Dear Lord, there's a lot.
Okay.
F you to people who attended Comdex in Vegas.
You whores made traffic a nightmare.
And F you to all the exhibitors especially because it went for the free stuff and he left disappointed.
Comdex sucks.
F you to whoever thought of Thanksgiving.
Now I got a fridge full of leftovers and I'm already sick of turkey.
It's all about the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving because pizza is still good the next day.
Amen.
Time for the plugs, since everybody else got a plug.
Mostly websites, but while in Vegas, be sure to visit VidPower's restaurant, Cheerful Chinese Cuisine, in sunny Las Vegas.
Open six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, at 1223 East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.
Call for takeout.
Oh, shit.
Wait, we don't want the address broadcast.
I just read it.
My bad.
You'll get business.
You need to say it first, then I won't say it.
I just read in order.
I read from top to bottom, top to bottom.
I think I'm done with his FUs now.
Let's go to next FUs.
The next set of FUs comes from 23rd Magus.
I have a big FU to Chatroom Drama because it's there.
A medium-sized FU to Matsuri Japan Maniac for throwing off my groove.
And a bite-sized FU, I like that, a bite-sized FU to Battle.net for screwing up every time he connects.
And also a fuck me to any available ladies.
Whoa, hello.
Whoa!
Whoa, this isn't hot or not.
Whoa!
That's right.
No selling meat here on Orange Lounge.
And one last FU to the Skrull system.
I need no explanation.
I want all their balls to die.
I think we need shirts.
I think we need shirts that say that.
I want all your balls to die.
Should we ask the person who made that shockwave thing?
Is there a shockwave?
I didn't realize there was a shockwave.
Oh, my bad.
It's a really bad version of the Romeo and Juliette.
But there's an even better one, though, that was Harry Potter.
With the Draco dance.
Anyway, VidPower says, FU of the week goes to germs, once again, because my voice is all harsh and scraggly, and whenever I cough, my body feels like crap.
And FU to stupid, mean bowling attendants.
I agree.
Yeah, fuck them.
Fuck them.
Brack2000 says, FU to Nori Nori Nori, and that one's for 23 Megas.
He's doing an FU on behalf of somebody else.
Yes.
DDR Angel says, Hello, I made our window disappear.
Here it is again.
F you to stomp to my beat, because it hates Stresa and I, and it won't let us pass it.
That F you was from Stresa and DDR Angel.
Well, keep working at it.
What can we say?
If you're playing the Maniac, the fourth plus steps are pretty hard, too, from what I remember.
So, I don't remember which version's on Max USA, but keep working at it.
That's the best advice we can give you.
Always just keep playing, practice, practice, practice, and you'll get it eventually.
Good luck.
DDRholic says, it isn't so much an FU, but just a question.
Where have you guys been on Wednesdays?
Do you guys go to RVGL on another day or have you just been busy?
Oh, but she does want to second Loki's FU to the commercialism of the holidays, especially the competition.
Who freaking cares who has the most expensive decorations?
Amen, sister.
Just for a second there, guys.
We keep reading your name.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm saying D-D-Arcoholic, but that's a different person.
D-D-Arcoholic.
Like an alcoholic.
Okay.
My bad.
This is why I'm not in real radio.
D-D-Arcoholic.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and probably on Thursday actually, not Wednesday.
So we'll see.
It's a little bit easier to get there on Thursday.
A little bit easier for us to get there on Thursday.
Sometimes it may transfer the time to Scandia because we love Scandia so much more.
But you know what?
Diddy, Alcoholic, dear, send me an email.
Send the show an email, orangelawnsradio at yahoo.com and we'll plan a day to hook up and meet because we like you.
And I can give up a Wednesday.
I can give up a Wednesday one week to come meet you.
We can do that.
Sure.
Do you have something to say?
Bradley.
Yes, no, maybe so?
Yeah, sure.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, do I have music?
No.
I can get you some music.
Hold on.
I'm going to get you some happy guitar freaky music here if I can find some.
Yeah, I'm going to give you something new.
You want Kachaka?
Let's do Kachaka.
Kachaka, Kachaka.
Oh, well.
Who cares?
Neither does Cowgirl, but hey.
I'll take fuck you to secondhand smoke.
Because I really, really, really hate cigarette smoke.
It's one of my most hated smells in the entire world.
and especially a bad because like in one of the local arcade or the jail guitar freaks and drum manias kind of close to the front door so often I smell the smoke from the parents who I smoke with a few packs of 10 and kill my lungs for a while
and also fuck you to the cigarette smoke that's closest to my door at some mysterious location.
I don't feel any air ducts from the cracks in the windows or something.
It's just noise and a lot of stuff.
And for this week, fuck you to myself for being a thoughtless bastard and never calling my parents.
and our Asian relatives for Thanksgiving.
That's right.
Thanksgiving is a commercial holiday.
It's Butterball independent.
Don't worry about it.
Sorry I have to talk to you, but I'm coming over to save your room.
I did that to my family.
I'm getting a recommendation.
I need to check the email box because we don't want to miss any FUs.
So going back.
Here we go.
Yes, we've got a couple.
Damn, we've got a few.
Okay, so here we go.
First off from Black Lab.
Fuck that zebra that tried to bite my damn fingers off on Friday, stupid zebras.
Fuck my whiny ass brother for bitching about every single thing I've done this weekend.
Fuck space heaters that don't work because it's too cold.
fuck lemurs for being so damn loud in the middle of the night damn crippled lemur acting stupid at 2am woke me up and fuck the 3 days before Thanksgiving because I had 2 midterms, a large programming assignment and a 1400 word paper draft due all in those 3 days I missed 24 that week and only got 6 hours of sleep over the course of those 3 days ooh you missed a good episode of 24 somebody died, I won't say who though fuck my finals coming up a week from now moving right along
This one comes from Mooheimer.
Hello, Mooheimer.
He says, my fuckyous would be the damn expansion pack enemies in Diablo 2 and dumb weathermen for getting me all excited about a snowstorm that turned into nothing.
Fuck those weathermen.
You know, I actually was going to be a weatherman.
I think that's where it came from.
I don't know.
Anyway.
And then we had some FUs from Martin, who's the guy that sent us the email earlier in the show.
He's got a lot, too.
He says, Fuck Christmas shopping for all the crazy people.
Fuck the crazy people that shop during the Christmas shopping season.
Fuck my manager for making me work the day after Thanksgiving and not giving me hazard pay.
Fuck the blue whale for not living on land.
Fuck my teacher for saying the word land in a question that could have given my class a pizza party.
I don't know what that means.
I'm not saying the word land.
I don't know.
Fuck the African elephant for being so big.
Yes!
Fuck the African elephant.
You're too big!
Too big!
Too big!
Fuck the arcade for banning me for a week for Matrix walking.
Shame, shame, you shouldn't be kicking machines.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Banning's a little harsh.
If they didn't tell you not to do it, then they should at least have a courtesy warning.
But if they warned you and said don't do it, then you did it again, can't have much sympathy for you.
You gotta respect the arcade's rules.
But if they just kicked you out with no warning, that's not cool, so fuck them.
and fuck his computer for not being compatible with 3DXcelic Creator Card.
Again, he must be on a Mac.
Alright, that's it.
That's the FUs of the week.
All of them wrapped into one big little... Oh, I got a response from DDRcoholic.
Says, I can say holic if I want.
because it can be my nickname for her.
So I get to call her DDRholic if I want.
Um, and one quick F you because of the, uh, little image that flashed up on your screen while you were closing down Yahoo.
F you to that stupid movie Extreme Ops because that's the pissed pile of shit I've ever seen.
Look at that!
Ooh, we're gonna add extreme people in a spy situation.
Wait, that's never been done before.
Oh, wait, yeah it was.
So, yeah, F you for these stupid extreme spy movies.
No one wants us to get it, no one cares.
Fuck bad movies.
Fuck Lawyers, Fuck IMAX
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
That's about it on the platter for now.
All sorts of fun.
We're going to start this music break off with a little song from 2DX6Style.
It's a very popular one.
You may have heard it a couple times.
It's going to be in DDR Extreme as well.
Enjoy.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
DJ Ranma S
Hi, we're back.
We're going to do a quick mic check here.
No, see, we're not coming through if I don't turn that booster on.
There, now you can hear us, see?
We're trying to fix our audio problems right now here in-house.
Let me see if we can turn down the volume a little bit.
Can you still hear us just fine?
Hello, hello.
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
I still hear it a little bit, though.
It's so annoying.
I don't know what's causing that, you guys.
I apologize.
We're trying to do what we can.
I may have to just kind of throw the computer against a brick wall this week and see if we can't fix it that way.
We'll pick up the pieces and put it back together with duct tape.
Mute your line in.
The line in is muted.
I don't know.
I don't know, you guys.
I'm sorry.
We'll figure it out.
We'll see what we can do about the popping.
Just deal.
In the meantime, here's something from Poppin' Music.
We're going to play for you guys.
And then we will be right back.
Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching!
From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bomani stuff, comes our Bomani science lesson of the day.
Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.
Hooray, a fan-made promo we got.
And it's tack.
And it has tack, so it already gets Jamie's seal of approval.
We like that.
Thank you, 23Megas, for sending us that promo.
Although it is a little quiet.
You do want to double-check and make sure that it's always nice and loud, that your levels are somewhere in the yellow.
Not in the red, but just at the tip of the yellow.
Just a little recording advice tip from me.
But otherwise, fantastic.
We love it.
Um, let's see, let's talk about some actual Bamani news this week, shall we?
No!
Well, it's not really news, but just kind of some interesting little things.
Is it Bamani Olds?
Yeah, it's Bamani Olds.
There was an interesting thread that came up on one of the big message boards this week that talks about a solo machine that was upgraded to a Max 2.
What?
Somebody took a solo machine and upgraded it to a Max 2.
What is the freaking point?
Because if you recall, Max 2 has no six-panel mode in it, so you've pretty much just taken two of your arrows and completely wasted them.
I'm bringing up pictures here in the room so that Jamie can take a look for herself, see what this machine's all about.
What do you think it... Loki, I gotta get your opinion on this, being the tech massa.
Wait, it curves the bar forward.
Well, that's a typical solo bar.
A solo bar looks like that.
That's different than Max 2.
That means it's actually a Japanese machine, by the way.
You can rate the bar in a whole new way.
That's a Japanese machine.
Okay.
They just put a DDR Max upgrade in the solo machine.
What more do you need to know?
That's all they did.
There's no modifications to it at all.
There's just no way they're going to play doubles.
And it's actually kind of retarded because if you play doubles, you're fucked.
Yeah, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at the solos, or the doubles score ranking here.
It's always going to be empty, forever.
You're fucked if you pick doubles, so it's guitar, unless it's your own home thing, and that's all you've got, it's a solo machine, but...
It's really stupid.
Go to 4th Plus or even that unofficial 5th Mix.
Don't stick with it.
Here's the cream of the crop.
As it says in the post, I believe it says in the post somewhere, it says later, oh yeah, and then there's a regular Max 2 machine, just two machines over from this.
That's so stupid.
That's retarded.
Don't!
and the retard... That gets the Special Olympic Award stamp of the day.
Go figure, this guy's in Canada.
Just kidding, just kidding.
We love Canadians.
I just want to say controversial things on this program.
What can I say?
Let's see.
That goes with my hatred of the Greek.
Oh wait, it was a Greek?
Yeah, but you have a good reason to hate them because they banned games.
Because they're stupid.
I watched my big fat Greek wedding.
Did you?
Yeah.
That totally sounds like a movie you would not like.
It was alright.
Loki, it sounds like a movie.
Oh, Brad, what do you think of this?
It's a Max 2 solo machine.
I'm gonna go play Animal Crossing.
Good answer, good answer.
That wins my special-enough-for-the-Olympic-stamp award of the day.
They get to ride the short bus.
With their own max solo machine, ooh.
The only thing that could be possibly worse than a max two solo machine is a max one solo machine.
Or a solo bass.
No, I think a solo bass is slightly better.
At least it has my baby mama.
I got even better.
I wouldn't exactly say upgrading.
Downgrading a Max 2 full machine to a solo bass.
That's retarded right there.
The only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is somebody playing Burning Heat on that Max 2 solo machine.
God.
Okay.
Oh, yes, yes.
I know this is a few episodes back, but the only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is Upskirt Beatmania 5Key.
No, the cam.
Anyway.
Let's talk about another topic, shall we?
Next, please.
Moving right along.
Oh, yes.
We were talking about another interesting thread that I saw was about this kind of... Since the Christmas season is here, there's this sudden push, and DDR is getting bigger and bigger and more and more well-known.
Bigger and bitter.
We're all getting bitter as the jaded old schoolers we are.
We see that there's...
There's these new children's Dance Pats games coming out, including a Barney game, a Barbie dance game that you plug directly into your TV.
That's been out for a while, but of course it's Christmas time, so a lot of the stores are pushing these again.
You know, here's a Christmas toy that won't make your kid fat.
That's basically how they're marketing these.
This is very old.
The Jungle Book dancing game.
Now for those who don't know out there, this was out before Max USA even was.
I remember going to your old apartment.
I had the Jungle Book dance game.
Playing on that tiny ass little pad.
The Jungle Book dance pad was my very first dance pad.
I actually have the Jungle Book game too, but I don't have the pad.
and Jamie brought over third mix one night and we played all night long.
It was so much fun.
Here, let me liberate your mind.
It was beautiful.
Before that, all I'd ever seen was USA and first mix and all of a sudden you put in third mix.
I'm like, oh my god.
There's modes.
Holiday, erotic, I'm in love.
and it has karaoke mode too!
Yes, in karaoke mode!
Which there has never been in another mix.
Now, what do you guys think of all these little kid games?
Do you think it's good for the money because it trains them at a young age?
I want the Hello Kitty DDR.
This is for five year olds.
It's actually a DDR.
Where's the Oha Kids arcade games?
Don't they have one in Vegas?
Did you say that one arcade you went to, they had a DDR for kids?
No.
I'm just on crack, I'm sorry.
They had Radiant Silvergun.
Oh.
Who had the DDR for kids?
I could have sworn somebody told me somebody in Vegas had them.
I think it was in San Fran, I think.
Frisco.
Very interesting.
Let's see, uh, I wouldn't call, some people in the chat room are talking about Disney's, Disney's Rave being a kid game.
Or, I'm sorry, Disney Mix in the U.S.
I don't know, I don't, it's, you think Disney's Mix is for kids?
I think Dance Magic makes Disney Mix, though.
Disney's Rave is for, like, people who are like, I would like Parapara, but I want to get in the DDR.
Boom, there you go.
That's what it is.
It's just all, it's DDR Parapara Mix.
VidPower, who's from Vegas, by the way, is confirming they do have a DDR Kids machine there.
I don't know if that means it's OHA.
Is it OHA songs?
VidPower, what are the songs in DDR Kids?
Is it OHA stuff, or what is it?
I'm just kind of asking questions to our chat room, waiting for a reply.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
Yeah.
OHA.
What are you guys talking about over there?
We're talking about Gameland in Las Vegas.
Okay, talk about Gameland.
Now, Gameland has DDR Kids.
It's being confirmed by VidPower.
VidPower's from Vegas.
Then they must have gotten it after I played there, because I was there for the DDR Kids moderator trip.
And what they had, I went in there, and this is actually, when everybody was quoting each other what we said for the moderator trip, this is what I was quoted as going, Silvergun!
Oh, it's not OHA songs, I'm being corrected.
It's just different songs.
That's all I can get.
Special.
Different places!
Hey, get us a song list.
Yeah, get us a song list.
We want to talk about it.
We want to come play.
We're going to go to Vegas.
We're planning an Orange Lounge Vegas trip at some point.
Yeah, and someone can pay for it.
Oh, VidPower does confirm they got it after you were there.
Okay.
So...
Yeah, we're gonna have to go play DDR Kids Mix.
That sounds like fun.
It's certainly better than anything that bitch Barbie can come up with.
I'm sorry, yes?
Did you say Barbie or Barney?
They have them both.
Oh my god, I'm not going to dance to I Love You, You Love Me.
And they're both bitches.
Almost.
By the way, your shirt's cool.
I know.
Brad is wearing an 8-bit theater shirt.
I know, I probably mentioned this on the radio already.
It's a black mage.
Yeah, it says Bolt 2, motherfucker.
Sick.
Other big things in the news.
This is big news.
It has really nothing to do with Bimani, but it's big news in the gaming world.
As most Bimani people are a bunch of big gaming addicts, we thought we'd mention it.
Square and Enix.
Enix Bot Square did this little merger type thing?
I thought that it was a merger of equals because of their name.
Yeah, it's a merger of equals.
No, but once I looked at the stuff, I'm going to have to go check the business site to confirm it, but I think that Enix holds a 70-80% share, so it's not a pure merger of equals.
If it was a merger of equals, the ratio would be no more than 10% different.
Any thoughts on what's going to happen because of this?
We're going to be getting Final Quest Fantasy X with all of the art done by Toriyama.
Urgits!
Urgits!
I want more Urgits!
Really, the fighting game, right?
Air Guys.
We're going to get Air Guys with the Dragon Quest characters.
Well, you know, didn't Enix, weren't they responsible for Buster Groove?
Bust a Move Yes, Anex and Metro were responsible for Bust a Move and Bust a Move 2 They're also, you know, I still haven't gotten to play Bust a Move 2001 or whatever the hell it was DDR Bust a Move 2003 with Cloud and Yuffie, oh my god
I honestly don't think they're going to be lame and start crossing all their storylines.
I don't think a damn thing's going to change.
Actraiser was the best game ever.
I'm so moist.
Since, what's his name, Uematsu's not going to do Final Fantasy music anymore, they're phasing him out, they need to get that guy who did Actraiser's music.
They need to get him.
That's going to be the best thing about this.
I actually come to think of it, the pre-show disc, I actually have an Overclocked remix of the Fillmore theme.
I love, oh yeah, Act Tracer.
Anyway, Dan and I had a discussion about this, and for anybody who knows me and Dan or has heard me talk about him or us talk,
We're both really major gamers.
We own like 42 video game systems.
Anyway, we were having this discussion and we decided that it might be a good thing because I want to catch Annex up to the modern day and teach Square how to be old school again.
I honestly think this is happening for a couple reasons A. Final Fantasy XI fucking tanked in Japan because they fucked it up they completely fucked up that hard drive thing and the online bad idea Final Fantasy Online was a bad idea Square Japan had nothing to do with the movie and the movie was actually good it just shouldn't have been named Final Fantasy B. The movie fucked it up for Square honestly the movie was decent but it wasn't it was not Final Fantasy
They should not have been called Final Fantasy, did not deserve the Final Fantasy name.
As a movie, the movie was good.
The movie was good, but it wasn't Final Fantasy.
Right, it wasn't Final Fantasy.
Thank you.
That's all I have to say on that.
But, and this is what I always said, well a friend of mine always talked about this too, because the movie was really being designed about the time the 8 was made.
Honestly, the movie should have been a game...
and 8 should have been the movie 8 would have been awesome 8 would have been an excellent movie and it made a horrible game or 10 as the movie but 10, see 10 the thing with Final Fantasy 10 I can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy on a DDR show but hey the thing with Final Fantasy 10
is that the way it's designed is that next generation of movie slash game.
You don't see it as a movie.
It's a cinematic RPG.
Yeah, it's a cinematic RPG.
I would have liked if they created a movie that's kind of a cross between 7 and 10.
Because 7 had really cool futuristic worlds and all the machines and stuff.
And then 10 had that really kick-ass stuff in it too.
I love...
I love that one song, Otherworld, that's in the very beginning.
That's the heavy metal music that's in it.
It's fucking awesome.
I love that song.
Well, you know, one thing, I was reading an interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who was like the best artist in the world, who did all of the original character designs for the first Final Fantasy games, you know, 1 through 6.
He didn't do any of the character designs for 7 or 8.
He did them for 9, but he was very discouraged by the direction that the Final Fantasy series was going in.
Thanks for watching!
It's always for me, them in the Magitek armor walking across the ice plain.
He's teasing me because my voice is cracking.
Oh my god.
Can we just call you Ron Weasley now?
Shut up.
Shut up.
No, he doesn't have the right name.
Shut up.
Alright.
We'll just put you in a Ford and have you drive around.
Speaking of Final Fantasy, why don't we get to this week's cage match, shall we?
Unless anything else... Cage match!
Does anybody else have something to say about Square, Enix, merging?
Does anyone really give a shit?
I don't give a shit, personally.
A couple comments ago, you said something about it.
You can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy.
I can make a... I can make a... What is it?
The...
Kevin Bacon thing, Six Degrees, or whatever.
It's probably going to be made by Squaresoft.
Squaresoft made a game called Brave Fenster Musashi.
At the end of Brave Fenster Musashi, there's a music dance game that's pretty much like DDR, but it's, yeah, actually it's like Simon Says.
Really?
There you go, yep.
Damn, I've got to play that game now.
There's a DDR mode in SNK versus Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
That's not Squaresoft.
No, there's DDR.
Everything goes back to Konami.
On a total different tangent here, the chatroom is now trying to put us all with Harry Potter characters.
Jamie, you're now Hermione.
I would not be Hermione, hello?
Okay, because first of all, with every damn sorting test I've ever taken, I always come up Slytherin.
She's Draco, because she's evil.
I'm not that bad.
And I guess that leaves Loki to be Harry Potter.
Get the glasses!
I have glasses and I don't look like Harry Potter.
Here, I've got makeup somewhere.
We can draw, like, a little lightning scar on his head.
I'm not gonna be pansy.
Hello.
Sucks.
April Fool's Day
We could all be having the wool pulled over our eyes on this.
Like I said, I don't think it's really going to matter anyway.
So what?
They merge.
Big fucking deal.
I don't care.
Next.
Next.
Nobody accepts this finishing position.
I'm going to turn on the amp here because I need some in-studio sound to deal with this.
We apologize for the humming again.
We don't know what's causing it.
We're going to take a hammer to the computer after the show and figure out what's going on.
So we apologize.
It's something to do with the mics.
Maybe our mics are just cheap.
I don't know.
DarkSakura.com
We're going to play a couple songs all the way through, and then we're going to review them.
Actually, we're just going to play a clip.
You can vote for last week's winner, but we're only going to play a small clip of it.
Because you all have been listening to our Bomani Music Amore program, airing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're not on, and you've heard it already, right?
Yes?
You don't need to play it all again.
So we're going to give our opinions on the songs again.
Of course, the new one's going to be played all the way through.
You, as the chat room, get to decide which one of these is going to be our next big thing.
Yes, so the winner of the cage match will be put into rotation on the normal Bimani Music and More program this week.
So you're going to vote for a winner.
Now, you can vote for last week's victor.
But once last week's winner wins what?
Once the song wins what?
Three, four weeks, we retire it and it can't win anymore.
What do we think?
Four weeks?
Three?
We give it a month.
We give it a month.
Okay, so four weeks.
If a song wins for four weeks, it gets retired.
Yeah, then it goes in permanently.
So, this is our winner from last week was the Final Fantasy Music DJ.
This was an overclocked remix of... I'm sorry, yes, Loki, would you like to explain last week's feature?
It was a remix from Final Fantasy 7.
It's the...
Alright, that was last week's Victor, the Coral Prison remix theme.
That was an overclocked remix by FFMusicDJ.
So you can vote for that, or you can vote for something new!
It's new!
And in the mix this week we have, this is something from the pre-show, but it's so fucking cool, we're putting it in the cage match.
Jamie, please tell us.
I was looking for happy hardcore remakes last night, and I filmed the Knight Rider theme.
Never knows the hair.
David Hasselhoff was just like, in the 80s he was cool.
David Hasselhoff, he's so dreamy.
And then there was Baywatch, and he's loved in Germany.
I think we should just play this song.
Alright, so the first song, and remember you cannot vote until the second song is finished playing.
So we're going to play the first song for you in today's cage match.
This is the Knight Rider theme from Happy Hardcore.
Enjoy.
My bad, it's not from Happy To Be Hardcore, it's just a random mix.
But here it is.
Thanks for watching!
All right, the cage match is in effect here on Orange Lounge Radio.
That was the Knight Rider theme.
What did you guys think of that here in the room?
Jamie?
God damn, that was cool.
All right.
Dave, what did you think of the Knight Rider theme?
It was pretty cool.
Yeah, it was pretty cool.
All right.
Loki?
I liked it.
I liked the original theme.
It kind of lost a little bit of it in the middle there.
I liked the 20s.
I liked the 20s.
Bradley, your thoughts on the Knight Rider mix?
Pretty good.
I'd have to say it's cool for about the first minute when that nostalgia kicks in, but three minutes of it is a little bit much.
I don't know.
Alright, rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.
Jamie, on a scale of 1 to 10.
9, Dave, 8, Loki, 8, Bradley, 7, and I'll give it a 7.5.
Alright, so I'm a harsh judge, what can I say?
Alright, that was the Knight Rider theme.
So, we got one more song here for the cage match, and I'm going to play that for you right now.
It's coming off a CD, so I don't know how this is going to work.
Might be a little weird, but Loki, why don't you intro this for me, please?
This is going to be, it's off of their brand new CD, Community Service.
This is a remix done by Hybrid of the Crystal Method, the name of the game.
It's Hybrid's LA Blackout remix.
Alright, this is the second one in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.
This is the Crystal Method with the name of the game.
Call it more friends!
All right, that was Crystal Method with the name of the game.
Jamie, your thoughts on that?
Oh, you're yawning over there.
It's a little boring to you.
Okay, I see.
Dave, your thoughts?
Loki had the right idea.
Cut it down.
It's a shorter time.
Yes.
Brad's in the room.
What did you think of that?
You didn't get to comment on the last one.
What did you think of this one?
Well, the original last song has always been my favorite Crystal Method song ever.
I've always said that DC and DX and I would love to do it next as well.
But, hey, I don't know if I can do it.
I don't know if I can do it.
Loki, what did you think of it?
I like the song.
Obviously, yes, it was too long.
The original one is also my favorite Christmas song ever.
I do have to add, though, that this is my turn.
It's the perfect pre-entry.
Except I've cut it down to two and a half minutes.
No longer is it two and a half minutes, but yeah, I like it.
Bradley, your thoughts?
I've been really good at that one.
I've been really good at that one.
Uh...
My thoughts, it's a cool song for a minute and a half.
Same thing as the last song.
A little long, a little long for me, but I bet it's going to kick a lot of ass in DDR, a DDR edit.
Let's break it down, scale of 1 to 10.
Jamie?
It had lots of parts that I liked, and I thought they were good.
I give it a 6.5.
6.5 from Jamie.
Dave?
Yeah, I mean, whenever it switched to a new part, then it was cool, but then it kept going on that part for like a minute and a half each.
So, um, I'll be generous.
I'll give it a 7.
7.
Brad.
Since I didn't hear their whole song, I have to be fair.
I guess I can't give it a 10 or anything.
But I mean, it sounded good when I heard it, so I guess I'll give it a 7.
7.
Loki.
Well, I can be biased because it's my song, so I'm giving it a 10.
Alright, 10.
Bradley.
I'll give it a 10.
I give it a 6.5 as well.
Alright, there's your votes.
So, now it's time for the important people to vote.
That's you in the chatroom.
Send me your votes over private message.
Send your votes over private message to Sky in the chatroom right now and we will reveal the votes.
These, once again, are your choices.
You can vote for last week's winner.
The Final Fantasy Music DJ with a remix of Choral Prison.
String Machine.
You can vote for Happy Hardcore Knight Rider theme.
Or you can vote for The Crystal Method, the name of the game.
Those are your choices.
Send your votes in right now.
And don't send them over DCC chat.
I can't accept those during the show.
You've got to send them over normal private message.
Yes.
Yes.
Gumby.
Gumby, you should know better.
God.
Gee.
Someone who has his own little team should know...
I'm just fucking with him.
I'm giving him a hard time because I can.
Gumby likes it when I give him a hard time.
Wink wink, nudge nudge.
Say no more.
Alright, we'll be revealing those votes in a little bit.
Moving right along though, we're going to talk about...
Oh, our new web forums!
Everybody else has new sites and forums.
Why can't we?
We've got new forums.
So visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and click on forums.
And we've got some brand new forums that you can peruse.
Now, I have to state, though, they're very temporary and they're not the best forums because they're free.
They're not EasyBoard because I fucking hate EasyBoard and I wouldn't use them.
So, I use somebody else, excellent service, my ICOM board, you know, for somebody just trying to get started with a message board, it's great.
It is going to be temporary though until I've got some extra money and can buy another host.
Or somebody is very gracious and donates some space where we can put, you know, a PHP BB or something.
So...
You should visit that web board.
Oh yes, please mention the LiveJournal community.
There's always that.
If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, all one word, that is where our LiveJournal community is.
Go check it out.
It's very orange.
Yes, it's very orange.
It's a very pretty design, though.
Thank LiveJournal for that.
I just picked a default that was orange.
You just picked a default scheme.
And then, let's see, what else can we talk about?
I wanted to talk about this really fast, if I can get this to bring up.
What's being released, I believe, this week is a good, cool compilation.
I believe it's Good Cool Songs, and what they did, something about Santa's redone all the songs in English.
I don't know, at least the preview songs on the website, Santa's singing them and they're in English, and you know what?
We're going to get a quick clip of one of those songs for you right here.
Let me see if I can get you one of these.
Okay, we're going to hear a quick clip of one of these songs right here.
I apologize if we do a dropout real fast, but I want to be able to play this clip for you guys, so here we go.
I'm going to turn on the speaker so you guys in-house can hear it.
Let's see if it comes up.
It's loading right now.
I'm trying to get a clip of 19 November from the Good Cool album, which comes out on December 4th, so it comes out this week.
Okay, here we go.
Connecting, la la la la la.
Just trying to connect to the site.
Here it goes.
Here's a small clip of what this will sound like.
That was a little bit of 19 November.
What'd you guys think of that?
Does it make a CD worth buying?
Um, it's good cool since it's worth buying anyway, but, uh... That's English?
Yeah.
I know I'm gonna get, like, a freaking ass-reaming here for saying this, but they should've got freaking, uh... No!
No!
No!
Paul and Terry!
No!
No!
No!
Paul and Terry!
That's fine!
No!
God, leave.
Shoot.
You're banned from Orange Lounge just like Paul and Terry.
No.
Come back, Brad.
Come back, Brad.
We love you.
We still hate Politary.
Why?
Why Politary?
Why?
Because Santa should not be singing in English.
Hell, Santa should not be singing.
She sings because she did very nicely on the Shining Polaris.
Shining Polaris was good.
Yeah.
That's because LED kicks ass.
LED does kick ass.
They should fork out the money and get Utada Hikaru.
Or Ayumi.
Just fork out the money.
Hold on, hold on.
What's awesome is, I don't know if anybody's played the Game Boy Beatmania games, I know that's pretty ghetto, but they've got some pretty cool licensed tracks on there.
They do have a Utah Bakudo song on there.
I played the one on Wonderspawn that has the digitized music.
I played the Beatmania that was on Wonderspawn.
It was all digitized.
Yeah, I have a Wonderspawn color and the little turntable wouldn't fit on my thing very well.
Well, Guitar Freaks has to depend on you.
I can't believe it's not gagged.
No, someone needs to send me that CD for Christmas.
If somebody can get, if before Christmas, as soon as it's out, you know, you want to send us over a copy of the album, we'll get some songs in rotation on the normal, yes, if you can get us a picture, we'll get some tracks on Orange Lounge in regular rotation, the good ones, so we'll see.
Okay, we're going to take a real quick break, we'll be back.
and we're going to talk about this week's list list.
We're going to do a list list tonight and we'll do that and then we're going to reveal the vote winner, getter, top getter, vote getter.
And when the winner wins, they win.
Oh, hello, it's not playing.
Let's see what's going on here.
Just a quick problem.
We've got a quick issue.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
We have some issues, and we think the issues are fixed now, so here we go.
Thank you for watching!
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
The Final Fantasy String Machine and the Knight Rider theme.
And the winner was, with over half the votes, out of three choices, over half the votes, the winner was... Knight Rider theme, ladies and gentlemen.
David Hasselhoff was cool.
Big difference.
Was cool.
Actually, that's borderline cool.
It was great in South Park.
Thank you to everyone who voted.
We appreciate it.
Of course.
Oh, I'm being given a link to the DDR Kids machine.
Let's have a look-see-loo at this.
A look-see-loo.
Oh, my voice got a vote.
for the cage match winner.
Thank you, Gumby.
Actually, I think it was Twin that voted for that, but hey.
Oh, there's a picture of the Danson's Revolution Kids machine.
That's so cheesy.
They were selling one on eBay.
That's so cheesy.
Remember?
They were selling one on eBay.
That's right, they were selling one.
That's probably how the place got it.
It looks like a what, Dave?
A freaky stolen machine, kind of like Mickey Mouse.
I thought you said a sewing machine.
That's what I thought you said, yeah.
It looks like one of those picture maker things, picture tape.
Uh, yeah.
Oh, very cute.
Uh, is there any other pictures of... No, it just shows all the different kinds of DDR.
Alright.
Well, whatever.
Cool.
Let's see.
Oh, a deer.
Top hits don't count.
Top hits is ass.
I'm afraid to look at this.
Oh, that's cute.
That's very cute.
Lovely.
An Orange Lounge boy-on-boy mix signature.
Beautiful.
I like boy-on-boy action.
Beautiful.
Ah, you gotta love the intelligence of our listeners.
That was twin, of course.
Who sends all the shocking weird shit?
Just like, who sends the funny, good, shocking, weird shit?
That was like what, Pyroman and the OSVB send that stuff.
Who sends the shocking, weird shit that really is shocking and weird?
That's Twin.
Yeah.
Alright.
So I think that we should move right along to our next game show.
I think we should move right into our next game show.
But we're going to first back this up with a story.
I wanted to talk about this a little bit because it's the holidays.
A story.
A story.
I gotta find this story.
And I'm logged into the wrong account right now.
I'm not going to be able to pull up the story.
Hold on.
Jamie, tell a story about your day or something.
I need time to fill here.
I did laundry today, Rob.
I washed my pants.
A clean DDR is a fun DDR and a happy DDR.
Yeah.
I played Kingdom Hearts, and then I played Max USA, and I don't know, it's so stupid how you have to play all these songs, because I've already done everything there is to do right now, and I've got nothing left to do except try to unlock songs.
And then, Dazley Never, because they ended with getting hit in the head with a weasel.
Well, no, he lit the menorah, too, right?
I do that when I get back.
Oh, you do that when you get back.
Orange Lounge comes first.
Orange Lounge always comes.
Orange Lounge is above all holy holidays.
You've seen Rob Schneider as a gigolo.
You've seen Rob Schneider as a woman.
Now, see Rob Schneider as a stapler.
Oh, crap.
I'm being given some interesting stuff, and this is coming from Gumby.
So you know this is going to be weird.
Let's see.
Gumby is sending me an article on... Good scene.
It says Gatsas in the title, which sounds like, I don't know, it's not loading.
Gumby, thy link is broken.
You suck.
You lose.
Maybe it's just because we're trying to broadcast a show and we can't see it right now.
Let's see.
I'm just following random links that the chatroom's sending me.
This is scary.
Oh, that's cute.
That's very cute.
He sent me a picture of Counter-Strike where somebody's got little red octane dance pads there and they give 100 health, apparently.
Or they take 100 health, more likely.
They also take 100 intelligence.
Ah, kill me.
Oh, I, let's see, I need to find this news article I was looking for, my bad.
Brad, tell us about your day.
I was, I was over, you know, I was over here at 4 a.m.
Pretend you don't know and tell me again.
Fuck you.
Okay, I was over here at 4 a.m.
playing your Animal Crossing.
We left, we went to bed, we woke up at 1 p.m.
Yes, we have lives, and we came over here and played more.
Rob, how was your day?
My day was fabulous, thank you for asking.
You haven't told us.
I got the link up that I wanted, thank you.
Oh yes, we're going to talk about, because the day... Rob got it up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
And on the show too.
You woman... anyway.
Yeah, hello.
Go play your Grand Theft Auto woman mix in your Miata and your VW Bug.
Bullshit, I'd have the terrain of... Anyway, we want to talk about the day after Thanksgiving is commonly known as the Oh Fuck Stay Away From The Mall Day.
In other words... Black Friday.
Black Friday.
Black Friday.
The day when you do not want to be caught dead anywhere near a mall because it's that time of year to go shopping.
I went to the mall.
And of course, every year they release the list of the top holiday toys.
So I thought they've compiled a list.
This station, WESH, I have no idea where they're located.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter where they're located.
They're W, so they're East Coast.
They're somewhere East Coast.
They're stating it's a great time to start your Christmas shopping.
You can beat the rush and the shelves are stocked.
But what's going to be popular this year?
You know how kids are in general.
They don't care how much a toy costs or who makes it.
They just want to have fun.
So Yahoo site for kids, Yahooligans, gave kids a chance to vote for toys on their wish list.
And these are the top five toys that kids are looking for for Christmas this year.
The number five, this is amazing to me, the number five toy, Singing Stars Video Karaoke.
It allows kids to become the next superstar.
It's a $100 karaoke machine.
It's like American Idol, except that you don't have to get bitched at.
That should be the add-on.
It's like, get a little British guy to bitch at you and yell and tell you that you're no good.
The future generation of single, old people.
Come over to my house, I'll bitch at you.
Drunken, in a bar, singing drunken music from times when they remember they were young.
Yeah.
We're gonna be high on pixie sticks.
I weep for the future.
Moving right along, the number four Christmas toy.
The Yu-Gi-Oh!
Trading Card Game.
I cry for America.
Okay, the concept of this whole Yu-Gi-Oh!
thing is just shit.
1991.
Card games are cool, people just love watching card games, they don't like participating in card games, but watching them are really fun.
Especially when little holographic things happen.
No.
Crap.
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
Not to mention the thing came out in 1991.
Crap.
And crap.
Alright, so that was the number four holiday toy this year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait, so, hold on.
The Yu-Gi-Oh!
trading card game, are they talking about like a pack of nine cards costs just under nine dollars?
That's what the website says.
I believe everything I read online, so.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
Jamie, why don't you tell us what the number three Christmas toy is this year?
Password Journal 2.
It allows girls to keep a secret diary and cost $20.
Ooh, you can keep a secret diary.
I have a live journal.
You have a live journal.
Get your kids online and teach them how to type so they can be good little sexertaries when they get older.
Sexertaries.
A password journal.
It's not a password journal.
It's Password Journal 2 is the number three toy.
No, it's the Password Journal 2, not 2DX, it's just the Password Journal 2.
The number two Christmas toy this holiday season for little Bratz is the Bratz Funky Fashion Makeover.
It's a spin-off of the popular Bratz dolls, and it costs $25.
Yeah, those things are stupid.
I don't even know what the fuck it is.
My mom would not let me get gem dolls because she thought that their heads were too big, like crack babies.
These make the gem dolls look tame, okay?
However, the boy ones are kind of cool.
DarkSakura.com
Seriously?
That totally sounds like something they'd sell in the Castro.
How do you mean seriously?
I mean, they can't market something like that.
You can in the Castro.
He wore a ring.
It was supposed to be like a medallion, a ring around his neck on a chain.
Ring around the cocky.
And it was a cock ring.
Now, was it like magnum size or... I don't know.
I didn't have one.
Magnum size.
Next!
The number one toy this holiday season, Jamie, what is it?
A Game Boy Advance.
Yes, that's right.
If you have to ask what a Game Boy Advance is, then go back and bury your head back in the hole.
Now, obviously, we here in the room disagree with this list completely.
So we are going to give you, during this next listless segment, our top three...
Video game related things we want for Christmas or we think somebody should have for Christmas.
So it's our top three video game, video gamers Christmas list.
And we're going to do that.
We're going to take a quick break so we can prepare our list and then we'll be right back.
So listen to some music real fast.
We're going to keep this really brief because we want to get this done before the show's over.
So why don't you listen to something from...
and 2DX8style.
How about our favorite band?
Why?
Because we took their name.
Orange Lounge from 2DX8style here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Alright, we are back.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and now we're going to start a little thing we call listless here, and I'm trying to find our listless music, although I don't know if I have it queued up.
I might have to substitute a different game show theme because I can't find it.
I'll find it.
Do you remember where I put it?
It's one of the old pre-show things.
I have the Press Your Luck theme.
Play that.
Alright, we're going to play the Press Your Luck theme.
Okay.
Alright, list list here, it's the top holiday toys that we want and you should want for Christmas.
This is the way it works, for those of you that haven't sat in on a list list segment before, because we have some new listeners tonight.
We're going to give all of our, in the room, our top three items.
And then we're going to go around the room and take, each of us will take one item off of the list.
That's going to be hard, because we're going to be crushing someone's Christmas dream right there.
It's going to be very difficult tonight, very painful.
Yeah, we'll just eliminate all Lokis like we do every week.
And then once that's done, you guys will vote on the final list.
You'll take your vote and you'll vote on what from that list is your most desired holiday toy.
Video game related.
It doesn't have to be new, no.
Just what you want this holiday season.
Nobody will be able to afford my Christmas.
All right.
Just what you want this holiday season, and the thing that everybody should want this holiday season, because you said so, and you're God.
Okay.
Goddess.
Goddess.
All right, and then the chat room votes on the top three, and that's it.
That's the list.
There is no other list.
All right.
Let's start with Loki.
Give us your number three pick for the must-have Christmas toy for Loki this season.
I don't know why I won't say this, but I don't have it this season anymore, and I don't want it.
Power Glove!
The Power Glove!
I love the Power Glove.
Loki says everybody... Keep the Power Glove off her.
Boys and girls everywhere need the Power Glove.
Alright, let's move on.
Brad, you're number three choice.
Okay, my number three choice is the PS1 with the combination with the LCD screen.
I want this, I don't have one yet, but I think I want everybody else to get one, so I can mod it for you for a very special price, of course.
All right, a PS1 and LCD screen.
Very good choice.
Dave.
Oh, I think you said pad, because it's the only actual pad that you can play EDR on.
Unless you've got, like, some crazy mod thing.
Alright, an ignition pad says Dave.
I'll go ahead and get my number three pick.
My number three pick this holiday season, what Rob wants, I want the Sims Online.
Nerd.
Because if you think Animal Crossing is bad, just fucking wait until Sims Online, that's all I have to say.
Jamie, your number three pick.
I want the PC Engine Duo RX.
I have to explain this.
Why?
I already own a TurboGrafx Duo.
The PC Engine was what TurboGrafx was in Japan, with the advantage of having a DuoRI that has an arcade card built in, so I can actually play my copy of Strider, and, uh, um, Art, uh, not Artifighting 2, it's, uh, I think Roboutville 3.
That's fucking hardcore.
No, it's Artifighting 2, it's Artifighting 2.
Jamie, you're so hardcore.
And the other thing, I can play Sapphire.
Sapphire is such a fabulous game because it's one of the first 16-bit games that had real polygons in it.
Alright, the chatroom's suggesting, by the way, things such as a mail-order bride should be on the list.
But you guys have to remember, we're talking video game-related things, so... Video game?
Do you think a mail-order bride?
Yeah, I guess if you play video games, that's the only way you're ever going to get married, is by ordering one.
No, they can sit there and watch me play video games.
Exceptions to every rule.
Exceptions to every rule.
ITs, ITs.
All right, moving on.
Number two choice.
My number two choice, I was going to go with now the... It has the hidden cameras in the center square there, but... And I decided, no, probably shouldn't do that because I'd have no use for them.
I decided to go with the official Konami metal stages.
Two of them.
Every boy and girl wants a Konami Metal stage.
Moving right along, Brad.
A GameCube with Animal Crossing.
Matt?
It didn't happen to me with GameCube and Animal Crossing.
It happened to me with the Sega CD and Eternal Champions.
Hardcore.
All right, Dave, your number two choice.
My number two choice is a DD Rex machine.
I'm sorry, a DDR EX machine?
Yes.
What is that?
Oh, Extreme.
Oh, my bad.
Oh, I don't know the lingo yet.
I'm sorry.
I'm not down with it.
I'm not jiggy with the lingo.
My bad.
It's the new Metal Gear, DD Rex.
All right.
My number two pick for a must-have this holiday season, Kansas City Star on 9.
And you have to have the broadband, but that's a secret code.
Of course.
That's a given.
Jamie, your number two pick.
My number two pick.
It was almost my number one pick, but I had to think of my priorities.
I want a Beatmania 2DX Arcade Style Controller.
I had my chance to get one.
I had to think order, okay?
We had everything together.
Your credit card's not the right kind.
We can't accept it.
So we're canceling your order.
Oh, shit.
All right, coming on down to the number one picks.
Loki, your number one must-have gift this holiday season.
Well, since Dave took mine, I'm going to have to one-up him.
I'm going to go for a 2DX machine.
We'll go with 8th style.
Boy, you will have had to have been extra good this year for Santa to bring you one of those.
That was really good.
Or Hanukkah Harry in days past.
You stole my number one, that bitch.
All right, Dave, you're number one must-have this holiday season.
I'm sorry, Brad.
What, am I not here?
I'm looking right at you, and I called you Dave.
You make a better door than you do a window.
Um, mine, you know, this is a little, I'm a little outdated.
I want an American PS2, because I've had a JPS2 all along.
I've got a lot of American games to catch up on.
What, Matt?
Yeah, take yours back.
Yes, I can.
All right, fine.
All right.
I want a JPS2.
You want a JPS2.
Dave, you say the 2DX machine and we're all set.
Wait, actually, Loki, say the 2DX.
Okay, you say 2DX.
I say a JPS-2 with 2DX and the controller.
There we go.
Good lord.
Alright, fine.
I'm throwing a memory card.
Fair enough.
I think we have it all worked out now.
Alright, my number one pick is...
Yes, I'm trendy, so what?
Fuck you.
I'm not doing number one yet, are we?
No, okay, never mind, I'll try that one last.
Yeah, okay.
And I'll make it first.
We'll see, this time you go last.
Alright.
My number one pick, yes, I'm trendy, fuck you, Metroid Prime.
Hey, I have that game.
It's pretty.
Okay, I hate first person shooters, but this game is fabulous.
Alright.
Jamie, your number one pick, please.
Unofficial Konami Drum Mania controller, Richard.
Drum Mania.
You know, I have every other controller except the damn Drum Mania controller.
And I don't have a top of music controller, but I'm not as hyper about that.
Okay.
You can get drum controllers if you know where to look, but I need a Drum Mania controller.
Here's the list so far.
A Power Glove, a PS1 LCD screen...
Ignition Pad, The Sims Online, a PC Engine Duo RX, Konami Metal Stages, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, DDR EX, Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX Arcade Controller, Japanese PS2, American PS2, a 2DX Machine, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania Controller and Drum Mania.
Wow.
I don't know how we're going to possibly do the elimination round, but... Oh well, Christmases are about to be ruined here on Orange Lounge Radio.
I don't know how people are expecting to pay for all this shit.
I mean, like...
Everything that I picked is in excess of $200.
So, I don't know, I guess you're going to vote for the thing you least would want to see under your tree.
I have no idea how you're going to make a selection here, but just fucking do it.
Or your menorah, as the case may be.
Okay, in the back in the peanut gallery, Neal's asking... Don't you get eight days of presents, so...
So, uh, you get, like, your 2DX machine in pieces.
Here's the monitor!
Here's the key!
Actually, I got fucking gypped this Hanukkah.
All I got was DDR Max.
But, hopefully, because, like, my birthday comes, like, a day after Christmas, so normally they make up for it with better shit on my birthday.
Yeah, you got your priorities in order, you know.
Good little Jewish boy.
What the hell are you talking about?
Christmas and Hanukkah are all about presents.
Yeah, they're about... Yeah, present.
They're about Jesus or not.
Anyway.
Can we finish?
Can we finish?
Can we finish?
Alright.
Here we go.
Loki, take... Ruin someone's Christmas right now.
What don't you want for Christmas?
Well, since I don't play it at all, 2DX Machine.
Oh, 2DX Machine.
Going straight for the gut.
Just go play one at Scandia when it arrives.
He's just going to play one at Scandia whenever it arrives.
All right, Brad.
It's time for you to ruin Christmas and Hanukkah for somebody.
Just for that, Matt.
Power Glove.
Say goodbye.
Oh!
Oh, no, you didn't.
No, you did not take out the Power Glove.
I have the Power Glove, and it sucks.
The chat room will have your head for that, Brad.
Okay.
My turn?
Dave's turn.
Metal Stages.
Metal Stages.
Fuck you, Loki.
Where the hell was that?
Oh, yes, the Konami Metal Stages.
There it is.
Alright.
I would purposely go after you and take off the JPS2, but that was my number two choice.
Never mind.
That was going to be one of my choices.
My number one to come off the list...
God, I'm going to take off the PS1 LCD screen because I'm taking that off because the PS1 is so last year.
You know what?
I'm looking at this list and I own probably most of the stuff that's on it already.
You don't own an EX machine.
I said most of this stuff, not all of it.
Because I have a JPS2, an American PS2, a Metroid Prime, and a GameCube and Animal Crossing.
Toot the little horn.
And I actually have a beta of Sims Online.
Let's take off.
I prefer not to be lagged, thank you.
Jamie, why don't you read off the final list here?
Oh, wait, I've got to make sure this is copied right and not some porn site or something is going to post all over the chat room.
I've got to make sure.
Can't hide porn.
All right, why don't you read off this list, Jamie, and they can vote for it right now in the chat room.
Really, pimp tricks are for hoes.
We have an ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX.
How did that stay?
Because it's the coolest video game system ever.
You can play Dracula X on it, okay?
GameCube with Animal Crossing, DDR Extreme, Phantasy Star Online, and of course you have to have the adapter with it, 2DX Arcade style controller, it would help find connections.
Sorry.
Japanese PS2, American PS2, Metroid Prime, and Drummedia controller with Drummedia.
Fabulous.
So, a quick music break while you guys send in your votes.
You're only going to have like two minutes to send me your votes, so do it now.
Now, now, now!
You can send them in over email as well, but hurry up and do it now.
Vote for your favorite, and we will be right back.
We're going to play something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
What?
The bump?
I don't know if I have the bump queued up.
I'm sorry.
How about something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania?
Something there?
Catch your eye?
Monkey Magic.
Monkey Magic.
And then we'll hear Kachaka.
And then we'll come right back.
So that gives you two minutes to vote here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for watching!
All sun and egg on the mountain top The monkey is monkey that ever spoke He knew every magic trick under the sun To tease the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic
Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We're right in the middle of listless.
The topic tonight, the top thing we want most for Christmas or Hanukkah, whatever you happen to celebrate.
And if you were a little kid being sampled by the Hooligans website, the number one pick for them was a Game Boy Advance, which didn't even make our list.
So, you know it's not going to be there.
It means we probably already have one.
Once again, these were the final choices.
An ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, a DDR Extreme machine, which is a miracle because it's not even out until next year, but I'm just going to assume you're talking about a beta.
A Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX controller arcade style.
Japanese PS2 and American PS2, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania controller and Drum Mania.
I just want to say it's the holidays.
Miracles happen this time around, you know.
Miracles do happen.
Thank you.
Thank you, Preachy Dave.
We appreciate that.
Okay, let's read the top ones.
I was trying to find a sound effect file, but I don't have one, so...
Boy, Ren, if you think you're happy now, wait till you hear this.
It's a record of my favorite song.
It's called Happy Happy Joy Joy.
Hello, boys and girls.
This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteek.
The number three winner, Happy Happy Joy Joy, is... A GameCube and Animal Crossing.
Yay, GameCube and Animal Crossing win.
Third place.
Second place winner is...
A 2DX arcade style controller.
Hey, that's the way it works.
Alright, and the winner of Buy a Landslide, might I add.
I don't know why, because it ain't even out yet, but hey.
Nobody gave the chatroom points for being smirks.
Just kidding.
We love our chatters and they did pick a DDR Extreme Machine as the number one must-have holiday present thing.
Also getting honorable mentions, they tried to write in, there was a write-in candidate for Sky's Voice the Game.
I have no idea how that would be played.
I have no idea how that works.
If we're going video game related with the Mail Order Bride, would it be like Ping from Megatokyo?
I don't know.
What?
People who read Megatokyo, Ping is a PS2 accessory.
A life-size human PS2 accessory for dating sims.
Sky's voice, the game, did not garner enough votes.
It doesn't count because it wasn't on our list.
Sheesh.
Yeah, deal with it.
We'll do another list list for my voice later.
Every day is a game with Rob.
Oh, they're saying that Skye's voice the game would be like Parappa the game.
Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.
Or something, like my... In the rain or in the snow, I got the funky flow.
That means he has to pee.
He got the funky flow from eating too much beans.
Oh, dear good lord.
Alright, it's about time to end the show.
Believe it or not, we've made it for three hours.
Oh, shit, we've got to do Loki's sim update.
My bad.
My bad.
Way to go there, Rob.
Ah, shit, I thought we could get through one show without it.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Yes, give us your sim update, Loki.
Make it quick.
Not too much going on.
We've got DWI, new version now, I believe they're up in LA.
3Tubers, I don't know who cares, it doesn't really matter.
Um, the whole point is that they have karaoke now, um, is the lyrics.
You know, from 3rd Mix you were talking about earlier, that is now featured in EGWI.
Oh, shit.
And so people are actually, you know, making lyrics for songs and that wonderful stuff.
And also they have the audition for special characters, you know, like the hearts and Japanese characters and stuff.
They have that available now free to...
So go check that out.
Also, for all you Bomani Ruler DWI fans out there, on DDRmaniaX, you'll probably see a post in the user-submitted files saying something about a share.
DWI.
Well, guess what?
That's not shared.
That is the return.
The last final Bimani Ruler unreleased track that you need to go download because it's supposed to be good, but I tried it and it's just four-key beat mania.
But anyways, have fun with that.
So yeah, also Tourney Mix 3 is going to be, you know, enter that if you haven't yet and it'll be fun.
They should be posting up files probably at the end of December.
How about MakeEditGetPorn?
Give us an update on MakeEditGetPorn.
Well, I haven't really come up with a date yet.
I'm acquiring more stuff to go in the boxes.
Yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on there.
I'll announce a date when we do have one.
Um, aside from that, really not too much going on, just, um, check out DDRUK, do donate the money, because they're kind of short on money, but they do have, uh, you know, the Dancing Stage Party Edition files up, and also, um, you know, pretty much almost everything else, official-wise, so, go check it out, they have six sets for you to download, so, yeah, that's it.
Oh, oh, oh, and one more thing, now, it's my understanding, you know, I'm not really sure about the Naoki Journal, because I can't read Japanese, but I believe that this is the last one.
Wah!
I cried.
Next.
That's it.
Jamie, oh yeah, I guess it's that time to give our final thoughts of the night.
Jamie?
Um, just one little thing.
I got BMX XXX for free, and it sucks.
But you can pick up the hoe and take her to her pimp.
That's all.
And for that, it's worth buying.
Loki's worth getting it for free.
Loki, your final thought, please.
If you get Sci-Fi, tomorrow night at 9 p.m.
is the first of ten two-hour-long mini-movies of Taken.
It's one of the most awesome series.
It's produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by ten different people.
It's going to be really awesome.
Definitely check it out.
All right.
Will do.
Just for you, Loki.
Okay, um, I just found my Koosh thing.
Dave, yes, you found it.
Yeah, I've had it, like, I brought it over here, I think, two months ago, and left it here, and I was wondering where it was, and then, hey, that guy, I forget his name, was playing with it.
That guy Brad?
No.
That guy Brad, or that guy, uh, uh, Neil?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, him.
Yeah, alright, people in my house that don't participate in Orange Lounge because they don't get the DDR thing.
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, I got 97.5 on nearly 130.
Yay, for me.
Ah, still haven't beat me yet.
What's you?
What are you at?
I'm at like 98-something, I don't know.
What?
I don't know.
On the RVGL machine?
No, not on the RVGL machine.
Is that a second place?
Check the Scandi one.
Check the Scandi one.
Oh, I will beat it.
I know, but the second player side works.
Anyway, who cares about the stomping game?
Penis, penis, penis.
Alright, Bradley, your final thought, please.
That thing is a copy of an aero-beat that I used to have on those things.
An aero-beat?
Yeah, it was like, harder than that.
Supposed to be a thing you could throw the farthest.
Yeah, because now toys are supposed to be non-lethal.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, now that the show is over, the streets are now, once again, safe for Bimani.
Hooray!
Whoa to the Republic.
My final thought is that my voice is not high and funny.
It is deep and sexy.
It's high in fiber.
and I need to get... Rob's voice is high in fiber and fortified with vitamins.
And I need to get laid.
And that's it.
Whale!
Wasn't that special?
I really, really, really need to get laid.
That's it.
Good night.
See you next week.
