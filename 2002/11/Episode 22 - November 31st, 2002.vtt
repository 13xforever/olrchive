00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Oh! Message for you, son! Attention! Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.620
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.620 --> 00:34.620
Just kidding.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.620
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.620
In this episode...

00:36.620 --> 00:37.620
Hey, are there any boys down there?

00:37.620 --> 00:38.620
That's the biggest girl you've ever seen, Jingle Berry.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.620
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:39.620 --> 00:40.620
Showgirls.

00:40.620 --> 00:41.620
Absolute frightful.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.620
What's yours?

00:42.620 --> 00:54.820
There are no stupid questions.

00:54.820 --> 00:55.820
Just stupid people.

00:55.820 --> 00:56.820
Don't torture yourself.

00:56.820 --> 00:57.820
That's my job.

00:57.820 --> 00:59.820
Now's the time on Scrockets, baby dogs!

01:00.820 --> 01:03.820
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:04.820 --> 01:05.820
I don't come through.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.820
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.820
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:11.820 --> 01:15.820
No! What I expect for punishing positions is gentle.

01:15.820 --> 01:18.820
Hey!

01:19.820 --> 01:23.820
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

01:23.820 --> 01:30.820
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex and wait.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.820
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

01:33.820 --> 01:35.820
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.820
I find it funny.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.820
We are live, and this is episode number 22 for December the 1st of 2002.

01:42.820 --> 01:49.820
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most hideous, no just kidding, most unhideous radio station of all things Bimani.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.820
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

01:52.820 --> 01:57.620
Joining me as always is my awesome co-host in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

01:57.620 --> 01:58.980
farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
You know her better.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
It's Darksekara.

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
I have nuts.

02:01.980 --> 02:02.980
Yes, you have some nice...

02:02.980 --> 02:04.340
They're tasty, unsalted nuts.

02:04.340 --> 02:05.880
They're lovely and unsalted.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.580
They're a true joy to lick.

02:07.580 --> 02:08.580
Fashions are good for you.

02:08.580 --> 02:09.580
We appreciate that.

02:09.580 --> 02:10.580
They're high in protein.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.580
They're a fiber.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.100
And in that corner, say hello to the one and only Tech Massa.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.100
It's Loki.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.100
Hey, everybody.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.100
Hey, how you doing?

02:17.100 --> 02:18.100
I'm doing good.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.100
Very good.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.100
Very good.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.100
All right.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.100
I'm gonna eat my nuts.

02:22.100 --> 02:28.740
Okay, I have had a cry for you, Dark Sakura.

02:28.740 --> 02:38.980
Also tonight with us in studio, say hello to Brad, Nike-style, and the happy little

02:38.980 --> 02:39.980
Panda Rice Princess.

02:39.980 --> 02:40.980
Say hello to Irene.

02:40.980 --> 02:44.980
Hi, I'm with the Panda Rice Princess, too.

02:44.980 --> 02:45.980
Addicts.

02:45.980 --> 02:47.180
You're all addicts.

02:47.180 --> 02:48.180
We'll be talking to them more.

02:48.180 --> 02:51.220
We're going to do a list list tonight, so they'll be back for a list list a little later

02:51.220 --> 02:56.380
in the show. First we're going to take a really quick break, feature you some requests, and

02:56.380 --> 02:59.460
we're going to eat more nuts, and we'll be right back to talk about all things Bahmani,

02:59.460 --> 03:00.460
and then some. See you then!

03:00.460 --> 03:02.460
See you then!

04:30.460 --> 04:32.460
Don't turn off the lights

04:32.460 --> 04:34.560
Be-be-be be good

05:02.460 --> 05:14.460
I'll be there, I'll be there I'll be there, I'll be there

05:14.460 --> 05:19.460
We will die if you love me

05:19.460 --> 05:24.460
We'll take a party on your table

05:24.460 --> 05:29.460
And we'll never know when to say

05:29.460 --> 05:32.460
You love me, kiss me

05:32.460 --> 05:35.460
We'll bring hair and say

05:35.460 --> 05:39.460
I'm so free now

05:39.460 --> 05:48.180
Why bother every night to get the shot?

05:48.180 --> 05:54.660
All you're leaving is what you want

05:54.660 --> 06:01.780
Every night I'll be here tonight

06:01.780 --> 06:09.140
Maybe this year won't come soon enough

06:09.140 --> 06:18.140
They took the credit for your second symphony We're written by machine and you take the last G

06:18.140 --> 06:29.140
And now I understand the problems you can see I met your children What did you tell them?

06:29.140 --> 06:36.140
Video killed the radio star, video killed the radio star

06:36.140 --> 06:40.140
The tears came and broke your heart

06:44.140 --> 06:47.140
And now we meet in an abandoned studio

06:47.140 --> 06:51.140
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

06:51.140 --> 06:55.140
And you remember the jingles used to go

06:55.140 --> 06:59.140
Oh oh, you were the first one

06:59.140 --> 07:02.140
Oh oh, you were the last one

07:02.140 --> 07:06.140
Video killed the radio star

07:06.140 --> 07:09.140
Video killed the radio star

07:09.140 --> 07:13.140
In my mind and in my car

07:13.140 --> 07:17.140
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

07:17.140 --> 07:19.140
Oh

07:47.140 --> 07:49.140
Oh

08:17.140 --> 08:19.140
Oh

08:47.140 --> 08:54.140
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up.

09:17.140 --> 09:22.140
It's on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:22.140 --> 09:24.140
Hello, we are back live.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

09:26.140 --> 09:27.140
Dave's in the house.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.140
What's up?

09:28.140 --> 09:29.140
He's color-coordinated.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.140
What's up?

09:30.140 --> 09:31.140
Yeah, I wear blue now.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.140
That's all I wear.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.140
You're so coordinated today.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.140
A happy Hanukkah to you, Dave.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.140
Yeah, I got Max USA.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.140
Woot woot!

09:38.140 --> 09:39.140
Woot woot!

09:39.140 --> 09:42.140
Dave, by the way, is also our resident Jew.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.140
Congratulations.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.140
No, you gotta love the Jewish people, though.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.780
I've never met a mean Jewish person.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.780
Every Jewish person I've ever met has been completely nice.

09:51.780 --> 09:54.580
Dave kind of borderline, but you know, good enough.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.580
My grandmother.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.620
No, I do like this color coordination thing you have going though, very nice.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.660
You know, you're just playing that promo, the catch-up song promo, and I was thinking

10:03.660 --> 10:07.180
Dave's the only person I know that actually knows the dance.

10:07.180 --> 10:10.420
And I wish I'd known the other night when they were playing it at the club.

10:10.420 --> 10:11.420
I don't know the dance.

10:11.420 --> 10:16.880
I saw the five second video of them doing like the I don't know the chimichanga dance or whatever. It's called

10:18.420 --> 10:23.260
Yeah, that's where you lay on your back and wave your hands in the feet and you're like a dead cockroach

10:27.380 --> 10:33.000
But the reason why I'm late is because are we just being totally random tonight, why are you tardy sir?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.940
Well, I figured you're just getting used to the 630 thing. This is only like what the third show

10:36.940 --> 10:42.980
we've been starting 6-3? Actually, I remember at about 4 o'clock, I'm like, okay, well,

10:42.980 --> 10:47.900
I just borrowed Kingdom Hearts from my friend JJ, so I think I'll go play the Hades Cup

10:47.900 --> 10:54.740
now, which is 50 battles long, including at least five bosses. So I started that, I'm

10:54.740 --> 10:58.820
not exactly sure when, because I had to level up a little bit, and then I finally finished,

10:58.820 --> 11:05.500
I beat everyone, and I finished like ten minutes ago, and then I ran down and came over here.

11:05.500 --> 11:09.500
Well, I suppose if we're going to get cast aside for Kingdom Hearts, there's not a lot we can do.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
Animal Crossing stole me from Kingdom Hearts.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.500
That's right. Animal Crossing, by the way, is in the other room right now, and that's where Brad and Irene...

11:14.500 --> 11:18.500
They just came in in the beginning to say hello, and now they're back out there. They'll be back for Listless later on the show, but...

11:18.500 --> 11:22.500
I'm going to have to start playing Kingdom Hearts again, because I'm only in Agrabah.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
I'm way over-leveled for where I am.

11:24.500 --> 11:32.500
Being suggested in the chat room, apparently EOSFBB has this bookmarked, the link to the catch-up song video.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
Because he sure was able to find that pretty fast.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.500
So, he wants us to watch that live on air, but unfortunately, I can't do that.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
I don't want to vomit on the microphone.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
Yeah, we don't want to get Jamie to vomit on the microphone.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.500
Also, if I try to watch streaming video, it eats up a lot of my resources,

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
which means listeners get kicked from the live stream, and we don't want that to happen.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
But, we'll do that another time.

11:50.500 --> 11:56.500
He says he wants to thank whoever made that video, so I'm assuming there's a lot of cleavage in the boob shots.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Cleavage-ay.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
Anyway.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
Yeah, let's hear it for tits.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.500
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.500
As I say it, I'm a flat monotone.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.500
Okay, we apologize also if you're hearing a hum in the background tonight.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
We don't know what's causing it.

12:16.500 --> 12:25.500
We're trying in studio here to take measures to not have it happen, but it's still happening we think, so just bear with us tonight please.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
Yes, just pretend we're all doing yoga.

12:29.500 --> 12:35.500
It's the incessant noise of Homer after he's like, mmm, doughnut.

12:35.500 --> 12:40.500
Beer, 72 ounce tub of beer.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.500
You know they sell these huge, huge, big old things at 7-Eleven now.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.500
It's like, gotta be like a hundred and thirteen ounces.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
The bucket.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.500
The bucket.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
The super bucket.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
You didn't see the bucket that I bought, Dan, at Great America.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
What's that?

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
We were there to see Margaret Cho.

12:53.500 --> 13:00.500
I bought this 100 and something ounce bucket, drink bucket for Dan.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.500
Oh, I do remember seeing that. Yes, it was for his coffee.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
Mm-hmm. No, just for him to drink.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
Well, just for him to drink. For orange soda.

13:07.500 --> 13:13.500
You know, the 7-Eleven's having a special right now. You can fill up any mug for 79 cents full of coffee.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.500
Dude, I'll do that. I'll bring that thing and fill it up full of coffee and take it to work.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
You should make your ghetto mochas.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
Dude, my ghetto mochas own.

13:21.500 --> 13:30.980
The Get-A-Mocha, you take really strong coffee, and then you put in Swiss Miss chocolate mix.

13:30.980 --> 13:38.820
Add in a tablespoon of hazelnut creamer, and then like half a spoonful of sugar.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.980
Mix that up, add more coffee to mix everything else up, and then drink it.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.980
You'll be awake all day for the next week.

13:45.980 --> 13:49.820
Oh, you're going to go get sucked in Animal Crossing 2 as well.

13:49.820 --> 13:53.820
I've heard so much about it, how can I resist?

13:53.820 --> 13:54.820
Fine, fine.

13:54.820 --> 13:59.820
You didn't even eat my nuts.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.020
Oh, now Bradley's here.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.820
Dang, is there a party going on at the house today that I don't know about apparently?

14:03.820 --> 14:04.820
There's a party at the house and everyone's invited.

14:04.820 --> 14:05.820
Alright, let's say hello to Bradley.

14:05.820 --> 14:06.820
How you doing Bradley?

14:06.820 --> 14:07.820
I'm doing okay.

14:07.820 --> 14:11.420
You just ran over here, you were in the chat room in the exit and now here you are.

14:11.420 --> 14:14.820
Now you came to finally get your 2DX controller this week, right?

14:14.820 --> 14:15.820
Yes.

14:15.820 --> 14:16.820
Let's upgrade again.

14:16.820 --> 14:17.820
I'll come back again.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.620
I swear I haven't played it at all.

14:19.620 --> 14:24.780
Well, obviously we have Animal Crossing now, so we got sucked into that, so there's no

14:24.780 --> 14:27.620
use for my Playstation anymore because we've got Animal Crossing.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.700
Scroop Imani, this is now a show all about Animal Crossing.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.420
Oh my god, that Mallory.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.700
It's the I hate Mallory show.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.340
I like Mallory.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.340
Just kidding, just kidding.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.340
Mallory gives me stuff.

14:38.340 --> 14:41.900
Well, you hear that Olivia is the troublemaker in our town, who moved from your town.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.540
I don't want Olivia back.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.540
You're abusing Olivia.

14:45.540 --> 14:53.060
I do have to say also though, of course, a big, big thank you to Loki, because Loki spent

14:53.060 --> 14:57.780
some bonus money on spreading a little joy in the household of Rob this week.

14:57.780 --> 15:05.140
Yeah, he created a, I don't know, a whole troupe of zombies playing that game.

15:05.140 --> 15:08.900
Yeah, Zombie would be right, because Neil was up at about three last morning still playing

15:08.900 --> 15:11.940
it, yesterday morning still playing it.

15:11.940 --> 15:18.940
the

15:22.740 --> 15:27.200
let's start the show off tonight by visiting the old mail bag if you want to

15:27.200 --> 15:33.460
send us an email i gotta do is email orange lounge radio at yahoo dot com

15:33.460 --> 15:36.700
and so right now we're gonna open up the mail bag and take a look

15:36.700 --> 15:39.280
because we've got some mail this week we

15:39.280 --> 15:42.880
Let's see, going into the mail bag, orangelaunchradio.yahoo.com.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.200
Oh, look, one new message.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.280
Hey, that's one more email that we had last week.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.120
Yes, and I feel so special.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.440
All right.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.040
We have an email from, let me see if there's a handle here.

15:56.040 --> 15:56.640
No, there isn't.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.560
So we have an email from Martin.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.240
And Martin emailed us, and he has some questions.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.920
There's a few questions he'd like to ask us here in the studio.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.280
So I thought we'd go down and we'd answer his questions,

16:07.280 --> 16:10.280
because we're nice, we're open people here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
We'll each give it an answer.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.280
We'll each give these questions an answer, and it's a good time filler.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.280
So, question number one from Martin's email.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.280
He wants to know...

16:17.280 --> 16:20.280
I would assume this is specifically for Jamie.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
What are you on?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.280
Happy Crack.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.280
Also known as Propel.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.280
Propel? You're on Propel.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.280
Loki, what are you on?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
I'm not on anything.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.280
I just like this.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
I'm high on life.

16:36.280 --> 16:41.280
I'm on God. No, I'm just kidding.

16:41.280 --> 16:46.280
Okay, not that there's anything wrong with that.

16:46.280 --> 16:51.280
If all goes well later, I'll be on a stranger's bed.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.280
No, uh, just kidding, just kidding.

16:56.280 --> 17:01.280
Two, uh, question number two.

17:01.280 --> 17:12.280
Question 2 for Martin. Can he have some?

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
Sure, go to Walgreens.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.280
Go to Walgreens and get some Propel.

17:17.280 --> 17:25.280
As we discussed, I'm not on anything, so to have...no. You can't.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.280
You can't have any of me. I'm too good for you.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.320
And unfortunately you can't have any of my life. You can probably get some man porn if

17:33.320 --> 17:35.320
you go down to your local video store.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.960
Rob, are you running out of time? Do you need a time transplant?

17:38.960 --> 17:44.360
Yes. I need to go back to high school. I missed out on so much.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.920
Okay, you know what? Martin, if you send us your address, we will send you some Orange

17:48.920 --> 17:51.480
Propel, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio. How's that sound?

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
Okay.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.880
Alright, we'll send some Orange Propel so he can have some of what Jamie's on.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.880
But I usually drink the berry flavor.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.880
The orange flavor sort of tastes like a weak tang.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.880
Ho ho ho.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.880
You are!

18:15.880 --> 18:19.880
Yeah, give us your address and we'll send you flavored water.

18:19.880 --> 18:26.880
up

18:27.480 --> 18:31.280
the

18:31.280 --> 18:35.520
nation

18:35.520 --> 18:38.120
your disgusting

18:38.120 --> 18:42.360
alright question number three why does the chat room not work on my fucking

18:42.360 --> 18:43.000
computer

18:43.000 --> 18:45.320
this year

18:45.320 --> 18:46.940
Let me guess, you're using a Mac.

18:46.940 --> 18:51.580
Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing. You must be using a Mac.

18:51.580 --> 18:56.100
I know it's a little difficult, and you might get it confused with a toaster.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.780
Now, here's how you can tell.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.940
Can you put toast in it?

18:59.940 --> 19:03.140
Does it make bagels?

19:03.140 --> 19:04.980
If it does those two things,

19:04.980 --> 19:11.500
that's kind of difficult. You might need to, you know, actually get a computer expert to determine whether it's a toaster or a Mac, so...

19:11.500 --> 19:16.500
Good luck there. I only said that to piss off BlackWap, because I know he's listening right now.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
We love you, BlackWap!

19:18.500 --> 19:26.500
BlackWap, by the way, is a big Mac fan, so we occasionally knock on the Macs to piss him off.

19:26.500 --> 19:31.500
And if SharksGirl's listening, she's a Mac whore, too. She's a Macette.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.500
We like her Mac, because her Mac is shiny.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
And special reverse CDs for her.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.460
That's true.

19:39.460 --> 19:42.820
The best thing I can suggest is use the Java chat room.

19:42.820 --> 19:48.420
All you have to do is you go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and then you're going

19:48.420 --> 19:53.020
to just click on the chat page and then at the very bottom it will say, if all these

19:53.020 --> 19:56.060
steps don't work, try our Java applet.

19:56.060 --> 20:01.260
And I have to give thanks to Twen because he helped us get this Java applet working,

20:01.260 --> 20:03.460
this handy little thing.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.460
And that should work.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.460
computer can view complex websites, you can run Java, you can get in the chat through

20:08.460 --> 20:13.580
that method. So good luck, and we hope to see you in the chat room tonight.

20:13.580 --> 20:18.420
Question number four from Martin, we're going through the email in our email bag at orangelionsradio.yahoo.com

20:18.420 --> 20:22.660
right now. Question number four is, how the hell did you know so much about the money?

20:22.660 --> 20:25.540
Well. Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is

20:25.540 --> 20:28.540
the part where we get to inflate our egos a little bit talking about how old school

20:28.540 --> 20:32.820
we are, Jamie. Gee, don't start on me or anything.

20:32.820 --> 20:35.820
Do you want to go new school-ist to old school-ist?

20:35.820 --> 20:36.820
Well, I can start.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.820
Alright, Jamie's the most old school in the room.

20:39.820 --> 20:41.820
Alright, let's see.

20:41.820 --> 20:44.820
Not last year, year before.

20:44.820 --> 20:49.820
Because I first played on the DDR machine at AX 2000, I think it was.

20:49.820 --> 20:50.820
Okay.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.820
Bradley was there, that's where I met Bradley.

20:52.820 --> 20:53.820
On the AX 2000?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.820
Yeah, I started playing in February of that year.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.820
Actually, I had seen DDR the year before that.

20:59.820 --> 21:07.820
I was in a best-to-move tournament, best-to-move 2, just trashing everybody until I got a faulty controller.

21:07.820 --> 21:14.820
So it was in July of 1999 that I first saw DDR and I looked over and I was like,

21:14.820 --> 21:23.820
that game looks stupid, until I heard someone playing Kung Fu Fighting.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.820
And I was like, hey, it's Kung Fu Fighting, that's pretty cool.

21:26.820 --> 21:33.820
I went over and looked at it like, oh, and then I played DDR for the first time in February, and my friend loaned me his Playstation version and the dance pad.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.820
I'm really crappy, you're a funny one too, but I digress.

21:36.820 --> 21:50.820
So, I was like, this DDR thing is cool, and then I came home from work one day in April, my birthday, and there was our Dreamcast set out with one of the nice dance pads and my own DDR second mix.

21:50.820 --> 21:56.820
So I was happy. I first played the machine in July of 2000 at the Anime Expo.

21:56.820 --> 21:59.820
I paid $2 a game. I slept in the damn room.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.820
Just watching people. I was like, oh man, that's cool.

22:02.820 --> 22:05.820
I remember being in there and seeing Xanadu because I liked the movie.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.820
And I liked Olivia Newton-John.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.820
And people were going, I thought you never played DDR before.

22:10.820 --> 22:13.820
But I like, this was a movie? Hello?

22:13.820 --> 22:17.820
Olivia Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra? Are you that young?

22:17.820 --> 22:23.820
So, and that's how it went from there, September-ish, no, maybe August or so.

22:23.820 --> 22:29.820
Kojiko Lanes got their DDR 1.5 and that started it.

22:29.820 --> 22:33.820
Right on. So, and just you've become such an addict over time that that's how you know.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.820
So much about money.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.820
Yeah, I just kept finding more and more stuff that I like.

22:37.820 --> 22:40.820
Sounds good. My story, I'll try to keep it brief.

22:40.820 --> 22:41.820
Well, there's one other thing.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.820
Oh, yeah, sorry.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.820
I have this, you know, addiction to owning controllers.

22:46.820 --> 22:53.820
So, oooh, we need my money again, I have to get a controller for it!

22:53.820 --> 22:57.820
Alright, how the hell did I discover my money?

22:57.820 --> 23:01.820
It was over Memorial Day in 2000, I think?

23:01.820 --> 23:03.820
Couple years ago, it was a couple years ago.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.820
Actually, maybe it was 99, actually, come to think of it.

23:06.820 --> 23:11.820
I don't remember, but it was Memorial Day some year, I went and I actually went to Milpitas Golf Land.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.820
And I think they were having a tournament because there were a lot of people there.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.600
lot of people there. Now keep in mind I knew nothing about, we were actually going there

23:17.600 --> 23:21.920
to golf. I knew nothing about DDR or anything. I saw the game, thought it was cool. No chance

23:21.920 --> 23:25.920
in hell I was going to be playing because there was way too crowded around the machine.

23:25.920 --> 23:30.340
But I actually ended up seeing the machine months later at a 25th anniversary Rocky Horror

23:30.340 --> 23:35.960
convention in October of 2000 and that's when I played for the first time. And a couple

23:35.960 --> 23:41.520
friends from the Rocky cast, including Rice Princesses out in the other room, we skipped

23:41.520 --> 23:46.360
out on the convention Friday night and we stayed up and played DDR and it was so much

23:46.360 --> 23:55.040
fun. So that's when I got hooked on DDR. And after that, let's see, I started playing when

23:55.040 --> 24:00.520
Roswell Golf Land got USA mixed in something like, what, January? I don't know. So I started

24:00.520 --> 24:04.360
playing, no it was December, December of two years ago. I met you at Milpitas Golf Land.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.680
Yeah, so it's coming up, yeah it's coming up two years. So two years I've been playing

24:07.680 --> 24:14.140
I'm a sponge, I pick up every piece of information I hear.

24:14.140 --> 24:19.320
As far as the radio thing goes, I used to have my own college radio show for seven semesters

24:19.320 --> 24:22.680
back when I went to Chico State, so that's kind of where I picked up the radio thing.

24:22.680 --> 24:28.100
And then I was co-hosting a program called Understation Live up until a couple months

24:28.100 --> 24:35.780
ago when our head host Travis had to leave, took off for Texas and just kind of been doing

24:35.780 --> 24:40.500
the radio thing ever since. Orange Lounge is, I guess at its core, Orange Lounge is

24:40.500 --> 24:44.500
somewhat of a spin-off of that show, but I don't know. I don't know what you want to

24:44.500 --> 24:45.500
call it.

24:45.500 --> 24:49.300
Lowkey, your turn. You're the most new school, and this is kind of sad, because I know you've

24:49.300 --> 24:52.020
been playing DDR at least a year, so that doesn't make you that new school.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.340
It's actually been like two years.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.340
Oh, wow.

24:54.340 --> 25:05.340
I started, I think it was, I'd say, maybe April of 2001? Yeah, April of 2001, so it's almost been two years.

25:05.340 --> 25:16.340
And I started, I saw it first at Phantom of a Con that year, 2001, saw it there, and I actually got to try it out on...

25:16.340 --> 25:21.340
I saw you there. I knew I saw you at Pawnee. I was dressed up as Emmy.

25:21.340 --> 25:24.340
How would I remember it? I don't know.

25:24.340 --> 25:27.340
He was drunk.

25:27.340 --> 25:29.340
He was trying to get hookers.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.340
I wasn't trying to get hookers.

25:31.340 --> 25:36.340
Well, if you tuned into last week or the week before that, you would have already known that that's happened.

25:36.340 --> 25:38.340
I mean, sort of.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.340
No, he was chasing the Jiggly Slut around.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.340
The Jiggly Slut.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.340
The Jiggly Puff Cosplay Girl.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.340
No, they...

25:44.340 --> 25:46.340
No, I remember...

25:46.340 --> 25:47.340
Well, no, that one.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.340
Last year.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.340
Last year we were chasing around a bunch of women with cameras, but no.

25:53.340 --> 26:01.340
Anyways, so I saw a DDR fourth mix there, and then I got to try a USA machine in Tahoe and had no rhythm whatsoever, so that was fun.

26:01.340 --> 26:13.340
And so then I went and I guess I found out that it was at Sunsplash or RVGL, and so I went and played down there ever since the other fourth in their USA machine.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.340
I bought the home versions and that kind of thing.

26:15.340 --> 26:26.340
And then ever since that, because I used to be really into QZAR, and you know, the laser tech place up here, and I played it for like four years, I was really obsessed with it, well then that went away.

26:26.340 --> 26:43.340
And so now, now I guess I'm just, you know, into DDR, and how I know a lot of stuff about Bimani is that at my work, during phone calls and stuff, I'm actually browsing the Bimani news sites out there, and you know, that's how I know pretty much everything goes on.

26:43.340 --> 26:49.740
So I read about 12 different message boards all day long.

26:49.740 --> 26:50.340
Right on.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.340
So that's the answer to that question.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.180
Boy, that was a long answer.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.660
But hey, we've got a lot to say here on Orange Lounge Radio.

26:56.660 --> 26:59.460
If you're just joining us, as I know some people have just

26:59.460 --> 27:02.020
joined us, we are answering email right now.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.300
If you have a question, a comment,

27:04.300 --> 27:06.140
something you'd like to say, we will read it

27:06.140 --> 27:07.060
in our mailbag segment.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.980
Just send us an email, OrangeLoungeRadio,

27:08.980 --> 27:11.940
all one word, at yahoo.com.

27:11.940 --> 27:16.940
and we're reading an email from Martin right now, and he asked a bunch of questions, so we're answering them right now.

27:16.940 --> 27:20.940
Question number five, is it only me, or do the Zippers suck?

27:20.940 --> 27:28.940
The Zippers, by the way, being that band that JB brought in last night, or, I'm sorry, last week with the CD.

27:28.940 --> 27:33.940
I'm not a huge fan of the Zippers. In fact, I don't like them pretty much at all.

27:33.940 --> 27:38.940
But, yeah, they kind of suck if you don't like that speed type music thing.

27:38.940 --> 27:48.940
I don't know, that's kind of a trend that DDR has, you know, putting a lot of speed mixes and Euromix and stuff, so if you're just not into it, I guess that you wouldn't like it, but you know, it's something for someone, I'm sure.

28:18.940 --> 28:22.940
How come everyone I know suddenly has the weasel, aka Bush Baby?

28:22.940 --> 28:30.940
Bush Baby, our second Orange Lounge mascot, our first Orange Lounge mascot would be Dave.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.940
But our second Orange Lounge mascot would be the weasel.

28:33.940 --> 28:36.940
It was given to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.

28:36.940 --> 28:41.940
Simple as that, and it sits here. I have a lot of little thingies that sit above the computer.

28:41.940 --> 28:47.940
There's a Clifford ball, there's a devil I got from that same convention where I saw DDR the first time,

28:47.940 --> 28:51.660
Batsmaru, a bunch of stickers, the cartman doll, things like that, and the ferret was

28:51.660 --> 28:55.900
just sitting up there and Jamie grabbed it one night and just went to town, so you hear

28:55.900 --> 28:58.540
it right now.

28:58.540 --> 29:04.060
So that's the story behind the weasel, and if everyone you know has the weasel, I don't

29:04.060 --> 29:05.980
know your friends, so I don't know why.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.980
It's a ferret, it's a weasel or a ferret, it's a thingy.

29:08.980 --> 29:13.020
Next question, how did you find out about DER top hits or mis-hits?

29:13.020 --> 29:16.580
I signed on to Sac Bay Monty one day and there it was, the end.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.060
low-key told me so i have told

29:19.060 --> 29:22.720
uh... is actually here in japan they were on their message boards they were

29:22.720 --> 29:25.580
doing a uh...

29:25.580 --> 29:29.740
the money knock-offs it's been off that i think and i haven't been the person

29:29.740 --> 29:31.980
they're talking about the air topics

29:31.980 --> 29:35.660
uh... same group did another one uh... it is so a lot of great

29:35.660 --> 29:37.420
to fit

29:37.420 --> 29:41.780
the same people that did that one

29:41.780 --> 29:46.460
so uh... yeah aaron in japan dot com very fine website we like them so

29:46.460 --> 29:49.000
visit them.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Next question.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.160
Did I get your email address right?

29:51.160 --> 29:53.100
Well, of course you did because we're reading your email right now.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.380
It is OrangeLoungeRadial, all in a word, at yahoo.com and says, Loki, email me back if

29:57.380 --> 29:58.380
you did.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.900
So I'll forward this email to Loki and you two can talk about whatever you guys need

30:01.900 --> 30:02.900
to talk about.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.900
I don't know.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.900
Oh, maybe he wants a date.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.260
Oh, no, I don't.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.260
We'll see.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.260
All right.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.300
So thanks so much for the email, Marvin.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.300
We appreciate it.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.740
And I think he just joined the chat room.

30:13.740 --> 30:17.740
I see a new name here that matches the one on the email, so who knows?

30:17.740 --> 30:20.740
Oh, we just got one more new message. Let's have a look.

30:20.740 --> 30:26.740
Oh, we got an email from Black Lab. Oh, it says FUs of the Week. Well, we've got to save those for later.

30:26.740 --> 30:29.740
Never mind. We'll read those later. Those are the FUs of the Week.

30:29.740 --> 30:34.740
Okay. Oh, I'd like to say an early happy birthday to DDR Angel.

30:34.740 --> 30:40.740
That's somebody new that just started chatting in our chat room this week, and she's having a birthday on Wednesday.

30:40.740 --> 30:46.340
And she would love it if you came out to Scandia in Rohnert Park and played some DDR with her

30:46.340 --> 30:47.340
for her birthday.

30:47.340 --> 30:50.460
I was going to try to make it out there, but I don't know how flexible it is with my work.

30:50.460 --> 30:51.780
Yeah, it's a little ways to go.

30:51.780 --> 30:52.780
Yeah.

30:52.780 --> 30:54.620
Oh, he says, he says yes, it is him.

30:54.620 --> 30:59.420
And also, another early happy birthday wish to one of our, we have a new school listener

30:59.420 --> 31:03.820
and a very, very old school listener, been here with us, I believe, since the first show,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.980
did our website, SoCalKicks is having a birthday tomorrow.

31:06.980 --> 31:07.980
Woohoo!

31:07.980 --> 31:08.980
Happy birthday to him.

31:08.980 --> 31:09.980
Squeeze.

31:09.980 --> 31:13.980
Oh, I can turn off the music now. We're done with the mailbag.

31:13.980 --> 31:17.980
So a big happy birthday yet, because I have the sound off in the studio to try to get rid of that, huh?

31:17.980 --> 31:21.980
I don't know. We'll see.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.980
So, speaking of

31:25.980 --> 31:29.980
SoCal Kicks, I believe I can talk about this now, yeah? I don't know.

31:29.980 --> 31:33.980
We're going to see. I'm going to plug some websites. We're going to do some website hunting

31:33.980 --> 31:37.980
right now, because a couple websites have just launched.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.980
There's one right now!

32:07.980 --> 32:15.980
Dude, that game looks so boring. I don't know if there's some underlying secret mind control device, but it's like, okay.

32:15.980 --> 32:18.980
Yes. You talking about Animal Crossing? Yes. It's addicting as hell.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.980
It's like, okay, I need to go change the music now.

32:21.980 --> 32:27.980
Did they show you the old-school Nintendo games that you can play? Tell them to go to my house and play the old-school Nintendo games. It's awesome.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.980
Okay, I will.

32:29.980 --> 32:31.980
Do you want to comment on Animal Crossing?

32:31.980 --> 32:32.980
No, I was saying yes.

32:32.980 --> 32:33.980
Oh, okay.

32:33.980 --> 32:35.980
Oh yes, back to SoCalKicks.com.

32:35.980 --> 32:41.980
Blah, blah, blah. Welcome back to SDK Max Ultimate Evolution just now.

32:41.980 --> 32:45.980
About time after a three week wait, and constant launch dates being flushed right down the drain.

32:45.980 --> 32:51.980
Finally the site relaunches, just in time for SoCalKicks' birthday.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.980
Happy birthday.

32:53.980 --> 32:59.980
He's got a lot of people on board, gonna be doing the website stuff, and none of us are on it.

32:59.980 --> 33:12.500
Oh, but he says it is in no way the final staff list, so maybe we can, you know, turn

33:12.500 --> 33:14.300
some tricks and get listed.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.720
He wants more people on his staff.

33:16.720 --> 33:22.820
He wants more people to get on his staff.

33:22.820 --> 33:26.740
Let's see, so what's so big about SDK Max 5.0 that makes it better than the other versions?

33:26.740 --> 33:33.740
says

34:26.740 --> 34:27.740
Did Jamie leave?

34:27.740 --> 34:28.740
She left.

34:28.740 --> 34:29.740
Oh, my bad.

34:29.740 --> 34:31.580
Okay, we'll take a really quick break, and then after this break, we're going to peruse

34:31.580 --> 34:34.060
another website that we've been asked to whore out tonight.

34:34.060 --> 34:37.360
So we will be right back after this very quick break.

34:37.360 --> 34:42.200
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll be right back to talk about all

34:42.200 --> 34:49.200
things but money. And then some. See ya!

35:12.200 --> 35:14.200
We're gonna fight for life

35:15.200 --> 35:17.200
Baby fight to the right

35:19.200 --> 35:21.200
We're gonna move tonight

35:23.200 --> 35:25.200
Let's move tonight

35:26.200 --> 35:28.200
Yeah we'll fight to the right

35:30.200 --> 35:32.200
Baby fight to the right

35:33.200 --> 35:35.200
We're gonna move tonight

35:35.200 --> 35:42.200
Let's just go Alright

35:42.200 --> 35:52.200
Let's just go Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
Let's just go Have a good time

35:56.200 --> 36:00.520
All right, all right, all right

36:00.520 --> 36:04.280
Let them go, they should stand up

36:04.280 --> 36:07.640
All right, all right

36:12.520 --> 36:14.920
One, two, three, two, one

37:14.920 --> 37:42.520
Hello, you are

37:42.520 --> 37:46.860
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and that was three to one stars which is going to be

37:46.860 --> 37:47.860
in DDR Extreme.

37:47.860 --> 37:48.860
It's delicious.

37:48.860 --> 37:54.040
It's extremely an old Bimani song but it'll be in DDR Extreme and I always said that should

37:54.040 --> 37:55.980
be in DDR because it's fun.

37:55.980 --> 38:00.340
Before that, by request, Let's Groove coming to us from the chat room and if you want to

38:00.340 --> 38:06.620
join our chat room just go to our website orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.400
It's just that simple.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.580
Another quick announcement, I don't think we announced this last break, I want to state

38:11.580 --> 38:17.080
for all you guys. Next week's show, next Sunday's show, I'm actually not going to be here, so

38:17.080 --> 38:21.640
what we're going to do is we're going to tape the show on Saturday night. It's still going

38:21.640 --> 38:26.120
to be in the house, so if you want to tune in at 6.30 next Saturday, you'll hear the

38:26.120 --> 38:31.400
show live. But for those of you that can't make it on Saturday night, we'll rebroadcast

38:31.400 --> 38:38.400
at the normal time on Sunday. Yes, I'm going to see, I'm going to the Cher concert. See

38:38.400 --> 38:45.400
See what I'm really wanting to go see, though? Cindy Lauper's opening, and she's just fucking fabulous, so I can't wait to go.

38:45.400 --> 38:53.400
So, um, we will be taped next week. But if you want to hear it live, we'll be doing the normal shtick just on Saturday night as opposed to Sunday.

38:53.400 --> 39:00.400
So, outside of that, um, oh yes, we're going to be also doing a mini-marathon next week.

39:00.400 --> 39:06.400
So if you want to catch up on some old episodes of Orange Islands Radio, we're going to be marathoning all of season one next weekend.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.400
All of it. So, tune in for that.

39:09.400 --> 39:13.400
Actually, this is something that you and I have discussed, and I forgot to mention it before the show.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
Yes, that's fine.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.400
I talked to you before about a friend of mine who's doing a radio drama.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
Yes! Talk about this. Talk about this.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.400
It's called Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

39:22.400 --> 39:28.400
One is actually based on I Feel Sick, which was Debbie's spin-off.

39:28.400 --> 39:33.400
And I'm going to be a voice actor in it. I'm going to be oblivia.

39:33.400 --> 39:43.400
And we still need one more voice actor for this. My friend Michelle is very talented, doing a very good adaptation of the comic.

39:43.400 --> 39:51.400
So we need one more voice actor, so if anyone's interested, send an email to orangelounge.com.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
I'm interested.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.400
Can you sound like a whiny gothic boy?

39:54.400 --> 39:58.400
I can sound whiny. Wait, I sound whiny as it is.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.400
Well, hey, we'll see. You just get me some samples ready.

40:03.400 --> 40:09.400
So it'll be part of that Bamani music and then some. You're going to be hearing some and then some coming to Orange Lawn's radio.

40:09.400 --> 40:15.400
Right, once everything's done, the plan is to air it, you know, during the show.

40:15.400 --> 40:19.400
I want to be Sque when, you know, he gets his appearance.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.400
We'll talk to her about it.

40:22.400 --> 40:28.480
But we're definitely going to be, once everything is, you know, we've got a first episode reported,

40:28.480 --> 40:30.200
it's going to be played right here.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.560
Right on.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.280
So just stay tuned for that.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.720
Keep tabs on our website, we'll always be talking about that.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.720
Speaking of websites, we were taking the website tour just before we went to break.

40:38.720 --> 40:43.360
We visited SoCalKicks.com and now we're going to whore out another website.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.880
Brand new, I'm not sure if this is going to be a blog or what it is, I believe it's a

40:46.880 --> 40:52.320
blog but I'm being asked to whore it out by a chat regular of ours, DCB.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.320
He's a good buddy of the show.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.520
He's going to be doing a tournament in Fremont, a DDR tourney in Fremont in January.

40:58.520 --> 41:03.280
Check the DDR Freak Tournament forums if you want more information on that.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.840
A Fremont tournament in January.

41:04.840 --> 41:10.000
And he's got this website called Killer Pals, which I'm not sure if that's a reference,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.840
that sounds like a reference to something in the 80s, I just don't remember what.

41:13.840 --> 41:18.440
Like wasn't there some Saturday morning show where the club was a killer, the Super Friends?

41:18.440 --> 41:21.400
Am I just getting Super Friends confused with Killer Pals?

41:21.400 --> 41:22.400
I don't know.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.400
You may have been Killer Pals or Tilly Pals, but I don't know.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.400
Yeah, Killer Pals I guess could be the name of a really bad B-movie.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
I don't know.

41:29.400 --> 41:33.320
I'm going to post this link for all y'all in the chat room, but if you aren't in our

41:33.320 --> 41:42.400
chat room, it's just www.radbeats.com slash tilde killer pals.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
That little squiggly thing.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.840
Tilde, it's a tilde.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.980
It's the shift in the upper left thing, yes.

42:20.980 --> 42:27.980
you should keep an eye on. It's pretty. Because they're neat. I only know about half these

42:28.340 --> 42:33.340
people, but they're all neat. The half I do know are neat. They're very well taken care

42:33.340 --> 42:38.900
of and clean. They have good hygiene. So, visit the killer pals, because Bongo demands

42:38.900 --> 42:43.780
it. Yeah. Let's see, oh, 23rd Magus has a comment for you, Jamie. He says he can sound

42:43.780 --> 42:50.780
like a whiny goth boy, because he is.

42:50.780 --> 42:56.460
Do samples of your voice try to sound, you know, do different types of voices and say

42:56.460 --> 42:59.100
different things and email me that.

42:59.100 --> 43:02.260
Meet me later on AIM and I'll get that from you.

43:02.260 --> 43:07.100
Now they're having an argument in the chat room about tilde versus tilde.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.340
Squiggly thing.

43:08.340 --> 43:09.860
Squiggly thing, exactly.

43:09.860 --> 43:12.940
Just go to dictionary.com and look up the words.

43:12.940 --> 43:17.780
hail the squiggly thing. And it will have a pronunciation key there, so you don't have

43:17.780 --> 43:23.740
to actually go into a dictionary or a real one. Okay, so that's our website tour for

43:23.740 --> 43:28.580
the week. I don't know, is there any other website news that you know of, things going

43:28.580 --> 43:36.940
on? Loki, any big websites that have been renovated? Mergers, buyouts, sellouts, downtimes?

43:36.940 --> 43:41.980
Other than like the week, couple week old 2DX style going down, I guess they're doing

44:11.980 --> 44:24.980
Okay. But all they really had on that site, the site itself, was just the official, you know, Bomani tracks, so you can find those everywhere anyway, so it's kind of useless. But they really had a cool link section that I kind of missed.

44:24.980 --> 44:35.980
Let me make one quick interruption. Michelle, I see you, and yes I did whore out the show. We are going to have that last voice actor.

44:35.980 --> 44:36.980
Okay, cool.

44:36.980 --> 44:37.980
That's all right.

44:37.980 --> 44:38.980
You surrounded us.

44:38.980 --> 44:39.980
Gonna like be brought to you.

44:39.980 --> 44:40.980
Oh, ass!

44:40.980 --> 44:44.580
Sorry to interrupt, Loki, but that's what we do.

44:44.580 --> 44:45.580
That's pretty much it.

44:45.580 --> 44:49.300
Not that I'll be renovating my site at some point when I feel like it.

44:49.300 --> 44:52.500
I haven't felt like it, so...yeah.

44:52.500 --> 45:00.700
Uh, Leech from Loki TK will soon be hosting some Sky Original StepMania files.

45:00.700 --> 45:01.700
Yeah.

45:01.700 --> 45:04.600
They will be scary indeed, so keep an eye out for them.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.600
And I...

45:05.600 --> 45:10.700
I also have to mention that I did change my tourney mix 3 song and you'll be hearing that

45:10.700 --> 45:11.700
later on in the show.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.900
Yes, we'll be doing that in the cage match later.

45:13.900 --> 45:14.900
Cage match is coming up.

45:14.900 --> 45:16.540
I'm so glad we have a crowded chat room tonight.

45:16.540 --> 45:17.540
That makes me a happy bunny.

45:17.540 --> 45:18.540
Oh, hello Elena!

45:18.540 --> 45:19.540
Oh, yes!

45:19.540 --> 45:21.200
I wanted to get to this.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
You have to go soon, huh?

45:22.200 --> 45:24.180
Oh, well I wanted to talk to Elena.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.940
Everybody say hello to Elena.

45:25.940 --> 45:26.940
Hello!

45:26.940 --> 45:27.940
Hello!

45:27.940 --> 45:31.180
Now for those that don't know Elena, which would be everybody, well not in this room.

45:31.180 --> 45:33.780
We all know Elena because we saw her before the show started.

45:33.780 --> 45:35.500
Elena is a friend of mine, she's a buddy of mine.

45:35.500 --> 45:57.060
You know me before I got into DDR, and I was still a nerd back then, too, right?

45:57.060 --> 45:58.060
Oh yeah, completely.

45:58.060 --> 46:01.700
What I want to talk to you about is, because I like to bring strangers on the show occasionally

46:01.700 --> 46:06.760
that know nothing about DDR, just ask you, what do you think when you see this for the

46:06.760 --> 46:11.320
first time, this DDR Fanatic Fan Club?

46:11.320 --> 46:12.860
Are we crazy, or what is it?

46:12.860 --> 46:14.060
You know what, frankly you scare me.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.060
Will we scare you?

46:15.060 --> 46:16.060
How do we scare you?

46:16.060 --> 46:17.060
Oh, I don't know.

46:17.060 --> 46:20.200
It's just all the dancing and all the weird things you guys do.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.200
All the weird things?

46:21.200 --> 46:22.200
Like what?

46:22.200 --> 46:23.200
Handplants and bar raping?

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
Yeah.

46:24.200 --> 46:34.200
I see some of the stuff that you guys, the dance moves and stuff, it's kind of weird.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.840
It's weird in a good way, I should say.

46:37.840 --> 46:42.560
But what I did want to talk to Alaina about is that she just discovered the world of PlayStation

46:42.560 --> 46:43.920
2, what, two weeks ago?

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
How did this happen?

46:44.920 --> 46:51.920
Actually, my roommate's boyfriend, Mike, brought over a PlayStation, and this is really a big

46:51.920 --> 46:55.920
It's a big upgrade for us over at my roommates in my house.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.920
We have the original Atari.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.920
We have been playing it actually.

46:59.920 --> 47:00.920
The original.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.920
We play Space Invaders and all the fun stuff.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.920
I wanted to ask you about Atari 2600.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.920
You've been playing Atari 2600.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.920
Up until two weeks ago, it was all about fucking Atari.

47:10.920 --> 47:11.920
It was great.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.920
What is the best Atari 2600 game you've ever played in your whole life?

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
Space Invaders.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.920
Space Invaders?

47:16.920 --> 47:17.920
I just love it.

47:17.920 --> 47:18.920
I disagree.

47:18.920 --> 47:19.920
I disagree.

47:19.920 --> 47:20.920
Break out.

47:20.920 --> 47:25.080
kaboom kaboom kaboom is the best kangaroo

47:25.080 --> 47:28.840
no i didn't like kangaroo at all but you know what i have a 5200 and it's all

47:28.840 --> 47:32.600
about kicks see we can't even get that game it's all

47:32.600 --> 47:37.960
about a large group of drunk people playing combat no

47:37.960 --> 47:42.520
okay i'm being i'm being yelled at in the chat room because atari 2600 is not

47:42.520 --> 47:46.760
the original atari it's the only atari that matters so

47:46.760 --> 47:53.760
There was the Pong system, and there was some other one that was like a maze one.

47:53.760 --> 47:54.760
Yeah, but this is...

47:54.760 --> 48:00.760
Yeah, but as far as conventional systems go, the Atari 2600 is probably the granddaddy,

48:00.760 --> 48:03.760
unless you count the Fairchild Channel left that came out before it.

48:03.760 --> 48:06.760
You don't even play Game Boy?

48:06.760 --> 48:09.760
No, actually, I haven't ever played Game Boy.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
You haven't ever played Game Boy?

48:10.760 --> 48:11.760
Never.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.760
So, you just don't think you can get into the DDR?

48:13.760 --> 48:17.760
Did you see the turntable game? The 2DX? The turntable game with the buttons?

48:17.760 --> 48:18.760
No.

48:18.760 --> 48:23.760
No? Is it just intimidating? What frighted you about DDR?

48:23.760 --> 48:28.760
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's just because I'm a pretty busy person and I just don't know how to play.

48:28.760 --> 48:32.760
Oh! Oh, I see. You don't got no time for DDR. Oh, mm-hmm.

48:32.760 --> 48:36.760
Busy Elena. She got time to be doing the Space Invaders.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.760
But heaven forbid you asked her to dance a little.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.760
Now, Space Invaders is an awfully good drunk party game, so just don't ignore it.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.760
Well, so is DDR.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.760
Well...

48:44.760 --> 48:46.760
You've been to the house parties, you know.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.760
Yes, I do.

48:47.760 --> 48:50.760
I can play 2DX drunk and do pretty good.

48:50.760 --> 48:55.760
But you know what, it's not only just DDR that is a little Ina Strange.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.760
I can do a party that you were at.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.760
You guys were playing something with...

49:00.760 --> 49:02.760
Yes, Parapara.

49:02.760 --> 49:06.760
Oh, Parapara scares even us, so it's okay.

49:06.760 --> 49:10.760
Oh, we got Ryan to wear Ena's clothing. That was great.

49:10.760 --> 49:16.760
We got one of our friends, Ryan, SDMX, he actually wore his girlfriend's clothes and played Para Para.

49:16.760 --> 49:21.760
Pictures were taken of this and put on other websites, yes.

49:21.760 --> 49:24.760
That was insane. That was an insane part.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.760
Did we get you to play that? How was Para Para frightening to you?

49:27.760 --> 49:29.760
I wasn't drunk enough.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.760
How was Para Para frightening? I want to know.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.760
Well, first of all, it's not a fish.

49:34.760 --> 49:40.460
Actually, most of the songs are in English and all the texts in the game is, too.

49:40.460 --> 49:41.840
Not the one that you guys had on that night.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.300
The Macarena's in Spanish?

49:44.300 --> 49:46.380
Everybody knows the Macarena?

49:46.380 --> 49:50.020
Yes, got her.

49:50.020 --> 49:55.660
Well, the scary thing I think about Patapata is that when you watch the people who know

49:55.660 --> 50:00.300
the dances, and then you have five people behind them who all know the dances, too.

50:00.300 --> 50:04.920
What was going on when you were here that we were all going, boom, boom, deluxe, da,

50:04.920 --> 50:07.860
da, da, da, da, da, shake my ass, shake my ass.

50:07.860 --> 50:10.580
It was a whole room of people, it was very pretty.

50:10.580 --> 50:16.580
I can totally understand at the MGL tournament too, I think it was, when they were having

50:16.580 --> 50:21.060
that go on, people around the Para Para second mix, I was just walking in the room all of

50:21.060 --> 50:26.300
a sudden you see 30 people doing it, like, holy crap, zombies, run, it's still all over

50:26.300 --> 50:27.300
again.

50:27.300 --> 50:32.580
You know the sad thing about it in Japan and Hawaii and basically all over the area?

50:32.580 --> 50:36.060
The Para Para dance, there's whole clubs of people who do this.

50:36.060 --> 50:39.220
And everybody dresses the same because, you know, it's easier to do Para Para when you

50:39.220 --> 50:41.060
have no sleeves and everything.

50:41.060 --> 50:42.060
Wait a minute.

50:42.060 --> 50:45.140
Because knowing Elena, I know something about Elena that y'all don't know, so I'm coming

50:45.140 --> 50:46.580
in armed.

50:46.580 --> 50:50.100
Elena, don't you do country line dancing?

50:50.100 --> 50:51.100
Oh, no.

50:51.100 --> 50:52.740
Not since there hasn't been a club in Sacramento.

50:52.740 --> 50:54.500
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

50:54.500 --> 50:58.060
How is country line dancing different than Para Para except the music in Para Para is

50:58.060 --> 50:59.060
better?

50:59.060 --> 51:05.060
Well, you know what, I never country line danced without some alcohol in me, so no.

51:05.060 --> 51:06.940
The other thing about Para Para is that...

51:06.940 --> 51:07.940
How's country line dancing?

51:07.940 --> 51:08.940
Say hello to Neil.

51:08.940 --> 51:11.940
That's because with country line dancing you're not doing it alone.

51:11.940 --> 51:12.940
Yes.

51:12.940 --> 51:13.940
You're not looking like a single fool.

51:13.940 --> 51:14.940
You have partners.

51:14.940 --> 51:18.460
And you don't have idiots shadowing behind you.

51:18.460 --> 51:22.460
At actual Para Para clubs, they have everybody doing the same thing with you, it's that everybody

51:22.460 --> 51:23.460
looks like they're all on crack.

51:23.460 --> 51:24.460
You know what that does?

51:24.460 --> 51:27.460
If I took you to a Para Para Club, do you think you could get down and boogie?

51:27.460 --> 51:30.460
You know what, I probably could handle the dance, but I don't think I could.

51:30.460 --> 51:35.460
No offense, you know, I love you.

51:35.460 --> 51:38.460
That was the best thing I've heard all night.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.460
That's so owned.

51:41.460 --> 51:44.460
You get winner points today.

51:44.460 --> 51:46.460
Alaina gets escorted off the show now.

51:46.460 --> 51:47.460
Thank you for being with us tonight, we appreciate it.

51:47.460 --> 51:48.460
Big hugs.

51:48.460 --> 51:49.460
Take care.

51:49.460 --> 51:51.460
Enjoy Gran Turismo.

51:51.460 --> 51:53.460
This is your new addiction, Gran Turismo.

51:53.460 --> 51:57.460
I was on top, man. 247.9 miles an hour.

51:57.460 --> 51:59.460
What car are you using?

51:59.460 --> 52:03.460
R something. You know what, we're going to take you to play Initial D someday.

52:03.460 --> 52:06.460
Yes, we will take you to play Initial D.

52:06.460 --> 52:09.460
This is the only game I have played on these new PlayStations.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.460
I have to learn one before I move on to the next.

52:12.460 --> 52:14.460
You're going to graduate to Initial D next week.

52:14.460 --> 52:17.460
And then maybe some Grand Theft Auto after that. We'll see.

52:17.460 --> 52:19.460
Take care, Elena. Big hand for Elena.

52:19.460 --> 52:21.460
I still need to get Vice City.

52:21.460 --> 52:22.460
And Neil was in there too.

52:22.460 --> 52:26.460
I still need to get Vice City so that I can go around and kill people.

52:26.460 --> 52:28.460
You can get hookers to sleep with you?

52:28.460 --> 52:30.460
I don't want a hooker!

52:30.460 --> 52:34.460
See, the thing is, they don't have, you know, like, mansluts out on the street in my game.

52:34.460 --> 52:36.460
They need to have mansluts.

52:36.460 --> 52:42.460
There needs to be... Okay, you know, they just put out Tokimeki Memorial Girlside, where you can, you know, date the boys.

52:42.460 --> 52:49.460
I want to have GTA chick version, where you can go pick up the mansluts off the street and...

52:49.460 --> 52:51.460
Some man-whores?

52:51.460 --> 52:56.060

52:56.060 --> 53:03.460

that just kidding cause you know if i were really a militant female you know yeah i know

53:20.540 --> 53:22.540
I know you would have had your foot in my ass a long time ago.

53:22.540 --> 53:26.540
You wouldn't be eating nuts, but it wouldn't be the ones I bought at the store.

53:26.540 --> 53:30.540
It'd be after I kicked him into your mouth.

53:30.540 --> 53:35.540
Alright, I think we're going to take a really quick break.

53:35.540 --> 53:37.540
Yeah, Rob doesn't want his nuts kicked.

53:37.540 --> 53:40.540
Yeah, I don't want Jamie to kick my nuts right now.

53:40.540 --> 53:46.540
We're going to take a quick break, we'll be back, and now is the time in the show when you're going to send us your FUs of the week.

53:46.540 --> 54:00.540
We're going to get some private messages in the chat room to Skye, that's me, and they'll have your FUs of the week, so send those now, and we'll read those on the air when we come back.

54:00.540 --> 54:02.540
Let us know what has you really hacked off.

54:02.540 --> 54:10.540
Or, if you're too lazy, you don't want to join our chat room, you want a little bit of anonymity, that's fine, you can send us an email, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.540
That's fine.

54:11.540 --> 54:16.420
You can send us an email, orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com, and if you say, don't say my name on the air,

54:16.420 --> 54:17.420
we won't.

54:17.420 --> 54:18.420
So you can do your anonymous FUs.

54:18.420 --> 54:19.420
Fair enough.

54:19.420 --> 54:20.420
You can be a wimp.

54:20.420 --> 54:23.060
Jamie, would you like to dedicate this first song during the break?

54:23.060 --> 54:25.420
I dedicate this song to me because I love it.

54:25.420 --> 54:26.420
Alright, here we go.

54:26.420 --> 54:54.420
I'm lost inside of me, trapped in a notion Where am I going to?

54:54.420 --> 55:01.420
I need to leave, I need to let go

55:01.420 --> 55:09.420
Of all the friends I've lost inside my life

55:09.420 --> 55:13.420
I'm not a change of mind

55:13.420 --> 55:19.420
How could I find my way to you?

55:19.420 --> 55:28.420
I've been reaching for my love

55:28.420 --> 55:34.420
Forever seeking the secrets of my heart

55:34.420 --> 55:44.420
Reaching for the secrets of my love

55:44.420 --> 55:46.420
Like a child

56:01.420 --> 56:06.420
How can I find my way to you?

58:06.420 --> 58:24.380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

59:54.380 --> 01:00:01.380
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.800
us on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.200
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.020
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me, and you just might realize the

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.300
the best things in life are for you.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:32.300
Hey, it's our buddy Mel B. there, saying hello to all of us and all of you listening to Orange

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.300
Lounge Radio.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.700
We've got to have him back on the show sometime.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.500
He can pull off that tone very well.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500
Yes, he's very smooth.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
Yeah, he's very smooth.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
Yes.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:47.940
Okay, so as promised, it's time to talk about the FUs of the Week.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.460
We can be pissy.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.380
Jamie, why don't you tell us, give us a little background on the FUs of the Week.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.680
This is 22 weeks running now.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680
No longer than that.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680
About 24 weeks running now.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.200
It started with our very first show.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200
Yes.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.920
Because I was feeling particularly angsty one day and wanted to just vent, vent, vent,

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920
vent.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920
Well, guess what?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
You all get to hear it.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.280
Well, anyway, the whole thing with having the FUs of the Week is basically, it is our

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280
time to vent.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.080
These are the things that aggravate us.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.080
We're people.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080
We're human.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.080
We need to get this out of our system or we'll go crazy and we'll take you with us.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080
Anyway.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:27.080
Um, so that's what the F.U.'s the week are for, and eventually the chatroom got as angsty as we did, so we let them in on the fun, too.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:33.080
And you still can, uh, sit in on the fun. If you want to send a share of F.U.'s of the week, you just send those over private message and we'll take care of it.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.080
See, even the stupid ferret has an F.U. of the week.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.080
See?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.080
Are you ready to begin with your F.U. of the week, Jamie?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080
Please do.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080
Let's kick it off!

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080
Cause this is fucked up.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080
Alright.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.080
My, uh, few of the week. I have a few, as usual.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.080
Um, you know, the last few weeks I've been a little bit happier, haven't had too much to bitch about.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.080
Why would I say fuck you to Ragnarok Online?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.080
This is why, okay?

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.080
I've been sitting there for three months waiting for the server to come back up

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.080
so that I could get my character back in my lovely little goggles and be happy

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080
and they're making us pay for it.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.080
Well, that in and of itself is fine. You know, ten dollars for ten bucks.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.080
That's not that bad, except the thing is that they have their money in the server.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.080
Well, thank God I didn't pay, because I don't want them to have my credit card number.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.080
So, fuck them, I'll play the Japanese one, which is OPM's winner.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:34.080
And... my next fucking movie goes for, um...

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080
Damn it, I'm gonna put that on the list.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.080
Well, you know, it goes for the fact that I don't have anyone to play Fantasy Star Online with.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
I'm trying. I'll be there soon.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:51.080
We need people, if anybody has Fantasy Star Online and managed to get their hands on a Gamecube broadband adapter, play with me, please!

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.080
I don't want to play PSO by myself.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.080
Come play with me!

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080
Would you like to play a game?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.080
Um, other trucks used to be.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.080
Go toward my really awesome band.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.080
Might want to put fire on them.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.080
They're tearing up already and I've had the shoes barely too much.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080
I love those shoes.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:15.080
those shoes

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.160
does stupid people have to drive to work with

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.400
oh my god

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.160
of the most

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160
stupid

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:29.160
fucking people in the world because they can't drive

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.000
i even take the city streets

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
because i don't have to take 50 where even more idiots are

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.880
and you know what?

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.400
they're still idiots

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.400
And they don't know how to drive. So, I don't like them.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.400
They can't have any of my nuts.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.400
SoCalKicks would like to share that he asked for Phantasy Star Online for his birthday.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400
So, you never know.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400
Good luck getting the broadband adapter.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.400
Okay, get this. Nintendo puts out the broadband adapter for the game too.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400
F-Nintendo.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400
And then recalls the thing.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.400
Well, not necessarily. I don't know if it was called or just if they stopped, you know, making them.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:09.400
But why put out a big multiplayer game, and then stop making the adapter? That's retarded.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:16.400
Well, anyway, I've got mine, because, you know, my fiance being a manager of Gamestop, you can pull those little strings and take stuff from me.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.400
But, um, in the meantime, you know, I'm gaming about myself.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.400
And also, if I get Animal Crossing, do I really want to start playing Kingdom Hearts again?

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.400
Never tell if, like, Kingdom Hearts is that way for just therapy, honestly.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.240
You want to check on your village You want to check on your village

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:44.240
You want to go find some looking way You still have 300,000 bells to pay off on

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.240
your own Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.800
Alright, let's hear from Loki, your nephews of the week

01:04:49.800 --> 01:05:04.520
First up, he has to go to eBay. For a few reasons, actually. One is knowing new ad campaigns

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:10.160
they have going where it's like Broadway singers singing stupid crap about eBay. I really don't

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:16.440
want to hear about eBay. eBay is stupid with all these people that bid last minute on stuff.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:22.140
I was winning the two bids on my, you know, pair of pair of crap in my place of the two, if I kept 21.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:29.240
And, yeah, like, one second left, you know, people bid up, you know, on it, going over the price of it.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:35.240
However, I got one of the fucking bastards back, because he bid up on, uh, what was it, my place of the two?

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.440
So I bid up another $30 on it, just to piss him off.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.040
Heh heh. That was cool.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040
Amen.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.140
And so he ended up paying, like, a good $40 over of what they were both worth.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:52.140
Okay, so that's that. And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just hate eBay because it sucks.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.140
They don't have anything good on there.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.140
And, you know, I found, you know, a computer machine.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:01.140
And it was, uh, really cool if I had a little bit of footage, but it's funny right now.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:05.140
And, uh, oh.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.140
I'll tell you what, my plan is to have an outside chair on the computer machine.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:15.140
If you want a machine to try out your little project on, I will volunteer on it.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:19.140
Woohoo! Okay. But yeah, I won't be long.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:24.140
Other things, I have to definitely go with the stupid drivers.

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:28.140
But the stupid people are in general, you know, everywhere, so I hate that.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:33.140
I also, I really, really, really hate the holidays.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:37.140
And it's not because, you know, I'm like a Scrooge or, you know, I hate that kind of thing.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.140
I just hate, you know, I hate the whole, like, constantly playing Christmas music.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.840
I mean, they have, like, four songs that they play over and over. It's really annoying.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.840
I hate, you know, these stupid Christmas tales, and people dressed up like, you know, when they're cold or something.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:07:00.340
I'm just... I hate this shit. It's annoying. People are so stupid around the holidays, and... they all suck.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:04.340
And Christmas lights. What the hell is with that? Seriously.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.540
When did they... everyone is like, well, I have to put some lights in my house for Christmas.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:14.040
I don't understand the point of that. I mean, what, you're trying to, like, flag down spaceships in the land of your fucking house?

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.040
You know, we're talking about holidays with, like, you know...

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.040
I mean, I'm sure, back in tradition, they handled stuff on their Christmas tree.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.040
But I don't think you ever wanted to progress to the point where,

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.540
I have a giant plastic snowman in my front lawn! Yay!

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.040
There's the houses that are tastefully done, with, you know, few white lights are in there,

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.040
but then there's the houses that Christmas throws up on.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:39.040
Yeah, but not when you live in Ghettoville. Ghettoville doesn't have those easily done houses.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.040
Yeah, oh look, there's a giant merkin fly going across the whole court. Whew, fun!

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:51.040
And then we're just gonna randomly throw up lights on our house. Yeah, I don't know, I hate that part of Christmas.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.040
And holidays. I hate the commercialization of holidays. It sucks.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:03.040
I don't really have anything this week. I've been kind of...hired, so...

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.040
I would like to explain on this little holiday discussion.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.040
Go for it.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Okay, everybody knows that I am very tolerant toward other religions and people's beliefs, but I really hate being preached to at Christmas time, okay?

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:24.040
I hate when people come to me, you're gonna go to hell if you don't believe this. It's Christmas.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040
in their Kwanzaa.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040
Okay.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
I'm going to make-

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.040
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Celebrate what you want.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.040
All these Christmas pageants and everything, and they have it snowing and crap.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.040
First of all, if you want to go historically, the time that they would have, you know, and

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.040
this is coming from knowing lots of theologians and everything, if you want to go historically,

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.040
when Jesus was born, okay, they were doing a census.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Since this would have been done coming up into the spring season, so therefore they

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.680
first of all got season wrong. The reason why Christmas is in the wintertime is because

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.040
of the pagan holiday! Hello, you all! You know? Okay then. Give me the whole Christmas

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:17.840
tree! It's pagan! Jesus, did I have a Christmas tree at his manger? Okay. How do you know?

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:26.240
you there did you see it okay douglas furs did not grow in arabia oh yeah sure not under

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.040
the mystical like you know birthing happening here though they just couldn't magically make

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.760
a douglas fir appear out of nowhere sure and like you know bushes catch on fire every day

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.880
okay what about santa claus

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.120
damn it hey you little santa people i just sit here i did have to say santa claus saved

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.840
day in my movie, Feeders 2, he kicked the ass against those aliens, you know, and Santa

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.480
Claus is really, you know, awesome when he has a ray gun.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.480
Remember in Nightmare Before Christmas, Sandy Claus?

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:10.480
Well, how can I follow up these? I don't know. I need to start doing my FUs first, because

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.360
I'm just not as angsty as I am. Quite frankly, I've had a pretty good week, you know, I have

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.200
a lot of that's just to get here that you have to take you to love you thank

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.360
you that you have

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.800
i slept a lot thank you did

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.320
james about their fabulous they're going to go mike cuba working but they're

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.680
beautiful he's you know i thought that once he's been up all you it's so true i

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.480
like the one that says i'd

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.200
go to fight on ours who can go down

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.680
and then he met of course anyway oh yes may have easily

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.060
uh... my perception of the week would be the christmas carol's well i was in

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.060
Taco Bell the other night listening to Christmas Carols.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.660
Oh my god, I'm going to be so nauseatingly sick of Deck the Fucking Halls by the time

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.660
25th world's around.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.660
Just you wait.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:52.660
Just you wait.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.660
I hate Christmas carols.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.340
Um, my second FU of the week, um, would be to work, because I don't want to go back.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.740
I've enjoyed this little vacation too much.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.820
I don't want to go either.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:08.260
And uh, my third FU of the week goes to Olivia at Animal Crossing, because she's five-four.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.260
I need to kill Olivia back in my village.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.260
I think we're up for taking Olivia away from me.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.720
you to people who thinks he sucks just because i can't beat max extreme

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.960
on the e x level yet

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.980
well there's many more reasons you sucked when that's not just the only one

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:55.980
skittles let's play it

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.940
uh...

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.260
all right yes i think there's an f you going out to you i care of the guy's

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.460
name

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.540
i don't remember it was a pretty big remix of let them move

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:14.540
cuz he has a sim file, and it reminded me of one of Twin's things. Actually, he said, and I quote,

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:20.540
this one's actually worse than the ones I did, so that gives you an idea of how bad this thing is.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:26.540
Alright, back to Twin's FUs.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.540
FU to half the chat rooms for not ever taking a joke.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.540
Okay, whatever.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.540
That was funny, haha.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:38.540
Take your happy FUs and cram them.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:41.540
He's at Pensacola. I live from like, near them.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540
Really? Alright on.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:48.540
His girlfriend's from Pensacola. That's like an hour from where I used to live, would be awesome.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:53.540
Oh, and he's gonna miss Orange Lounge to go spend time with a woman.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:13:00.540
Hey, hey, if you get a benefit from missing the show, you need to spend that time.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:06.540
If you're going to miss this show for some pussy, then I suppose, you know, we can forgive you.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.540
Alright, let's see, moving right along.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.540
You are a horror gauntlet.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.540
You are a horror gauntlet.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.540
That's a showgirl's moment, brought to you by horror gauntlet.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:21.540
Stresa says, um, F you to...

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:25.540
The three days that he's played DDR, he's not that bad at all,

01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:03.340
uh, dear lord, there's a lot, okay, um, F you to people who attended Comdex in Vegas,

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:07.980
you whores made traffic a nightmare, and F you to all the exhibitors especially because

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:13.180
it went for the free stuff, and he left disappointed, Comdex sucks, F you to whoever thought of

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.820
Thanksgiving, now I got a fridge full of leftovers and I'm already sick of turkey, it's all about

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:24.380
the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving because pizza is still good the next day, amen. Uh, time

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.180
For the plug, since everybody else got a plug, mostly websites, but while in Vegas, be sure

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:33.260
to visit MidPower's restaurant, Cheerful Chinese Cuisine, in sunny Las Vegas.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:38.340
Opened six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, at 1223 East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.340
Call for take-out.

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.900
Uh, oh, shit.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.740
Wait, we don't want the address broadcast.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.340
And I just read it.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.340
My bad.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.340
Not bad.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:59.900
You need to say it first, then I won't say it.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.900
I'm just reading order.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.820
I read from top to bottom, top to bottom.

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.020
I think I'm done with his FUs now.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.020
Let's go to next FUs.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:12.420
The next set of FUs comes from 23rd Magus.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.420
I have a big FU to Chatroom Drama because it's there.

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:20.420
A medium-sized F.U. to Matsuri, Japan, Maniac throwing off my grooves, and a bike-sized F.U.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.420
I like that, a bike-sized F.U.

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:29.420
To battle.net for screwing up every time he connects, and also a fuck me to any available ladies.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.420
Whoa, hello.

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.420
Whoa!

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.420
Whoa, this isn't hot or not.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.420
Whoa!

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.420
Go sell your meat somewhere else.

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.420
That's right, no selling meat here on Orange Lounge.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.420
Oh, one last F.U. to the school system. I need no explanation. I want all their balls to die.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.420
I think we need shirts. I think we need shirts that say that.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.420
I want all your balls to die.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.420
Should we ask the person who made that shockwave thing?

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.420
Is there a shockwave? I didn't realize there was a shockwave. Oh, my bad.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:00.420
It's a really bad version of the Romeo and Juliet.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.420
But there's an even better one, though, that was Harry Potter.

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.420
With the Draco dance.

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.820
Anyway, Vidpower says,

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.620
FU of the week goes to germs once again because my voice is all harsh and scraggly

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.220
and whenever I cough my body feels like crap.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.140
And FU to stupid mean bowling attendants.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.580
Agreed.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.860
Brack2000 says

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.900
FU to nori nori nori and that one's for 23 minutes.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:33.460
He's doing an FU on behalf of somebody else.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:47.460
D.R. Angel says F you to stomp to my beat because it hates Stresa and I and it won't let us pass it.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.460
good luck.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:10.500
DDR-holic says, it isn't so much an FU, but just a question. Where have you guys been

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.200
on Wednesdays? Do you guys go to RV jail on another day or have you just been busy? Oh,

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.580
but she does want to second Loki's FU to the commercialism of the holidays, especially

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:22.040
the competition. Who freaking cares who has the most expensive decorations? Amen, system.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.380
Just for a second there, guys. We keep reading your name. I'm sorry, I'm saying DDR-holic.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.860
That's a different person.

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:28.860
Coholic.

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.860
Like an alcoholic.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:32.860
Like an alcoholic.

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.860
Okay. My bad.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.860
This is why I'm not in real radio.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.860
DDR Coholic.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.860
DDR Coholic. Coholic.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:43.860
I love the song Holic so much I just want to say that.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.860
Holic holic holic.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.860
So we got it.

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:52.860
Orange Lounge is a international program so we don't like to dwell on the local stuff too much, but

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:58.860
Yes, we've been flacking on Wednesdays lately. That's mostly my bad because I do other things on Wednesday nights now.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:03.860
But Jamie and I have made a commitment to go to Golf Land once a week starting this week.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.860
And probably on Thursday, actually, not Wednesday. So we'll see.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.860
It's a little bit easier to get there on Thursday.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.860
A little bit easier for us to get there on Thursday.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.860
Sometimes it may transfer the time to Scandia because we love Scandia so much more.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:16.860
But you know what? DDRcoholicDear, send me an email. Send the show an email.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.860
Oh well, who cares. Neither is cowgirl, but hey.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:56.860
I'd say fuck you to second-hand smoke, because I really, really, really hate cigarette smoke.

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.860
It's like one of my most hated smells in the entire world.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.860
And especially bad because in one of the local arcade, R2-GL,

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.860
guitar freaks and drumming is kind of close to the front door,

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:16.860
So often I smell the smoke from the parents who I've spoken to a few times.

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.860
Packed with tin.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.860
Chilled my lungs for a while.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.860
And also put me to the cigarette smoke that's close to my heart.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.860
Some mysterious location.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:32.860
I don't hear any air ducts or from the cracks in the windows or something.

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:35.860
There's some noise and a lot of it.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:42.860
And this week, my feud of myself for being a saltless bastard is never calling my parents.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:46.860
And they are my relatives for Thanksgiving.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.860
Ah, that's right. Thanksgiving is a commercial holiday. It's a butterballing event, and don't worry about it.

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.860
It's around the other side of the country.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.860
Of course, they haven't heard from me in a while, so I have to think about it.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.860
My back's in serious trouble.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.860
I'm glad to talk to them.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.860
All right.

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.860
Sorry, I have to talk to you, but I'm coming over. Save me a room.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.860
I did that to my head.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:12.660
He says, my fuck yous would be the damn expansion pack enemies in Diablo II and dumb weathermen

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.060
for getting me all excited about a snowstorm that turned into nothing.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.420
Fuck those weathermen.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.940
You know, I actually was going to be a weatherman.

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.700
I think that's where it came from, I don't know.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.620
Anyway, and then we have some FUs from Martin, who's the guy that sent us the email earlier

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620
in the show.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.620
He's got a lot too.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.860
He says, fuck Christmas shopping for all the crazy people.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:39.580
to crazy people to shop during the Christmas shopping season. Fuck my manager for making

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:44.160
me work the day after Thanksgiving and not giving me hazard pay. Fuck the blue whale

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:51.660
for not living on land. Fuck my teacher for saying the word land in a question that could

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.860
have given my class a pizza party. I don't know what that means. Just not saying the

01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:02.620
word land. I don't know. Fuck the African elephant for being so big. Yes! Fuck the African

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:11.220
elephant you you too big too big fuck the arcade for banning me for a week for

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:18.540
matrix walking shame shame you shouldn't be kicking machine this is this banning

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.020
is a little harsh if they if they didn't tell you not to do it then they should

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.300
at least have a courtesy warning but if they warned you and said don't do it if

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:29.260
you did it again and have much sympathy for you you got to respect their case

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.940
rules but if they just kicked out with no warning that's not that's not cool so

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:36.940
Fuck his computer for not being compatible with a 3D Excelic Creator card.

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.940
Do you have a Mac?

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:38.940
He must be on the back.

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.940
Got a Mac.

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.940
That's it, that's the FUs of the week.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:45.940
And they were special.

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:47.940
All of them wrapped into one big little...

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:48.940
Uh oh, we have another.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.940
Oh! Oh, I got a response from ddrcoholic says,

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:56.940
I can say holic if I want because it can be my nickname for her.

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.940
So I get to call her ddrholic if I want.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:04.940
And one quick F.U. because of the little image that flashes upon your screen while you're closing down Yahoo.

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:09.940
F.U. to that stupid movie Extreme Ops because that's the pissed pile of shit I've ever seen.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.940
Look at that! Oh, we're gonna add extreme people in a spy situation.

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:17.940
Wait, that's never been done before. Oh, wait, yeah it was.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:22.940
So, yeah, F.U. for these stupid extreme spy movies. No one wants us to get it, no one cares.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.940
Fuck bad movies.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:30.540
But the right here knows actually know when the bad movies are like really really really bad like they know they're bad

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:34.700
There's nothing bad that those are awesome. Those are cool, but like bad movies like

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.860
Stray so wants to add the very last if you fuck lawyers fuck I'm

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.700
Yeah

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.260
Okay, we're gonna take a quick break

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:54.260
We're going to come back, and we're going to actually talk about some Bimani-related things.

01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.260
Believe it or not, we have a few topics we wanted to talk about before the night was over.

01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:01.260
And also, when we come back, we will have the cage match.

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.260
This week's Orange Launch cage match will take place.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:09.260
And I think that's about it on the platter for now.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.260
All sorts of fun, Bimani music and then some.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.260
We're going to start this music break off with a little song from 2DX6 style.

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.260
It's a very popular one. You may have heard it a couple times.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.260
It's going to be in DDR Extreme as well.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.260
Enjoy, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.260
Oh

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:30.580
Hi, we're back. We're going to do a quick mic check here. No, see, we're not coming

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:34.860
through if I don't turn that booster on. There, now you can hear us, see? We're trying to

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:39.460
fix our audio problems right now here in house. Let me see if we can turn down the volume

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:44.620
a little bit. Can you still hear us just fine? Hello, hello. Can you hear me now? Can you

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:50.380
hear me now? Can you hear me now? Whee! Where I still hear it a little bit, though, it's

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.380
We'll be right back.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:41.380
I see you in a suit, whichever you want I'm with you, oh, you're with me

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:46.380
You, keep me strong, I'll cover you

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.380
You're the one I need tonight

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.380
Find a way from the start

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:55.380
It's time to pull me out

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.380
Let's face it enough

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:02.380
You're the one I need tonight

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:07.380
From heaven so you'll find

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.380
Can you hear me, baby?

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.380
Can you hear me, baby?

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.380
Can you hear me, baby?

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.380
Can you see all the world we live in?

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:20.380
All the time

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:24.380
We can be born again

01:30:54.380 --> 01:31:11.620
Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy, go out and have

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:12.620

Dream on and you'll realize, that one day you'll pay the price

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.360
Keep on going till tomorrow, you will find there is no sorrow

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.460
Keep on dreaming of this toy you can use my little boy

From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bahmani stuff, comes our Bahmani science lesson

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:26.080
From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bahmani stuff, comes our Bahmani science lesson

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.080
of the day.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:35.080
Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:40.200
Hooray, a fan-made promo we got.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.560
And it has TAC, so it already gets Jamie's seal of approval.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.560
We like that.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.020
Thank you, 23 Megas, for sending us that promo, although it is a little quiet.

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:54.480
You do want to double check and make sure that it's always nice and loud, that your

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.120
levels are somewhere in the yellow.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.600
Not in the red, but just in the tip of the yellow.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.560
Just a little recording advice tip from me, but otherwise, fantastic, we love it.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.920
Let's see, let's talk about some actual Bamani news this week, shall we?

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:07.920
No.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.320
news, but just kind of some interesting little things.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.920
Does it say money old?

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.400
Yeah, it's money old.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.000
There was an interesting thread that came up on one of the big message boards

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.200
this week that talks about a solo machine that was upgraded to a MAX2.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.160
What?

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:31.440
Somebody had took a solo machine and upgraded it to a MAX2.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.720
What is the freaking point?

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:36.840
Because if you recall, MAX2 has no six panel mode in it.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.040
So you've pretty much just taken two of your arrows and completely wasted them.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.760
I'm bringing a picture here in the room so that

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.480
Jamie can take a look for herself, see what this machine's all about.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.600
What do you think it's...

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Loki, I gotta get your opinion on this, being the Tecmasa.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.720
Wait, it curves the bar forward.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.560
Well that's a typical solo bar. A solo bar looks like that.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.840
That means it's actually a Japanese machine, by the way.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.000
You can rate the bar in a whole new way.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.760
That means that that's a Japanese machine.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.760
They just put us DDR Max Upgrading a solo machine. What more do you need to know?

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.760
That's all they did. There's no modifications to it at all. There's just no way they're going to play doubles.

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.760
And it's actually kind of retarded because people like doubles are fucked.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:26.760
Yeah, I'm looking at this. I'm looking at the solo score ranking here. It's always going to be empty forever.

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:31.760
You're fucked if you pick doubles. It's retarded unless it's your own home thing and that's all you've got.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:38.760
It's a solo machine, but it's really stupid. Go to 4th plus or even that unofficial 5th mix.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.760
I mean, just don't stick with it.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.760
You can always get best hits, ooh.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.760
Here's the cream of the crop. As it says in the post, I believe it says in the post somewhere, it says later.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.760
Oh yeah, and then there's a regular Max 2 machine, just 2 machines over from this.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.760
That's so stupid.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:57.760
That's retarded.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.760
Don't!

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:05.440
That gets the Special Olympic Ward stamp of the day.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.840
Go figure, this guy's in Canada.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.840
Just kidding, just kidding.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.160
I just want to say controversial things on this program, what can I say?

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160
Let's see...

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160
That goes with my hatred of the Greek.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.160
Or wait, it was Greek?

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.480
Yeah, but you have a good reason to hate them, because they banned games.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.200
Because they're stupid.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.560
I watched my big fat Greek wedding.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:28.560
Did you?

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.560
That totally sounds like a movie you would not like.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.560
Yeah, it was alright.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.560
Loki, it sounds like a movie.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.560
Oh, Brad, what do you think of this? It's a Max 2 solo machine.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.560
I'm gonna go play Amakasa.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.560
Good answer, good answer.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.560
That wins my special enough at the Olympic stamp award of the day.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.560
They get to ride the short bus.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.560
With their own Max solo machine, ooh.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:03.560
The only thing that could be possibly worse than a Max 2 solo machine is a Max 1 solo machine or a solo bass.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.560
No, I think a solo bass is slightly better. At least it has my baby mama.

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:18.560
I wouldn't exactly say upgrading. Downgrading a Max 2 full machine to a solo bass.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.560
That's retarded right there.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.560
The only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is somebody playing Burning Heat on that Max 2 solo machine.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.560
No, I'm kidding.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.560
God. Okay.

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.560
Oh, yes, yes.

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:39.560
I know this is a few episodes back, but the only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is upskirt Beatmania 5-key.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.560
No, the cam.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.560
Anyway.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.560
Let's talk about another topic, shall we?

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.560
Next, please.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.560
Moving right along.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:57.720
Oh, yes, we were talking about another interesting thread that I saw was about this kind of...

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:02.320
Since the Christmas season is here, there's this sudden push, and DDR is getting bigger

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.660
and bigger, and more and more well-known, and bigger and bitter, and we're all getting

01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.760
bitter, as the jaded old-schoolers we are.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:14.500
We see that there's these new children's dance pats games coming out, including a Barney

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:18.680
game, a Barbie dance game that you plug directly into your TV.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:21.760
It's been out for a while, but of course it's Christmas time, so a lot of the stores are

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.080
pushing these again.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.560
You know, here's a Christmas toy that won't make your kid fat.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.520
That's basically how they're marketing these.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.940
This just gives them all the vibrating Nimbus 2000s.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.640
This is very old.

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.840
The Jungle Book Dancing Game.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.680
Now for those who don't know out there, this was out before Max USA even was.

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.440
I remember going to your old apartment.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.160
I had the Jungle Book Dance Game.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.080
Giving you third kicks and playing on that tiny ass little pad.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.840
The Jungle Book Dance Pad was my very first dance pad.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.240
I actually have the Jungle Book game, too, but I don't have the pad.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.000
And Jamie brought over third mix one night, and we played all night long.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.800
It was so much fun.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.880
Here, let me liberate your mind.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.640
It was beautiful.

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.360
Before that, all I'd ever seen was USA and first mix.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.560
And all of a sudden, you put in third mix.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.120
I'm like, oh my god.

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:05.920
There's modes.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.160
Holiday, erotic, I'm in love.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.000
And it was karaoke mode, too.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.520
Yes, and karaoke mode.

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.720
Wish there was nothing in another mix.

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.080
Now, uh, what do you guys think of all these little kid games?

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.920
You think it's good for Bimani because it trains them at a young age?

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.120
I want the Hello Kitty DDR just for five-year-olds.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.320
It's actually a DDR.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.320
Where's the Oha Kids arcade games?

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Don't they have one in Vegas?

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Did you say at that one arcade you went to they had a DDR for kids?

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.320
No.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320
I'm just on crack, I'm sorry.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.640
They had Radiant Silver Gun.

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640
Oh.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.020
Who had the DDR for kids?

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:51.020
I could have sworn somebody told me somebody in Vegas had them.

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.860
Very interesting.

01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:59.860
I would call some people in the chat room are talking about Disney's rave being a kid

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:05.340
game or I'm sorry Disney Mix in the U.S. I don't know.

01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:07.180
You think Disney's Mix is for kids?

01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:10.020
I think Dance Magic makes Disney Mix though.

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.020
these raves for people who are like, I would like Para Para, but I want to get into DDR.

01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:20.020
Boom, there you go. That's what it is. It's just all, it's DDR Para Para mix.

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.180
Vidpower, who's from Vegas, by the way, is confirming they do have a DDR Kids machine

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:29.580
there. I don't know if that means it's OHA. Is it OHA songs? Vidpower, what are the songs

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:35.780
in DDR Kids? Is it OHA stuff, or what is it? I'm just kind of asking questions to our chat

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.780
waiting for a reply.

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.280
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.280
Yeah.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.280
Oh, what are you guys talking about over there?

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:45.780
Share with us.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:48.280
We're talking about Game Land in Las Vegas.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280
OK, talk about Game Land.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.280
Oh, Game Land has DDR Kids.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:52.780
No.

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.780
It's being confirmed by VidPower.

01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:54.780
VidPower's from Vegas.

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.780
And they must have gotten it after I played there,

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.280
because I was there for the DDRP moderator trip.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.280
Possible.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.280
And what they had, I went in there, and this is actually,

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.280
When everybody was quoting each other, what we sent for the moderator trip, this is what I was quoted as going,

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.280
Eeee, radiant silver gun!

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.280
Oh, it's not OHA songs, I'm being corrected.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.280
It's just different songs.

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.280
That's all I can get.

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.280
Special.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.280
Different places!

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280
Hey, get us a song list.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.280
Yeah, get us a song list.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.280
We want to talk about it.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280
We want to come play.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280
We're going to go to Vegas.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.280
We're planning an Orange Lounge Vegas trip at some point.

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.280
Yeah, and someone can pay for it.

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.280
Oh, VidPower does confirm they got it after you were there.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:34.780
Okay.

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:11.280
on the radio already. That's the Black Mage. Yeah, it says Bolt 2 motherfucker.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.840
Other big things in the news. This is big news. It has really nothing to do with Bimani,

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.280
but it's big news in the gaming world. As most Bimani people are a bunch of big gaming

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.600
addicts, we thought we'd mention it. Square and Enix. Enix bought Square. Did this little

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.800
merger type thing. I thought that it was a merger of equals because of their name. It's

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.720
a merger of equals. No, but once I looked at the stuff I'm going to have to go check

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:39.880
the business sites to confirm it, but I think that Enix holds a 70-80% share, so it's not

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.360
a pure merger of equals.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.660
If it was a merger of equals, the ratio would be no more than 10% different.

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.560
Any thoughts on what's going to happen because of this?

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:54.240
We're going to be getting Final Quest Fantasy X with all of the art done by Toriyama.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.240
Urgits!

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.240
Urgits!

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.320
I want more urgits!

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320
Really the fighting game, right?

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.320
We're going to get air guys with the Dragon Quest characters.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:12.320
Well, you know, didn't Aenix, weren't they responsible for Busta Group?

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.320
Busta Move.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:20.320
Yes, Aenix and Metro were responsible for Busta Move and Busta Move 2.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.320
They're also, you know, I still haven't gotten to play Busta Move 2001 or whatever the hell it was.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.320
DDR Busta Move 2003 with Cloud and Yuffie, oh my god.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:35.320
But it's also just Star Ocean.

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:40.320
I honestly don't think they're going to be lame and start crossing all their story lines.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320
I don't think a damn thing's going to change.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.320
Even better than all those, though, is Actraiser Soulblazer.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.320
Actraiser. Actraiser was the best game ever.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.320
So moist.

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.320
Since What's-His-Name Uematsu is not going to do Final Fantasy music anymore, they're phasing him out,

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:57.320
they need to get that guy who did Actraiser's music.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.320
They need to get him.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320
That's going to be the best thing about this.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:06.320
Actually, come to think of it, the pre-show disc, I actually have an Overclocked remix of the Filmore theme.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.320
I love the... oh yeah, Act eraser.

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:13.320
Anyway, you know, Dan and I had a discussion about this.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.320
And for anybody who has ever heard me, who knows me and Dan, or has heard me talk about him or us talk,

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.320
we're both really major gamers. We own like 42 million game systems.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.320
No.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:33.880
Anyway, we were having this discussion and we decided that it might be a good thing because

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:43.400
I want to catch Aynix up to the modern day and teach Square how to be old school again.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.200
This is happening for a couple reasons.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:52.280
A, Final Fantasy XI fucking tanked in Japan because they fucked it up.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.360
They completely fucked up that hard drive thing in the online...

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.800
Like the movie? Bad idea.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.800
Final Fantasy Online was a bad idea. Square Japan had nothing to do with the movie, and the movie was actually good and it just shouldn't have been called Final Fantasy.

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.760
The movie fucked it up for Square. Honestly,

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.740
the movie was decent, but it wasn't... I think Pixar's interested in it now. It was not Final Fantasy.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:17.020
They should not have been called Final Fantasy. Did not deserve the Final Fantasy name. As a movie, the movie was good.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.880
The movie was excellent.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:19.880
But it wasn't Final Fantasy.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:20.880
Right.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:21.880
It wasn't Final Fantasy.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:22.880
Thank you.

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.000
That's all I have to say on that.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.280
But, and this is what I always said with a friend of mine who always talked about this

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.680
too, we should, because the movie was really being designed about the time the eight was

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.680
made.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:38.240
Honestly, the movie should have been a game and eight should have been the movie.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.000
Eight would have been an excellent movie and it made a horrible game.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.400
Or ten as the movie.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.000
But ten, see ten, the thing with Final Fantasy, I can't believe we're talking about Final

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:59.000
The thing with Final Fantasy X is that the way it's designed is that next generation of movie slash game. You don't see it as a movie.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
It's a cinematic RPG.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I would have liked if they created a movie that's kind of a cross between VII and X.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.760
7 and 10. Because 7 had really cool futuristic worlds and all the machines and stuff. And

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:16.920
then 10 had that really kick-ass stuff in it too. Which I love. I love that one song,

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.440
Otherworld, that's in the very beginning. That's the heavy metal music that's in it.

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.880
It's fucking awesome. I love that song.

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:30.880
Well, you know, one thing. I was reading an interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who was like

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.760
the best artist in the world, who did all of the original character designs for the

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.800
first Final Fantasy games, one through six.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:45.120
He didn't do any of the character designs for seven or eight, he did them for nine,

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.800
but he was very discouraged by the direction that the Final Fantasy series was going in,

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:57.640
that it was leaving the fantasy behind, and so that was always why I agreed that the earlier

01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.640
games were the best.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:04.640
My favorite Final Fantasy game is 5, followed by 3, but I've got to play a 3.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.640
4 was okay, 6 was really excellent, but I liked the whole job class thing in 5.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.640
Everybody our age that played video games will always remember the Final Fantasy 6 opera.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.640
No, it's always for me, them in the magitech armor walking across the ice plane.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:20.640
That too, yeah, that too.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Just, oh, it's so nostalgic, what can you say?

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:27.640
I have a special message for Gumby?

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640
You!

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640
That's all.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640
What was that?

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640
He's teasing me because my voice is cracking.

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640
Oh my god.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.200
Can we just call you Ron Weasley now?

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.200
Shut up!

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.200
Shut up!

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.200
No, he doesn't have the red hat.

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200
Shut up.

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.200
Alright.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.560
We'll just put you in a Ford and have you drive him around.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.080
Speaking of Final Fantasy, why don't we get to this week's cage match, shall we?

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.080
Unless anything else...

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.080
Cage match!

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.960
Does anybody else have something to say about Square Enix merging?

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.600
Does anyone really give a shit?

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600
I don't give a shit, personally.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.120
A couple of comics ago, you said something about it, you can't believe we're talking

01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:57.120
about Final Fantasy.

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.120
I can make a, what is it, a Kevin Bacon thing, six degrees or whatever.

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.120
Probably excuse me, my Squaresoft.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.120
Squaresoft made a game called Brave Fencer Musashi.

01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:10.120
At the end of Brave Fencer Musashi, there's a music dance game that's pretty much like DDR.

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.120
But it's, yeah, actually it's like Simon Says.

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:12.120
Really?

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.120
There you go, yep.

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.120
Damn, I gotta play that game now.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:22.120
There's a DDR mode in SNK versus Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:23.120
That's not Squaresoft.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120
But there's DDR.

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:31.620
On a total different tangent here, the chat room is now trying to put us all with Harry

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:32.620
Potter characters.

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.620
Jamie, you're now Aromone.

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:35.900
I would not be Hermione, hello?

01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:40.980
Okay, because first of all, with every damn sorting test I've ever taken, I always come

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:41.980
up Slytherin.

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:45.180
She's Draco because she's evil.

01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:48.260
And I guess that leaves Loki to be Harry Potter.

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.800
Get the glasses!

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:53.060
I have glasses and I don't look like Harry Potter.

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:58.580
We can draw like a little lightning scar on his head.

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.900
I'm not going to be pansy, hello.

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:04.300
Alright.

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:11.500
Oh yes, another excellent, on the Square Enix merger, they're saying that April 1st is when

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:15.880
this is supposed to happen so it causes a lot of skepticism, however, if I'm not mistaking

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.460
this news that's coming out of Japan, April 1st doesn't mean shit in Japan.

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:21.420
There's no April 1st.

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.420
So it doesn't matter, but I don't know, who knows?

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.420
Don't put Americans in their April Foothills.

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.420
We could all get...

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.420
We could all be having the wool pulled over our eyes on this.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:31.420
Like I said, I don't think it's really going to matter anyway.

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:33.420
So what? They merge. Big fucking deal.

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.420
I don't care.

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.420
Next.

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.420
Next.

01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:43.420
I'm going to turn on the app here because I need some in-studio sound to deal with this...

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:47.420
We apologize for the humming again. We don't know what's causing it.

01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:51.220
We're going to take a hammer to the computer after the show and figure out what's going

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:52.220
on.

01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:53.220
So, we apologize.

01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.220
It's something to do with the mics.

01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.220
Maybe our mics are just cheap.

01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.220
I don't know.

01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:57.220
Let's go get some new ones.

01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.480
Anyway, let's talk about the cage match.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.660
Would you like to explain the rules for the cage match?

01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.460
The lovely Miss Dark Sakura.

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:07.700
We're going to play some songs, and you tell us if it sucks or not.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:14.220
Basically, okay, for anybody who watches TV, which I don't, but I've seen American Idol,

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:17.900
We're going to place a couple songs all the way through, and then we're going to review

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:18.900
them.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.220
Ashley, we're just going to play a clip of last...

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.300
You can vote for last week's winner, but we're only going to play a small clip of it.

01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.300
We're going to play a clip of last week's winner.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:28.420
Because you all have been listening to our Bomani Music Amore program, airing 24 hours

01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.620
a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're not on, and you've heard it already, right?

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:32.620
Yes?

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:33.620
Yes.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.620
You don't need to play it all again.

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.620
So we're going to give our opinions on the songs again.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.740
Of course, the new one's going to be played all the way through.

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:45.820
You as the chat room get to decide which one of these is going to be our next big thing.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:49.180
So the winner of the cage match will be put into rotation on the normal Bimani Musica

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.180
Morpher M this week.

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:51.380
So you're going to vote for a winner.

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:57.500
Now you can vote for last week's victor, but once last week's winner wins what?

01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:58.500
Once the song wins what?

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.900
Three, four weeks, we retire it and it can't win anymore.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:01.900
What do we think?

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:02.900
Four weeks?

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.900
Three?

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:06.340
Give it a month.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.340
We give it a month.

01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.340
Okay, so four weeks.

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.880
for four weeks, it gets retired. Yeah, then it goes in permanently. So, this is our winner

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:20.880
from last week, was the Final Fantasy Music DJ. This was an overclocked remix of... I'm

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:24.080
sorry, yes, Loki, would you like to explain last week's victor?

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:31.080
It was a remix from Final Fantasy VII. It's the, uh, quick, very squishy, uh, 4L prison

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:54.080
Alright, that was last week's victor, the Corelle Prison remix theme, overclocked remix

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.700
by FFMusicDJ.

01:52:55.700 --> 01:53:00.280
So you can vote for that, or you can vote for something new!

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:05.400
new and in the mix this week we have this is something for the pre-show but

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:09.600
it's so fucking cool we're putting it in the cage match Jamie please tell us I

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:14.160
was looking for happy hardcore remakes last night and I found the Knight Rider

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:20.160
theme if who remembers watching David Hasselhoff with his hair and the car I

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:29.120
was in third grade David Hasselhoff was just like in the 80s he was cool and

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.120
David Hasselhoff, he's so dreamy.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.120
And then there was Baywatch, and he's loved in Germany.

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.120
I think we should just play the song.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:42.120
Alright, so the first song, and remember you cannot vote until the second song is finished playing.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.120
So we're going to play the first song for you in today's cage match.

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.120
This is the Knight Rider theme from Happy Hardcore. Enjoy.

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.120
My bad, it's not from Happy 2D Hardcore, it's just a random mix.

01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:03.120
here it is

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.120
Oh

01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:08.480
Alright, the cage match is in effect here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.000
That was the Knight Rider theme.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
What did you guys think of that here in the room?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Jamie?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
God damn, that was cool.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Alright.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Dave, what did you think of the Knight Rider theme?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
It was pretty cool.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Alright.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Loki?

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I liked it.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I liked the original theme.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I liked it. I liked the original theme. It kind of lost a little bit of it in the middle there. I liked the pointy part of it.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Bradley, your thoughts on the Knight Rider mix?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
It's pretty good.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Pretty good. I'd have to say it's cool for about the first minute when that nostalgia kicks in, but three minutes of it is a little bit much. I don't know.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Alright, rate it on a scale of one to ten. Jamie, on a scale of one to ten?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Nine.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Nine. Dave?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Eight.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Eight. Logie?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.120
8.

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:53.120
Bradley?

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:53.800
7.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.820
7. And I'll give it, I'll give it a 7.5.

01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:56.820
Alright.

01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:58.740
So, I'm a harsh judge, what can I say.

01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.000
Alright, that was the Knight Rider theme.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.720
So, we got one more song here for the CAGED match,

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.700
and I'm gonna play that for you right now.

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.380
It's coming off a CD, so I don't know how this is gonna work.

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:15.540
Might be a little weird, but,

01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:20.540
This is a remix done by Hybrid of the Crystal Method, the name of the game.

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.540
It's Hybrid's L.A. Blackout remix.

01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:26.540
Alright, this is the second one in the Orange Launch Radio Cage match.

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:33.540
the crystal method with the name of the game.

02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:27.540
Hey!

02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:28.540
Hey!

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.540
Hey!

02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:30.540
Hey!

02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:31.540
Hey!

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:32.540
Hey!

02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:33.540
Hey!

02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:34.540
Hey!

02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:35.540
Hey!

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:36.540
Hey!

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.540
Hey!

02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:39.540
Oh

02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:36.540
Callin' y'all freaks now Callin' y'all freaks now

02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.540
All in all freaks now

02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:41.540
Got the pain, hold it

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.540
All in all freaks

02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:54.540
All in all freaks now

02:03:54.540 --> 02:04:21.060
All right, that was Crystal Method with the name of the game.

02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:22.460
Jamie, your thoughts on that?

02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:25.100
oh you're yawning over there

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.460
boring you okay i think

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:28.820
your thoughts

02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:32.000
well if you have the right idea cut it down

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.660
yes

02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:36.660
rats in the room what do you think about eating to come in the last one what do you think of this one

02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:43.660
well the original song has always been my favorite song ever

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.100
haha what do you think of it

02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:50.140
i like the song

02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:57.140
Obviously, yes, it was too long. The original one is also my favorite Chris Benson song ever.

02:04:57.140 --> 02:05:05.140
I do have to add, though, that this is my turn. It's a terrific pre-entry, except I haven't touched it down in two and a half minutes.

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:08.140
No longer is it two and a half minutes, but yeah, I like it.

02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:10.140
Bradley, your thoughts?

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.140
It's been really good.

02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:12.140
It's been really good.

02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:18.140
My thoughts, it's a cool song for a minute and a half.

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:24.140
Same thing, same thing as the last song. Little long, little long for me, but I bet it's gonna kick a lot of ass in DDR, uh, in DDR, shouldn't it?

02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:27.140
Let's break it down, scale of one to ten, Jamie.

02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:31.140
They have lots of parts that I like, and they have parts that I'm looking forward to.

02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:34.140
I'd give it a six and a half.

02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:36.140
Six and a half from Jamie. Dave.

02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:44.140
Yeah, I mean, whenever it switched to a new part, then it was cool, but then it kept going on that part for like a minute and a half each.

02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:47.140
So, um, I'll be generous, I'll give it a seven.

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:49.140
Seven. Brad.

02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.140
Since I didn't hear their whole song, I have to be fair.

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.140
I guess I can't give it a ten or anything.

02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:57.140
But I mean, it sounded good when I heard it, so I guess I'll give it a seven.

02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.140
Seven.

02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:02.140
Logie, I can be biased because it's my song, so I'm giving it a ten.

02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:04.140
Alright, ten. Bradley.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.140
I'll give it a six.

02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:08.140
You give it a six. I give it a six and a half as well.

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:10.140
Alright, there's your votes.

02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:13.140

over normal private message. Yes, yes, Gumby. Gumby, you should know better. God. Gee, someone

02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:25.820
who has his own little team should know. I'm just fucking with him. I'm giving him a hard

02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:29.740
time because I can't. He likes, Gumby likes it when I give him a hard time. You know,

02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:37.060
wink wink, nudge nudge. Say no more. Alright, we'll be revealing those votes in a little

02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:43.800
bit. Moving right along though, we're going to talk about, oh our new web forums! Everybody

02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:58.680

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:03.520
because they're free. They're not easyboard because I fucking hate easyboard and I wouldn't

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:08.780
use them so I use somebody else excellent service my icon board you know

02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:11.920

don't also visit that web board oh yes please mention live journal community

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:40.500
If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, all one word, that is where our live journal community is and go check it out. It's very orange.

02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:43.500
Yes, it's very orange. It's a very pretty design though. I must...

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:46.500
Think, think. I'm on board for that. Not I can board for it.

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.500
Live journal.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.500
Live journal for that. I just picked a default. It was orange.

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.500
You just picked a default, Steve.

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:55.820
And then, let's see, what else can we talk about?

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.900
I wanted to talk about this really fast, if I can get this to bring up.

02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:03.860
What's being released, I believe this week, is a Good Cool compilation.

02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:07.980
Someone can get that for me for Christmas.

02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:14.340
I believe it's Good Cool Songs, and what they did, something about, Santa's redone all the

02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.940
songs in English.

02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:20.240
I don't know, at least the preview songs on the website, Santa's singing them and they're

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.240
in English.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:28.240
But, we're going to get a quick clip of one of those songs for you right here.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:30.240
Let me see if I can get you one of these.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:33.240
Okay, we're going to hear a quick clip of one of these songs right here.

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:38.240
I apologize if we do a dropout real fast, but I want to be able to play this clip for you guys, so here we go.

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.240
I'm going to turn on the speaker so you guys in house can hear it.

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:44.240
Let's see if it comes up. It's loading right now.

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:50.240
I'm trying to get a clip of 19 November for the Good Cool album, which comes out on December 4th, so it comes out this week.

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.240
comes out this week. Okay, here we go. Connecting, la la la la la. Let's try to connect to the

02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:02.240
Here it goes. Here's a small clip of what this will sound like.

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.240
I know you know everything but you know

02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.240
Come back, Brad. We love you.

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:01.240
But we still hate Polteri.

02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:03.240
Why? Why Polteri? Why?

02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:05.240
Because Santa should not be singing in English.

02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:07.240
Hell, Santa should not be singing.

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.240
She sings because she did a really nice song on the shining Polaris.

02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.240
Shining Polaris was good.

02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:16.240
Yeah. That's because LED kicks ass.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.240
They should fork out the money and get Utada Hikaru.

02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.240
Or Ayumi.

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.240
Just fork out the money.

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:34.240
What's awesome is, I don't know if anybody's played the Game Boy BeatMania games, I know that's pretty ghetto, but they've got some pretty cool licensed tracks on there. They do have a Youtuber song on there.

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:42.240
I played the one on Wonderswan that has the digitized music. I played the BeatMania that was on Wonderswan. It was all digitized.

02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:47.240
Yeah, I have a Wonderswan color and the little turntable wouldn't fit on my thing very well.

02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.240
Well, Guitar Freaks has Depend On You.

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.240
Depend On You, that's Ayumi Hamasaki, isn't it?

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.240
It's not her singing.

02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:58.240
It's Ayumi, but it's not her singing.

02:11:58.240 --> 02:11:59.240
It's her song, but her singing.

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.240
Just like, you know, Another World.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.240
It's not GAC'd!

02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:03.240
I can't believe it's not GAC'd.

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.240
I can believe it's not GAC'd. It sounds like shit.

02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:10.240
Uh, so the Good Cool CD comes out December 4th.

02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:13.240

And when the winner wins, they win.

Winter wins, they win.

02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:08.820
Hooray.

02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:12.220
So in the meantime, let's play the real version of 19 November, shall we?

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.220
Yes, please.

02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:14.660
Because otherwise I'm going to have a cry.

02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:15.660
It is what it is.

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:17.860
The only time is now.

02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:21.780
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:24.140
Our condolences.

02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:32.380
Whoa, hello, it's not playing.

02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:34.960
Let's see what's going on here.

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.060
Just a quick problem.

02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:42.020
Leave me by your brilliant light

02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:47.020
Shine, shine

02:16:47.020 --> 02:17:02.020
I know I'm not ready to die

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:12.020
I know I'm not ready to die

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:55.020
I got the beat and I rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

02:17:55.020 --> 02:18:02.020
Higher and higher I'm burning like a fire

02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:11.020
Higher and higher I'll make you higher

02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:14.620
Stop screaming and try to look hard I get my body up, you did that booty jog

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:18.420
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been In the game, dream old, since the day of X-Men

02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:22.020
Way back when, I've been putting it down Ask how homie who's the baddest, but yo, who's got time?

02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:24.020
I float like a butterfly, sing like a meme

02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:27.520
Sectacular orbit in my city, that old promotion, never giving it less than the best

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.520
Rock the ears in the game, that's your request

02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.520
You like the rhymes, right, can't you dare?

02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:33.020
I kiss the vector so I don't care

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:35.020
Why, that's me, seen the victim in me

02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.020
What a real in-scene is supposed to be

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:40.520
Fucking you up, every time that I drop the fucking ruler, baby, I done took the spot

02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:44.520
I got the beat and the rock, rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.520
Higher than higher

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.520
I'm gonna light the fire

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:55.520
Higher than higher

02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.520
I'm gonna make you higher

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:06.520
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:09.520
Big ass bongo demands it!

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:42.520
With over half the votes, out of three choices, over half the votes, the winner was...

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:46.520
...Rider team, let's jump.

02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:50.520
David Hasselhoff is cool.

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.520
David Hasselhoff was cool.

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:55.520
Big difference, alright.

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.520
Was cool.

02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:58.520
Actually, that's borderline cool.

02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520
It was great in South Park.

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.520
Thank you to everyone who voted, we appreciate it.

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.520
Of course.

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:10.520
Oh, I'm being given a link to the DDR Kids machine. Let's have a look-see-loo at this.

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:17.520
A look-see-loo! Oh, my voice got a vote for the cage-backed winner.

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:20.520
Thank you, Gumby.

02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:22.520
Actually, I think it was Twen that voted for that, but hey.

02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.520
Oh, there's a picture of the Dance of the Revolution Kids machine.

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:25.520
I've seen them before.

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.520
That's so cheesy!

02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.520
They were selling one on eBay.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:29.520
That's so cheesy.

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:30.520
Remember? They were selling one on eBay.

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:34.520
That's right, they were selling one. That's probably how the place got it.

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.520
It looks like a what, Dave?

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.520
A freaky sewing machine, kind of like Mickey Mouse.

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.520
I thought you said a sewing machine.

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:48.520
That's what I thought you said, Jeff. It looks like one of those picture maker things.

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.520
Oh, very cute.

02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:58.520
Is there any other pictures? No, it just shows all the different kinds of DDR.

02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:02.520
All right. Well, whatever. Cool.

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:06.520
Let's see. Oh, a deer.

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:10.520
Top hits don't count. Top hits his ass.

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:14.520
Okay. I'm afraid to look at this.

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.520
Oh, that's cute. That's very cute.

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:22.520

Yeah.

02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:50.920
Alright.

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.920
So I think that we should move right along to our next game show.

02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:56.920
I think we should move right into our next game show.

02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:59.920
But we're going to first back this up with a story.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:01.920
I wanted to talk about this a little bit because it's the holidays.

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:02.920
A story.

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:03.920
A story.

02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.920
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.920
I gotta find this story.

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:10.920
And I'm logged into the wrong account right now.

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:11.920
I'm not gonna be able to pull up the story. Hold on.

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:13.920
Jamie, tell a story about your day or something.

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:15.920
I need time to fill here.

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:27.920
laundry today, Rob. I washed my pants. A clean DDR is a fun DDR, and a happy DDR. Yeah.

02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:35.020
I played Kingdom Hearts, and then I played Max USA, and I don't know, it's so stupid

02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:38.180
how you have to play all these songs, because I've already done everything there is to do

02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:42.180
And I've got nothing left to do except try to unlock songs.

02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:45.180
And then, days lead over.

02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:48.180
Because they ended with getting hit in the head with a weasel.

02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.180
Well, no, he lit the menorah out too, right?

02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.180
I do that when I get back.

02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:55.180
Oh, you do that when you get back.

02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:56.180
Orange Lounge comes first.

02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:58.180
Orange Lounge always comes.

02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:01.180
Orange Lounge is above all holy holidays.

02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:04.180
You've seen Rob Schneider as a gigolo.

02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:07.180
You've seen Rob Schneider as a woman.

02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:10.980
Now, see Rob Schneider as a stapler!

02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:13.980
Oh, crap.

02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:21.980
I've been given some interesting stuff, and this is coming from Gumby, so you know this is going to be weird. Let's see.

02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:26.980
Gumby is sending me an article on...

02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:28.980
Good scene!

02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:33.980
It says it got size in the title, which sounds like, I don't know, it's not loading.

02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:41.780
Gumbi, thy link is broken, you suck, you lose.

02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:44.380
Maybe it's just because we're trying to broadcast a show and we can't see it right now.

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:45.380
Let's see.

02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:46.860
I'm just following random links that the chat room is sending me.

02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:48.860
This is scary.

02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:50.820
Oh, that's cute.

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:51.820
That's very cute.

02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:56.180
Can you send me a picture of Counter-Strike where somebody's got little red octane dance

02:23:56.180 --> 02:24:01.920
pads there and they give 100 health apparently, or they take 100 health more likely.

02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:06.920
They also take a hundred intelligence!

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:08.920
Ah, kill me.

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:14.920
Alright, let's see, I need to find this news article I was looking for, my bad.

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:17.920
Brad, tell us about your day.

02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.920
I was over, you know, I was over here at 4 AM playing...

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:24.920
Pretend you don't know and tell me again!

02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:25.920
Fuck you.

02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:28.920
Okay, I was over here at 4 AM playing your Animal Crossing.

02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:35.920
We left, we went to bed, we woke up at 1pm, yes we have lives, and we came over here and

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:36.920
played more.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:37.920
Rob, how was your day?

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:39.640
My day was fabulous, thank you for asking.

02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:43.640
Okay, I got the link up that I wanted, thank you.

02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:46.320
Oh yes, we're going to talk about, because the day-

02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:47.800
Rob got it up.

02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.800
Shut up.

02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:49.800
Shut up.

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.800
And I'm the show too!

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:51.800
You woman!

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:52.800
Anyway.

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:54.680
Uh, yeah, hello.

02:24:54.680 --> 02:25:01.480
Go play your Grand Theft Auto woman mix in your Miata and your VW Bug.

02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:04.120
Bullshit, I'd have the terrain up.

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:10.720
Anyway, we want to talk about the day after Thanksgiving is commonly known as the oh fuck

02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:12.160
stay away from the mall day.

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:13.160
In other words...

02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:14.160
Black Friday.

02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:15.160
Black Friday, yes.

02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.160
Black Friday.

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.560
The day when you do not want to be caught dead anywhere near a mall because it's that

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.960
time of year to go shopping.

02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:22.960
I went to the mall.

02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:29.040
And of course, every year they release the list of the top holiday toys.

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.000
So I thought they've compiled a list, this station WESH, I have no idea where they're

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
located.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Sounds almost like...

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
It doesn't matter.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.120
It doesn't matter where they're located.

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:39.920
They're W, so they're east coast.

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:41.480
They're somewhere east coast.

02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:44.240
They're stating it's a great time to start your Christmas shopping, you can beat the

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.720
rush and the shelves are stocked, but what's going to be popular this year?

02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.680
You know how kids are in general, they don't care how much a toy costs or who makes it.

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:53.160
They just want to have fun.

02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:54.160
So Yahoo!

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.160
site for kids, Yahoo!

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:59.000
Republicans, gave kids a chance to vote for toys on their wish list and these are the

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.240
top five toys that kids are looking for for Christmas this year.

02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:11.120
The number five, this is amazing to me, the number five toy, Singing Stars Video Karaoke.

02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:13.240
It allows kids to become the next superstar.

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.560
It's a hundred dollar karaoke machine.

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.960
It's like American Idol except that you don't have to get bitched at.

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:19.960
That should be the add-on.

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.960
It's like, get the little British guy to bitch at you and yell and tell you that you're no good.

02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.960
The future generation of single, old people.

02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:28.960
Come over to my house, I'll bitch you.

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:35.960
Drunken in a bar singing drunken music from times when they remember they were young.

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:36.960
Yeah.

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.960
You're gonna be high on pixie sticks.

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.960
I weep for the future.

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:46.960
Moving right along, the number four Christmas toy.

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.960
The Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.

02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.960
I cry for America.

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.960
Okay. The concept of this whole Yu-Gi-Oh thing is just shit.

02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.960
Let's make a show about a card game.

02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:00.960
Card games are cool. People just love watching card games.

02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:02.960
They don't like participating in card games.

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:04.960
But watching them are really fun.

02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.960
Especially when little holographic things happen.

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.960
No. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.960
Not to mention this thing came out in 1991.

02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:15.960
Crap.

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:26.160
and crap. Alright, so that was the number 4 holiday toy this year. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait,

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:33.600
so, hold on. The Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game, are they talking about like a pack of 9 cards

02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:41.160
cost just under $9? That's what the website says. I believe everything I read online,

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:46.080
so let's go to the next one let's go to the next one jamie why don't you tell us

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.040

Bratz dolls and it cost $25 I don't even know what my mom would not let me get

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.720
gem dolls because she thought that their heads were too big like crack babies

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.720
These make the gem dolls look tame, okay?

02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.720
However, the boy ones are kind of cool.

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.720
Was that like the drag Ken dolls, or what do they call it?

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.720
Those gay Ken dolls? Or the drag ones? I don't know.

02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:54.720
You know there was actually a gay Ken doll?

02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:58.720
Yeah, I know.

02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:02.720
That totally sounds like something they'd sell in the Castro.

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:11.240
He wore a ring, it was supposed to be like a medallion, a ring around his neck, on a

02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:12.240
chain.

02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:13.240
Ring around the cocky.

02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:16.160
And it was, and it was a cock ring.

02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:17.160
No.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:19.800
No, was it like magnum size, or?

02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:22.480
No, I didn't have one.

02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:23.480
Magnum size.

02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:24.480
Next!

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:29.000
The number one toy this holiday season, Jamie, what is it?

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
A Game Boy Advance.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Yes, that's right.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.720
If you have to ask what a Game Boy Advance is, then go back and bury your head back in

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:35.720
the hole.

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:40.440
Now, obviously, we here in the room disagree with this list completely, so we are going

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:49.080
to give you, during this next List List segment, our top three video game related things we

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:53.500
want for Christmas, or we think somebody should have for Christmas.

02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:58.280
So it's our top three video game, video gamer's Christmas list.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.280
And we're going to do that.

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:04.480
quick break so we can prepare our list and then we'll be right back. So listen to some

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:07.880
music real fast. We're going to keep this really brief because we want to get this done

02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:17.040
before the show's over. So why don't you listen to something from 2DX8 style. How about our

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:21.640
favorite band? Why? Because we took their name. Orange Lounge from 2DX8 style here on

02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:51.440
art Tonsins radio.

02:31:21.440 --> 02:31:25.440
So

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:29.440
Do

02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:33.440
So

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:37.440
Do

02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:41.440
So

02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:45.440
Do

02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:49.440
Do

02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:21.440
Oh

02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:42.800
All right, we are back.

02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:47.140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and now we're going to start a little thing we

02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:51.100
We call Listless here, and I'm trying to find our Listless music, although I don't know

02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:53.100
if I have it cued up.

02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:56.860
I might have to substitute a different game show theme because I can't find it.

02:33:56.860 --> 02:33:57.860
I'll find it.

02:33:57.860 --> 02:33:58.860
Do you remember where I put it?

02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:00.780
It's one of the old pre-show things.

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:02.100
I have the pressure luck theme.

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:03.100
Play that.

02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:04.100
Alright, we're going to play the pressure luck theme.

02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:05.100
Okay.

02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:06.100
Alright.

02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:14.100
Listless here, it's the top holiday toys that we want and you should want for Christmas.

02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:19.100
This is the way it works for those of you that haven't sat in on a list list segment before, because we have some new listeners tonight.

02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:26.100
We're going to give Olive Hour in the room our top three items, and then we're going to go around the room and take...

02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:32.100
Each of us will take one item off of the list. That's going to be hard, because we're going to be crushing someone's Christmas dream right there.

02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:35.100
It's going to be very difficult tonight, very painful.

02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:40.100
Yeah, we'll just eliminate all low-keys like we do every week.

02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:44.540
and then once that's done you guys will vote on the final list you'll take your

02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:48.480
vote and you'll vote on what from that list is your most desired holiday toy

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:53.700
video game related it doesn't have to be new no just what you want this holiday

02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:59.620
season all right just what you want this holiday season and the thing that

02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:04.340
everybody should want this holiday season because you said so and you're gone okay

02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:06.660
got it

02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:13.660
all right and then uh... the chat room votes on the top three

02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:21.380
let's start

02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:25.380
number three

02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:30.380
I don't know why, I can't say this since I don't have a system anymore and I don't know why.

02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:37.380
I love the power glove. I'm so happy.

02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:44.380
Loki says everybody. Boys and girls everywhere need the Power Glove.

02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:51.380
Alright, let's move on. Brad, your number three choice.

02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:56.380
My number three choice is the PS1 with the combination with the LCD screen.

02:35:56.380 --> 02:36:00.380
I want this, I don't have one yet, but I think I want everybody else to get one.

02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:03.380
So I can mod it for you, for a very special price of course.

02:36:03.380 --> 02:36:08.380
Alright, a PS1 and LCD screen. Very good choice. Dave.

02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:19.380
Oh, um, an ignition pad, because it's the only actual pad that you can play DVR on. Unless you've got like some crazy mod thing on it.

02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:29.380
Alright, an ignition pad says Dave. I'll go ahead and get my number three pick. My number three pick this holiday season will let Rob once. I want The Sims Online.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:37.380
Because if you think Animal Crossing is bad, just fucking wait until Sims Online. That's all I have to say.

02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:39.380
Jamie, your number three pick.

02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:44.380
I want a PC Engine Duo RX. I have to explain this.

02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:45.380
Why?

02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:50.380
I already own a TurboGrafx Duo. The PC Engine was what TurboGrafx was in Japan.

02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:54.380
The advantage of having a duorax that has an arcade card built inside.

02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:59.380
I can actually play my copy of Strider, and, um, Art of...

02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:02.380
Not Art of Fighting 2, it's, uh, I think Real Boutville 3.

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:04.380
That's fuckin' hardcore.

02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:05.380
No, it's Art of Fighting 2. It's Art of Fighting 2.

02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:07.380
Jamie, you're so hardcore.

02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:09.380
I can't help that one.

02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:12.380
And the other thing, I can play Sapphire.

02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:18.380
Sapphire is such a fabulous game because it's one of the first 16-bit games that had real polygons in it.

02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:24.380
The chat room is suggesting, by the way, things such as a mail-order bride should be on the list.

02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:28.380
You guys have to remember, we're talking video game-related things.

02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:34.380
Video game? Do you think a mail-order bride? Yeah, I guess if you play video games, that's the only way you're ever going to get married, is by ordering one.

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:38.380
No, they can sit there and watch me play video games.

02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:42.380
Exceptions to every rule. Exceptions to every rule.

02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:45.380
I tease, I tease. Alright, moving on. Number two choice.

02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:49.380
My number two choice, I was going to go with now the uh,

02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:53.380
I had some of the hidden cameras in the center square there, but

02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:57.380
I decided no, probably shouldn't do that because I'd have no use for them.

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:01.380
I decided to go with the um, the official Konami

02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:05.380
Metal Stages, two of them.

02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:09.380
Every boy and girl wants a Konami Metal Stage, moving right along

02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:13.380
Brad, go to your chips.

02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:21.380
A GameCube with Animal Crossing in it.

02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:33.380
If you need a reason that GameCube already has the Animal Crossing CD, you win.

02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:35.880
So he wants a GameCube with Animal Crossing in it.

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:36.880
Alright.

02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:37.880
Okay.

02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:38.880
Fair enough.

02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.880
It didn't happen to me with a GameCube with an Animal Crossing in it.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.880
It happened with me with a Sega CDD and a Turtle Chain EX.

02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:50.380
Hardcore.

02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:51.880
I mean, you bought it that way.

02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.880
Alright Dave, your number two choice.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:57.380
Um, my number two choice is a DD-REX machine.

02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:00.380
I'm sorry, a DD-REX machine?

02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:01.380
Yes.

02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:02.880
What is that?

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:03.880
uh...

02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:05.160
stream all my back

02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.040
well i don't know the legal yet upset i'm not down with it

02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:11.800
that i'm not doing that with the legal my bad

02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:13.720
you're right

02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.440
all right uh...

02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:16.920
by uh... never to pick

02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:19.360
for must-have this holiday season

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:21.960
it's star on that

02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:25.440
and have to have the body

02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:29.960
as a gift

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:32.400
jimmy your number to pick

02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:35.980
It was almost my number one pick, but I had to think of my priorities.

02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:40.360
I want a BeatMania 2D X Arcade style controller.

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:45.360
I had my chance to get one, I had the thing ordered, we had everything together.

02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:52.360
Your credit card's not the right kind, you can't accept it, so we're canceling your order.

02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:59.720
So it still has to do with it being a Japanese card, it has to have some type of association or something, so mine didn't have it.

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:01.640
have it

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:05.820

02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:57.820

If you say the 2DX machine, we're all set.

02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:03.820
Wait, actually, Loki said 2DX.

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:08.820
Okay, you say 2DX, I say a JPS2 with 2DX in the controller.

02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:12.820
There we go.

02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:14.820
Good lord, all right, fine.

02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:16.820
Throw in a memory card. Fair enough.

02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:19.820
I think we have it all worked out now, geez.

02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:21.820
All right, my number one pick.

02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:24.820

My number one pick, Yes I'm Trendy, Fuck You, Metroid Prime!

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:46.820
I hate first person shooters and this game is fabulous.

02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:49.820

02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:34.540
mania.

02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:35.540
Wow.

02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:40.300
I don't know how we're going to possibly do the elimination round, but, oh well, Christmases

02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:42.940
are about to be ruined here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:42.940 --> 02:42:47.500
I don't know how people are expecting to pay for all this shit.

02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:49.980
Everything that I picked is in excess of $200.

02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:54.460
So I don't know, I guess you're going to vote for the thing you least would want to see

02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:55.460
under your tree.

02:42:55.460 --> 02:43:00.780
I have no idea how you're going to make a selection here, but just fucking do it.

02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:03.900
Or your menorah, as the case may be.

02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:06.380
Okay, in the back in the peanut gallery, Neil's asking...

02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:14.380
You get eight days of presents, so you get your 2DX machine in pieces.

02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:17.380
Here's the monitor! Here's the key!

02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:21.380
Actually, I got fucking jibbed this Hanukkah. All I got was a DVR max.

02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:29.380
But, hopefully, because my birthday comes a day after Christmas, so normally they make up for it with the better shit on my birthday.

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.380
Yeah, you got your priorities in order, you know.

02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:34.380
Good little Jewish boy.

02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:36.380
What the hell are you talking about?

02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:39.380
Christmas and Hanukkah are all about presents.

02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:42.380
Yeah, they're about presents.

02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:45.380
They're about Jesus, or not.

02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:48.380
Anyway.

02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:51.380
Can we finish? Can we finish? Can we finish?

02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:56.380
Here we go. Loki, ruin someone's Christmas right now.

02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:58.380
What don't you want for Christmas?

02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:01.380
Well, since I don't play it at all.

02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:03.380
A 2DX machine.

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:06.580
2DX machine going straight for the gut

02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:12.780
He's just gonna play when it's candy whenever it arrives all right Brad

02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:18.660
It's time for you to ruin Christmas and Hanukkah for somebody's for that man power gloves say goodbye

02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:23.780
Oh, oh, no you didn't know you did not take on the power glove and it sucks

02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:27.020
Okay, the chat room

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:33.660
The chat room will have your head for that Brad okay my turn Dave's turn metal stages metal stages

02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:36.060
Fuck you, Loki

02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:40.460
Where the hell was that oh, yes the Konami metal stages there it is

02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:45.340
All right, I would purposely go out of stages come on

02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:51.700
Take off the jps2, but that was my number two choice if you I thought that oh never mind

02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:53.700
That was going to be one of my choices.

02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:56.700
My number one to come off the list, um...

02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:00.700
Oh God, um...

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.700
I'm gonna take off the PS1 LCD screen.

02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:05.700
Because...

02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:11.700
I'm taking that off because the PS1 is so last year.

02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:17.700
You know what? I'm looking at this list, and I own probably most of the stuff that's on it already.

02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:19.700
Um, so...

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:22.700
You don't own an EX machine.

02:45:22.700 --> 02:45:24.700
I said most of this stuff, not all of it.

02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:25.700
Alright, alright.

02:45:25.700 --> 02:45:29.700
Because I have a JPS2, an American PS2, a Metroid Prime, and a GameCube and Animal Crossing.

02:45:29.700 --> 02:45:30.700
And...

02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:31.700
Toot the little horn.

02:45:31.700 --> 02:45:34.700
I have... and I actually have a beta of Sims Online.

02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:35.700
So...

02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:39.700
Let's take off...

02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:40.700
No worries.

02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:45.700
Sorry Rob, we'll take off Sims Online.

02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:46.700
Oh, you suck.

02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:47.700
I hate you.

02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:48.700
Alright, I forgive you.

02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:49.700
Alright.

02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:50.700
I prefer not to be lagged.

02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:51.700
Thank you.

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:52.940
Sims Online is off the list.

02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:56.900
So, the final list that now our chat room is going to vote for their number one.

02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:59.260
You only vote for one of these.

02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:02.300
Jamie, why don't you read off the final list here.

02:46:02.300 --> 02:46:06.020
Oh wait, I've got to make sure this copied right and not some porn site or something

02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.460
is going to post all over the chat room.

02:46:07.460 --> 02:46:09.900
I've got to make sure, you know, I can't pay for that to happen.

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:10.900
Can't tag porn.

02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:13.260
Alright, why don't you read off this list, Jamie, and they can vote for it right now

02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.260
in the chat room.

02:46:14.260 --> 02:46:17.260
No, but pimp tricks are for hoes.

02:46:17.260 --> 02:46:20.580
We have an ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX.

02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:21.580
How did that stay?

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:25.460
Because it's the coolest video game system ever.

02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:29.020
You can play Dracula X on it, okay?

02:46:29.020 --> 02:46:33.900
GameCube with Animal Crossing, DDR Extreme, Phantasy Star Online, and of course you have

02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:38.740
to have the adapter with it, 2DX arcade style controller, it would help find connections.

02:46:38.740 --> 02:46:39.740
Sorry.

02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:44.260
Japanese PS2, American PS2, Metroid Prime, and Germania controller with Germania, because

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:45.260
they came...

02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:46.260
What?

02:46:46.260 --> 02:46:51.260
Fabulous. So, a quick, quick music break while you guys send in your votes.

02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:53.260
You're only gonna have, like, two minutes to send me your votes.

02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:55.260
So do it now. Now, now, now!

02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:58.260
You can send them in over email as well, but hurry up and do it now.

02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.260
Vote for your favorite, and we will be right back.

02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:05.260
We're gonna play something from Guitar Freaks and DrumMania. What?

02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:08.260
The bump? I don't know if I have the bump cued up. I'm sorry.

02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:10.260
How about something from Guitar Freaks and DrumMania?

02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:11.260
Something there? Catch your eye?

02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:12.260
Monkey Magic.

02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:13.260
Monkey Magic.

02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:15.260
And then we'll hear Kijaka.

02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:20.260
And then we'll come right back. So that gives you two minutes to vote here on Orange Line Radio.

02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:49.260
He knew every magic trick under the sun

02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:53.260
He'd forgotten everybody and had some fun

02:47:54.260 --> 02:47:57.260
Monkey magic, monkey magic

02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:01.260
Monkey magic, monkey magic

02:48:05.260 --> 02:48:09.260
Have a little bit of monkey magic

02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:13.260
Kiss you by your western eye

02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:20.260
There's a little little monkey in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky

02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:29.260
One sunny day on the mountain top

02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:33.260
The monkey is the monkey that ever stopped

02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:37.260
He knew every last thing under the sun

02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:42.260
The Jesus gods and everyone had some fun

02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:58.260
Monkey Magic

02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:49.260
The real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:52.980
You are listening to Orange Launch Radio. We're right in the middle of listless

02:50:52.980 --> 02:50:57.580
the topic tonight, the top thing we want most for Christmas

02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:01.780
or Hanukkah, whatever you happen to celebrate. And if you were a little kid

02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:06.840
being sampled by the Hooligans website, the number one pick for them was a Game Boy Advance,

02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:09.780
which didn't even make our list.

02:51:09.780 --> 02:51:11.180
You know it's not going to be there.

02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:12.980
It means we probably already have one.

02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:15.060
Well, once again, these were the final choices.

02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:19.180
An ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX, a GameCube and Animal

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:23.500
Crossing, a DDR Extreme machine, which is a miracle,

02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:25.380
because it's not even out till next year.

02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:29.060
But I'm just going to assume you're talking about a beta.

02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:34.100
Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX controller arcade style,

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:37.800
Japanese PS2 and American PS2, Metroid Prime,

02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:40.920
and a drum mania controller and drum mania.

02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:42.200
I just want to say it's the holidays.

02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:45.160
Miracles happen this time around, you know?

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:46.560
Miracles do happen.

02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:47.120
Thank you.

02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:49.840
Thank you, Preachy Dave.

02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:51.840
We appreciate that.

02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:53.040
OK.

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:56.920
Let's read the top ones.

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:59.200
I was trying to find a sound effect file,

02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:07.760
but I don't have one, so let's do this one.

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:10.760
Okay, the winners are...

02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:14.760
Boy Ren, if you think you're happy now, wait till you hear this!

02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:17.760
It's a record of my favorite song!

02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:20.760
Yes, you get the Happy Happy Joy Joy song.

02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:23.760
Happy Happy Joy Joy!

02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:29.760
Hello, boys and girls.

02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:32.760
This is your old pal, Stinky Whizzledee.

02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:35.760
The number three winner, Happy Happy Joy Joy,

02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:39.760
This is a GameCube and Animal Crossing!

02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:43.760
Yay! GameCube and Animal Crossing win.

02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:47.760
Third place, second place winner is

02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:51.760
a Judy X arcade style controller.

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:55.760
Why wouldn't he just want the rather

02:52:55.760 --> 02:52:59.760
if Loki hadn't put it off.

02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:03.760
Hey, that's the way it works.

02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:14.760
And the winner of Buy a Landslide might I add, I don't know why, because it ain't even out yet, but hey, nobody gave the chat room points for being smurt.

02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:24.760
Just kidding. We love our chatters, and they did pick a DDR Extreme machine as the number one must-have holiday present thing.

02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:27.760
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy!

02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:30.760
If we knew it, the granddaddy of all luck

02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:04.760
the game did not garner enough... It doesn't count because it wasn't on our list. Sheesh.

02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:10.480
Yeah. Deal with it. We'll do another list list for my voice later. Every day is a game

02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:16.800
with Rob. Oh, they're saying that Sky's voice the game would be like Parappa the game. Kick

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:22.840
punch, it's all in the mind. Or something, like my... In the rain or in the snow, I got

02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:28.720
the funky flow. That means he has to pee. He got the funky flow from eating too much

02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:35.360
beans. Oh, dear good lord. Alright, it's about time to end the show. Believe it or not, we've

02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:40.600
made it for three hours. Oh, shit, we gotta do Loki's sim update. My bad. My bad. Way

02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:44.360
to go there, Rob. Ah, shit, I thought we could get through one show without it. No, I'm kidding,

02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:47.520
I'm kidding. Yes, give us your sim update, Loki. Make it quick. Alright. Not too much

02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:52.200
going on. We've got DWI, new version now, I believe they're up at the like 3-2 or something.

02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:55.520
Oh, who cares, it doesn't really matter. The whole point is that they have...

02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:01.720
Karaoke now is the lyrics from 3rd Mix you were talking about earlier. That is now featured

02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:06.520
in DWI. Oh shit. And so people are actually, you know, making lyrics for songs and that

02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:11.440
wonderful stuff. And also they have the addition for special characters, you know, like the

02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:16.720
hearts and Japanese characters and stuff. They have that available now free. So go check

02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:28.720
Also, for all you Bimani Ruler DWI fans out there, on DDR Mania X, you'll probably see a post in the user-submitted files saying something about a share DWI.

02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:39.720
Well, guess what? That's not share, that is the return, the last final Bimani Ruler unreleased track that you need to go download, because it's supposed to be good, but I tried it and it's just four-key beatmania.

02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:41.720
But anyways, have fun with that.

02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:47.720
So yeah, also, Turning Mix 3 is going to be, you know, enter that if you haven't yet.

02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:49.720
And it'll be fun.

02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:51.720
They should be posting up files probably at the end of December.

02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:54.720
How about Make Edit, Get Porn? Give us an update on Make Edit, Get Porn.

02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.720
Well, I haven't really kind of come up with a date yet.

02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.720
I'm wondering more stuff to go in the boxes.

02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:03.720
So yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on there.

02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:07.720
So I'll announce a date when we do have one.

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:14.720
Aside from that, really not too much going on. Just check out DDRUK. Do donate the money because they're kind of short on money.

02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:21.720
But they do have the Dancing Stage, Party Edition files up, and also pretty much almost everything else official-wise.

02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:24.720
So go check it out. They have sync sets for you to download.

02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:26.720
So, yeah. That's it.

02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:28.720
Oh! Oh! Oh! And one more thing.

02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:36.720
Now, it's my understanding, and I'm not really sure about the Naoki Journal because I can't read Japanese, but I believe that this is the last one.

02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:41.000
well I cry yeah next

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.440
that Jamie oh yeah I guess it's time that time to give our final thoughts

02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:47.420
tonight Jamie

02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:51.780
and just one little thing I got BMX triple x for free

02:56:51.780 --> 02:56:56.020
and it sucks but you can pick up the whole integrity or pimp

02:56:56.020 --> 02:57:00.260
but that's all and for that it's worth buying

02:57:00.260 --> 02:57:04.420
no you're getting it for free low key your final thought please

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:13.420
If you get sci-fi, tomorrow night at 9 p.m. is the first of ten two-hour-long mini-movies of Taken.

02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:23.420
It's one of the most awesome series. It's produced by C.N. Spielberg, directed by ten different people. It's going to be really awesome. Definitely check it out.

02:57:23.420 --> 02:57:26.420
Alright, we'll duel just for you, Loki.

02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:29.420
Okay, um, I just found my Koosh thing.

02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:30.420
Dave, yes, you're fine alone.

02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:41.420
Yeah, I've had it, like, I brought it over here, I think, two months ago, and left it here, and I was wondering where it was, and then, hey, that guy, I figured his name was playing with it.

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:42.420
No, that guy.

02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:43.420
That guy Brad?

02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:44.420
No.

02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:46.420
That guy Brad, or that guy, uh, Neil?

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:47.420
Yeah.

02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:48.420
Yes.

02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:49.420
Yeah, him.

02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:50.420
Yeah, all right.

02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:54.420

Bradley, your final thought, please.

02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:26.980
That thing is a copy of an Aerobee that I used to have on those things.

02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:27.980
An Aerobee.

02:58:27.980 --> 02:58:29.980
It's like harder than that.

02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:32.980
Especially the thing that you throw the farthest.

02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:35.980
Yeah, because now toys are supposed to be non-lethal.

02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:36.980
Yeah.

02:58:36.980 --> 02:58:42.980
Well, anyway, now that the show is over, the streets are now, once again, safe for Balani.

02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:45.980
Hooray.

02:58:45.980 --> 02:58:48.260
Whoa, to the Republic.

02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:52.820
My final thought is that my voice is not high and funny, it is deep and sexy.

02:58:52.820 --> 02:58:55.240
It's high in fiber.

02:58:55.240 --> 02:58:56.240
And I need to get...

02:58:56.240 --> 02:58:58.460
Rob's voice is high in fiber and fortified with vitamins.

02:58:58.460 --> 02:58:59.780
And I need to get laid.

02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:00.780
And that's it.

02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:01.780
Whale!

02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:02.780
Wasn't that special?

02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:04.980
I really, really, really need to get laid.

02:59:04.980 --> 02:59:05.980
That's it.

02:59:05.980 --> 02:59:06.980
Good night.

02:59:06.980 --> 02:59:07.980
See you next week.

02:59:07.980 --> 02:59:08.980
Remember, we're pre-taped next week.

02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:12.540
If you missed the message earlier in the show, we'll be doing it live on Saturday, but for

02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:16.900
For those who can't join us Saturday, we'll be rebroadcasting at the normal time on Sunday,

02:59:16.900 --> 02:59:21.580

02:59:21.580 --> 02:59:26.260
place, so all your old episodes, you can catch up on them next weekend.

02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:02.060
This is the triforce of wisdom, Link.

03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:05.060
It's evil wizard Ganon has the triforce of power.

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:15.060
