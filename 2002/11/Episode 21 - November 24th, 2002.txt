Message for you, son!
Attention!
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
In this episode...
Hey, any balls down there?
That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Showgirls.
Absolutely frightful.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty.
And your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gay...
DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
It's the bush baby.
Say hello also to our third wheel.
It's our tech master, Loki.
Hey, everybody.
And also in studio tonight, we have another few guests to say hello to.
Everybody say hello to... Who's got a microphone?
Say hello to Bradley over there.
Yo.
Yo.
What's up, my brother?
Also in studio, say hello to... Is it Jenny's bitch or is it Jamie's bitch?
We don't know, but the initials are JB.
JB.
That's all you want to say is hello?
Moo.
Moo, okay.
We'll be talking to everybody more a bit later.
We're just going to take a really quick break.
Any other opening thoughts from you folks here?
You know, I don't think the parrot noises pick up very well over the radio, actually.
I don't know, though.
You can hear a little bit of it?
I don't know, I don't listen to the show.
Oh, we have a brand.
Oh, oh.
Oh, you know what?
Everybody who listens at home, give me food.
You want food right now.
What were you craving before the show started?
Artichoke hearts.
I want a pizza with garlic sauce and artichoke hearts.
Is that a PMS thing?
Oh, bite me.
All right, we'll be right back after this very quick break.
I would like our listeners to know that Robin's eating balls.
They're big and fluffy.
Before we get into the next song, I'd like to make a real quick announcement.
Kind of tease our next segment.
Rob was eating balls.
Well, other than that, I was eating balls.
I'd like to announce that after these next two songs, when we come back to the next segment, I'm going to come out live on air.
It's time for me to come out of the closet, and I will be doing that live on air just after this next break.
So, just, you know, this is going to be historic radio right here.
We just want to let you all know.
You and I, in a little toy shop, buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got Set them free at the break of dawn, till one by one, they were gone Back of phase, box in the software, flash the message, something's out there Floating in the summer sky, 99, every day
99 dreams I have had, everyone a red balloon It's all over and I'm standing pretty, in this dust that was a city If I could find a souvenir, just to prove the world was here And here is a red balloon, I'll think of you and let it go
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
That's right.
As we promised during the last break, it's time for me to stop hiding secrets from everyone here assembled in the room and all those assembled in the chat room.
I need to stop lying to myself about some things.
I have to admit this live on air.
I like something that a lot of people say I shouldn't like.
and people are telling me it's wrong that I feel this way and that I like these kinds of things, but I have to say, you guys, I just can't get enough of it.
I really do like Politary's dive from Six Style.
There, I said it.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, mom and dad.
I'm so sorry.
I hate her.
I wish she would burn in hell.
In fact, it still holds true, okay?
You don't know that all Apolitary fans are going to burn in hell.
Who are you to judge?
Don't judge me.
You don't know me.
I'm still holding a bounty for her dead.
Bring her head to me and you'll be paid with vast riches of the lands.
You don't know shit.
Ah, there.
I feel much better now that I've come out on radio.
That was so invigorating.
Thank you.
Oh, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
No, you're not.
You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.
Episode 21.
You're listening to All Apolitary all the time.
Before your ears bleed.
And that does make me sad.
That makes me sad.
Because I'm sorry, that is the best version of Dive.
Go have a cry.
Yeah, I will have a cry.
I'm going to go have a cry.
The B4U girls can sing better than her.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
She cannot hold a key.
Neither can the B4U.
Yes, I can.
Which would make Super Eurobeat that much better.
That's my impression of B4U.
Hyper Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat.
It's got B4U and Politary.
What more evil do you need?
I'm sorry, are you going to say that to Mike?
JB's afraid of microphones.
We're not going to hear very much from him this show.
What are you doing here?
So, yeah, I was playing Dive just the other day on 2DX and I was like, you know what?
I like this song and the hell with the rest of you.
I don't like Politary either, but, you know, everybody's allowed one odd thing.
She needs to have a hello again moment.
Choke on a chicken ball.
And die!
You guys are so mean.
No, we're not.
We're being honest.
So... Totally so.
The show is sponsored by Propel
Okay, sim update.
Well, we can do that.
Let's see, obviously the most prominent thing going on right now is Herney Mix 3.
Entries are actually being accepted right now and until December 20th, so get your stuff in there.
No, I actually played Step Mania for the first time outside of your simulator, because I've played your simulator at various parties that you've been at and you brought it to.
Outside of your simulator, I actually sat down, I downloaded Stepmania, and I actually played it for the first time in I don't know how long.
And, you know what?
It's pretty damn cool.
I don't know what I've been missing out on.
Yeah.
But, um... Okay.
Anyways, yeah, actually, one of the things that's going to be coming up pretty soon in some of the updates for Setmania is support for Beatmania.
So that's going to be good.
So you're going to see support for Beatmania probably soon after will be Dance Maniacs and Poppin' Music.
And they'll be the all-encompassing Bimani Sim.
The word for that?
Squee!
So, look for that soon.
Other things that should be noted, visit DDRUK.
I mean, they've got tons of sync sets that they're releasing now.
They have pretty much everything.
They're doing some of the older 1 through 5 mix stuff, so go check that out.
Also, check out, I believe, in the DDR Maniacs chatroom, they're going to be hosting files.
They have 1zip, that's all the Monty Ruler stuff that he released in 2002.
Oh, they love us there, right?
If I remember that right?
Yeah, they love us there.
Big fans!
Big fans.
Yeah, big, big, huge fans.
So, just go check that out, because they've got, you know, his, all of his stuff for 2002, including the unreleased stuff, which I have, it's supposed to be in there in one huge zip, 111 megs, I believe.
Wait, this is Bomani Roller?
Bomani Roller.
I thought you didn't give a shit about that stuff.
I don't give a shit.
Because you just ranted a couple weeks ago about the whole diva thing.
I don't give a shit about his stuff, but other people might.
Other people might.
Alright, alright.
So, there's that.
Also out there floating around somewhere is the DDR Extreme skin for Step Mania, so go find that somewhere.
It's supposed to be, I guess... It's out there somewhere.
It's out there somewhere.
I don't know where.
Just go check that out.
But yeah, Tourney Mix 3 for sure is going to be... Definitely keep your eye on that.
They've got a bunch of categories, including one now that you actually have to pay to get into for those people that are really professional at making files.
I'm actually considering entering.
I'm not sure yet.
Now, you saw that I did my very first step file.
Yes.
My very first one.
You got to see it.
You know what's sad?
I mean, let's just put it this way.
I have to say your step file is the most synced step file I've ever seen.
Every time I play that, I get triple A.
I guess that's a good thing
It looks like the guy who wrote it is Raiden, I thought it was always spelled the other way around, but the real name is Steven Unfred, wrote this file about how to sync a DWI, well actually he's talking about DWI, not Stepmania, but it was very helpful for me to sync this file that I did.
So it was, you know, you had to go into Gold Wave, you had to count the beats and do a little math, but this thing kind of walks you through it, the logic and everything, and it was very helpful.
So props to this guy for writing the file, because that really helped me in syncing that.
Yeah, really sync.
Oh yeah, I will copy, yes, for those of you in our chat room, and if you're not in our chat room, why the hell aren't you?
You should get your booty on over to orangelounge.skie.cx, and then just click on chat.
And then that'll get you in our chat room, and for those in the chat room, I posted the link right there.
And aren't you lucky you're there.
See, other stuff that's going on right now.
See, well, it's not really, I guess, simulator related, but it is a pretty big thing.
DDRspot.com is relaunched.
So, you know, we'll definitely go check that out.
The site is beautiful.
We'll talk a little more about that stuff later.
And finally...
I don't know how to exactly describe this, but DDRPC character set 9 is released in... Okay, just spit it out, Loki.
Two new characters is Betty and Mr. Spanky.
Mr. Spanky, the DDR guy.
Mr. Spanky, the bondage queen.
This guy, I mean, what the hell are they thinking?
What is this?
I mean, they've got this guy who's like, he's in all leather, like straps, okay?
He's got a mohawk and big, like, huge lips full of lipstick.
Mr. Spanky.
And then you've got the chick, she's in all, like, leather and stuff with, like, horns in her hair.
I mean, that's some scary shit.
I'm trying to find the DDRPC site right now so we can bring it up.
Hey, what kind of sick fucks work at Konami of America?
That's all I gotta say.
Really sick people there.
I'm trying to find the DDR.
Sorry, you guys.
There it is.
Dance Dance Revolution product site.
And downloads.
And character downloads, because that's all they actually released.
They were too lazy to release songs.
That's okay.
Yeah, Jason Enos and Mr. Spanky.
The white man always smiting out the black man.
Did you notice that?
Look at that.
They also edited set number seven to remove the skull from Robbie and put this stupid, like, I don't even know what kind of head it is.
Why did they do that?
They have to edit the skull thing, but yet they have Mr. Spanky.
Well, we know where their focus lies in freaking Bondage Freaks.
Because those aren't the first ones that they've released that were Bondage Freaks.
You've got Kobe and Nikki who look pretty Kobe-ish.
But yeah, it's a sad day, but I don't know.
What can you do?
I mean...
Maybe we'll talk to Mr. Spanky later in the program.
Maybe Mr. Spanky can offer us some advice.
I think Mr. Spanky's a big fan of Orange Lounge Radio, actually, from what I hear.
So we'll talk to Mr. Spanky a little bit later.
Maybe Mr. Spanky will just kind of pop in during one of our breaks and offer you all some good advice.
Because Lord knows a lot of you nerds out there could use it.
Back on the subject of Tourney Mix 3, Rob's file there, he sent it over to me, and I decided to go ahead and do a background for him.
I actually like it.
It looks pretty cool.
It's very colorful now.
Which one?
The background for your song.
Oh, yes.
You did a very excellent job with that background.
I'll actually play the song I did in Etitude starting the next break, so everybody can hear it.
And I'm still working on it.
Although I'm not entering Tourney Mix 3 with that.
I'm still debating if I even want to enter it at all, because I'm shy.
Do it anyways, just do it in light if you're going to do it.
I mean, that's cool.
And I'm entering mine in Alien World.
I'm working on the subs actually right now.
So, it'll be cool.
Very cool.
Are you looking at something pretty, Jamie?
There was a piece of lint floating in the air and I cut it.
You really care about the Sim update, don't you?
Um, yeah.
I, the, what, the Sims?
Are you talking about Animal Crossing?
No.
Also, I'll be announcing this later on, something that has to do with my sim.
And a further evolution of my sim, we'll get into that later on.
Alright, so, sim stuff.
Yeah, so you are going to be entering Tournament Mix 3.
I'm debating it.
Jamie doesn't really play the sim, so you probably won't be entering Tournament Mix 3.
Gatchamanota
No, you could do a dance file to Schlagwerk, because nobody's ever done one.
Oh, really?
My bad.
Both the Terror and the regular one.
My bad, my bad.
I would pick one of the old, like the Mega Ranger theme song, if I had to.
Oh, we have a new person in our chat room that says that they also have this ferret.
Brack2000 also owns the infamous ferret that we like to play here on the show.
Jamie likes to stroke it here on the show.
I'm sorry, JB?
Bush Baby.
Bush Baby.
It just had a fun time.
Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you'd want to hear that wonderful news that Bush Baby has a twin.
Bush Baby has a twin.
It's Robzo.
I just play with it.
It was a present.
I also ended up in somebody's lap here while he was quite drunk.
What?
No, what?
What?
Oh.
We need to do another drunk show.
We really need to.
You know, we're going to have to pre-tape a show.
So I'm thinking we ought to pre-tape a drunk show at some point.
That sounds like a winner.
That might be a winner because I'm actually going to be gone the week between Christmas and New Year's.
So we'll probably do some kind of pre-tape drunk show.
What more appropriate time than the holidays to be doing a drunk show?
Oh, right.
So we'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
That's nice, twin.
Yay.
Hooray.
You're special.
Go shave your hands.
Let's see.
What else should we talk about here?
Let's talk about... No, we're not going to talk about J-Rom.
Let's talk about... Since this kind of goes along with the whole Sim thing, and Loki was alluding to this a little bit ago, there's a brand new version of DDR out there that you may not have heard of.
Because it's not official.
It's quite a bootleg.
But I know you all out there have always wanted to dance to Britney Spears.
And you've always wanted to dance to Eminem and Christina Aguilera.
I feel sorry for you people.
Loki, tell us more about DDR Top Hits.
It's a piece of crap that they, you know, made very...
I don't know.
They didn't really put much work into it, it looks like.
It's basically a hacked fourth mix upgrade that they made, and it's crap.
They just replaced the images and replaced the songs.
It doesn't even look like they even touched the steps at all.
So, it's a piece of crap.
It's got, like, Christina Aguilera in it, Britney Spears.
That makes it a piece of crap instantly.
It's just sad.
Very, very sad.
I see No Doubt.
I wonder if that's old school No Doubt or new school No Doubt.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Who knows?
Who cares?
It's just, it's crap.
It's, what they, now, on the actual website, ddrtophits.com, you can actually see they have screenshots there, and if you look really closely on one of them where it shows the song selection screen, you'll actually see one of the songs that's, I believe, Boyz by Britney Spears, it says 1-2-3-4-0-0-7 as the actual song title.
because they're dumbasses and don't know actually how to hack the stupid thing.
It says boys.
And it also has the Dance Mania banner, might I add.
So doesn't this look like a bad Photoshop job to anybody else?
No, actually, that's what I was alluding to earlier.
I was talking with our fellow DDR tech guy, Keith, down in Scandia, and they were actually, sadly enough, talking about upgrading their fourth mix to this piece of shit.
So I talked them out of it.
I was like, I was like, I thought, hell no.
So what we're going to do, and actually next week, Keith is making me copies of the Flash ROM, the game CD and the install CD, and I'm going to hack a Max 2 machine, and we're going to make my own custom mix in the arcade.
Now, how pompous and cocky of you to be saying that you're going to be able to accomplish this.
Do you really think you're going to be able to get in there and hack all the data?
Why hasn't it been done yet?
If it's possible to do, why hasn't somebody else done it yet?
Why haven't the Japs done it?
The Japs always do it first.
Well, for one, over here in America, all these machines are illegal.
So really, there's nothing they can do about the fact that I hacked a fucking machine.
What are they going to say?
Oh, this music's not supposed to be on here.
Well, because it's not licensed.
Well, neither is any of the music that's on any of the import machines, so there's nothing really they can do.
Suck my dick!
Exactly.
So there's nothing that they can really do as far as that.
Now, hacking a machine is slightly complicated, but it can be done.
Now, there's a song you should put on there.
Why you gotta go and make things so complicated?
No.
Anyways.
But it can be done.
I mean, look right here.
We can definitely see that images and music is a piece of cake to do.
And the actual game data itself, the actual program, is only like 30 megs.
It's all on a flash ROM.
A flash card, actually.
Just a normal 32 meg flash card.
And it's pretty easy.
Plus, he's also having a few friends of his who are, you know, crackers and that kind of stuff.
Now, I'm not talking about white guys.
I'm talking about actually people that crack software.
They're going to be, you know, doing the same thing.
So, no looking at it.
I really think it shouldn't be too hard since, you know, my knowledge of making edits and that kind of stuff and actually working with just reverse engineering all this shit to do it.
Sure, it will take time.
I need to actually look at the game CD and stuff to figure out how the stuff's stored and that kind of junk, but I think we can do it.
So this is your new project?
This is my new project.
Your new time waster.
My new time waster, yes.
But at the same time, other cool stuff that I'll be able to do with these game CDs that he's given me is rip all the videos for Mac 2.
Everyone's been trying to do that, ripping the videos off of DDR USA, but I'm actually just going to rip them off of Mac 2.
What I'm planning to do is actually reskin the whole thing
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
We were just throwing around a bunch of ideas because actually, for instance, people would think, okay, there's limitations on what you can put on one of those things since it's all stored on CD.
Well, not exactly because you can replace the CD-ROM drives with hard drives and then you can just stick, oh, look, 120 gigs worth of stuff on there.
You can actually have a DDR mix with everything on it.
So it can be done.
Loki makes Konami cry.
Oh, yeah.
Well, see, Konami would be the only one to get pissed about this stuff, or the RIA, but then all they'd have to do is they'd have to remove every machine in the United States, which... So you could possibly be fucking it up for everybody.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Hello.
I'm fucking up for everybody.
I'm not selling my fucking mix on the internet for $1,495.
Yeah, I'm not selling.
This is going to be exclusive to Scandia.
Okay?
This is exclusive to Scandia.
So there's only going to be one... So if you're out there listening to me, you know exactly where to come and arrest Loki.
Hey, okay.
Just because I make the thing doesn't mean I'm responsible for it.
That's like trying to sue the gun manufacturer for a murder.
I mean...
Just because I make it doesn't mean I'm assuming the risk for actually running it in an actual arcade.
This is all scandia, so if things go down, they're going down, not me.
Loki's going to ruin DDR.
Loki's going to ruin DDR.
Yeah, but guess what?
Another thing is I will be able to get copies of all these game CDs and stuff.
I have the hookups, basically.
And so right when we get extreme, too, same thing with that.
So...
Well, I need to figure out now the really tough thing.
What the hell do I put in it?
You should just copy your sim over.
A lot of shit.
No, screw that.
We'll advise you on what songs need to be in there.
Okay, but here's another thing that we're also going to, since it is going to be a Max 2 machine, I'm going to have unlocks in there.
I'm not going to tell anyone what's going to be unlocked.
Let me put it this way.
It's going to be a lot of points, a lot of songs unlocked each time.
I'm going to have also custom monies.
Maybe, I'm thinking, you know, what it's looking like is probably going to be DDR USA stuff, or Max USA stuff, I should say, and Euromix 2 and Euromix 1 stuff.
and Jenny Rome, I guess, and Beat Mania.
Well, I mean, I can talk, you know, this stuff.
I have to actually get into looking at it.
Well, but the first step you've got to figure out, you've got to be able to replace, like, at first you've got to go, like, you start little baby steps.
Okay, I'm going to replace one song.
I'm going to see if I can replace one song.
We need DDR 2DX style.
That'd be cool.
You need to go, and then he'll go and start ripping the 2DX discs.
That'll be his next project.
Well, I mean, it sounds like a major undertaking, but I think if I can pull it off,
Other than the fact that it'd be really cool because we'd be the only arcade in the United States that have custom mix.
Ah, decent question from the chatroom.
If you can hack an arcade version, why haven't you hacked a PlayStation version yet?
Or a Dreamcast version?
I haven't even tried.
Well, here's the thing.
People have hacked the Dreamcast version, by the way.
And actually, they're a little different from each other.
I mean, the arcade versions, they actually store the music on a CD a little bit different than they would, you know, an actual...
The arcade versions and the PlayStation versions are, like I said, very different.
There's a lot of things you can change on an arcade version that you can't change on a PlayStation version.
I just think just the way they store the data is going to be a little different, too.
Sure, I guess we could try hacking a PlayStation version, but I'd rather do the arcade.
The Dreamcast ones will be easier to do though because it's more compatible with the Windows environment.
Yeah, it's Windows CE.
No, they're not running Windows CE, but they're more compatible.
The thing about Dreamcast games is that they're not running in Windows CE unless they boot up Windows CE at the beginning of the game because it's actually loading Windows onto the Dreamcast every time you boot the game.
Yeah, but I don't know.
We're going to look at it.
I'll see how feasible it is.
I'm getting copies of 4th Mixed Stuff and Max 2, so we'll go from there.
Sounds like fun.
All I ask, you need to put... Oh, Nick, please not so quick back in DVR.
Don't worry.
I was going to bring back everything, including Telephone Operator, because I love that song, and they didn't bring it back, so...
I like it just because it's a lot like the original.
Are you okay?
Jamie has a medical emergency.
But, yeah, that's an idea.
I mean, we'll see how hard it is, and when I get done with it, you know, we'll see.
I think it can be done.
I don't think it's going to be too difficult.
These idiots can make one.
I mean, obviously, they didn't go into great detail of actually hacking the program and changing some of the steps or anything, but, you know, never know.
It shouldn't be too difficult.
Let's see, we're looking... Are you going to be okay there, Jim?
Oh.
Bike it in!
Hooray.
So what else... What do you guys... The other folks here in the chatroom, what do you guys think... Or the... Not in the chatroom.
Well, if chatroom wants to share too, that's fine.
But what do you guys here in the room think about this DDR Top Hits?
Your guys' opinions.
Like...
It makes me want to throw up.
It's going to suck.
Look at the fucking banner for just the beginning there.
It's like blue.
They probably don't have any artists.
They're probably a bunch of programming nerds.
They have no art people.
I just think they're stupid and don't know jack about they just threw this shit together.
You think if you're gonna sell something, at least make it look good.
I mean, I don't know.
I could do a way better job than them, that's all.
Black Lab's calling this DDR Mishits.
No, I'll name it something.
It's the Total Request Live version of DDR.
I'm talking about Topic 2.
It's like, okay, what do you want to see in DDR?
Okay, well, people obviously have said V before.
Oh, well, the steps for V suck.
You should just call it DDR that doesn't suck.
DDR that doesn't suck.
No, I was going to call it maybe like DDR Unauthorized or some shit like that, I don't know.
Redband DDR, Porno DDR, no, I guess you can't have that.
DDR XXXtreme.
DDR XXXtreme.
We'll even put Max the XXXium in there just for the hell of it.
Put like a song called that.
We could put crazy stuff in there.
This DDR sucks.
I don't know.
Well, we just have to see, you know, how feasible this is.
Can I be the new announcer?
Can we hack the announcer voice, too?
I want to be the announcer.
Actually, you can.
We can hack the announcer voice.
I don't really... I was just thinking about using just, you know, what's in there right now.
Obviously, we can probably steal the stuff from, you know, Solo or whatever.
Warning!
This game causes cancer!
We need the squirrel that goes, Whee!
No, you know what?
We may...
We maybe need to get Jamie to, like, do the voices.
Because, you know, we haven't had a real, like, bitch in DDR since the solo nurse.
So Jamie needs to just get up there and go, You make Captain Jack cry!
You've got no rhythm!
I talk like I'm in a tin can!
Yeehaw!
That's in your mix, too, actually.
Sadly enough.
Really?
Cool.
Oh, your dance makes me wet!
Max!
The porno mix!
I did not want to play DDR in here myself.
No, we need the Ridge Racer announcer.
We need to rip lines from Ridge Racer.
I like that one.
You dance like a drunken crack whore.
You are a drunken crack whore.
Get out of here!
You step like a dog pisses.
Bitch better have my money.
You step like dog piss.
Well, let's just... You know what?
Come to think of it, I know DCB isn't here.
I don't see him in the chat room tonight.
But we ought to just take out the announcer and just put in Wesley Willis clips.
Welcome to London.
Welcome to Chicago.
Nobody's going to get that, sorry.
I apologize for killing the topic.
Where do they get off charging $1,500 for this each?
They don't.
I don't know.
Unless they're selling full machines, no upgrade is worth that.
We didn't talk about some of the fabulous songs that you can play in DDR Top Hits.
Let's name some of these gems, shall we?
Featuring top US artist Britney Spears with Boyz and Krazy Boyz, I haven't heard Boyz, but you know, Krazy, maybe, but those aren't exactly, you know Let's see, Oops She Didn't Again, or what was the other one that she did?
Who cares?
Boyz was a song that she played in Goldmember
Beyonce Knowles, Work It Out.
Isn't that a rather new song?
I don't know.
I thought that song just came out a little while ago, so they've been working on this right up until right now.
Out of My Head and Fia.
Eminem, Without Me.
Pink, Most Girls.
Pink, Most Girls, Ricky Martin, Cup of Life, La Vida Loca, She Bangs.
Now, see, the people who worked on this obviously have a Ricky Martin fetish, because there's more Ricky Martin than anything else in here.
You know, most of the songs on there I've never heard.
Ricky Martin.
Cup of Life sucks, Livin' La Vida Loca is crap, and She Bangs is shit.
Although, don't you want to say that you dance to She Bangs?
Actually, Cup of Life and La Vida Loca I have heard because I have Samba de Amigo.
Imagine the video for She Bangs.
We'll get the fucking... Wait, are you going to make new movies for the Loki mix or whatever?
Actually, I was thinking of putting 2DX videos for some of them in there.
But yeah, we could put random videos.
We could have the ferret in there.
I don't know.
Whatever the fuck we want to do.
This is pretty much what we want to do.
I'm actually surprised that they're going to go and actually do something.
We'll just rob like Captain Jack.
Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left.
I'm just surprised that they're actually willing to do something like this.
I mean, that's kind of ballsy, I would think, you know, just to like say, ah, you know what, we're just going to put some hack fucking arcade game in our arcade.
It's just like, I don't know, if Jason Enos saw that.
Your hack makes Jason Enos cry.
All I gotta say, though, is if they're gonna fucking punish me, just give me a fucking job at Konami.
Seriously.
Oh, is this what the point is behind it, to say, either you're gonna hire me, or I'm gonna fuck you up?
No, this is what it's gonna say, is, well, if you're gonna take so long to make a fucking, you know, DDR mix, and you just say, I'm gonna do it for you!
And then I'm gonna say, ha, you suck, because my mix owns all of you, and you just suck ass.
Oh, look at this!
My mix is more popular than the Extreme Machine in Scandia.
Oh, you suck!
I don't know how hard it would be to convert the characters over from DDRPC.
We could put Mr. Spanky in training mode.
Maybe.
All right.
We'll put a video in the background with him whipping Betty or something.
Or no, Betty whipping him because he looks like a bitch.
Nelly with Hotton here.
Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams, Shakira, and many more.
Mariah Carey, that crap right there.
I'm sure it'll be as wonderful as Glitter.
It'll be as wonderful as the DDR Fifth Mix solo also.
Alright, oh yes, the DDR5 mix solo, what the hell was that all about?
Did anybody ever purchase that to see if it worked or anything?
No, but it's probably the same thing.
Laser Force should die.
Yeah.
Alright, let's see, they didn't hack all the songs in this though.
No, they left in Butterfly.
They left in Butterfly, for whatever reason, because Butterfly is poppy fun, I guess.
Alright, we're going to take a real quick break.
As promised, I'm going to play that song that I did my very first step file for because, yeah, I'm a co-host on this show and I can do things like that when I want.
And then we'll hear some other stuff and we're going to come back and talk about more fun things.
Oh, we have a new game to play tonight.
Maybe we'll do that after the break.
I don't know.
We'll see.
We'll see if you guys have been good or not.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We will be right back, everybody.
Thank you for watching!
In the game, Drew Moore, since the day the bank was in Way back when, I've been putting it down Ask the Holy Ghost about it, get your list out of town
And now here's something we hope you'll really like, Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
Hello everybody, this is Mr. Spanky.
I hope you're enjoying getting to play me in the newest version of DDRPC.
And now I'd like to present to everybody out there Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
Today we're going to talk about planning a masturbation party.
Because everybody knows that Mr. Spanky likes to attend masturbation parties with his friend Betty.
Mr. Spanky would like to remind you that when you're planning a masturbation party, do not forget the latex.
You should get several boxes of latex gloves as well as a wide variety of condoms, both lubricated and unlubricated.
Also, pick up some dental dams.
Even if people keep to themselves, the latex can add a new dimension to the fun.
If the masturbation gets interactive, the latex is absolutely necessary to keep things safe.
Are you enjoying my masturbation tips, DarkSakura?
Are you enjoying my masterbass and pips, Loki?
I was just checking, thank you.
I've been a naughty boy this week.
I'd also like to remind you to lube it up.
Get plenty of water-based lubricants.
You may want to opt for single use packets rather than big bottles.
It will cost a little more but it's a lot neater and cleaner and guests will be happy to have their own lube supplies.
I'd also like to remind you to cover your furniture and even the floor with seats so that will make people more comfortable and help keep things tidy.
You like to keep things neat when you masturbate, don't you?
Lastly, Mr. Spanky would like to urge you to clean up.
Because nobody likes a messy masturbation thing.
And we all know that a masturbation party can be quite a mess.
Especially if you're masturbating to DVR in the nude.
That's really messy.
Remember folks, don't let DVR be your bitch.
Remember to use baby wipes, tissues, and paper towels, and they should be provided in abundance.
You need to use these things to clean Mr. Spanky's bank.
Things are bound to get messy, but having the necessities immediately at hand can decrease the carnage considerably.
You should also set up several dress chants around the play area.
Line them up with plastic bags for easy and safe disposal.
Remember to take inventory on your sex toys in case something gets lodged somewhere and you lose it.
Excuse me, excuse me, is your name Mr. Spanky?
No, I'm Mr. Spanky and these are my tips.
Oh, someone's a little pissed off.
Did someone get a hamster stuck up their sphincter and just kind of forget about it?
Were you at that party?
I didn't see you at that party.
Oh, you were one of the masked people, weren't you?
Oh, I understand.
Is your name Valencia?
That does it for Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
Please enjoy me in the new DDR Character Pack, number 9 for DDR PC.
And now, I'm taking you back to that crappy radio show.
Remix
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?
Roll the sound stick and move it with your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat and kill them all Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
Damn, what am I gonna do?
It's really funny.
They should put the catch-up song in DDR.
Please, Loki, please, please, please.
Actually, that was one of the songs planned to be in there.
All right, cool.
Anyway.
It's going to be a long, long, long time before we ever see anything, though, right?
I plan on saying, yeah, at least six months.
At least.
At least.
All right.
Well, we'll be looking forward to that.
We'll see updates as they go.
Anywho, it's funny, the catch-up song, there's another funny story I have about that.
Last night I was out at the club and the DJ put that on as the very last song and says, I really hate this song, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
And then nobody knew the catch-up dance, so I wish Dave had been there so he could have done the catch-up dance, because he's the only person I know that knows it.
I only know this.
Anyway...
That's my catch up story.
Thank you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If you want to send me your fuck you's of the week, go ahead and do that in the chat room.
Just PM them over to Sky.
And remember, if they don't come over a private message, they don't count.
Or you can send them to email.
You can send them over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And I have to ask Jamie now, do we want the terror mix of Schlagwerk or do we want the original?
Let's go for the terror mix.
We want the terror mix, so I need to find it.
So we're going to have a new fuck you song for...
It's always going to still be Schlagwerk.
It will always be Schlagwerk.
I will never not use Attack Song.
Yes, you'll get Jenny Rom, JB, I promise.
Alright, here we go.
It's time for the Fuck Use of the Week.
Okay, let's... This is fucked up.
Okay.
The first fuck you of the week goes to Walgreens for not having chocolate cupcakes.
Everybody here knows that chocolate cupcakes are my crack food.
Well, they didn't have them.
They had chocolate zingers, which I think are becoming my new crack food.
Anyway, so I'm not as sufficiently wired as I could be, although I almost finished a bottle of Propel.
Which fuck you to Mr. Spanky for making me nearly choke on my Propel.
Okay?
Um, let's see.
I think he likes choking.
Yeah, Mr. Spanky, from what I hear, enjoys choking.
Another fuck you goes toward the shitty week I had, because I just felt shitty and PMS-y, and that sucked.
Actually, you know, that was bad.
My other fuck you is a very, very serious fuck you.
It goes toward drama queens.
Not all drama queens are bad, mind you.
But then there's the people who complain about their life and then don't do shit to change it.
If you hate your life, do something about it.
If you want change to happen, go make it fucking happen.
You know, it may not be instant, but you don't have a right to bitch unless you start doing something about it.
Okay?
That's what I want to say about that.
and on a happier note, um, do you need to be happy bunny plushies and fuck them for not making me?
I did see a happy bunny doll once.
Somewhere.
I don't remember.
It was on a topic, I think.
Oh, and a happy bunny plushie?
Oh, we'll find you one for Christmas.
Alright.
Oh, one more thing.
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac is cool.
Okay, thank you.
I'm not getting many fuck yous of the week in the chat room.
This is kind of surprising.
I've seen one pop up so far.
Usually there's like 20.
So, just another reminder, send them all on your way.
Unless you're sending them over email, that's fine too.
OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com They need happy noodle boy plushies.
Moving along, Loki, your fuck yous of the week, please.
Oh boy.
Okay, let's begin with that hellhole that we call Sunsplash.
Or Arvigil for all those.
Let me do this time.
Okay, well I went there two days this week, that was probably mistake number one.
First thing I go there, there's some dumbass behind the counter, I want, you know, soda.
You stand there, kind of, you know, dead to the world.
So I see the bell, and I press spell.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I do that for about two minutes.
And it finally goes, oh, oh, oh, and just sees me there.
So then I'm like, okay, can I get a large surge?
Uh, we don't have surge no more.
So fuck them for not having surge, and fuck that stupid idiot.
Fuck them for hiring dumbass people.
Why the hell do they have dumbass kids working at this stupid place?
I swear.
and fuck them today for not fucking refilling the machine fast enough with tickets because I keep kicking ass at stupid Speed Demon.
So fuck them for that and just fuck them for not keeping the machines up because they suck ass.
So I hate them, that's fine.
Now the next thing I have an FU for is SQS, also known as Stupid Question Syndrome.
These stupid people out there that ask you really dumb, obvious questions.
For instance, when I'm playing the machine, I have a giant stash of tickets in there.
Did you win those from that machine there?
Yeah.
That's why they're coming at the machine?
That's why there's a big pile attached to the machine on the floor.
I won them for the machine.
How did you know that?
I won them, you fucking idiot!
Also, for people that drive below the speed limit.
The speed limit's posted there, so you drive faster than it.
It's a goal, you know, you wanna achieve better than the speed limit.
But these people are just like, oh, the speed limit, they stay away from it like it's like a fucking, uh, leper or something like that, you know?
Just like, stay away from that piece of shit, and they drive like 20 under the speed limit.
I'm like, trying to swerve around them and shit.
I hate them.
I hate slow people.
I hate slow people mentally.
I hate slow people in automobiles.
May they all die.
Fucking A. I swear, they should give me, you know, fucking license to kill.
I would save the world.
Just eliminate the fucking weakness of our damn society.
KILL THE STUPID PEOPLE!
KILL THEM ALL!
Yeah, but without stupid people, what would give us smart people any kind of meaning?
There has to be a balance.
We'll just lock them up in little pens.
Yeah, but right now it's like 9 to 10, or 9 to 1, or something like that, you know?
You have 9 stupid people, and you have 1 smart person.
9 stupid people, 1 smart person.
I say we just, like, drop it down to 3 to 1?
I don't know, something like that?
Yeah, so they all suck.
I hate them.
Stupid people are meant to be peons of the smart.
We order them around and they fight our war for us.
Yeah, but then they're stupid and they get in our way and they annoy me and they ask me stupid questions and just... I hate them.
I hate them all.
Die.
Fucking die.
You want all their balls to die.
Yes.
Um, that, yeah, that's pretty much it.
Uh, FB to Fortune Cookie to tell me to kill my relatives.
Because, uh, I don't like that.
It's not cool.
And, uh, yeah, Fortune Cookies kind of suck.
What kind of fortunes are these?
It says, you'll inherit a large sum of money from your relatives.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
I forget what the fucking thing said, but it basically called me ugly or stupid, so the fuck that stupid fortune cookie?
See, it said I'm stupid!
Said I'm stupid!
May they die!
Anyways, that's it.
You're stupid, it said you didn't have any common sense.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and we started playing Oni Mode and keep in mind I haven't played DDR in about three weeks, by the way and I'm like, oh, I'll play Oni Mode with Brad and I said, Brad, I'm willing to do any Oni in the game except Love Revenge because I always fail Japan like in five seconds because I can't ever get those gallops shut up, stop laughing at me, fuck you so, of course, what does Brad decide to pick?
he picks the Oni, Naoki featuring Politary I'm going to double this fuck you I had to listen to this
So fuck Brad.
I hate you.
I'm just kidding.
I love you, Brad.
But not too much.
Irene's watching.
I'd also like to say F you to being tired because I was really tired at the club last night.
And that's just not cool to go to a club and feel like you're dancing like a zombie.
Unless you're at a golf club, then, you know, that's what you're supposed to be doing.
I like to say F you to not doing a damn thing this week, really.
I just kind of sat at home and just relaxed all week.
Oh, F you to sleeping like 12 hours, because that's what I did last night.
I went to bed at 4.30 in the morning and I woke up at 4-ish, 4.30 this afternoon.
So F you to sleeping 12 hours, because what a waste of time.
You can't say F you to me, because I'm too nice for you.
I got you your song in Animal Crossing.
That's true, you did get my song in Animal Crossing.
FU for Rob not being here when I got here and had to wait half an hour in the cold.
Oh yes, FU to me sleeping in so long that it took me a while to go get Jamie and Loki had to wait out here in the cold in front of my house for a half hour.
But I saw Harry Potter today.
FU to Loki because he brought Mongolian barbecue and steak up my whole house, asshole.
I saw Harry Potter today.
My day was good.
Not an FU.
No, my day was good.
Ha ha.
So that's all your bad days.
All right.
Let's go around the room and listen to some other Fuck You's of the Week.
JB, do you have any Fuck You's of the Week?
Yes, I do.
That's it?
Alright, that's it.
Hand that microphone on over to Bradley, see if he has anything he wants to say.
Um, not too much, I think.
Maybe they fuck me for being so lazy all the time.
I need to find a job, I just sit around at home all day doing nothing.
City and IRC, talking to people.
But at least you're not on unemployment.
No, I'm not on unemployment.
So at least you're not, you're leeching from the system.
I'm not bagging on the system.
You're okay.
Oh, and maybe adding to Loki's fuck you to the people on the road.
Fuck people who gawk all the time and slow everyone down for miles.
People like to see people just stop on the side of the road because they have many other problems than people else.
Oh, look!
There's someone on the side of the road!
There's stuff!
I was like, look!
And stare and slow down and slow everyone else down!
I don't want to talk to him, so I ignore him, I walk around, I don't talk to him, I don't make eye contact with him, I wish he would just die, and stop talking to me!
Stop trying to talk to me!
and FU to the kid who likes to grab... JB, chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.
Chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.
FU to the kid that grabs asses in a football tournament.
You sure that's not Mr. Spanky's son?
What's he wearing, leather?
Uh... Oh, ass!
Alright, let's go on to the chat room and email FU, shall we?
Good God, Twin, you got too many FUs.
I'm reading some of these.
A lot of FUs to Justin for being Jenny Rom's bitch and not his and not sending him Jenny Rom songs.
FU to people at the arcade literally hanging on the PVP machine.
FU to still having dial-up.
FU to Jenny Rom songs being hard to find.
F you to Mr. Spanky, finally someone with his opinions.
And F you to no one using the new V-host he set up for the chatroom.
F you to... Oh no, that's not an F you.
That's an happy F you.
I don't read happy things on this show, so F you, Twen.
Skyline says, F you to Germs for making him sick.
That does suck.
I hate being sick.
I was sick a couple weeks ago.
Oh, Black Lab has a few F yous.
I better restart the song.
This is going to be long.
Fuck that Mr. Spanky thing.
I've been internally soiled.
I hate you.
Mr. Spanky, thank you.
Welcome.
Fuck the UCD library for only having one copy of every book, so some of the books I needed weren't in stock.
Fuck the drama that my suitemates are getting into with other people, and fuck the MGL... Oh, that's not very nice.
Well, okay, he says fuck himself because he has two finals and can't go to the MGL tournament on Friday the 13th.
I guess.
Some of us have jobs in K-Road.
But we realize that the people organizing the tournament probably couldn't get any other day, so life just sucks sometimes.
Yes, I won't be able to go to that either, and I want to, I really do.
We send our love.
Yes, we send our love and blowjobs.
DarkTetStudio says, F you for still having the same Vanessa May song for the longest time now.
Now we need to work on that.
We're never getting rid of Destiny.
We'll never get rid of Destiny, but we might add something else in there too.
I know we won't red hot in there and...
I want Devil's Chill in there, but I think that's a little too fast for me.
We shall see.
And F you to the bastard who keeps outbidding me on my Japanese PlayStation 2.
It's my bitch!
Back down!
Or go down!
That's it.
Alright.
Oh, you have another one, Jamie.
Yes.
Thank you to my Parapara controller for not working.
Thank you.
Vidpower says, F you to viruses.
I had a cold all week and I started running a small fever.
I also have a sore throat from it.
Also, F you to the sun for having glare on the Beatmania 2DX machine and making the screen even harder to see.
At least you have a Beatmania 2DX machine in town.
F you.
Slinky says, F you to the Metreon pads for sticking.
What do you expect?
Why are you playing at the Metreon?
It's like two bucks a game.
Fuck the Metreon for charging that much for a piece of shit EDR USA.
Actually, they have Max 2s upstairs now.
Who cares?
Just wanted to point that out.
Let's see.
Oh, he went to the auto show today.
Oh, Loki says that's okay.
Brack2000 says, F you to Lost Ketchup for existing.
Yes!
If you don't know, they're the ladies that sing the Ketchup song.
They basically stole that song from the Sugarhill Gang, by the way.
It's a sample of Rapper's Delight.
F you to the closest DDR machine being 40 miles away.
Crap, that does suck.
I'm sorry.
I have had a cry for you just now.
Yeah, cry.
I drove out to Roosevelt Beltland 40 miles every week to play DDR.
So screw you, I don't care.
But if you wanted to, you could go to Tapioca Express.
Not when it first came out here.
That's right.
That's the USA day.
Alright.
I first started playing this.
23rd Magus says, F you to Afronova Primeval, which he passed with 1 tenth of a bar left.
Also, F you to Nori Nori Nori for obvious reasons.
Oh, that happens to be the song I'm playing right now.
It was me and Wanda the first time I passed it.
I had like half my... Actually, I had... You know how on Fifth Mix they have the little tiny bars that equal the whole bar?
I had half of one of those left.
That sucks.
Yeah, fuck Wanda.
I guess that's it.
Oh, we need to check now, because I know we have at least one email sitting in there, so I will go to the mail.
La la la, going to the mailbag.
Oh, I need mailbag music.
Let's open up the mailbag.
We'll have to play one Jenny Rom song just because it fits.
Oh, we're going to play Email Me.
Email Me is not Jenny Rom, that's Paul and Terry.
You meant Blonde Girl.
You want Blonde Girl or you want Email Me?
Email Me.
You're going to break your own ban?
It's not on the normal playlist.
All right.
Actually, it used to be, but I took it out because you banned Paul Eteri, remember?
Go ahead and play it because I actually kind of want to hear it.
All right.
I'm not the only one coming out of the closet tonight on the show, apparently.
Okay, okay.
Here.
Give me this.
Hi.
I just turned it off because I can't hear.
Because this is me...
Say something!
Oh, hi!
What are you looking for?
Are you looking for a new song?
Yes.
This is our email music?
Okay.
Here's our new email music.
Alright.
And Rob is typing in stuff.
Oh wait, I forgot we changed the password to the box.
I forgot about this.
It's the same one as the LiveJournal password.
Oh yes, tell everybody about the LiveJournal community.
We have a LiveJournal community.
It's called Orange Lounge.
If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge, you get to look at our crap every day.
And it's interesting crap.
It doesn't stink.
All right.
F you to Yahoo for sending me spam.
We have spam in our mailbox right now.
And it looks like I wrote a note to myself in there, too, which I already took care of, so I can delete those.
So let's open up this email from Dave, who isn't here tonight.
And he sent us an email saying, I'm not there.
He says, read this word for word.
We'll see.
Well, sorry I couldn't be there this week, so a big F you to both my parents for taking me to Big Sur, which blows ass.
What is Big Sur?
Waterbed store.
Okay.
It's on the coast?
What do they do there?
I don't know.
I think that's where they have, like, surfing companies.
Okay.
Oh, a surf shop, dude!
No, when I lived in Alabama, there's a waterbed store called Big Sur Waterbeds.
Wait, Loki, in the mic.
Big Sur is a fucking campground.
It's in, like, the coast.
Alright, it's like a forest or some shit like that.
We need to take this show to the wilderness!
I've never heard of that place.
I always knew of it as being a waterbed store.
I was going to drive down past there, but fuck you to the Sacramento traffic, so I had to go to some mountains.
That was cool.
Because I got to do that before the snow came to the mountains.
Bradley, by the way, is the king of impromptu road trips.
The king.
I'm sorry, JB?
The name of that one movie where they have a place where they camp out?
George Lounge and the Blair Witch Project, thank you.
Fuck, fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck was that?
Fuck this, fuck that!
That was basically the Blair Witch Project in 10 seconds, thank you.
The Mr. Spanky Project!
Da-da-dum!
Keep reading.
Haha.
And oh, if you want to join our IRC chat, just go to any other side IRC server and it's Channel Pound Orange Lounge, or it's on most of the same servers as the other big Mamani chat rooms.
How cute.
I was there last night, and the only person there was Black Lab, so... Oh, well, you were there for a second.
You were idling.
I was asleep.
I was downloading stuff.
And also, FYI, you can get to the chat room directly through our website.
We have a Java chat for those of you that just don't have the time to set up MIRC or don't want to or you're on a work computer.
I don't know why the hell you'd be at work on a Sunday night, but it is Monday morning in some countries.
You know we don't have Java on my work computer?
Well, that kind of sucks.
Don't let us run the... I can't run it.
Anyway, you can do that directly through our website, orangelounge.skiu.tx F you to Jamie for eating my taquitos a while ago.
Dude, you left him here, butthole.
Okay, that's about it.
Maybe more later.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was our FUs of the week.
Oh wait, I got one more.
I got one more, I'm sorry.
I have to find a special song for this FU too, I'm sorry.
Just give me one minute here.
Okay.
Here we go.
Sorry, we'll take a break right after this FU.
FU to Internet Drama from DCB.
Thank you.
I don't know if you can hear, but we're playing Wesley Willis for you in the background.
Alright, because Jamie has to pee, we're going to take a quick break and we will be right back.
And when we come back, the Bamani Cage Match, a brand new game we're going to play here.
on the show.
Your votes will determine what the next song to go into Orange Lounge playlist rotation during the Bomani Music & More program, which plays when we're not on this station, will be.
And, uh, yeah, so in the meantime, enjoy some Guitar Freaks music.

Here we go!
Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball Hello Alright, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Episode number 21
And now, as promised, we are going to start the Big Fat Bomani Cage Match.
I need some good cage match music.
What's a good... What's a good cage match song?
Something 2DX-ish.
I'm thinking something kind of...
Ooh, I don't know if I have We Will Rock You.
I might.
I think I have one of the other Queen covers in another directory.
How about, like, uh... Radical Fate?
Okay, alright, that'll work.
That'll work.
Oh, Shlag works for another segment, don't you think?
And then, uh, Electro-Tuned.
Electro-Tuned.
Do I have Electro-Tuned?
I thought I did.
Do you?
If you've got... I've got them all.
Hold on.
I've got everything, it's just in a different directory.
I think...
How about Holic?
Holic's a good song.
What's Holic?
Holic will work.
Okay.
What?
What, JB?
What?
Get out!
You are banned from the show.
JB just admitted that he does not like tag.
Oh, he likes QQQ.
I threw the Clifford ball at him.
The Clifford Ball of Justice has been tossed to JB Without further ado The Bomani Cage Match
Now, since the first time we've done the Bomani Cage match, what this is going to be all about is we're going to play you two songs, and they aren't from any Bomani game.
Let's play that out in front.
They are not from any Bomani game, but they have something to do with either a Bomani artist, a Bomani, some kind of Bomani relation, like another cover of a Bomani song, another Dance Maniacs dance track, or it's just kind of video game related.
Yeah, the winner wins
The winner is then challenged next week by a new song, and if a new song beats the winner out, then it plays for the week.
Otherwise, the winner will stay on and play for the next week.
Maybe what we'll do is we'll do next week it'll be three and we'll bring back the one from last week as well.
We'll do that.
I like that idea.
Okay, so this week it's only going to be two folks.
It's only going to be two songs that we're going to play.
Now, are we going to actually play the entire songs or do you just want to play clips?
I think we ought to play the whole song.
No, play clips of each and then whichever one wins plays the whole thing.
I think we ought to play the whole song.
That's how... What?
What?
Really different all the way through.
Well, what do you guys think?
I don't know.
Full song?
Well, okay, we'll do the whole thing.
So what we're going to do, though, is we're not going to go into that right just yet.
We'll go to another topic on the program and kind of do that as our next break.
You want to do it now?
All right, we'll do it now.
Okay, so the two songs we're going to match up tonight in the Big Mamadi Cage match.
Oop, not Viv Ribbon, my bad.
Maybe that'll be next week, though.
Okay, the two songs are...
The Zippers with All Around the World, The Bubble Mix.
And for those that don't know who the Zippers are, well, JB, you're the expert.
Why don't you tell everybody who the Zippers are and what they've done in DDR?
The Zippers were Jenny Rom versus Zippers, and they did Waka Waka.
And you can't really tell the difference between them because they both sound exactly the same.
Let's see.
Okay, and the second song that we're going to have playing is going to be, it's actually an overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy, or FF Music DJ.
It's Final Fantasy 7, String Machine, the Choral Prison mix.
Choral, or Chorel, whatever.
So first we're going to play, and then you'll also get to get our opinions Since we have to participate in this somehow, we're not getting to vote in this You're going to get our big fat opinions on this We're going to be like the American Idol judges on these songs So if they suck, we're going to let you know So we're putting on our judging faces right now So, and then once we've given you our opinions on the songs, you'll be able to vote Now here's the thing, don't vote until they've both been played or your vote doesn't count I'm not counting any votes that come in until the second song has finished completely
Yes, they're saying they can't hear you on the air, JB.
You want to scream something at the camera?
Ah!
Brilliant.
Alright, so here we go.
Starting off the Bomani Cage match, this is the Zippers with All Around the World.
1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3
We wanna get some fun all around the world Let's sing some in this magical land You know Hey boy, come on This is a silly song for you Oh yeah We're gonna get some fun all around the world We wanna be
I sing this song, song, song for you
This song makes me want to kill people.
All right, the Bomani Cage Match in progress right now.
That was All Around the World by The Zippers.
Your thoughts, some things from the chatroom.
We're getting, this song is the shit, this song reminds me of CatDog, and I can't tell because there's a whole other cage match going on in the chatroom, so I can't really tell what they're saying about the song.
That song may be the shit, but it's time to flush.
Oh, Jamie, ouch.
So you didn't like it.
On a scale of 1 to 10, Jamie.
I'd give it a fart.
I'd have to say that, you know, I really hated the song Around the World by ATC, but I like that song now.
So you like that song or you like this song?
I'm just not digging the whole Disneyland happy vibe going on here.
All right, JB.
I like it because it's Sci-Fam.
You like it because it's Sci-Fam.
All right, fair enough.
Bradley, your thoughts on that song?
It was okay, but it kept going on and on, the same beat over and over.
I was like, uh-oh, turn it off, turn it off.
It's going to pound into my brain until it explodes.
Four hours a day.
So when you were about to go postal?
Yes.
I agree, my thoughts are it was very happy, happy, happy, happy.
It was kind of like nauseatingly happy.
The beginning was bad, but I could deal with it.
It's not that bad.
It's a nice change of pace from, you know, meanness.
In what dictionary?
Are you going to notthedictionary.com?
No, that's what makes me want to go out and kill people.
And sing while I'm doing it.
Alright, so...
It makes me happy, noodle boy happy.
Alright, going around the room, quick, scale of 1 to 10.
What do you think?
Uh, 1.5.
1.5.
Bradley?
Probably about a 4.
Probably about a 4.
JB?
10.
10.
Uh, I will give it a 6.
I'll give it a 6.
Alright, so that was... I'm twitching.
Zippers all around the world.
Here's the second song in the cage match.
This is by Final Fantasy Music DJ.
It's an overclocked remix.
This is the Final Fantasy 7 String Machine here on the Bomani Cage Match.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
That was fucking cool!
It's the Bomani Cage match going on right now.
You can start sending in your votes right now via the chat room or our email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
And it is, once again, the Zippers with All Around the World was the first song we played, and that song was Final Fantasy Music DJ, an overclocked remix of Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
So, let's talk about what we thought of the Final Fantasy String Machine.
Jamie, your thoughts?
Wee!
I love it.
Wee, you love it.
Loki?
I, of course, love it.
It's one of the best Final Fantasy music remixes I've ever heard.
Which song was it?
I couldn't recognize what song it was.
Yeah, I guess it's supposed, it's, yeah, Choral Prison from Final Fantasy VII.
I honestly didn't recognize the original song either.
To me, that's obscure.
It's the place that was in the desert under the Gold Cross Ark.
Oh, okay.
I need to play Final Fantasy VII again sometime.
That's what that song makes me think.
Bradley, your thoughts on the song?
It's pretty cool.
Pretty cool?
I liked it.
Alright, you liked it.
JB, your thoughts?
X. He's making a big X with his fingers.
But of course, he's a Jenny Rom horse, so of course he's sticking with the zippers.
It's not happy enough for him.
Thanks for watching!
I think that's very cool.
Although, it's a little bit kind of repetitive for my taste.
I don't know.
I found it to be a little bit repetitive.
So, that's my only issue with it.
So, scale of 1 to 10.
Jamie, what do you think?
9.
9.
Loki?
10.
10.
Bradley?
8.
JB?
4.
I'm going to give it a 7.
So, it sounds like that song would win if we were the people voting, but we're not, because this is everybody's show.
It's not just our show, it's the chatroom show, email show.
So send in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com If you want the zippers to win, or you want the Final Fantasy VII string machine to win.
That's it, that's my arcade match.
We'll have the results for you after the next break.
This is your subliminal message, but for Final Fantasy.
In the meantime... The spirit commands it.
Big news this week, Big Bomani Holiday.
19 November and 20 November were both this week, and we had some very big things happen.
Jamie, tell us about one thing you wanted to talk about.
I feel 20 November and its honor on 2DX.
On 2DX?
Oh, yes.
I'd like to just, I guess, consider, or just basically say 19 and 20 November would pretty much be the Bomani New Year's.
That's pretty much what it is, since 20 November was pretty much the start of the whole Bomani line with Beatmania, so I would consider it the New Year's.
I don't know if I consider it New Year's, it's not a big party, it's just kind of like a day of remembrance.
Well, okay, hey, hey, hey.
It's just like Chinese New Year's, I mean, no one celebrates that.
Well, the Chinese do, I think.
Oh, yeah, like they count, okay.
Oh, they're only like, you know, I think a quarter of the world's population.
Who cares?
That's pretty much what it is, it's an uncelebrated holiday.
It's like, um...
Arbor Day.
Okay, so it's the Bomani Arbor Day.
Plant a Bomani machine.
So what were some big events that happened in the community?
I know you know of one.
Jamie, you want to talk about this earlier?
I got online and they were like, the show wasn't there.
It was like robbed.
Oh yeah, Orange Lounge Radio did a celebration very late on 19 November around 11.30.
We kind of had a countdown until 20 November.
And we had video game guessing.
Yes, and then 20 November was celebrated guessing old school 8-bit video game tunes.
Which is why you should be listening to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.
Yes, have your life like us.
Because sometimes you get to hear special live music programs.
They happen occasionally.
We call them the fuck-offs.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I can't use the Nokia ringtones and that makes me cry.
But we wanted to play your ringtone, didn't we?
Well, my ringtone's not Baymani, but... Well, let's play your ringtone anyway, because we wanted to do this.
So I'm going to call you right now, Jamie.
No, I can just play it.
Oh, you can just play it?
Oh, never mind.
Don't give me any voicemail, damn it.
My ringtone is cooler than everybody.
I'm trying to see if anybody in the chat room is going to recognize it.
I'll play it again.
No, you won't play it again, apparently.
I will, too.
VidPower says it's Chun-Li's stage.
Wrong!
Oh, 23rd Magus says that, too.
Dude, no.
No, not Chun-Li.
Stop insulting my girl.
For those in the chat room that couldn't guess it, what do you think?
What is it, Jamie?
It's Sakura's theme song.
Sakura's theme song.
Wrong girl.
No, DarkSakura.
Sakura's theme.
I hate Chun-Li.
Okay?
I hate Chun-Li.
So close, yet so far.
You almost have it.
God, I hate her.
Okay, here's my ringtone.
It's not Bomani-related at all.
Why isn't it playing?
Because you suck.
Oh, because it vibrates on.
Whoops, my bad.
Yeah, Rob's pocket vibrator.
Yes, my cell phone doubles... Every call is a happy call.
My cell phone doubles as a vibrator.
It's quite exciting.
Oh, that doesn't work.
What happened?
There's my magical ringtones here.
No, we can't guess what that is.
That's Afronova, right?
No, it's a song called The Entertainer.
And I'm sure since there's this trend in Bomani to redo a bunch of classical songs into Bomani tunes, I'm sure you'll see that tune up turn up in a Bomani song one day.
If you play that song again and you just go... Whoa!
Dude!
It's a talker remix!
Hey, you should put that in your sim.
They need to do the bad synthy music and make it a pata pata.
That would be wrong.
Stop playing with a ferret.
Give me that.
Okay.
So, yes, other 19, 20 November celebrations.
In Japan, I believe they released the code to unlock 8th Style's hidden stuff.
So now you don't have to... We were thinking... I can play Sakura and fail with Style.
Yes, now you can play Sakura without having to triple A, you know, B for U on another heavy whatever.
And then Xenon.
And two more, yep, two brand new songs also.
But no...
No more tag.
Sorry, Jamie.
You have to wait for Night Style.
You think there's going to be a Night Style?
God, yes.
God, yes.
You need a ferret.
I'm not sure if this happened exactly on 19-20 November, but another website news, 2DX Style kind of got eaten up by BomaniStyle.com, right?
Was that earlier, or what happened with that?
That was last week.
That was last week.
My bad.
But didn't they kind of celebrate it?
Bomani Style redid their site, so that's another one.
I guess that's 20 November-ish, I don't know.
That was 19 November.
Any other websites that redid special things for 19-20 November?
I can't think of any.
DDR Spot was probably the biggest one.
DDR Maniacs deleted my account along with 2,000 other ones, so I guess that's November related, sort of.
Happy 20 November!
Happy 20 November.
Crunch, you're gone.
I went to bed, and then I went to work.
Yes, how did you privately celebrate 20 November amongst ourselves in the room?
What was your own way of celebrating 20 November?
Well, first of all, I went to bed, and then I woke up and went to work.
And instead of doing my work, I talked on my email with my friend in Maryland.
Then I went home and I failed 20 November in 6th style on 7 key because it's a 7 star and I can't pass any yet, although I'm close.
And then I put it away and went online and posted it on a bunch of message boards and then played Animal Crossing.
And then I played 20 November again.
Yeah.
And I full comboed some songs, but I forgot what they were.
And I passed Fantasy.
Fantasy.
I passed Fantasy and Light 7 on 4th style Because that was like one of the last two songs I had to do But I fucking hate Get On Beat, thank you Next Loki, how did you celebrate 20 November?
I did one more thing I went to bed I played DDR at lunch That's it Alright, yes, Bradley, how did you celebrate 20 November?
I didn't really do much of anything
Bless for me!
J.B., how did you celebrate 20 November?
I secretly worshipped Ginny Rom.
Gee, how's that different from any other day?
That means he had a faptastic time.
He had a faptastic 20 November, yes.
Thank you, Jamie.
How did I celebrate 20 November?
I went to work, I came home, I watched 24, I continued my three-week streak of not playing any DDR, jerked off and went to bed.
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
Or at least you'll never know.
Yes, Loki?
You know, I know this is really the wrong segment to be doing this.
That's alright.
But I just remembered another FU for the week.
And it goes, wait, you don't need to play the music.
You don't need to play the music.
Oh, fine.
Jamie demands I play the music.
Therefore, I play the music.
F you to the Sakmamani server for fucking crashing constantly all this week.
That's it.
Oh, also... Yeah, but you can pay for any place to host us.
F you to Sakmamani.com as well for not having the space on it to host the Orange Lounge forums as well because that kind of caused the crash.
I was kind of trying to set up a little surprise for 20 November for Orange Lounge and that kind of pushed us over quota.
My bad.
No.
And if you were Rob for the... My account got deleted yet again from another glitch that happened to be... If you're the one that posts that causes the quota to get hit, then you get your account deleted.
Lucky me!
Because I'm always online posting.
Whatever.
You got a bigger post count out of it, I think, anyway.
As if that stuff... Oh, no, you didn't?
I don't know.
I guessed.
Not that it matters.
You're still number one!
It don't matter!
Shit!
I'm 500 posts above anyone else.
We'll get you to your ho and back, lickety-split.
No shit.
I've got to play that again.
I love it.
I had a different portion cookie today.
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.
We're going to announce the winner of the Bomani Cage Match.
There is still time to vote.
Just come to our chat room and vote via private message for the zippers with All Around the World or the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
or you can send it over email, orangelaunceradio at yahoo.com.
And there's a conversation in the chat room going on right now saying, I worked on a Brilliant to You routine over the weekend to do other people's routines for practice to see how they pull off the moves.
It helps with the flow.
And that kind of made me think, there's a song I want to play right now.
Do they have the Ori no Go flow?
Sail away, sail away.
No, but I thought of another flow song that I wanted to play for you guys.
It facilitates bowel movements, though.
So we're going to start this break off with Flotation, the radio mix.
This is a different one.
This is the one from Vincent D'Amour's greatest hits album.
This isn't the same one that's in rotation on Orange Lounge.
Stop molesting the ferret!
There's two vocal mixes of Flotation.
This is the other one that you don't normally hear on Orange Lounge.
But you're going to hear it right now, so enjoy.
Flotation
Reavers in the mind
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge been lighting music in more shows?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's...
On Earthly, it's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 21, and now it's time to reveal the winner of the Big Bomani Cage Match.
Tonight in the cage match we had The Zippers with All Around the World.
Let me play a little clip of that for you to remind you what this sounds like.
How is the Zippers with All Around the World?
And the other song we played was the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
All right, those are the two songs that were in the cage match tonight, and I am pleased to announce the winner is, by a pretty close vote, not too far apart, the winner is the Final Fantasy VII String Machine, ladies and gentlemen.
All right.
People have tape.
So the Final Fantasy VII String Machine will be added into the Orange Lounge playlist this week.
So check for that during the Bomani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we aren't here.
Sorry, JB.
Zipper's lost.
I want to kill everybody who voted for it.
I'll give you all the names after the show.
All right, and if you want a copy of that Final Fantasy VII remix, it's an Overclocked remix, so you can find it on Overclocked.org.
Or if you want the zippers, you can contact me.
So if you want the zippers, just contact JB.
Or anything else.
Anything?
Favors?
Like favors?
Oh yeah.
I think Mr. Spanky has some things he needs done.
That's quite a lot.
All right.
Does Mr. Spanky need to be spanked?
Some quick things.
Some things that have been coming through the chat room and some various little stories as the two hours have already passed that we've been on the air.
Just want to catch up, give everybody a fair chance to have their say on the show.
We had an email come in, a late FU come in over email, so I thought I'd read that for you guys.
Plus, we had a late one come in in the chat room from somebody who missed the first part of the show.
So I'm going to read those for you.
So over email...
We had an email from... Oh crap, I lost the email.
We'll get back to the email in a little bit.
Let me read the one from the chatroom.
DSCS SoCalKick says, F you to soccer for milking another $81 from his pocket and much more along with the next two Saturdays and my F you... Oh, and F you to his birthday for being next Monday.
That's not a bad thing to have a birthday coming up.
I thought that was a good thing.
You're alive to celebrate it.
That's right.
You should be glad you're alive to celebrate it.
Amen.
Oh, I'm sorry, JB.
It's in the microphone.
My birthday on June 15th, my mom sent me to Hollywood Ball Time for half an hour.
And then she said she'd get me a metal pad.
Well, F you to JB's mom for not following through on her promise.
Alright.
We got an F you over email.
Moohimer of New Jersey.
Moo!
Moo.
He says, a fuck you goes out to his mom, or, I'm sorry, not to his mom, I'm sorry.
A fuck you goes out to his room for being small.
That's what happens when I have the mouse over the R-O, I just assume it's another word that ends in O-M.
My bad.
Sorry.
That was a big fuck you going out to his room for being small.
Hey, what...
Nothing wrong with small rooms.
I have a small room.
It's all about stacking.
Stacking will save you so much space.
I've got like 400 DVDs, a whole bunch of movies, a computer, seven game systems, a queen-size bed, and I still have room to move.
And this studio that we do this very show in is very small, as JB learned for the first time today.
Is that how you go to Walmart and you get those stacky crates and put your stuff in them?
No, you go to Kmart, because remember, Kmart is my favorite store, I shot there cause I is poor.
Yay Kmart!
That was a cheer that they used to do in high school on the bus going to a band.
Pretty soon they'll be with Lint.
Oh, I have another FU.
Mooheimer had two FUs.
Please allow me to finish.
Also, fuck Swishy Pants, because they're annoying.
Swishy Pants!
They sound like fun pants.
That is so Seinfeld right there.
Swishy Pants!
What's up with that?
No, I remember it was with George, okay, and he had the pants that would rub next to each other, rub together because his legs were so fat.
So he'd go, as he was walking, and it was like one of these annoying things that they'd rant on.
I don't know.
I didn't watch it.
I wonder, what about DDR and SwishyPants?
That would be... Max 300 and SwishyPants, that would be funny.
God, we're getting more FUs a little late.
This is it.
No more FUs.
These are the last ones, alright?
FU to Raver's Groove or whatever.
DT was one of the poor unfortunate souls that got to hear Raver's Groove play on Orange Lounge about six times in an hour.
Let me play.
That song happens to be one of my favorites, okay?
And it's not my fault that that happened.
It's not the song's fault, so get over it.
And the Claus Show.
Alright.
I'd pick that song, dammit.
Let's see.
F you at late F yous.
Yeah, fuck the late F yous.
F you to kids on the pad while I'm playing and I'm like, bitch, get off.
Bitch!
23rd Magus says, this is Nephew, he has a little story he'd like to tell, please.
Here's a story of a lovely FU.
It's not an FU, it's a different one.
He said, this is how we celebrated 20 November.
Oh, this is late.
We need music, we need music.
This is a late 20 November story, I'm sorry.
Uh, I don't have 20, I have a teen November, that'll just have to work.
I don't have 20 November queued up and I don't feel like pulling up.
Uh, late 1920 November celebration story.
I went to the roof of the school and yelled out, Be money at the top of my lungs.
No, seriously, I did.
Yep.
And then I took the deer in the headlights looks.
Loser!
I mean... Hey now, be nice.
That was cool.
I think that's cool.
Especially the deer in the headlights parts.
Anything that will get you deer in the headlights looks are awesome.
Fabulous.
Fabulous.
Did he mention he was doing it dressed up like Mr. Spanky?
I don't want to see him dressed as Mr. Spanky, I'm sorry.
Alright.
Those were the late FUs and things of the week.
So there you go.
You can always send your FUs in a little early if you're not going to be here for the live show.
You can always send those over email, orangebronsradio at yahoo.com.
That's what Dave did tonight.
He got his in.
I have an important announcement to make.
Yes.
I got the hooker to have sex with me in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
Thank you very much.
Well, isn't that special?
Hookers are the work of the devil.
Alright.
Satan's little play pal.
Um, let's see.
I'm hoping the other people left, that we're in the house right now.
Are they really?
Oh, crap.
My roommate's girlfriend's parents are here right now, and Loki's just yelled out, I finally got the hooker to have sex with me!
You ain't got tact, even if you looked it up in the dictionary.
I'm going to get kicked out of my house.
Okay, let's move on.
Now I'm getting 20 November stories.
That's alright, we need something to fill up the show with.
SoCalKicks... No more Denny Ross!
SoCalKicks... SoCalKicks says... On 20 November, his friend broke his arm.
Aww.
That sucks.
I'm having a cry.
Your arm got broken and that's sad.
23rd Magus sends us a bit of randomness here.
He says, My English essay was titled, I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.
Hot, hot, hot.
That has nothing to do with 20 November, silly.
SoCalKicks wants to point out he broke his arm in soccer.
Not like jerking off or anything.
Although that would have been a lot more humorous, don't you think?
That would have been cool.
It would have been seriously...
either really clumsy.
That was so eight days a week, breaking your neck, trying to perform self-fallatio.
That's like clerks.
Okay, this one last one.
No more 20 November stories.
We don't care.
I'm just kidding.
DCB says he played Beatmania's second mix and got 100% greats on Overdoser.
You're special.
You are very, very special.
All right.
No more 20... What?
What?
This is actually Pomani-related.
Oh, dear God, what?
And because of 20 November happened to be falling on a Wednesday, there was a new Naoki Journal.
Yes.
Boo!
Yeah, well, they announced the new Naoki Underground song, which, I mean... Now, that's cool.
Okay.
Thank you for watching!
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
I'm so scared!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Caffeine pills?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, got it wrong again.
I love my job.
Alright.
Let's go to... Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling that.
We gotta do it again.
Yeah, where's the emotion?
Do it again.
This time we'll take the still photos.
No.
Once more.
Alright.
Alright.
Let's go to the news, because this is something that really, it doesn't have anything to do with Bomani, but it's kind of funny anyway.
And I know a lot of people that play Bomani eat a lot of fast food, and a lot of people also kind of play Bomani as a way to diet.
You know, some people play, I admit, when I started playing DDR, I thought it was cool because I was suddenly losing weight.
And of course, now that I haven't played DDR in about a month, I'm gaining it all back, but that's beside the point.
So I thought I'd read this funny little article and get your guys' thoughts on it.
Lawyers claim that Big Mac... Oh, I guess I need some music for this.
We need some news music.
No, no, DJ Ranma.
God, do I even have that in here?
Is that in the playlist?
I'm going to just play Journey to Wonderland.
Toasty burgers!
Where is it?
Toasty buns, there it is.
Alright.
This kind of goes with it anyway.
Okay, lawyers claim that Big Macs make kids fat.
Are Big Macs hazardous to children's health?
Lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's on behalf of New York children who have suffered health problems including diabetes and high blood pressure and obesity.
In a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, a lawyer alleged that the fast food chain has created a national epidemic of obese children.
Samuel Hirsch agreed that the high fat, sugar, and cholesterol content of McDonald's food is a very insipid, toxic kind of thing when ingested regularly by young kids.
The plaintiffs include a Bronx teen who ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while living in a homeless shelter.
Another is a 13-year-old boy from Staten Island who says he ate McDonald's food three to four times a week and is now 5'4 and 278 pounds.
McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman insisted that the lawsuit was a frivolous attempt to cash in on the Golden Arches, the kind of lawsuit that shouldn't be in court.
People don't go to sleep and then wake up obese, Lerman said.
The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and french fries do to us have been with us for a long, long time.
McDonald's has asked Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the case, arguing those who filed the claims cannot show their health woes were caused by Big Macs, and insisting the company has never misled customers about his food.
The judge did not immediately rule on the request.
All I gotta say is, fucking exercise, lazy bastard.
Shit, man, I eat fast food every day of the week, you know, and I'm not like some big tub of lard that's like walking around shit.
Get up and do something.
Don't just sit there and go, Me eat more burger!
Good!
You sounded like me for you just then.
Oh god.
Huh?
What?
JB's chastising Loki for... Anyway.
Yes.
So what'd you think about the Big Mac story?
First of all, McDonald's is disgusting and I haven't eaten there in easily four years.
Except that they had those really tasty bagel sandwiches.
DCB and Orange Beanie are in the chat room suggesting that the following should go along with this It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat It is a good place to listen to the music People flock here to get down to the rock music
Yes, rock and roll McDonald's, ladies and gentlemen.
See, if everybody would just rock and roll a little bit while they're at McDonald's eating Big Macs, maybe they wouldn't get so fat.
Well, you know, they put the nutritional information there easily readable.
You know, well, I don't know, maybe most of the people who eat there are illiterate, I don't know.
You know, those people eating those Big Macs are the same people who think that smoking doesn't hurt anyway.
The things that, I don't know, that the government's, you know, not corrupt and...
They have no tune with the obvious at all.
It's like, huh?
Those are unhealthy for me?
Don't you think someone would tell me that?
This goes back to people being really stupid, okay?
People are going to watch TV, and they're going to see this on there, and they'll think, oh, well, that looks dumb, even though they're basically looking at big piles of glycerin that are colored, you know, so they don't melt into light or something.
They're looking at this, and they're thinking, oh, well, that looks tasty, and it's so ingrained into society that the general masses, who are, unfortunately, really stupid, are going to fall for it.
You know what I think is very funny?
I don't know if this goes hand in hand, but since I stopped watching TV so much, I've eaten out so often.
At least at major chains.
There's this one lady that works at McDonald's that has no teeth.
The whole thing is that it's a matter of choice in using your brain.
And unfortunately, people just don't know how to use their brain.
They want to be sheep like everybody else.
There was this one chick at the McDonald's that we used to go to, actually.
It's just some Chinese chick with an eye patch.
We used to go, Arrgh!
Every time we'd get our stuff from her, it was quite funny.
That's kind of mean.
Arrgh, matey!
Hand over me Big Mac!
One thing I have to say about McDonald's.
One time I went to McDonald's, this one right by my work, and I ordered two hamburgers without cheese and without onions because I cannot fucking stand McDonald's onions.
That's the nastiest fucking shit on this earth.
Dehydrated onions?
What the hell is up with that?
They're awesome.
They're awesome.
I love them.
Gross.
Anyway.
Well, F you to Bradley for liking McDonald's onions.
Okay, so, I order my burger without cheese and without onions, right?
I get it back to work, I open it up, and what do I find?
I go, gosh, this hamburger seems awfully thin.
I bite into it, no meat.
I bit into two pieces of bread covered in ketchup and mustard and pickles.
Fuck McDonald's.
God.
But this is what happened.
My co-worker called them.
Since I'm kind of a pussy, I let people walk all over me like that.
My co-worker heard me show, I was running, of course, only the way I can do.
I started, you know, what's the first thing I'm going to do when I get a bad burger?
I run around and show all my co-workers, oh, look how McDonald's fucked me over.
And I'm like, well, let's eat a burger.
And I open it up where I took a bite.
And my co-worker's like, you're not going to put up with that crap, are you?
So he calls and he got me two free meals at McDonald's.
This was about six weeks ago and I still haven't used my free meals at McDonald's.
It's like, here, more poison for you.
So if you want a free meal at McDonald's, just go over to McDonald's on Madison and Hazel and tell them that... Never mind, I'm not going to tell you who sent you.
It's not under my name.
Madison and Hazel.
Alright.
They're dumbasses.
That was the same place I went there.
We're getting our meal and the guy's talking through the PA system out where the drive-thru stuff is.
He's like...
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, I know you can hear me, Kenny, meanwhile we're sitting in the window going, food, give us our food, Kenny, give me a six dollar burger, Kenny, Kenny,
Kenny!
Kenny!
I'm like, fucker, just give me the goddamn food!
It was like sitting on the back counter.
I could see it with my own eyes.
I'm like, can't reach food!
He's like, Kenny!
The guy was a fucking dumbass.
That's all I have to say.
Oh my god, they killed Kenny.
Ah, yes, Orange Beanie is saying, meat is bad.
Just be a vegetarian and don't eat at McDonald's at all.
Meat is bad.
Except I eat chicken still, but...
I used to date a vegan and it was really interesting going to McDonald's because they couldn't even eat the fries, really.
So... Oh, you gotta go?
Was that your pager?
Bye, JB.
Say bye to everybody.
Any closing thoughts from JB?
Ginny rum?
Ginny rum.
Thank you, JB.
Need pork, daddy!
I'm gonna get drunk and sue Budweiser Hey fat people, what's this one say?
Hey, Rob.
There's another headline I saw on Yahoo, because you know Yahoo has always the best headlines.
It was some stupid kid, they threw a flaming chair at this kid in the back of a pickup truck.
And this kid was part of it, and they were filming him.
It was one of those jackass... And he got hurt, and they said, oh, it must have been from a jackass stunt.
I'm like, what, so every dumb thing that stupid kids do and catch on camera is a jackass stunt?
Yes.
No.
I don't think so.
It's funny, doesn't he have a part where he can rate the top?
Loki don't play that.
I don't play that shit.
You know what I think?
I think that all those, back to the topic at hand, the fast food crap, I think that those places, actually, they need to be, if they were subsidized for having a healthy menu and high quality food, which they could still make just as fast as the cheap crap that, you know, is so bad for you, if they were offered a government subsidy for providing good food to people,
That would actually, I think, improve a lot of the health of their consumers and possibly get them repeat business, but the other thing is our government doesn't give a shit about it anyway.
Well, they've kind of improved their stuff.
I mean, they changed their fry recipe around to make it, like, a lot less oil and there's less fat grams and stuff in there, so they're doing stuff.
I mean, why...
Why?
I mean, we go there, we know what's in the food.
We know that it's not meat between those patties, or between the bread.
Even so, as a manufacturer, you do have a responsibility to your consumer.
What about if they just put a DDR machine in every McDonald's?
Two Big Macs and Shitty Rom!
What's that?
That's that game for fags.
Oh, I'm going to eat my burger.
Oh, heart attack.
Ugh, die.
It just has to do with people caring enough about themselves and being smart enough to know what's good for them.
Love yourself.
DarkSakura.com
Like, there's this bagel cafe place near where I work.
I can go there and get a turkey sandwich with avocado and no mayonnaise and everything, and that's nice and healthy.
Or I could go get, you know, freshly made teriyaki at another place just as fast.
You know, it's certainly more satisfying than going and getting a piece of bread that's been in a bag for five years and this piece of something that's supposed to resemble meat that, you know, probably still has the green ink stamp from when they stamped the damn thing in the first place.
and, you know, you can look at this, you can pay, you know, five dollars and get this unsatisfying, you know, piece of shit burger and, you know, this soda which you're actually paying about ten times what the value of the soda is.
Or you can go buy a bottle of juice and get yourself a nice sandwich and...
Overall, your body is going to thank you for it.
People who complain they don't have any energy, they're not going to have that complaint anymore because they're actually going to be fueling themselves.
There's the difference right there.
Also, there have been studies linked that prove that eating a consistent diet of fast food also does contribute to stupidity.
Your brain doesn't function as properly when you're eating nothing but shit.
Actually, I heard just the opposite.
They just did a study on the news saying that snack foods give actually higher test results during a short period of time.
That's not fast food, though.
The thing is, if you eat any carbohydrate, it's going to increase your brain function.
Bombay has another great suggestion in the chat room.
How about you cook instead of eating at a fast food place?
Exactly!
I'm just talking about for people like when you're at work and you haven't brought your lunch or something.
You know, there's alternatives.
Because I'm lazy and McDonald's takes two minutes to get, okay?
That's what it comes down to.
And I love their goddamn fries.
I can't stand the stupid people.
I can't stand to go inside there.
I can't stand to smell the ugly, nasty people that are in there.
The smell is horrible.
This also goes back to those people who are on those low-carb diets.
They don't realize that when they're eating no carbohydrates, they're actually killing themselves.
The state of ketosis, basically, is the state that your body goes into when it's about to die.
When it starts feeding on itself.
Those are the same... Okay, the same people that are making this argument right here are the same people who go and supersize their extra value meal and they get Diet Coke.
That saves them.
You know how many calories that saves them?
They're making Diet Vanilla Coke now.
Did you hear that?
I've seen it.
Say that you're going to Burger King and you're getting a Whopper.
First of all, a Whopper has a calorie count of 750 calories.
Your typical Whopper does.
When you add your fries to it, you're adding on another 300.
Right there, you have in your hands the entire equivalent of a day's meal.
I mean, an entire...
You have your whole day of eating in one meal.
Changing your coke from regular to diet, you're basically removing 200 calories of that.
That's incredibly stupid, but you know what?
That's how they make their money.
I drink 300 calorie hot chocolate.
You're getting some dairy from it.
Actually, it's instant hot chocolate.
They have enzymes in them.
It's so chocolatey and good, I can't deny it.
It's actually three packets of hot chocolate mix, because one and two are just not enough.
Also, chocolate is good for your endorphins.
It helps you release happy chemicals.
Sounds happy.
Yeah, it's a aphrodisiac.
Thanks for watching!
Maybe we should make this a regular thing, you know, health talk.
Health chat, DDR dieting, workout mode.
Well, seriously.
On Orange Lounge.
You know, it also goes hand-in-hand with playing, you know, the DDR and pata pata.
No, this is why I agree that this topic's kind of, you know, relevant.
It actually really is relevant to the Bonnie community.
Because, like I said, a lot of people play Bonnie to stay fit.
It's one of the things that appeal to them about the game.
And I'm mad at Golfland because they're trying to make me impotent.
Blank.
Link, they got rid of my surge and replaced it with Mountain Dew.
Mountain Dew's bad.
It tastes like pee.
I want my surge.
Oh my god, I don't drink... That's the nickname Mountain Spew.
That's all I ever drink is Mountain Dew.
Mountain Spew.
Does Mountain Dew really make you impotent?
It's just all the yellow sticks or whatever it is.
It isn't really going to matter for me anyway, but...
Ah, they're saying sushi is good.
And Orange Beanie says the only meat he'll eat is sushi on occasion.
And then Swift Rock says McDonald's should get sushi.
McDonald's would, then you'd get like, you'd get like the imitation crab wrapped up in cabbage instead of nori.
And an old bun to replace the rice.
If you, if you did get rice crackers and soak them in water.
Not, well, not, you know, the big rice cakes and soak them in water and then wrap those around a piece of imitation crab meat and cover it in cabbage.
I'm being told to look at a Gran Turismo Vice City story I apparently missed that was going on.
Gran Turismo Vice City, shit!
Let's see, um... You fucker, you're going faster, man, we're gonna kill you!
Okay, SoCalKick says he was watching Channel 4 and this was the explanation of Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
Did I say Grand Theft Auto?
I'm sorry.
Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
Oh yeah, that's right, there was supposed to be a news report on that.
Yes, on Channel 4 they said, in the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City, players must beat women, kill police, and have sex with prostitutes to progress in the game.
Uh, no.
Kill police, yes.
Oh, that's optional.
Cop killer.
That's optional.
I mean, I always just, you know, I fire lots of rockets and watch people explode.
This is how much I actually play PlayStation games, by the way.
You didn't catch my big fuck up there.
That's not like, you know, a one-sided opinion there.
Well, you have to do this to, you know, what, first off... If you want the bonus stage, maybe.
Oh, first off, it's a complete lie.
Okay, complete lie right there.
Just totally slandering the game right there.
Stupid bastards.
Oh well, it doesn't matter.
No matter what they say.
In fact, yeah, it's going to give them more ratings and more, you know, people are like, oh, cool, that game looks like fun and it's going to sell more copies.
It was the highest selling, highest grossing game last year, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3.
So now this time it's going to be even better.
And it has a storyline.
It has to do with a drug deal that went bad.
And you have to go kill the people that stole your money.
Well, thank you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DDR Max USA DDR Max USA
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There's no excuse for bad customer service.
And keep in mind this.
For every one person who calls in and complains or does a physical complaint, there are eight more people who are displeased.
And each of these people will go and tell more people.
The thing is, if we had more activists in the world, stuff would change.
And so I think that that's my part in trying to make things a little bit better.
So Jamie and I didn't get to play Max in front of a bunch of strangers and we cry.
I had a sniff.
But it was kind of interesting how Fries has really been promoting DDR around here especially.
I did have a run.
Because I literally, we watched what, like two or three people, at least I noticed this, I didn't really say anything to you about it.
But I saw, like, two or three people, no, not the ones playing the game, but, like, families picking up DDR and a dance pad, like, walking out there.
And the employees, this is kind of smart, they did have an employee kind of stationed near the DDR, watching the people play, apparently not keeping very good track, but watching the people play, and then when parents would kind of look at it curiously, would go up and talk to them about DDR, and suddenly they're walking out of there with a copy of Max USA, and one of them was walking out with a PlayStation 2.
My boss bought Konomics for herself.
See?
Make sure that you buy your games at GameStop.
Thank you.
Yes.
Buy them at GameStop.
Reserve your games at the GameStop in Richard Quarter.
Jamie's trying to get a little bit of business there.
For my man.
Yes.
Let me know.
I guess that's a really great way to promote DDR.
It's too bad more stores don't do that.
I also did find another couple cool things at Fry's, speaking of our little trip to Fry's.
Okay.
One of my favorite artists ever.
I didn't think that any of his stuff was released in the U.S., and I was wrong, because I found three DJ Crush CDs at Fry's.
That makes me happy.
And I saw the super ghetto cheap CD burners.
That made me happy.
Yep.
They were really cheap.
Yep.
Okay, so that was our Fry's story, and that's about it.
Oh, Loki has something to share.
Damn you Friesen making me sped money.
I go there with an intent of buying one thing and I walk out with eight things.
I hate you!
Being so cheap!
I got my man a really cool birthday present.
And by the way, we need to give, even though he's not listening and stuff, I have to give a happy birthday to my fiancé Dan, because he's absolutely awesome.
Aww.
Yeah, if ever you see him online, he's either online as NeoStrider, he used to run the NeoStrider Strider Zone, and he also goes by the handle GunstarHero a lot.
My man's an old school gamer.
But he's going to be 27 on Friday, and I got him a really cool gift.
I don't know if anyone has seen the little mini RC cars, like the Initial D cars and the Digi-Q cars.
Fry's are selling the Digi-Q tracks, the Japanese ones.
And that's what I picked him up for his birthday.
Uh-oh.
Boom.
So, happy birthday to my man, even though he's probably not listening.
And I hope he's not listening because I just told him his birthday present was.
That would be bad, yes.
I'm going to play some stuff for you.
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back to wrap up the rest of the show.
Let's start this one off with something a little bit disco.
I know you guys kind of like this song.
We'll play this for you guys.
And we will be right back.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You don't need another one No matter how much I get hurt
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
It's a good place to listen to the music.
You are back, and it's funny, in the chat room they're talking about this Gacked Another World sounds just like the Josie and the Pussycats song Three Small Words, and they're absolutely right, because that racked my brain for an entire day one time.
It's okay, but it's better.
Yeah, I like Another World a lot.
I mean, and it is different.
The chorus is a lot different.
We actually did play the Gagged version.
The guitar is just very similar.
The guitar is very similar.
We actually did play the Gagged version, by the way.
Which is the only good one that exists.
I was supposed to relay a message to Loki from SoCalKicks, but I lost it, so retype that in the chatroom, SoCal, and I'll get that.
No, I don't think it was more work.
I think it was something more about Grand Theft Auto.
Eh, stupid news.
All local news sucks because they're stupid and uninformed about anything current.
Especially anything that has to do with gaming.
Like, those crazy kids and their games.
They're so stupid.
Yeah.
That was special.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura.com
Why is VidPower suggesting Animal Crossing Vice City?
No.
That would be pretty funny though.
I'd be able to shoot Mallory finally.
I like Mallory.
I'd pop a cap in her ass.
I like Mallory.
Mallory gives me stuff all the time.
Now what would be crazy is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
But that's okay because I like puddles and you don't like her.
Black Lab wants to point out that the Boba at Boba, Max is broken.
We're going there for Boba.
Alright, we're going there for Boba.
That's fine.
We're still coming.
Alright.
Now this is what SoCalKicks wanted to tell you.
Loki, that's what they do.
Do you even know why every supermarket has milk in the back?
It's just like a mental thing.
Most people just go to a supermarket often just for milk.
If it's in the back, they have to go all the way to the back.
And then for some reason to pick up other things.
Yeah, it's because they, they, you know, arrange supermarkets and stuff to promote buying.
Duh.
But, I mean, that has nothing to do with the fact that, you know, they're saying the game is, you know,
Oh yeah, talking about Fry's, yeah.
Oh.
I think, I don't know what that was exactly in reference to.
Yeah, Fry's is like a giant maze.
It's like a giant hedge maze that you have to walk through just to get to the checkout counter.
Giant hedge maze, that's all you have to remember.
But it's not the fact that they arrange stuff like that, it's just the fact that they're so cheap.
So cheap that you can't resist.
But the problem is, they're all mail-in rebates...
PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3
Well, first thing I'm going to be doing is getting DDR Max 2 when that comes out.
So, you know, I can rip everything from that and whatnot.
But I'm also, one of the first games I'm getting, which I'm also bidding on, is Para Para Para.
I'm not...
Um, yeah, but there's, I don't know, there's a bunch of other games, like, you guys are trying to get me into Beatmania 2DX, and I'm thinking that's an expensive investment for something I'm not too excited to be playing, but, I don't know.
There's also the Drummania, um, drum, I wanted to get the drum set for that, and, uh, maybe Drummania or something, I don't know.
What was it again?
Session Mode is so cool.
Yeah.
Uh, being told that Grand Theft Auto Crime Online is said to be real.
Uh-oh.
Hide your children!
and Loki, you don't want Para Para, it gets boring in three days.
Actually, I'm not sure if he's talking about Para or Drum Mania, but he's saying, you don't want it, it gets boring in three days, that's DCB.
Well, I know that, duh, I don't play games like after three days anyways.
Another reason why I'd want Para Para is just for the controller, because I get to use it with Step Mania, and oh yeah, I get to put some crazy shit in there.
Basically, it'd be like a really tripped out version of Dance Maniacs.
They'll have to do it for now until I... He is talking about Para.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You got the name wrong.
I'm sorry.
The Pink Biscuits of Death.
The Pink Biscuits of Death.
I like pink pancakes.
They're too big to be pancakes.
They're fat pancakes.
Well, they were saying also that I should get, um, what was it, um, Kingdom Hearts International when that comes out.
And Final Fantasy International.
Hell, I can get Final Fantasy XI right now, I guess.
I don't know why I'd want to, but... Oh, he's...
Swiftrock is offering to give away his Parapara for a Milpitas Golfland token.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, go ahead and email the show at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll forward that on to Loki and you guys can set that up.
I think you might have a Golfland token to spare.
Yeah.
All right, cool.
I can get one.
Look up at the wall.
We actually have a Gothland token.
Yeah, there's a Gothland token sitting right up on the wall.
You can have that.
You can borrow it to get the para-para.
I'll just take two para-para controllers.
I mean, I think you can, like, do something with that.
You can play two people para-para.
Woo-hoo.
You can have a para-party.
Paraparty, it'll go well with the masturbation party.
By the way, by the way, by the way, MakeEditGetPorn is still on.
And, uh, yeah, I haven't really thought of a date yet that I want to judge everything.
I'm just being lazy, so.
In the meantime, MakeEdit, for anything that's on, MaxUSA.
And I don't care how you make it, just get me a step chart or edit file or DWI or step menu file somehow.
And, uh,
Yeah, and I'll enter it in.
You can do it!
And you can get porn!
Pornography.
Okay.
It's faptastic!
Yes, it's a faptastic contest being brought to you by the one and only Loki.
Ah, it's being suggested we should invite Paula Terry to our Pear Pear Paradise party slash masturbation party.
No.
God, no.
Unless we get to, like, take shots at her.
Alright.
She can't sing, but you know, if she were to be, like, I don't know, gagged somehow, I'll let your mind do the work.
You got some Paraparadise you can gag her with?
I got a pink biscuit for ya!
Stick the mic closer.
That's right.
Oh yeah, you know you like it.
Anyway, we're getting close to the end of the show here, so I thought I'd go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.
Dude, Matt, you are one sick fuck.
That's Jamie's final thought, is Matt is a sick fuck?
Yeah.
That's correct.
Loki, your final thought for the day.
Uh... I don't know.
I'm tired.
You're tired.
It's Gendo.
Oh, that's right.
My bitches will do anything.
Okay, well, maybe not that.
Bradley, have any... My women are always on top.
And...
Final Thought of the Day.
Run away, run away, run, run far away, and then run back.
What?
That was great.
That was great.
I didn't get it.
Gendo, are you a pimp?
No!
That didn't do anything.
I know.
I just like that song.
Attention, Kmart shoppers.
Attention, attention, Kmart shoppers.
This is Gendo.
Please report to my office for breast inspection.
Damn it, I hate this part.
Oh, baby.
I love the scene in that where Shinji's in front of the elevator and the elevator opens and it's the Gendo music and then it closes and the music goes away.
We're talking about an anime parody of Evangelion called Evangelion Re-Death.
It's completely on crack.
That's where the It's Gendo line comes from in the intro.
Yay.
And we're just quoting it because we can.
We're nerds.
The best one, though, has to be Fanboy Bebop.
That is, oh, so funny.
So funny.
It's like, it starts off, the whole thing shows this ship, and it shows, like, his anime collection, and it says, you know, like, Sailor Moon and stuff, and then it's all hentai.
And it shows, like, this long hallway full of videos, and it's all hentai.
It's hilarious.
Definitely watch it.
What else I have on that tape is Jube Powers, International Man of Intercourse.
It sucks, but I love the part with the looping ninjas.
That part was funny.
The looped animation of the ninja running in and out with the 70s porn music.

Oh!
Dude, we need to send her an email and get her to listen to the show.
