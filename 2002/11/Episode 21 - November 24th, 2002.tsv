1125	3487	Message for you, son!
3928	4829	Attention!
5789	9673	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
11294	16319	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19973	22895	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
23235	26398	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26978	29680	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
30240	33122	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33903	34323	Just kidding.
34523	36104	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36324	36985	In this episode...
42503	43744	Hey, any balls down there?
44044	46485	That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.
46585	49747	What's your favorite scary movie?
49767	50327	Showgirls.
51248	52428	Absolutely frightful.
52648	53229	What's yours?
53469	55950	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
56010	57231	Don't torture yourself.
57891	58731	That's my job.
58891	60612	Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!
60692	63774	I'll get you, my pretty.
63994	65315	And your little dog, too.
65735	66655	I know Kung Fu.
66996	69617	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69657	71438	Why did they have to take the word gay...
73700	75662	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
98117	98817	It's the bush baby.
124986	126927	Say hello also to our third wheel.
128328	129729	It's our tech master, Loki.
129749	130909	Hey, everybody.
132450	136072	And also in studio tonight, we have another few guests to say hello to.
136193	138474	Everybody say hello to... Who's got a microphone?
138714	139955	Say hello to Bradley over there.
140335	140575	Yo.
141055	141335	Yo.
141956	142916	What's up, my brother?
145898	150000	Also in studio, say hello to... Is it Jenny's bitch or is it Jamie's bitch?
150061	152002	We don't know, but the initials are JB.
152022	152062	JB.
154912	155933	That's all you want to say is hello?
156694	156894	Moo.
157334	157835	Moo, okay.
159776	161578	We'll be talking to everybody more a bit later.
161998	163360	We're just going to take a really quick break.
164140	166723	Any other opening thoughts from you folks here?
168484	171086	You know, I don't think the parrot noises pick up very well over the radio, actually.
172027	172468	I don't know, though.
172888	175030	You can hear a little bit of it?
175851	177052	I don't know, I don't listen to the show.
180430	181051	Oh, we have a brand.
181131	181451	Oh, oh.
181691	182312	Oh, you know what?
182472	184714	Everybody who listens at home, give me food.
185595	186376	You want food right now.
186416	188258	What were you craving before the show started?
188398	189319	Artichoke hearts.
189940	193203	I want a pizza with garlic sauce and artichoke hearts.
193263	194164	Is that a PMS thing?
195025	196807	Oh, bite me.
197888	199970	All right, we'll be right back after this very quick break.
230356	232485	I would like our listeners to know that Robin's eating balls.
232686	233509	They're big and fluffy.
277534	280076	Before we get into the next song, I'd like to make a real quick announcement.
280236	281496	Kind of tease our next segment.
281957	282877	Rob was eating balls.
283137	284618	Well, other than that, I was eating balls.
285499	292023	I'd like to announce that after these next two songs, when we come back to the next segment, I'm going to come out live on air.
294064	298307	It's time for me to come out of the closet, and I will be doing that live on air just after this next break.
300148	304050	So, just, you know, this is going to be historic radio right here.
304690	305531	We just want to let you all know.
315094	338650	You and I, in a little toy shop, buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got Set them free at the break of dawn, till one by one, they were gone Back of phase, box in the software, flash the message, something's out there Floating in the summer sky, 99, every day
494232	519533	99 dreams I have had, everyone a red balloon It's all over and I'm standing pretty, in this dust that was a city If I could find a souvenir, just to prove the world was here And here is a red balloon, I'll think of you and let it go
640004	642630	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
648740	649300	That's right.
650201	659845	As we promised during the last break, it's time for me to stop hiding secrets from everyone here assembled in the room and all those assembled in the chat room.
660045	662546	I need to stop lying to myself about some things.
666208	668269	I have to admit this live on air.
669870	672751	I like something that a lot of people say I shouldn't like.
676076	690627	and people are telling me it's wrong that I feel this way and that I like these kinds of things, but I have to say, you guys, I just can't get enough of it.
692788	695951	I really do like Politary's dive from Six Style.
697131	698713	There, I said it.
700694	703076	Oh my god, I'm so sorry, mom and dad.
705161	707663	I'm so sorry.
708404	709004	I hate her.
709805	711166	I wish she would burn in hell.
711847	715690	In fact, it still holds true, okay?
715710	718732	You don't know that all Apolitary fans are going to burn in hell.
718792	720234	Who are you to judge?
720274	721174	Don't judge me.
721635	722415	You don't know me.
722816	725418	I'm still holding a bounty for her dead.
726058	730342	Bring her head to me and you'll be paid with vast riches of the lands.
732143	732724	You don't know shit.
735431	735871	Ah, there.
736031	738032	I feel much better now that I've come out on radio.
740353	743695	That was so invigorating.
743755	744075	Thank you.
745075	746836	Oh, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
746996	747416	No, you're not.
747637	748817	You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.
748917	749617	Episode 21.
750018	752939	You're listening to All Apolitary all the time.
754349	755170	Before your ears bleed.
770140	771501	And that does make me sad.
772241	773162	That makes me sad.
774763	776644	Because I'm sorry, that is the best version of Dive.
776664	777204	Go have a cry.
777224	778865	Yeah, I will have a cry.
778885	780466	I'm going to go have a cry.
780567	782288	The B4U girls can sing better than her.
782768	783508	Oh, come on.
783568	784829	Oh, come on.
785049	786950	She cannot hold a key.
786970	788051	Neither can the B4U.
789152	789792	Yes, I can.
790453	792374	Which would make Super Eurobeat that much better.
794229	795531	That's my impression of B4U.
795631	798594	Hyper Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat.
798654	800536	It's got B4U and Politary.
800756	802118	What more evil do you need?
805261	809326	I'm sorry, are you going to say that to Mike?
809346	810307	JB's afraid of microphones.
810327	811809	We're not going to hear very much from him this show.
811829	812850	What are you doing here?
815586	818748	So, yeah, I was playing Dive just the other day on 2DX and I was like, you know what?
818868	820669	I like this song and the hell with the rest of you.
821549	827072	I don't like Politary either, but, you know, everybody's allowed one odd thing.
827152	830353	She needs to have a hello again moment.
830934	831814	Choke on a chicken ball.
833375	834035	And die!
835676	836816	You guys are so mean.
837877	838337	No, we're not.
838377	839098	We're being honest.
840138	841799	So... Totally so.
844068	845369	The show is sponsored by Propel
861005	861766	Okay, sim update.
861906	862567	Well, we can do that.
862847	867091	Let's see, obviously the most prominent thing going on right now is Herney Mix 3.
868012	872817	Entries are actually being accepted right now and until December 20th, so get your stuff in there.
874899	882007	No, I actually played Step Mania for the first time outside of your simulator, because I've played your simulator at various parties that you've been at and you brought it to.
882407	887410	Outside of your simulator, I actually sat down, I downloaded Stepmania, and I actually played it for the first time in I don't know how long.
888131	889111	And, you know what?
889372	890492	It's pretty damn cool.
890612	892033	I don't know what I've been missing out on.
892113	892333	Yeah.
892514	894535	But, um... Okay.
895097	902766	Anyways, yeah, actually, one of the things that's going to be coming up pretty soon in some of the updates for Setmania is support for Beatmania.
904107	905269	So that's going to be good.
905389	910735	So you're going to see support for Beatmania probably soon after will be Dance Maniacs and Poppin' Music.
910875	913018	And they'll be the all-encompassing Bimani Sim.
913338	913999	The word for that?
914479	914800	Squee!
916138	918120	So, look for that soon.
918660	922824	Other things that should be noted, visit DDRUK.
923104	926126	I mean, they've got tons of sync sets that they're releasing now.
926166	927708	They have pretty much everything.
927768	932252	They're doing some of the older 1 through 5 mix stuff, so go check that out.
933393	938877	Also, check out, I believe, in the DDR Maniacs chatroom, they're going to be hosting files.
939337	942660	They have 1zip, that's all the Monty Ruler stuff that he released in 2002.
944304	945524	Oh, they love us there, right?
945584	946625	If I remember that right?
948045	949145	Yeah, they love us there.
949925	950586	Big fans!
950886	951266	Big fans.
951286	952406	Yeah, big, big, huge fans.
953306	964429	So, just go check that out, because they've got, you know, his, all of his stuff for 2002, including the unreleased stuff, which I have, it's supposed to be in there in one huge zip, 111 megs, I believe.
964509	965449	Wait, this is Bomani Roller?
965649	965970	Bomani Roller.
965990	967670	I thought you didn't give a shit about that stuff.
968150	968630	I don't give a shit.
968650	970971	Because you just ranted a couple weeks ago about the whole diva thing.
971031	973152	I don't give a shit about his stuff, but other people might.
973332	973953	Other people might.
973993	974753	Alright, alright.
974793	975954	So, there's that.
976154	983477	Also out there floating around somewhere is the DDR Extreme skin for Step Mania, so go find that somewhere.
984077	985800	It's supposed to be, I guess... It's out there somewhere.
985860	986661	It's out there somewhere.
986701	987382	I don't know where.
987782	988563	Just go check that out.
988623	993769	But yeah, Tourney Mix 3 for sure is going to be... Definitely keep your eye on that.
993829	999777	They've got a bunch of categories, including one now that you actually have to pay to get into for those people that are really professional at making files.
1000208	1002469	I'm actually considering entering.
1002549	1003370	I'm not sure yet.
1004530	1006892	Now, you saw that I did my very first step file.
1007092	1007352	Yes.
1007612	1008493	My very first one.
1008533	1009253	You got to see it.
1009353	1010394	You know what's sad?
1010414	1011394	I mean, let's just put it this way.
1011594	1014336	I have to say your step file is the most synced step file I've ever seen.
1014676	1015977	Every time I play that, I get triple A.
1017310	1018171	I guess that's a good thing
1035011	1054858	It looks like the guy who wrote it is Raiden, I thought it was always spelled the other way around, but the real name is Steven Unfred, wrote this file about how to sync a DWI, well actually he's talking about DWI, not Stepmania, but it was very helpful for me to sync this file that I did.
1056178	1063239	So it was, you know, you had to go into Gold Wave, you had to count the beats and do a little math, but this thing kind of walks you through it, the logic and everything, and it was very helpful.
1063619	1066500	So props to this guy for writing the file, because that really helped me in syncing that.
1066520	1067200	Yeah, really sync.
1067720	1072141	Oh yeah, I will copy, yes, for those of you in our chat room, and if you're not in our chat room, why the hell aren't you?
1072461	1078502	You should get your booty on over to orangelounge.skie.cx, and then just click on chat.
1079862	1083423	And then that'll get you in our chat room, and for those in the chat room, I posted the link right there.
1083783	1084743	And aren't you lucky you're there.
1086211	1089035	See, other stuff that's going on right now.
1090216	1095742	See, well, it's not really, I guess, simulator related, but it is a pretty big thing.
1096042	1098285	DDRspot.com is relaunched.
1099807	1102369	So, you know, we'll definitely go check that out.
1102389	1103771	The site is beautiful.
1103791	1106574	We'll talk a little more about that stuff later.
1106594	1107295	And finally...
1111883	1122206	I don't know how to exactly describe this, but DDRPC character set 9 is released in... Okay, just spit it out, Loki.
1122226	1126588	Two new characters is Betty and Mr. Spanky.
1127608	1129689	Mr. Spanky, the DDR guy.
1129729	1132570	Mr. Spanky, the bondage queen.
1132910	1135571	This guy, I mean, what the hell are they thinking?
1137043	1137603	What is this?
1137824	1141846	I mean, they've got this guy who's like, he's in all leather, like straps, okay?
1142187	1146510	He's got a mohawk and big, like, huge lips full of lipstick.
1146870	1147730	Mr. Spanky.
1148291	1152253	And then you've got the chick, she's in all, like, leather and stuff with, like, horns in her hair.
1152654	1154235	I mean, that's some scary shit.
1154355	1157337	I'm trying to find the DDRPC site right now so we can bring it up.
1157357	1159698	Hey, what kind of sick fucks work at Konami of America?
1159739	1160699	That's all I gotta say.
1162100	1164321	Really sick people there.
1164381	1165602	I'm trying to find the DDR.
1165642	1166202	Sorry, you guys.
1166562	1166863	There it is.
1166903	1168283	Dance Dance Revolution product site.
1169704	1170945	And downloads.
1172465	1174967	And character downloads, because that's all they actually released.
1175027	1177288	They were too lazy to release songs.
1178137	1178718	That's okay.
1179458	1182141	Yeah, Jason Enos and Mr. Spanky.
1183062	1185004	The white man always smiting out the black man.
1185024	1186806	Did you notice that?
1187047	1187527	Look at that.
1187667	1196617	They also edited set number seven to remove the skull from Robbie and put this stupid, like, I don't even know what kind of head it is.
1197437	1198358	Why did they do that?
1198438	1203523	They have to edit the skull thing, but yet they have Mr. Spanky.
1203843	1208127	Well, we know where their focus lies in freaking Bondage Freaks.
1209207	1211750	Because those aren't the first ones that they've released that were Bondage Freaks.
1211770	1215573	You've got Kobe and Nikki who look pretty Kobe-ish.
1216774	1221358	But yeah, it's a sad day, but I don't know.
1221638	1222259	What can you do?
1222339	1222579	I mean...
1223197	1225779	Maybe we'll talk to Mr. Spanky later in the program.
1225839	1227841	Maybe Mr. Spanky can offer us some advice.
1229722	1233265	I think Mr. Spanky's a big fan of Orange Lounge Radio, actually, from what I hear.
1233725	1236087	So we'll talk to Mr. Spanky a little bit later.
1236327	1241231	Maybe Mr. Spanky will just kind of pop in during one of our breaks and offer you all some good advice.
1241651	1243893	Because Lord knows a lot of you nerds out there could use it.
1244153	1251375	Back on the subject of Tourney Mix 3, Rob's file there, he sent it over to me, and I decided to go ahead and do a background for him.
1252016	1253076	I actually like it.
1253136	1253956	It looks pretty cool.
1253976	1255037	It's very colorful now.
1255217	1255557	Which one?
1255677	1257177	The background for your song.
1257197	1257697	Oh, yes.
1258158	1260338	You did a very excellent job with that background.
1260738	1265060	I'll actually play the song I did in Etitude starting the next break, so everybody can hear it.
1265160	1266140	And I'm still working on it.
1266160	1267961	Although I'm not entering Tourney Mix 3 with that.
1268021	1271482	I'm still debating if I even want to enter it at all, because I'm shy.
1272142	1274683	Do it anyways, just do it in light if you're going to do it.
1274983	1275663	I mean, that's cool.
1275863	1278243	And I'm entering mine in Alien World.
1278743	1280584	I'm working on the subs actually right now.
1280924	1281964	So, it'll be cool.
1282144	1282644	Very cool.
1283484	1284804	Are you looking at something pretty, Jamie?
1285505	1288185	There was a piece of lint floating in the air and I cut it.
1289285	1291426	You really care about the Sim update, don't you?
1293126	1293866	Um, yeah.
1294406	1295967	I, the, what, the Sims?
1296447	1297547	Are you talking about Animal Crossing?
1298237	1298497	No.
1299257	1303098	Also, I'll be announcing this later on, something that has to do with my sim.
1304619	1309460	And a further evolution of my sim, we'll get into that later on.
1310740	1313461	Alright, so, sim stuff.
1313501	1315741	Yeah, so you are going to be entering Tournament Mix 3.
1316202	1317022	I'm debating it.
1317462	1321243	Jamie doesn't really play the sim, so you probably won't be entering Tournament Mix 3.
1323118	1323719	Gatchamanota
1345598	1350422	No, you could do a dance file to Schlagwerk, because nobody's ever done one.
1351263	1351643	Oh, really?
1352624	1353064	My bad.
1354946	1356287	Both the Terror and the regular one.
1356707	1357868	My bad, my bad.
1357888	1362612	I would pick one of the old, like the Mega Ranger theme song, if I had to.
1363757	1367938	Oh, we have a new person in our chat room that says that they also have this ferret.
1368598	1372439	Brack2000 also owns the infamous ferret that we like to play here on the show.
1373339	1375059	Jamie likes to stroke it here on the show.
1375159	1375699	I'm sorry, JB?
1376019	1376579	Bush Baby.
1376959	1377540	Bush Baby.
1380220	1381940	It just had a fun time.
1382741	1386261	Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you'd want to hear that wonderful news that Bush Baby has a twin.
1386521	1387481	Bush Baby has a twin.
1387681	1388342	It's Robzo.
1388802	1389442	I just play with it.
1389662	1390522	It was a present.
1392475	1396342	I also ended up in somebody's lap here while he was quite drunk.
1396503	1396723	What?
1396843	1397504	No, what?
1397524	1397745	What?
1397805	1397885	Oh.
1406787	1407848	We need to do another drunk show.
1408128	1408748	We really need to.
1409028	1410829	You know, we're going to have to pre-tape a show.
1411149	1414310	So I'm thinking we ought to pre-tape a drunk show at some point.
1414510	1415270	That sounds like a winner.
1415290	1419012	That might be a winner because I'm actually going to be gone the week between Christmas and New Year's.
1419112	1422233	So we'll probably do some kind of pre-tape drunk show.
1422273	1425034	What more appropriate time than the holidays to be doing a drunk show?
1425354	1425795	Oh, right.
1427515	1428136	So we'll see.
1428716	1429096	We'll see.
1431257	1431537	All right.
1433345	1434446	That's nice, twin.
1435787	1436187	Yay.
1437248	1437849	Hooray.
1438289	1438970	You're special.
1438990	1439790	Go shave your hands.
1442941	1443742	Let's see.
1444643	1445904	What else should we talk about here?
1445984	1449407	Let's talk about... No, we're not going to talk about J-Rom.
1452029	1463719	Let's talk about... Since this kind of goes along with the whole Sim thing, and Loki was alluding to this a little bit ago, there's a brand new version of DDR out there that you may not have heard of.
1464519	1465660	Because it's not official.
1465961	1467081	It's quite a bootleg.
1467882	1472504	But I know you all out there have always wanted to dance to Britney Spears.
1474004	1476605	And you've always wanted to dance to Eminem and Christina Aguilera.
1476625	1477626	I feel sorry for you people.
1477766	1479727	Loki, tell us more about DDR Top Hits.
1480687	1485149	It's a piece of crap that they, you know, made very...
1486397	1486837	I don't know.
1487237	1489419	They didn't really put much work into it, it looks like.
1490319	1494981	It's basically a hacked fourth mix upgrade that they made, and it's crap.
1495402	1497983	They just replaced the images and replaced the songs.
1498243	1500304	It doesn't even look like they even touched the steps at all.
1500504	1502305	So, it's a piece of crap.
1502365	1505106	It's got, like, Christina Aguilera in it, Britney Spears.
1505126	1506267	That makes it a piece of crap instantly.
1507508	1509008	It's just sad.
1509428	1510329	Very, very sad.
1510689	1511510	I see No Doubt.
1511530	1513991	I wonder if that's old school No Doubt or new school No Doubt.
1514011	1514431	What do you think?
1516855	1517495	I don't know.
1517936	1518436	Who knows?
1518496	1519076	Who cares?
1520156	1521197	It's just, it's crap.
1522197	1541123	It's, what they, now, on the actual website, ddrtophits.com, you can actually see they have screenshots there, and if you look really closely on one of them where it shows the song selection screen, you'll actually see one of the songs that's, I believe, Boyz by Britney Spears, it says 1-2-3-4-0-0-7 as the actual song title.
1543144	1546547	because they're dumbasses and don't know actually how to hack the stupid thing.
1547948	1548588	It says boys.
1550650	1552971	And it also has the Dance Mania banner, might I add.
1553292	1556034	So doesn't this look like a bad Photoshop job to anybody else?
1557566	1561109	No, actually, that's what I was alluding to earlier.
1562290	1574261	I was talking with our fellow DDR tech guy, Keith, down in Scandia, and they were actually, sadly enough, talking about upgrading their fourth mix to this piece of shit.
1574922	1576043	So I talked them out of it.
1576743	1579744	I was like, I was like, I thought, hell no.
1580284	1595667	So what we're going to do, and actually next week, Keith is making me copies of the Flash ROM, the game CD and the install CD, and I'm going to hack a Max 2 machine, and we're going to make my own custom mix in the arcade.
1596247	1600248	Now, how pompous and cocky of you to be saying that you're going to be able to accomplish this.
1600588	1602769	Do you really think you're going to be able to get in there and hack all the data?
1602909	1603949	Why hasn't it been done yet?
1604609	1607270	If it's possible to do, why hasn't somebody else done it yet?
1607290	1608330	Why haven't the Japs done it?
1608350	1609571	The Japs always do it first.
1610251	1614632	Well, for one, over here in America, all these machines are illegal.
1614852	1618113	So really, there's nothing they can do about the fact that I hacked a fucking machine.
1618133	1618873	What are they going to say?
1619053	1620894	Oh, this music's not supposed to be on here.
1620934	1622434	Well, because it's not licensed.
1623155	1626596	Well, neither is any of the music that's on any of the import machines, so there's nothing really they can do.
1626796	1627616	Suck my dick!
1627876	1628416	Exactly.
1628536	1630877	So there's nothing that they can really do as far as that.
1631477	1636160	Now, hacking a machine is slightly complicated, but it can be done.
1636180	1637501	Now, there's a song you should put on there.
1637821	1640063	Why you gotta go and make things so complicated?
1640903	1641043	No.
1641283	1641624	Anyways.
1642124	1642905	But it can be done.
1642945	1643825	I mean, look right here.
1643885	1647507	We can definitely see that images and music is a piece of cake to do.
1648088	1653191	And the actual game data itself, the actual program, is only like 30 megs.
1653571	1655072	It's all on a flash ROM.
1655313	1656653	A flash card, actually.
1656713	1658835	Just a normal 32 meg flash card.
1659455	1660155	And it's pretty easy.
1660255	1664817	Plus, he's also having a few friends of his who are, you know, crackers and that kind of stuff.
1665398	1666678	Now, I'm not talking about white guys.
1666738	1670080	I'm talking about actually people that crack software.
1670220	1672621	They're going to be, you know, doing the same thing.
1672841	1674502	So, no looking at it.
1674682	1682825	I really think it shouldn't be too hard since, you know, my knowledge of making edits and that kind of stuff and actually working with just reverse engineering all this shit to do it.
1683025	1683926	Sure, it will take time.
1684866	1692852	I need to actually look at the game CD and stuff to figure out how the stuff's stored and that kind of junk, but I think we can do it.
1693132	1694533	So this is your new project?
1694553	1695274	This is my new project.
1695294	1696235	Your new time waster.
1696295	1697375	My new time waster, yes.
1697796	1704020	But at the same time, other cool stuff that I'll be able to do with these game CDs that he's given me is rip all the videos for Mac 2.
1704621	1709244	Everyone's been trying to do that, ripping the videos off of DDR USA, but I'm actually just going to rip them off of Mac 2.
1710185	1713087	What I'm planning to do is actually reskin the whole thing
1713627	1714909	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1735429	1743293	We were just throwing around a bunch of ideas because actually, for instance, people would think, okay, there's limitations on what you can put on one of those things since it's all stored on CD.
1743893	1750596	Well, not exactly because you can replace the CD-ROM drives with hard drives and then you can just stick, oh, look, 120 gigs worth of stuff on there.
1750976	1753717	You can actually have a DDR mix with everything on it.
1754538	1755638	So it can be done.
1755758	1757379	Loki makes Konami cry.
1758020	1758561	Oh, yeah.
1758601	1769723	Well, see, Konami would be the only one to get pissed about this stuff, or the RIA, but then all they'd have to do is they'd have to remove every machine in the United States, which... So you could possibly be fucking it up for everybody.
1770689	1771089	Oh, yeah.
1771369	1771649	Oh, yeah.
1771689	1771990	Hello.
1772530	1773730	I'm fucking up for everybody.
1773850	1778052	I'm not selling my fucking mix on the internet for $1,495.
1778232	1780032	Yeah, I'm not selling.
1780052	1781873	This is going to be exclusive to Scandia.
1782253	1782633	Okay?
1782973	1784634	This is exclusive to Scandia.
1785134	1790296	So there's only going to be one... So if you're out there listening to me, you know exactly where to come and arrest Loki.
1790716	1791957	Hey, okay.
1792577	1795078	Just because I make the thing doesn't mean I'm responsible for it.
1795118	1798179	That's like trying to sue the gun manufacturer for a murder.
1798339	1798539	I mean...
1799935	1805258	Just because I make it doesn't mean I'm assuming the risk for actually running it in an actual arcade.
1805518	1809380	This is all scandia, so if things go down, they're going down, not me.
1809921	1811762	Loki's going to ruin DDR.
1811882	1813363	Loki's going to ruin DDR.
1814163	1814984	Yeah, but guess what?
1815624	1819646	Another thing is I will be able to get copies of all these game CDs and stuff.
1819666	1823549	I have the hookups, basically.
1823869	1826590	And so right when we get extreme, too, same thing with that.
1827131	1827311	So...
1828211	1830156	Well, I need to figure out now the really tough thing.
1830236	1831118	What the hell do I put in it?
1832562	1833825	You should just copy your sim over.
1834935	1835616	A lot of shit.
1835676	1837677	No, screw that.
1838017	1839958	We'll advise you on what songs need to be in there.
1840038	1844921	Okay, but here's another thing that we're also going to, since it is going to be a Max 2 machine, I'm going to have unlocks in there.
1845081	1846682	I'm not going to tell anyone what's going to be unlocked.
1847003	1847523	Let me put it this way.
1847543	1850145	It's going to be a lot of points, a lot of songs unlocked each time.
1850585	1852446	I'm going to have also custom monies.
1852666	1861372	Maybe, I'm thinking, you know, what it's looking like is probably going to be DDR USA stuff, or Max USA stuff, I should say, and Euromix 2 and Euromix 1 stuff.
1862831	1864712	and Jenny Rome, I guess, and Beat Mania.
1864752	1866812	Well, I mean, I can talk, you know, this stuff.
1866852	1868733	I have to actually get into looking at it.
1868813	1874315	Well, but the first step you've got to figure out, you've got to be able to replace, like, at first you've got to go, like, you start little baby steps.
1874375	1875815	Okay, I'm going to replace one song.
1876215	1877596	I'm going to see if I can replace one song.
1877816	1879276	We need DDR 2DX style.
1880336	1880897	That'd be cool.
1881257	1885498	You need to go, and then he'll go and start ripping the 2DX discs.
1885558	1886878	That'll be his next project.
1886938	1891800	Well, I mean, it sounds like a major undertaking, but I think if I can pull it off,
1892495	1898680	Other than the fact that it'd be really cool because we'd be the only arcade in the United States that have custom mix.
1899320	1900961	Ah, decent question from the chatroom.
1901502	1904724	If you can hack an arcade version, why haven't you hacked a PlayStation version yet?
1905184	1906005	Or a Dreamcast version?
1906678	1909521	I haven't even tried.
1910182	1910882	Well, here's the thing.
1911283	1913125	People have hacked the Dreamcast version, by the way.
1913505	1916328	And actually, they're a little different from each other.
1916588	1921813	I mean, the arcade versions, they actually store the music on a CD a little bit different than they would, you know, an actual...
1922974	1926495	The arcade versions and the PlayStation versions are, like I said, very different.
1926535	1930876	There's a lot of things you can change on an arcade version that you can't change on a PlayStation version.
1931257	1934097	I just think just the way they store the data is going to be a little different, too.
1934738	1939279	Sure, I guess we could try hacking a PlayStation version, but I'd rather do the arcade.
1940079	1945281	The Dreamcast ones will be easier to do though because it's more compatible with the Windows environment.
1945301	1946002	Yeah, it's Windows CE.
1946802	1949643	No, they're not running Windows CE, but they're more compatible.
1950083	1961228	The thing about Dreamcast games is that they're not running in Windows CE unless they boot up Windows CE at the beginning of the game because it's actually loading Windows onto the Dreamcast every time you boot the game.
1961877	1963559	Yeah, but I don't know.
1963719	1964620	We're going to look at it.
1964860	1966522	I'll see how feasible it is.
1966602	1971748	I'm getting copies of 4th Mixed Stuff and Max 2, so we'll go from there.
1972869	1973790	Sounds like fun.
1974511	1977454	All I ask, you need to put... Oh, Nick, please not so quick back in DVR.
1978054	1978475	Don't worry.
1978695	1982960	I was going to bring back everything, including Telephone Operator, because I love that song, and they didn't bring it back, so...
1984488	1986109	I like it just because it's a lot like the original.
2004898	2005418	Are you okay?
2006179	2007559	Jamie has a medical emergency.
2008519	2010700	But, yeah, that's an idea.
2011821	2016342	I mean, we'll see how hard it is, and when I get done with it, you know, we'll see.
2016442	2017843	I think it can be done.
2018103	2019404	I don't think it's going to be too difficult.
2019504	2020604	These idiots can make one.
2021224	2029427	I mean, obviously, they didn't go into great detail of actually hacking the program and changing some of the steps or anything, but, you know, never know.
2029588	2030508	It shouldn't be too difficult.
2032443	2034485	Let's see, we're looking... Are you going to be okay there, Jim?
2035325	2035425	Oh.
2035706	2036246	Bike it in!
2037107	2037447	Hooray.
2038288	2042691	So what else... What do you guys... The other folks here in the chatroom, what do you guys think... Or the... Not in the chatroom.
2042932	2044813	Well, if chatroom wants to share too, that's fine.
2044853	2048456	But what do you guys here in the room think about this DDR Top Hits?
2049197	2050297	Your guys' opinions.
2050357	2050538	Like...
2051238	2052098	It makes me want to throw up.
2052119	2052519	It's going to suck.
2052539	2055040	Look at the fucking banner for just the beginning there.
2055300	2055980	It's like blue.
2056000	2058821	They probably don't have any artists.
2058842	2060442	They're probably a bunch of programming nerds.
2060602	2061843	They have no art people.
2075816	2080102	I just think they're stupid and don't know jack about they just threw this shit together.
2080342	2082845	You think if you're gonna sell something, at least make it look good.
2082885	2084467	I mean, I don't know.
2085248	2086730	I could do a way better job than them, that's all.
2087091	2089194	Black Lab's calling this DDR Mishits.
2090993	2093136	No, I'll name it something.
2093216	2096200	It's the Total Request Live version of DDR.
2096360	2097341	I'm talking about Topic 2.
2097561	2099404	It's like, okay, what do you want to see in DDR?
2099544	2102508	Okay, well, people obviously have said V before.
2102568	2103809	Oh, well, the steps for V suck.
2103989	2105912	You should just call it DDR that doesn't suck.
2107374	2108655	DDR that doesn't suck.
2110137	2115481	No, I was going to call it maybe like DDR Unauthorized or some shit like that, I don't know.
2115881	2118983	Redband DDR, Porno DDR, no, I guess you can't have that.
2119003	2120424	DDR XXXtreme.
2120504	2122146	DDR XXXtreme.
2122786	2126028	We'll even put Max the XXXium in there just for the hell of it.
2127189	2128410	Put like a song called that.
2129831	2131072	We could put crazy stuff in there.
2131372	2132473	This DDR sucks.
2137145	2137585	I don't know.
2137605	2141366	Well, we just have to see, you know, how feasible this is.
2141386	2142486	Can I be the new announcer?
2142746	2143947	Can we hack the announcer voice, too?
2143987	2144647	I want to be the announcer.
2144667	2145547	Actually, you can.
2145747	2147647	We can hack the announcer voice.
2147827	2151708	I don't really... I was just thinking about using just, you know, what's in there right now.
2152428	2156649	Obviously, we can probably steal the stuff from, you know, Solo or whatever.
2157790	2158310	Warning!
2158370	2159830	This game causes cancer!
2160090	2162090	We need the squirrel that goes, Whee!
2163211	2163811	No, you know what?
2163871	2164171	We may...
2165822	2168523	We maybe need to get Jamie to, like, do the voices.
2168844	2172846	Because, you know, we haven't had a real, like, bitch in DDR since the solo nurse.
2173206	2176948	So Jamie needs to just get up there and go, You make Captain Jack cry!
2177108	2178268	You've got no rhythm!
2178949	2180469	I talk like I'm in a tin can!
2182510	2183451	Yeehaw!
2183791	2185232	That's in your mix, too, actually.
2185752	2186432	Sadly enough.
2187133	2187493	Really?
2188373	2188694	Cool.
2190755	2192295	Oh, your dance makes me wet!
2193356	2193696	Max!
2194456	2195297	The porno mix!
2196857	2198518	I did not want to play DDR in here myself.
2199079	2200600	No, we need the Ridge Racer announcer.
2200640	2201961	We need to rip lines from Ridge Racer.
2202422	2202862	I like that one.
2203142	2204924	You dance like a drunken crack whore.
2205985	2207226	You are a drunken crack whore.
2207246	2207866	Get out of here!
2208707	2210268	You step like a dog pisses.
2210668	2211829	Bitch better have my money.
2213571	2214772	You step like dog piss.
2216613	2217794	Well, let's just... You know what?
2217834	2219476	Come to think of it, I know DCB isn't here.
2219516	2220677	I don't see him in the chat room tonight.
2221117	2223699	But we ought to just take out the announcer and just put in Wesley Willis clips.
2224520	2225100	Welcome to London.
2225260	2225821	Welcome to Chicago.
2227426	2228507	Nobody's going to get that, sorry.
2229747	2231188	I apologize for killing the topic.
2232409	2236311	Where do they get off charging $1,500 for this each?
2236771	2237191	They don't.
2237391	2237831	I don't know.
2238032	2240773	Unless they're selling full machines, no upgrade is worth that.
2240873	2244295	We didn't talk about some of the fabulous songs that you can play in DDR Top Hits.
2244335	2246236	Let's name some of these gems, shall we?
2248072	2262551	Featuring top US artist Britney Spears with Boyz and Krazy Boyz, I haven't heard Boyz, but you know, Krazy, maybe, but those aren't exactly, you know Let's see, Oops She Didn't Again, or what was the other one that she did?
2262892	2263192	Who cares?
2263212	2265255	Boyz was a song that she played in Goldmember
2266055	2267615	Beyonce Knowles, Work It Out.
2267735	2269116	Isn't that a rather new song?
2269136	2269996	I don't know.
2270256	2273877	I thought that song just came out a little while ago, so they've been working on this right up until right now.
2273957	2275817	Out of My Head and Fia.
2276177	2277178	Eminem, Without Me.
2278338	2279018	Pink, Most Girls.
2279078	2282459	Pink, Most Girls, Ricky Martin, Cup of Life, La Vida Loca, She Bangs.
2282799	2287240	Now, see, the people who worked on this obviously have a Ricky Martin fetish, because there's more Ricky Martin than anything else in here.
2287260	2288780	You know, most of the songs on there I've never heard.
2289061	2289961	Ricky Martin.
2290001	2294562	Cup of Life sucks, Livin' La Vida Loca is crap, and She Bangs is shit.
2295463	2297327	Although, don't you want to say that you dance to She Bangs?
2297387	2302238	Actually, Cup of Life and La Vida Loca I have heard because I have Samba de Amigo.
2303040	2304824	Imagine the video for She Bangs.
2307693	2312996	We'll get the fucking... Wait, are you going to make new movies for the Loki mix or whatever?
2313136	2317958	Actually, I was thinking of putting 2DX videos for some of them in there.
2317998	2320060	But yeah, we could put random videos.
2320080	2321781	We could have the ferret in there.
2321881	2322341	I don't know.
2322701	2323902	Whatever the fuck we want to do.
2324142	2325623	This is pretty much what we want to do.
2325763	2330266	I'm actually surprised that they're going to go and actually do something.
2330286	2331666	We'll just rob like Captain Jack.
2333007	2336568	Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left.
2336628	2339669	I'm just surprised that they're actually willing to do something like this.
2339729	2347351	I mean, that's kind of ballsy, I would think, you know, just to like say, ah, you know what, we're just going to put some hack fucking arcade game in our arcade.
2347391	2350752	It's just like, I don't know, if Jason Enos saw that.
2353312	2355413	Your hack makes Jason Enos cry.
2357253	2361496	All I gotta say, though, is if they're gonna fucking punish me, just give me a fucking job at Konami.
2361956	2362456	Seriously.
2362737	2368140	Oh, is this what the point is behind it, to say, either you're gonna hire me, or I'm gonna fuck you up?
2369141	2375765	No, this is what it's gonna say, is, well, if you're gonna take so long to make a fucking, you know, DDR mix, and you just say, I'm gonna do it for you!
2375865	2381168	And then I'm gonna say, ha, you suck, because my mix owns all of you, and you just suck ass.
2381389	2381949	Oh, look at this!
2382269	2385591	My mix is more popular than the Extreme Machine in Scandia.
2386292	2386852	Oh, you suck!
2386912	2390734	I don't know how hard it would be to convert the characters over from DDRPC.
2390794	2392254	We could put Mr. Spanky in training mode.
2392274	2392514	Maybe.
2416818	2417118	All right.
2417478	2420599	We'll put a video in the background with him whipping Betty or something.
2420619	2423000	Or no, Betty whipping him because he looks like a bitch.
2424780	2425941	Nelly with Hotton here.
2426741	2431482	Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams, Shakira, and many more.
2431522	2432662	Mariah Carey, that crap right there.
2434903	2436784	I'm sure it'll be as wonderful as Glitter.
2437584	2441465	It'll be as wonderful as the DDR Fifth Mix solo also.
2443673	2448654	Alright, oh yes, the DDR5 mix solo, what the hell was that all about?
2449155	2452556	Did anybody ever purchase that to see if it worked or anything?
2453376	2455096	No, but it's probably the same thing.
2456397	2457497	Laser Force should die.
2457517	2459117	Yeah.
2461198	2465839	Alright, let's see, they didn't hack all the songs in this though.
2466219	2467520	No, they left in Butterfly.
2467960	2472021	They left in Butterfly, for whatever reason, because Butterfly is poppy fun, I guess.
2473692	2476333	Alright, we're going to take a real quick break.
2476414	2484978	As promised, I'm going to play that song that I did my very first step file for because, yeah, I'm a co-host on this show and I can do things like that when I want.
2485839	2489020	And then we'll hear some other stuff and we're going to come back and talk about more fun things.
2489080	2490441	Oh, we have a new game to play tonight.
2490461	2491562	Maybe we'll do that after the break.
2491602	2491942	I don't know.
2492082	2492442	We'll see.
2492782	2493943	We'll see if you guys have been good or not.
2494523	2496344	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2496404	2499026	We will be right back, everybody.
2539522	2540524	Thank you for watching!
2637396	2642546	In the game, Drew Moore, since the day the bank was in Way back when, I've been putting it down Ask the Holy Ghost about it, get your list out of town
2892761	2897164	And now here's something we hope you'll really like, Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
2897684	2900907	Hello everybody, this is Mr. Spanky.
2901747	2907311	I hope you're enjoying getting to play me in the newest version of DDRPC.
2909373	2914397	And now I'd like to present to everybody out there Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
2915441	2919166	Today we're going to talk about planning a masturbation party.
2920168	2926917	Because everybody knows that Mr. Spanky likes to attend masturbation parties with his friend Betty.
2930339	2936864	Mr. Spanky would like to remind you that when you're planning a masturbation party, do not forget the latex.
2937264	2945870	You should get several boxes of latex gloves as well as a wide variety of condoms, both lubricated and unlubricated.
2946671	2948933	Also, pick up some dental dams.
2949753	2954477	Even if people keep to themselves, the latex can add a new dimension to the fun.
2955297	2961368	If the masturbation gets interactive, the latex is absolutely necessary to keep things safe.
2962891	2965776	Are you enjoying my masturbation tips, DarkSakura?
2969546	2972087	Are you enjoying my masterbass and pips, Loki?
2975810	2977331	I was just checking, thank you.
2977692	2979213	I've been a naughty boy this week.
2981054	2983676	I'd also like to remind you to lube it up.
2984096	2986358	Get plenty of water-based lubricants.
2986838	2990261	You may want to opt for single use packets rather than big bottles.
2990781	2997847	It will cost a little more but it's a lot neater and cleaner and guests will be happy to have their own lube supplies.
3000589	3009877	I'd also like to remind you to cover your furniture and even the floor with seats so that will make people more comfortable and help keep things tidy.
3011778	3014420	You like to keep things neat when you masturbate, don't you?
3019975	3024198	Lastly, Mr. Spanky would like to urge you to clean up.
3024979	3028861	Because nobody likes a messy masturbation thing.
3030562	3034265	And we all know that a masturbation party can be quite a mess.
3034725	3039328	Especially if you're masturbating to DVR in the nude.
3040709	3041910	That's really messy.
3045452	3047634	Remember folks, don't let DVR be your bitch.
3048982	3055788	Remember to use baby wipes, tissues, and paper towels, and they should be provided in abundance.
3057469	3060531	You need to use these things to clean Mr. Spanky's bank.
3061912	3069639	Things are bound to get messy, but having the necessities immediately at hand can decrease the carnage considerably.
3070677	3074539	You should also set up several dress chants around the play area.
3075219	3079981	Line them up with plastic bags for easy and safe disposal.
3080321	3086604	Remember to take inventory on your sex toys in case something gets lodged somewhere and you lose it.
3086964	3091526	Excuse me, excuse me, is your name Mr. Spanky?
3091586	3093647	No, I'm Mr. Spanky and these are my tips.
3093927	3095648	Oh, someone's a little pissed off.
3095668	3099410	Did someone get a hamster stuck up their sphincter and just kind of forget about it?
3101278	3102359	Were you at that party?
3102659	3104020	I didn't see you at that party.
3105221	3107422	Oh, you were one of the masked people, weren't you?
3107482	3108463	Oh, I understand.
3112266	3113487	Is your name Valencia?
3116268	3119030	That does it for Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.
3119210	3125135	Please enjoy me in the new DDR Character Pack, number 9 for DDR PC.
3125535	3128337	And now, I'm taking you back to that crappy radio show.
3142945	3143449	Remix
3197188	3199951	Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?
3200011	3203875	Roll the sound stick and move it with your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat and kill them all Damn, what am I gonna do?
3203895	3204476	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3204496	3204996	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3205076	3205937	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3205997	3206618	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3206638	3207318	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3207339	3207919	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3207939	3208600	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3208620	3209481	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3209501	3210081	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3210101	3210602	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3210622	3211223	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3211243	3212043	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3212584	3213225	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3213245	3213765	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3213785	3214366	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3214386	3217449	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3217529	3218350	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3218370	3218950	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3218970	3219591	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3219611	3220352	Damn, what am I gonna do?
3231304	3238088	It's really funny.
3239969	3241550	They should put the catch-up song in DDR.
3241570	3242971	Please, Loki, please, please, please.
3243411	3246033	Actually, that was one of the songs planned to be in there.
3246053	3246533	All right, cool.
3247013	3247274	Anyway.
3248955	3252637	It's going to be a long, long, long time before we ever see anything, though, right?
3254238	3258809	I plan on saying, yeah, at least six months.
3259711	3260132	At least.
3260232	3260513	At least.
3260553	3260834	All right.
3260914	3262117	Well, we'll be looking forward to that.
3262517	3263861	We'll see updates as they go.
3264938	3268681	Anywho, it's funny, the catch-up song, there's another funny story I have about that.
3268721	3276787	Last night I was out at the club and the DJ put that on as the very last song and says, I really hate this song, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
3277748	3283693	And then nobody knew the catch-up dance, so I wish Dave had been there so he could have done the catch-up dance, because he's the only person I know that knows it.
3284033	3284633	I only know this.
3285494	3285714	Anyway...
3286855	3287935	That's my catch up story.
3287975	3288296	Thank you.
3300347	3301688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3330667	3333148	If you want to send me your fuck you's of the week, go ahead and do that in the chat room.
3333168	3335028	Just PM them over to Sky.
3335768	3338609	And remember, if they don't come over a private message, they don't count.
3338829	3341670	Or you can send them to email.
3341810	3351272	You can send them over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And I have to ask Jamie now, do we want the terror mix of Schlagwerk or do we want the original?
3351292	3351992	Let's go for the terror mix.
3352012	3353292	We want the terror mix, so I need to find it.
3353312	3355133	So we're going to have a new fuck you song for...
3356614	3358435	It's always going to still be Schlagwerk.
3358475	3359556	It will always be Schlagwerk.
3359596	3361457	I will never not use Attack Song.
3362998	3364719	Yes, you'll get Jenny Rom, JB, I promise.
3364839	3365539	Alright, here we go.
3366239	3367960	It's time for the Fuck Use of the Week.
3371542	3374544	Okay, let's... This is fucked up.
3374604	3374864	Okay.
3379189	3383750	The first fuck you of the week goes to Walgreens for not having chocolate cupcakes.
3384590	3387391	Everybody here knows that chocolate cupcakes are my crack food.
3387691	3388451	Well, they didn't have them.
3388691	3391012	They had chocolate zingers, which I think are becoming my new crack food.
3391112	3396913	Anyway, so I'm not as sufficiently wired as I could be, although I almost finished a bottle of Propel.
3397133	3400114	Which fuck you to Mr. Spanky for making me nearly choke on my Propel.
3400634	3400954	Okay?
3402534	3403975	Um, let's see.
3406226	3407127	I think he likes choking.
3407427	3409768	Yeah, Mr. Spanky, from what I hear, enjoys choking.
3410889	3418593	Another fuck you goes toward the shitty week I had, because I just felt shitty and PMS-y, and that sucked.
3419393	3420594	Actually, you know, that was bad.
3422234	3424856	My other fuck you is a very, very serious fuck you.
3426334	3427795	It goes toward drama queens.
3428675	3430435	Not all drama queens are bad, mind you.
3430996	3436777	But then there's the people who complain about their life and then don't do shit to change it.
3437637	3439978	If you hate your life, do something about it.
3440898	3444719	If you want change to happen, go make it fucking happen.
3445140	3450241	You know, it may not be instant, but you don't have a right to bitch unless you start doing something about it.
3450521	3450901	Okay?
3451882	3453162	That's what I want to say about that.
3454989	3460752	and on a happier note, um, do you need to be happy bunny plushies and fuck them for not making me?
3461333	3462713	I did see a happy bunny doll once.
3463454	3463834	Somewhere.
3463934	3464314	I don't remember.
3464354	3465375	It was on a topic, I think.
3465495	3467656	Oh, and a happy bunny plushie?
3467916	3469137	Oh, we'll find you one for Christmas.
3470858	3471198	Alright.
3471458	3472039	Oh, one more thing.
3472799	3474120	Johnny the Homicidal Maniac is cool.
3474700	3475360	Okay, thank you.
3475400	3477942	I'm not getting many fuck yous of the week in the chat room.
3477962	3478942	This is kind of surprising.
3478982	3480283	I've seen one pop up so far.
3480363	3481203	Usually there's like 20.
3481303	3485285	So, just another reminder, send them all on your way.
3485405	3487146	Unless you're sending them over email, that's fine too.
3487206	3491308	OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com They need happy noodle boy plushies.
3492469	3495050	Moving along, Loki, your fuck yous of the week, please.
3495939	3496440	Oh boy.
3497961	3502405	Okay, let's begin with that hellhole that we call Sunsplash.
3502946	3504647	Or Arvigil for all those.
3504988	3505768	Let me do this time.
3506649	3509632	Okay, well I went there two days this week, that was probably mistake number one.
3510233	3513816	First thing I go there, there's some dumbass behind the counter, I want, you know, soda.
3514397	3517740	You stand there, kind of, you know, dead to the world.
3518380	3520162	So I see the bell, and I press spell.
3520222	3522124	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3522204	3523385	I do that for about two minutes.
3523846	3527229	And it finally goes, oh, oh, oh, and just sees me there.
3527690	3529772	So then I'm like, okay, can I get a large surge?
3530373	3531534	Uh, we don't have surge no more.
3531614	3534477	So fuck them for not having surge, and fuck that stupid idiot.
3534797	3536419	Fuck them for hiring dumbass people.
3536719	3539102	Why the hell do they have dumbass kids working at this stupid place?
3539822	3540183	I swear.
3540783	3547750	and fuck them today for not fucking refilling the machine fast enough with tickets because I keep kicking ass at stupid Speed Demon.
3548391	3554917	So fuck them for that and just fuck them for not keeping the machines up because they suck ass.
3555337	3556559	So I hate them, that's fine.
3557499	3564166	Now the next thing I have an FU for is SQS, also known as Stupid Question Syndrome.
3565026	3568329	These stupid people out there that ask you really dumb, obvious questions.
3568409	3572833	For instance, when I'm playing the machine, I have a giant stash of tickets in there.
3573093	3575456	Did you win those from that machine there?
3577417	3578438	Yeah.
3579019	3580460	That's why they're coming at the machine?
3580760	3583823	That's why there's a big pile attached to the machine on the floor.
3584404	3585425	I won them for the machine.
3585645	3586626	How did you know that?
3588619	3590341	I won them, you fucking idiot!
3591041	3592963	Also, for people that drive below the speed limit.
3592983	3594964	The speed limit's posted there, so you drive faster than it.
3595185	3598447	It's a goal, you know, you wanna achieve better than the speed limit.
3598948	3605753	But these people are just like, oh, the speed limit, they stay away from it like it's like a fucking, uh, leper or something like that, you know?
3605933	3609877	Just like, stay away from that piece of shit, and they drive like 20 under the speed limit.
3609897	3612099	I'm like, trying to swerve around them and shit.
3613544	3614065	I hate them.
3614305	3615246	I hate slow people.
3615566	3616687	I hate slow people mentally.
3616827	3618629	I hate slow people in automobiles.
3619449	3620790	May they all die.
3621431	3625935	Fucking A. I swear, they should give me, you know, fucking license to kill.
3626295	3627897	I would save the world.
3628737	3632301	Just eliminate the fucking weakness of our damn society.
3633174	3634315	KILL THE STUPID PEOPLE!
3634835	3635816	KILL THEM ALL!
3636597	3640319	Yeah, but without stupid people, what would give us smart people any kind of meaning?
3640860	3641760	There has to be a balance.
3642681	3644122	We'll just lock them up in little pens.
3644162	3650186	Yeah, but right now it's like 9 to 10, or 9 to 1, or something like that, you know?
3650547	3653129	You have 9 stupid people, and you have 1 smart person.
3653149	3654710	9 stupid people, 1 smart person.
3655090	3656991	I say we just, like, drop it down to 3 to 1?
3657091	3659293	I don't know, something like that?
3661196	3662917	Yeah, so they all suck.
3663117	3663437	I hate them.
3663457	3665698	Stupid people are meant to be peons of the smart.
3665718	3668000	We order them around and they fight our war for us.
3668020	3672982	Yeah, but then they're stupid and they get in our way and they annoy me and they ask me stupid questions and just... I hate them.
3673202	3673963	I hate them all.
3674443	3674803	Die.
3675423	3676644	Fucking die.
3677504	3678605	You want all their balls to die.
3679426	3679666	Yes.
3682387	3685127	Um, that, yeah, that's pretty much it.
3685287	3687968	Uh, FB to Fortune Cookie to tell me to kill my relatives.
3688888	3690789	Because, uh, I don't like that.
3691089	3692389	It's not cool.
3693589	3695610	And, uh, yeah, Fortune Cookies kind of suck.
3695630	3696890	What kind of fortunes are these?
3696990	3700571	It says, you'll inherit a large sum of money from your relatives.
3702398	3703779	Thank you for watching.
3703799	3704500	See you next time.
3720316	3728019	I forget what the fucking thing said, but it basically called me ugly or stupid, so the fuck that stupid fortune cookie?
3728099	3730459	See, it said I'm stupid!
3730920	3731860	Said I'm stupid!
3732160	3733280	May they die!
3733921	3734881	Anyways, that's it.
3736541	3738202	You're stupid, it said you didn't have any common sense.
3739418	3741120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3759517	3782324	and we started playing Oni Mode and keep in mind I haven't played DDR in about three weeks, by the way and I'm like, oh, I'll play Oni Mode with Brad and I said, Brad, I'm willing to do any Oni in the game except Love Revenge because I always fail Japan like in five seconds because I can't ever get those gallops shut up, stop laughing at me, fuck you so, of course, what does Brad decide to pick?
3782444	3788226	he picks the Oni, Naoki featuring Politary I'm going to double this fuck you I had to listen to this
3789966	3790906	So fuck Brad.
3791466	3792007	I hate you.
3792067	3792787	I'm just kidding.
3793087	3793927	I love you, Brad.
3794167	3794707	But not too much.
3794727	3795467	Irene's watching.
3799828	3804329	I'd also like to say F you to being tired because I was really tired at the club last night.
3804349	3807530	And that's just not cool to go to a club and feel like you're dancing like a zombie.
3807570	3809991	Unless you're at a golf club, then, you know, that's what you're supposed to be doing.
3812449	3814930	I like to say F you to not doing a damn thing this week, really.
3814970	3817052	I just kind of sat at home and just relaxed all week.
3817332	3822134	Oh, F you to sleeping like 12 hours, because that's what I did last night.
3822895	3827698	I went to bed at 4.30 in the morning and I woke up at 4-ish, 4.30 this afternoon.
3828158	3830339	So F you to sleeping 12 hours, because what a waste of time.
3830359	3832660	You can't say F you to me, because I'm too nice for you.
3833661	3835242	I got you your song in Animal Crossing.
3835402	3837183	That's true, you did get my song in Animal Crossing.
3837583	3841024	FU for Rob not being here when I got here and had to wait half an hour in the cold.
3841244	3849146	Oh yes, FU to me sleeping in so long that it took me a while to go get Jamie and Loki had to wait out here in the cold in front of my house for a half hour.
3849306	3850726	But I saw Harry Potter today.
3850766	3853927	FU to Loki because he brought Mongolian barbecue and steak up my whole house, asshole.
3854387	3855568	I saw Harry Potter today.
3856088	3856468	My day was good.
3856488	3856908	Not an FU.
3857728	3858589	No, my day was good.
3858649	3859089	Ha ha.
3859209	3860149	So that's all your bad days.
3861876	3862717	All right.
3863357	3866299	Let's go around the room and listen to some other Fuck You's of the Week.
3866640	3869182	JB, do you have any Fuck You's of the Week?
3869202	3869562	Yes, I do.
3886568	3887029	That's it?
3888149	3888749	Alright, that's it.
3888870	3891831	Hand that microphone on over to Bradley, see if he has anything he wants to say.
3894032	3895533	Um, not too much, I think.
3895913	3897714	Maybe they fuck me for being so lazy all the time.
3898055	3900576	I need to find a job, I just sit around at home all day doing nothing.
3901648	3903949	City and IRC, talking to people.
3904029	3905570	But at least you're not on unemployment.
3906191	3907131	No, I'm not on unemployment.
3907151	3909172	So at least you're not, you're leeching from the system.
3909212	3910613	I'm not bagging on the system.
3910773	3912154	You're okay.
3912374	3916876	Oh, and maybe adding to Loki's fuck you to the people on the road.
3917056	3920218	Fuck people who gawk all the time and slow everyone down for miles.
3920338	3925581	People like to see people just stop on the side of the road because they have many other problems than people else.
3926181	3926561	Oh, look!
3926581	3927542	There's someone on the side of the road!
3927562	3928123	There's stuff!
3928443	3929824	I was like, look!
3929884	3932046	And stare and slow down and slow everyone else down!
3933303	3941466	I don't want to talk to him, so I ignore him, I walk around, I don't talk to him, I don't make eye contact with him, I wish he would just die, and stop talking to me!
3941526	3943567	Stop trying to talk to me!
3958251	3961593	and FU to the kid who likes to grab... JB, chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.
3961974	3963134	Chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.
3963154	3967898	FU to the kid that grabs asses in a football tournament.
3967918	3969799	You sure that's not Mr. Spanky's son?
3971320	3972161	What's he wearing, leather?
3972961	3975203	Uh... Oh, ass!
3978485	3981287	Alright, let's go on to the chat room and email FU, shall we?
3984815	3986476	Good God, Twin, you got too many FUs.
3986536	3987377	I'm reading some of these.
3988418	3993882	A lot of FUs to Justin for being Jenny Rom's bitch and not his and not sending him Jenny Rom songs.
3995123	3998225	FU to people at the arcade literally hanging on the PVP machine.
3998645	3999946	FU to still having dial-up.
4000146	4001827	FU to Jenny Rom songs being hard to find.
4003129	4005732	F you to Mr. Spanky, finally someone with his opinions.
4006113	4009557	And F you to no one using the new V-host he set up for the chatroom.
4012241	4015605	F you to... Oh no, that's not an F you.
4016787	4017828	That's an happy F you.
4017888	4020212	I don't read happy things on this show, so F you, Twen.
4022324	4025246	Skyline says, F you to Germs for making him sick.
4026587	4027187	That does suck.
4027247	4027888	I hate being sick.
4027928	4028929	I was sick a couple weeks ago.
4029809	4031290	Oh, Black Lab has a few F yous.
4031370	4032311	I better restart the song.
4032331	4033011	This is going to be long.
4033552	4034933	Fuck that Mr. Spanky thing.
4034973	4036173	I've been internally soiled.
4036234	4036754	I hate you.
4037354	4038595	Mr. Spanky, thank you.
4038615	4039055	Welcome.
4040657	4046240	Fuck the UCD library for only having one copy of every book, so some of the books I needed weren't in stock.
4046801	4051444	Fuck the drama that my suitemates are getting into with other people, and fuck the MGL... Oh, that's not very nice.
4054989	4060259	Well, okay, he says fuck himself because he has two finals and can't go to the MGL tournament on Friday the 13th.
4060800	4061140	I guess.
4064106	4065508	Some of us have jobs in K-Road.
4066690	4072393	But we realize that the people organizing the tournament probably couldn't get any other day, so life just sucks sometimes.
4073154	4075535	Yes, I won't be able to go to that either, and I want to, I really do.
4075555	4076235	We send our love.
4076615	4078396	Yes, we send our love and blowjobs.
4079457	4086121	DarkTetStudio says, F you for still having the same Vanessa May song for the longest time now.
4086821	4087722	Now we need to work on that.
4087742	4088982	We're never getting rid of Destiny.
4089002	4091564	We'll never get rid of Destiny, but we might add something else in there too.
4091604	4093044	I know we won't red hot in there and...
4094506	4097268	I want Devil's Chill in there, but I think that's a little too fast for me.
4097468	4097989	We shall see.
4099891	4103214	And F you to the bastard who keeps outbidding me on my Japanese PlayStation 2.
4103654	4104495	It's my bitch!
4104836	4105516	Back down!
4105696	4106517	Or go down!
4107178	4110621	That's it.
4110781	4111122	Alright.
4111943	4112883	Oh, you have another one, Jamie.
4112903	4113144	Yes.
4113664	4115726	Thank you to my Parapara controller for not working.
4115766	4116087	Thank you.
4118939	4121020	Vidpower says, F you to viruses.
4121100	4123622	I had a cold all week and I started running a small fever.
4124022	4125283	I also have a sore throat from it.
4125403	4131968	Also, F you to the sun for having glare on the Beatmania 2DX machine and making the screen even harder to see.
4132608	4135110	At least you have a Beatmania 2DX machine in town.
4135410	4135690	F you.
4138192	4140974	Slinky says, F you to the Metreon pads for sticking.
4143795	4144616	What do you expect?
4148584	4149825	Why are you playing at the Metreon?
4149845	4150966	It's like two bucks a game.
4151146	4154810	Fuck the Metreon for charging that much for a piece of shit EDR USA.
4155831	4157412	Actually, they have Max 2s upstairs now.
4158433	4159113	Who cares?
4160755	4165559	Just wanted to point that out.
4167461	4167961	Let's see.
4168462	4170023	Oh, he went to the auto show today.
4171845	4172866	Oh, Loki says that's okay.
4174707	4178509	Brack2000 says, F you to Lost Ketchup for existing.
4179169	4179569	Yes!
4179750	4182311	If you don't know, they're the ladies that sing the Ketchup song.
4182591	4184772	They basically stole that song from the Sugarhill Gang, by the way.
4186773	4188394	It's a sample of Rapper's Delight.
4191679	4194822	F you to the closest DDR machine being 40 miles away.
4195242	4196083	Crap, that does suck.
4196163	4196843	I'm sorry.
4198284	4199705	I have had a cry for you just now.
4199725	4200646	Yeah, cry.
4201146	4205370	I drove out to Roosevelt Beltland 40 miles every week to play DDR.
4205750	4206671	So screw you, I don't care.
4206991	4209413	But if you wanted to, you could go to Tapioca Express.
4209733	4211494	Not when it first came out here.
4211754	4212715	That's right.
4212735	4213836	That's the USA day.
4214957	4215257	Alright.
4216358	4217259	I first started playing this.
4219609	4224730	23rd Magus says, F you to Afronova Primeval, which he passed with 1 tenth of a bar left.
4224850	4226891	Also, F you to Nori Nori Nori for obvious reasons.
4226951	4229611	Oh, that happens to be the song I'm playing right now.
4230352	4232952	It was me and Wanda the first time I passed it.
4235913	4243235	I had like half my... Actually, I had... You know how on Fifth Mix they have the little tiny bars that equal the whole bar?
4243735	4245035	I had half of one of those left.
4245055	4248196	That sucks.
4250511	4251431	Yeah, fuck Wanda.
4252691	4253752	I guess that's it.
4253792	4260255	Oh, we need to check now, because I know we have at least one email sitting in there, so I will go to the mail.
4262776	4264056	La la la, going to the mailbag.
4264096	4265497	Oh, I need mailbag music.
4266097	4266857	Let's open up the mailbag.
4266877	4270359	We'll have to play one Jenny Rom song just because it fits.
4271479	4273400	Oh, we're going to play Email Me.
4273720	4276501	Email Me is not Jenny Rom, that's Paul and Terry.
4276521	4277362	You meant Blonde Girl.
4278700	4280121	You want Blonde Girl or you want Email Me?
4280181	4280742	Email Me.
4281743	4283144	You're going to break your own ban?
4284325	4285446	It's not on the normal playlist.
4285787	4286087	All right.
4286307	4289090	Actually, it used to be, but I took it out because you banned Paul Eteri, remember?
4289290	4291052	Go ahead and play it because I actually kind of want to hear it.
4291112	4291432	All right.
4293374	4295996	I'm not the only one coming out of the closet tonight on the show, apparently.
4296056	4297498	Okay, okay.
4297518	4298138	Here.
4298158	4299480	Give me this.
4300300	4300641	Hi.
4300881	4302543	I just turned it off because I can't hear.
4303023	4303784	Because this is me...
4312065	4312625	Say something!
4312806	4313266	Oh, hi!
4313686	4314466	What are you looking for?
4314486	4315406	Are you looking for a new song?
4315426	4318007	Yes.
4318067	4319088	This is our email music?
4319628	4319868	Okay.
4320228	4321188	Here's our new email music.
4324329	4324770	Alright.
4331152	4332652	And Rob is typing in stuff.
4333573	4335193	Oh wait, I forgot we changed the password to the box.
4335233	4336494	I forgot about this.
4338442	4339943	It's the same one as the LiveJournal password.
4340003	4341963	Oh yes, tell everybody about the LiveJournal community.
4341983	4344404	We have a LiveJournal community.
4345845	4347725	It's called Orange Lounge.
4347745	4356188	If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge, you get to look at our crap every day.
4356948	4358009	And it's interesting crap.
4358169	4358769	It doesn't stink.
4361232	4361612	All right.
4363013	4364774	F you to Yahoo for sending me spam.
4364814	4366275	We have spam in our mailbox right now.
4366615	4371017	And it looks like I wrote a note to myself in there, too, which I already took care of, so I can delete those.
4372578	4375559	So let's open up this email from Dave, who isn't here tonight.
4375699	4377800	And he sent us an email saying, I'm not there.
4378521	4380002	He says, read this word for word.
4380042	4380462	We'll see.
4381869	4387574	Well, sorry I couldn't be there this week, so a big F you to both my parents for taking me to Big Sur, which blows ass.
4387654	4388435	What is Big Sur?
4388475	4389195	Waterbed store.
4389816	4390116	Okay.
4392018	4392638	It's on the coast?
4392658	4393319	What do they do there?
4394140	4394540	I don't know.
4394640	4396161	I think that's where they have, like, surfing companies.
4397122	4397422	Okay.
4397943	4399004	Oh, a surf shop, dude!
4399204	4402707	No, when I lived in Alabama, there's a waterbed store called Big Sur Waterbeds.
4404725	4405886	Wait, Loki, in the mic.
4406347	4408268	Big Sur is a fucking campground.
4408348	4409669	It's in, like, the coast.
4411111	4413413	Alright, it's like a forest or some shit like that.
4413653	4415334	We need to take this show to the wilderness!
4416375	4417676	I've never heard of that place.
4417776	4419498	I always knew of it as being a waterbed store.
4421919	4427843	I was going to drive down past there, but fuck you to the Sacramento traffic, so I had to go to some mountains.
4427943	4428403	That was cool.
4428423	4431746	Because I got to do that before the snow came to the mountains.
4433347	4435848	Bradley, by the way, is the king of impromptu road trips.
4436349	4436729	The king.
4437569	4438090	I'm sorry, JB?
4438150	4441652	The name of that one movie where they have a place where they camp out?
4450506	4452488	George Lounge and the Blair Witch Project, thank you.
4454150	4456212	Fuck, fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck was that?
4456232	4457232	Fuck this, fuck that!
4457252	4462377	That was basically the Blair Witch Project in 10 seconds, thank you.
4462397	4464419	The Mr. Spanky Project!
4464940	4465721	Da-da-dum!
4471362	4471823	Keep reading.
4491135	4491535	Haha.
4492336	4501044	And oh, if you want to join our IRC chat, just go to any other side IRC server and it's Channel Pound Orange Lounge, or it's on most of the same servers as the other big Mamani chat rooms.
4501104	4501624	How cute.
4501824	4507449	I was there last night, and the only person there was Black Lab, so... Oh, well, you were there for a second.
4507469	4508130	You were idling.
4508750	4509531	I was asleep.
4509791	4511913	I was downloading stuff.
4513670	4517652	And also, FYI, you can get to the chat room directly through our website.
4517672	4523075	We have a Java chat for those of you that just don't have the time to set up MIRC or don't want to or you're on a work computer.
4523255	4527117	I don't know why the hell you'd be at work on a Sunday night, but it is Monday morning in some countries.
4527137	4529078	You know we don't have Java on my work computer?
4529098	4530259	Well, that kind of sucks.
4530279	4531980	Don't let us run the... I can't run it.
4532981	4540745	Anyway, you can do that directly through our website, orangelounge.skiu.tx F you to Jamie for eating my taquitos a while ago.
4541559	4543300	Dude, you left him here, butthole.
4544261	4545102	Okay, that's about it.
4545142	4545802	Maybe more later.
4547423	4549585	And that, ladies and gentlemen, was our FUs of the week.
4551026	4551906	Oh wait, I got one more.
4551926	4553448	I got one more, I'm sorry.
4554128	4556550	I have to find a special song for this FU too, I'm sorry.
4557470	4558691	Just give me one minute here.
4562374	4562634	Okay.
4564395	4564876	Here we go.
4564896	4567037	Sorry, we'll take a break right after this FU.
4573434	4576076	FU to Internet Drama from DCB.
4576537	4577838	Thank you.
4577858	4582162	I don't know if you can hear, but we're playing Wesley Willis for you in the background.
4583483	4588587	Alright, because Jamie has to pee, we're going to take a quick break and we will be right back.
4589128	4594773	And when we come back, the Bamani Cage Match, a brand new game we're going to play here.
4595553	4596134	on the show.
4596294	4606584	Your votes will determine what the next song to go into Orange Lounge playlist rotation during the Bomani Music & More program, which plays when we're not on this station, will be.
4607605	4612330	And, uh, yeah, so in the meantime, enjoy some Guitar Freaks music.
4613631	4613912	Yay.
4628708	4631329	Thank you for watching!
4654337	4656883	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranmelan
4688257	4689158	Thank you for watching!
4932358	4933382	Thank you for watching
5072774	5074476	Thank you for watching!
5124130	5124693	Here we go!
5234652	5255438	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball Hello Alright, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Episode number 21
5258958	5264060	And now, as promised, we are going to start the Big Fat Bomani Cage Match.
5264780	5266160	I need some good cage match music.
5266200	5269041	What's a good... What's a good cage match song?
5270942	5272102	Something 2DX-ish.
5272402	5273843	I'm thinking something kind of...
5276665	5278205	Ooh, I don't know if I have We Will Rock You.
5278465	5278926	I might.
5279926	5282566	I think I have one of the other Queen covers in another directory.
5283786	5285927	How about, like, uh... Radical Fate?
5286967	5288147	Okay, alright, that'll work.
5288427	5288787	That'll work.
5289468	5291128	Oh, Shlag works for another segment, don't you think?
5292208	5293348	And then, uh, Electro-Tuned.
5293849	5294529	Electro-Tuned.
5295829	5297069	Do I have Electro-Tuned?
5297089	5297569	I thought I did.
5298029	5298429	Do you?
5298509	5300290	If you've got... I've got them all.
5300310	5300770	Hold on.
5301210	5303470	I've got everything, it's just in a different directory.
5305671	5306111	I think...
5307351	5310974	How about Holic?
5310994	5311775	Holic's a good song.
5311795	5312616	What's Holic?
5313216	5313777	Holic will work.
5313857	5316299	Okay.
5316619	5316799	What?
5317039	5317520	What, JB?
5317560	5317780	What?
5317940	5318541	Get out!
5318681	5319902	You are banned from the show.
5322204	5325426	JB just admitted that he does not like tag.
5325446	5326207	Oh, he likes QQQ.
5326467	5328369	I threw the Clifford ball at him.
5334556	5340313	The Clifford Ball of Justice has been tossed to JB Without further ado The Bomani Cage Match
5341713	5349617	Now, since the first time we've done the Bomani Cage match, what this is going to be all about is we're going to play you two songs, and they aren't from any Bomani game.
5349837	5351037	Let's play that out in front.
5351338	5368726	They are not from any Bomani game, but they have something to do with either a Bomani artist, a Bomani, some kind of Bomani relation, like another cover of a Bomani song, another Dance Maniacs dance track, or it's just kind of video game related.
5369246	5370046	Yeah, the winner wins
5398246	5404191	The winner is then challenged next week by a new song, and if a new song beats the winner out, then it plays for the week.
5404271	5406693	Otherwise, the winner will stay on and play for the next week.
5408112	5414613	Maybe what we'll do is we'll do next week it'll be three and we'll bring back the one from last week as well.
5415033	5415473	We'll do that.
5415653	5416214	I like that idea.
5416554	5419974	Okay, so this week it's only going to be two folks.
5420294	5422035	It's only going to be two songs that we're going to play.
5422055	5424435	Now, are we going to actually play the entire songs or do you just want to play clips?
5424675	5425735	I think we ought to play the whole song.
5425875	5428816	No, play clips of each and then whichever one wins plays the whole thing.
5429956	5430956	I think we ought to play the whole song.
5430996	5432057	That's how... What?
5434117	5434297	What?
5436161	5437262	Really different all the way through.
5437282	5438222	Well, what do you guys think?
5438242	5438583	I don't know.
5439083	5439503	Full song?
5447938	5449939	Well, okay, we'll do the whole thing.
5450560	5455082	So what we're going to do, though, is we're not going to go into that right just yet.
5455363	5459045	We'll go to another topic on the program and kind of do that as our next break.
5459885	5460406	You want to do it now?
5461146	5461846	All right, we'll do it now.
5462267	5466429	Okay, so the two songs we're going to match up tonight in the Big Mamadi Cage match.
5467130	5468290	Oop, not Viv Ribbon, my bad.
5469511	5470432	Maybe that'll be next week, though.
5472273	5474094	Okay, the two songs are...
5475919	5478781	The Zippers with All Around the World, The Bubble Mix.
5478901	5481263	And for those that don't know who the Zippers are, well, JB, you're the expert.
5481283	5484506	Why don't you tell everybody who the Zippers are and what they've done in DDR?
5485807	5490130	The Zippers were Jenny Rom versus Zippers, and they did Waka Waka.
5490931	5496235	And you can't really tell the difference between them because they both sound exactly the same.
5496255	5496636	Let's see.
5499545	5506892	Okay, and the second song that we're going to have playing is going to be, it's actually an overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy, or FF Music DJ.
5507493	5511777	It's Final Fantasy 7, String Machine, the Choral Prison mix.
5514319	5517422	Choral, or Chorel, whatever.
5519261	5547378	So first we're going to play, and then you'll also get to get our opinions Since we have to participate in this somehow, we're not getting to vote in this You're going to get our big fat opinions on this We're going to be like the American Idol judges on these songs So if they suck, we're going to let you know So we're putting on our judging faces right now So, and then once we've given you our opinions on the songs, you'll be able to vote Now here's the thing, don't vote until they've both been played or your vote doesn't count I'm not counting any votes that come in until the second song has finished completely
5549399	5550980	Yes, they're saying they can't hear you on the air, JB.
5551760	5552921	You want to scream something at the camera?
5554082	5554222	Ah!
5555602	5555963	Brilliant.
5556443	5557483	Alright, so here we go.
5557603	5561705	Starting off the Bomani Cage match, this is the Zippers with All Around the World.
5561725	5561705	1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3
5592698	5605003	We wanna get some fun all around the world Let's sing some in this magical land You know Hey boy, come on This is a silly song for you Oh yeah We're gonna get some fun all around the world We wanna be
5777435	5779683	I sing this song, song, song for you
5823328	5824809	This song makes me want to kill people.
5825249	5828772	All right, the Bomani Cage Match in progress right now.
5828872	5831594	That was All Around the World by The Zippers.
5832154	5837258	Your thoughts, some things from the chatroom.
5837618	5848066	We're getting, this song is the shit, this song reminds me of CatDog, and I can't tell because there's a whole other cage match going on in the chatroom, so I can't really tell what they're saying about the song.
5848086	5849767	That song may be the shit, but it's time to flush.
5851068	5851909	Oh, Jamie, ouch.
5852149	5852790	So you didn't like it.
5853010	5854091	On a scale of 1 to 10, Jamie.
5855092	5856013	I'd give it a fart.
5858536	5866584	I'd have to say that, you know, I really hated the song Around the World by ATC, but I like that song now.
5866604	5868165	So you like that song or you like this song?
5868205	5873410	I'm just not digging the whole Disneyland happy vibe going on here.
5877029	5877829	All right, JB.
5877849	5879490	I like it because it's Sci-Fam.
5880110	5881350	You like it because it's Sci-Fam.
5881930	5882471	All right, fair enough.
5882491	5883811	Bradley, your thoughts on that song?
5884631	5889452	It was okay, but it kept going on and on, the same beat over and over.
5889472	5893093	I was like, uh-oh, turn it off, turn it off.
5894074	5896394	It's going to pound into my brain until it explodes.
5896774	5898195	Four hours a day.
5900575	5902176	So when you were about to go postal?
5902216	5902416	Yes.
5904872	5907674	I agree, my thoughts are it was very happy, happy, happy, happy.
5907714	5909395	It was kind of like nauseatingly happy.
5909875	5912778	The beginning was bad, but I could deal with it.
5913058	5914099	It's not that bad.
5914159	5918722	It's a nice change of pace from, you know, meanness.
5919082	5920003	In what dictionary?
5920723	5922665	Are you going to notthedictionary.com?
5924106	5925967	No, that's what makes me want to go out and kill people.
5926868	5927969	And sing while I'm doing it.
5928389	5929230	Alright, so...
5930307	5931648	It makes me happy, noodle boy happy.
5931728	5933829	Alright, going around the room, quick, scale of 1 to 10.
5934289	5937971	What do you think?
5938031	5938151	Uh, 1.5.
5938491	5938151	1.5.
5938651	5939051	Bradley?
5939671	5940071	Probably about a 4.
5940552	5941092	Probably about a 4.
5941132	5941472	JB?
5942373	5941472	10.
5942393	5944734	10.
5943453	5944734	Uh, I will give it a 6.
5945434	5945994	I'll give it a 6.
5946354	5948595	Alright, so that was... I'm twitching.
5948695	5949796	Zippers all around the world.
5949836	5951397	Here's the second song in the cage match.
5951457	5953738	This is by Final Fantasy Music DJ.
5953778	5954838	It's an overclocked remix.
5954858	5958420	This is the Final Fantasy 7 String Machine here on the Bomani Cage Match.
5962336	5962937	Thanks for watching!
6003627	6004609	Thanks for watching!
6092481	6094643	Thank you for watching!
6218295	6218915	That was fucking cool!
6247501	6249284	It's the Bomani Cage match going on right now.
6249444	6255952	You can start sending in your votes right now via the chat room or our email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
6256573	6265004	And it is, once again, the Zippers with All Around the World was the first song we played, and that song was Final Fantasy Music DJ, an overclocked remix of Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
6267529	6270511	So, let's talk about what we thought of the Final Fantasy String Machine.
6270551	6271211	Jamie, your thoughts?
6271292	6271592	Wee!
6271812	6272192	I love it.
6272432	6273093	Wee, you love it.
6273893	6274253	Loki?
6274574	6275234	I, of course, love it.
6275314	6278416	It's one of the best Final Fantasy music remixes I've ever heard.
6279437	6280197	Which song was it?
6280237	6281578	I couldn't recognize what song it was.
6281598	6286101	Yeah, I guess it's supposed, it's, yeah, Choral Prison from Final Fantasy VII.
6286261	6288563	I honestly didn't recognize the original song either.
6288623	6289303	To me, that's obscure.
6289383	6291565	It's the place that was in the desert under the Gold Cross Ark.
6292285	6293267	Oh, okay.
6293988	6295470	I need to play Final Fantasy VII again sometime.
6295650	6296631	That's what that song makes me think.
6296892	6297813	Bradley, your thoughts on the song?
6298273	6298754	It's pretty cool.
6299034	6299455	Pretty cool?
6299735	6300056	I liked it.
6300376	6301017	Alright, you liked it.
6301057	6301758	JB, your thoughts?
6302719	6304582	X. He's making a big X with his fingers.
6305183	6308227	But of course, he's a Jenny Rom horse, so of course he's sticking with the zippers.
6308547	6309488	It's not happy enough for him.
6310149	6310830	Thanks for watching!
6326713	6328314	I think that's very cool.
6328954	6331655	Although, it's a little bit kind of repetitive for my taste.
6331695	6332056	I don't know.
6332196	6333556	I found it to be a little bit repetitive.
6333636	6335477	So, that's my only issue with it.
6335557	6336658	So, scale of 1 to 10.
6337258	6338939	Jamie, what do you think?
6338959	6338939	9.
6339759	6340559	9.
6340259	6340559	Loki?
6341080	6340559	10.
6341680	6342400	10.
6342020	6342400	Bradley?
6342420	6342400	8.
6343661	6344061	JB?
6345362	6344061	4.
6346402	6346962	I'm going to give it a 7.
6348323	6354488	So, it sounds like that song would win if we were the people voting, but we're not, because this is everybody's show.
6354528	6356630	It's not just our show, it's the chatroom show, email show.
6357110	6367298	So send in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com If you want the zippers to win, or you want the Final Fantasy VII string machine to win.
6368179	6369400	That's it, that's my arcade match.
6369420	6371661	We'll have the results for you after the next break.
6371681	6373603	This is your subliminal message, but for Final Fantasy.
6373683	6377266	In the meantime... The spirit commands it.
6378277	6379097	Big news this week, Big Bomani Holiday.
6404508	6408770	19 November and 20 November were both this week, and we had some very big things happen.
6408790	6411211	Jamie, tell us about one thing you wanted to talk about.
6411231	6413212	I feel 20 November and its honor on 2DX.
6413592	6414032	On 2DX?
6414192	6414532	Oh, yes.
6414812	6422616	I'd like to just, I guess, consider, or just basically say 19 and 20 November would pretty much be the Bomani New Year's.
6423316	6430699	That's pretty much what it is, since 20 November was pretty much the start of the whole Bomani line with Beatmania, so I would consider it the New Year's.
6431462	6435626	I don't know if I consider it New Year's, it's not a big party, it's just kind of like a day of remembrance.
6436427	6439310	Well, okay, hey, hey, hey.
6439630	6442333	It's just like Chinese New Year's, I mean, no one celebrates that.
6443374	6444835	Well, the Chinese do, I think.
6444915	6446557	Oh, yeah, like they count, okay.
6446897	6449900	Oh, they're only like, you know, I think a quarter of the world's population.
6449940	6450841	Who cares?
6451482	6453684	That's pretty much what it is, it's an uncelebrated holiday.
6453704	6454345	It's like, um...
6455786	6456286	Arbor Day.
6457107	6458887	Okay, so it's the Bomani Arbor Day.
6460688	6461828	Plant a Bomani machine.
6464810	6466670	So what were some big events that happened in the community?
6467010	6467771	I know you know of one.
6468051	6469211	Jamie, you want to talk about this earlier?
6469291	6472353	I got online and they were like, the show wasn't there.
6472413	6473273	It was like robbed.
6473951	6478213	Oh yeah, Orange Lounge Radio did a celebration very late on 19 November around 11.30.
6478533	6480253	We kind of had a countdown until 20 November.
6481034	6482674	And we had video game guessing.
6482894	6488416	Yes, and then 20 November was celebrated guessing old school 8-bit video game tunes.
6488436	6491697	Which is why you should be listening to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.
6492118	6493158	Yes, have your life like us.
6493178	6496439	Because sometimes you get to hear special live music programs.
6496639	6497440	They happen occasionally.
6497480	6498480	We call them the fuck-offs.
6499025	6503008	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6525623	6528004	I can't use the Nokia ringtones and that makes me cry.
6528064	6530564	But we wanted to play your ringtone, didn't we?
6555371	6559574	Well, my ringtone's not Baymani, but... Well, let's play your ringtone anyway, because we wanted to do this.
6560014	6561455	So I'm going to call you right now, Jamie.
6561575	6562515	No, I can just play it.
6562535	6563236	Oh, you can just play it?
6563376	6564056	Oh, never mind.
6564296	6565917	Don't give me any voicemail, damn it.
6568539	6570200	My ringtone is cooler than everybody.
6580406	6582687	I'm trying to see if anybody in the chat room is going to recognize it.
6585233	6585773	I'll play it again.
6589717	6590957	No, you won't play it again, apparently.
6591438	6592178	I will, too.
6607250	6609732	VidPower says it's Chun-Li's stage.
6610253	6610813	Wrong!
6612374	6614216	Oh, 23rd Magus says that, too.
6615137	6615817	Dude, no.
6616177	6616838	No, not Chun-Li.
6616858	6617778	Stop insulting my girl.
6619198	6621319	For those in the chat room that couldn't guess it, what do you think?
6621399	6621979	What is it, Jamie?
6622479	6623860	It's Sakura's theme song.
6624100	6625180	Sakura's theme song.
6625240	6625561	Wrong girl.
6625581	6626481	No, DarkSakura.
6626701	6627821	Sakura's theme.
6628722	6629762	I hate Chun-Li.
6630662	6630942	Okay?
6631082	6632203	I hate Chun-Li.
6632283	6633743	So close, yet so far.
6633783	6634544	You almost have it.
6634564	6635244	God, I hate her.
6636444	6637585	Okay, here's my ringtone.
6637625	6638805	It's not Bomani-related at all.
6641516	6642316	Why isn't it playing?
6643277	6644177	Because you suck.
6644258	6645558	Oh, because it vibrates on.
6645598	6646159	Whoops, my bad.
6646259	6647459	Yeah, Rob's pocket vibrator.
6648180	6651381	Yes, my cell phone doubles... Every call is a happy call.
6651842	6653423	My cell phone doubles as a vibrator.
6653483	6654263	It's quite exciting.
6657365	6658105	Oh, that doesn't work.
6660587	6661467	What happened?
6661487	6662848	There's my magical ringtones here.
6668291	6670312	No, we can't guess what that is.
6672847	6673687	That's Afronova, right?
6674868	6676528	No, it's a song called The Entertainer.
6676828	6686891	And I'm sure since there's this trend in Bomani to redo a bunch of classical songs into Bomani tunes, I'm sure you'll see that tune up turn up in a Bomani song one day.
6686931	6690292	If you play that song again and you just go... Whoa!
6690732	6691093	Dude!
6691373	6692413	It's a talker remix!
6692793	6695954	Hey, you should put that in your sim.
6696134	6699055	They need to do the bad synthy music and make it a pata pata.
6700771	6701512	That would be wrong.
6701652	6702633	Stop playing with a ferret.
6702693	6703153	Give me that.
6703974	6704234	Okay.
6705075	6709178	So, yes, other 19, 20 November celebrations.
6709659	6715343	In Japan, I believe they released the code to unlock 8th Style's hidden stuff.
6715363	6718426	So now you don't have to... We were thinking... I can play Sakura and fail with Style.
6718446	6723790	Yes, now you can play Sakura without having to triple A, you know, B for U on another heavy whatever.
6724811	6725332	And then Xenon.
6725372	6727333	And two more, yep, two brand new songs also.
6728274	6728795	But no...
6730723	6731604	No more tag.
6731864	6732604	Sorry, Jamie.
6733004	6734265	You have to wait for Night Style.
6734645	6735826	You think there's going to be a Night Style?
6736547	6737387	God, yes.
6737427	6737827	God, yes.
6738948	6739729	You need a ferret.
6740489	6749494	I'm not sure if this happened exactly on 19-20 November, but another website news, 2DX Style kind of got eaten up by BomaniStyle.com, right?
6749695	6751055	Was that earlier, or what happened with that?
6751115	6752156	That was last week.
6752196	6753037	That was last week.
6753097	6753457	My bad.
6754097	6755778	But didn't they kind of celebrate it?
6755858	6759960	Bomani Style redid their site, so that's another one.
6760120	6761701	I guess that's 20 November-ish, I don't know.
6762841	6763622	That was 19 November.
6763662	6766943	Any other websites that redid special things for 19-20 November?
6766983	6768024	I can't think of any.
6768044	6769365	DDR Spot was probably the biggest one.
6769905	6776428	DDR Maniacs deleted my account along with 2,000 other ones, so I guess that's November related, sort of.
6777969	6778649	Happy 20 November!
6781031	6781471	Happy 20 November.
6781491	6782051	Crunch, you're gone.
6782912	6785033	I went to bed, and then I went to work.
6785193	6789054	Yes, how did you privately celebrate 20 November amongst ourselves in the room?
6789294	6791395	What was your own way of celebrating 20 November?
6791615	6795977	Well, first of all, I went to bed, and then I woke up and went to work.
6797177	6802459	And instead of doing my work, I talked on my email with my friend in Maryland.
6803299	6811525	Then I went home and I failed 20 November in 6th style on 7 key because it's a 7 star and I can't pass any yet, although I'm close.
6812646	6819490	And then I put it away and went online and posted it on a bunch of message boards and then played Animal Crossing.
6821151	6822652	And then I played 20 November again.
6824493	6824834	Yeah.
6826215	6828436	And I full comboed some songs, but I forgot what they were.
6828896	6829757	And I passed Fantasy.
6829777	6829917	Fantasy.
6831175	6842644	I passed Fantasy and Light 7 on 4th style Because that was like one of the last two songs I had to do But I fucking hate Get On Beat, thank you Next Loki, how did you celebrate 20 November?
6842664	6854732	I did one more thing I went to bed I played DDR at lunch That's it Alright, yes, Bradley, how did you celebrate 20 November?
6855853	6856734	I didn't really do much of anything
6858727	6859629	Bless for me!
6860149	6861651	J.B., how did you celebrate 20 November?
6863073	6865056	I secretly worshipped Ginny Rom.
6866398	6867860	Gee, how's that different from any other day?
6868339	6869979	That means he had a faptastic time.
6870720	6872520	He had a faptastic 20 November, yes.
6872880	6873601	Thank you, Jamie.
6874941	6876241	How did I celebrate 20 November?
6876722	6884204	I went to work, I came home, I watched 24, I continued my three-week streak of not playing any DDR, jerked off and went to bed.
6885864	6886524	Just kidding.
6886805	6887205	Just kidding.
6887825	6888725	Or at least you'll never know.
6889205	6889745	Yes, Loki?
6890526	6894127	You know, I know this is really the wrong segment to be doing this.
6894147	6894967	That's alright.
6895427	6898048	But I just remembered another FU for the week.
6898726	6901171	And it goes, wait, you don't need to play the music.
6901292	6902634	You don't need to play the music.
6903276	6904458	Oh, fine.
6904578	6906222	Jamie demands I play the music.
6906282	6907665	Therefore, I play the music.
6909481	6915705	F you to the Sakmamani server for fucking crashing constantly all this week.
6916125	6916445	That's it.
6916745	6920167	Oh, also... Yeah, but you can pay for any place to host us.
6921108	6929793	F you to Sakmamani.com as well for not having the space on it to host the Orange Lounge forums as well because that kind of caused the crash.
6930113	6935216	I was kind of trying to set up a little surprise for 20 November for Orange Lounge and that kind of pushed us over quota.
6935376	6935836	My bad.
6936537	6936777	No.
6937317	6948984	And if you were Rob for the... My account got deleted yet again from another glitch that happened to be... If you're the one that posts that causes the quota to get hit, then you get your account deleted.
6949545	6950205	Lucky me!
6950465	6952146	Because I'm always online posting.
6953047	6953427	Whatever.
6953867	6955808	You got a bigger post count out of it, I think, anyway.
6956349	6957609	As if that stuff... Oh, no, you didn't?
6957650	6957930	I don't know.
6957970	6958370	I guessed.
6958970	6959511	Not that it matters.
6959591	6960531	You're still number one!
6961892	6962532	It don't matter!
6963853	6964354	Shit!
6964514	6966515	I'm 500 posts above anyone else.
6967196	6970037	We'll get you to your ho and back, lickety-split.
6970097	6972578	No shit.
6974719	6975760	I've got to play that again.
6975840	6979481	I love it.
6979541	6980982	I had a different portion cookie today.
6981202	6983203	We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.
6983223	6985804	We're going to announce the winner of the Bomani Cage Match.
6985824	6987044	There is still time to vote.
6988165	6995048	Just come to our chat room and vote via private message for the zippers with All Around the World or the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
6995848	6998849	or you can send it over email, orangelaunceradio at yahoo.com.
6999089	7006791	And there's a conversation in the chat room going on right now saying, I worked on a Brilliant to You routine over the weekend to do other people's routines for practice to see how they pull off the moves.
7007152	7008192	It helps with the flow.
7008752	7011513	And that kind of made me think, there's a song I want to play right now.
7011533	7012433	Do they have the Ori no Go flow?
7013534	7015074	Sail away, sail away.
7016394	7019655	No, but I thought of another flow song that I wanted to play for you guys.
7019675	7021416	It facilitates bowel movements, though.
7022276	7025397	So we're going to start this break off with Flotation, the radio mix.
7025417	7026138	This is a different one.
7026158	7028839	This is the one from Vincent D'Amour's greatest hits album.
7028859	7030940	This isn't the same one that's in rotation on Orange Lounge.
7031180	7032601	Stop molesting the ferret!
7032741	7034381	There's two vocal mixes of Flotation.
7034401	7036262	This is the other one that you don't normally hear on Orange Lounge.
7036763	7038143	But you're going to hear it right now, so enjoy.
7038163	7040804	Flotation
7070464	7071693	Reavers in the mind
7154424	7155445	Thank you for watching!
7220684	7221269	Thanks for watching!
7442001	7442868	Thanks for watching!
7484750	7490414	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge been lighting music in more shows?
7490695	7497860	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
7498180	7498300	It's...
7499694	7504119	On Earthly, it's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
7504659	7514089	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 21, and now it's time to reveal the winner of the Big Bomani Cage Match.
7515009	7520014	Tonight in the cage match we had The Zippers with All Around the World.
7520715	7523278	Let me play a little clip of that for you to remind you what this sounds like.
7530051	7531472	How is the Zippers with All Around the World?
7531512	7534893	And the other song we played was the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.
7541575	7554600	All right, those are the two songs that were in the cage match tonight, and I am pleased to announce the winner is, by a pretty close vote, not too far apart, the winner is the Final Fantasy VII String Machine, ladies and gentlemen.
7557521	7557861	All right.
7557881	7558461	People have tape.
7561760	7566761	So the Final Fantasy VII String Machine will be added into the Orange Lounge playlist this week.
7567161	7573202	So check for that during the Bomani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we aren't here.
7574022	7574523	Sorry, JB.
7574583	7575143	Zipper's lost.
7576083	7578763	I want to kill everybody who voted for it.
7579903	7581224	I'll give you all the names after the show.
7581764	7588445	All right, and if you want a copy of that Final Fantasy VII remix, it's an Overclocked remix, so you can find it on Overclocked.org.
7589662	7591624	Or if you want the zippers, you can contact me.
7592204	7593845	So if you want the zippers, just contact JB.
7594025	7594766	Or anything else.
7595987	7596567	Anything?
7596728	7597128	Favors?
7598389	7599149	Like favors?
7600010	7600390	Oh yeah.
7600691	7603213	I think Mr. Spanky has some things he needs done.
7603913	7604554	That's quite a lot.
7606500	7606961	All right.
7607041	7609503	Does Mr. Spanky need to be spanked?
7609603	7610303	Some quick things.
7610564	7617549	Some things that have been coming through the chat room and some various little stories as the two hours have already passed that we've been on the air.
7617609	7620912	Just want to catch up, give everybody a fair chance to have their say on the show.
7621433	7625556	We had an email come in, a late FU come in over email, so I thought I'd read that for you guys.
7625596	7628659	Plus, we had a late one come in in the chat room from somebody who missed the first part of the show.
7628679	7629900	So I'm going to read those for you.
7629940	7630580	So over email...
7631981	7634964	We had an email from... Oh crap, I lost the email.
7635444	7636585	We'll get back to the email in a little bit.
7637426	7638647	Let me read the one from the chatroom.
7640308	7653038	DSCS SoCalKick says, F you to soccer for milking another $81 from his pocket and much more along with the next two Saturdays and my F you... Oh, and F you to his birthday for being next Monday.
7653559	7655400	That's not a bad thing to have a birthday coming up.
7655420	7656421	I thought that was a good thing.
7657731	7658952	You're alive to celebrate it.
7659733	7660193	That's right.
7660213	7661934	You should be glad you're alive to celebrate it.
7662095	7662495	Amen.
7664717	7665297	Oh, I'm sorry, JB.
7665337	7667059	It's in the microphone.
7667599	7672043	My birthday on June 15th, my mom sent me to Hollywood Ball Time for half an hour.
7673063	7674725	And then she said she'd get me a metal pad.
7677107	7679168	Well, F you to JB's mom for not following through on her promise.
7680429	7680670	Alright.
7681931	7683292	We got an F you over email.
7684625	7686306	Moohimer of New Jersey.
7686747	7687387	Moo!
7687748	7688148	Moo.
7688748	7692491	He says, a fuck you goes out to his mom, or, I'm sorry, not to his mom, I'm sorry.
7694053	7696875	A fuck you goes out to his room for being small.
7697075	7701198	That's what happens when I have the mouse over the R-O, I just assume it's another word that ends in O-M.
7701359	7701639	My bad.
7701939	7702159	Sorry.
7702800	7705862	That was a big fuck you going out to his room for being small.
7706183	7706463	Hey, what...
7706923	7708184	Nothing wrong with small rooms.
7708304	7708945	I have a small room.
7709085	7710626	It's all about stacking.
7711226	7713788	Stacking will save you so much space.
7713848	7722795	I've got like 400 DVDs, a whole bunch of movies, a computer, seven game systems, a queen-size bed, and I still have room to move.
7722995	7727718	And this studio that we do this very show in is very small, as JB learned for the first time today.
7727738	7731921	Is that how you go to Walmart and you get those stacky crates and put your stuff in them?
7732081	7738465	No, you go to Kmart, because remember, Kmart is my favorite store, I shot there cause I is poor.
7738706	7740487	Yay Kmart!
7741207	7744549	That was a cheer that they used to do in high school on the bus going to a band.
7746912	7748093	Pretty soon they'll be with Lint.
7777409	7778390	Oh, I have another FU.
7778570	7779711	Mooheimer had two FUs.
7780191	7781072	Please allow me to finish.
7781793	7784255	Also, fuck Swishy Pants, because they're annoying.
7787180	7787901	Swishy Pants!
7788742	7789703	They sound like fun pants.
7790383	7792165	That is so Seinfeld right there.
7793646	7794427	Swishy Pants!
7794647	7795448	What's up with that?
7795868	7803615	No, I remember it was with George, okay, and he had the pants that would rub next to each other, rub together because his legs were so fat.
7803816	7809421	So he'd go, as he was walking, and it was like one of these annoying things that they'd rant on.
7809461	7809841	I don't know.
7809861	7810522	I didn't watch it.
7810922	7812864	I wonder, what about DDR and SwishyPants?
7813425	7820531	That would be... Max 300 and SwishyPants, that would be funny.
7821232	7823034	God, we're getting more FUs a little late.
7823054	7823574	This is it.
7823674	7824235	No more FUs.
7824255	7825436	These are the last ones, alright?
7826617	7828499	FU to Raver's Groove or whatever.
7829360	7834524	DT was one of the poor unfortunate souls that got to hear Raver's Groove play on Orange Lounge about six times in an hour.
7835285	7835846	Let me play.
7837734	7839815	That song happens to be one of my favorites, okay?
7839895	7841415	And it's not my fault that that happened.
7841475	7843076	It's not the song's fault, so get over it.
7845756	7846877	And the Claus Show.
7848197	7848537	Alright.
7851498	7852779	I'd pick that song, dammit.
7853179	7853659	Let's see.
7856020	7857040	F you at late F yous.
7858300	7860381	Yeah, fuck the late F yous.
7860701	7864242	F you to kids on the pad while I'm playing and I'm like, bitch, get off.
7866403	7866683	Bitch!
7870214	7874382	23rd Magus says, this is Nephew, he has a little story he'd like to tell, please.
7874833	7877414	Here's a story of a lovely FU.
7878314	7879634	It's not an FU, it's a different one.
7879654	7881395	He said, this is how we celebrated 20 November.
7881455	7881795	Oh, this is late.
7881815	7882515	We need music, we need music.
7882575	7884316	This is a late 20 November story, I'm sorry.
7884916	7888197	Uh, I don't have 20, I have a teen November, that'll just have to work.
7889697	7892098	I don't have 20 November queued up and I don't feel like pulling up.
7893018	7895119	Uh, late 1920 November celebration story.
7895619	7899740	I went to the roof of the school and yelled out, Be money at the top of my lungs.
7899860	7901060	No, seriously, I did.
7901300	7901500	Yep.
7901900	7903521	And then I took the deer in the headlights looks.
7904541	7904862	Loser!
7904942	7906964	I mean... Hey now, be nice.
7907104	7907845	That was cool.
7908586	7909186	I think that's cool.
7909447	7910768	Especially the deer in the headlights parts.
7911168	7913971	Anything that will get you deer in the headlights looks are awesome.
7914952	7915493	Fabulous.
7915893	7916374	Fabulous.
7916654	7919077	Did he mention he was doing it dressed up like Mr. Spanky?
7921039	7923321	I don't want to see him dressed as Mr. Spanky, I'm sorry.
7924282	7924703	Alright.
7927406	7929087	Those were the late FUs and things of the week.
7929447	7931248	So there you go.
7931308	7934950	You can always send your FUs in a little early if you're not going to be here for the live show.
7935010	7937631	You can always send those over email, orangebronsradio at yahoo.com.
7937651	7938531	That's what Dave did tonight.
7938611	7939172	He got his in.
7939512	7941293	I have an important announcement to make.
7942173	7942393	Yes.
7943414	7947796	I got the hooker to have sex with me in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
7947876	7948996	Thank you very much.
7950837	7952098	Well, isn't that special?
7955925	7958146	Hookers are the work of the devil.
7962827	7963167	Alright.
7964167	7965327	Satan's little play pal.
7965967	7969548	Um, let's see.
7969788	7972329	I'm hoping the other people left, that we're in the house right now.
7972789	7973309	Are they really?
7973889	7974509	Oh, crap.
7976710	7982991	My roommate's girlfriend's parents are here right now, and Loki's just yelled out, I finally got the hooker to have sex with me!
7985103	7988907	You ain't got tact, even if you looked it up in the dictionary.
7996744	7997945	I'm going to get kicked out of my house.
7998105	7999846	Okay, let's move on.
8001427	8002948	Now I'm getting 20 November stories.
8003549	8005190	That's alright, we need something to fill up the show with.
8007211	8008912	SoCalKicks... No more Denny Ross!
8008952	8016357	SoCalKicks... SoCalKicks says... On 20 November, his friend broke his arm.
8017618	8017778	Aww.
8017978	8018718	That sucks.
8019539	8020499	I'm having a cry.
8021260	8022681	Your arm got broken and that's sad.
8024090	8025971	23rd Magus sends us a bit of randomness here.
8026011	8030892	He says, My English essay was titled, I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.
8032433	8033873	Hot, hot, hot.
8036614	8038695	That has nothing to do with 20 November, silly.
8039675	8042356	SoCalKicks wants to point out he broke his arm in soccer.
8042476	8043777	Not like jerking off or anything.
8043817	8046998	Although that would have been a lot more humorous, don't you think?
8047018	8047858	That would have been cool.
8049018	8051079	It would have been seriously...
8052259	8054060	either really clumsy.
8057060	8062882	That was so eight days a week, breaking your neck, trying to perform self-fallatio.
8062902	8065583	That's like clerks.
8065763	8067083	Okay, this one last one.
8067123	8068304	No more 20 November stories.
8068344	8068784	We don't care.
8068804	8070064	I'm just kidding.
8070424	8074806	DCB says he played Beatmania's second mix and got 100% greats on Overdoser.
8075486	8076646	You're special.
8078087	8079427	You are very, very special.
8081258	8081558	All right.
8082479	8083299	No more 20... What?
8084099	8084299	What?
8084539	8085920	This is actually Pomani-related.
8086420	8087281	Oh, dear God, what?
8087661	8093343	And because of 20 November happened to be falling on a Wednesday, there was a new Naoki Journal.
8094003	8094383	Yes.
8094544	8095284	Boo!
8095944	8100166	Yeah, well, they announced the new Naoki Underground song, which, I mean... Now, that's cool.
8100206	8100406	Okay.
8100686	8101327	Thank you for watching!
8115349	8115689	I'm so excited!
8115909	8116269	I'm so excited!
8116289	8117329	I'm so scared!
8142639	8143781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8157986	8158906	Caffeine pills?
8159587	8159787	Oh, yeah.
8186909	8187970	Oh, got it wrong again.
8189011	8190052	I love my job.
8192395	8192655	Alright.
8193436	8194557	Let's go to... Oh, yes.
8194677	8196158	I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling that.
8196298	8196899	We gotta do it again.
8198401	8200222	Yeah, where's the emotion?
8200362	8200923	Do it again.
8201724	8203946	This time we'll take the still photos.
8204006	8204166	No.
8205267	8205528	Once more.
8205548	8206008	Alright.
8206549	8206809	Alright.
8208413	8214798	Let's go to the news, because this is something that really, it doesn't have anything to do with Bomani, but it's kind of funny anyway.
8215239	8221003	And I know a lot of people that play Bomani eat a lot of fast food, and a lot of people also kind of play Bomani as a way to diet.
8221564	8225627	You know, some people play, I admit, when I started playing DDR, I thought it was cool because I was suddenly losing weight.
8225927	8229870	And of course, now that I haven't played DDR in about a month, I'm gaining it all back, but that's beside the point.
8229890	8232572	So I thought I'd read this funny little article and get your guys' thoughts on it.
8233673	8237618	Lawyers claim that Big Mac... Oh, I guess I need some music for this.
8237719	8239381	We need some news music.
8239581	8240322	No, no, DJ Ranma.
8244983	8246865	God, do I even have that in here?
8247445	8251209	Is that in the playlist?
8251269	8255653	I'm going to just play Journey to Wonderland.
8255673	8256554	Toasty burgers!
8256915	8257555	Where is it?
8257615	8259337	Toasty buns, there it is.
8259357	8259657	Alright.
8259677	8260939	This kind of goes with it anyway.
8268243	8272885	Okay, lawyers claim that Big Macs make kids fat.
8276607	8278747	Are Big Macs hazardous to children's health?
8279228	8287191	Lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's on behalf of New York children who have suffered health problems including diabetes and high blood pressure and obesity.
8287651	8294234	In a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, a lawyer alleged that the fast food chain has created a national epidemic of obese children.
8295689	8304753	Samuel Hirsch agreed that the high fat, sugar, and cholesterol content of McDonald's food is a very insipid, toxic kind of thing when ingested regularly by young kids.
8305473	8311496	The plaintiffs include a Bronx teen who ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while living in a homeless shelter.
8312636	8321480	Another is a 13-year-old boy from Staten Island who says he ate McDonald's food three to four times a week and is now 5'4 and 278 pounds.
8322720	8330163	McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman insisted that the lawsuit was a frivolous attempt to cash in on the Golden Arches, the kind of lawsuit that shouldn't be in court.
8330743	8333184	People don't go to sleep and then wake up obese, Lerman said.
8333524	8340065	The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and french fries do to us have been with us for a long, long time.
8340545	8354489	McDonald's has asked Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the case, arguing those who filed the claims cannot show their health woes were caused by Big Macs, and insisting the company has never misled customers about his food.
8355896	8361638	The judge did not immediately rule on the request.
8361778	8364919	All I gotta say is, fucking exercise, lazy bastard.
8365519	8371702	Shit, man, I eat fast food every day of the week, you know, and I'm not like some big tub of lard that's like walking around shit.
8371942	8373522	Get up and do something.
8374162	8377284	Don't just sit there and go, Me eat more burger!
8377764	8378384	Good!
8378544	8380105	You sounded like me for you just then.
8384386	8384806	Oh god.
8387748	8388109	Huh?
8389330	8390010	What?
8394193	8397736	JB's chastising Loki for... Anyway.
8398176	8398336	Yes.
8398696	8400918	So what'd you think about the Big Mac story?
8401498	8405661	First of all, McDonald's is disgusting and I haven't eaten there in easily four years.
8406422	8409284	Except that they had those really tasty bagel sandwiches.
8410452	8426594	DCB and Orange Beanie are in the chat room suggesting that the following should go along with this It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat It is a good place to listen to the music People flock here to get down to the rock music
8429426	8433513	Yes, rock and roll McDonald's, ladies and gentlemen.
8441514	8446118	See, if everybody would just rock and roll a little bit while they're at McDonald's eating Big Macs, maybe they wouldn't get so fat.
8446558	8451162	Well, you know, they put the nutritional information there easily readable.
8452283	8457027	You know, well, I don't know, maybe most of the people who eat there are illiterate, I don't know.
8457308	8461071	You know, those people eating those Big Macs are the same people who think that smoking doesn't hurt anyway.
8461171	8466295	The things that, I don't know, that the government's, you know, not corrupt and...
8468518	8472024	They have no tune with the obvious at all.
8472104	8472906	It's like, huh?
8473226	8474488	Those are unhealthy for me?
8474889	8476552	Don't you think someone would tell me that?
8477541	8480362	This goes back to people being really stupid, okay?
8480882	8490645	People are going to watch TV, and they're going to see this on there, and they'll think, oh, well, that looks dumb, even though they're basically looking at big piles of glycerin that are colored, you know, so they don't melt into light or something.
8491486	8501509	They're looking at this, and they're thinking, oh, well, that looks tasty, and it's so ingrained into society that the general masses, who are, unfortunately, really stupid, are going to fall for it.
8502512	8504033	You know what I think is very funny?
8504113	8508836	I don't know if this goes hand in hand, but since I stopped watching TV so much, I've eaten out so often.
8509116	8510757	At least at major chains.
8511677	8514459	There's this one lady that works at McDonald's that has no teeth.
8517586	8520927	The whole thing is that it's a matter of choice in using your brain.
8521468	8524449	And unfortunately, people just don't know how to use their brain.
8524489	8526710	They want to be sheep like everybody else.
8526910	8530091	There was this one chick at the McDonald's that we used to go to, actually.
8530231	8532552	It's just some Chinese chick with an eye patch.
8532672	8535193	We used to go, Arrgh!
8535893	8538334	Every time we'd get our stuff from her, it was quite funny.
8538374	8539155	That's kind of mean.
8540895	8543156	Arrgh, matey!
8543176	8544097	Hand over me Big Mac!
8546894	8549076	One thing I have to say about McDonald's.
8549156	8557865	One time I went to McDonald's, this one right by my work, and I ordered two hamburgers without cheese and without onions because I cannot fucking stand McDonald's onions.
8557885	8559486	That's the nastiest fucking shit on this earth.
8559746	8560727	Dehydrated onions?
8560747	8561888	What the hell is up with that?
8561969	8562529	They're awesome.
8562549	8562969	They're awesome.
8563010	8563330	I love them.
8563650	8564991	Gross.
8565271	8565631	Anyway.
8566391	8569733	Well, F you to Bradley for liking McDonald's onions.
8570013	8573914	Okay, so, I order my burger without cheese and without onions, right?
8574055	8576736	I get it back to work, I open it up, and what do I find?
8577036	8579517	I go, gosh, this hamburger seems awfully thin.
8579857	8581918	I bite into it, no meat.
8583839	8586680	I bit into two pieces of bread covered in ketchup and mustard and pickles.
8588294	8589095	Fuck McDonald's.
8589235	8589555	God.
8589956	8590756	But this is what happened.
8591217	8593238	My co-worker called them.
8593439	8596121	Since I'm kind of a pussy, I let people walk all over me like that.
8596802	8600845	My co-worker heard me show, I was running, of course, only the way I can do.
8600905	8603187	I started, you know, what's the first thing I'm going to do when I get a bad burger?
8603227	8605890	I run around and show all my co-workers, oh, look how McDonald's fucked me over.
8606210	8607091	And I'm like, well, let's eat a burger.
8607131	8608272	And I open it up where I took a bite.
8609333	8611534	And my co-worker's like, you're not going to put up with that crap, are you?
8611595	8613937	So he calls and he got me two free meals at McDonald's.
8615038	8618560	This was about six weeks ago and I still haven't used my free meals at McDonald's.
8619221	8620602	It's like, here, more poison for you.
8621703	8628068	So if you want a free meal at McDonald's, just go over to McDonald's on Madison and Hazel and tell them that... Never mind, I'm not going to tell you who sent you.
8629149	8629990	It's not under my name.
8630310	8631731	Madison and Hazel.
8632872	8633232	Alright.
8634173	8635014	They're dumbasses.
8635054	8636455	That was the same place I went there.
8636795	8643460	We're getting our meal and the guy's talking through the PA system out where the drive-thru stuff is.
8643480	8643721	He's like...
8644461	8662095	Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, I know you can hear me, Kenny, meanwhile we're sitting in the window going, food, give us our food, Kenny, give me a six dollar burger, Kenny, Kenny,
8662856	8663576	Kenny!
8664276	8664897	Kenny!
8665237	8667977	I'm like, fucker, just give me the goddamn food!
8668057	8670578	It was like sitting on the back counter.
8670778	8672158	I could see it with my own eyes.
8672178	8675299	I'm like, can't reach food!
8675319	8677600	He's like, Kenny!
8677620	8679820	The guy was a fucking dumbass.
8680340	8680980	That's all I have to say.
8681040	8682241	Oh my god, they killed Kenny.
8684761	8686762	Ah, yes, Orange Beanie is saying, meat is bad.
8687142	8688882	Just be a vegetarian and don't eat at McDonald's at all.
8688902	8689422	Meat is bad.
8690683	8692263	Except I eat chicken still, but...
8693351	8698273	I used to date a vegan and it was really interesting going to McDonald's because they couldn't even eat the fries, really.
8698653	8700053	So... Oh, you gotta go?
8700573	8701094	Was that your pager?
8701134	8701434	Bye, JB.
8701474	8702234	Say bye to everybody.
8702294	8703294	Any closing thoughts from JB?
8703594	8704034	Ginny rum?
8704395	8704815	Ginny rum.
8705095	8705575	Thank you, JB.
8706495	8708416	Need pork, daddy!
8710407	8713430	I'm gonna get drunk and sue Budweiser Hey fat people, what's this one say?
8725521	8725801	Hey, Rob.
8749833	8754797	There's another headline I saw on Yahoo, because you know Yahoo has always the best headlines.
8755157	8761002	It was some stupid kid, they threw a flaming chair at this kid in the back of a pickup truck.
8762503	8765325	And this kid was part of it, and they were filming him.
8766326	8771150	It was one of those jackass... And he got hurt, and they said, oh, it must have been from a jackass stunt.
8772270	8777272	I'm like, what, so every dumb thing that stupid kids do and catch on camera is a jackass stunt?
8777532	8777792	Yes.
8778733	8779093	No.
8780013	8780653	I don't think so.
8781013	8782974	It's funny, doesn't he have a part where he can rate the top?
8782994	8783654	Loki don't play that.
8784295	8785235	I don't play that shit.
8787205	8787885	You know what I think?
8788686	8812894	I think that all those, back to the topic at hand, the fast food crap, I think that those places, actually, they need to be, if they were subsidized for having a healthy menu and high quality food, which they could still make just as fast as the cheap crap that, you know, is so bad for you, if they were offered a government subsidy for providing good food to people,
8814563	8825046	That would actually, I think, improve a lot of the health of their consumers and possibly get them repeat business, but the other thing is our government doesn't give a shit about it anyway.
8825387	8827427	Well, they've kind of improved their stuff.
8827447	8834049	I mean, they changed their fry recipe around to make it, like, a lot less oil and there's less fat grams and stuff in there, so they're doing stuff.
8834109	8835370	I mean, why...
8836230	8836490	Why?
8836550	8838691	I mean, we go there, we know what's in the food.
8839011	8842352	We know that it's not meat between those patties, or between the bread.
8842372	8847334	Even so, as a manufacturer, you do have a responsibility to your consumer.
8847514	8849915	What about if they just put a DDR machine in every McDonald's?
8851536	8852837	Two Big Macs and Shitty Rom!
8852877	8853597	What's that?
8854917	8856218	That's that game for fags.
8857543	8860164	Oh, I'm going to eat my burger.
8861625	8863226	Oh, heart attack.
8863326	8865047	Ugh, die.
8865607	8872990	It just has to do with people caring enough about themselves and being smart enough to know what's good for them.
8873250	8874291	Love yourself.
8874651	8875472	DarkSakura.com
8891912	8894713	Like, there's this bagel cafe place near where I work.
8894813	8899735	I can go there and get a turkey sandwich with avocado and no mayonnaise and everything, and that's nice and healthy.
8900115	8904697	Or I could go get, you know, freshly made teriyaki at another place just as fast.
8905317	8919483	You know, it's certainly more satisfying than going and getting a piece of bread that's been in a bag for five years and this piece of something that's supposed to resemble meat that, you know, probably still has the green ink stamp from when they stamped the damn thing in the first place.
8920283	8934174	and, you know, you can look at this, you can pay, you know, five dollars and get this unsatisfying, you know, piece of shit burger and, you know, this soda which you're actually paying about ten times what the value of the soda is.
8934194	8938337	Or you can go buy a bottle of juice and get yourself a nice sandwich and...
8939117	8941178	Overall, your body is going to thank you for it.
8941798	8949020	People who complain they don't have any energy, they're not going to have that complaint anymore because they're actually going to be fueling themselves.
8949060	8950181	There's the difference right there.
8950781	8956843	Also, there have been studies linked that prove that eating a consistent diet of fast food also does contribute to stupidity.
8958483	8964125	Your brain doesn't function as properly when you're eating nothing but shit.
8964605	8965866	Actually, I heard just the opposite.
8966166	8977355	They just did a study on the news saying that snack foods give actually higher test results during a short period of time.
8977815	8979136	That's not fast food, though.
8979576	8983339	The thing is, if you eat any carbohydrate, it's going to increase your brain function.
8984020	8986401	Bombay has another great suggestion in the chat room.
8986762	8988703	How about you cook instead of eating at a fast food place?
8988883	8989524	Exactly!
8990760	8994122	I'm just talking about for people like when you're at work and you haven't brought your lunch or something.
8994142	8995143	You know, there's alternatives.
8995163	8997764	Because I'm lazy and McDonald's takes two minutes to get, okay?
8998124	8999405	That's what it comes down to.
8999445	9000926	And I love their goddamn fries.
9001586	9002927	I can't stand the stupid people.
9002947	9004268	I can't stand to go inside there.
9004288	9007389	I can't stand to smell the ugly, nasty people that are in there.
9007630	9008690	The smell is horrible.
9008710	9011352	This also goes back to those people who are on those low-carb diets.
9012172	9017377	They don't realize that when they're eating no carbohydrates, they're actually killing themselves.
9018257	9022501	The state of ketosis, basically, is the state that your body goes into when it's about to die.
9023262	9024603	When it starts feeding on itself.
9025944	9034331	Those are the same... Okay, the same people that are making this argument right here are the same people who go and supersize their extra value meal and they get Diet Coke.
9036515	9037216	That saves them.
9037256	9038697	You know how many calories that saves them?
9038937	9040178	They're making Diet Vanilla Coke now.
9040198	9040598	Did you hear that?
9041039	9043981	I've seen it.
9044542	9046523	Say that you're going to Burger King and you're getting a Whopper.
9046563	9049345	First of all, a Whopper has a calorie count of 750 calories.
9049846	9050827	Your typical Whopper does.
9051687	9053389	When you add your fries to it, you're adding on another 300.
9053529	9058833	Right there, you have in your hands the entire equivalent of a day's meal.
9059253	9060795	I mean, an entire...
9062717	9065879	You have your whole day of eating in one meal.
9067119	9071962	Changing your coke from regular to diet, you're basically removing 200 calories of that.
9071982	9073963	That's incredibly stupid, but you know what?
9074063	9075043	That's how they make their money.
9076664	9079225	I drink 300 calorie hot chocolate.
9082707	9084007	You're getting some dairy from it.
9085308	9086749	Actually, it's instant hot chocolate.
9088229	9089390	They have enzymes in them.
9090979	9093301	It's so chocolatey and good, I can't deny it.
9093841	9098204	It's actually three packets of hot chocolate mix, because one and two are just not enough.
9099264	9100905	Also, chocolate is good for your endorphins.
9101446	9104367	It helps you release happy chemicals.
9105408	9106068	Sounds happy.
9106629	9108650	Yeah, it's a aphrodisiac.
9110683	9111424	Thanks for watching!
9129366	9132669	Maybe we should make this a regular thing, you know, health talk.
9133469	9135811	Health chat, DDR dieting, workout mode.
9135971	9136732	Well, seriously.
9136792	9137292	On Orange Lounge.
9137312	9142195	You know, it also goes hand-in-hand with playing, you know, the DDR and pata pata.
9142296	9145518	No, this is why I agree that this topic's kind of, you know, relevant.
9145718	9148000	It actually really is relevant to the Bonnie community.
9148180	9151222	Because, like I said, a lot of people play Bonnie to stay fit.
9151282	9153244	It's one of the things that appeal to them about the game.
9153904	9156426	And I'm mad at Golfland because they're trying to make me impotent.
9156446	9157807	Blank.
9158160	9161843	Link, they got rid of my surge and replaced it with Mountain Dew.
9163645	9165066	Mountain Dew's bad.
9165406	9166307	It tastes like pee.
9167147	9168328	I want my surge.
9168509	9170170	Oh my god, I don't drink... That's the nickname Mountain Spew.
9170190	9172031	That's all I ever drink is Mountain Dew.
9172892	9174233	Mountain Spew.
9174273	9176015	Does Mountain Dew really make you impotent?
9177916	9180478	It's just all the yellow sticks or whatever it is.
9180498	9182340	It isn't really going to matter for me anyway, but...
9184029	9186430	Ah, they're saying sushi is good.
9186771	9190753	And Orange Beanie says the only meat he'll eat is sushi on occasion.
9191073	9193334	And then Swift Rock says McDonald's should get sushi.
9194315	9201799	McDonald's would, then you'd get like, you'd get like the imitation crab wrapped up in cabbage instead of nori.
9202799	9206081	And an old bun to replace the rice.
9206461	9209683	If you, if you did get rice crackers and soak them in water.
9210783	9216886	Not, well, not, you know, the big rice cakes and soak them in water and then wrap those around a piece of imitation crab meat and cover it in cabbage.
9218146	9223989	I'm being told to look at a Gran Turismo Vice City story I apparently missed that was going on.
9224009	9225570	Gran Turismo Vice City, shit!
9225590	9229471	Let's see, um... You fucker, you're going faster, man, we're gonna kill you!
9229732	9234754	Okay, SoCalKick says he was watching Channel 4 and this was the explanation of Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
9235274	9235934	Did I say Grand Theft Auto?
9235954	9236294	I'm sorry.
9236415	9237055	Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
9237075	9238815	Oh yeah, that's right, there was supposed to be a news report on that.
9238835	9246278	Yes, on Channel 4 they said, in the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City, players must beat women, kill police, and have sex with prostitutes to progress in the game.
9246819	9247719	Uh, no.
9248619	9249480	Kill police, yes.
9251266	9251986	Oh, that's optional.
9252006	9252567	Cop killer.
9252847	9253707	That's optional.
9253788	9258490	I mean, I always just, you know, I fire lots of rockets and watch people explode.
9259271	9262092	This is how much I actually play PlayStation games, by the way.
9262152	9264013	You didn't catch my big fuck up there.
9264194	9266975	That's not like, you know, a one-sided opinion there.
9267315	9271898	Well, you have to do this to, you know, what, first off... If you want the bonus stage, maybe.
9272098	9273819	Oh, first off, it's a complete lie.
9274259	9275840	Okay, complete lie right there.
9275900	9277921	Just totally slandering the game right there.
9279502	9280443	Stupid bastards.
9280563	9281343	Oh well, it doesn't matter.
9281644	9282384	No matter what they say.
9282424	9289709	In fact, yeah, it's going to give them more ratings and more, you know, people are like, oh, cool, that game looks like fun and it's going to sell more copies.
9289769	9295532	It was the highest selling, highest grossing game last year, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3.
9296172	9297593	So now this time it's going to be even better.
9299234	9300215	And it has a storyline.
9300595	9302596	It has to do with a drug deal that went bad.
9304197	9306098	And you have to go kill the people that stole your money.
9308340	9308720	Well, thank you.
9309232	9309953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9330652	9331973	DDR Max USA DDR Max USA
9354275	9355136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9375659	9378401	There's no excuse for bad customer service.
9379041	9379902	And keep in mind this.
9380422	9386707	For every one person who calls in and complains or does a physical complaint, there are eight more people who are displeased.
9387607	9389669	And each of these people will go and tell more people.
9390069	9393311	The thing is, if we had more activists in the world, stuff would change.
9393951	9397474	And so I think that that's my part in trying to make things a little bit better.
9398365	9401926	So Jamie and I didn't get to play Max in front of a bunch of strangers and we cry.
9402907	9403607	I had a sniff.
9404227	9409509	But it was kind of interesting how Fries has really been promoting DDR around here especially.
9409529	9410189	I did have a run.
9410269	9414731	Because I literally, we watched what, like two or three people, at least I noticed this, I didn't really say anything to you about it.
9415271	9422854	But I saw, like, two or three people, no, not the ones playing the game, but, like, families picking up DDR and a dance pad, like, walking out there.
9422874	9440242	And the employees, this is kind of smart, they did have an employee kind of stationed near the DDR, watching the people play, apparently not keeping very good track, but watching the people play, and then when parents would kind of look at it curiously, would go up and talk to them about DDR, and suddenly they're walking out of there with a copy of Max USA, and one of them was walking out with a PlayStation 2.
9440722	9442143	My boss bought Konomics for herself.
9442903	9443103	See?
9444143	9445924	Make sure that you buy your games at GameStop.
9446104	9446424	Thank you.
9448704	9448884	Yes.
9449344	9450085	Buy them at GameStop.
9450685	9453485	Reserve your games at the GameStop in Richard Quarter.
9454906	9456406	Jamie's trying to get a little bit of business there.
9456826	9457546	For my man.
9457726	9457966	Yes.
9458747	9459907	Let me know.
9460027	9463908	I guess that's a really great way to promote DDR.
9463928	9465548	It's too bad more stores don't do that.
9466451	9470712	I also did find another couple cool things at Fry's, speaking of our little trip to Fry's.
9471012	9471272	Okay.
9471872	9473853	One of my favorite artists ever.
9474013	9480854	I didn't think that any of his stuff was released in the U.S., and I was wrong, because I found three DJ Crush CDs at Fry's.
9481774	9482855	That makes me happy.
9483855	9485775	And I saw the super ghetto cheap CD burners.
9485815	9486415	That made me happy.
9486735	9486935	Yep.
9487235	9488136	They were really cheap.
9488916	9489076	Yep.
9490316	9492997	Okay, so that was our Fry's story, and that's about it.
9493257	9494337	Oh, Loki has something to share.
9496707	9499332	Damn you Friesen making me sped money.
9499393	9503541	I go there with an intent of buying one thing and I walk out with eight things.
9503721	9504763	I hate you!
9505725	9506787	Being so cheap!
9508317	9509978	I got my man a really cool birthday present.
9510018	9520805	And by the way, we need to give, even though he's not listening and stuff, I have to give a happy birthday to my fiancé Dan, because he's absolutely awesome.
9521006	9521086	Aww.
9521106	9532213	Yeah, if ever you see him online, he's either online as NeoStrider, he used to run the NeoStrider Strider Zone, and he also goes by the handle GunstarHero a lot.
9532373	9533554	My man's an old school gamer.
9534234	9537757	But he's going to be 27 on Friday, and I got him a really cool gift.
9538657	9545502	I don't know if anyone has seen the little mini RC cars, like the Initial D cars and the Digi-Q cars.
9546262	9548904	Fry's are selling the Digi-Q tracks, the Japanese ones.
9549584	9551065	And that's what I picked him up for his birthday.
9552126	9552486	Uh-oh.
9553227	9553727	Boom.
9554267	9558170	So, happy birthday to my man, even though he's probably not listening.
9559735	9561917	And I hope he's not listening because I just told him his birthday present was.
9563138	9563958	That would be bad, yes.
9564999	9566480	I'm going to play some stuff for you.
9566500	9571764	We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back to wrap up the rest of the show.
9571944	9575806	Let's start this one off with something a little bit disco.
9575846	9577007	I know you guys kind of like this song.
9577027	9577928	We'll play this for you guys.
9578528	9580790	And we will be right back.
9695530	9696592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9718015	9718997	Thank you for watching!
9737151	9738011	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9773300	9777921	You don't need another one No matter how much I get hurt
9811633	9812614	Thank you for watching!
9840695	9841457	Thanks for watching!
9873117	9876458	Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
9876659	9878399	It's a good place to listen to the music.
9883171	9897159	You are back, and it's funny, in the chat room they're talking about this Gacked Another World sounds just like the Josie and the Pussycats song Three Small Words, and they're absolutely right, because that racked my brain for an entire day one time.
9897419	9898560	It's okay, but it's better.
9900785	9902206	Yeah, I like Another World a lot.
9902326	9903346	I mean, and it is different.
9903386	9904226	The chorus is a lot different.
9904266	9905627	We actually did play the Gagged version.
9905647	9906487	The guitar is just very similar.
9906547	9907167	The guitar is very similar.
9907187	9908808	We actually did play the Gagged version, by the way.
9908828	9911029	Which is the only good one that exists.
9911269	9917331	I was supposed to relay a message to Loki from SoCalKicks, but I lost it, so retype that in the chatroom, SoCal, and I'll get that.
9921473	9922333	No, I don't think it was more work.
9922373	9924174	I think it was something more about Grand Theft Auto.
9925174	9926535	Eh, stupid news.
9927330	9931713	All local news sucks because they're stupid and uninformed about anything current.
9931753	9933614	Especially anything that has to do with gaming.
9934014	9936695	Like, those crazy kids and their games.
9936715	9938176	They're so stupid.
9939217	9940437	Yeah.
9941498	9942238	That was special.
9943669	9944049	DarkSakura.com
9963241	9963661	DarkSakura.com
9983044	9985905	Why is VidPower suggesting Animal Crossing Vice City?
9986426	9987166	No.
9987186	9990788	That would be pretty funny though.
9990808	9994229	I'd be able to shoot Mallory finally.
9994809	9995690	I like Mallory.
9995710	9997791	I'd pop a cap in her ass.
9997891	9998971	I like Mallory.
9999091	10000952	Mallory gives me stuff all the time.
10002513	10004814	Now what would be crazy is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
10004834	10006875	But that's okay because I like puddles and you don't like her.
10009549	10012591	Black Lab wants to point out that the Boba at Boba, Max is broken.
10039185	10040165	We're going there for Boba.
10040226	10041126	Alright, we're going there for Boba.
10041146	10041527	That's fine.
10041867	10042447	We're still coming.
10043108	10043388	Alright.
10043989	10046291	Now this is what SoCalKicks wanted to tell you.
10046992	10048113	Loki, that's what they do.
10048233	10051255	Do you even know why every supermarket has milk in the back?
10051395	10052977	It's just like a mental thing.
10053317	10055879	Most people just go to a supermarket often just for milk.
10056000	10058722	If it's in the back, they have to go all the way to the back.
10058962	10060684	And then for some reason to pick up other things.
10061294	10066604	Yeah, it's because they, they, you know, arrange supermarkets and stuff to promote buying.
10066984	10067305	Duh.
10067806	10072915	But, I mean, that has nothing to do with the fact that, you know, they're saying the game is, you know,
10074568	10075589	Oh yeah, talking about Fry's, yeah.
10075789	10075889	Oh.
10076750	10079232	I think, I don't know what that was exactly in reference to.
10079252	10080753	Yeah, Fry's is like a giant maze.
10080934	10084957	It's like a giant hedge maze that you have to walk through just to get to the checkout counter.
10085558	10087479	Giant hedge maze, that's all you have to remember.
10087759	10092323	But it's not the fact that they arrange stuff like that, it's just the fact that they're so cheap.
10092824	10094265	So cheap that you can't resist.
10094585	10096207	But the problem is, they're all mail-in rebates...
10097168	10098329	PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3
10117887	10121751	Well, first thing I'm going to be doing is getting DDR Max 2 when that comes out.
10122572	10126196	So, you know, I can rip everything from that and whatnot.
10126276	10131461	But I'm also, one of the first games I'm getting, which I'm also bidding on, is Para Para Para.
10132663	10133103	I'm not...
10138869	10151516	Um, yeah, but there's, I don't know, there's a bunch of other games, like, you guys are trying to get me into Beatmania 2DX, and I'm thinking that's an expensive investment for something I'm not too excited to be playing, but, I don't know.
10151536	10159580	There's also the Drummania, um, drum, I wanted to get the drum set for that, and, uh, maybe Drummania or something, I don't know.
10159600	10159960	What was it again?
10161055	10161716	Session Mode is so cool.
10161776	10162056	Yeah.
10162116	10164619	Uh, being told that Grand Theft Auto Crime Online is said to be real.
10164639	10164780	Uh-oh.
10165120	10165761	Hide your children!
10180501	10183402	and Loki, you don't want Para Para, it gets boring in three days.
10183662	10188084	Actually, I'm not sure if he's talking about Para or Drum Mania, but he's saying, you don't want it, it gets boring in three days, that's DCB.
10188464	10192606	Well, I know that, duh, I don't play games like after three days anyways.
10193226	10200449	Another reason why I'd want Para Para is just for the controller, because I get to use it with Step Mania, and oh yeah, I get to put some crazy shit in there.
10201190	10206432	Basically, it'd be like a really tripped out version of Dance Maniacs.
10206452	10208793	They'll have to do it for now until I... He is talking about Para.
10209386	10210707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10227535	10228736	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
10228756	10229517	You got the name wrong.
10229597	10229957	I'm sorry.
10230037	10231338	The Pink Biscuits of Death.
10231518	10232579	The Pink Biscuits of Death.
10232979	10233980	I like pink pancakes.
10235001	10237483	They're too big to be pancakes.
10237643	10238584	They're fat pancakes.
10238764	10243487	Well, they were saying also that I should get, um, what was it, um, Kingdom Hearts International when that comes out.
10244488	10246490	And Final Fantasy International.
10246590	10248511	Hell, I can get Final Fantasy XI right now, I guess.
10249392	10251454	I don't know why I'd want to, but... Oh, he's...
10253786	10258628	Swiftrock is offering to give away his Parapara for a Milpitas Golfland token.
10260228	10260488	Okay.
10264230	10264630	Okay.
10266351	10273313	Well, go ahead and email the show at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll forward that on to Loki and you guys can set that up.
10273533	10275394	I think you might have a Golfland token to spare.
10276254	10276574	Yeah.
10276774	10277315	All right, cool.
10277335	10278055	I can get one.
10278875	10279696	Look up at the wall.
10279876	10281257	We actually have a Gothland token.
10281277	10283540	Yeah, there's a Gothland token sitting right up on the wall.
10283760	10284280	You can have that.
10284300	10285261	You can borrow it to get the para-para.
10285281	10287443	I'll just take two para-para controllers.
10287503	10290206	I mean, I think you can, like, do something with that.
10290226	10292108	You can play two people para-para.
10292168	10292548	Woo-hoo.
10292568	10293569	You can have a para-party.
10295504	10299846	Paraparty, it'll go well with the masturbation party.
10301687	10305568	By the way, by the way, by the way, MakeEditGetPorn is still on.
10306429	10310310	And, uh, yeah, I haven't really thought of a date yet that I want to judge everything.
10310570	10311791	I'm just being lazy, so.
10312291	10315592	In the meantime, MakeEdit, for anything that's on, MaxUSA.
10316213	10323115	And I don't care how you make it, just get me a step chart or edit file or DWI or step menu file somehow.
10323896	10324276	And, uh,
10324716	10326057	Yeah, and I'll enter it in.
10326997	10327578	You can do it!
10328118	10329259	And you can get porn!
10330399	10331240	Pornography.
10333341	10333782	Okay.
10334362	10335382	It's faptastic!
10335683	10340466	Yes, it's a faptastic contest being brought to you by the one and only Loki.
10340546	10345469	Ah, it's being suggested we should invite Paula Terry to our Pear Pear Paradise party slash masturbation party.
10345529	10345909	No.
10346649	10347390	God, no.
10347950	10349391	Unless we get to, like, take shots at her.
10351741	10352001	Alright.
10352021	10360586	She can't sing, but you know, if she were to be, like, I don't know, gagged somehow, I'll let your mind do the work.
10360606	10361946	You got some Paraparadise you can gag her with?
10364386	10365467	I got a pink biscuit for ya!
10366707	10367868	Stick the mic closer.
10368708	10369248	That's right.
10369909	10371049	Oh yeah, you know you like it.
10372170	10378232	Anyway, we're getting close to the end of the show here, so I thought I'd go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.
10378252	10380013	Dude, Matt, you are one sick fuck.
10380694	10382654	That's Jamie's final thought, is Matt is a sick fuck?
10384956	10385456	Yeah.
10387276	10388277	That's correct.
10388777	10390238	Loki, your final thought for the day.
10391439	10393360	Uh... I don't know.
10394401	10395021	I'm tired.
10395502	10396022	You're tired.
10396062	10396962	It's Gendo.
10397223	10397923	Oh, that's right.
10398243	10399504	My bitches will do anything.
10400625	10401405	Okay, well, maybe not that.
10405448	10408930	Bradley, have any... My women are always on top.
10409210	10409290	And...
10416806	10417546	Final Thought of the Day.
10417647	10419928	Run away, run away, run, run far away, and then run back.
10421169	10421449	What?
10422609	10423710	That was great.
10424510	10425791	That was great.
10427512	10428172	I didn't get it.
10429413	10430934	Gendo, are you a pimp?
10431594	10431935	No!
10434556	10435557	That didn't do anything.
10435837	10436117	I know.
10436337	10437418	I just like that song.
10439156	10440757	Attention, Kmart shoppers.
10442258	10444480	Attention, attention, Kmart shoppers.
10444740	10446601	This is Gendo.
10447421	10451784	Please report to my office for breast inspection.
10453465	10454826	Damn it, I hate this part.
10456687	10457348	Oh, baby.
10459116	10468538	I love the scene in that where Shinji's in front of the elevator and the elevator opens and it's the Gendo music and then it closes and the music goes away.
10468858	10474840	We're talking about an anime parody of Evangelion called Evangelion Re-Death.
10476020	10477540	It's completely on crack.
10477820	10481021	That's where the It's Gendo line comes from in the intro.
10481161	10481521	Yay.
10482561	10484102	And we're just quoting it because we can.
10484822	10485642	We're nerds.
10486482	10490083	The best one, though, has to be Fanboy Bebop.
10490323	10492824	That is, oh, so funny.
10494285	10494825	So funny.
10494865	10502607	It's like, it starts off, the whole thing shows this ship, and it shows, like, his anime collection, and it says, you know, like, Sailor Moon and stuff, and then it's all hentai.
10503728	10507369	And it shows, like, this long hallway full of videos, and it's all hentai.
10507949	10509129	It's hilarious.
10509990	10510750	Definitely watch it.
10511451	10515316	What else I have on that tape is Jube Powers, International Man of Intercourse.
10515837	10517980	It sucks, but I love the part with the looping ninjas.
10519121	10520203	That part was funny.
10521024	10526111	The looped animation of the ninja running in and out with the 70s porn music.
10526468	10528769	JB wanted to share something with us all.
10529870	10531531	JB wanted to share this with us all.
10531611	10535393	Politary.com Is this the same one?
10535433	10535973	Is it really?
10536414	10537134	I think it might be.
10537454	10541376	Yeah, under the events section you'll find information regarding different performances in and around Japan.
10542957	10543958	Oh, and you can email her.
10545973	10548657	Oh yeah.
10549117	10550760	She looks sort of like Phoebe.
10552382	10553424	Smelly cat.
10554425	10555587	Smelly cat.
10556288	10557350	Smelly cat.
10559112	10559473	Let's see.
10559533	10560775	Let's see Politary's bio.
10561769	10567075	Apollo was born in Australia in a musical family with his famous opera singer mother and a highly skilled classical guitarist brother.
10567115	10569859	She began vocal training at the age of 6 and lived in France until the age of 16.
10569899	10570579	Hold that thought right there.
10570800	10570960	Yes.
10571060	10578749	Where she was then sold to slave trader Naoki, where she became his sex slash singing...
10580170	10580931	Oh, she's married!
10582132	10583974	It says, does my wedding count under events?
10584214	10586276	We might have to go with this a little more next week.
10586296	10588618	It doesn't say anything about Bomani, I see.
10589199	10590620	Oh, here we go, Love Again Tonight's in there.
10590640	10591661	Hey, well, didn't you hear?
10591781	10593623	Naoki's Naoki Terry now.
10594383	10594984	He took her name.
10597266	10601150	Oh, I just clicked on email, and now it's trying to get me... Oh, I can send her an email!
10601170	10601210	Oh!
10603704	10607847	Dude, we need to send her an email and get her to listen to the show.
