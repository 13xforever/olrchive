2165	3046	Message for you, son!
3486	4127	Attention!
5347	8850	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10851	13373	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
13713	15895	Mamani Talk, and then some.
19549	22450	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22790	25971	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26531	29252	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29792	32673	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33473	33874	Just kidding.
34074	35674	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35894	43036	In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?
43056	46057	That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
46157	47758	What's your favorite scary?
49312	49912	Showgirls.
50792	51673	Absolute fright.
52213	52793	What's yours?
53033	55513	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55553	56874	Don't torture yourself.
57454	58314	That's my job.
58394	60214	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
60254	64875	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
65275	66196	I know Kung Fu.
66576	68936	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69196	71057	Why did they have to take the word gang?
72657	75298	No one expects a punishing position.
75578	76418	It's gender.
76458	76858	Hey!
79264	86089	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio, and this is episode number 22 for December the 1st of 2002 at
103800	104060	I have a nut.
121798	122498	DarkSakura.com
148607	153429	Also tonight with us in studio, say hello to Brad, Yankee style.
154369	155129	You're not to taste good.
155189	157030	Okay, I'm going to go play animal.
157590	161071	And the happy little panda rice princess, say hello to Irene.
161671	163232	Hi, I'm going to go play animal.
165066	165407	Addicts.
165587	166428	You're all addicts.
167109	168010	We'll be talking to them more.
168030	171676	We're going to do listless tonight, so they'll be back for listless a little later in the show.
171696	175060	First, we're going to take a really quick break, feature you some requests.
175201	176002	So we can eat more nuts.
176262	179146	And we're going to eat more nuts, and we'll be right back to talk about all things Bomani.
179407	180128	And then some.
180368	180729	See you then.
201340	201921	Thanks for watching!
222894	224275	That's a boring story.
224355	226496	I don't have a girlfriend right now.
256278	257680	Thank you for watching!
457162	457624	Thank you!
534615	537336	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
537376	538076	Orange Lounge Radio.
562699	564401	Hello, we are back live.
564421	565742	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
566162	567083	Dave's in the house.
567163	567583	What's up?
568024	568784	He's color coordinated.
568804	569084	What's up?
569205	570265	Yeah, I wear blue now.
570305	571006	That's all I wear.
571547	573328	You're so coordinated today.
573869	574929	Happy Hanukkah to you, Dave.
575910	576991	Yeah, I got Max USA.
579822	581583	Dave, by the way, is also our resident Jew.
582303	584284	Congratulations.
584965	586245	You've got to love the Jewish people, though.
586285	588266	I've never met a mean Jewish person.
588686	590527	Every Jewish person I've ever met has been completely nice.
591527	593608	Dave, kind of borderline, but good enough.
594569	595269	My grandmother.
598132	600054	No, I do like this color coordination thing you have going on.
600074	600334	Very nice.
600574	606218	You know, we were just playing that promo, the catch-up song promo, and I was thinking, Dave's the only person I know that actually knows the dance.
607119	609561	And I wish I'd known the other night when they were playing it at the club.
610501	611522	I don't know the dance.
611542	616946	I saw the five-second video of them doing, like, the, I don't know, the chimichanga dance or whatever it's called.
617687	618748	The cucaracha dance.
618788	619128	Yeah, that.
619929	623531	That's where you lay on your back and wave your hands and the feet in the air like a dead cockroach.
625553	626334	The cucaracha.
627412	631415	No, but the reason why I'm late is because... Are we just being totally random tonight?
632016	633077	Why are you tardy, sir?
633177	637961	Well, I figured you're just getting used to the 6.30 thing, because this is only, like, what, the third show we've been starting at 6.30?
638301	652752	Actually, I remembered at about 4 o'clock, I'm like, okay, well, I just borrowed Kingdom Hearts from my friend JJ, so I think I'll go play the Hades Cup now, which is 50 battles long, including at least five bosses.
653273	656936	So I started that, I'm not exactly sure when, because I had to level up a little bit,
657376	662000	And then I finally finished, I beat everyone, and I finished like 10 minutes ago.
662160	663961	And then I ran down and came over here.
665282	669085	Well, I suppose if we're going to get cast aside for Kingdom Hearts, there's not a lot we can do.
669265	670726	Animal Crossing stole me from Kingdom Hearts.
670746	671027	That's right.
671147	676731	Animal Crossing, by the way, is in the other room right now, and that's where Brad and Irene, they just came in in the beginning to say hello, and now they're back out there.
676751	681655	They'll be back for listless later on the show, but... I'm going to have to start playing Kingdom Hearts again because I'm only at Agrabah.
682335	684337	And I'm way over-leveled for where I am.
684737	692123	Being suggested in the chat room, apparently EOSFEB has this bookmarked, the link to the catch-up song video.
692483	694305	Because he sure was able to find that pretty fast.
694805	698809	So he wants us to watch that live on air, but unfortunately I can't do that.
698849	700150	I don't want to vomit on the microphone.
700230	702231	Yeah, we don't want to get Jamie to vomit on the microphone.
702271	708216	Also, if I try to watch streaming video, it eats up a lot of my resources, which means listeners get kicked from the live stream, and we don't want that to happen.
708556	710158	But we'll do that another time.
712135	716837	He says he wants to thank whoever made that video, so I'm assuming there's a lot of cleavage and boob shots.
716917	717638	Cleavage.
719979	720279	Anyway.
720719	722100	Yeah, let's hear it for tits.
724141	725821	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
725921	728602	As I say it, I'm a flat monotone.
731149	734952	Okay, we apologize also if you're hearing a hum in the background tonight.
734992	736313	We don't know what's causing it.
737393	744958	We're trying in studio here to take measures to not have it happen, but it's still happening, we think, so just bear with us tonight, please.
745738	745958	Yes.
747419	749000	Just pretend we're all doing yoga.
750121	755504	It's the incessant noise of Homer after he's like, Mmm, donut.
755544	755784	Beer.
755804	757986	72-ounce tub of beer.
761053	764737	You know, they sell these huge, huge, big old things at 7-Eleven now.
764757	766319	There's like, gotta be like 114 ounces.
766339	766840	The buckets.
766860	767781	The super buckets.
767801	771244	You didn't see the bucket that I bought Dan at Great America.
771805	772145	What's that?
772185	773267	We were there to see Margaret Cho.
774168	777411	I bought this 100 and something ounce bucket.
778192	778893	Drink bucket.
779373	779714	For Dan.
781144	782225	Oh, I do remember seeing that.
782265	783406	Yes, it was for his coffee.
784508	786810	No, just for him to drink.
786830	787691	For orange soda.
788231	790434	You know, the 7-Eleven's having a special right now.
790454	793597	You can fill up any mug for 79 cents full of coffee.
794318	795018	Dude, I'll do that.
795058	797201	I'll bring that thing and fill it up full of coffee and take it to work.
797241	798842	You should make your ghetto mochas.
799143	800364	I did my ghetto mocha's own.
802486	803187	The ghetto mocha...
804111	809914	You take really strong coffee, and then you put in Swiss Mist chocolate mix.
810894	817837	Add in a tablespoon of hazelnut creamer, and then like half a spoonful of sugar.
818677	821899	Mix that up, add more coffee to mix everything else up, and then drink it.
821919	825240	You'll be awake all day for the next week.
827141	829602	Oh, you're going to go get sucked in Animal Crossing 2 as well.
829922	831783	I've heard so much about it, how can I resist?
831823	832003	Right.
833937	836023	fine, fine you didn't even eat my nuts
839918	841059	Oh, now Bradley's here.
841079	844661	Dang, is there a party going on at the house today that I don't know about, apparently?
844761	846082	Alright, let's say hello to Bradley.
846162	847143	How you doing, Bradley?
847223	847703	I'm doing okay.
848443	849324	You just ran over here.
849364	851325	You were in the chat room, the exit, and now here you are.
851565	854387	Now, you came to finally get your 2DX controller this week, right?
854567	854787	Yes.
854867	855828	Unless I forget again.
856088	856788	I'll come back again.
857629	859470	I swear I haven't played it at all.
859490	863953	Well, obviously, we have Animal Crossing now, so we got sucked into that.
863973	867215	So, there's no use for my PlayStation anymore, because, you know, we've got Animal Crossing.
867595	870737	Screw Bomani, this is now a show all about Animal Crossing.
871298	872358	Oh my god, that Mallory.
872378	874380	It's the I hate Mallory show.
874400	876201	I like Mallory.
876221	876961	Just kidding, just kidding.
876981	877982	Mallory gives me stuff.
878802	881904	Well, you hear that Olivia is the troublemaker in our town, who moved from your town.
881924	883225	I don't want Olivia back.
884026	884866	You're abusing Olivia.
884966	889149	Anyway, I do have to say also though, of course, a big, big thank you to Loki.
890850	892471	Thanks for watching!
911816	916839	But Loki spent a little money to get a GameCube and an Animal Crossing for the house.
917359	919340	We deeply appreciate it, so thank you very much.
919360	919840	You're welcome.
920660	921621	Alright, cool.
922801	926743	Let's start the show off tonight by visiting the old mailbag.
926823	936108	If you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And so right now we're going to open up the mailbag and take a look.
936668	938269	Because we've got some mail this week.
938329	938409	We...
939207	941088	Let's see, going into the mailbag.
941488	943269	OrangeLawnTrailYahoo.com Oh, look!
943789	944570	One new message!
946331	948912	Hey, that's one more email than we had last week.
949272	950633	Yes, and I feel so special.
952114	952474	Alright.
953531	953771	Happy Crack!
984122	985023	Also known as Propel.
985583	985984	Propel?
986364	987165	You're on Propel.
987845	988646	Loki, what are you on?
989827	990828	I'm not on anything.
991108	992169	I just like this.
993750	995612	I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.
995652	996633	I'm high on life.
996933	998654	I prefer Happy Crack.
999115	999955	I'm on God.
1000156	1003078	No, I'm just kidding.
1003759	1006301	Okay, not that there's anything wrong with that.
1009460	1012062	If all goes well later, I'll be on a stranger's bed.
1012122	1014444	No, uh, just kidding, just kidding.
1015084	1016505	That's going to be enough boy porn.
1021849	1025512	Question number two, Martin wants to know, no, it's all about man porn.
1025552	1026753	I'm not a boy, I'm a man.
1027854	1031937	Alright, question number two for Martin, can he have some?
1032277	1033338	Sure, go to Walgreens.
1034355	1036078	Go Walgreens and get some Propel.
1037121	1037441	All right.
1038243	1041148	As we discussed, I'm not on anything, so to have... No.
1043455	1043916	You can't.
1043936	1046278	You can't have any of me.
1046378	1047199	I'm too good for you.
1047379	1048000	Too good for you.
1048360	1050663	And unfortunately, you can't have any of my life.
1051544	1055087	You can probably get some man porn if you go down to your local video store.
1055367	1056849	Rob, are you running out of time?
1056869	1058651	Do you need a time transplant?
1059031	1059351	Yes.
1060012	1061253	I need to go back to high school.
1061754	1062555	I missed out on so much.
1064456	1065137	Okay, you know what?
1065217	1066719	Martin, if you send us your address...
1067481	1068882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1093138	1095359	You'd almost think we're a real radio station or something.
1095900	1099041	Yeah, give us your address, we'll send you flavored water.
1099861	1102323	Next!
1102703	1105524	Alright, we didn't say what it was going to be, flavored ass.
1106004	1109386	Mmm, pea-flavored propel, yuck.
1109606	1112947	Mmm, urination, the best nation in the world.
1115528	1116369	You're disgusting.
1118197	1119638	Alright, question number three.
1119838	1122800	Why does the chat room not work on my fucking computer?
1122921	1124622	Send us your fucking computer stats.
1124822	1126783	Let me guess, you're using a Mac.
1126964	1128525	Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing.
1128765	1131987	You must be using a Mac.
1132007	1136130	I know it's a little difficult, and you might get confused with a toaster.
1136170	1137251	Now, here's how you can tell.
1137811	1138932	Can you put toast in it?
1139993	1140794	Does it make bagels?
1143240	1146141	If it does those two things, that's kind of difficult.
1146161	1150822	You might need to actually get a computer expert to determine whether it's a toaster or a Mac.
1150882	1152402	So, good luck there.
1152902	1155963	I only said that to piss off Black Lab, because I know he's listening right now.
1156023	1157663	We love you, Black Lab.
1157683	1158443	Love you, Black Lab.
1159123	1160544	Okay.
1161004	1166125	Black Lab, by the way, is a big Mac fan, so we occasionally knock on the Macs to piss him off.
1166245	1169746	And if actually Shark's girl's listening, she's a Mac whore, too.
1170286	1170906	She's a Mac-ette.
1179409	1182530	The best thing I can suggest is use the Java chat room.
1182750	1190593	All you have to do is go to our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and then you're going to just click on the chat page.
1191013	1195155	And then at the very bottom it'll say, if all these steps don't work, try our Java applet.
1195916	1200723	And I have to give thanks to Twen because he helped us get this Java applet working.
1201123	1202866	This handy little thing.
1203346	1204168	And that should work.
1204228	1207432	If your computer can view complex websites, you can run Java.
1207452	1209055	You can get into chat through that method.
1209115	1209655	So good luck.
1210116	1211458	And we hope to see you in the chat room tonight.
1213279	1215320	Question number four from Martin.
1215360	1218781	We're going through the email in our email bag at OrangeLionRadioYahoo.com right now.
1218861	1222742	Question number four is, how the hell did you know so much about the money?
1223022	1229223	Well, I'm glad you asked because this is the part where we get to inflate our egos a little bit talking about how old school we are, Jamie.
1230324	1232924	Gee, don't start on me or anything.
1233325	1234905	Do you want to go new schoolist to old schoolist?
1235919	1236641	Well, I can start.
1237543	1239468	Alright, Jamie's the most old school in the room.
1239970	1241935	Alright, um, let's see.
1242637	1244261	Not last year, year before.
1245152	1249774	I first played on the DDR machine at AX2000, I think it was.
1250394	1252615	Bradley was there, that's where I met Bradley.
1252695	1253496	On the May Expo 2000.
1254236	1257418	Yeah, I started playing in February of that year.
1257458	1259598	Actually, I had seen DDR the year before that.
1259618	1266822	I was in a Best of Move tournament, Best of Move 2, just trashing everybody until I got a faulty controller.
1267922	1269103	So it was in...
1270343	1275465	July of 1999 that I first saw DDR and I looked over and thought, that game looks stupid.
1276325	1282127	Until I heard someone playing, um, uh, what was that bus stop song?
1282147	1282747	Kung Fu Fighting.
1283827	1285908	And I was like, hey, it's Kung Fu Fighting, that's pretty cool.
1286468	1288269	And then I went over and looked at it and I'm like, oh.
1288489	1293891	And then I played DDR for the first time in February and my friend loaned me his PlayStation version and a dance pad.
1294251	1296592	Really crappy, they were probably one too, but I digress.
1297292	1297372	Um,
1298815	1310448	So, I was like, this DDR thing is cool, and then I came home from work one day in April, my birthday, and there was our Dreamcast set out with one of the nice dance pads and my own DDR second mix.
1310908	1313771	So I was happy, and I first played the machine, and, uh...
1315541	1327066	I remember being in there, seeing Xanadu, because I liked the movie, and I liked Olivia Newton-John.
1327546	1329507	And people would go, I thought you'd never played DDR before?
1330668	1333009	But, I like, this was a movie?
1333149	1337250	Hello, you know, Olivia Newton-John, Electric Light Orchestra, are you that young?
1337270	1337310	So...
1339324	1340745	And that's how it went from there.
1340905	1342066	September-ish.
1342126	1343608	No, maybe August or so.
1343628	1348932	Because Euclid Lane's got their DDR 1.5 and that started it.
1349913	1350253	Right on.
1350313	1355317	So, and just you've become such an addict over time that that's how you know so much about my money.
1355577	1358079	Yeah, I just kept finding more and more stuff that I liked.
1358139	1358540	Sounds good.
1358900	1360341	My story, I'll try to keep it brief.
1360521	1361602	Well, there's one other thing.
1361742	1362423	Oh, yeah, sorry.
1362723	1366766	I have this, you know, addiction to owning controllers.
1366846	1367107	So...
1369486	1371727	Ooh, we need my money again, I have to have a good controller for it!
1372207	1374028	And, yeah, anyway, okay, go ahead.
1387409	1389511	I don't remember, but it was Memorial Day some year.
1389691	1392053	I went and I actually went to Milpitas Golf Land.
1392514	1395477	And I think they were having a tournament because there were a lot of people there.
1395517	1398079	Now keep in mind, I knew nothing about, we were actually going there to golf.
1398459	1399781	I knew nothing about DDR or anything.
1399821	1400962	I saw the game, thought it was cool.
1401502	1405286	No chance in hell I was going to be playing because there was way too crowded around the machine.
1405786	1414951	But I actually ended up seeing the machine months later at a 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Convention in October of 2000, and that's when I played for the first time.
1415572	1419134	And a couple friends from the Rocky cast, including Rice Princess, was out in the other room.
1420455	1426698	We skipped out on the convention Friday night, and we stayed up and played DDR, and it was so much fun.
1427179	1428599	So that's when I got hooked on DDR.
1430401	1438108	and after that, let's see, I started playing when Roseville Golfland got USA Mix in something like, what, January?
1438989	1439309	I don't know.
1439549	1442412	So I started playing, no, it was December, December of two years ago.
1442552	1444053	I met you at Milpitas Golfland.
1444254	1446576	Yeah, so it's coming up, yeah, it's coming up two years.
1446756	1449939	So two years I've been playing Mamani and I just, what can I say, I'm addicted.
1450299	1451400	And I just, I'm a sponge.
1451440	1453262	I pick up every piece of information I hear online.
1454123	1462609	As far as the radio thing goes, I used to have my own college radio show for seven semesters back when I went to Chico State, so that's kind of where I picked up the radio thing.
1462649	1476921	And then I was co-hosting a program called Understation Live up until a couple months ago when our head host, Travis, had to leave, took off for Texas, and just kind of been doing the radio thing ever since.
1477301	1482646	Orange Lounge is, I guess at its core, Orange Lounge is somewhat of a spin-off of that show, but...
1483386	1483687	I don't know.
1483807	1484648	I don't know what you want to call it.
1485970	1486791	Loki, your turn.
1486831	1492138	You're the most new school, and this is kind of sad, because I know you've been playing DDR at least a year, so that doesn't make you that new school.
1492158	1493319	It's actually been like two years.
1493440	1493840	Oh, wow.
1494421	1496484	It started, I think it was, let's see.
1499367	1500127	I saw you there.
1500307	1502448	I knew I saw you in front of me.
1502608	1503708	I was dressed up as Emmy.
1503728	1504449	How would I remember?
1504469	1504769	I don't know.
1504789	1505769	He was drunk.
1527445	1528445	He was trying to get hookers.
1529026	1530186	I've been trying to get hookers.
1530566	1530886	Anyway.
1531507	1536368	Well, if you tuned into last week or the week before that, you would have already known that that's happened.
1536488	1538029	I mean, sorta.
1538069	1539769	No, he was chasing the Jiggly slut around.
1540510	1541110	Jiggly slut?
1541130	1542370	The Jigglypuff cosplay girl.
1542410	1543091	No, they...
1544955	1553463	No, I remember, well, no, last year, last year we were chasing around a bunch of women with cameras, but, uh, no.
1553683	1561090	Anyways, so I saw a DDR4th mix there, and then I got to try a USA Machine in Tahoe and had no rhythm whatsoever, so that was fun.
1561871	1563473	And, um, so then I went and
1564473	1573079	I guess I found out that it was at, you know, Sunsplash, or RPGL, and so I went and played down there, you know, ever since the other fourth in their USA machine.
1573099	1575300	I, you know, bought the home versions and that kind of thing.
1575641	1584606	And then ever since that, because I used to be really into Cusar, and, you know, the laser tech place up here, and I played it for like four years and was really obsessed with it.
1585007	1587368	Well, then that went away, and so now...
1589289	1607759	Now I guess I'm just new in the DDR, and how I know a lot of stuff about Bomani is that at my work, during phone calls and stuff, I'm actually browsing the Bomani news sites out there, and that's how I know pretty much everything that goes on, because I read about, I'd say about 12 different message boards all day long.
1609784	1612325	Right on, so that's the answer to that question.
1612345	1616608	Boy, that was a long question, that was a long answer, but hey, we've got a lot to say here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1616628	1621550	If you're just joining us, as I know some people have just joined us, we are answering email right now.
1621970	1627013	If you have a question, a comment, something you'd like to say, we will read it in our mailbag segment.
1627033	1631495	Just send us an email, orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.
1631916	1636138	And we're reading an email from Martin right now, and he asked a bunch of questions, so we're answering them right now.
1636918	1639902	Question number five, is it only me or do the Zippers suck?
1641043	1646169	The Zippers, by the way, being that band that JB brought in last night, or I'm sorry, last week with the CD.
1648976	1650577	I'm not a huge fan of the Zippers.
1650797	1653339	In fact, I don't like them pretty much at all.
1653639	1658241	But, yeah, they kind of suck if you don't like that speed type music thing.
1658261	1663664	I don't know, that's kind of a trend that DDR has, you know, putting a lot of speed mixes and Euro mixes, stuff, stuff.
1663945	1668487	If you're just not into it, I guess then you wouldn't like it, but, you know, it's something for someone, I'm sure.
1669288	1669628	Like JV.
1671416	1672998	They definitely need to flush that song
1686738	1688459	So, your opinion of the zippers, Jamie?
1690979	1693120	Our apologies to JB, and we hope you still love us.
1693260	1696741	Alright, Waka Laka School.
1697041	1698502	Next question.
1698762	1701843	How come everyone I know suddenly has the weasel, a.k.a.
1701903	1704944	Bush Baby?
1705664	1706224	Bush Baby...
1707419	1708860	Our second Orange Lounge mascot.
1708880	1710281	Our first Orange Lounge mascot would be Dave.
1710601	1712663	But our second Orange Lounge mascot would be the weasel.
1714044	1715765	It was given to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.
1716705	1717266	Simple as that.
1717466	1718467	And it sits here.
1718507	1721729	I have a lot of little thingies that sit above the computer.
1721929	1722990	There's a Clifford ball.
1723050	1727693	There's a devil I got from that same convention where I saw DDR the first time.
1727733	1728653	A couple Bats Maru.
1728673	1729374	A bunch of stickers.
1729714	1730274	Cartman doll.
1730615	1731075	Things like that.
1731135	1735318	The ferret was just sitting up there and Jamie grabbed it one night and just went to town.
1735418	1736358	So you hear it right now.
1738440	1741261	So, that's the story behind the weasel.
1741741	1745943	And if everyone you know has the weasel, I don't know your friends, so I don't know why.
1746283	1747223	Is the weasel a ferret?
1747303	1748084	It's a thingy.
1748784	1749344	Next question.
1749464	1752426	How did you find out about DDR top hits or mishits?
1753066	1755527	I signed on to Sackbay Money one day and there it was.
1756007	1756367	The end.
1756627	1758088	Loki told me, so I'll let him tell him.
1759365	1760846	It was actually Aaron in Japan.
1760967	1762428	They were on their message boards.
1762488	1768212	They were doing a kind of like Demonte knockoffs and spinoffs and that kind of thing.
1768232	1771455	And that happened to be the first one they were talking about was DJR Top Hits.
1772215	1773576	Same group did another one.
1773596	1776419	They did a solo upgrade to Fifth Mix.
1776539	1780021	So it's the same people that did that one, did this one.
1781863	1784285	So yeah, AaronInJapan.com.
1784345	1785366	Very fine website.
1785386	1785966	We like them.
1786046	1786947	So go visit them.
1788709	1791210	Next question, did I get your email address right?
1791250	1793011	Well, of course you did, because we're reading your email right now.
1793071	1797713	It is OrangeLoungeRadio, all in a word, at Yahoo.com, and says, Loki, email me back if you did.
1798233	1802395	So I'll forward this email to Loki, and you two can talk about whatever you guys need to talk about.
1802435	1802755	I don't know.
1805356	1806976	Oh, maybe he wants a date.
1808137	1808557	We'll see.
1809571	1811272	All right, so thanks so much for the email, Marvin.
1811292	1811852	We appreciate it.
1811932	1813833	And I think he just joined the chat room.
1813873	1817315	I see a new name here that matches the one on the email, so who knows?
1818476	1819876	Oh, we just got one more new message.
1820457	1821037	Let's have a look.
1821397	1823958	Oh, we got an email from Black Lab.
1824018	1825059	Oh, it's his FUs of the week.
1825079	1826179	Well, we've got to save those for later.
1826640	1826900	Never mind.
1826920	1827540	We'll read those later.
1827860	1828761	Those are the FUs of the week.
1829501	1836204	I was going to try to make it out there, but I don't know how possible it is with my work.
1850470	1851430	Yeah, it's a little ways to go.
1852190	1854211	Oh, he says, he says, yes, it is him.
1854571	1861132	And also, another early happy birthday wish to one of our, we have a new school listener and a very, very old school listener.
1861412	1863373	Been here with us, I believe, since the first show.
1863793	1864653	Did our website.
1864893	1866493	SoCal Kicks is having a birthday tomorrow.
1866874	1868634	So, happy birthday to him.
1868794	1869154	Squeak.
1870554	1871475	Oh, I can turn off the music now.
1871495	1872295	We're done with the mailbag.
1873995	1875795	So, a big happy birthday.
1875815	1877896	Yeah, because I have the sound off in the studio to try to get rid of that hum.
1879973	1880314	I don't know.
1880734	1881135	We'll see.
1882796	1889203	So, speaking of SoCalKicks, I believe I can talk about this now.
1889444	1889784	I don't know.
1889844	1890224	We're going to see.
1890244	1891386	I'm going to plug some websites.
1891886	1897232	We're going to do some website hunting right now because a couple of websites have just launched.
1897492	1898033	Crikey!
1898494	1899455	There's one right now.
1901886	1906231	A couple new Bimani websites have launched, and we're going to check them out right here, live on air.
1906291	1911696	First one, SoCalKicks.com did launch 5.0, I believe it is.
1912477	1924210	Oh, and this is the one where we were making fun of his tagline a couple weeks ago, because he has this tagline that says, SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now, but now it's just later, or just now, just this second.
1924930	1926090	Okay, um, Rob.
1926170	1926630	Yes, Dave.
1926650	1927691	I just got back from the other room.
1928191	1929511	Dude, that game looks so boring.
1929531	1935252	I don't know if there's some underlying secret mind control device, but it's like, okay.
1935272	1935432	Yes.
1935452	1936933	You talking about Animal Crossing?
1936953	1937133	Yeah.
1937273	1937473	Yes.
1937833	1938653	It's addicting as hell.
1938793	1941133	It's like, okay, I think I'll go change the music now.
1941413	1944514	Did they show you the old school Nintendo games that you can play?
1944874	1945054	No.
1945134	1947195	Tell them to go to my house and play the old school Nintendo games.
1947215	1947675	It's awesome.
1947775	1948315	Okay, I will.
1950083	1951403	Jameel, want to comment on Animal Crossing?
1951423	1952524	No, I was just saying yes.
1952784	1953104	Oh, okay.
1954264	1955784	Oh, yes, back to SoCalKicks.com.
1957505	1958225	Blah, blah, blah.
1958285	1961885	Welcome back to STK Max Ultimate Evolution just now.
1961925	1965726	About time after a three-week wait and constant launch dates being flushed right down the drain.
1965766	1966746	Finally, the site relaunches.
1967106	1971487	Just in time for SoCalKicks' birthday.
1972007	1972167	Aw.
1972287	1973088	Happy birthday.
1974128	1975728	He's got a lot of people on board.
1976048	1979069	Going to be doing the website stuff and none of us are on it.
1980632	1982474	Thank you for watching!
2002649	2006653	Let's see, so what's so big about STK Max 5.0 that makes it better than the other versions?
2006713	2008554	It says, well many things actually.
2008614	2010556	For the first time, they have forums.
2011017	2012018	They're going to have some forums.
2012218	2012758	Pretty nice.
2014260	2015241	Or I can read.
2016302	2021387	And let's see, and they're going to be talking about all Bomani and it's not just going to be whoring out Konami of America stuff.
2022007	2024150	It's going to be all DDR, so that'll be cool.
2025491	2031395	and let's see, they're going to do pad reviews, mod facts, blah blah blah, check it out for yourself, SoCalKicks.com.
2031435	2033736	Let's see, let's see what these forums look like, I'm very curious.
2034577	2035197	More forums.
2035798	2037859	Oh, it's the generic layout for the forums, well that's okay.
2037939	2039460	He says they're going to update that soon, so.
2040281	2041842	Ooh, I should register now, huh?
2041882	2045765	So I can get in there and register right now, so I'll be like one of the first few members.
2046445	2048827	Let's see, blah blah blah, I'm going to register for this new board.
2050248	2050869	You do that.
2051449	2052570	I'm going to go get a taco.
2053166	2054188	You're going to go get a taco?
2055269	2059836	Alright, we're going to peruse another website.
2060417	2062900	We're going to peruse another website while I sign up for those forums.
2064725	2064965	and Benso.
2064985	2065265	See ya.
2185896	2187258	Thank you for watching

2326006	2328867	So, we will be taped next week.
2329207	2333530	But if you want to hear it live, we'll be doing the normal shtick just on Saturday night as opposed to Sunday.
2334330	2340153	So, outside of that, oh yes, we're going to be also doing a mini marathon next week.
2340743	2346444	So if you want to catch up on some old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to be marathoning all of Season 1 next weekend.
2347044	2347404	All of it.
2347945	2348825	So tune in for that.
2350125	2352886	Actually, this is something that you and I have discussed, and I forgot to mention it.
2352926	2354186	Yes, that's fine.
2354946	2358847	I told you before about a friend of mine who's doing a radio drama.
2358987	2360727	Yes, talk about this.
2360807	2362188	Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
2363208	2368169	One is actually based on I Feel Sick, which was Debbie's spinoff.
2369393	2370954	and I'm going to be a voice actor in it.
2371614	2372714	I'm going to be Oblivia.
2374235	2376816	And we still need one more voice actor for this.
2377076	2384899	My friend Michelle is very talented doing a very good adaptation of the comic, so we need one more voice actor.
2384919	2391181	So if anyone's interested, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.
2391681	2392381	I'm interested.
2392741	2394242	Can you sound like a whiny gothy boy?
2395419	2396800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2422581	2424102	DarkSakura.com
2443327	2446428	Brand new, I'm not sure if this is going to be a blog or what it is.
2446448	2452191	I believe it's a blog, but I'm being asked to hoard out by a chat regular of ours, DCB.
2452251	2453311	He's a good buddy of the show.
2453371	2458073	He's going to be doing a tournament in Fremont, a DDR tourney in Fremont in January.
2458593	2462875	Check the DDR Freak Tournament forums if you want more information on that.
2463375	2464676	A Fremont tournament in January.
2465276	2467217	And he's got this website called Killer Pals.
2468433	2468914	Super Friends
2483721	2484482	www.radbeats.com
2507708	2508569	It's orange and blue
2524989	2526010	Lissy, do they have a forum?
2526450	2527411	No, the forum link doesn't work.
2527431	2528232	How about links?
2528772	2530573	We have not been added to the links page yet.
2531634	2533315	Grr, hang thy head in shame.
2534196	2535617	That's alright, we'll forgive them this once.
2535657	2537098	And the members page doesn't work.
2538599	2542362	So obviously this page is under construction, but it's something you should keep an eye on.
2542623	2543283	It's pretty.
2544064	2544964	Because they're neat.
2547395	2549377	I only know about half these people, but they're all neat.
2550477	2551598	The half I do know are neat.
2551698	2554040	They're very well taken care of and clean.
2554620	2555481	They have good hygiene.
2555581	2559064	So visit the killer pals, because Bongo demands it.
2559584	2559884	Yeah.
2560124	2560585	Let's see.
2560825	2562806	Oh, 23rd Magus has a comment for you, Jamie.
2562867	2565328	He says he could sound like a whiny goth boy, because he is.
2567570	2568070	We'll see.
2568130	2568551	We'll see.
2570097	2578264	Do samples of your voice, try to sound, you know, do different types of voices and say different things and email me that.
2579004	2581546	Meet me later on AIM and I'll get that from you.
2582207	2585310	Now they're having an argument in the chat room about tilde versus tilde.
2586751	2587531	Squiggly thing.
2587992	2589393	Squiggly thing, exactly.
2589693	2592696	Just go to dictionary.com and look up the word.
2592856	2594097	All hail the squiggly thing.
2595248	2600072	And we'll have a pronunciation key there so you don't have to actually go into a dictionary or feel it.
2600893	2604075	Okay, so that's our website tour for the week.
2604235	2607979	I don't know, is there any other website news that you know of?
2608159	2608819	Things going on?
2609139	2612582	Loki, any big websites that have been renovated?
2612602	2613203	Mergers?
2613983	2614464	Buyouts?
2614544	2615064	Sellouts?
2617026	2627453	Other than the couple week old 2DX style going down, I guess they're doing more to the Monty style to kind of incorporate the junk that they were covering with 2DXstyle.com on there.
2627613	2629474	So that will probably be going on.
2629914	2636459	There's another site that's coming up at some point, DDRextreme.com, and there's going to be some stuff on there.
2636479	2639421	They already have the little page saying coming soon, that kind of thing.
2640281	2645645	Aside from that, oh, Dance Dance Evolution's down now for good.
2646325	2648126	Let me make one quick interruption.
2648166	2650907	Michelle, I see you, and yes I did whore out the show.
2650927	2652368	We are going to have that last voice actor.
2676354	2678036	LeechTrumLokiTK will soon be hosting
2697222	2722169	Some Sky Original Step Mania files They will be scary indeed, so keep an eye out for them I've gotten into the sim I also have to mention that I did change my Tourney Mix 3 song And you'll be hearing that later on in the show Yes, we'll be doing that in the cage match later Cage match is coming up I'm so glad we have a crowded chat room tonight That makes me a happy bunny Oh, hello Elena Oh yes, I wanted to get to this You have to go soon, huh?
2722529	2725890	Oh well, I wanted to talk to Elena Everybody say hello to Elena Hello
2727526	2727586	D.D.R.
2754831	2756861	and I was still a nerd back then though too, right?
2758007	2770294	What I want to talk to you about is, because I like to bring strangers on the show occasionally that know nothing about DDR, just ask you, what do you think when you see this for the first time, this DDR fanatic fan club?
2771294	2772675	Are we crazy, or what is it?
2772795	2774336	No, frankly, you scare me.
2774356	2774816	We scare you?
2774856	2775557	How do we scare you?
2775737	2776237	Oh, I don't know.
2776297	2779619	It's just all the dancing and all the weird things you guys do.
2780159	2781000	All the weird things?
2781060	2781460	Like what?
2781520	2782981	Hand plants and bar raping?
2783041	2784101	Yeah, and you know what?
2784262	2784942	You know what?
2787018	2790880	I see some of the stuff that you guys, the dance moves and stuff.
2790940	2791501	It's kind of weird.
2791521	2792261	It's kind of different.
2792301	2793963	It's weird in a good way, I should say.
2797535	2803900	Now, but what I did want to talk to Elena about is that she just discovered the world of PlayStation 2, what, two weeks ago?
2804181	2805442	How did this happen?
2805942	2815510	Actually, my roommate's boyfriend, Mike, brought over a PlayStation, and this is really a big upgrade for us over at my roommate's and my house.
2815910	2819493	We have the original Atari, and we have been playing it, actually.
2819513	2820214	Word.
2820234	2820814	The original.
2821115	2822756	We play Space Invaders and all the fun stuff.
2823116	2824277	I wanted to ask you about Atari 2600.
2824337	2828158	Because you've been playing Atari 2600 up until two weeks ago.
2828439	2830620	It was all about fucking Atari.
2830700	2831180	It was great.
2831540	2834881	What is the best Atari 2600 game you've ever played in your whole life?
2835042	2835622	Space Invaders.
2835722	2836342	Space Invaders?
2836422	2836802	I love it.
2837002	2837543	I disagree.
2838263	2838763	I disagree.
2838923	2839363	Breakout.
2839463	2840184	That's because you're a bastard.
2840224	2840564	No, no.
2841004	2841384	Kaboom.
2841805	2842205	Kaboom.
2842565	2843705	Kaboom is the best.
2844066	2844586	Kangaroo.
2845166	2846527	No, I didn't like Kangaroo at all.
2846547	2847107	But you know what?
2847227	2849368	I have a 5200 and it's all about kicks.
2849948	2851309	See, we can't even get that game.
2852398	2856182	It's all about a large group of drunk people playing combat.
2856963	2857503	No.
2858084	2863490	Okay, I'm being yelled at in the chat room because Atari 2600 is not the original Atari.
2864931	2867174	It's the only Atari that matters, so shove it.
2868217	2873898	There was the Pong system, and there was some other one that was like a maze one.
2874198	2883880	Yeah, but this is... Yeah, but as far as conventional systems go, the Atari 2600 is probably the granddaddy, unless you count the Fairchild Channel F that came out before it.
2886120	2887100	You don't even play Game Boy?
2887620	2889641	No, actually, I haven't ever played Game Boy.
2889661	2890981	You haven't ever played Game Boy.
2891581	2894001	So, you just don't think you can get into the DDR?
2894281	2897222	Did you see the turntable game, the 2DX, the turntable game with the buttons?
2897522	2897562	No.
2898021	2899104	No.
2899385	2900948	Is it just intimidating?
2900988	2903274	What frightens you about DDR?
2909026	2912789	Oh, I see, you don't got no time for DDR.
2913129	2916372	Busy Elena, she got time to be doing the Space Invaders.
2917212	2918894	But heaven forbid you ask her to dance a little.
2919094	2921556	Now, Space Invaders is an awfully good drunk party game.
2921956	2923877	Well, so is DDR.
2925338	2927720	You've been to the house parties, you know.
2927900	2929802	I can play 2DX drunk and do pretty good.
2931633	2932474	But you know what?
2932514	2936076	It's not only just DDR that is a little strange.
2936096	2938417	I came to a party that you were at.
2938677	2938917	Yes.
2938937	2939798	You guys were playing...
2941383	2942484	Yes, Parapara.
2943044	2946445	Oh, Parapara scares even us, so it's okay.
2947006	2949047	Oh, we got Ryan to wear Ina's clothing.
2949287	2951148	That was great.
2951168	2957111	We got one of our friends, Ryan, SDMX, he actually wore his girlfriend's clothes to play Parapara.
2957371	2961313	Pictures were taken of this and put on other websites, yes.
2962373	2963093	That's insane.
2963394	2965174	That was an insane party.
2965335	2966135	Did we get you to play that?
2966435	2967796	How is Parapara frightening to you?
2967876	2968336	I wasn't drunk.
2969525	2970946	How is Parapara frightening?
2970986	2971606	I want to know.
2971746	2977048	Well, first of all, it's not in English.
2977148	2980029	Actually, most of the songs are in English and all the text in the game is too.
2980309	2981750	Not the one that you guys had on that night.
2981790	2983230	The Macarena's in Spanish.
2984131	2985531	Everybody knows the Macarena.
2986492	2987152	Yes, gutter.
2992000	2999502	Well, the scary thing I think about Pot of Potta is that when you watch the people who know the dances, and then you have five people behind them who all know the dances too.
3000083	3001863	Was that going on when you were here?
3002043	3007385	That we were all going, boom, boom, deluxe, da, da, da, da, da, da, shake my ass, shake my ass.
3007825	3009127	It was a whole room of people.
3009227	3011590	It was very, very... I can totally understand.
3011650	3022223	At the MGL Tournament 2, I think it was, when they were having that go on, people around the Parapara second mix, I was just walking the room and all of a sudden you see 30 people doing it.
3022643	3023264	Holy crap!
3023564	3024085	Zombies!
3024566	3024886	Run!
3025427	3026628	It's still all over again!
3027449	3032135	You know the sad thing about it in Japan and Hawaii and basically all over the area?
3032536	3035460	The pata pata dance, there's whole clubs of people who do this.
3036000	3040286	And everybody dresses the same because, you know, it's easier to do pata pata when you have no sleeves and everything.
3040908	3045710	Wait a minute, because knowing Elena, I know something about Elena that y'all don't know, so I'm coming in armed.
3046611	3050032	Elena, don't you do country line dancing?
3050452	3052633	Oh, no, not since there hasn't been a club in Sacramento.
3052653	3053694	Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3054414	3058296	How is country line dancing different than para-para, except the music in para-para is better?
3061237	3064899	Well, you know what, I never country line dance without some alcohol in me, so no.
3065719	3067180	The other thing about pata-pata is just...
3069241	3070042	Say hello to Neil.
3070222	3072365	That's because with country line dancing, you're not doing it alone.
3072385	3072485	Yes.
3072845	3074607	You're not looking like a single fool.
3074928	3078312	And you don't have idiot shadowing behind you.
3078432	3081696	At actual pata pata clubs, they have everybody doing the same thing with you.
3081756	3083478	So everybody looks like they're all in a pack.
3084319	3087423	So if I took you to a para para club, do you think you'd get down and boogie?
3087623	3089065	You know what, I probably could handle the dances.
3089105	3089445	I don't think.
3094864	3095804	No offense, you know, I love you.
3095824	3098226	That was the best thing I've heard all night.
3098306	3099706	That's so owned.
3101447	3102728	You get winner points today.
3104408	3105969	Alaina gets escorted off the show now.
3106009	3107050	Thank you for being with us tonight.
3107070	3107830	We appreciate it.
3107910	3108410	Big hugs.
3108991	3109651	Take care.
3110151	3111232	Enjoy Gran Turismo.
3111332	3113072	This is your new addiction, Gran Turismo.
3113653	3114533	It's on top, man.
3114553	3114533	227.9.
3114573	3115594	What car are you using?
3120595	3121035	are something.
3121396	3121736	You know what?
3121756	3123857	We're going to take you to play Initial D someday.
3123957	3130061	Yes, we must take you to play Initial D. You will love Initial D. This is the only game I have played on these new PlayStations.
3130081	3132602	I have to learn one before I move on to the next.
3132622	3134103	You're going to graduate to Initial D next week.
3134403	3136384	And then maybe some Grand Theft Auto after that.
3136404	3136905	We'll see.
3136965	3137305	Alright.
3137965	3138566	Take care, Elena.
3138966	3139706	Big hand for Elena.
3139726	3140267	Yay.
3140307	3141427	I still need to get Vice City.
3141447	3142248	And Neil was in there too.
3142948	3145990	I still need to get Vice City so that I can go around and kill people.
3146010	3147351	You can get hookers to sleep with you.
3147671	3148591	I don't want a hooker.
3150272	3154013	See, the thing is, they don't have, you know, like, man sluts out on the street in that game.
3154033	3155713	They need to have man sluts.
3155733	3161275	There needs to be... Okay, you know, they just put out Tokimeki Memorial Girlside, where you can, you know, date the boys.
3162075	3167517	I want to have GTA Chick version, where you can go pick up the man sluts off the streets.
3169426	3175929	and go on this female crusade, you know, beating wife beaters and everything and setting houses on fire.
3176149	3177430	And, like, watching Oprah.
3180231	3183092	You can, like, have the militant female mission and everything.
3183552	3184653	Ooh, I'm hungry.
3184853	3186454	Ooh, here's some bonbons on the ground.
3186494	3188414	Mmm, yum, yum, yum.
3188935	3190856	Oh, shit, I gotta get the car over to Mervin's.
3190876	3191696	They're having a sale.
3191776	3192876	Open, open, open, open.
3193417	3194517	No, no, no, no, no.
3195177	3195638	Not like that.
3195718	3196438	I'm just kidding.
3197179	3197920	Thanks for watching!
3213243	3214785	I think we're going to take a really quick break.
3236568	3240429	In the chat room to Sky, that's me, and they'll have your FUs of the week.
3240469	3243970	So send those now, and we'll read those on the air when we come back.
3243990	3246311	Let us know what has you really hacked off.
3246571	3250992	Or, if you're too lazy, you don't want to join our chat room, you want a little bit of anonymity, that's fine.
3251372	3254293	You can send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
3254333	3256754	And if you say, don't say my name on the air, we won't.
3256854	3258474	So you can do your anonymous FUs.
3258914	3259294	Fair enough.
3259594	3260595	You can be a win.
3260635	3262975	Jamie, would you like to dedicate this first song during the break?
3263175	3265196	I dedicate this song to me because I love it.
3265476	3266197	Alright, here we go.
3266217	3283130	I'm lost inside of me Trapped in emotion Where am I going to?

3612805	3618766	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
3619126	3620987	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

3627293	3632916	Hey, it's our buddy Mel B there, saying hello to all of us and all of you listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3633177	3634678	We've got to have him back on the show sometime.
3635178	3637419	He can pull off that tone very well.
3637599	3638560	Yes, he's very smooth.
3638860	3639821	Yeah, he's very smooth.
3640421	3640681	Yes.
3642022	3647785	Okay, so as promised, it's time to talk about the FUs of the week.
3647805	3649466	We can be pissy.
3650327	3653109	Jamie, why don't you give us a little background on the FUs of the week.
3653369	3654970	This is 22 weeks running now.
3655670	3657191	No longer than that, about 24 weeks.
3657211	3659091	It started with our very first show.
3659332	3659552	Yes.
3659572	3663893	Because I was feeling particularly angsty one day and wanted to just vent, vent, vent, vent.
3664334	3665234	Well, guess what?
3665254	3666154	You all get to hear it.
3666574	3672017	Well, anyway, the whole thing with having the FU's of the week is basically it is our time to vent.
3672377	3673897	These are the things that aggravate us.
3673997	3674538	We're people.
3674558	3675158	We're human.
3675778	3679139	We need to get this out of our system or we'll go crazy and we'll take you with us.
3679820	3680120	Anyway.
3681401	3686825	So that's what the FUs of the week are for, and eventually the chatroom got as angsty as we did, so we let them in on the fun too.
3687005	3689407	And you still can sit in on the fun.
3689707	3692789	If you want to send us your FUs of the week, you just send those over a private message and we'll take care of it.
3693009	3696012	See, even the stupid ferret has an FU of the week.
3697433	3697673	See?
3700095	3702296	Are you ready to begin with your FU of the week, Jamie?
3702356	3702937	Please do.
3703097	3703958	Let's kick it off.
3704258	3705319	Because this is fucked up.
3706770	3707150	Alright.
3707470	3710811	My FU of the week, I have a few, as usual.
3711431	3715372	Um, you know, the last few weeks have been a little bit happier, haven't had so much to bitch about.
3716293	3718473	I would like to say fuck you to Ragnarok Online.
3719734	3721314	This is why, okay?
3722134	3731497	I've been sitting there for three months waiting for the server to come back up so that I could get my character back in my lovely little goggles and be happy, and they're making us pay for it.
3732205	3733906	Well, that in and of itself is fine.
3733946	3735366	You know, $10 for two months.
3735626	3740288	That's not that bad, except the thing is that they haven't been letting people in with the server.
3740748	3744089	Well, thank God I didn't pay, because I don't want them to have my credit card number.
3744389	3745169	So, fuck them.
3745209	3747550	I'll play the Japanese one, which is opening up tomorrow.
3748891	3752752	And, my next fucking week goes for, um...
3756346	3760470	Well, you know, it goes for the fact that I don't have anyone to play Phantasy Star Online with.
3761030	3761571	I'm trying.
3761671	3762291	I'll be there soon.
3762311	3763512	We need people.
3763753	3771640	If anybody has Phantasy Star Online and managed to get their hands on a GameCube, you know, broadband adapter, stay with me, please.
3771700	3774002	I don't want to play PSO by myself.
3774042	3774983	Stay with me.
3775503	3776844	Would you like to play a game?
3778005	3778065	Um...
3779349	3784630	and other fucking salutes go toward my really awesome fans, my ones with a fire on them.
3785251	3787591	They're tearing up already, and I've had the shoes barely for months.
3787711	3788551	I love those shoes.
3788571	3791932	I've got those shoes full, and they're tearing up, so piss me off.
3792032	3798154	Okay, um, in the next episode... This is one of the stupid people I have to drive to work with.
3798214	3798914	Oh my god.
3799314	3805516	Sacramento's full of the most stupid fucking people in the world because they can't drive.
3806750	3810372	SoCalKicks would like to share that he asked for Phantasy Star Online for his birthday.
3810392	3812472	Good luck getting the broadband adapter.
3812512	3812893	Okay, get this.
3832065	3835858	Nintendo puts out the broadband adapter for the GameCube.
3835938	3836581	And Nintendo.
3836781	3838005	And then recalls the thing.
3839578	3848644	I don't know if it was recalled or just if they stopped, you know, making them, but why put out a big multiplayer game and then stop making the adapter?
3848664	3849604	That's just retarded.
3849985	3857329	Well, anyway, I've got mine because, you know, my fiancé being the manager of GameStop, he can pull those little strings and things like that.
3857349	3861312	But, um, in the meantime, you know, I'm gaming by myself.
3861812	3865295	And also, if I go to Animal Crossing, because I really want to start playing Kingdom Hearts again.
3865315	3868057	Every time I play Kingdom Hearts, that wave bird just stares at me.
3869357	3871579	You want to check on your village.
3872459	3874581	You want to check on your village.
3875221	3877423	You want to go by the looking way.
3877903	3880284	You still have $300,000 to pay off on your own.
3880324	3884467	Alright, let's hear from Loki, Refuse of the Week.
3884487	3886168	First, if he has to go to eBay...
3899702	3902084	because, um, for a few reasons, actually.
3902444	3908969	One, this annoying new ad campaign that they have going where it's like Broadway singers singing like stupid crap about eBay.
3909649	3911330	I really don't want to hear about eBay.
3911730	3915453	eBay's stupid, with all these people that bid last minute on stuff.
3916113	3921837	I was winning the two bids on my, you know, hair-to-hair crap and my places too, and I definitely won.
3922378	3928122	And, yeah, like, one second left, you know, people bid up, you know, on it going over the price of it.
3929298	3934881	However, I got one of the fucking bastards back because he bid up on, what was it, my PlayStation 2?
3935322	3937883	So I bid up another $30 on it just to piss him off.
3938624	3940005	That was cool.
3940185	3940545	Amen.
3941261	3946582	And so you ended up paying like a good $40 over of what they were both worth, so that's a good thing.
3946602	3947562	Okay, you can have them.
3947742	3948522	So that's that.
3948942	3952283	And, uh, yeah, I don't know, I just hate eBay because it sucks.
3952343	3953963	They don't have anything good on there.
3954103	3957224	And, you know, I found, you know, a few caramels.
3957264	3957624	And, uh, oh.
3957704	3961905	I'll tell you what, my plan is to have an outlet store where they don't need your machines.
3969884	3974187	If you want a machine to try out your little project on, I will volunteer mine.
3991710	3992330	The Holidays.
3993511	3997333	And it's not because, you know, I'm like a Scrooge or, you know, I hate that kind of thing.
3997493	4001316	I just hate, you know, I hate the whole, like, constantly playing Christmas music.
4001376	4004718	I mean, they have, like, four songs that they just play over and over.
4004778	4005658	It's really annoying.
4006098	4012602	I hate, you know, these stupid Christmas sales and people dressed up like, you know, they're cold or something.
4012722	4013983	I hate this shit.
4014063	4014703	It's annoying.
4015924	4017645	People are so stupid around the holidays.
4018346	4018466	And...
4019606	4020787	Thanks for watching!
4037429	4047775	I mean, I'm sure back in tradition, you had candles up on the Christmas tree, but I don't think it ever wanted to progress to the point where, I have a giant plastic snowman in my front lawn!
4047915	4048496	Yay!
4048756	4053859	There's the houses that are tastefully done, with a few white lights here and there, but then there's the houses that Christmas throws up on.
4053919	4055920	Yeah, but not when you live in Ghettoville.
4056160	4058541	Ghettoville doesn't have those tastefully done houses.
4058822	4062564	They have, oh look, there's a giant American flag going across the whole court.
4062784	4063524	Ooh, fun!
4064805	4067588	And then we're just going to randomly throw up lights on our house.
4067728	4069510	Yeah, I don't know.
4069530	4071872	I hate that part of Christmas and holidays.
4072172	4074334	I hate the commercialization of holidays.
4074955	4078638	It sucks.
4078758	4080239	I don't really have anything sweet.
4080440	4087006	I've been kind of tired, so... I would like to escape on this little holiday special.
4087046	4087526	Go for it.
4089139	4097263	Okay, everybody knows that I am very tolerant toward other religions and people's beliefs, but I really hate being preached to at Christmas time, okay?
4098924	4101886	I hate when people come to me, you're gonna go to hell if you don't believe this.
4102566	4103207	It's Christmas.
4103767	4105408	Those damn people and their Kwanzaa.
4107169	4107449	Okay.
4108149	4109990	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
4110010	4110891	Celebrate what you want.
4112009	4115692	All these Christmas pageants and everything, and they have it snowing and crap.
4116192	4128961	First of all, if you want to go historically, the time that they would have, you know, and this is coming from knowing lots of theologians and everything, if you want to go historically, when Jesus was born, okay, they were doing a census.
4129061	4133024	Is it census or census?
4133044	4133884	The plural of census, okay.
4134244	4139168	Anyway, a census would have been done coming up into the spring season.
4139867	4142190	So therefore, they first of all got Susan wrong.
4142210	4145813	The reason why Christmas is in the wintertime is because of the pagan holiday!
4146134	4146594	Hello?
4146815	4147135	Yule?
4147455	4147816	You know?
4148376	4149037	Go get it.
4149377	4150298	You know the whole Christmas tree?
4150458	4151059	It's pagan!
4152340	4154883	Jesus did not have a Christmas tree at his manger.
4155544	4155904	Okay?
4156865	4157626	How do you know?
4157786	4158447	Were you there?
4158607	4159328	Did you see it?
4160442	4164686	Okay, Douglas firs did not grow in Arabia.
4165067	4165647	Oh yeah, sure.
4165928	4169351	Not under this mystical, like, you know, birthing happening here.
4169671	4172815	No, they just couldn't magically make a Douglas fir appear out of nowhere.
4173475	4175878	Sure, and like, you know, bushes catch on fire every day.
4177019	4177740	Okay, come on.
4177760	4179021	What about Santa Claus?
4181343	4181744	Dammit.
4182224	4182384	Hey.
4182424	4183946	You little Santa people.
4184935	4185575	Just listen here.
4185895	4188556	I did have to say, Santa Claus saved the day in my movie, Feeders 2.
4189196	4194357	He kicked the ass against those aliens, you know, and Santa Claus is really, you know, awesome when he has a ray gun.
4194557	4202659	Remember in Nightmare Before Christmas, Sandy Claus.
4204339	4207160	Well, how can I follow up these?
4207260	4207820	I don't know.
4207940	4210641	I need to start doing my FUs first, because...
4211633	4212073	DarkSakura.com
4236407	4237227	and then He-Man, of course.
4237307	4238408	Anyway, oh yes, my FUs of the week.
4238948	4241668	My first FU of the week would be the Christmas carols as well.
4241788	4243989	I was in Taco Bell the other night listening to Christmas carols.
4245329	4250490	Oh my god, I'm going to be so nauseatingly sick of Deck the Fucking Halls by the time 25th World's Around.
4250510	4251751	Just you wait, just you wait.
4252071	4252791	I hate Christmas carols.
4254291	4258312	My second FU of the week would be to work because I don't want to go back.
4258372	4259932	I've enjoyed this little vacation too much.
4261213	4261873	I don't want to go either.
4263687	4268289	and my third FU of the week goes to Olivia at Animal Crossing because she's bipolar.
4268309	4271030	I need to kill Olivia back in my village.
4271790	4273410	That's rough for taking Olivia away from me.
4273631	4275151	And I guess that's it.
4275171	4278272	Let's talk about the chatroom FUs, shall we?
4278372	4279133	I don't get FUs.
4279293	4280613	I have more.
4280853	4281353	You have more?
4281373	4281693	Seriously?
4281753	4282474	Alright.
4283214	4284734	Let's talk to the chatroom about their FUs.
4284755	4285755	We love you, chatroom.
4285815	4286355	Yes, we do.
4286375	4287776	We do love the chatroom.
4287796	4288736	You're special.
4289356	4289656	Alright.
4293478	4295199	Oh, fuck you for doing Deck the Halls.
4295219	4295659	Deck the Halls.
4318977	4319778	All right, yes, Loki.
4319798	4322679	There's an FU going out to, I can't remember the guy's name.
4322900	4325201	I think it was, I don't remember.
4325241	4331885	Anyway, someone just released a remix of Let Them Move as a sim file, and it reminded me of one of Twen's things.
4331985	4336368	Actually, he said, and I quote, this one's actually worse than the ones I did.
4336908	4339330	So that gets you an idea of how bad this thing is.
4344694	4345695	Back to Twins FUs.
4346795	4349337	FU to half the chat rooms for not ever taking a joke.
4350137	4350718	Okay, whatever.
4350758	4353019	That was funny, ha ha ha.
4353059	4354299	He's got some happy FUs.
4354339	4355540	Who doesn't want to hear happy FUs?
4356581	4356881	No.
4357161	4358422	Take your happy FUs and cram them.
4358442	4359482	Dude, he's at Pensacola.
4359602	4360603	I was like from like near there.
4360623	4360743	Really?
4360763	4360863	Yeah.
4360883	4361063	Right on.
4364154	4365515	His girlfriend is from Pensacola.
4365936	4367777	That's like an hour from where I used to live.
4367957	4373342	Oh, and he's going to miss Orange Lounge to go spend time with a woman.
4373702	4380368	Hey, hey, if you get a benefit from missing the show, you need to spend that time.
4380388	4384691	If you're going to miss this show for some pussy, then I suppose, you know, we can forgive you.
4386973	4388954	Alright, uh, let's see, moving right along.
4389134	4395195	That's a showgirls moment.
4396595	4411979	Stresa says, um, F you to the three days that he's played DDR, he's not that bad at all, and he can do almost any direction on the damn pad, do pretty well, I can pull off light freestyle for four foot, five foot, so I can do pretty darn good.
4412019	4414560	He's not a noob, and F anyone who says he's a noobie.
4414900	4415220	Nope.
4417060	4417780	Just kidding, you're not new.
4417820	4418921	Everybody's got to start somewhere.
4420021	4421642	We all got to start somewhere.
4421762	4425303	DSCS SoCalKick says, FU to PHP Conflictions.
4426343	4427904	He really doesn't have any FUs other than that.
4428604	4430925	So, he's a happy camper outside of that.
4433351	4439496	EOSFBB says Dear Lord, there's a lot.
4439596	4439896	Okay.
4441158	4443239	F you to people who attended Comdex in Vegas.
4443279	4445001	You whores made traffic a nightmare.
4445321	4450785	And F you to all the exhibitors especially because it went for the free stuff and he left disappointed.
4450846	4451666	Comdex sucks.
4452227	4453908	F you to whoever thought of Thanksgiving.
4454328	4456951	Now I got a fridge full of leftovers and I'm already sick of turkey.
4457271	4460614	It's all about the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving because pizza is still good the next day.
4461374	4461654	Amen.
4464196	4466177	Time for the plugs, since everybody else got a plug.
4466217	4472942	Mostly websites, but while in Vegas, be sure to visit VidPower's restaurant, Cheerful Chinese Cuisine, in sunny Las Vegas.
4473342	4478265	Open six days a week, Tuesday through Sunday, at 1223 East Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada.
4478385	4479285	Call for takeout.
4480726	4481647	Oh, shit.
4482868	4485729	Wait, we don't want the address broadcast.
4485769	4486550	I just read it.
4489232	4489772	My bad.
4490652	4491233	You'll get business.
4494874	4497697	You need to say it first, then I won't say it.
4499900	4500901	I just read in order.
4500921	4502743	I read from top to bottom, top to bottom.
4504545	4505847	I think I'm done with his FUs now.
4505887	4507889	Let's go to next FUs.
4507909	4510392	The next set of FUs comes from 23rd Magus.
4512478	4515280	I have a big FU to Chatroom Drama because it's there.
4515440	4519123	A medium-sized FU to Matsuri Japan Maniac for throwing off my groove.
4519243	4527029	And a bite-sized FU, I like that, a bite-sized FU to Battle.net for screwing up every time he connects.
4527070	4529652	And also a fuck me to any available ladies.
4529972	4530672	Whoa, hello.
4532053	4533113	Whoa!
4533153	4534334	Whoa, this isn't hot or not.
4535534	4536514	Whoa!
4537334	4537915	That's right.
4538195	4539715	No selling meat here on Orange Lounge.
4540155	4542656	And one last FU to the Skrull system.
4542716	4543596	I need no explanation.
4543636	4544796	I want all their balls to die.
4545997	4546897	I think we need shirts.
4547177	4549757	I think we need shirts that say that.
4549878	4551078	I want all your balls to die.
4551098	4553198	Should we ask the person who made that shockwave thing?
4553438	4554159	Is there a shockwave?
4554179	4555319	I didn't realize there was a shockwave.
4555379	4555779	Oh, my bad.
4555939	4559620	It's a really bad version of the Romeo and Juliette.
4560746	4564209	But there's an even better one, though, that was Harry Potter.
4564229	4565230	With the Draco dance.
4565530	4575657	Anyway, VidPower says, FU of the week goes to germs, once again, because my voice is all harsh and scraggly, and whenever I cough, my body feels like crap.
4576278	4578359	And FU to stupid, mean bowling attendants.
4579160	4579440	I agree.
4579460	4580481	Yeah, fuck them.
4580501	4580881	Fuck them.
4581602	4586886	Brack2000 says, FU to Nori Nori Nori, and that one's for 23 Megas.
4587906	4589668	He's doing an FU on behalf of somebody else.
4593066	4593807	Yes.
4593827	4598633	DDR Angel says, Hello, I made our window disappear.
4598654	4599174	Here it is again.
4599675	4604081	F you to stomp to my beat, because it hates Stresa and I, and it won't let us pass it.
4604702	4606865	That F you was from Stresa and DDR Angel.
4607586	4608487	Well, keep working at it.
4608507	4609047	What can we say?
4609127	4613529	If you're playing the Maniac, the fourth plus steps are pretty hard, too, from what I remember.
4614009	4618492	So, I don't remember which version's on Max USA, but keep working at it.
4618532	4619792	That's the best advice we can give you.
4620092	4623474	Always just keep playing, practice, practice, practice, and you'll get it eventually.
4623514	4623854	Good luck.
4623874	4629157	DDRholic says, it isn't so much an FU, but just a question.
4629821	4631202	Where have you guys been on Wednesdays?
4631222	4633783	Do you guys go to RVGL on another day or have you just been busy?
4634083	4638205	Oh, but she does want to second Loki's FU to the commercialism of the holidays, especially the competition.
4638525	4641326	Who freaking cares who has the most expensive decorations?
4641446	4642146	Amen, sister.
4642386	4643347	Just for a second there, guys.
4643367	4644607	We keep reading your name.
4644907	4645328	Oh, I'm sorry.
4645348	4648049	I'm saying D-D-Arcoholic, but that's a different person.
4648449	4649329	D-D-Arcoholic.
4650270	4651810	Like an alcoholic.
4652070	4652350	Okay.
4652811	4653211	My bad.
4653751	4656392	This is why I'm not in real radio.
4657253	4658113	D-D-Arcoholic.
4658837	4665960	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4684808	4686990	and probably on Thursday actually, not Wednesday.
4687050	4687410	So we'll see.
4687430	4688731	It's a little bit easier to get there on Thursday.
4688751	4690152	A little bit easier for us to get there on Thursday.
4690172	4692974	Sometimes it may transfer the time to Scandia because we love Scandia so much more.
4693114	4693655	But you know what?
4693935	4695916	Diddy, Alcoholic, dear, send me an email.
4696697	4701100	Send the show an email, orangelawnsradio at yahoo.com and we'll plan a day to hook up and meet because we like you.
4701340	4702541	And I can give up a Wednesday.
4702561	4704643	I can give up a Wednesday one week to come meet you.
4705003	4705483	We can do that.
4706124	4706304	Sure.
4706324	4707025	Do you have something to say?
4707065	4707345	Bradley.
4708285	4709066	Yes, no, maybe so?
4709106	4709506	Yeah, sure.
4709546	4709686	Hello.
4709787	4709987	Hello.
4712507	4713488	Oh, do I have music?
4713528	4713868	No.
4714128	4714928	I can get you some music.
4714988	4715288	Hold on.
4715309	4720471	I'm going to get you some happy guitar freaky music here if I can find some.
4720951	4722412	Yeah, I'm going to give you something new.
4722672	4723292	You want Kachaka?
4723793	4724433	Let's do Kachaka.
4725553	4726534	Kachaka, Kachaka.
4727614	4727855	Oh, well.
4728055	4728455	Who cares?
4728675	4729816	Neither does Cowgirl, but hey.
4730096	4733117	I'll take fuck you to secondhand smoke.
4733137	4737359	Because I really, really, really hate cigarette smoke.
4737379	4740241	It's one of my most hated smells in the entire world.
4741480	4760785	and especially a bad because like in one of the local arcade or the jail guitar freaks and drum manias kind of close to the front door so often I smell the smoke from the parents who I smoke with a few packs of 10 and kill my lungs for a while
4762382	4767704	and also fuck you to the cigarette smoke that's closest to my door at some mysterious location.
4768204	4772606	I don't feel any air ducts from the cracks in the windows or something.
4772666	4776728	It's just noise and a lot of stuff.
4776788	4782370	And for this week, fuck you to myself for being a thoughtless bastard and never calling my parents.
4783564	4786026	and our Asian relatives for Thanksgiving.
4786686	4787066	That's right.
4787086	4788607	Thanksgiving is a commercial holiday.
4789008	4789988	It's Butterball independent.
4790028	4790749	Don't worry about it.
4790769	4793871	Sorry I have to talk to you, but I'm coming over to save your room.
4809142	4810323	I did that to my family.
4811324	4813006	I'm getting a recommendation.
4813046	4815868	I need to check the email box because we don't want to miss any FUs.
4815988	4816889	So going back.
4817069	4817610	Here we go.
4817770	4818671	Yes, we've got a couple.
4818711	4819531	Damn, we've got a few.
4820312	4821193	Okay, so here we go.
4821393	4822694	First off from Black Lab.
4823275	4826918	Fuck that zebra that tried to bite my damn fingers off on Friday, stupid zebras.
4827258	4831022	Fuck my whiny ass brother for bitching about every single thing I've done this weekend.
4831082	4833184	Fuck space heaters that don't work because it's too cold.
4833724	4862359	fuck lemurs for being so damn loud in the middle of the night damn crippled lemur acting stupid at 2am woke me up and fuck the 3 days before Thanksgiving because I had 2 midterms, a large programming assignment and a 1400 word paper draft due all in those 3 days I missed 24 that week and only got 6 hours of sleep over the course of those 3 days ooh you missed a good episode of 24 somebody died, I won't say who though fuck my finals coming up a week from now moving right along
4864734	4866755	This one comes from Mooheimer.
4867135	4867796	Hello, Mooheimer.
4867856	4875780	He says, my fuckyous would be the damn expansion pack enemies in Diablo 2 and dumb weathermen for getting me all excited about a snowstorm that turned into nothing.
4875920	4876860	Fuck those weathermen.
4877381	4879542	You know, I actually was going to be a weatherman.
4883981	4885062	I think that's where it came from.
4885362	4885922	I don't know.
4886543	4886803	Anyway.
4888585	4892108	And then we had some FUs from Martin, who's the guy that sent us the email earlier in the show.
4892168	4892869	He's got a lot, too.
4892889	4895651	He says, Fuck Christmas shopping for all the crazy people.
4895731	4898294	Fuck the crazy people that shop during the Christmas shopping season.
4898314	4902297	Fuck my manager for making me work the day after Thanksgiving and not giving me hazard pay.
4903438	4905260	Fuck the blue whale for not living on land.
4907807	4913371	Fuck my teacher for saying the word land in a question that could have given my class a pizza party.
4915293	4916094	I don't know what that means.
4916114	4917475	I'm not saying the word land.
4917535	4917875	I don't know.
4918436	4920958	Fuck the African elephant for being so big.
4921338	4921578	Yes!
4921939	4923039	Fuck the African elephant.
4923059	4924120	You're too big!
4924481	4924921	Too big!
4926462	4927123	Too big!
4928649	4932072	Fuck the arcade for banning me for a week for Matrix walking.
4932633	4936136	Shame, shame, you shouldn't be kicking machines.
4936177	4937057	Tsk, tsk, tsk.
4938219	4939220	Banning's a little harsh.
4939680	4943444	If they didn't tell you not to do it, then they should at least have a courtesy warning.
4943464	4948228	But if they warned you and said don't do it, then you did it again, can't have much sympathy for you.
4948269	4949650	You gotta respect the arcade's rules.
4949710	4952232	But if they just kicked you out with no warning, that's not cool, so fuck them.
4953853	4957315	and fuck his computer for not being compatible with 3DXcelic Creator Card.
4957395	4959456	Again, he must be on a Mac.
4962237	4964017	Alright, that's it.
4964078	4966518	That's the FUs of the week.
4966619	4972901	All of them wrapped into one big little... Oh, I got a response from DDRcoholic.
4972941	4975022	Says, I can say holic if I want.
4975502	4977302	because it can be my nickname for her.
4977322	4978943	So I get to call her DDRholic if I want.
4979183	4984724	Um, and one quick F you because of the, uh, little image that flashed up on your screen while you were closing down Yahoo.
4985384	4990085	F you to that stupid movie Extreme Ops because that's the pissed pile of shit I've ever seen.
4990505	4990905	Look at that!
4991385	4994145	Ooh, we're gonna add extreme people in a spy situation.
4994165	4995765	Wait, that's never been done before.
4996006	4998506	Oh, wait, yeah it was.
4998546	5001887	So, yeah, F you for these stupid extreme spy movies.
5002027	5003467	No one wants us to get it, no one cares.
5003587	5004447	Fuck bad movies.
5005356	5006277	Fuck Lawyers, Fuck IMAX
5028140	5030081	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5047707	5049208	That's about it on the platter for now.
5049808	5051989	All sorts of fun.
5053610	5057791	We're going to start this music break off with a little song from 2DX6Style.
5057831	5058852	It's a very popular one.
5058872	5060012	You may have heard it a couple times.
5060472	5061953	It's going to be in DDR Extreme as well.
5062593	5062913	Enjoy.
5062933	5064854	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
5081451	5082193	DJ Ranma S
5186499	5187160	Hi, we're back.
5187200	5188801	We're going to do a quick mic check here.
5189302	5191844	No, see, we're not coming through if I don't turn that booster on.
5192545	5193926	There, now you can hear us, see?
5194546	5196608	We're trying to fix our audio problems right now here in-house.
5196628	5199991	Let me see if we can turn down the volume a little bit.
5200952	5202093	Can you still hear us just fine?
5202233	5203054	Hello, hello.
5203795	5204315	Can you hear me now?
5204335	5204916	Can you hear me now?
5205576	5205977	Can you hear me now?
5208676	5210136	I still hear it a little bit, though.
5210176	5210937	It's so annoying.
5212397	5213597	I don't know what's causing that, you guys.
5213657	5214437	I apologize.
5214657	5216158	We're trying to do what we can.
5217218	5222019	I may have to just kind of throw the computer against a brick wall this week and see if we can't fix it that way.
5222279	5224640	We'll pick up the pieces and put it back together with duct tape.
5226100	5226880	Mute your line in.
5227861	5228941	The line in is muted.
5229961	5230361	I don't know.
5230621	5231121	I don't know, you guys.
5231161	5231522	I'm sorry.
5231742	5232142	We'll figure it out.
5232162	5233242	We'll see what we can do about the popping.
5234019	5235502	Just deal.
5235822	5238006	In the meantime, here's something from Poppin' Music.
5238167	5238968	We're going to play for you guys.
5239549	5241413	And then we will be right back.
5350413	5351858	Thank you for watching!
5402620	5403381	DarkSakura.com
5454777	5479188	Dream on my little boy, dream on my little boy Dream on my little boy, go out and have some joy Little boy, dream on my little boy Dream on my little boy Go out and have some joy
5552506	5553614	Thank you for watching!
5661553	5666519	From the 23rd Megas, our source for useless Bomani stuff, comes our Bomani science lesson of the day.
5667299	5670183	Not even the Orange Lounge is immune to the effects of gravity.
5678200	5680042	Hooray, a fan-made promo we got.
5680082	5680722	And it's tack.
5681222	5684265	And it has tack, so it already gets Jamie's seal of approval.
5685486	5685926	We like that.
5686907	5688688	Thank you, 23Megas, for sending us that promo.
5688708	5689749	Although it is a little quiet.
5689929	5695894	You do want to double-check and make sure that it's always nice and loud, that your levels are somewhere in the yellow.
5695994	5697856	Not in the red, but just at the tip of the yellow.
5698436	5700057	Just a little recording advice tip from me.
5700097	5701078	But otherwise, fantastic.
5701118	5701459	We love it.
5702679	5706720	Um, let's see, let's talk about some actual Bamani news this week, shall we?
5706801	5707181	No!
5707201	5710282	Well, it's not really news, but just kind of some interesting little things.
5710382	5712983	Is it Bamani Olds?
5713023	5715103	Yeah, it's Bamani Olds.
5715363	5724606	There was an interesting thread that came up on one of the big message boards this week that talks about a solo machine that was upgraded to a Max 2.
5725186	5725507	What?
5726247	5729748	Somebody took a solo machine and upgraded it to a Max 2.
5731460	5732641	What is the freaking point?
5732701	5740506	Because if you recall, Max 2 has no six-panel mode in it, so you've pretty much just taken two of your arrows and completely wasted them.
5741086	5746150	I'm bringing up pictures here in the room so that Jamie can take a look for herself, see what this machine's all about.
5746510	5750452	What do you think it... Loki, I gotta get your opinion on this, being the tech massa.
5750612	5753774	Wait, it curves the bar forward.
5753795	5755215	Well, that's a typical solo bar.
5755235	5756356	A solo bar looks like that.
5756416	5757457	That's different than Max 2.
5758397	5760479	That means it's actually a Japanese machine, by the way.
5760879	5762540	You can rate the bar in a whole new way.
5762880	5763721	That's a Japanese machine.
5764161	5766042	Okay.
5766343	5769885	They just put a DDR Max upgrade in the solo machine.
5769905	5771406	What more do you need to know?
5771426	5772066	That's all they did.
5772086	5774328	There's no modifications to it at all.
5774408	5776489	There's just no way they're going to play doubles.
5776629	5779291	And it's actually kind of retarded because if you play doubles, you're fucked.
5779651	5783876	Yeah, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at the solos, or the doubles score ranking here.
5784997	5786859	It's always going to be empty, forever.
5787200	5792746	You're fucked if you pick doubles, so it's guitar, unless it's your own home thing, and that's all you've got, it's a solo machine, but...
5794728	5795548	It's really stupid.
5795588	5798550	Go to 4th Plus or even that unofficial 5th Mix.
5800511	5804132	Don't stick with it.
5804473	5805493	Here's the cream of the crop.
5805693	5813777	As it says in the post, I believe it says in the post somewhere, it says later, oh yeah, and then there's a regular Max 2 machine, just two machines over from this.
5814617	5815498	That's so stupid.
5817198	5817739	That's retarded.
5817759	5817999	Don't!
5820829	5825374	and the retard... That gets the Special Olympic Award stamp of the day.
5825414	5826835	Go figure, this guy's in Canada.
5827676	5828997	Just kidding, just kidding.
5829037	5829618	We love Canadians.
5831860	5834221	I just want to say controversial things on this program.
5834241	5834921	What can I say?
5835961	5836481	Let's see.
5836521	5838402	That goes with my hatred of the Greek.
5839002	5840002	Oh wait, it was a Greek?
5840022	5843363	Yeah, but you have a good reason to hate them because they banned games.
5843623	5844384	Because they're stupid.
5845044	5846904	I watched my big fat Greek wedding.
5847404	5847864	Did you?
5848105	5848485	Yeah.
5848685	5851065	That totally sounds like a movie you would not like.
5852046	5852546	It was alright.
5853226	5854186	Loki, it sounds like a movie.
5854566	5855447	Oh, Brad, what do you think of this?
5855507	5857047	It's a Max 2 solo machine.
5859105	5860205	I'm gonna go play Animal Crossing.
5861386	5862646	Good answer, good answer.
5863506	5866547	That wins my special-enough-for-the-Olympic-stamp award of the day.
5867847	5868927	They get to ride the short bus.
5870168	5872548	With their own max solo machine, ooh.
5874549	5880930	The only thing that could be possibly worse than a max two solo machine is a max one solo machine.
5881971	5882871	Or a solo bass.
5884324	5886285	No, I think a solo bass is slightly better.
5886945	5888426	At least it has my baby mama.
5888626	5890646	I got even better.
5890726	5892047	I wouldn't exactly say upgrading.
5892407	5895888	Downgrading a Max 2 full machine to a solo bass.
5898729	5899990	That's retarded right there.
5900805	5906647	The only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is somebody playing Burning Heat on that Max 2 solo machine.
5906667	5907367	God.
5907888	5908328	Okay.
5909888	5910489	Oh, yes, yes.
5911889	5918772	I know this is a few episodes back, but the only thing worse than a Max 2 solo machine is Upskirt Beatmania 5Key.
5918792	5919152	No, the cam.
5924595	5924935	Anyway.
5924975	5927236	Let's talk about another topic, shall we?
5927336	5928337	Next, please.
5928477	5929417	Moving right along.
5930258	5930598	Oh, yes.
5930778	5944064	We were talking about another interesting thread that I saw was about this kind of... Since the Christmas season is here, there's this sudden push, and DDR is getting bigger and bigger and more and more well-known.
5944124	5945285	Bigger and bitter.
5945305	5948086	We're all getting bitter as the jaded old schoolers we are.
5948746	5949827	We see that there's...
5950808	5958736	There's these new children's Dance Pats games coming out, including a Barney game, a Barbie dance game that you plug directly into your TV.
5958756	5962759	That's been out for a while, but of course it's Christmas time, so a lot of the stores are pushing these again.
5963000	5966423	You know, here's a Christmas toy that won't make your kid fat.
5967083	5968184	That's basically how they're marketing these.
5968565	5969185	This is very old.
5972546	5974387	The Jungle Book dancing game.
5974767	5978330	Now for those who don't know out there, this was out before Max USA even was.
5978350	5979991	I remember going to your old apartment.
5980691	5982272	I had the Jungle Book dance game.
5982312	5984433	Playing on that tiny ass little pad.
5985014	5987796	The Jungle Book dance pad was my very first dance pad.
5987836	5989937	I actually have the Jungle Book game too, but I don't have the pad.
5990317	5993900	and Jamie brought over third mix one night and we played all night long.
5993920	5994561	It was so much fun.
5994581	5996262	Here, let me liberate your mind.
5996843	5998264	It was beautiful.
5998624	6003469	Before that, all I'd ever seen was USA and first mix and all of a sudden you put in third mix.
6003489	6005010	I'm like, oh my god.
6005050	6005811	There's modes.
6005971	6009354	Holiday, erotic, I'm in love.
6010111	6011533	and it has karaoke mode too!
6011914	6013095	Yes, in karaoke mode!
6013456	6015078	Which there has never been in another mix.
6015739	6018943	Now, what do you guys think of all these little kid games?
6018983	6021967	Do you think it's good for the money because it trains them at a young age?
6022027	6024850	I want the Hello Kitty DDR.
6025131	6026032	This is for five year olds.
6026052	6027133	It's actually a DDR.
6029170	6033092	Where's the Oha Kids arcade games?
6033172	6034152	Don't they have one in Vegas?
6034932	6038074	Did you say that one arcade you went to, they had a DDR for kids?
6038134	6038874	No.
6039034	6040075	I'm just on crack, I'm sorry.
6040095	6041535	They had Radiant Silvergun.
6041875	6041995	Oh.
6042275	6043576	Who had the DDR for kids?
6043936	6046037	I could have sworn somebody told me somebody in Vegas had them.
6046097	6048638	I think it was in San Fran, I think.
6048658	6049258	Frisco.
6049378	6050479	Very interesting.
6052446	6060229	Let's see, uh, I wouldn't call, some people in the chat room are talking about Disney's, Disney's Rave being a kid game.
6060830	6062550	Or, I'm sorry, Disney Mix in the U.S.
6063191	6066772	I don't know, I don't, it's, you think Disney's Mix is for kids?
6067233	6069674	I think Dance Magic makes Disney Mix, though.
6069814	6074736	Disney's Rave is for, like, people who are like, I would like Parapara, but I want to get in the DDR.
6074856	6075476	Boom, there you go.
6076256	6076757	That's what it is.
6076817	6079138	It's just all, it's DDR Parapara Mix.
6080323	6084305	VidPower, who's from Vegas, by the way, is confirming they do have a DDR Kids machine there.
6085325	6086606	I don't know if that means it's OHA.
6086666	6087927	Is it OHA songs?
6088467	6090408	VidPower, what are the songs in DDR Kids?
6090448	6091968	Is it OHA stuff, or what is it?
6093689	6096910	I'm just kind of asking questions to our chat room, waiting for a reply.
6097871	6099492	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
6100532	6101933	Yeah.
6103433	6103673	OHA.
6103713	6104654	What are you guys talking about over there?
6105650	6108331	We're talking about Gameland in Las Vegas.
6108451	6109452	Okay, talk about Gameland.
6109472	6111753	Now, Gameland has DDR Kids.
6111773	6113814	It's being confirmed by VidPower.
6113914	6114654	VidPower's from Vegas.
6114674	6119917	Then they must have gotten it after I played there, because I was there for the DDR Kids moderator trip.
6120697	6131802	And what they had, I went in there, and this is actually, when everybody was quoting each other what we said for the moderator trip, this is what I was quoted as going, Silvergun!
6132992	6135474	Oh, it's not OHA songs, I'm being corrected.
6135494	6137435	It's just different songs.
6137855	6138695	That's all I can get.
6138996	6139496	Special.
6140056	6140817	Different places!
6140857	6142037	Hey, get us a song list.
6142257	6143258	Yeah, get us a song list.
6143298	6144139	We want to talk about it.
6145159	6145840	We want to come play.
6145860	6146720	We're going to go to Vegas.
6147020	6149862	We're planning an Orange Lounge Vegas trip at some point.
6149882	6151323	Yeah, and someone can pay for it.
6151723	6154024	Oh, VidPower does confirm they got it after you were there.
6154405	6154725	Okay.
6155725	6155845	So...
6157526	6159187	Yeah, we're gonna have to go play DDR Kids Mix.
6159287	6159927	That sounds like fun.
6160127	6162668	It's certainly better than anything that bitch Barbie can come up with.
6162688	6164449	I'm sorry, yes?
6164469	6165850	Did you say Barbie or Barney?
6170011	6170712	They have them both.
6171332	6175876	Oh my god, I'm not going to dance to I Love You, You Love Me.
6175896	6176857	And they're both bitches.
6177077	6178539	Almost.
6178879	6180520	By the way, your shirt's cool.
6180901	6181241	I know.
6181361	6183063	Brad is wearing an 8-bit theater shirt.
6183243	6185145	I know, I probably mentioned this on the radio already.
6185265	6186186	It's a black mage.
6186406	6189368	Yeah, it says Bolt 2, motherfucker.
6189388	6189509	Sick.
6192029	6193031	Other big things in the news.
6193051	6193932	This is big news.
6193952	6197418	It has really nothing to do with Bimani, but it's big news in the gaming world.
6197979	6201385	As most Bimani people are a bunch of big gaming addicts, we thought we'd mention it.
6202146	6202887	Square and Enix.
6203869	6206852	Enix Bot Square did this little merger type thing?
6207132	6209614	I thought that it was a merger of equals because of their name.
6209634	6210755	Yeah, it's a merger of equals.
6210935	6221204	No, but once I looked at the stuff, I'm going to have to go check the business site to confirm it, but I think that Enix holds a 70-80% share, so it's not a pure merger of equals.
6221744	6224566	If it was a merger of equals, the ratio would be no more than 10% different.
6225567	6227308	Any thoughts on what's going to happen because of this?
6227448	6234152	We're going to be getting Final Quest Fantasy X with all of the art done by Toriyama.
6234693	6235073	Urgits!
6235433	6235873	Urgits!
6236154	6237194	I want more Urgits!
6239155	6240616	Really, the fighting game, right?
6240817	6244419	Air Guys.
6244439	6247020	We're going to get Air Guys with the Dragon Quest characters.
6247941	6251123	Well, you know, didn't Enix, weren't they responsible for Buster Groove?
6253087	6270178	Bust a Move Yes, Anex and Metro were responsible for Bust a Move and Bust a Move 2 They're also, you know, I still haven't gotten to play Bust a Move 2001 or whatever the hell it was DDR Bust a Move 2003 with Cloud and Yuffie, oh my god
6274000	6280022	I honestly don't think they're going to be lame and start crossing all their storylines.
6280042	6287005	I don't think a damn thing's going to change.
6287606	6288966	Actraiser was the best game ever.
6289907	6290467	I'm so moist.
6291647	6296890	Since, what's his name, Uematsu's not going to do Final Fantasy music anymore, they're phasing him out, they need to get that guy who did Actraiser's music.
6297250	6297930	They need to get him.
6298310	6299971	That's going to be the best thing about this.
6300151	6305833	I actually come to think of it, the pre-show disc, I actually have an Overclocked remix of the Fillmore theme.
6307214	6308935	I love, oh yeah, Act Tracer.
6309235	6319819	Anyway, Dan and I had a discussion about this, and for anybody who knows me and Dan or has heard me talk about him or us talk,
6321161	6323464	We're both really major gamers.
6323484	6325986	We own like 42 video game systems.
6328409	6339020	Anyway, we were having this discussion and we decided that it might be a good thing because I want to catch Annex up to the modern day and teach Square how to be old school again.
6342689	6371159	I honestly think this is happening for a couple reasons A. Final Fantasy XI fucking tanked in Japan because they fucked it up they completely fucked up that hard drive thing and the online bad idea Final Fantasy Online was a bad idea Square Japan had nothing to do with the movie and the movie was actually good it just shouldn't have been named Final Fantasy B. The movie fucked it up for Square honestly the movie was decent but it wasn't it was not Final Fantasy
6371719	6374441	They should not have been called Final Fantasy, did not deserve the Final Fantasy name.
6374461	6376362	As a movie, the movie was good.
6377083	6380125	The movie was good, but it wasn't Final Fantasy.
6380165	6381105	Right, it wasn't Final Fantasy.
6381566	6381866	Thank you.
6382226	6383527	That's all I have to say on that.
6383887	6390872	But, and this is what I always said, well a friend of mine always talked about this too, because the movie was really being designed about the time the 8 was made.
6391312	6394274	Honestly, the movie should have been a game...
6395140	6410375	and 8 should have been the movie 8 would have been awesome 8 would have been an excellent movie and it made a horrible game or 10 as the movie but 10, see 10 the thing with Final Fantasy 10 I can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy on a DDR show but hey the thing with Final Fantasy 10
6411876	6417362	is that the way it's designed is that next generation of movie slash game.
6418043	6419144	You don't see it as a movie.
6419184	6419965	It's a cinematic RPG.
6419985	6421767	Yeah, it's a cinematic RPG.
6421907	6425511	I would have liked if they created a movie that's kind of a cross between 7 and 10.
6426171	6430256	Because 7 had really cool futuristic worlds and all the machines and stuff.
6430816	6433419	And then 10 had that really kick-ass stuff in it too.
6433839	6434220	I love...
6434801	6438687	I love that one song, Otherworld, that's in the very beginning.
6438747	6441352	That's the heavy metal music that's in it.
6441452	6442634	It's fucking awesome.
6442974	6443735	I love that song.
6444508	6458015	Well, you know, one thing, I was reading an interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who was like the best artist in the world, who did all of the original character designs for the first Final Fantasy games, you know, 1 through 6.
6459756	6462797	He didn't do any of the character designs for 7 or 8.
6463998	6470081	He did them for 9, but he was very discouraged by the direction that the Final Fantasy series was going in.
6470601	6471262	Thanks for watching!
6495505	6499389	It's always for me, them in the Magitek armor walking across the ice plain.
6510115	6511636	He's teasing me because my voice is cracking.
6511976	6513456	Oh my god.
6514196	6515877	Can we just call you Ron Weasley now?
6515997	6516477	Shut up.
6516857	6517358	Shut up.
6517798	6518818	No, he doesn't have the right name.
6518858	6519378	Shut up.
6519838	6520158	Alright.
6520198	6522279	We'll just put you in a Ford and have you drive around.
6522499	6525840	Speaking of Final Fantasy, why don't we get to this week's cage match, shall we?
6526100	6527601	Unless anything else... Cage match!
6527641	6530862	Does anybody else have something to say about Square, Enix, merging?
6531402	6532483	Does anyone really give a shit?
6532703	6533703	I don't give a shit, personally.
6533723	6535344	A couple comments ago, you said something about it.
6535484	6536784	You can't believe we're talking about Final Fantasy.
6536824	6538865	I can make a... I can make a... What is it?
6538885	6539045	The...
6540717	6542298	Kevin Bacon thing, Six Degrees, or whatever.
6542799	6544681	It's probably going to be made by Squaresoft.
6544701	6546623	Squaresoft made a game called Brave Fenster Musashi.
6546663	6552249	At the end of Brave Fenster Musashi, there's a music dance game that's pretty much like DDR, but it's, yeah, actually it's like Simon Says.
6552289	6552569	Really?
6552669	6553310	There you go, yep.
6553830	6555172	Damn, I've got to play that game now.
6555993	6561598	There's a DDR mode in SNK versus Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
6562651	6563471	That's not Squaresoft.
6564132	6564572	No, there's DDR.
6564592	6567413	Everything goes back to Konami.
6567573	6572435	On a total different tangent here, the chatroom is now trying to put us all with Harry Potter characters.
6572495	6573236	Jamie, you're now Hermione.
6573256	6575157	I would not be Hermione, hello?
6576617	6581740	Okay, because first of all, with every damn sorting test I've ever taken, I always come up Slytherin.
6581780	6583280	She's Draco, because she's evil.
6583580	6584981	I'm not that bad.
6585101	6587062	And I guess that leaves Loki to be Harry Potter.
6588202	6588983	Get the glasses!
6590851	6592272	I have glasses and I don't look like Harry Potter.
6592292	6593032	Here, I've got makeup somewhere.
6593052	6594893	We can draw, like, a little lightning scar on his head.
6595193	6596333	I'm not gonna be pansy.
6596413	6596694	Hello.
6596714	6597034	Sucks.
6602945	6605067	April Fool's Day
6626690	6628791	We could all be having the wool pulled over our eyes on this.
6628831	6630552	Like I said, I don't think it's really going to matter anyway.
6630612	6631052	So what?
6631092	6631613	They merge.
6631893	6632633	Big fucking deal.
6633894	6634314	I don't care.
6635234	6635755	Next.
6636435	6636895	Next.
6637376	6639116	Nobody accepts this finishing position.
6639136	6643079	I'm going to turn on the amp here because I need some in-studio sound to deal with this.
6644959	6646260	We apologize for the humming again.
6646300	6647301	We don't know what's causing it.
6647341	6651463	We're going to take a hammer to the computer after the show and figure out what's going on.
6651563	6652683	So we apologize.
6653004	6653844	It's something to do with the mics.
6653884	6654945	Maybe our mics are just cheap.
6655025	6655385	I don't know.
6656078	6656419	DarkSakura.com
6674102	6678126	We're going to play a couple songs all the way through, and then we're going to review them.
6678506	6680148	Actually, we're just going to play a clip.
6680168	6684111	You can vote for last week's winner, but we're only going to play a small clip of it.
6684151	6691598	Because you all have been listening to our Bomani Music Amore program, airing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're not on, and you've heard it already, right?
6691698	6691918	Yes?
6691978	6692939	You don't need to play it all again.
6694100	6697902	So we're going to give our opinions on the songs again.
6697922	6700164	Of course, the new one's going to be played all the way through.
6700664	6705246	You, as the chat room, get to decide which one of these is going to be our next big thing.
6705426	6709949	Yes, so the winner of the cage match will be put into rotation on the normal Bimani Music and More program this week.
6709969	6710889	So you're going to vote for a winner.
6711310	6713491	Now, you can vote for last week's victor.
6714811	6717333	But once last week's winner wins what?
6717413	6718313	Once the song wins what?
6718353	6720755	Three, four weeks, we retire it and it can't win anymore.
6721095	6721535	What do we think?
6721575	6721995	Four weeks?
6722796	6722996	Three?
6725523	6725983	We give it a month.
6726243	6726844	We give it a month.
6726904	6727704	Okay, so four weeks.
6727744	6729845	If a song wins for four weeks, it gets retired.
6731025	6732046	Yeah, then it goes in permanently.
6732366	6738888	So, this is our winner from last week was the Final Fantasy Music DJ.
6738928	6743570	This was an overclocked remix of... I'm sorry, yes, Loki, would you like to explain last week's feature?
6744090	6746091	It was a remix from Final Fantasy 7.
6746171	6746591	It's the...
6768951	6772692	Alright, that was last week's Victor, the Coral Prison remix theme.
6772812	6775173	That was an overclocked remix by FFMusicDJ.
6775653	6778294	So you can vote for that, or you can vote for something new!
6780154	6780834	It's new!
6781554	6787656	And in the mix this week we have, this is something from the pre-show, but it's so fucking cool, we're putting it in the cage match.
6787996	6789237	Jamie, please tell us.
6790377	6794618	I was looking for happy hardcore remakes last night, and I filmed the Knight Rider theme.
6795194	6795956	Never knows the hair.
6805629	6808911	David Hasselhoff was just like, in the 80s he was cool.
6809611	6811512	David Hasselhoff, he's so dreamy.
6811632	6815134	And then there was Baywatch, and he's loved in Germany.
6816795	6817976	I think we should just play this song.
6818176	6822698	Alright, so the first song, and remember you cannot vote until the second song is finished playing.
6822778	6826180	So we're going to play the first song for you in today's cage match.
6826200	6828981	This is the Knight Rider theme from Happy Hardcore.
6829482	6829842	Enjoy.
6833939	6836770	My bad, it's not from Happy To Be Hardcore, it's just a random mix.
6837071	6837493	But here it is.
6971818	6973941	Thanks for watching!
7025675	7028377	All right, the cage match is in effect here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7028398	7030259	That was the Knight Rider theme.
7030299	7031981	What did you guys think of that here in the room?
7032021	7032281	Jamie?
7032301	7033462	God damn, that was cool.
7033682	7034082	All right.
7034182	7035784	Dave, what did you think of the Knight Rider theme?
7036284	7037305	It was pretty cool.
7037325	7041128	Yeah, it was pretty cool.
7041168	7041449	All right.
7041529	7041869	Loki?
7042449	7043010	I liked it.
7043130	7044411	I liked the original theme.
7045092	7047414	It kind of lost a little bit of it in the middle there.
7048034	7048455	I liked the 20s.
7048495	7048895	I liked the 20s.
7051997	7056001	Bradley, your thoughts on the Knight Rider mix?
7056041	7056381	Pretty good.
7057302	7062206	I'd have to say it's cool for about the first minute when that nostalgia kicks in, but three minutes of it is a little bit much.
7062266	7062607	I don't know.
7063147	7064468	Alright, rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.
7064528	7066030	Jamie, on a scale of 1 to 10.
7067499	7075422	9, Dave, 8, Loki, 8, Bradley, 7, and I'll give it a 7.5.
7075922	7078863	Alright, so I'm a harsh judge, what can I say?
7078903	7080104	Alright, that was the Knight Rider theme.
7080124	7084306	So, we got one more song here for the cage match, and I'm going to play that for you right now.
7084346	7087227	It's coming off a CD, so I don't know how this is going to work.
7087587	7090148	Might be a little weird, but Loki, why don't you intro this for me, please?
7090968	7095511	This is going to be, it's off of their brand new CD, Community Service.
7095611	7100494	This is a remix done by Hybrid of the Crystal Method, the name of the game.
7100554	7102976	It's Hybrid's LA Blackout remix.
7104056	7106478	Alright, this is the second one in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.
7106498	7108279	This is the Crystal Method with the name of the game.
7425099	7426160	Call it more friends!
7458130	7460691	All right, that was Crystal Method with the name of the game.
7461231	7462392	Jamie, your thoughts on that?
7462452	7463372	Oh, you're yawning over there.
7463392	7465633	It's a little boring to you.
7465694	7466394	Okay, I see.
7466674	7467874	Dave, your thoughts?
7468795	7469975	Loki had the right idea.
7469995	7470636	Cut it down.
7470916	7471836	It's a shorter time.
7471996	7473037	Yes.
7473577	7474417	Brad's in the room.
7474437	7475278	What did you think of that?
7475298	7476378	You didn't get to comment on the last one.
7476398	7477319	What did you think of this one?
7477339	7479700	Well, the original last song has always been my favorite Crystal Method song ever.
7479740	7482821	I've always said that DC and DX and I would love to do it next as well.
7482841	7484942	But, hey, I don't know if I can do it.
7485022	7486603	I don't know if I can do it.
7487303	7489004	Loki, what did you think of it?
7489125	7490485	I like the song.
7490606	7492627	Obviously, yes, it was too long.
7492667	7496790	The original one is also my favorite Christmas song ever.
7497470	7499251	I do have to add, though, that this is my turn.
7499331	7500852	It's the perfect pre-entry.
7500913	7504975	Except I've cut it down to two and a half minutes.
7505015	7507617	No longer is it two and a half minutes, but yeah, I like it.
7507637	7509678	Bradley, your thoughts?
7509698	7511340	I've been really good at that one.
7511380	7512620	I've been really good at that one.
7513121	7513201	Uh...
7514821	7517642	My thoughts, it's a cool song for a minute and a half.
7518302	7519723	Same thing as the last song.
7519983	7524044	A little long, a little long for me, but I bet it's going to kick a lot of ass in DDR, a DDR edit.
7524605	7526385	Let's break it down, scale of 1 to 10.
7526425	7526745	Jamie?
7527726	7532047	It had lots of parts that I liked, and I thought they were good.
7533488	7534568	I give it a 6.5.
7534648	7535549	6.5 from Jamie.
7535969	7536289	Dave?
7537189	7543592	Yeah, I mean, whenever it switched to a new part, then it was cool, but then it kept going on that part for like a minute and a half each.
7544873	7546795	So, um, I'll be generous.
7546895	7548075	I'll give it a 7.
7548115	7548075	7.
7548336	7548676	Brad.
7548736	7551218	Since I didn't hear their whole song, I have to be fair.
7551278	7553719	I guess I can't give it a 10 or anything.
7554180	7558262	But I mean, it sounded good when I heard it, so I guess I'll give it a 7.
7558302	7558262	7.
7559103	7559403	Loki.
7559583	7562145	Well, I can be biased because it's my song, so I'm giving it a 10.
7562345	7562686	Alright, 10.
7563346	7563726	Bradley.
7563846	7564747	I'll give it a 10.
7566053	7567754	I give it a 6.5 as well.
7568774	7569994	Alright, there's your votes.
7570515	7573456	So, now it's time for the important people to vote.
7573476	7574556	That's you in the chatroom.
7574616	7577177	Send me your votes over private message.
7577837	7582038	Send your votes over private message to Sky in the chatroom right now and we will reveal the votes.
7582058	7584079	These, once again, are your choices.
7584539	7586700	You can vote for last week's winner.
7587160	7591101	The Final Fantasy Music DJ with a remix of Choral Prison.
7592942	7593582	String Machine.
7600147	7603268	You can vote for Happy Hardcore Knight Rider theme.
7605349	7607709	Or you can vote for The Crystal Method, the name of the game.
7621129	7622469	Those are your choices.
7622989	7625270	Send your votes in right now.
7625330	7627110	And don't send them over DCC chat.
7627150	7628431	I can't accept those during the show.
7628451	7630211	You've got to send them over normal private message.
7631091	7631311	Yes.
7632031	7632312	Yes.
7632792	7633312	Gumby.
7633792	7635192	Gumby, you should know better.
7636132	7636512	God.
7638633	7638993	Gee.
7639673	7642734	Someone who has his own little team should know...
7644245	7645287	I'm just fucking with him.
7645307	7647549	I'm giving him a hard time because I can.
7647649	7649111	Gumby likes it when I give him a hard time.
7649712	7650613	Wink wink, nudge nudge.
7650913	7653336	Say no more.
7654477	7657260	Alright, we'll be revealing those votes in a little bit.
7658602	7660544	Moving right along though, we're going to talk about...
7661861	7663082	Oh, our new web forums!
7663502	7665584	Everybody else has new sites and forums.
7665684	7666364	Why can't we?
7666464	7667485	We've got new forums.
7667905	7672128	So visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and click on forums.
7672769	7674690	And we've got some brand new forums that you can peruse.
7674770	7679954	Now, I have to state, though, they're very temporary and they're not the best forums because they're free.
7680494	7683957	They're not EasyBoard because I fucking hate EasyBoard and I wouldn't use them.
7684837	7691243	So, I use somebody else, excellent service, my ICOM board, you know, for somebody just trying to get started with a message board, it's great.
7691683	7695467	It is going to be temporary though until I've got some extra money and can buy another host.
7695567	7700331	Or somebody is very gracious and donates some space where we can put, you know, a PHP BB or something.
7701011	7701172	So...
7704560	7707082	You should visit that web board.
7707602	7709484	Oh yes, please mention the LiveJournal community.
7709504	7710004	There's always that.
7710024	7718510	If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, all one word, that is where our LiveJournal community is.
7718650	7719151	Go check it out.
7719211	7720712	It's very orange.
7721192	7721992	Yes, it's very orange.
7722033	7723153	It's a very pretty design, though.
7724214	7728936	Thank LiveJournal for that.
7728976	7731397	I just picked a default that was orange.
7731437	7732518	You just picked a default scheme.
7734059	7735800	And then, let's see, what else can we talk about?
7735900	7739041	I wanted to talk about this really fast, if I can get this to bring up.
7739802	7743844	What's being released, I believe, this week is a good, cool compilation.
7746842	7755894	I believe it's Good Cool Songs, and what they did, something about Santa's redone all the songs in English.
7756995	7761301	I don't know, at least the preview songs on the website, Santa's singing them and they're in English, and you know what?
7762384	7768325	We're going to get a quick clip of one of those songs for you right here.
7768385	7769785	Let me see if I can get you one of these.
7770245	7772586	Okay, we're going to hear a quick clip of one of these songs right here.
7772986	7777427	I apologize if we do a dropout real fast, but I want to be able to play this clip for you guys, so here we go.
7777447	7781827	I'm going to turn on the speaker so you guys in-house can hear it.
7782587	7783348	Let's see if it comes up.
7783568	7784388	It's loading right now.
7784428	7790849	I'm trying to get a clip of 19 November from the Good Cool album, which comes out on December 4th, so it comes out this week.
7791029	7791629	Okay, here we go.
7792481	7794202	Connecting, la la la la la.
7794462	7795643	Just trying to connect to the site.
7798644	7799085	Here it goes.
7799385	7801526	Here's a small clip of what this will sound like.
7829497	7831398	That was a little bit of 19 November.
7831458	7832278	What'd you guys think of that?
7832498	7833759	Does it make a CD worth buying?
7834219	7838361	Um, it's good cool since it's worth buying anyway, but, uh... That's English?
7839161	7839501	Yeah.
7839821	7845123	I know I'm gonna get, like, a freaking ass-reaming here for saying this, but they should've got freaking, uh... No!
7845383	7845604	No!
7845664	7845864	No!
7845904	7846884	Paul and Terry!
7846904	7847144	No!
7847164	7847344	No!
7847364	7847704	No!
7847724	7848625	Paul and Terry!
7849605	7851006	That's fine!
7851346	7852206	No!
7852746	7854307	God, leave.
7854327	7854547	Shoot.
7854607	7856668	You're banned from Orange Lounge just like Paul and Terry.
7856708	7856848	No.
7857108	7857748	Come back, Brad.
7857768	7858729	Come back, Brad.
7858749	7859109	We love you.
7860219	7861139	We still hate Politary.
7861280	7861640	Why?
7861780	7862660	Why Politary?
7862780	7863140	Why?
7863220	7865021	Because Santa should not be singing in English.
7865582	7866822	Hell, Santa should not be singing.
7868043	7871184	She sings because she did very nicely on the Shining Polaris.
7871204	7873445	Shining Polaris was good.
7873485	7873785	Yeah.
7874426	7875686	That's because LED kicks ass.
7876346	7877047	LED does kick ass.
7877067	7880128	They should fork out the money and get Utada Hikaru.
7881009	7881449	Or Ayumi.
7882525	7883726	Just fork out the money.
7884026	7884606	Hold on, hold on.
7884626	7892511	What's awesome is, I don't know if anybody's played the Game Boy Beatmania games, I know that's pretty ghetto, but they've got some pretty cool licensed tracks on there.
7892531	7894132	They do have a Utah Bakudo song on there.
7894172	7897634	I played the one on Wonderspawn that has the digitized music.
7898915	7901436	I played the Beatmania that was on Wonderspawn.
7901516	7902317	It was all digitized.
7902817	7906940	Yeah, I have a Wonderspawn color and the little turntable wouldn't fit on my thing very well.
7907280	7909141	Well, Guitar Freaks has to depend on you.
7910706	7911687	I can't believe it's not gagged.
7926394	7928276	No, someone needs to send me that CD for Christmas.
7945114	7962160	If somebody can get, if before Christmas, as soon as it's out, you know, you want to send us over a copy of the album, we'll get some songs in rotation on the normal, yes, if you can get us a picture, we'll get some tracks on Orange Lounge in regular rotation, the good ones, so we'll see.
7963080	7966461	Okay, we're going to take a real quick break, we'll be back.
7967305	7969267	and we're going to talk about this week's list list.
7969287	7977175	We're going to do a list list tonight and we'll do that and then we're going to reveal the vote winner, getter, top getter, vote getter.
7980057	7981658	And when the winner wins, they win.
8011204	8012266	Oh, hello, it's not playing.
8012306	8013248	Let's see what's going on here.
8014790	8015792	Just a quick problem.
8015992	8016873	We've got a quick issue.
8017254	8018596	We apologize for the inconvenience.
8019577	8024165	We have some issues, and we think the issues are fixed now, so here we go.
8179511	8180232	Thank you for watching!
8298649	8299928	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
8344750	8346511	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
8346731	8349132	Because Bongo demands it.
8371044	8375468	The Final Fantasy String Machine and the Knight Rider theme.
8375548	8387718	And the winner was, with over half the votes, out of three choices, over half the votes, the winner was... Knight Rider theme, ladies and gentlemen.
8392216	8393537	David Hasselhoff was cool.
8394417	8395057	Big difference.
8395498	8396418	Was cool.
8397018	8398859	Actually, that's borderline cool.
8399400	8400660	It was great in South Park.
8400820	8401921	Thank you to everyone who voted.
8401961	8402901	We appreciate it.
8404082	8404442	Of course.
8405723	8408364	Oh, I'm being given a link to the DDR Kids machine.
8408724	8410285	Let's have a look-see-loo at this.
8413187	8413887	A look-see-loo.
8414247	8415628	Oh, my voice got a vote.
8416408	8417708	for the cage match winner.
8417768	8418709	Thank you, Gumby.
8419169	8423030	Actually, I think it was Twin that voted for that, but hey.
8423290	8425530	Oh, there's a picture of the Danson's Revolution Kids machine.
8426370	8427671	That's so cheesy.
8427691	8428651	They were selling one on eBay.
8429031	8429731	That's so cheesy.
8429751	8430211	Remember?
8430271	8431071	They were selling one on eBay.
8431091	8431832	That's right, they were selling one.
8431852	8433972	That's probably how the place got it.
8437653	8438753	It looks like a what, Dave?
8439433	8441714	A freaky stolen machine, kind of like Mickey Mouse.
8442859	8444120	I thought you said a sewing machine.
8444480	8445281	That's what I thought you said, yeah.
8445441	8448683	It looks like one of those picture maker things, picture tape.
8449183	8450184	Uh, yeah.
8453166	8454007	Oh, very cute.
8454367	8457989	Uh, is there any other pictures of... No, it just shows all the different kinds of DDR.
8459490	8459790	Alright.
8460271	8460731	Well, whatever.
8461472	8461732	Cool.
8464994	8465374	Let's see.
8465494	8465914	Oh, a deer.
8469286	8470246	Top hits don't count.
8470287	8471127	Top hits is ass.
8472787	8473868	I'm afraid to look at this.
8475368	8476328	Oh, that's cute.
8476409	8477149	That's very cute.
8478329	8478749	Lovely.
8478809	8481210	An Orange Lounge boy-on-boy mix signature.
8481630	8481990	Beautiful.
8482010	8482891	I like boy-on-boy action.
8482911	8483291	Beautiful.
8485712	8487832	Ah, you gotta love the intelligence of our listeners.
8489513	8490433	That was twin, of course.
8490793	8493074	Who sends all the shocking weird shit?
8497449	8501110	Just like, who sends the funny, good, shocking, weird shit?
8501550	8504371	That was like what, Pyroman and the OSVB send that stuff.
8504691	8508031	Who sends the shocking, weird shit that really is shocking and weird?
8508291	8508852	That's Twin.
8509412	8509772	Yeah.
8510092	8510372	Alright.
8510432	8513773	So I think that we should move right along to our next game show.
8514053	8516253	I think we should move right into our next game show.
8516613	8519274	But we're going to first back this up with a story.
8519834	8522115	I wanted to talk about this a little bit because it's the holidays.
8522595	8523495	A story.
8523575	8523975	A story.
8524635	8527739	I gotta find this story.
8528539	8530121	And I'm logged into the wrong account right now.
8530141	8531182	I'm not going to be able to pull up the story.
8531222	8531483	Hold on.
8531903	8533445	Jamie, tell a story about your day or something.
8533525	8534946	I need time to fill here.
8535607	8537749	I did laundry today, Rob.
8539030	8540552	I washed my pants.
8540592	8543535	A clean DDR is a fun DDR and a happy DDR.
8543575	8543775	Yeah.
8547991	8562408	I played Kingdom Hearts, and then I played Max USA, and I don't know, it's so stupid how you have to play all these songs, because I've already done everything there is to do right now, and I've got nothing left to do except try to unlock songs.
8563029	8568395	And then, Dazley Never, because they ended with getting hit in the head with a weasel.
8569864	8571685	Well, no, he lit the menorah, too, right?
8573427	8574347	I do that when I get back.
8574528	8575488	Oh, you do that when you get back.
8576509	8577470	Orange Lounge comes first.
8577590	8578751	Orange Lounge always comes.
8579071	8581353	Orange Lounge is above all holy holidays.
8581473	8584255	You've seen Rob Schneider as a gigolo.
8584535	8587077	You've seen Rob Schneider as a woman.
8587457	8590780	Now, see Rob Schneider as a stapler.
8593222	8593822	Oh, crap.
8595226	8599247	I'm being given some interesting stuff, and this is coming from Gumby.
8599907	8601148	So you know this is going to be weird.
8601188	8603889	Let's see.
8604989	8610090	Gumby is sending me an article on... Good scene.
8610491	8613932	It says Gatsas in the title, which sounds like, I don't know, it's not loading.
8616072	8617333	Gumby, thy link is broken.
8617393	8617833	You suck.
8617853	8618213	You lose.
8621613	8624174	Maybe it's just because we're trying to broadcast a show and we can't see it right now.
8624234	8624594	Let's see.
8624674	8626774	I'm just following random links that the chatroom's sending me.
8626794	8627534	This is scary.
8629335	8630095	Oh, that's cute.
8630475	8631615	That's very cute.
8632475	8638537	He sent me a picture of Counter-Strike where somebody's got little red octane dance pads there and they give 100 health, apparently.
8639197	8640757	Or they take 100 health, more likely.
8641878	8643458	They also take 100 intelligence.
8647482	8648022	Ah, kill me.
8648862	8652243	Oh, I, let's see, I need to find this news article I was looking for, my bad.
8654824	8655884	Brad, tell us about your day.
8658104	8660885	I was, I was over, you know, I was over here at 4 a.m.
8660905	8663146	Pretend you don't know and tell me again.
8665306	8665586	Fuck you.
8665826	8667747	Okay, I was over here at 4 a.m.
8667767	8668907	playing your Animal Crossing.
8668927	8671147	We left, we went to bed, we woke up at 1 p.m.
8671527	8674168	Yes, we have lives, and we came over here and played more.
8676215	8677416	Rob, how was your day?
8677536	8679478	My day was fabulous, thank you for asking.
8679638	8680519	You haven't told us.
8680739	8683561	I got the link up that I wanted, thank you.
8683621	8687244	Oh yes, we're going to talk about, because the day... Rob got it up.
8688185	8688665	Shut up.
8689126	8689526	Shut up.
8689606	8690727	And on the show too.
8690867	8692288	You woman... anyway.
8692989	8693930	Yeah, hello.
8694610	8698654	Go play your Grand Theft Auto woman mix in your Miata and your VW Bug.
8701812	8711995	Bullshit, I'd have the terrain of... Anyway, we want to talk about the day after Thanksgiving is commonly known as the Oh Fuck Stay Away From The Mall Day.
8712135	8713556	In other words... Black Friday.
8713676	8714516	Black Friday.
8714956	8715716	Black Friday.
8717037	8721878	The day when you do not want to be caught dead anywhere near a mall because it's that time of year to go shopping.
8721998	8722638	I went to the mall.
8722858	8728320	And of course, every year they release the list of the top holiday toys.
8728980	8730601	So I thought they've compiled a list.
8730641	8734622	This station, WESH, I have no idea where they're located.
8735682	8736242	It doesn't matter.
8736462	8737563	It doesn't matter where they're located.
8738003	8739403	They're W, so they're East Coast.
8739824	8740844	They're somewhere East Coast.
8741384	8743705	They're stating it's a great time to start your Christmas shopping.
8743745	8745665	You can beat the rush and the shelves are stocked.
8745685	8747226	But what's going to be popular this year?
8747646	8748926	You know how kids are in general.
8748966	8751287	They don't care how much a toy costs or who makes it.
8751627	8752607	They just want to have fun.
8753048	8758089	So Yahoo site for kids, Yahooligans, gave kids a chance to vote for toys on their wish list.
8758369	8762590	And these are the top five toys that kids are looking for for Christmas this year.
8763170	8768992	The number five, this is amazing to me, the number five toy, Singing Stars Video Karaoke.
8771067	8773208	It allows kids to become the next superstar.
8773688	8775428	It's a $100 karaoke machine.
8775928	8778809	It's like American Idol, except that you don't have to get bitched at.
8778829	8779849	That should be the add-on.
8780270	8783810	It's like, get a little British guy to bitch at you and yell and tell you that you're no good.
8783911	8787832	The future generation of single, old people.
8787852	8788972	Come over to my house, I'll bitch at you.
8788992	8795374	Drunken, in a bar, singing drunken music from times when they remember they were young.
8796174	8796374	Yeah.
8797366	8798386	We're gonna be high on pixie sticks.
8799947	8801047	I weep for the future.
8802988	8806109	Moving right along, the number four Christmas toy.
8807009	8807869	The Yu-Gi-Oh!
8807949	8809169	Trading Card Game.
8809950	8811470	I cry for America.
8812030	8815011	Okay, the concept of this whole Yu-Gi-Oh!
8815051	8815971	thing is just shit.
8816712	8815971	1991.
8817612	8824734	Card games are cool, people just love watching card games, they don't like participating in card games, but watching them are really fun.
8825396	8828900	Especially when little holographic things happen.
8829321	8829461	No.
8829481	8829922	Crap.
8829962	8833005	Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
8833045	8834427	Not to mention the thing came out in 1991.
8834467	8834767	Crap.
8834948	8835749	And crap.
8841201	8844363	Alright, so that was the number four holiday toy this year.
8844383	8845063	Oh, I'm sorry.
8845704	8847845	Wait, so, hold on.
8848766	8849446	The Yu-Gi-Oh!
8849466	8857311	trading card game, are they talking about like a pack of nine cards costs just under nine dollars?
8857471	8859472	That's what the website says.
8859572	8861533	I believe everything I read online, so.
8862434	8863334	Let's go to the next one.
8863514	8864515	Let's go to the next one.
8865336	8867937	Jamie, why don't you tell us what the number three Christmas toy is this year?
8868277	8869057	Password Journal 2.
8869477	8871598	It allows girls to keep a secret diary and cost $20.
8871678	8873478	Ooh, you can keep a secret diary.
8873498	8875098	I have a live journal.
8875438	8876279	You have a live journal.
8876339	8880900	Get your kids online and teach them how to type so they can be good little sexertaries when they get older.
8882200	8883000	Sexertaries.
8884841	8885821	A password journal.
8885861	8886961	It's not a password journal.
8887021	8889942	It's Password Journal 2 is the number three toy.
8892725	8895967	No, it's the Password Journal 2, not 2DX, it's just the Password Journal 2.
8896467	8903510	The number two Christmas toy this holiday season for little Bratz is the Bratz Funky Fashion Makeover.
8904890	8907572	It's a spin-off of the popular Bratz dolls, and it costs $25.
8907652	8909393	Yeah, those things are stupid.
8909473	8911133	I don't even know what the fuck it is.
8911153	8914575	My mom would not let me get gem dolls because she thought that their heads were too big, like crack babies.
8915575	8917896	These make the gem dolls look tame, okay?
8919397	8921338	However, the boy ones are kind of cool.
8922242	8922662	DarkSakura.com
8936972	8937412	Seriously?
8937432	8940054	That totally sounds like something they'd sell in the Castro.
8940754	8941954	How do you mean seriously?
8941974	8943715	I mean, they can't market something like that.
8943875	8945016	You can in the Castro.
8945236	8947457	He wore a ring.
8948097	8951439	It was supposed to be like a medallion, a ring around his neck on a chain.
8951499	8953060	Ring around the cocky.
8953280	8955401	And it was a cock ring.
8957482	8961043	Now, was it like magnum size or... I don't know.
8961083	8961704	I didn't have one.
8962064	8963104	Magnum size.
8963645	8964105	Next!
8964853	8968775	The number one toy this holiday season, Jamie, what is it?
8969055	8970135	A Game Boy Advance.
8970435	8970956	Yes, that's right.
8970976	8975017	If you have to ask what a Game Boy Advance is, then go back and bury your head back in the hole.
8975277	8979519	Now, obviously, we here in the room disagree with this list completely.
8979639	8985442	So we are going to give you, during this next listless segment, our top three...
8987344	8992868	Video game related things we want for Christmas or we think somebody should have for Christmas.
8993428	8997551	So it's our top three video game, video gamers Christmas list.
8998192	8998792	And we're going to do that.
8998812	9001794	We're going to take a quick break so we can prepare our list and then we'll be right back.
9001874	9005156	So listen to some music real fast.
9005176	9008739	We're going to keep this really brief because we want to get this done before the show's over.
9009840	9013022	So why don't you listen to something from...
9014119	9015683	and 2DX8style.
9016064	9018270	How about our favorite band?
9018370	9018651	Why?
9018711	9019834	Because we took their name.
9020115	9022180	Orange Lounge from 2DX8style here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9127242	9128143	Thanks for watching!
9221505	9222566	Alright, we are back.
9222726	9232110	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and now we're going to start a little thing we call listless here, and I'm trying to find our listless music, although I don't know if I have it queued up.
9233090	9235671	I might have to substitute a different game show theme because I can't find it.
9235751	9237452	I'll find it.
9237492	9238412	Do you remember where I put it?
9238592	9240633	It's one of the old pre-show things.
9240853	9242134	I have the Press Your Luck theme.
9242434	9242814	Play that.
9242954	9244115	Alright, we're going to play the Press Your Luck theme.
9244175	9244395	Okay.
9246281	9254224	Alright, list list here, it's the top holiday toys that we want and you should want for Christmas.
9254244	9258746	This is the way it works, for those of you that haven't sat in on a list list segment before, because we have some new listeners tonight.
9259487	9263968	We're going to give all of our, in the room, our top three items.
9264088	9268690	And then we're going to go around the room and take, each of us will take one item off of the list.
9268970	9272412	That's going to be hard, because we're going to be crushing someone's Christmas dream right there.
9272432	9274693	It's going to be very difficult tonight, very painful.
9277649	9280211	Yeah, we'll just eliminate all Lokis like we do every week.
9281212	9284055	And then once that's done, you guys will vote on the final list.
9284075	9288439	You'll take your vote and you'll vote on what from that list is your most desired holiday toy.
9289280	9290081	Video game related.
9290976	9292357	It doesn't have to be new, no.
9292417	9294138	Just what you want this holiday season.
9294158	9296520	Nobody will be able to afford my Christmas.
9296600	9296981	All right.
9297421	9302905	Just what you want this holiday season, and the thing that everybody should want this holiday season, because you said so, and you're God.
9303365	9303866	Okay.
9304226	9304766	Goddess.
9305087	9305587	Goddess.
9306688	9311892	All right, and then the chat room votes on the top three, and that's it.
9312892	9313813	That's the list.
9314013	9316675	There is no other list.
9316955	9317416	All right.
9318717	9320138	Let's start with Loki.
9321255	9324796	Give us your number three pick for the must-have Christmas toy for Loki this season.
9324896	9329898	I don't know why I won't say this, but I don't have it this season anymore, and I don't want it.
9330558	9331138	Power Glove!
9332058	9333639	The Power Glove!
9334599	9338200	I love the Power Glove.
9338280	9340421	Loki says everybody... Keep the Power Glove off her.
9341221	9343742	Boys and girls everywhere need the Power Glove.
9347032	9349175	Alright, let's move on.
9349215	9350536	Brad, you're number three choice.
9350637	9356564	Okay, my number three choice is the PS1 with the combination with the LCD screen.
9357205	9363452	I want this, I don't have one yet, but I think I want everybody else to get one, so I can mod it for you for a very special price, of course.
9364413	9366434	All right, a PS1 and LCD screen.
9367135	9367955	Very good choice.
9368235	9368535	Dave.
9371377	9376419	Oh, I think you said pad, because it's the only actual pad that you can play EDR on.
9376539	9379220	Unless you've got, like, some crazy mod thing.
9380681	9382642	Alright, an ignition pad says Dave.
9382742	9384263	I'll go ahead and get my number three pick.
9384664	9389126	My number three pick this holiday season, what Rob wants, I want the Sims Online.
9390367	9390747	Nerd.
9390967	9397091	Because if you think Animal Crossing is bad, just fucking wait until Sims Online, that's all I have to say.
9397872	9399032	Jamie, your number three pick.
9399453	9401174	I want the PC Engine Duo RX.
9403417	9404377	I have to explain this.
9404717	9405097	Why?
9405117	9408058	I already own a TurboGrafx Duo.
9408658	9421761	The PC Engine was what TurboGrafx was in Japan, with the advantage of having a DuoRI that has an arcade card built in, so I can actually play my copy of Strider, and, uh, um, Art, uh, not Artifighting 2, it's, uh, I think Roboutville 3.
9423621	9424481	That's fucking hardcore.
9424501	9425902	No, it's Artifighting 2, it's Artifighting 2.
9426142	9427122	Jamie, you're so hardcore.
9430373	9432654	And the other thing, I can play Sapphire.
9432694	9439036	Sapphire is such a fabulous game because it's one of the first 16-bit games that had real polygons in it.
9439096	9444098	Alright, the chatroom's suggesting, by the way, things such as a mail-order bride should be on the list.
9444118	9448900	But you guys have to remember, we're talking video game-related things, so... Video game?
9449020	9450121	Do you think a mail-order bride?
9450141	9453462	Yeah, I guess if you play video games, that's the only way you're ever going to get married, is by ordering one.
9454528	9458649	No, they can sit there and watch me play video games.
9458689	9460110	Exceptions to every rule.
9460270	9461510	Exceptions to every rule.
9462631	9463451	ITs, ITs.
9463551	9464331	All right, moving on.
9464611	9465271	Number two choice.
9466072	9477535	My number two choice, I was going to go with now the... It has the hidden cameras in the center square there, but... And I decided, no, probably shouldn't do that because I'd have no use for them.
9477775	9482317	I decided to go with the official Konami metal stages.
9482777	9483317	Two of them.
9486212	9488655	Every boy and girl wants a Konami Metal stage.
9488775	9490076	Moving right along, Brad.
9491037	9492699	A GameCube with Animal Crossing.
9492739	9492879	Matt?
9500516	9502318	It didn't happen to me with GameCube and Animal Crossing.
9502378	9504840	It happened to me with the Sega CD and Eternal Champions.
9529460	9530984	Hardcore.
9531104	9533429	All right, Dave, your number two choice.
9534672	9537017	My number two choice is a DD Rex machine.
9538829	9540570	I'm sorry, a DDR EX machine?
9540630	9540850	Yes.
9541531	9542051	What is that?
9543692	9544272	Oh, Extreme.
9544352	9544913	Oh, my bad.
9545233	9546434	Oh, I don't know the lingo yet.
9546554	9547194	I'm sorry.
9547354	9549395	I'm not down with it.
9549575	9551016	I'm not jiggy with the lingo.
9551116	9551576	My bad.
9551596	9553177	It's the new Metal Gear, DD Rex.
9553998	9554398	All right.
9555479	9560402	My number two pick for a must-have this holiday season, Kansas City Star on 9.
9560602	9564604	And you have to have the broadband, but that's a secret code.
9564644	9565044	Of course.
9565464	9566005	That's a given.
9569989	9570990	Jamie, your number two pick.
9571130	9571971	My number two pick.
9572512	9575436	It was almost my number one pick, but I had to think of my priorities.
9576056	9579981	I want a Beatmania 2DX Arcade Style Controller.
9580481	9581963	I had my chance to get one.
9582284	9583946	I had to think order, okay?
9583966	9585027	We had everything together.
9585267	9586869	Your credit card's not the right kind.
9586909	9587930	We can't accept it.
9588271	9589212	So we're canceling your order.
9589232	9589832	Oh, shit.
9592348	9594209	All right, coming on down to the number one picks.
9594229	9596710	Loki, your number one must-have gift this holiday season.
9596730	9599031	Well, since Dave took mine, I'm going to have to one-up him.
9599051	9600212	I'm going to go for a 2DX machine.
9600232	9600912	We'll go with 8th style.
9616573	9620158	Boy, you will have had to have been extra good this year for Santa to bring you one of those.
9620398	9622220	That was really good.
9622300	9623962	Or Hanukkah Harry in days past.
9624924	9626566	You stole my number one, that bitch.
9628536	9631217	All right, Dave, you're number one must-have this holiday season.
9631237	9632057	I'm sorry, Brad.
9632077	9633098	What, am I not here?
9633298	9635138	I'm looking right at you, and I called you Dave.
9635158	9637019	You make a better door than you do a window.
9637379	9640040	Um, mine, you know, this is a little, I'm a little outdated.
9640080	9643121	I want an American PS2, because I've had a JPS2 all along.
9643181	9645442	I've got a lot of American games to catch up on.
9645862	9646503	What, Matt?
9646903	9647863	Yeah, take yours back.
9647903	9648643	Yes, I can.
9648703	9649243	All right, fine.
9649284	9649604	All right.
9649684	9650344	I want a JPS2.
9650364	9650944	You want a JPS2.
9657807	9660167	Dave, you say the 2DX machine and we're all set.
9660967	9663268	Wait, actually, Loki, say the 2DX.
9663588	9664749	Okay, you say 2DX.
9665089	9669450	I say a JPS-2 with 2DX and the controller.
9671211	9671851	There we go.
9673111	9673651	Good lord.
9673731	9674772	Alright, fine.
9674892	9675832	I'm throwing a memory card.
9676472	9677012	Fair enough.
9677153	9678533	I think we have it all worked out now.
9679853	9681674	Alright, my number one pick is...
9682620	9683981	Yes, I'm trendy, so what?
9684001	9684281	Fuck you.
9684321	9685902	I'm not doing number one yet, are we?
9686082	9687784	No, okay, never mind, I'll try that one last.
9688284	9688844	Yeah, okay.
9688904	9689865	And I'll make it first.
9689885	9692407	We'll see, this time you go last.
9692547	9693087	Alright.
9693687	9696209	My number one pick, yes, I'm trendy, fuck you, Metroid Prime.
9696449	9697790	Hey, I have that game.
9699391	9700112	It's pretty.
9700492	9702854	Okay, I hate first person shooters, but this game is fabulous.
9702974	9703194	Alright.
9710939	9712340	Jamie, your number one pick, please.
9712941	9714982	Unofficial Konami Drum Mania controller, Richard.
9715463	9716363	Drum Mania.
9717484	9722428	You know, I have every other controller except the damn Drum Mania controller.
9722528	9725110	And I don't have a top of music controller, but I'm not as hyper about that.
9728293	9728733	Okay.
9728753	9733217	You can get drum controllers if you know where to look, but I need a Drum Mania controller.
9733514	9734939	Here's the list so far.
9735039	9737529	A Power Glove, a PS1 LCD screen...
9738326	9753794	Ignition Pad, The Sims Online, a PC Engine Duo RX, Konami Metal Stages, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, DDR EX, Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX Arcade Controller, Japanese PS2, American PS2, a 2DX Machine, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania Controller and Drum Mania.
9754614	9755034	Wow.
9755635	9762658	I don't know how we're going to possibly do the elimination round, but... Oh well, Christmases are about to be ruined here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9763018	9765780	I don't know how people are expecting to pay for all this shit.
9765840	9766340	I mean, like...
9767236	9768818	Everything that I picked is in excess of $200.
9769218	9775364	So, I don't know, I guess you're going to vote for the thing you least would want to see under your tree.
9775504	9779548	I have no idea how you're going to make a selection here, but just fucking do it.
9780750	9783472	Or your menorah, as the case may be.
9783933	9789899	Okay, in the back in the peanut gallery, Neal's asking... Don't you get eight days of presents, so...
9791130	9794152	So, uh, you get, like, your 2DX machine in pieces.
9794492	9795353	Here's the monitor!
9795873	9796553	Here's the key!
9797854	9799715	Actually, I got fucking gypped this Hanukkah.
9799755	9801256	All I got was DDR Max.
9801696	9809401	But, hopefully, because, like, my birthday comes, like, a day after Christmas, so normally they make up for it with better shit on my birthday.
9810101	9811722	Yeah, you got your priorities in order, you know.
9812863	9813583	Good little Jewish boy.
9813623	9815584	What the hell are you talking about?
9816785	9818386	Christmas and Hanukkah are all about presents.
9819813	9822074	Yeah, they're about... Yeah, present.
9822094	9823975	They're about Jesus or not.
9825996	9826376	Anyway.
9828737	9829498	Can we finish?
9829578	9829998	Can we finish?
9830198	9830738	Can we finish?
9830798	9831098	Alright.
9831979	9832459	Here we go.
9832579	9835901	Loki, take... Ruin someone's Christmas right now.
9836141	9837481	What don't you want for Christmas?
9838682	9842524	Well, since I don't play it at all, 2DX Machine.
9843364	9844825	Oh, 2DX Machine.
9845285	9846726	Going straight for the gut.
9846766	9849347	Just go play one at Scandia when it arrives.
9850014	9852176	He's just going to play one at Scandia whenever it arrives.
9852236	9852877	All right, Brad.
9853798	9856660	It's time for you to ruin Christmas and Hanukkah for somebody.
9856700	9857441	Just for that, Matt.
9857541	9858202	Power Glove.
9858262	9858762	Say goodbye.
9859163	9859323	Oh!
9859743	9860504	Oh, no, you didn't.
9860844	9863186	No, you did not take out the Power Glove.
9863226	9866389	I have the Power Glove, and it sucks.
9867490	9869813	The chat room will have your head for that, Brad.
9869973	9870293	Okay.
9870733	9871094	My turn?
9871194	9871734	Dave's turn.
9871895	9872495	Metal Stages.
9873056	9874177	Metal Stages.
9874437	9875218	Fuck you, Loki.
9878408	9879028	Where the hell was that?
9879068	9880210	Oh, yes, the Konami Metal Stages.
9880230	9880530	There it is.
9881772	9882092	Alright.
9883093	9889020	I would purposely go after you and take off the JPS2, but that was my number two choice.
9891383	9891783	Never mind.
9891983	9893345	That was going to be one of my choices.
9893565	9895868	My number one to come off the list...
9899198	9911044	God, I'm going to take off the PS1 LCD screen because I'm taking that off because the PS1 is so last year.
9911424	9912205	You know what?
9912845	9917187	I'm looking at this list and I own probably most of the stuff that's on it already.
9918748	9921810	You don't own an EX machine.
9923286	9924947	I said most of this stuff, not all of it.
9924987	9929710	Because I have a JPS2, an American PS2, a Metroid Prime, and a GameCube and Animal Crossing.
9930971	9931932	Toot the little horn.
9932932	9935314	And I actually have a beta of Sims Online.
9938276	9939076	Let's take off.
9942398	9944140	I prefer not to be lagged, thank you.
9959875	9962376	Jamie, why don't you read off the final list here?
9962476	9967538	Oh, wait, I've got to make sure this is copied right and not some porn site or something is going to post all over the chat room.
9967558	9968418	I've got to make sure.
9968578	9969718	Can't hide porn.
9970178	9973840	All right, why don't you read off this list, Jamie, and they can vote for it right now in the chat room.
9973860	9977201	Really, pimp tricks are for hoes.
9977221	9980122	We have an ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX.
9980522	9981302	How did that stay?
9982402	9984703	Because it's the coolest video game system ever.
9985403	9987464	You can play Dracula X on it, okay?
9988850	9998495	GameCube with Animal Crossing, DDR Extreme, Phantasy Star Online, and of course you have to have the adapter with it, 2DX Arcade style controller, it would help find connections.
9998515	10000116	Sorry.
10000156	10006179	Japanese PS2, American PS2, Metroid Prime, and Drummedia controller with Drummedia.
10006479	10007079	Fabulous.
10007759	10011381	So, a quick music break while you guys send in your votes.
10011401	10014023	You're only going to have like two minutes to send me your votes, so do it now.
10014083	10014583	Now, now, now!
10015501	10018184	You can send them in over email as well, but hurry up and do it now.
10018404	10021467	Vote for your favorite, and we will be right back.
10021487	10024149	We're going to play something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
10024170	10024330	What?
10025351	10025751	The bump?
10025811	10026852	I don't know if I have the bump queued up.
10026892	10027273	I'm sorry.
10028774	10030315	How about something from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania?
10030356	10031236	Something there?
10031316	10031737	Catch your eye?
10031817	10032337	Monkey Magic.
10032878	10033378	Monkey Magic.
10034059	10035040	And then we'll hear Kachaka.
10035801	10036862	And then we'll come right back.
10036942	10039344	So that gives you two minutes to vote here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10057781	10058382	Thank you.
10058422	10059222	Thank you.
10059242	10059663	Thank you.
10087825	10089127	Thanks for watching!
10106039	10125729	All sun and egg on the mountain top The monkey is monkey that ever spoke He knew every magic trick under the sun To tease the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic Monkey magic, monkey magic, monkey magic
10135357	10137738	Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic
10239110	10244874	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
10245275	10247496	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10247516	10248757	We're right in the middle of listless.
10252958	10259600	The topic tonight, the top thing we want most for Christmas or Hanukkah, whatever you happen to celebrate.
10259760	10268423	And if you were a little kid being sampled by the Hooligans website, the number one pick for them was a Game Boy Advance, which didn't even make our list.
10268943	10270803	So, you know it's not going to be there.
10270943	10272584	It means we probably already have one.
10273224	10274985	Once again, these were the final choices.
10275045	10287934	An ignition pad, a PC Engine Duo RX, a GameCube and Animal Crossing, a DDR Extreme machine, which is a miracle because it's not even out until next year, but I'm just going to assume you're talking about a beta.
10288954	10292937	A Phantasy Star Online, a 2DX controller arcade style.
10294123	10300906	Japanese PS2 and American PS2, Metroid Prime, and a Drum Mania controller and Drum Mania.
10300926	10302146	I just want to say it's the holidays.
10302226	10304147	Miracles happen this time around, you know.
10305167	10306508	Miracles do happen.
10306568	10306888	Thank you.
10307108	10308128	Thank you, Preachy Dave.
10309829	10310789	We appreciate that.
10311890	10316531	Okay, let's read the top ones.
10316952	10320153	I was trying to find a sound effect file, but I don't have one, so...
10325154	10334662	Boy, Ren, if you think you're happy now, wait till you hear this.
10335082	10337524	It's a record of my favorite song.
10338545	10343449	It's called Happy Happy Joy Joy.
10348021	10349943	Hello, boys and girls.
10350003	10352405	This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteek.
10352805	10359010	The number three winner, Happy Happy Joy Joy, is... A GameCube and Animal Crossing.
10359030	10364295	Yay, GameCube and Animal Crossing win.
10364335	10365075	Third place.
10365135	10366477	Second place winner is...
10368587	10371209	A 2DX arcade style controller.
10371289	10372190	Hey, that's the way it works.
10372250	10373891	Alright, and the winner of Buy a Landslide, might I add.
10373971	10376093	I don't know why, because it ain't even out yet, but hey.
10376133	10377994	Nobody gave the chatroom points for being smirks.
10395109	10395929	Just kidding.
10396509	10410253	We love our chatters and they did pick a DDR Extreme Machine as the number one must-have holiday present thing.
10412773	10417454	Also getting honorable mentions, they tried to write in, there was a write-in candidate for Sky's Voice the Game.
10418274	10420115	I have no idea how that would be played.
10422332	10423453	I have no idea how that works.
10423473	10426774	If we're going video game related with the Mail Order Bride, would it be like Ping from Megatokyo?
10426794	10427214	I don't know.
10427294	10427554	What?
10429155	10431916	People who read Megatokyo, Ping is a PS2 accessory.
10434057	10436658	A life-size human PS2 accessory for dating sims.
10436998	10440659	Sky's voice, the game, did not garner enough votes.
10440779	10443160	It doesn't count because it wasn't on our list.
10444061	10444481	Sheesh.
10445618	10447318	Yeah, deal with it.
10447499	10449579	We'll do another list list for my voice later.
10449599	10451039	Every day is a game with Rob.
10451540	10455701	Oh, they're saying that Skye's voice the game would be like Parappa the game.
10456661	10458301	Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.
10459482	10463623	Or something, like my... In the rain or in the snow, I got the funky flow.
10464143	10466304	That means he has to pee.
10466644	10469725	He got the funky flow from eating too much beans.
10470165	10470985	Oh, dear good lord.
10472296	10474399	Alright, it's about time to end the show.
10474579	10476341	Believe it or not, we've made it for three hours.
10476802	10478804	Oh, shit, we've got to do Loki's sim update.
10478844	10479325	My bad.
10479866	10480386	My bad.
10480546	10481588	Way to go there, Rob.
10482068	10483911	Ah, shit, I thought we could get through one show without it.
10483971	10484712	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10484812	10486093	Yes, give us your sim update, Loki.
10486133	10486574	Make it quick.
10487215	10487956	Not too much going on.
10487976	10490899	We've got DWI, new version now, I believe they're up in LA.
10491440	10493321	3Tubers, I don't know who cares, it doesn't really matter.
10493781	10498462	Um, the whole point is that they have karaoke now, um, is the lyrics.
10498922	10501943	You know, from 3rd Mix you were talking about earlier, that is now featured in EGWI.
10501963	10502723	Oh, shit.
10503563	10507265	And so people are actually, you know, making lyrics for songs and that wonderful stuff.
10507665	10513386	And also they have the audition for special characters, you know, like the hearts and Japanese characters and stuff.
10513886	10515507	They have that available now free to...
10516241	10517042	So go check that out.
10517482	10527031	Also, for all you Bomani Ruler DWI fans out there, on DDRmaniaX, you'll probably see a post in the user-submitted files saying something about a share.
10528027	10528648	DWI.
10528788	10529468	Well, guess what?
10529488	10530269	That's not shared.
10530329	10531390	That is the return.
10531430	10540096	The last final Bimani Ruler unreleased track that you need to go download because it's supposed to be good, but I tried it and it's just four-key beat mania.
10540156	10542758	But anyways, have fun with that.
10543198	10549283	So yeah, also Tourney Mix 3 is going to be, you know, enter that if you haven't yet and it'll be fun.
10549783	10551965	They should be posting up files probably at the end of December.
10552065	10553407	How about MakeEditGetPorn?
10553447	10554829	Give us an update on MakeEditGetPorn.
10554889	10557493	Well, I haven't really come up with a date yet.
10557613	10560457	I'm acquiring more stuff to go in the boxes.
10560797	10564542	Yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on there.
10564863	10566285	I'll announce a date when we do have one.
10567686	10586698	Um, aside from that, really not too much going on, just, um, check out DDRUK, do donate the money, because they're kind of short on money, but they do have, uh, you know, the Dancing Stage Party Edition files up, and also, um, you know, pretty much almost everything else, official-wise, so, go check it out, they have six sets for you to download, so, yeah, that's it.
10587179	10596665	Oh, oh, oh, and one more thing, now, it's my understanding, you know, I'm not really sure about the Naoki Journal, because I can't read Japanese, but I believe that this is the last one.
10598001	10598582	Wah!
10598782	10599503	I cried.
10600404	10600844	Next.
10601145	10601565	That's it.
10603847	10607051	Jamie, oh yeah, I guess it's that time to give our final thoughts of the night.
10607071	10607351	Jamie?
10608172	10609313	Um, just one little thing.
10609774	10612997	I got BMX XXX for free, and it sucks.
10613558	10615640	But you can pick up the hoe and take her to her pimp.
10616882	10617302	That's all.
10617682	10618904	And for that, it's worth buying.
10620353	10621833	Loki's worth getting it for free.
10622554	10624274	Loki, your final thought, please.
10624514	10627555	If you get Sci-Fi, tomorrow night at 9 p.m.
10627735	10632836	is the first of ten two-hour-long mini-movies of Taken.
10633297	10634797	It's one of the most awesome series.
10635177	10639618	It's produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by ten different people.
10639938	10641039	It's going to be really awesome.
10641459	10642339	Definitely check it out.
10643619	10644019	All right.
10644700	10645200	Will do.
10645340	10646040	Just for you, Loki.
10646877	10649338	Okay, um, I just found my Koosh thing.
10649398	10650338	Dave, yes, you found it.
10650398	10662121	Yeah, I've had it, like, I brought it over here, I think, two months ago, and left it here, and I was wondering where it was, and then, hey, that guy, I forget his name, was playing with it.
10662161	10662861	That guy Brad?
10663282	10663542	No.
10663602	10666682	That guy Brad, or that guy, uh, uh, Neil?
10666963	10667223	Yeah.
10667383	10667603	Yes.
10668363	10668783	Yeah, him.
10669083	10673724	Yeah, alright, people in my house that don't participate in Orange Lounge because they don't get the DDR thing.
10674505	10674805	Yep.
10675245	10675505	Okay.
10675525	10675665	Yeah.
10676394	10678976	Oh, I got 97.5 on nearly 130.
10679356	10680417	Yay, for me.
10680777	10681858	Ah, still haven't beat me yet.
10682338	10682698	What's you?
10683198	10683679	What are you at?
10683699	10685220	I'm at like 98-something, I don't know.
10685480	10685820	What?
10686000	10686340	I don't know.
10686761	10687942	On the RVGL machine?
10688362	10689483	No, not on the RVGL machine.
10689503	10690563	Is that a second place?
10690623	10691544	Check the Scandi one.
10692064	10692745	Check the Scandi one.
10693205	10694266	Oh, I will beat it.
10695738	10697218	I know, but the second player side works.
10697379	10699519	Anyway, who cares about the stomping game?
10699559	10700339	Penis, penis, penis.
10700519	10702680	Alright, Bradley, your final thought, please.
10703100	10706721	That thing is a copy of an aero-beat that I used to have on those things.
10706941	10707581	An aero-beat?
10707801	10709722	Yeah, it was like, harder than that.
10709742	10713043	Supposed to be a thing you could throw the farthest.
10713103	10716064	Yeah, because now toys are supposed to be non-lethal.
10716084	10716404	Yeah.
10717064	10722826	Well, anyway, now that the show is over, the streets are now, once again, safe for Bimani.
10722846	10724006	Hooray!
10726460	10727602	Whoa to the Republic.
10728243	10731027	My final thought is that my voice is not high and funny.
10731668	10732910	It is deep and sexy.
10732970	10733831	It's high in fiber.
10735121	10738205	and I need to get... Rob's voice is high in fiber and fortified with vitamins.
10738365	10739206	And I need to get laid.
10739666	10740708	And that's it.
10740848	10741368	Whale!
10742469	10743270	Wasn't that special?
10743290	10744792	I really, really, really need to get laid.
10744832	10745213	That's it.
10745293	10745613	Good night.
10746154	10746754	See you next week.
10747495	10748937	Remember, we're pre-taped next week.
