00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:03,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:04,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:09,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:16,319
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:22,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:26,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:29,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:34,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:36,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:36,985
[SPEAKER_04]: In this episode...

12
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, any balls down there?

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,485
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.

14
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:49,747
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your favorite scary movie?

15
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:50,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

16
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:52,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely frightful.

17
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:53,229
[SPEAKER_12]: What's yours?

18
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,950
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't torture yourself.

20
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,731
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my job.

21
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!

22
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get you, my pretty.

23
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And your little dog, too.

24
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:06,655
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Kung Fu.

25
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:09,617
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

26
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:11,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Why did they have to take the word gay...

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,662
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

28
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:38,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the bush baby.

29
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello also to our third wheel.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our tech master, Loki.

31
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:10,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everybody.

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in studio tonight, we have another few guests to say hello to.

33
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:18,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody say hello to... Who's got a microphone?

34
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:19,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Bradley over there.

35
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:20,575
[SPEAKER_27]: Yo.

36
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:21,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

37
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, my brother?

38
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:30,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in studio, say hello to... Is it Jenny's bitch or is it Jamie's bitch?

39
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know, but the initials are JB.

40
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:32,062
[SPEAKER_04]: JB.

41
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:35,933
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you want to say is hello?

42
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:36,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Moo.

43
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:37,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Moo, okay.

44
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,578
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be talking to everybody more a bit later.

45
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,360
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to take a really quick break.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other opening thoughts from you folks here?

47
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't think the parrot noises pick up very well over the radio, actually.

48
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:52,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

49
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,030
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear a little bit of it?

50
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I don't listen to the show.

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a brand.

52
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:01,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh.

53
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you know what?

54
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody who listens at home, give me food.

55
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: You want food right now.

56
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you craving before the show started?

57
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:09,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Artichoke hearts.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a pizza with garlic sauce and artichoke hearts.

59
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a PMS thing?

60
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, bite me.

61
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be right back after this very quick break.

62
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like our listeners to know that Robin's eating balls.

63
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:53,509
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big and fluffy.

64
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get into the next song, I'd like to make a real quick announcement.

65
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of tease our next segment.

66
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:42,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob was eating balls.

67
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other than that, I was eating balls.

68
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:52,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to announce that after these next two songs, when we come back to the next segment, I'm going to come out live on air.

69
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:58,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for me to come out of the closet, and I will be doing that live on air just after this next break.

70
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:04,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just, you know, this is going to be historic radio right here.

71
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to let you all know.

72
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:38,650
[SPEAKER_10]: You and I, in a little toy shop, buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got Set them free at the break of dawn, till one by one, they were gone Back of phase, box in the software, flash the message, something's out there Floating in the summer sky, 99, every day

73
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:39,533
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 dreams I have had, everyone a red balloon It's all over and I'm standing pretty, in this dust that was a city If I could find a souvenir, just to prove the world was here And here is a red balloon, I'll think of you and let it go

74
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:42,630
[SPEAKER_18]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

75
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,300
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

76
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:59,845
[SPEAKER_04]: As we promised during the last break, it's time for me to stop hiding secrets from everyone here assembled in the room and all those assembled in the chat room.

77
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:02,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to stop lying to myself about some things.

78
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit this live on air.

79
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I like something that a lot of people say I shouldn't like.

80
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:30,627
[SPEAKER_04]: and people are telling me it's wrong that I feel this way and that I like these kinds of things, but I have to say, you guys, I just can't get enough of it.

81
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do like Politary's dive from Six Style.

82
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,713
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I said it.

83
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:43,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I'm so sorry, mom and dad.

84
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,663
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so sorry.

85
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:49,004
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate her.

86
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,166
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish she would burn in hell.

87
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,690
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, it still holds true, okay?

88
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know that all Apolitary fans are going to burn in hell.

89
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you to judge?

90
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:01,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't judge me.

91
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:02,415
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't know me.

92
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,418
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still holding a bounty for her dead.

93
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,342
[SPEAKER_26]: Bring her head to me and you'll be paid with vast riches of the lands.

94
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:12,724
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't know shit.

95
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:15,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there.

96
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel much better now that I've come out on radio.

97
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so invigorating.

98
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

99
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

100
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,416
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you're not.

101
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:28,817
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.

102
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 21.

103
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:32,939
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to All Apolitary all the time.

104
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:35,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Before your ears bleed.

105
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And that does make me sad.

106
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,162
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me sad.

107
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sorry, that is the best version of Dive.

108
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:57,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Go have a cry.

109
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:58,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I will have a cry.

110
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:00,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go have a cry.

111
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,288
[SPEAKER_17]: The B4U girls can sing better than her.

112
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:03,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

113
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

114
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,950
[SPEAKER_17]: She cannot hold a key.

115
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither can the B4U.

116
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:09,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can.

117
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would make Super Eurobeat that much better.

118
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:15,531
[SPEAKER_26]: That's my impression of B4U.

119
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:18,594
[SPEAKER_26]: Hyper Eurobeat, Super Eurobeat.

120
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,536
[SPEAKER_26]: It's got B4U and Politary.

121
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,118
[SPEAKER_26]: What more evil do you need?

122
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:29,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, are you going to say that to Mike?

123
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:30,307
[SPEAKER_04]: JB's afraid of microphones.

124
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to hear very much from him this show.

125
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:32,850
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing here?

126
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:38,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I was playing Dive just the other day on 2DX and I was like, you know what?

127
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this song and the hell with the rest of you.

128
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like Politary either, but, you know, everybody's allowed one odd thing.

129
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:50,353
[SPEAKER_17]: She needs to have a hello again moment.

130
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:51,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Choke on a chicken ball.

131
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,035
[SPEAKER_17]: And die!

132
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:56,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are so mean.

133
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:58,337
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're not.

134
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,098
[SPEAKER_17]: We're being honest.

135
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Totally so.

136
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,369
[SPEAKER_17]: The show is sponsored by Propel

137
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:21,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, sim update.

138
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:22,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we can do that.

139
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:27,091
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, obviously the most prominent thing going on right now is Herney Mix 3.

140
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:32,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Entries are actually being accepted right now and until December 20th, so get your stuff in there.

141
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:42,007
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I actually played Step Mania for the first time outside of your simulator, because I've played your simulator at various parties that you've been at and you brought it to.

142
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:47,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of your simulator, I actually sat down, I downloaded Stepmania, and I actually played it for the first time in I don't know how long.

143
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know what?

144
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty damn cool.

145
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I've been missing out on.

146
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:52,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

147
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:54,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um... Okay.

148
00:14:55,097 --> 00:15:02,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, yeah, actually, one of the things that's going to be coming up pretty soon in some of the updates for Setmania is support for Beatmania.

149
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:05,269
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's going to be good.

150
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:10,735
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're going to see support for Beatmania probably soon after will be Dance Maniacs and Poppin' Music.

151
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,018
[SPEAKER_26]: And they'll be the all-encompassing Bimani Sim.

152
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:13,999
[SPEAKER_17]: The word for that?

153
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:14,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Squee!

154
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:18,120
[SPEAKER_26]: So, look for that soon.

155
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Other things that should be noted, visit DDRUK.

156
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:26,126
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they've got tons of sync sets that they're releasing now.

157
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
[SPEAKER_26]: They have pretty much everything.

158
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:32,252
[SPEAKER_26]: They're doing some of the older 1 through 5 mix stuff, so go check that out.

159
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:38,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, check out, I believe, in the DDR Maniacs chatroom, they're going to be hosting files.

160
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:42,660
[SPEAKER_26]: They have 1zip, that's all the Monty Ruler stuff that he released in 2002.

161
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they love us there, right?

162
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,625
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember that right?

163
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:49,145
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, they love us there.

164
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Big fans!

165
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:51,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Big fans.

166
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:52,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, big, big, huge fans.

167
00:15:53,306 --> 00:16:04,429
[SPEAKER_26]: So, just go check that out, because they've got, you know, his, all of his stuff for 2002, including the unreleased stuff, which I have, it's supposed to be in there in one huge zip, 111 megs, I believe.

168
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:05,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, this is Bomani Roller?

169
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomani Roller.

170
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you didn't give a shit about that stuff.

171
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit.

172
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you just ranted a couple weeks ago about the whole diva thing.

173
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about his stuff, but other people might.

174
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:13,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people might.

175
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:14,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

176
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:15,954
[SPEAKER_26]: So, there's that.

177
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:23,477
[SPEAKER_26]: Also out there floating around somewhere is the DDR Extreme skin for Step Mania, so go find that somewhere.

178
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,800
[SPEAKER_26]: It's supposed to be, I guess... It's out there somewhere.

179
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,661
[SPEAKER_26]: It's out there somewhere.

180
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:27,382
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know where.

181
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:28,563
[SPEAKER_26]: Just go check that out.

182
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:33,769
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, Tourney Mix 3 for sure is going to be... Definitely keep your eye on that.

183
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:39,777
[SPEAKER_26]: They've got a bunch of categories, including one now that you actually have to pay to get into for those people that are really professional at making files.

184
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually considering entering.

185
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure yet.

186
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you saw that I did my very first step file.

187
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:47,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

188
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:48,493
[SPEAKER_04]: My very first one.

189
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to see it.

190
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:50,394
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what's sad?

191
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:51,394
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, let's just put it this way.

192
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,336
[SPEAKER_26]: I have to say your step file is the most synced step file I've ever seen.

193
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:55,977
[SPEAKER_26]: Every time I play that, I get triple A.

194
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's a good thing

195
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:34,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like the guy who wrote it is Raiden, I thought it was always spelled the other way around, but the real name is Steven Unfred, wrote this file about how to sync a DWI, well actually he's talking about DWI, not Stepmania, but it was very helpful for me to sync this file that I did.

196
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:43,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, you know, you had to go into Gold Wave, you had to count the beats and do a little math, but this thing kind of walks you through it, the logic and everything, and it was very helpful.

197
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So props to this guy for writing the file, because that really helped me in syncing that.

198
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,200
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, really sync.

199
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I will copy, yes, for those of you in our chat room, and if you're not in our chat room, why the hell aren't you?

200
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:58,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get your booty on over to orangelounge.skie.cx, and then just click on chat.

201
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:03,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that'll get you in our chat room, and for those in the chat room, I posted the link right there.

202
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,743
[SPEAKER_17]: And aren't you lucky you're there.

203
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,035
[SPEAKER_26]: See, other stuff that's going on right now.

204
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:15,742
[SPEAKER_26]: See, well, it's not really, I guess, simulator related, but it is a pretty big thing.

205
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,285
[SPEAKER_26]: DDRspot.com is relaunched.

206
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,369
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, we'll definitely go check that out.

207
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:23,771
[SPEAKER_26]: The site is beautiful.

208
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,574
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk a little more about that stuff later.

209
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:27,295
[SPEAKER_26]: And finally...

210
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:42,206
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know how to exactly describe this, but DDRPC character set 9 is released in... Okay, just spit it out, Loki.

211
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:46,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Two new characters is Betty and Mr. Spanky.

212
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,689
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Spanky, the DDR guy.

213
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,570
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Spanky, the bondage queen.

214
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,571
[SPEAKER_26]: This guy, I mean, what the hell are they thinking?

215
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:57,603
[SPEAKER_26]: What is this?

216
00:18:57,824 --> 00:19:01,846
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they've got this guy who's like, he's in all leather, like straps, okay?

217
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:06,510
[SPEAKER_26]: He's got a mohawk and big, like, huge lips full of lipstick.

218
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,730
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Spanky.

219
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,253
[SPEAKER_26]: And then you've got the chick, she's in all, like, leather and stuff with, like, horns in her hair.

220
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:14,235
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that's some scary shit.

221
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find the DDRPC site right now so we can bring it up.

222
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,698
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, what kind of sick fucks work at Konami of America?

223
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:20,699
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all I gotta say.

224
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,321
[SPEAKER_26]: Really sick people there.

225
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find the DDR.

226
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:26,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, you guys.

227
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:26,863
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

228
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:28,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Dance Revolution product site.

229
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:30,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And downloads.

230
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And character downloads, because that's all they actually released.

231
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:37,288
[SPEAKER_04]: They were too lazy to release songs.

232
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

233
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Jason Enos and Mr. Spanky.

234
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,004
[SPEAKER_04]: The white man always smiting out the black man.

235
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:46,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice that?

236
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:47,527
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at that.

237
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:56,617
[SPEAKER_26]: They also edited set number seven to remove the skull from Robbie and put this stupid, like, I don't even know what kind of head it is.

238
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they do that?

239
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to edit the skull thing, but yet they have Mr. Spanky.

240
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:08,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we know where their focus lies in freaking Bondage Freaks.

241
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those aren't the first ones that they've released that were Bondage Freaks.

242
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,573
[SPEAKER_26]: You've got Kobe and Nikki who look pretty Kobe-ish.

243
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:21,358
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, it's a sad day, but I don't know.

244
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,259
[SPEAKER_26]: What can you do?

245
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:22,579
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean...

246
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:25,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll talk to Mr. Spanky later in the program.

247
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Mr. Spanky can offer us some advice.

248
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:33,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mr. Spanky's a big fan of Orange Lounge Radio, actually, from what I hear.

249
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll talk to Mr. Spanky a little bit later.

250
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:41,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Mr. Spanky will just kind of pop in during one of our breaks and offer you all some good advice.

251
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Lord knows a lot of you nerds out there could use it.

252
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:51,375
[SPEAKER_26]: Back on the subject of Tourney Mix 3, Rob's file there, he sent it over to me, and I decided to go ahead and do a background for him.

253
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,076
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually like it.

254
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:53,956
[SPEAKER_26]: It looks pretty cool.

255
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,037
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very colorful now.

256
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:55,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

257
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,177
[SPEAKER_04]: The background for your song.

258
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

259
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You did a very excellent job with that background.

260
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:05,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll actually play the song I did in Etitude starting the next break, so everybody can hear it.

261
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still working on it.

262
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm not entering Tourney Mix 3 with that.

263
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still debating if I even want to enter it at all, because I'm shy.

264
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:14,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Do it anyways, just do it in light if you're going to do it.

265
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,663
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that's cool.

266
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:18,243
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm entering mine in Alien World.

267
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:20,584
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm working on the subs actually right now.

268
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:21,964
[SPEAKER_26]: So, it'll be cool.

269
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:22,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

270
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:24,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking at something pretty, Jamie?

271
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:28,185
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a piece of lint floating in the air and I cut it.

272
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,426
[SPEAKER_04]: You really care about the Sim update, don't you?

273
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:33,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah.

274
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I, the, what, the Sims?

275
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:37,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you talking about Animal Crossing?

276
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:38,497
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

277
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:43,098
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, I'll be announcing this later on, something that has to do with my sim.

278
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:49,460
[SPEAKER_26]: And a further evolution of my sim, we'll get into that later on.

279
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so, sim stuff.

280
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you are going to be entering Tournament Mix 3.

281
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm debating it.

282
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:01,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie doesn't really play the sim, so you probably won't be entering Tournament Mix 3.

283
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:03,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Gatchamanota

284
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:30,422
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you could do a dance file to Schlagwerk, because nobody's ever done one.

285
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:31,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

286
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:33,064
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

287
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:36,287
[SPEAKER_26]: Both the Terror and the regular one.

288
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:37,868
[SPEAKER_17]: My bad, my bad.

289
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:42,612
[SPEAKER_17]: I would pick one of the old, like the Mega Ranger theme song, if I had to.

290
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:47,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a new person in our chat room that says that they also have this ferret.

291
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:52,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Brack2000 also owns the infamous ferret that we like to play here on the show.

292
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie likes to stroke it here on the show.

293
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, JB?

294
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:56,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Bush Baby.

295
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Bush Baby.

296
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,940
[SPEAKER_17]: It just had a fun time.

297
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you'd want to hear that wonderful news that Bush Baby has a twin.

298
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Bush Baby has a twin.

299
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:08,342
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Robzo.

300
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:09,442
[SPEAKER_17]: I just play with it.

301
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:10,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a present.

302
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,342
[SPEAKER_17]: I also ended up in somebody's lap here while he was quite drunk.

303
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:16,723
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

304
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:17,504
[SPEAKER_17]: No, what?

305
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:17,745
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

306
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:17,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

307
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:27,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do another drunk show.

308
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:28,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to.

309
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:30,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're going to have to pre-tape a show.

310
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:34,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking we ought to pre-tape a drunk show at some point.

311
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,270
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds like a winner.

312
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a winner because I'm actually going to be gone the week between Christmas and New Year's.

313
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:42,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll probably do some kind of pre-tape drunk show.

314
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:45,034
[SPEAKER_04]: What more appropriate time than the holidays to be doing a drunk show?

315
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:45,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, right.

316
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:48,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

317
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

318
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:51,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

319
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,446
[SPEAKER_17]: That's nice, twin.

320
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:56,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

321
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:57,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

322
00:23:58,289 --> 00:23:58,970
[SPEAKER_04]: You're special.

323
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Go shave your hands.

324
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

325
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:05,904
[SPEAKER_04]: What else should we talk about here?

326
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:09,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about... No, we're not going to talk about J-Rom.

327
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:23,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about... Since this kind of goes along with the whole Sim thing, and Loki was alluding to this a little bit ago, there's a brand new version of DDR out there that you may not have heard of.

328
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not official.

329
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite a bootleg.

330
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know you all out there have always wanted to dance to Britney Spears.

331
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:36,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've always wanted to dance to Eminem and Christina Aguilera.

332
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel sorry for you people.

333
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, tell us more about DDR Top Hits.

334
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:45,149
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a piece of crap that they, you know, made very...

335
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:46,837
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

336
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,419
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't really put much work into it, it looks like.

337
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,981
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically a hacked fourth mix upgrade that they made, and it's crap.

338
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:57,983
[SPEAKER_26]: They just replaced the images and replaced the songs.

339
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,304
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't even look like they even touched the steps at all.

340
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,305
[SPEAKER_26]: So, it's a piece of crap.

341
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:05,106
[SPEAKER_26]: It's got, like, Christina Aguilera in it, Britney Spears.

342
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:06,267
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes it a piece of crap instantly.

343
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,008
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just sad.

344
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:10,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Very, very sad.

345
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I see No Doubt.

346
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that's old school No Doubt or new school No Doubt.

347
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:14,431
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

348
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:17,495
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

349
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:18,436
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows?

350
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:19,076
[SPEAKER_26]: Who cares?

351
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:21,197
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just, it's crap.

352
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:41,123
[SPEAKER_26]: It's, what they, now, on the actual website, ddrtophits.com, you can actually see they have screenshots there, and if you look really closely on one of them where it shows the song selection screen, you'll actually see one of the songs that's, I believe, Boyz by Britney Spears, it says 1-2-3-4-0-0-7 as the actual song title.

353
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:46,547
[SPEAKER_26]: because they're dumbasses and don't know actually how to hack the stupid thing.

354
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:48,588
[SPEAKER_22]: It says boys.

355
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also has the Dance Mania banner, might I add.

356
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:56,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So doesn't this look like a bad Photoshop job to anybody else?

357
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:01,109
[SPEAKER_26]: No, actually, that's what I was alluding to earlier.

358
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:14,261
[SPEAKER_26]: I was talking with our fellow DDR tech guy, Keith, down in Scandia, and they were actually, sadly enough, talking about upgrading their fourth mix to this piece of shit.

359
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,043
[SPEAKER_26]: So I talked them out of it.

360
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,744
[SPEAKER_26]: I was like, I was like, I thought, hell no.

361
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:35,667
[SPEAKER_26]: So what we're going to do, and actually next week, Keith is making me copies of the Flash ROM, the game CD and the install CD, and I'm going to hack a Max 2 machine, and we're going to make my own custom mix in the arcade.

362
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how pompous and cocky of you to be saying that you're going to be able to accomplish this.

363
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:42,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really think you're going to be able to get in there and hack all the data?

364
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:43,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Why hasn't it been done yet?

365
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,270
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's possible to do, why hasn't somebody else done it yet?

366
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Why haven't the Japs done it?

367
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,571
[SPEAKER_04]: The Japs always do it first.

368
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:54,632
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, for one, over here in America, all these machines are illegal.

369
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:58,113
[SPEAKER_26]: So really, there's nothing they can do about the fact that I hacked a fucking machine.

370
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:58,873
[SPEAKER_26]: What are they going to say?

371
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,894
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, this music's not supposed to be on here.

372
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,434
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, because it's not licensed.

373
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,596
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, neither is any of the music that's on any of the import machines, so there's nothing really they can do.

374
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:07,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Suck my dick!

375
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,416
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly.

376
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,877
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's nothing that they can really do as far as that.

377
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:16,160
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, hacking a machine is slightly complicated, but it can be done.

378
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,501
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, there's a song you should put on there.

379
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,063
[SPEAKER_26]: Why you gotta go and make things so complicated?

380
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:21,043
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

381
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:21,624
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways.

382
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:22,905
[SPEAKER_26]: But it can be done.

383
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,825
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, look right here.

384
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:27,507
[SPEAKER_26]: We can definitely see that images and music is a piece of cake to do.

385
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:33,191
[SPEAKER_26]: And the actual game data itself, the actual program, is only like 30 megs.

386
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,072
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all on a flash ROM.

387
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:36,653
[SPEAKER_26]: A flash card, actually.

388
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:38,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Just a normal 32 meg flash card.

389
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:40,155
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's pretty easy.

390
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:44,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, he's also having a few friends of his who are, you know, crackers and that kind of stuff.

391
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:46,678
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, I'm not talking about white guys.

392
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:50,080
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm talking about actually people that crack software.

393
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,621
[SPEAKER_26]: They're going to be, you know, doing the same thing.

394
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:54,502
[SPEAKER_26]: So, no looking at it.

395
00:27:54,682 --> 00:28:02,825
[SPEAKER_26]: I really think it shouldn't be too hard since, you know, my knowledge of making edits and that kind of stuff and actually working with just reverse engineering all this shit to do it.

396
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:03,926
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, it will take time.

397
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:12,852
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to actually look at the game CD and stuff to figure out how the stuff's stored and that kind of junk, but I think we can do it.

398
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:14,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is your new project?

399
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:15,274
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my new project.

400
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Your new time waster.

401
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,375
[SPEAKER_26]: My new time waster, yes.

402
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:24,020
[SPEAKER_26]: But at the same time, other cool stuff that I'll be able to do with these game CDs that he's given me is rip all the videos for Mac 2.

403
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:29,244
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone's been trying to do that, ripping the videos off of DDR USA, but I'm actually just going to rip them off of Mac 2.

404
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:33,087
[SPEAKER_26]: What I'm planning to do is actually reskin the whole thing

405
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:34,909
[SPEAKER_26]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

406
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:03,293
[SPEAKER_26]: We were just throwing around a bunch of ideas because actually, for instance, people would think, okay, there's limitations on what you can put on one of those things since it's all stored on CD.

407
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:10,596
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, not exactly because you can replace the CD-ROM drives with hard drives and then you can just stick, oh, look, 120 gigs worth of stuff on there.

408
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:13,717
[SPEAKER_26]: You can actually have a DDR mix with everything on it.

409
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:15,638
[SPEAKER_26]: So it can be done.

410
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:17,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki makes Konami cry.

411
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,561
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

412
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:29,723
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, see, Konami would be the only one to get pissed about this stuff, or the RIA, but then all they'd have to do is they'd have to remove every machine in the United States, which... So you could possibly be fucking it up for everybody.

413
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:31,089
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

414
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:31,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

415
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:31,990
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello.

416
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,730
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm fucking up for everybody.

417
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,052
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not selling my fucking mix on the internet for $1,495.

418
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:40,032
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm not selling.

419
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:41,873
[SPEAKER_26]: This is going to be exclusive to Scandia.

420
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:42,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay?

421
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,634
[SPEAKER_26]: This is exclusive to Scandia.

422
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:50,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's only going to be one... So if you're out there listening to me, you know exactly where to come and arrest Loki.

423
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:51,957
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, okay.

424
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:55,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Just because I make the thing doesn't mean I'm responsible for it.

425
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:58,179
[SPEAKER_26]: That's like trying to sue the gun manufacturer for a murder.

426
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:58,539
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean...

427
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:05,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Just because I make it doesn't mean I'm assuming the risk for actually running it in an actual arcade.

428
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:09,380
[SPEAKER_26]: This is all scandia, so if things go down, they're going down, not me.

429
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to ruin DDR.

430
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:13,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to ruin DDR.

431
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:14,984
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but guess what?

432
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:19,646
[SPEAKER_26]: Another thing is I will be able to get copies of all these game CDs and stuff.

433
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:23,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I have the hookups, basically.

434
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,590
[SPEAKER_26]: And so right when we get extreme, too, same thing with that.

435
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:27,311
[SPEAKER_26]: So...

436
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:30,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I need to figure out now the really tough thing.

437
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,118
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell do I put in it?

438
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:33,825
[SPEAKER_04]: You should just copy your sim over.

439
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:35,616
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of shit.

440
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,677
[SPEAKER_26]: No, screw that.

441
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll advise you on what songs need to be in there.

442
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,921
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, but here's another thing that we're also going to, since it is going to be a Max 2 machine, I'm going to have unlocks in there.

443
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:46,682
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to tell anyone what's going to be unlocked.

444
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:47,523
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me put it this way.

445
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:50,145
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be a lot of points, a lot of songs unlocked each time.

446
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,446
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to have also custom monies.

447
00:30:52,666 --> 00:31:01,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe, I'm thinking, you know, what it's looking like is probably going to be DDR USA stuff, or Max USA stuff, I should say, and Euromix 2 and Euromix 1 stuff.

448
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,712
[SPEAKER_26]: and Jenny Rome, I guess, and Beat Mania.

449
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:06,812
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I mean, I can talk, you know, this stuff.

450
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,733
[SPEAKER_26]: I have to actually get into looking at it.

451
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but the first step you've got to figure out, you've got to be able to replace, like, at first you've got to go, like, you start little baby steps.

452
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:15,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to replace one song.

453
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:17,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see if I can replace one song.

454
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:19,276
[SPEAKER_17]: We need DDR 2DX style.

455
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:20,897
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be cool.

456
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:25,498
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to go, and then he'll go and start ripping the 2DX discs.

457
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:26,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be his next project.

458
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:31,800
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I mean, it sounds like a major undertaking, but I think if I can pull it off,

459
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:38,680
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than the fact that it'd be really cool because we'd be the only arcade in the United States that have custom mix.

460
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, decent question from the chatroom.

461
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,724
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can hack an arcade version, why haven't you hacked a PlayStation version yet?

462
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:46,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Dreamcast version?

463
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,521
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't even tried.

464
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:50,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, here's the thing.

465
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,125
[SPEAKER_17]: People have hacked the Dreamcast version, by the way.

466
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:56,328
[SPEAKER_26]: And actually, they're a little different from each other.

467
00:31:56,588 --> 00:32:01,813
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, the arcade versions, they actually store the music on a CD a little bit different than they would, you know, an actual...

468
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:06,495
[SPEAKER_26]: The arcade versions and the PlayStation versions are, like I said, very different.

469
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:10,876
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a lot of things you can change on an arcade version that you can't change on a PlayStation version.

470
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:14,097
[SPEAKER_26]: I just think just the way they store the data is going to be a little different, too.

471
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:19,279
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure, I guess we could try hacking a PlayStation version, but I'd rather do the arcade.

472
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,281
[SPEAKER_17]: The Dreamcast ones will be easier to do though because it's more compatible with the Windows environment.

473
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's Windows CE.

474
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:29,643
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they're not running Windows CE, but they're more compatible.

475
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:41,228
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing about Dreamcast games is that they're not running in Windows CE unless they boot up Windows CE at the beginning of the game because it's actually loading Windows onto the Dreamcast every time you boot the game.

476
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,559
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but I don't know.

477
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:44,620
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to look at it.

478
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,522
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll see how feasible it is.

479
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:51,748
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm getting copies of 4th Mixed Stuff and Max 2, so we'll go from there.

480
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like fun.

481
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:57,454
[SPEAKER_04]: All I ask, you need to put... Oh, Nick, please not so quick back in DVR.

482
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.

483
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:02,960
[SPEAKER_26]: I was going to bring back everything, including Telephone Operator, because I love that song, and they didn't bring it back, so...

484
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:06,109
[SPEAKER_17]: I like it just because it's a lot like the original.

485
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:25,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay?

486
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:27,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie has a medical emergency.

487
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,700
[SPEAKER_26]: But, yeah, that's an idea.

488
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:36,342
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we'll see how hard it is, and when I get done with it, you know, we'll see.

489
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:37,843
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it can be done.

490
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,404
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think it's going to be too difficult.

491
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:40,604
[SPEAKER_26]: These idiots can make one.

492
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:49,427
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, obviously, they didn't go into great detail of actually hacking the program and changing some of the steps or anything, but, you know, never know.

493
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:50,508
[SPEAKER_26]: It shouldn't be too difficult.

494
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we're looking... Are you going to be okay there, Jim?

495
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:55,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

496
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:56,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Bike it in!

497
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:57,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

498
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:02,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else... What do you guys... The other folks here in the chatroom, what do you guys think... Or the... Not in the chatroom.

499
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:04,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if chatroom wants to share too, that's fine.

500
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you guys here in the room think about this DDR Top Hits?

501
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:10,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Your guys' opinions.

502
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:10,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

503
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:12,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me want to throw up.

504
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,519
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to suck.

505
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:15,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the fucking banner for just the beginning there.

506
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like blue.

507
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,821
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably don't have any artists.

508
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:20,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably a bunch of programming nerds.

509
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:21,843
[SPEAKER_04]: They have no art people.

510
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:40,102
[SPEAKER_26]: I just think they're stupid and don't know jack about they just threw this shit together.

511
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:42,845
[SPEAKER_26]: You think if you're gonna sell something, at least make it look good.

512
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,467
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I don't know.

513
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:46,730
[SPEAKER_26]: I could do a way better job than them, that's all.

514
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:49,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab's calling this DDR Mishits.

515
00:34:50,993 --> 00:34:53,136
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I'll name it something.

516
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Total Request Live version of DDR.

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about Topic 2.

518
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,404
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, okay, what do you want to see in DDR?

519
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:02,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, people obviously have said V before.

520
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:03,809
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, well, the steps for V suck.

521
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,912
[SPEAKER_04]: You should just call it DDR that doesn't suck.

522
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR that doesn't suck.

523
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:15,481
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I was going to call it maybe like DDR Unauthorized or some shit like that, I don't know.

524
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Redband DDR, Porno DDR, no, I guess you can't have that.

525
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,424
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR XXXtreme.

526
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:22,146
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR XXXtreme.

527
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:26,028
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll even put Max the XXXium in there just for the hell of it.

528
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Put like a song called that.

529
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,072
[SPEAKER_26]: We could put crazy stuff in there.

530
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:32,473
[SPEAKER_04]: This DDR sucks.

531
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:37,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

532
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:41,366
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we just have to see, you know, how feasible this is.

533
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be the new announcer?

534
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:43,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we hack the announcer voice, too?

535
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:44,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be the announcer.

536
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:45,547
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, you can.

537
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,647
[SPEAKER_26]: We can hack the announcer voice.

538
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:51,708
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't really... I was just thinking about using just, you know, what's in there right now.

539
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:56,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, we can probably steal the stuff from, you know, Solo or whatever.

540
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Warning!

541
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,830
[SPEAKER_04]: This game causes cancer!

542
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,090
[SPEAKER_17]: We need the squirrel that goes, Whee!

543
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:03,811
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what?

544
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We may...

545
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:08,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We maybe need to get Jamie to, like, do the voices.

546
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:12,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, we haven't had a real, like, bitch in DDR since the solo nurse.

547
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:16,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamie needs to just get up there and go, You make Captain Jack cry!

548
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,268
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got no rhythm!

549
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I talk like I'm in a tin can!

550
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,451
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeehaw!

551
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,232
[SPEAKER_26]: That's in your mix, too, actually.

552
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:26,432
[SPEAKER_26]: Sadly enough.

553
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:27,493
[SPEAKER_26]: Really?

554
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:28,694
[SPEAKER_26]: Cool.

555
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, your dance makes me wet!

556
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Max!

557
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:35,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The porno mix!

558
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:38,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not want to play DDR in here myself.

559
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,600
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we need the Ridge Racer announcer.

560
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,961
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to rip lines from Ridge Racer.

561
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:42,862
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that one.

562
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:44,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You dance like a drunken crack whore.

563
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:47,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a drunken crack whore.

564
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:47,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of here!

565
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,268
[SPEAKER_04]: You step like a dog pisses.

566
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch better have my money.

567
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:54,772
[SPEAKER_15]: You step like dog piss.

568
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just... You know what?

569
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to think of it, I know DCB isn't here.

570
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see him in the chat room tonight.

571
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:03,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But we ought to just take out the announcer and just put in Wesley Willis clips.

572
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to London.

573
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Chicago.

574
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:08,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's going to get that, sorry.

575
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for killing the topic.

576
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:16,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do they get off charging $1,500 for this each?

577
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:17,191
[SPEAKER_26]: They don't.

578
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:17,831
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

579
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:20,773
[SPEAKER_26]: Unless they're selling full machines, no upgrade is worth that.

580
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:24,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't talk about some of the fabulous songs that you can play in DDR Top Hits.

581
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:26,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's name some of these gems, shall we?

582
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:42,551
[SPEAKER_26]: Featuring top US artist Britney Spears with Boyz and Krazy Boyz, I haven't heard Boyz, but you know, Krazy, maybe, but those aren't exactly, you know Let's see, Oops She Didn't Again, or what was the other one that she did?

583
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:43,192
[SPEAKER_26]: Who cares?

584
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:45,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Boyz was a song that she played in Goldmember

585
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyonce Knowles, Work It Out.

586
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:49,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that a rather new song?

587
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:49,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

588
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:53,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that song just came out a little while ago, so they've been working on this right up until right now.

589
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Out of My Head and Fia.

590
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Eminem, Without Me.

591
00:37:58,338 --> 00:37:59,018
[SPEAKER_26]: Pink, Most Girls.

592
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink, Most Girls, Ricky Martin, Cup of Life, La Vida Loca, She Bangs.

593
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:07,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, see, the people who worked on this obviously have a Ricky Martin fetish, because there's more Ricky Martin than anything else in here.

594
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,780
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, most of the songs on there I've never heard.

595
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:09,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Ricky Martin.

596
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:14,562
[SPEAKER_26]: Cup of Life sucks, Livin' La Vida Loca is crap, and She Bangs is shit.

597
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:17,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, don't you want to say that you dance to She Bangs?

598
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:22,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, Cup of Life and La Vida Loca I have heard because I have Samba de Amigo.

599
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,824
[SPEAKER_26]: Imagine the video for She Bangs.

600
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get the fucking... Wait, are you going to make new movies for the Loki mix or whatever?

601
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:37,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I was thinking of putting 2DX videos for some of them in there.

602
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:40,060
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, we could put random videos.

603
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,781
[SPEAKER_26]: We could have the ferret in there.

604
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:42,341
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

605
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,902
[SPEAKER_26]: Whatever the fuck we want to do.

606
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:45,623
[SPEAKER_26]: This is pretty much what we want to do.

607
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:50,266
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm actually surprised that they're going to go and actually do something.

608
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,666
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll just rob like Captain Jack.

609
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:56,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Go left, go right, go left, go left, go right, go left.

610
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:59,669
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just surprised that they're actually willing to do something like this.

611
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:07,351
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that's kind of ballsy, I would think, you know, just to like say, ah, you know what, we're just going to put some hack fucking arcade game in our arcade.

612
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,752
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just like, I don't know, if Jason Enos saw that.

613
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hack makes Jason Enos cry.

614
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:21,496
[SPEAKER_26]: All I gotta say, though, is if they're gonna fucking punish me, just give me a fucking job at Konami.

615
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:22,456
[SPEAKER_26]: Seriously.

616
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is this what the point is behind it, to say, either you're gonna hire me, or I'm gonna fuck you up?

617
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:35,765
[SPEAKER_26]: No, this is what it's gonna say, is, well, if you're gonna take so long to make a fucking, you know, DDR mix, and you just say, I'm gonna do it for you!

618
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:41,168
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I'm gonna say, ha, you suck, because my mix owns all of you, and you just suck ass.

619
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:41,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, look at this!

620
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:45,591
[SPEAKER_26]: My mix is more popular than the Extreme Machine in Scandia.

621
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:46,852
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, you suck!

622
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:50,734
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know how hard it would be to convert the characters over from DDRPC.

623
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:52,254
[SPEAKER_26]: We could put Mr. Spanky in training mode.

624
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:52,514
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe.

625
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:17,118
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

626
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:20,599
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll put a video in the background with him whipping Betty or something.

627
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Or no, Betty whipping him because he looks like a bitch.

628
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly with Hotton here.

629
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:31,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams, Shakira, and many more.

630
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:32,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Mariah Carey, that crap right there.

631
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be as wonderful as Glitter.

632
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:41,465
[SPEAKER_26]: It'll be as wonderful as the DDR Fifth Mix solo also.

633
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:48,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, oh yes, the DDR5 mix solo, what the hell was that all about?

634
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody ever purchase that to see if it worked or anything?

635
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,096
[SPEAKER_26]: No, but it's probably the same thing.

636
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Laser Force should die.

637
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,117
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

638
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see, they didn't hack all the songs in this though.

639
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they left in Butterfly.

640
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,021
[SPEAKER_04]: They left in Butterfly, for whatever reason, because Butterfly is poppy fun, I guess.

641
00:41:13,692 --> 00:41:16,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to take a real quick break.

642
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:24,978
[SPEAKER_04]: As promised, I'm going to play that song that I did my very first step file for because, yeah, I'm a co-host on this show and I can do things like that when I want.

643
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll hear some other stuff and we're going to come back and talk about more fun things.

644
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a new game to play tonight.

645
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:31,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do that after the break.

646
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:31,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

647
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

648
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if you guys have been good or not.

649
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:36,344
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

650
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:39,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be right back, everybody.

651
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:20,524
Thank you for watching!

652
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:02,546
[SPEAKER_05]: In the game, Drew Moore, since the day the bank was in Way back when, I've been putting it down Ask the Holy Ghost about it, get your list out of town

653
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:17,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And now here's something we hope you'll really like, Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.

654
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:20,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello everybody, this is Mr. Spanky.

655
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:27,311
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope you're enjoying getting to play me in the newest version of DDRPC.

656
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:34,397
[SPEAKER_23]: And now I'd like to present to everybody out there Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.

657
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:39,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Today we're going to talk about planning a masturbation party.

658
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:46,917
[SPEAKER_23]: Because everybody knows that Mr. Spanky likes to attend masturbation parties with his friend Betty.

659
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:56,864
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Spanky would like to remind you that when you're planning a masturbation party, do not forget the latex.

660
00:48:57,264 --> 00:49:05,870
[SPEAKER_23]: You should get several boxes of latex gloves as well as a wide variety of condoms, both lubricated and unlubricated.

661
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,933
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, pick up some dental dams.

662
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:14,477
[SPEAKER_23]: Even if people keep to themselves, the latex can add a new dimension to the fun.

663
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:21,368
[SPEAKER_23]: If the masturbation gets interactive, the latex is absolutely necessary to keep things safe.

664
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:25,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you enjoying my masturbation tips, DarkSakura?

665
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:32,087
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you enjoying my masterbass and pips, Loki?

666
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,331
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just checking, thank you.

667
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:39,213
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been a naughty boy this week.

668
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:43,676
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd also like to remind you to lube it up.

669
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:46,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Get plenty of water-based lubricants.

670
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:50,261
[SPEAKER_23]: You may want to opt for single use packets rather than big bottles.

671
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:57,847
[SPEAKER_23]: It will cost a little more but it's a lot neater and cleaner and guests will be happy to have their own lube supplies.

672
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:09,877
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd also like to remind you to cover your furniture and even the floor with seats so that will make people more comfortable and help keep things tidy.

673
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:14,420
[SPEAKER_23]: You like to keep things neat when you masturbate, don't you?

674
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:24,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Lastly, Mr. Spanky would like to urge you to clean up.

675
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:28,861
[SPEAKER_23]: Because nobody likes a messy masturbation thing.

676
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:34,265
[SPEAKER_23]: And we all know that a masturbation party can be quite a mess.

677
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:39,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Especially if you're masturbating to DVR in the nude.

678
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:41,910
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really messy.

679
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:47,634
[SPEAKER_26]: Remember folks, don't let DVR be your bitch.

680
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:55,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember to use baby wipes, tissues, and paper towels, and they should be provided in abundance.

681
00:50:57,469 --> 00:51:00,531
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to use these things to clean Mr. Spanky's bank.

682
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:09,639
[SPEAKER_23]: Things are bound to get messy, but having the necessities immediately at hand can decrease the carnage considerably.

683
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:14,539
[SPEAKER_23]: You should also set up several dress chants around the play area.

684
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:19,981
[SPEAKER_23]: Line them up with plastic bags for easy and safe disposal.

685
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:26,604
[SPEAKER_26]: Remember to take inventory on your sex toys in case something gets lodged somewhere and you lose it.

686
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:31,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Excuse me, excuse me, is your name Mr. Spanky?

687
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:33,647
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm Mr. Spanky and these are my tips.

688
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,648
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, someone's a little pissed off.

689
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:39,410
[SPEAKER_26]: Did someone get a hamster stuck up their sphincter and just kind of forget about it?

690
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:42,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Were you at that party?

691
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:44,020
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't see you at that party.

692
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:47,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, you were one of the masked people, weren't you?

693
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:48,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I understand.

694
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:53,487
[SPEAKER_23]: Is your name Valencia?

695
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:59,030
[SPEAKER_23]: That does it for Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week.

696
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:05,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Please enjoy me in the new DDR Character Pack, number 9 for DDR PC.

697
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:08,337
[SPEAKER_23]: And now, I'm taking you back to that crappy radio show.

698
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:23,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Remix

699
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:19,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?

700
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:23,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll the sound stick and move it with your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat and kill them all Damn, what am I gonna do?

701
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:24,476

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:30,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

710
00:53:30,101 --> 00:53:30,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:38,350
Damn, what am I gonna do?

718
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:38,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

721
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:58,088
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really funny.

722
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,550
[SPEAKER_04]: They should put the catch-up song in DDR.

723
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, Loki, please, please, please.

724
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:06,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, that was one of the songs planned to be in there.

725
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.

726
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

727
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a long, long, long time before we ever see anything, though, right?

728
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:18,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I plan on saying, yeah, at least six months.

729
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:20,132
[SPEAKER_26]: At least.

730
00:54:20,232 --> 00:54:20,513
[SPEAKER_26]: At least.

731
00:54:20,553 --> 00:54:20,834
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

732
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:22,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll be looking forward to that.

733
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:23,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see updates as they go.

734
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, it's funny, the catch-up song, there's another funny story I have about that.

735
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:36,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night I was out at the club and the DJ put that on as the very last song and says, I really hate this song, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

736
00:54:37,748 --> 00:54:43,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And then nobody knew the catch-up dance, so I wish Dave had been there so he could have done the catch-up dance, because he's the only person I know that knows it.

737
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I only know this.

738
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:45,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

739
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:47,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my catch up story.

740
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:48,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

741
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:01,688
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

742
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:33,148
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send me your fuck you's of the week, go ahead and do that in the chat room.

743
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Just PM them over to Sky.

744
00:55:35,768 --> 00:55:38,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, if they don't come over a private message, they don't count.

745
00:55:38,829 --> 00:55:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can send them to email.

746
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:51,272
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send them over email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And I have to ask Jamie now, do we want the terror mix of Schlagwerk or do we want the original?

747
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go for the terror mix.

748
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:53,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We want the terror mix, so I need to find it.

749
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have a new fuck you song for...

750
00:55:56,614 --> 00:55:58,435
[SPEAKER_17]: It's always going to still be Schlagwerk.

751
00:55:58,475 --> 00:55:59,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It will always be Schlagwerk.

752
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:01,457
[SPEAKER_17]: I will never not use Attack Song.

753
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:04,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you'll get Jenny Rom, JB, I promise.

754
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

755
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the Fuck Use of the Week.

756
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:14,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's... This is fucked up.

757
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:14,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

758
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:23,750
[SPEAKER_17]: The first fuck you of the week goes to Walgreens for not having chocolate cupcakes.

759
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody here knows that chocolate cupcakes are my crack food.

760
00:56:27,691 --> 00:56:28,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they didn't have them.

761
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:31,012
[SPEAKER_17]: They had chocolate zingers, which I think are becoming my new crack food.

762
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:36,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so I'm not as sufficiently wired as I could be, although I almost finished a bottle of Propel.

763
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:40,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Which fuck you to Mr. Spanky for making me nearly choke on my Propel.

764
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:40,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

765
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, let's see.

766
00:56:46,226 --> 00:56:47,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he likes choking.

767
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:49,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mr. Spanky, from what I hear, enjoys choking.

768
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:58,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Another fuck you goes toward the shitty week I had, because I just felt shitty and PMS-y, and that sucked.

769
00:56:59,393 --> 00:57:00,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, you know, that was bad.

770
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:04,856
[SPEAKER_17]: My other fuck you is a very, very serious fuck you.

771
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:07,795
[SPEAKER_17]: It goes toward drama queens.

772
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Not all drama queens are bad, mind you.

773
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:16,777
[SPEAKER_17]: But then there's the people who complain about their life and then don't do shit to change it.

774
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:19,978
[SPEAKER_17]: If you hate your life, do something about it.

775
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:24,719
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want change to happen, go make it fucking happen.

776
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:30,241
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it may not be instant, but you don't have a right to bitch unless you start doing something about it.

777
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:30,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

778
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,162
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I want to say about that.

779
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:40,752
[SPEAKER_17]: and on a happier note, um, do you need to be happy bunny plushies and fuck them for not making me?

780
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see a happy bunny doll once.

781
00:57:43,454 --> 00:57:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere.

782
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:44,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

783
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:45,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on a topic, I think.

784
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and a happy bunny plushie?

785
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll find you one for Christmas.

786
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:51,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

787
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:52,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, one more thing.

788
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny the Homicidal Maniac is cool.

789
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

790
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting many fuck yous of the week in the chat room.

791
00:57:57,962 --> 00:57:58,942
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of surprising.

792
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:00,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen one pop up so far.

793
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually there's like 20.

794
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just another reminder, send them all on your way.

795
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:07,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're sending them over email, that's fine too.

796
00:58:07,206 --> 00:58:11,308
[SPEAKER_26]: OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com They need happy noodle boy plushies.

797
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:15,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving along, Loki, your fuck yous of the week, please.

798
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:16,440
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh boy.

799
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:22,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let's begin with that hellhole that we call Sunsplash.

800
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:24,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Or Arvigil for all those.

801
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:25,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me do this time.

802
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:29,632
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well I went there two days this week, that was probably mistake number one.

803
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:33,816
[SPEAKER_26]: First thing I go there, there's some dumbass behind the counter, I want, you know, soda.

804
00:58:34,397 --> 00:58:37,740
[SPEAKER_26]: You stand there, kind of, you know, dead to the world.

805
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,162
[SPEAKER_26]: So I see the bell, and I press spell.

806
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:42,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

807
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:43,385
[SPEAKER_26]: I do that for about two minutes.

808
00:58:43,846 --> 00:58:47,229
[SPEAKER_26]: And it finally goes, oh, oh, oh, and just sees me there.

809
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,772
[SPEAKER_26]: So then I'm like, okay, can I get a large surge?

810
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:51,534
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, we don't have surge no more.

811
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:54,477
[SPEAKER_26]: So fuck them for not having surge, and fuck that stupid idiot.

812
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck them for hiring dumbass people.

813
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,102
[SPEAKER_26]: Why the hell do they have dumbass kids working at this stupid place?

814
00:58:59,822 --> 00:59:00,183
[SPEAKER_26]: I swear.

815
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:07,750
[SPEAKER_26]: and fuck them today for not fucking refilling the machine fast enough with tickets because I keep kicking ass at stupid Speed Demon.

816
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:14,917
[SPEAKER_26]: So fuck them for that and just fuck them for not keeping the machines up because they suck ass.

817
00:59:15,337 --> 00:59:16,559
[SPEAKER_26]: So I hate them, that's fine.

818
00:59:17,499 --> 00:59:24,166
[SPEAKER_26]: Now the next thing I have an FU for is SQS, also known as Stupid Question Syndrome.

819
00:59:25,026 --> 00:59:28,329
[SPEAKER_26]: These stupid people out there that ask you really dumb, obvious questions.

820
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:32,833
[SPEAKER_26]: For instance, when I'm playing the machine, I have a giant stash of tickets in there.

821
00:59:33,093 --> 00:59:35,456
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you win those from that machine there?

822
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:38,438
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

823
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:40,460
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why they're coming at the machine?

824
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,823
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why there's a big pile attached to the machine on the floor.

825
00:59:44,404 --> 00:59:45,425
[SPEAKER_26]: I won them for the machine.

826
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:46,626
[SPEAKER_26]: How did you know that?

827
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,341
[SPEAKER_26]: I won them, you fucking idiot!

828
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, for people that drive below the speed limit.

829
00:59:52,983 --> 00:59:54,964
[SPEAKER_26]: The speed limit's posted there, so you drive faster than it.

830
00:59:55,185 --> 00:59:58,447
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a goal, you know, you wanna achieve better than the speed limit.

831
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:05,753
[SPEAKER_26]: But these people are just like, oh, the speed limit, they stay away from it like it's like a fucking, uh, leper or something like that, you know?

832
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:09,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like, stay away from that piece of shit, and they drive like 20 under the speed limit.

833
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,099
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, trying to swerve around them and shit.

834
01:00:13,544 --> 01:00:14,065
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate them.

835
01:00:14,305 --> 01:00:15,246
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate slow people.

836
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:16,687
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate slow people mentally.

837
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:18,629
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate slow people in automobiles.

838
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,790
[SPEAKER_26]: May they all die.

839
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:25,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Fucking A. I swear, they should give me, you know, fucking license to kill.

840
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:27,897
[SPEAKER_26]: I would save the world.

841
01:00:28,737 --> 01:00:32,301
[SPEAKER_26]: Just eliminate the fucking weakness of our damn society.

842
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,315
[SPEAKER_26]: KILL THE STUPID PEOPLE!

843
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:35,816
[SPEAKER_26]: KILL THEM ALL!

844
01:00:36,597 --> 01:00:40,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but without stupid people, what would give us smart people any kind of meaning?

845
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,760
[SPEAKER_17]: There has to be a balance.

846
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,122
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll just lock them up in little pens.

847
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:50,186
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but right now it's like 9 to 10, or 9 to 1, or something like that, you know?

848
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,129
[SPEAKER_26]: You have 9 stupid people, and you have 1 smart person.

849
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,710
[SPEAKER_26]: 9 stupid people, 1 smart person.

850
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,991
[SPEAKER_25]: I say we just, like, drop it down to 3 to 1?

851
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:59,293
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, something like that?

852
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:02,917
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so they all suck.

853
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:03,437
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate them.

854
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Stupid people are meant to be peons of the smart.

855
01:01:05,718 --> 01:01:08,000
[SPEAKER_17]: We order them around and they fight our war for us.

856
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:12,982
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but then they're stupid and they get in our way and they annoy me and they ask me stupid questions and just... I hate them.

857
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:13,963
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate them all.

858
01:01:14,443 --> 01:01:14,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Die.

859
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:16,644
[SPEAKER_26]: Fucking die.

860
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:18,605
[SPEAKER_16]: You want all their balls to die.

861
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:19,666
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

862
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, that, yeah, that's pretty much it.

863
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,968
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, FB to Fortune Cookie to tell me to kill my relatives.

864
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:30,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Because, uh, I don't like that.

865
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:32,389
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not cool.

866
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,610
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh, yeah, Fortune Cookies kind of suck.

867
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,890
[SPEAKER_26]: What kind of fortunes are these?

868
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:40,571
[SPEAKER_26]: It says, you'll inherit a large sum of money from your relatives.

869
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,779
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching.

870
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:44,500
[SPEAKER_26]: See you next time.

871
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:08,019
[SPEAKER_26]: I forget what the fucking thing said, but it basically called me ugly or stupid, so the fuck that stupid fortune cookie?

872
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,459
[SPEAKER_26]: See, it said I'm stupid!

873
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Said I'm stupid!

874
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,280
[SPEAKER_26]: May they die!

875
01:02:13,921 --> 01:02:14,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, that's it.

876
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,202
[SPEAKER_17]: You're stupid, it said you didn't have any common sense.

877
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:21,120

[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Brad.

884
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:14,707
[SPEAKER_04]: But not too much.

885
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:15,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene's watching.

886
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:24,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to say F you to being tired because I was really tired at the club last night.

887
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:27,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just not cool to go to a club and feel like you're dancing like a zombie.

888
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're at a golf club, then, you know, that's what you're supposed to be doing.

889
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:34,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to say F you to not doing a damn thing this week, really.

890
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of sat at home and just relaxed all week.

891
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:42,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, F you to sleeping like 12 hours, because that's what I did last night.

892
01:03:42,895 --> 01:03:47,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to bed at 4.30 in the morning and I woke up at 4-ish, 4.30 this afternoon.

893
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you to sleeping 12 hours, because what a waste of time.

894
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,660
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't say F you to me, because I'm too nice for you.

895
01:03:53,661 --> 01:03:55,242
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you your song in Animal Crossing.

896
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:57,183
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, you did get my song in Animal Crossing.

897
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:01,024
[SPEAKER_26]: FU for Rob not being here when I got here and had to wait half an hour in the cold.

898
01:04:01,244 --> 01:04:09,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, FU to me sleeping in so long that it took me a while to go get Jamie and Loki had to wait out here in the cold in front of my house for a half hour.

899
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:10,726
[SPEAKER_16]: But I saw Harry Potter today.

900
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:13,927
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Loki because he brought Mongolian barbecue and steak up my whole house, asshole.

901
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:15,568
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw Harry Potter today.

902
01:04:16,088 --> 01:04:16,468
[SPEAKER_17]: My day was good.

903
01:04:16,488 --> 01:04:16,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Not an FU.

904
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:18,589
[SPEAKER_17]: No, my day was good.

905
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:19,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha ha.

906
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:20,149
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's all your bad days.

907
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:22,717
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

908
01:04:23,357 --> 01:04:26,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around the room and listen to some other Fuck You's of the Week.

909
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,182
[SPEAKER_04]: JB, do you have any Fuck You's of the Week?

910
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:29,562
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I do.

911
01:04:46,568 --> 01:04:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

912
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:48,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

913
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Hand that microphone on over to Bradley, see if he has anything he wants to say.

914
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:55,533
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, not too much, I think.

915
01:04:55,913 --> 01:04:57,714
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe they fuck me for being so lazy all the time.

916
01:04:58,055 --> 01:05:00,576
[SPEAKER_27]: I need to find a job, I just sit around at home all day doing nothing.

917
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,949
[SPEAKER_27]: City and IRC, talking to people.

918
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least you're not on unemployment.

919
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:07,131
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not on unemployment.

920
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least you're not, you're leeching from the system.

921
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not bagging on the system.

922
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,154
[SPEAKER_27]: You're okay.

923
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:16,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, and maybe adding to Loki's fuck you to the people on the road.

924
01:05:17,056 --> 01:05:20,218
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck people who gawk all the time and slow everyone down for miles.

925
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:25,581
[SPEAKER_27]: People like to see people just stop on the side of the road because they have many other problems than people else.

926
01:05:26,181 --> 01:05:26,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, look!

927
01:05:26,581 --> 01:05:27,542
[SPEAKER_19]: There's someone on the side of the road!

928
01:05:27,562 --> 01:05:28,123
[SPEAKER_19]: There's stuff!

929
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:29,824
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, look!

930
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And stare and slow down and slow everyone else down!

931
01:05:33,303 --> 01:05:41,466
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to talk to him, so I ignore him, I walk around, I don't talk to him, I don't make eye contact with him, I wish he would just die, and stop talking to me!

932
01:05:41,526 --> 01:05:43,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Stop trying to talk to me!

933
01:05:58,251 --> 01:06:01,593
[SPEAKER_02]: and FU to the kid who likes to grab... JB, chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.

934
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room's saying you gotta be a little louder.

935
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the kid that grabs asses in a football tournament.

936
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:09,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure that's not Mr. Spanky's son?

937
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,161
[SPEAKER_26]: What's he wearing, leather?

938
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:15,203
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh... Oh, ass!

939
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:21,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go on to the chat room and email FU, shall we?

940
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Good God, Twin, you got too many FUs.

941
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading some of these.

942
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:33,882
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of FUs to Justin for being Jenny Rom's bitch and not his and not sending him Jenny Rom songs.

943
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:38,225
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to people at the arcade literally hanging on the PVP machine.

944
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:39,946
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to still having dial-up.

945
01:06:40,146 --> 01:06:41,827
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Jenny Rom songs being hard to find.

946
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Mr. Spanky, finally someone with his opinions.

947
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:49,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to no one using the new V-host he set up for the chatroom.

948
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,605
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to... Oh no, that's not an F you.

949
01:06:56,787 --> 01:06:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an happy F you.

950
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't read happy things on this show, so F you, Twen.

951
01:07:02,324 --> 01:07:05,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyline says, F you to Germs for making him sick.

952
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:07,187
[SPEAKER_04]: That does suck.

953
01:07:07,247 --> 01:07:07,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate being sick.

954
01:07:07,928 --> 01:07:08,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sick a couple weeks ago.

955
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:11,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Black Lab has a few F yous.

956
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I better restart the song.

957
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:13,011
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be long.

958
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:14,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that Mr. Spanky thing.

959
01:07:14,973 --> 01:07:16,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been internally soiled.

960
01:07:16,234 --> 01:07:16,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

961
01:07:17,354 --> 01:07:18,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Spanky, thank you.

962
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:19,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

963
01:07:20,657 --> 01:07:26,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the UCD library for only having one copy of every book, so some of the books I needed weren't in stock.

964
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:31,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the drama that my suitemates are getting into with other people, and fuck the MGL... Oh, that's not very nice.

965
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:40,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, he says fuck himself because he has two finals and can't go to the MGL tournament on Friday the 13th.

966
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

967
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us have jobs in K-Road.

968
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:52,393
[SPEAKER_04]: But we realize that the people organizing the tournament probably couldn't get any other day, so life just sucks sometimes.

969
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:55,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I won't be able to go to that either, and I want to, I really do.

970
01:07:55,555 --> 01:07:56,235
[SPEAKER_16]: We send our love.

971
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:58,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we send our love and blowjobs.

972
01:07:59,457 --> 01:08:06,121
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetStudio says, F you for still having the same Vanessa May song for the longest time now.

973
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:07,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we need to work on that.

974
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:08,982
[SPEAKER_17]: We're never getting rid of Destiny.

975
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,564
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll never get rid of Destiny, but we might add something else in there too.

976
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we won't red hot in there and...

977
01:08:14,506 --> 01:08:17,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I want Devil's Chill in there, but I think that's a little too fast for me.

978
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:17,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall see.

979
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:23,214
[SPEAKER_26]: And F you to the bastard who keeps outbidding me on my Japanese PlayStation 2.

980
01:08:23,654 --> 01:08:24,495
[SPEAKER_26]: It's my bitch!

981
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:25,516
[SPEAKER_26]: Back down!

982
01:08:25,696 --> 01:08:26,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Or go down!

983
01:08:27,178 --> 01:08:30,621
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

984
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:31,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

985
01:08:31,943 --> 01:08:32,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have another one, Jamie.

986
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:33,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

987
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:35,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to my Parapara controller for not working.

988
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:36,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

989
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:41,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Vidpower says, F you to viruses.

990
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a cold all week and I started running a small fever.

991
01:08:44,022 --> 01:08:45,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have a sore throat from it.

992
01:08:45,403 --> 01:08:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, F you to the sun for having glare on the Beatmania 2DX machine and making the screen even harder to see.

993
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:55,110
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you have a Beatmania 2DX machine in town.

994
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:55,690
[SPEAKER_04]: F you.

995
01:08:58,192 --> 01:09:00,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Slinky says, F you to the Metreon pads for sticking.

996
01:09:03,795 --> 01:09:04,616
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you expect?

997
01:09:08,584 --> 01:09:09,825
[SPEAKER_26]: Why are you playing at the Metreon?

998
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:10,966
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like two bucks a game.

999
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:14,810
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck the Metreon for charging that much for a piece of shit EDR USA.

1000
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, they have Max 2s upstairs now.

1001
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:19,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1002
01:09:20,755 --> 01:09:25,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to point that out.

1003
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:27,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1004
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:30,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he went to the auto show today.

1005
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:32,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Loki says that's okay.

1006
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:38,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Brack2000 says, F you to Lost Ketchup for existing.

1007
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:39,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1008
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,311
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know, they're the ladies that sing the Ketchup song.

1009
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:44,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically stole that song from the Sugarhill Gang, by the way.

1010
01:09:46,773 --> 01:09:48,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sample of Rapper's Delight.

1011
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,822
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the closest DDR machine being 40 miles away.

1012
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap, that does suck.

1013
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:56,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1014
01:09:58,284 --> 01:09:59,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had a cry for you just now.

1015
01:09:59,725 --> 01:10:00,646
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, cry.

1016
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:05,370
[SPEAKER_27]: I drove out to Roosevelt Beltland 40 miles every week to play DDR.

1017
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,671
[SPEAKER_27]: So screw you, I don't care.

1018
01:10:06,991 --> 01:10:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you wanted to, you could go to Tapioca Express.

1019
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:11,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Not when it first came out here.

1020
01:10:11,754 --> 01:10:12,715
[SPEAKER_27]: That's right.

1021
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,836
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the USA day.

1022
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:15,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1023
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:17,259
[SPEAKER_27]: I first started playing this.

1024
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:24,730
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus says, F you to Afronova Primeval, which he passed with 1 tenth of a bar left.

1025
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, F you to Nori Nori Nori for obvious reasons.

1026
01:10:26,951 --> 01:10:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that happens to be the song I'm playing right now.

1027
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,952
[SPEAKER_17]: It was me and Wanda the first time I passed it.

1028
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:43,235
[SPEAKER_17]: I had like half my... Actually, I had... You know how on Fifth Mix they have the little tiny bars that equal the whole bar?

1029
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:45,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I had half of one of those left.

1030
01:10:45,055 --> 01:10:48,196
[SPEAKER_17]: That sucks.

1031
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:51,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, fuck Wanda.

1032
01:10:52,691 --> 01:10:53,752
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess that's it.

1033
01:10:53,792 --> 01:11:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we need to check now, because I know we have at least one email sitting in there, so I will go to the mail.

1034
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:04,056
[SPEAKER_04]: La la la, going to the mailbag.

1035
01:11:04,096 --> 01:11:05,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I need mailbag music.

1036
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:06,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's open up the mailbag.

1037
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:10,359
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have to play one Jenny Rom song just because it fits.

1038
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to play Email Me.

1039
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Email Me is not Jenny Rom, that's Paul and Terry.

1040
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:17,362
[SPEAKER_04]: You meant Blonde Girl.

1041
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,121
[SPEAKER_04]: You want Blonde Girl or you want Email Me?

1042
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:20,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Email Me.

1043
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:23,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to break your own ban?

1044
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:25,446
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not on the normal playlist.

1045
01:11:25,787 --> 01:11:26,087
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1046
01:11:26,307 --> 01:11:29,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it used to be, but I took it out because you banned Paul Eteri, remember?

1047
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:31,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead and play it because I actually kind of want to hear it.

1048
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:31,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1049
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:35,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one coming out of the closet tonight on the show, apparently.

1050
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:37,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, okay.

1051
01:11:37,518 --> 01:11:38,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Here.

1052
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:39,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me this.

1053
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:40,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1054
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:42,543
[SPEAKER_17]: I just turned it off because I can't hear.

1055
01:11:43,023 --> 01:11:43,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this is me...

1056
01:11:52,065 --> 01:11:52,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Say something!

1057
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:53,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi!

1058
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:54,466
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you looking for?

1059
01:11:54,486 --> 01:11:55,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for a new song?

1060
01:11:55,426 --> 01:11:58,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1061
01:11:58,067 --> 01:11:59,088
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our email music?

1062
01:11:59,628 --> 01:11:59,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1063
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our new email music.

1064
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:04,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1065
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:12,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And Rob is typing in stuff.

1066
01:12:13,573 --> 01:12:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, I forgot we changed the password to the box.

1067
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:16,494
I forgot about this.

1068
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:19,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same one as the LiveJournal password.

1069
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, tell everybody about the LiveJournal community.

1070
01:12:21,983 --> 01:12:24,404
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a LiveJournal community.

1071
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:27,725
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called Orange Lounge.

1072
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:36,188
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge, you get to look at our crap every day.

1073
01:12:36,948 --> 01:12:38,009
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's interesting crap.

1074
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:38,769
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't stink.

1075
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1076
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:44,774
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Yahoo for sending me spam.

1077
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We have spam in our mailbox right now.

1078
01:12:46,615 --> 01:12:51,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like I wrote a note to myself in there, too, which I already took care of, so I can delete those.

1079
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's open up this email from Dave, who isn't here tonight.

1080
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent us an email saying, I'm not there.

1081
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, read this word for word.

1082
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:00,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1083
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:07,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sorry I couldn't be there this week, so a big F you to both my parents for taking me to Big Sur, which blows ass.

1084
01:13:07,654 --> 01:13:08,435
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Big Sur?

1085
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:09,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Waterbed store.

1086
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1087
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:12,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the coast?

1088
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:13,319
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they do there?

1089
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:14,540
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

1090
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,161
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's where they have, like, surfing companies.

1091
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:17,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1092
01:13:17,943 --> 01:13:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a surf shop, dude!

1093
01:13:19,204 --> 01:13:22,707
[SPEAKER_17]: No, when I lived in Alabama, there's a waterbed store called Big Sur Waterbeds.

1094
01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:25,886
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait, Loki, in the mic.

1095
01:13:26,347 --> 01:13:28,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Big Sur is a fucking campground.

1096
01:13:28,348 --> 01:13:29,669
[SPEAKER_26]: It's in, like, the coast.

1097
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:33,413
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, it's like a forest or some shit like that.

1098
01:13:33,653 --> 01:13:35,334
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to take this show to the wilderness!

1099
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:37,676
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never heard of that place.

1100
01:13:37,776 --> 01:13:39,498
[SPEAKER_17]: I always knew of it as being a waterbed store.

1101
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:47,843
[SPEAKER_27]: I was going to drive down past there, but fuck you to the Sacramento traffic, so I had to go to some mountains.

1102
01:13:47,943 --> 01:13:48,403
[SPEAKER_27]: That was cool.

1103
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:51,746
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I got to do that before the snow came to the mountains.

1104
01:13:53,347 --> 01:13:55,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, by the way, is the king of impromptu road trips.

1105
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:56,729
[SPEAKER_04]: The king.

1106
01:13:57,569 --> 01:13:58,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, JB?

1107
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:01,652
[SPEAKER_28]: The name of that one movie where they have a place where they camp out?

1108
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,488
[SPEAKER_04]: George Lounge and the Blair Witch Project, thank you.

1109
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck was that?

1110
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:17,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck this, fuck that!

1111
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:22,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That was basically the Blair Witch Project in 10 seconds, thank you.

1112
01:14:22,397 --> 01:14:24,419
[SPEAKER_26]: The Mr. Spanky Project!

1113
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:25,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Da-da-dum!

1114
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:31,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep reading.

1115
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:51,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha.

1116
01:14:52,336 --> 01:15:01,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, if you want to join our IRC chat, just go to any other side IRC server and it's Channel Pound Orange Lounge, or it's on most of the same servers as the other big Mamani chat rooms.

1117
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: How cute.

1118
01:15:01,824 --> 01:15:07,449
[SPEAKER_26]: I was there last night, and the only person there was Black Lab, so... Oh, well, you were there for a second.

1119
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,130
[SPEAKER_04]: You were idling.

1120
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:09,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I was asleep.

1121
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:11,913
[SPEAKER_26]: I was downloading stuff.

1122
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:17,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, FYI, you can get to the chat room directly through our website.

1123
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:23,075
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Java chat for those of you that just don't have the time to set up MIRC or don't want to or you're on a work computer.

1124
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:27,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why the hell you'd be at work on a Sunday night, but it is Monday morning in some countries.

1125
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,078
[SPEAKER_16]: You know we don't have Java on my work computer?

1126
01:15:29,098 --> 01:15:30,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that kind of sucks.

1127
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:31,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't let us run the... I can't run it.

1128
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:40,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you can do that directly through our website, orangelounge.skiu.tx F you to Jamie for eating my taquitos a while ago.

1129
01:15:41,559 --> 01:15:43,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, you left him here, butthole.

1130
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's about it.

1131
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:45,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe more later.

1132
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:49,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, ladies and gentlemen, was our FUs of the week.

1133
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, I got one more.

1134
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:53,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more, I'm sorry.

1135
01:15:54,128 --> 01:15:56,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to find a special song for this FU too, I'm sorry.

1136
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me one minute here.

1137
01:16:02,374 --> 01:16:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1138
01:16:04,395 --> 01:16:04,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1139
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:07,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, we'll take a break right after this FU.

1140
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:16,076
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Internet Drama from DCB.

1141
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:17,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1142
01:16:17,858 --> 01:16:22,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can hear, but we're playing Wesley Willis for you in the background.

1143
01:16:23,483 --> 01:16:28,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, because Jamie has to pee, we're going to take a quick break and we will be right back.

1144
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we come back, the Bamani Cage Match, a brand new game we're going to play here.

1145
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show.

1146
01:16:36,294 --> 01:16:46,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Your votes will determine what the next song to go into Orange Lounge playlist rotation during the Bomani Music & More program, which plays when we're not on this station, will be.

1147
01:16:47,605 --> 01:16:52,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, so in the meantime, enjoy some Guitar Freaks music.

1148
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:53,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay.

1149
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:11,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1150
01:17:34,337 --> 01:17:36,883

[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go!

1155
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:35,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball Hello Alright, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Episode number 21

1156
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:44,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, as promised, we are going to start the Big Fat Bomani Cage Match.

1157
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I need some good cage match music.

1158
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,041
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a good... What's a good cage match song?

1159
01:27:50,942 --> 01:27:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Something 2DX-ish.

1160
01:27:52,402 --> 01:27:53,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking something kind of...

1161
01:27:56,665 --> 01:27:58,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I don't know if I have We Will Rock You.

1162
01:27:58,465 --> 01:27:58,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I might.

1163
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:02,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have one of the other Queen covers in another directory.

1164
01:28:03,786 --> 01:28:05,927
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, like, uh... Radical Fate?

1165
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:08,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, alright, that'll work.

1166
01:28:08,427 --> 01:28:08,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll work.

1167
01:28:09,468 --> 01:28:11,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Shlag works for another segment, don't you think?

1168
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, Electro-Tuned.

1169
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:14,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Electro-Tuned.

1170
01:28:15,829 --> 01:28:17,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have Electro-Tuned?

1171
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:17,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I did.

1172
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:18,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you?

1173
01:28:18,509 --> 01:28:20,290
[SPEAKER_17]: If you've got... I've got them all.

1174
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1175
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got everything, it's just in a different directory.

1176
01:28:25,671 --> 01:28:26,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think...

1177
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:30,974
[SPEAKER_15]: How about Holic?

1178
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:31,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Holic's a good song.

1179
01:28:31,795 --> 01:28:32,616
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Holic?

1180
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:33,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Holic will work.

1181
01:28:33,857 --> 01:28:36,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1182
01:28:36,619 --> 01:28:36,799
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1183
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:37,520
[SPEAKER_17]: What, JB?

1184
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:37,780
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1185
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:38,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Get out!

1186
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:39,902
[SPEAKER_17]: You are banned from the show.

1187
01:28:42,204 --> 01:28:45,426
[SPEAKER_04]: JB just admitted that he does not like tag.

1188
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:46,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he likes QQQ.

1189
01:28:46,467 --> 01:28:48,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw the Clifford ball at him.

1190
01:28:54,556 --> 01:29:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: The Clifford Ball of Justice has been tossed to JB Without further ado The Bomani Cage Match

1191
01:29:01,713 --> 01:29:09,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, since the first time we've done the Bomani Cage match, what this is going to be all about is we're going to play you two songs, and they aren't from any Bomani game.

1192
01:29:09,837 --> 01:29:11,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play that out in front.

1193
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:28,726
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not from any Bomani game, but they have something to do with either a Bomani artist, a Bomani, some kind of Bomani relation, like another cover of a Bomani song, another Dance Maniacs dance track, or it's just kind of video game related.

1194
01:29:29,246 --> 01:29:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the winner wins

1195
01:29:58,246 --> 01:30:04,191
[SPEAKER_26]: The winner is then challenged next week by a new song, and if a new song beats the winner out, then it plays for the week.

1196
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:06,693
[SPEAKER_26]: Otherwise, the winner will stay on and play for the next week.

1197
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:14,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe what we'll do is we'll do next week it'll be three and we'll bring back the one from last week as well.

1198
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:15,473
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that.

1199
01:30:15,653 --> 01:30:16,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

1200
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this week it's only going to be two folks.

1201
01:30:20,294 --> 01:30:22,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only going to be two songs that we're going to play.

1202
01:30:22,055 --> 01:30:24,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, are we going to actually play the entire songs or do you just want to play clips?

1203
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:25,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we ought to play the whole song.

1204
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:28,816
[SPEAKER_17]: No, play clips of each and then whichever one wins plays the whole thing.

1205
01:30:29,956 --> 01:30:30,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we ought to play the whole song.

1206
01:30:30,996 --> 01:30:32,057
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how... What?

1207
01:30:34,117 --> 01:30:34,297
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1208
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:37,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Really different all the way through.

1209
01:30:37,282 --> 01:30:38,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what do you guys think?

1210
01:30:38,242 --> 01:30:38,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1211
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:39,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Full song?

1212
01:30:47,938 --> 01:30:49,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, we'll do the whole thing.

1213
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're going to do, though, is we're not going to go into that right just yet.

1214
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:59,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to another topic on the program and kind of do that as our next break.

1215
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do it now?

1216
01:31:01,146 --> 01:31:01,846
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll do it now.

1217
01:31:02,267 --> 01:31:06,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the two songs we're going to match up tonight in the Big Mamadi Cage match.

1218
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Oop, not Viv Ribbon, my bad.

1219
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:10,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'll be next week, though.

1220
01:31:12,273 --> 01:31:14,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the two songs are...

1221
01:31:15,919 --> 01:31:18,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The Zippers with All Around the World, The Bubble Mix.

1222
01:31:18,901 --> 01:31:21,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those that don't know who the Zippers are, well, JB, you're the expert.

1223
01:31:21,283 --> 01:31:24,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell everybody who the Zippers are and what they've done in DDR?

1224
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:30,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zippers were Jenny Rom versus Zippers, and they did Waka Waka.

1225
01:31:30,931 --> 01:31:36,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't really tell the difference between them because they both sound exactly the same.

1226
01:31:36,255 --> 01:31:36,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1227
01:31:39,545 --> 01:31:46,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, and the second song that we're going to have playing is going to be, it's actually an overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy, or FF Music DJ.

1228
01:31:47,493 --> 01:31:51,777
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Final Fantasy 7, String Machine, the Choral Prison mix.

1229
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:57,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Choral, or Chorel, whatever.

1230
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:27,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So first we're going to play, and then you'll also get to get our opinions Since we have to participate in this somehow, we're not getting to vote in this You're going to get our big fat opinions on this We're going to be like the American Idol judges on these songs So if they suck, we're going to let you know So we're putting on our judging faces right now So, and then once we've given you our opinions on the songs, you'll be able to vote Now here's the thing, don't vote until they've both been played or your vote doesn't count I'm not counting any votes that come in until the second song has finished completely

1231
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they're saying they can't hear you on the air, JB.

1232
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,921
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to scream something at the camera?

1233
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:34,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

1234
01:32:35,602 --> 01:32:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant.

1235
01:32:36,443 --> 01:32:37,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here we go.

1236
01:32:37,603 --> 01:32:41,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off the Bomani Cage match, this is the Zippers with All Around the World.

1237
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:41,705
1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3

1238
01:33:12,698 --> 01:33:25,003
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanna get some fun all around the world Let's sing some in this magical land You know Hey boy, come on This is a silly song for you Oh yeah We're gonna get some fun all around the world We wanna be

1239
01:36:17,435 --> 01:36:19,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I sing this song, song, song for you

1240
01:37:03,328 --> 01:37:04,809
[SPEAKER_15]: This song makes me want to kill people.

1241
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:08,772
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the Bomani Cage Match in progress right now.

1242
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:11,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That was All Around the World by The Zippers.

1243
01:37:12,154 --> 01:37:17,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Your thoughts, some things from the chatroom.

1244
01:37:17,618 --> 01:37:28,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting, this song is the shit, this song reminds me of CatDog, and I can't tell because there's a whole other cage match going on in the chatroom, so I can't really tell what they're saying about the song.

1245
01:37:28,086 --> 01:37:29,767
[SPEAKER_17]: That song may be the shit, but it's time to flush.

1246
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:31,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie, ouch.

1247
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:32,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So you didn't like it.

1248
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:34,091
[SPEAKER_04]: On a scale of 1 to 10, Jamie.

1249
01:37:35,092 --> 01:37:36,013
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd give it a fart.

1250
01:37:38,536 --> 01:37:46,584
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd have to say that, you know, I really hated the song Around the World by ATC, but I like that song now.

1251
01:37:46,604 --> 01:37:48,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So you like that song or you like this song?

1252
01:37:48,205 --> 01:37:53,410
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just not digging the whole Disneyland happy vibe going on here.

1253
01:37:57,029 --> 01:37:57,829
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, JB.

1254
01:37:57,849 --> 01:37:59,490
[SPEAKER_26]: I like it because it's Sci-Fam.

1255
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:01,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it because it's Sci-Fam.

1256
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:02,471
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

1257
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:03,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, your thoughts on that song?

1258
01:38:04,631 --> 01:38:09,452
[SPEAKER_27]: It was okay, but it kept going on and on, the same beat over and over.

1259
01:38:09,472 --> 01:38:13,093
[SPEAKER_27]: I was like, uh-oh, turn it off, turn it off.

1260
01:38:14,074 --> 01:38:16,394
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to pound into my brain until it explodes.

1261
01:38:16,774 --> 01:38:18,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Four hours a day.

1262
01:38:20,575 --> 01:38:22,176
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you were about to go postal?

1263
01:38:22,216 --> 01:38:22,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1264
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:27,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, my thoughts are it was very happy, happy, happy, happy.

1265
01:38:27,714 --> 01:38:29,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of like nauseatingly happy.

1266
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:32,778
[SPEAKER_04]: The beginning was bad, but I could deal with it.

1267
01:38:33,058 --> 01:38:34,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that bad.

1268
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:38,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice change of pace from, you know, meanness.

1269
01:38:39,082 --> 01:38:40,003
[SPEAKER_17]: In what dictionary?

1270
01:38:40,723 --> 01:38:42,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you going to notthedictionary.com?

1271
01:38:44,106 --> 01:38:45,967
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's what makes me want to go out and kill people.

1272
01:38:46,868 --> 01:38:47,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And sing while I'm doing it.

1273
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:49,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so...

1274
01:38:50,307 --> 01:38:51,648
[SPEAKER_17]: It makes me happy, noodle boy happy.

1275
01:38:51,728 --> 01:38:53,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, going around the room, quick, scale of 1 to 10.

1276
01:38:54,289 --> 01:38:57,971
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1277
01:38:58,031 --> 01:38:58,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, 1.5.

1278
01:38:58,491 --> 01:38:58,151
1.5.

1279
01:38:58,651 --> 01:38:59,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley?

1280
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:00,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably about a 4.

1281
01:39:00,552 --> 01:39:01,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably about a 4.

1282
01:39:01,132 --> 01:39:01,472
[SPEAKER_03]: JB?

1283
01:39:02,373 --> 01:39:01,472
10.

1284
01:39:02,393 --> 01:39:04,734
[SPEAKER_04]: 10.

1285
01:39:03,453 --> 01:39:04,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I will give it a 6.

1286
01:39:05,434 --> 01:39:05,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a 6.

1287
01:39:06,354 --> 01:39:08,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so that was... I'm twitching.

1288
01:39:08,695 --> 01:39:09,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Zippers all around the world.

1289
01:39:09,836 --> 01:39:11,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the second song in the cage match.

1290
01:39:11,457 --> 01:39:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: This is by Final Fantasy Music DJ.

1291
01:39:13,778 --> 01:39:14,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an overclocked remix.

1292
01:39:14,858 --> 01:39:18,420
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Final Fantasy 7 String Machine here on the Bomani Cage Match.

1293
01:39:22,336 --> 01:39:22,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1294
01:40:03,627 --> 01:40:04,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1295
01:41:32,481 --> 01:41:34,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1296
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:38,915
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fucking cool!

1297
01:44:07,501 --> 01:44:09,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Bomani Cage match going on right now.

1298
01:44:09,444 --> 01:44:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: You can start sending in your votes right now via the chat room or our email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1299
01:44:16,573 --> 01:44:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is, once again, the Zippers with All Around the World was the first song we played, and that song was Final Fantasy Music DJ, an overclocked remix of Final Fantasy VII String Machine.

1300
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's talk about what we thought of the Final Fantasy String Machine.

1301
01:44:30,551 --> 01:44:31,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, your thoughts?

1302
01:44:31,292 --> 01:44:31,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Wee!

1303
01:44:31,812 --> 01:44:32,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1304
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:33,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee, you love it.

1305
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1306
01:44:34,574 --> 01:44:35,234
[SPEAKER_26]: I, of course, love it.

1307
01:44:35,314 --> 01:44:38,416
[SPEAKER_26]: It's one of the best Final Fantasy music remixes I've ever heard.

1308
01:44:39,437 --> 01:44:40,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Which song was it?

1309
01:44:40,237 --> 01:44:41,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't recognize what song it was.

1310
01:44:41,598 --> 01:44:46,101
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I guess it's supposed, it's, yeah, Choral Prison from Final Fantasy VII.

1311
01:44:46,261 --> 01:44:48,563
[SPEAKER_26]: I honestly didn't recognize the original song either.

1312
01:44:48,623 --> 01:44:49,303
[SPEAKER_26]: To me, that's obscure.

1313
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:51,565
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the place that was in the desert under the Gold Cross Ark.

1314
01:44:52,285 --> 01:44:53,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1315
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play Final Fantasy VII again sometime.

1316
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:56,631
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that song makes me think.

1317
01:44:56,892 --> 01:44:57,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, your thoughts on the song?

1318
01:44:58,273 --> 01:44:58,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

1319
01:44:59,034 --> 01:44:59,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool?

1320
01:44:59,735 --> 01:45:00,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

1321
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:01,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you liked it.

1322
01:45:01,057 --> 01:45:01,758
[SPEAKER_04]: JB, your thoughts?

1323
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,582
[SPEAKER_04]: X. He's making a big X with his fingers.

1324
01:45:05,183 --> 01:45:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, he's a Jenny Rom horse, so of course he's sticking with the zippers.

1325
01:45:08,547 --> 01:45:09,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not happy enough for him.

1326
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

1327
01:45:26,713 --> 01:45:28,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's very cool.

1328
01:45:28,954 --> 01:45:31,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, it's a little bit kind of repetitive for my taste.

1329
01:45:31,695 --> 01:45:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1330
01:45:32,196 --> 01:45:33,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I found it to be a little bit repetitive.

1331
01:45:33,636 --> 01:45:35,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's my only issue with it.

1332
01:45:35,557 --> 01:45:36,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So, scale of 1 to 10.

1333
01:45:37,258 --> 01:45:38,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, what do you think?

1334
01:45:38,959 --> 01:45:38,939
9.

1335
01:45:39,759 --> 01:45:40,559
[SPEAKER_04]: 9.

1336
01:45:40,259 --> 01:45:40,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1337
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:40,559
10.

1338
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,400
[SPEAKER_04]: 10.

1339
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:42,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley?

1340
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:42,400
8.

1341
01:45:43,661 --> 01:45:44,061
[SPEAKER_04]: JB?

1342
01:45:45,362 --> 01:45:44,061
4.

1343
01:45:46,402 --> 01:45:46,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give it a 7.

1344
01:45:48,323 --> 01:45:54,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it sounds like that song would win if we were the people voting, but we're not, because this is everybody's show.

1345
01:45:54,528 --> 01:45:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just our show, it's the chatroom show, email show.

1346
01:45:57,110 --> 01:46:07,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So send in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email address, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com If you want the zippers to win, or you want the Final Fantasy VII string machine to win.

1347
01:46:08,179 --> 01:46:09,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, that's my arcade match.

1348
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:11,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the results for you after the next break.

1349
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:13,603
[SPEAKER_16]: This is your subliminal message, but for Final Fantasy.

1350
01:46:13,683 --> 01:46:17,266
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime... The spirit commands it.

1351
01:46:18,277 --> 01:46:19,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Big news this week, Big Bomani Holiday.

1352
01:46:44,508 --> 01:46:48,770
[SPEAKER_04]: 19 November and 20 November were both this week, and we had some very big things happen.

1353
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:51,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, tell us about one thing you wanted to talk about.

1354
01:46:51,231 --> 01:46:53,212
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel 20 November and its honor on 2DX.

1355
01:46:53,592 --> 01:46:54,032
[SPEAKER_04]: On 2DX?

1356
01:46:54,192 --> 01:46:54,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1357
01:46:54,812 --> 01:47:02,616
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to just, I guess, consider, or just basically say 19 and 20 November would pretty much be the Bomani New Year's.

1358
01:47:03,316 --> 01:47:10,699
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much what it is, since 20 November was pretty much the start of the whole Bomani line with Beatmania, so I would consider it the New Year's.

1359
01:47:11,462 --> 01:47:15,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I consider it New Year's, it's not a big party, it's just kind of like a day of remembrance.

1360
01:47:16,427 --> 01:47:19,310
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, okay, hey, hey, hey.

1361
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:22,333
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just like Chinese New Year's, I mean, no one celebrates that.

1362
01:47:23,374 --> 01:47:24,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Chinese do, I think.

1363
01:47:24,915 --> 01:47:26,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, like they count, okay.

1364
01:47:26,897 --> 01:47:29,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're only like, you know, I think a quarter of the world's population.

1365
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1366
01:47:31,482 --> 01:47:33,684
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much what it is, it's an uncelebrated holiday.

1367
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:34,345
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, um...

1368
01:47:35,786 --> 01:47:36,286
[SPEAKER_26]: Arbor Day.

1369
01:47:37,107 --> 01:47:38,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's the Bomani Arbor Day.

1370
01:47:40,688 --> 01:47:41,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant a Bomani machine.

1371
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So what were some big events that happened in the community?

1372
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:47,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you know of one.

1373
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:49,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you want to talk about this earlier?

1374
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:52,353
[SPEAKER_17]: I got online and they were like, the show wasn't there.

1375
01:47:52,413 --> 01:47:53,273
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like robbed.

1376
01:47:53,951 --> 01:47:58,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Orange Lounge Radio did a celebration very late on 19 November around 11.30.

1377
01:47:58,533 --> 01:48:00,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of had a countdown until 20 November.

1378
01:48:01,034 --> 01:48:02,674
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had video game guessing.

1379
01:48:02,894 --> 01:48:08,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and then 20 November was celebrated guessing old school 8-bit video game tunes.

1380
01:48:08,436 --> 01:48:11,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why you should be listening to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.

1381
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:13,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, have your life like us.

1382
01:48:13,178 --> 01:48:16,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes you get to hear special live music programs.

1383
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:17,440
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen occasionally.

1384
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We call them the fuck-offs.

1385
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:23,008
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1386
01:48:45,623 --> 01:48:48,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't use the Nokia ringtones and that makes me cry.

1387
01:48:48,064 --> 01:48:50,564
[SPEAKER_17]: But we wanted to play your ringtone, didn't we?

1388
01:49:15,371 --> 01:49:19,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my ringtone's not Baymani, but... Well, let's play your ringtone anyway, because we wanted to do this.

1389
01:49:20,014 --> 01:49:21,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to call you right now, Jamie.

1390
01:49:21,575 --> 01:49:22,515
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can just play it.

1391
01:49:22,535 --> 01:49:23,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can just play it?

1392
01:49:23,376 --> 01:49:24,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

1393
01:49:24,296 --> 01:49:25,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't give me any voicemail, damn it.

1394
01:49:28,539 --> 01:49:30,200
[SPEAKER_17]: My ringtone is cooler than everybody.

1395
01:49:40,406 --> 01:49:42,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if anybody in the chat room is going to recognize it.

1396
01:49:45,233 --> 01:49:45,773
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll play it again.

1397
01:49:49,717 --> 01:49:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you won't play it again, apparently.

1398
01:49:51,438 --> 01:49:52,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I will, too.

1399
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:09,732
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPower says it's Chun-Li's stage.

1400
01:50:10,253 --> 01:50:10,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong!

1401
01:50:12,374 --> 01:50:14,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 23rd Magus says that, too.

1402
01:50:15,137 --> 01:50:15,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, no.

1403
01:50:16,177 --> 01:50:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Chun-Li.

1404
01:50:16,858 --> 01:50:17,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop insulting my girl.

1405
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:21,319
[SPEAKER_04]: For those in the chat room that couldn't guess it, what do you think?

1406
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:21,979
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it, Jamie?

1407
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:23,860
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Sakura's theme song.

1408
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura's theme song.

1409
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong girl.

1410
01:50:25,581 --> 01:50:26,481
[SPEAKER_17]: No, DarkSakura.

1411
01:50:26,701 --> 01:50:27,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Sakura's theme.

1412
01:50:28,722 --> 01:50:29,762
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate Chun-Li.

1413
01:50:30,662 --> 01:50:30,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1414
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:32,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate Chun-Li.

1415
01:50:32,283 --> 01:50:33,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So close, yet so far.

1416
01:50:33,783 --> 01:50:34,544
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost have it.

1417
01:50:34,564 --> 01:50:35,244
[SPEAKER_17]: God, I hate her.

1418
01:50:36,444 --> 01:50:37,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's my ringtone.

1419
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:38,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Bomani-related at all.

1420
01:50:41,516 --> 01:50:42,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Why isn't it playing?

1421
01:50:43,277 --> 01:50:44,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you suck.

1422
01:50:44,258 --> 01:50:45,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because it vibrates on.

1423
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:46,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, my bad.

1424
01:50:46,259 --> 01:50:47,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Rob's pocket vibrator.

1425
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my cell phone doubles... Every call is a happy call.

1426
01:50:51,842 --> 01:50:53,423
[SPEAKER_04]: My cell phone doubles as a vibrator.

1427
01:50:53,483 --> 01:50:54,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite exciting.

1428
01:50:57,365 --> 01:50:58,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that doesn't work.

1429
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:01,467
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

1430
01:51:01,487 --> 01:51:02,848
[SPEAKER_17]: There's my magical ringtones here.

1431
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:10,312
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we can't guess what that is.

1432
01:51:12,847 --> 01:51:13,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Afronova, right?

1433
01:51:14,868 --> 01:51:16,528
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a song called The Entertainer.

1434
01:51:16,828 --> 01:51:26,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure since there's this trend in Bomani to redo a bunch of classical songs into Bomani tunes, I'm sure you'll see that tune up turn up in a Bomani song one day.

1435
01:51:26,931 --> 01:51:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play that song again and you just go... Whoa!

1436
01:51:30,732 --> 01:51:31,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude!

1437
01:51:31,373 --> 01:51:32,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a talker remix!

1438
01:51:32,793 --> 01:51:35,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you should put that in your sim.

1439
01:51:36,134 --> 01:51:39,055
[SPEAKER_17]: They need to do the bad synthy music and make it a pata pata.

1440
01:51:40,771 --> 01:51:41,512
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be wrong.

1441
01:51:41,652 --> 01:51:42,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop playing with a ferret.

1442
01:51:42,693 --> 01:51:43,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me that.

1443
01:51:43,974 --> 01:51:44,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1444
01:51:45,075 --> 01:51:49,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, other 19, 20 November celebrations.

1445
01:51:49,659 --> 01:51:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan, I believe they released the code to unlock 8th Style's hidden stuff.

1446
01:51:55,363 --> 01:51:58,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you don't have to... We were thinking... I can play Sakura and fail with Style.

1447
01:51:58,446 --> 01:52:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, now you can play Sakura without having to triple A, you know, B for U on another heavy whatever.

1448
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:05,332
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Xenon.

1449
01:52:05,372 --> 01:52:07,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And two more, yep, two brand new songs also.

1450
01:52:08,274 --> 01:52:08,795
[SPEAKER_04]: But no...

1451
01:52:10,723 --> 01:52:11,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No more tag.

1452
01:52:11,864 --> 01:52:12,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie.

1453
01:52:13,004 --> 01:52:14,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to wait for Night Style.

1454
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:15,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You think there's going to be a Night Style?

1455
01:52:16,547 --> 01:52:17,387
[SPEAKER_04]: God, yes.

1456
01:52:17,427 --> 01:52:17,827
[SPEAKER_04]: God, yes.

1457
01:52:18,948 --> 01:52:19,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a ferret.

1458
01:52:20,489 --> 01:52:29,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this happened exactly on 19-20 November, but another website news, 2DX Style kind of got eaten up by BomaniStyle.com, right?

1459
01:52:29,695 --> 01:52:31,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that earlier, or what happened with that?

1460
01:52:31,115 --> 01:52:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That was last week.

1461
01:52:32,196 --> 01:52:33,037
[SPEAKER_04]: That was last week.

1462
01:52:33,097 --> 01:52:33,457
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1463
01:52:34,097 --> 01:52:35,778
[SPEAKER_26]: But didn't they kind of celebrate it?

1464
01:52:35,858 --> 01:52:39,960
[SPEAKER_26]: Bomani Style redid their site, so that's another one.

1465
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's 20 November-ish, I don't know.

1466
01:52:42,841 --> 01:52:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 19 November.

1467
01:52:43,662 --> 01:52:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other websites that redid special things for 19-20 November?

1468
01:52:46,983 --> 01:52:48,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of any.

1469
01:52:48,044 --> 01:52:49,365
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Spot was probably the biggest one.

1470
01:52:49,905 --> 01:52:56,428
[SPEAKER_26]: DDR Maniacs deleted my account along with 2,000 other ones, so I guess that's November related, sort of.

1471
01:52:57,969 --> 01:52:58,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 20 November!

1472
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:01,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 20 November.

1473
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:02,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Crunch, you're gone.

1474
01:53:02,912 --> 01:53:05,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to bed, and then I went to work.

1475
01:53:05,193 --> 01:53:09,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, how did you privately celebrate 20 November amongst ourselves in the room?

1476
01:53:09,294 --> 01:53:11,395
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your own way of celebrating 20 November?

1477
01:53:11,615 --> 01:53:15,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, first of all, I went to bed, and then I woke up and went to work.

1478
01:53:17,177 --> 01:53:22,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And instead of doing my work, I talked on my email with my friend in Maryland.

1479
01:53:23,299 --> 01:53:31,525
[SPEAKER_17]: Then I went home and I failed 20 November in 6th style on 7 key because it's a 7 star and I can't pass any yet, although I'm close.

1480
01:53:32,646 --> 01:53:39,490
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I put it away and went online and posted it on a bunch of message boards and then played Animal Crossing.

1481
01:53:41,151 --> 01:53:42,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I played 20 November again.

1482
01:53:44,493 --> 01:53:44,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1483
01:53:46,215 --> 01:53:48,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And I full comboed some songs, but I forgot what they were.

1484
01:53:48,896 --> 01:53:49,757
[SPEAKER_17]: And I passed Fantasy.

1485
01:53:49,777 --> 01:53:49,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Fantasy.

1486
01:53:51,175 --> 01:54:02,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I passed Fantasy and Light 7 on 4th style Because that was like one of the last two songs I had to do But I fucking hate Get On Beat, thank you Next Loki, how did you celebrate 20 November?

1487
01:54:02,664 --> 01:54:14,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I did one more thing I went to bed I played DDR at lunch That's it Alright, yes, Bradley, how did you celebrate 20 November?

1488
01:54:15,853 --> 01:54:16,734
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't really do much of anything

1489
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:19,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless for me!

1490
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:21,651
[SPEAKER_03]: J.B., how did you celebrate 20 November?

1491
01:54:23,073 --> 01:54:25,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I secretly worshipped Ginny Rom.

1492
01:54:26,398 --> 01:54:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, how's that different from any other day?

1493
01:54:28,339 --> 01:54:29,979
[SPEAKER_17]: That means he had a faptastic time.

1494
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:32,520
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a faptastic 20 November, yes.

1495
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jamie.

1496
01:54:34,941 --> 01:54:36,241
[SPEAKER_04]: How did I celebrate 20 November?

1497
01:54:36,722 --> 01:54:44,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to work, I came home, I watched 24, I continued my three-week streak of not playing any DDR, jerked off and went to bed.

1498
01:54:45,864 --> 01:54:46,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1499
01:54:46,805 --> 01:54:47,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1500
01:54:47,825 --> 01:54:48,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least you'll never know.

1501
01:54:49,205 --> 01:54:49,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Loki?

1502
01:54:50,526 --> 01:54:54,127
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I know this is really the wrong segment to be doing this.

1503
01:54:54,147 --> 01:54:54,967
[SPEAKER_26]: That's alright.

1504
01:54:55,427 --> 01:54:58,048
[SPEAKER_26]: But I just remembered another FU for the week.

1505
01:54:58,726 --> 01:55:01,171
[SPEAKER_26]: And it goes, wait, you don't need to play the music.

1506
01:55:01,292 --> 01:55:02,634
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't need to play the music.

1507
01:55:03,276 --> 01:55:04,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, fine.

1508
01:55:04,578 --> 01:55:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie demands I play the music.

1509
01:55:06,282 --> 01:55:07,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, I play the music.

1510
01:55:09,481 --> 01:55:15,705
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to the Sakmamani server for fucking crashing constantly all this week.

1511
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:16,445
[SPEAKER_26]: That's it.

1512
01:55:16,745 --> 01:55:20,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, also... Yeah, but you can pay for any place to host us.

1513
01:55:21,108 --> 01:55:29,793
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Sakmamani.com as well for not having the space on it to host the Orange Lounge forums as well because that kind of caused the crash.

1514
01:55:30,113 --> 01:55:35,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of trying to set up a little surprise for 20 November for Orange Lounge and that kind of pushed us over quota.

1515
01:55:35,376 --> 01:55:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1516
01:55:36,537 --> 01:55:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1517
01:55:37,317 --> 01:55:48,984
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you were Rob for the... My account got deleted yet again from another glitch that happened to be... If you're the one that posts that causes the quota to get hit, then you get your account deleted.

1518
01:55:49,545 --> 01:55:50,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Lucky me!

1519
01:55:50,465 --> 01:55:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm always online posting.

1520
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:53,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1521
01:55:53,867 --> 01:55:55,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a bigger post count out of it, I think, anyway.

1522
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:57,609
[SPEAKER_04]: As if that stuff... Oh, no, you didn't?

1523
01:55:57,650 --> 01:55:57,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1524
01:55:57,970 --> 01:55:58,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I guessed.

1525
01:55:58,970 --> 01:55:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it matters.

1526
01:55:59,591 --> 01:56:00,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still number one!

1527
01:56:01,892 --> 01:56:02,532
[SPEAKER_17]: It don't matter!

1528
01:56:03,853 --> 01:56:04,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit!

1529
01:56:04,514 --> 01:56:06,515
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm 500 posts above anyone else.

1530
01:56:07,196 --> 01:56:10,037
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get you to your ho and back, lickety-split.

1531
01:56:10,097 --> 01:56:12,578
[SPEAKER_14]: No shit.

1532
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:15,760
[SPEAKER_26]: I've got to play that again.

1533
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,481
[SPEAKER_26]: I love it.

1534
01:56:19,541 --> 01:56:20,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a different portion cookie today.

1535
01:56:21,202 --> 01:56:23,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.

1536
01:56:23,223 --> 01:56:25,804
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to announce the winner of the Bomani Cage Match.

1537
01:56:25,824 --> 01:56:27,044
[SPEAKER_04]: There is still time to vote.

1538
01:56:28,165 --> 01:56:35,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Just come to our chat room and vote via private message for the zippers with All Around the World or the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.

1539
01:56:35,848 --> 01:56:38,849
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can send it over email, orangelaunceradio at yahoo.com.

1540
01:56:39,089 --> 01:56:46,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a conversation in the chat room going on right now saying, I worked on a Brilliant to You routine over the weekend to do other people's routines for practice to see how they pull off the moves.

1541
01:56:47,152 --> 01:56:48,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps with the flow.

1542
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:51,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of made me think, there's a song I want to play right now.

1543
01:56:51,533 --> 01:56:52,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have the Ori no Go flow?

1544
01:56:53,534 --> 01:56:55,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Sail away, sail away.

1545
01:56:56,394 --> 01:56:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I thought of another flow song that I wanted to play for you guys.

1546
01:56:59,675 --> 01:57:01,416
[SPEAKER_17]: It facilitates bowel movements, though.

1547
01:57:02,276 --> 01:57:05,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start this break off with Flotation, the radio mix.

1548
01:57:05,417 --> 01:57:06,138
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a different one.

1549
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:08,839
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one from Vincent D'Amour's greatest hits album.

1550
01:57:08,859 --> 01:57:10,940
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't the same one that's in rotation on Orange Lounge.

1551
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:12,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop molesting the ferret!

1552
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two vocal mixes of Flotation.

1553
01:57:14,401 --> 01:57:16,262
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the other one that you don't normally hear on Orange Lounge.

1554
01:57:16,763 --> 01:57:18,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're going to hear it right now, so enjoy.

1555
01:57:18,163 --> 01:57:20,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Flotation

1556
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,693
Reavers in the mind

1557
01:59:14,424 --> 01:59:15,445
Thank you for watching!

1558
02:00:20,684 --> 02:00:21,269
Thanks for watching!

1559
02:04:02,001 --> 02:04:02,868
Thanks for watching!

1560
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:50,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge been lighting music in more shows?

1561
02:04:50,695 --> 02:04:57,860
[SPEAKER_27]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1562
02:04:58,180 --> 02:04:58,300
[SPEAKER_27]: It's...

1563
02:04:59,694 --> 02:05:04,119
[SPEAKER_27]: On Earthly, it's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1564
02:05:04,659 --> 02:05:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 21, and now it's time to reveal the winner of the Big Bomani Cage Match.

1565
02:05:15,009 --> 02:05:20,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight in the cage match we had The Zippers with All Around the World.

1566
02:05:20,715 --> 02:05:23,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me play a little clip of that for you to remind you what this sounds like.

1567
02:05:30,051 --> 02:05:31,472
[SPEAKER_04]: How is the Zippers with All Around the World?

1568
02:05:31,512 --> 02:05:34,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other song we played was the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.

1569
02:05:41,575 --> 02:05:54,600
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, those are the two songs that were in the cage match tonight, and I am pleased to announce the winner is, by a pretty close vote, not too far apart, the winner is the Final Fantasy VII String Machine, ladies and gentlemen.

1570
02:05:57,521 --> 02:05:57,861
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1571
02:05:57,881 --> 02:05:58,461
[SPEAKER_17]: People have tape.

1572
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:06,761
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Final Fantasy VII String Machine will be added into the Orange Lounge playlist this week.

1573
02:06:07,161 --> 02:06:13,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So check for that during the Bomani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we aren't here.

1574
02:06:14,022 --> 02:06:14,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, JB.

1575
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:15,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Zipper's lost.

1576
02:06:16,083 --> 02:06:18,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kill everybody who voted for it.

1577
02:06:19,903 --> 02:06:21,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you all the names after the show.

1578
02:06:21,764 --> 02:06:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and if you want a copy of that Final Fantasy VII remix, it's an Overclocked remix, so you can find it on Overclocked.org.

1579
02:06:29,662 --> 02:06:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want the zippers, you can contact me.

1580
02:06:32,204 --> 02:06:33,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want the zippers, just contact JB.

1581
02:06:34,025 --> 02:06:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Or anything else.

1582
02:06:35,987 --> 02:06:36,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything?

1583
02:06:36,728 --> 02:06:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Favors?

1584
02:06:38,389 --> 02:06:39,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Like favors?

1585
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1586
02:06:40,691 --> 02:06:43,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mr. Spanky has some things he needs done.

1587
02:06:43,913 --> 02:06:44,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite a lot.

1588
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:46,961
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1589
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:49,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Does Mr. Spanky need to be spanked?

1590
02:06:49,603 --> 02:06:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Some quick things.

1591
02:06:50,564 --> 02:06:57,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things that have been coming through the chat room and some various little stories as the two hours have already passed that we've been on the air.

1592
02:06:57,609 --> 02:07:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to catch up, give everybody a fair chance to have their say on the show.

1593
02:07:01,433 --> 02:07:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an email come in, a late FU come in over email, so I thought I'd read that for you guys.

1594
02:07:05,596 --> 02:07:08,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, we had a late one come in in the chat room from somebody who missed the first part of the show.

1595
02:07:08,679 --> 02:07:09,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to read those for you.

1596
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:10,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So over email...

1597
02:07:11,981 --> 02:07:14,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an email from... Oh crap, I lost the email.

1598
02:07:15,444 --> 02:07:16,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get back to the email in a little bit.

1599
02:07:17,426 --> 02:07:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read the one from the chatroom.

1600
02:07:20,308 --> 02:07:33,038
[SPEAKER_04]: DSCS SoCalKick says, F you to soccer for milking another $81 from his pocket and much more along with the next two Saturdays and my F you... Oh, and F you to his birthday for being next Monday.

1601
02:07:33,559 --> 02:07:35,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad thing to have a birthday coming up.

1602
02:07:35,420 --> 02:07:36,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a good thing.

1603
02:07:37,731 --> 02:07:38,952
[SPEAKER_17]: You're alive to celebrate it.

1604
02:07:39,733 --> 02:07:40,193
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1605
02:07:40,213 --> 02:07:41,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be glad you're alive to celebrate it.

1606
02:07:42,095 --> 02:07:42,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

1607
02:07:44,717 --> 02:07:45,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, JB.

1608
02:07:45,337 --> 02:07:47,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the microphone.

1609
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:52,043
[SPEAKER_28]: My birthday on June 15th, my mom sent me to Hollywood Ball Time for half an hour.

1610
02:07:53,063 --> 02:07:54,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she said she'd get me a metal pad.

1611
02:07:57,107 --> 02:07:59,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, F you to JB's mom for not following through on her promise.

1612
02:08:00,429 --> 02:08:00,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1613
02:08:01,931 --> 02:08:03,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We got an F you over email.

1614
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:06,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Moohimer of New Jersey.

1615
02:08:06,747 --> 02:08:07,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Moo!

1616
02:08:07,748 --> 02:08:08,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Moo.

1617
02:08:08,748 --> 02:08:12,491
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, a fuck you goes out to his mom, or, I'm sorry, not to his mom, I'm sorry.

1618
02:08:14,053 --> 02:08:16,875
[SPEAKER_04]: A fuck you goes out to his room for being small.

1619
02:08:17,075 --> 02:08:21,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens when I have the mouse over the R-O, I just assume it's another word that ends in O-M.

1620
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:21,639
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1621
02:08:21,939 --> 02:08:22,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1622
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big fuck you going out to his room for being small.

1623
02:08:26,183 --> 02:08:26,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what...

1624
02:08:26,923 --> 02:08:28,184
[SPEAKER_26]: Nothing wrong with small rooms.

1625
02:08:28,304 --> 02:08:28,945
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a small room.

1626
02:08:29,085 --> 02:08:30,626
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all about stacking.

1627
02:08:31,226 --> 02:08:33,788
[SPEAKER_26]: Stacking will save you so much space.

1628
02:08:33,848 --> 02:08:42,795
[SPEAKER_26]: I've got like 400 DVDs, a whole bunch of movies, a computer, seven game systems, a queen-size bed, and I still have room to move.

1629
02:08:42,995 --> 02:08:47,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And this studio that we do this very show in is very small, as JB learned for the first time today.

1630
02:08:47,738 --> 02:08:51,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that how you go to Walmart and you get those stacky crates and put your stuff in them?

1631
02:08:52,081 --> 02:08:58,465
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you go to Kmart, because remember, Kmart is my favorite store, I shot there cause I is poor.

1632
02:08:58,706 --> 02:09:00,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay Kmart!

1633
02:09:01,207 --> 02:09:04,549
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a cheer that they used to do in high school on the bus going to a band.

1634
02:09:06,912 --> 02:09:08,093
[SPEAKER_27]: Pretty soon they'll be with Lint.

1635
02:09:37,409 --> 02:09:38,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have another FU.

1636
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:39,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Mooheimer had two FUs.

1637
02:09:40,191 --> 02:09:41,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Please allow me to finish.

1638
02:09:41,793 --> 02:09:44,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, fuck Swishy Pants, because they're annoying.

1639
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Swishy Pants!

1640
02:09:48,742 --> 02:09:49,703
[SPEAKER_04]: They sound like fun pants.

1641
02:09:50,383 --> 02:09:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so Seinfeld right there.

1642
02:09:53,646 --> 02:09:54,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Swishy Pants!

1643
02:09:54,647 --> 02:09:55,448
[SPEAKER_26]: What's up with that?

1644
02:09:55,868 --> 02:10:03,615
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I remember it was with George, okay, and he had the pants that would rub next to each other, rub together because his legs were so fat.

1645
02:10:03,816 --> 02:10:09,421
[SPEAKER_26]: So he'd go, as he was walking, and it was like one of these annoying things that they'd rant on.

1646
02:10:09,461 --> 02:10:09,841
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

1647
02:10:09,861 --> 02:10:10,522
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't watch it.

1648
02:10:10,922 --> 02:10:12,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, what about DDR and SwishyPants?

1649
02:10:13,425 --> 02:10:20,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be... Max 300 and SwishyPants, that would be funny.

1650
02:10:21,232 --> 02:10:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: God, we're getting more FUs a little late.

1651
02:10:23,054 --> 02:10:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it.

1652
02:10:23,674 --> 02:10:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: No more FUs.

1653
02:10:24,255 --> 02:10:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the last ones, alright?

1654
02:10:26,617 --> 02:10:28,499
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Raver's Groove or whatever.

1655
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:34,524
[SPEAKER_04]: DT was one of the poor unfortunate souls that got to hear Raver's Groove play on Orange Lounge about six times in an hour.

1656
02:10:35,285 --> 02:10:35,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me play.

1657
02:10:37,734 --> 02:10:39,815
[SPEAKER_17]: That song happens to be one of my favorites, okay?

1658
02:10:39,895 --> 02:10:41,415
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not my fault that that happened.

1659
02:10:41,475 --> 02:10:43,076
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the song's fault, so get over it.

1660
02:10:45,756 --> 02:10:46,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Claus Show.

1661
02:10:48,197 --> 02:10:48,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1662
02:10:51,498 --> 02:10:52,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd pick that song, dammit.

1663
02:10:53,179 --> 02:10:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1664
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:57,040
[SPEAKER_04]: F you at late F yous.

1665
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck the late F yous.

1666
02:11:00,701 --> 02:11:04,242
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to kids on the pad while I'm playing and I'm like, bitch, get off.

1667
02:11:06,403 --> 02:11:06,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch!

1668
02:11:10,214 --> 02:11:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus says, this is Nephew, he has a little story he'd like to tell, please.

1669
02:11:14,833 --> 02:11:17,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a story of a lovely FU.

1670
02:11:18,314 --> 02:11:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an FU, it's a different one.

1671
02:11:19,654 --> 02:11:21,395
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, this is how we celebrated 20 November.

1672
02:11:21,455 --> 02:11:21,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is late.

1673
02:11:21,815 --> 02:11:22,515
[SPEAKER_04]: We need music, we need music.

1674
02:11:22,575 --> 02:11:24,316
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a late 20 November story, I'm sorry.

1675
02:11:24,916 --> 02:11:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't have 20, I have a teen November, that'll just have to work.

1676
02:11:29,697 --> 02:11:32,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have 20 November queued up and I don't feel like pulling up.

1677
02:11:33,018 --> 02:11:35,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, late 1920 November celebration story.

1678
02:11:35,619 --> 02:11:39,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the roof of the school and yelled out, Be money at the top of my lungs.

1679
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:41,060
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, I did.

1680
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:41,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1681
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took the deer in the headlights looks.

1682
02:11:44,541 --> 02:11:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Loser!

1683
02:11:44,942 --> 02:11:46,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Hey now, be nice.

1684
02:11:47,104 --> 02:11:47,845
[SPEAKER_25]: That was cool.

1685
02:11:48,586 --> 02:11:49,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's cool.

1686
02:11:49,447 --> 02:11:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the deer in the headlights parts.

1687
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that will get you deer in the headlights looks are awesome.

1688
02:11:54,952 --> 02:11:55,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Fabulous.

1689
02:11:55,893 --> 02:11:56,374
[SPEAKER_26]: Fabulous.

1690
02:11:56,654 --> 02:11:59,077
[SPEAKER_26]: Did he mention he was doing it dressed up like Mr. Spanky?

1691
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:03,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to see him dressed as Mr. Spanky, I'm sorry.

1692
02:12:04,282 --> 02:12:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1693
02:12:07,406 --> 02:12:09,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the late FUs and things of the week.

1694
02:12:09,447 --> 02:12:11,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1695
02:12:11,308 --> 02:12:14,950
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always send your FUs in a little early if you're not going to be here for the live show.

1696
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:17,631
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always send those over email, orangebronsradio at yahoo.com.

1697
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:18,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Dave did tonight.

1698
02:12:18,611 --> 02:12:19,172
[SPEAKER_04]: He got his in.

1699
02:12:19,512 --> 02:12:21,293
[SPEAKER_26]: I have an important announcement to make.

1700
02:12:22,173 --> 02:12:22,393
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1701
02:12:23,414 --> 02:12:27,796
[SPEAKER_26]: I got the hooker to have sex with me in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

1702
02:12:27,876 --> 02:12:28,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

1703
02:12:30,837 --> 02:12:32,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, isn't that special?

1704
02:12:35,925 --> 02:12:38,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Hookers are the work of the devil.

1705
02:12:42,827 --> 02:12:43,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1706
02:12:44,167 --> 02:12:45,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Satan's little play pal.

1707
02:12:45,967 --> 02:12:49,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see.

1708
02:12:49,788 --> 02:12:52,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping the other people left, that we're in the house right now.

1709
02:12:52,789 --> 02:12:53,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they really?

1710
02:12:53,889 --> 02:12:54,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

1711
02:12:56,710 --> 02:13:02,991
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate's girlfriend's parents are here right now, and Loki's just yelled out, I finally got the hooker to have sex with me!

1712
02:13:05,103 --> 02:13:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't got tact, even if you looked it up in the dictionary.

1713
02:13:16,744 --> 02:13:17,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get kicked out of my house.

1714
02:13:18,105 --> 02:13:19,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's move on.

1715
02:13:21,427 --> 02:13:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm getting 20 November stories.

1716
02:13:23,549 --> 02:13:25,190
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, we need something to fill up the show with.

1717
02:13:27,211 --> 02:13:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks... No more Denny Ross!

1718
02:13:28,952 --> 02:13:36,357
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks... SoCalKicks says... On 20 November, his friend broke his arm.

1719
02:13:37,618 --> 02:13:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

1720
02:13:37,978 --> 02:13:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

1721
02:13:39,539 --> 02:13:40,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm having a cry.

1722
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:42,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Your arm got broken and that's sad.

1723
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:45,971
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus sends us a bit of randomness here.

1724
02:13:46,011 --> 02:13:50,892
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, My English essay was titled, I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.

1725
02:13:52,433 --> 02:13:53,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Hot, hot, hot.

1726
02:13:56,614 --> 02:13:58,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That has nothing to do with 20 November, silly.

1727
02:13:59,675 --> 02:14:02,356
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks wants to point out he broke his arm in soccer.

1728
02:14:02,476 --> 02:14:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like jerking off or anything.

1729
02:14:03,817 --> 02:14:06,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Although that would have been a lot more humorous, don't you think?

1730
02:14:07,018 --> 02:14:07,858
[SPEAKER_15]: That would have been cool.

1731
02:14:09,018 --> 02:14:11,079
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have been seriously...

1732
02:14:12,259 --> 02:14:14,060
[SPEAKER_15]: either really clumsy.

1733
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:22,882
[SPEAKER_26]: That was so eight days a week, breaking your neck, trying to perform self-fallatio.

1734
02:14:22,902 --> 02:14:25,583
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like clerks.

1735
02:14:25,763 --> 02:14:27,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this one last one.

1736
02:14:27,123 --> 02:14:28,304
[SPEAKER_04]: No more 20 November stories.

1737
02:14:28,344 --> 02:14:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't care.

1738
02:14:28,804 --> 02:14:30,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1739
02:14:30,424 --> 02:14:34,806
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB says he played Beatmania's second mix and got 100% greats on Overdoser.

1740
02:14:35,486 --> 02:14:36,646
[SPEAKER_04]: You're special.

1741
02:14:38,087 --> 02:14:39,427
[SPEAKER_04]: You are very, very special.

1742
02:14:41,258 --> 02:14:41,558
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1743
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:43,299
[SPEAKER_04]: No more 20... What?

1744
02:14:44,099 --> 02:14:44,299
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1745
02:14:44,539 --> 02:14:45,920
[SPEAKER_26]: This is actually Pomani-related.

1746
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:47,281
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, dear God, what?

1747
02:14:47,661 --> 02:14:53,343
[SPEAKER_26]: And because of 20 November happened to be falling on a Wednesday, there was a new Naoki Journal.

1748
02:14:54,003 --> 02:14:54,383
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1749
02:14:54,544 --> 02:14:55,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Boo!

1750
02:14:55,944 --> 02:15:00,166
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, well, they announced the new Naoki Underground song, which, I mean... Now, that's cool.

1751
02:15:00,206 --> 02:15:00,406
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1752
02:15:00,686 --> 02:15:01,327
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

1753
02:15:15,349 --> 02:15:15,689
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so excited!

1754
02:15:15,909 --> 02:15:16,269
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so excited!

1755
02:15:16,289 --> 02:15:17,329
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so scared!

1756
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:43,781
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1757
02:15:57,986 --> 02:15:58,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Caffeine pills?

1758
02:15:59,587 --> 02:15:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1759
02:16:26,909 --> 02:16:27,970
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, got it wrong again.

1760
02:16:29,011 --> 02:16:30,052
[SPEAKER_24]: I love my job.

1761
02:16:32,395 --> 02:16:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1762
02:16:33,436 --> 02:16:34,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to... Oh, yes.

1763
02:16:34,677 --> 02:16:36,158
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling that.

1764
02:16:36,298 --> 02:16:36,899
[SPEAKER_17]: We gotta do it again.

1765
02:16:38,401 --> 02:16:40,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, where's the emotion?

1766
02:16:40,362 --> 02:16:40,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Do it again.

1767
02:16:41,724 --> 02:16:43,946
[SPEAKER_26]: This time we'll take the still photos.

1768
02:16:44,006 --> 02:16:44,166
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1769
02:16:45,267 --> 02:16:45,528
[SPEAKER_25]: Once more.

1770
02:16:45,548 --> 02:16:46,008
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1771
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,809
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

1772
02:16:48,413 --> 02:16:54,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the news, because this is something that really, it doesn't have anything to do with Bomani, but it's kind of funny anyway.

1773
02:16:55,239 --> 02:17:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of people that play Bomani eat a lot of fast food, and a lot of people also kind of play Bomani as a way to diet.

1774
02:17:01,564 --> 02:17:05,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people play, I admit, when I started playing DDR, I thought it was cool because I was suddenly losing weight.

1775
02:17:05,927 --> 02:17:09,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, now that I haven't played DDR in about a month, I'm gaining it all back, but that's beside the point.

1776
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:12,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought I'd read this funny little article and get your guys' thoughts on it.

1777
02:17:13,673 --> 02:17:17,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Lawyers claim that Big Mac... Oh, I guess I need some music for this.

1778
02:17:17,719 --> 02:17:19,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some news music.

1779
02:17:19,581 --> 02:17:20,322
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, DJ Ranma.

1780
02:17:24,983 --> 02:17:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: God, do I even have that in here?

1781
02:17:27,445 --> 02:17:31,209
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that in the playlist?

1782
02:17:31,269 --> 02:17:35,653
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to just play Journey to Wonderland.

1783
02:17:35,673 --> 02:17:36,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Toasty burgers!

1784
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:37,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Where is it?

1785
02:17:37,615 --> 02:17:39,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Toasty buns, there it is.

1786
02:17:39,357 --> 02:17:39,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1787
02:17:39,677 --> 02:17:40,939
[SPEAKER_15]: This kind of goes with it anyway.

1788
02:17:48,243 --> 02:17:52,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, lawyers claim that Big Macs make kids fat.

1789
02:17:56,607 --> 02:17:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Are Big Macs hazardous to children's health?

1790
02:17:59,228 --> 02:18:07,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's on behalf of New York children who have suffered health problems including diabetes and high blood pressure and obesity.

1791
02:18:07,651 --> 02:18:14,234
[SPEAKER_04]: In a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, a lawyer alleged that the fast food chain has created a national epidemic of obese children.

1792
02:18:15,689 --> 02:18:24,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Samuel Hirsch agreed that the high fat, sugar, and cholesterol content of McDonald's food is a very insipid, toxic kind of thing when ingested regularly by young kids.

1793
02:18:25,473 --> 02:18:31,496
[SPEAKER_04]: The plaintiffs include a Bronx teen who ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while living in a homeless shelter.

1794
02:18:32,636 --> 02:18:41,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is a 13-year-old boy from Staten Island who says he ate McDonald's food three to four times a week and is now 5'4 and 278 pounds.

1795
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:50,163
[SPEAKER_04]: McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman insisted that the lawsuit was a frivolous attempt to cash in on the Golden Arches, the kind of lawsuit that shouldn't be in court.

1796
02:18:50,743 --> 02:18:53,184
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't go to sleep and then wake up obese, Lerman said.

1797
02:18:53,524 --> 02:19:00,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and french fries do to us have been with us for a long, long time.

1798
02:19:00,545 --> 02:19:14,489
[SPEAKER_04]: McDonald's has asked Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the case, arguing those who filed the claims cannot show their health woes were caused by Big Macs, and insisting the company has never misled customers about his food.

1799
02:19:15,896 --> 02:19:21,638
[SPEAKER_04]: The judge did not immediately rule on the request.

1800
02:19:21,778 --> 02:19:24,919
[SPEAKER_26]: All I gotta say is, fucking exercise, lazy bastard.

1801
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:31,702
[SPEAKER_26]: Shit, man, I eat fast food every day of the week, you know, and I'm not like some big tub of lard that's like walking around shit.

1802
02:19:31,942 --> 02:19:33,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Get up and do something.

1803
02:19:34,162 --> 02:19:37,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't just sit there and go, Me eat more burger!

1804
02:19:37,764 --> 02:19:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Good!

1805
02:19:38,544 --> 02:19:40,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You sounded like me for you just then.

1806
02:19:44,386 --> 02:19:44,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

1807
02:19:47,748 --> 02:19:48,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

1808
02:19:49,330 --> 02:19:50,010
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1809
02:19:54,193 --> 02:19:57,736
[SPEAKER_04]: JB's chastising Loki for... Anyway.

1810
02:19:58,176 --> 02:19:58,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1811
02:19:58,696 --> 02:20:00,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So what'd you think about the Big Mac story?

1812
02:20:01,498 --> 02:20:05,661
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, McDonald's is disgusting and I haven't eaten there in easily four years.

1813
02:20:06,422 --> 02:20:09,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Except that they had those really tasty bagel sandwiches.

1814
02:20:10,452 --> 02:20:26,594
[SPEAKER_20]: DCB and Orange Beanie are in the chat room suggesting that the following should go along with this It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat It is a good place to listen to the music People flock here to get down to the rock music

1815
02:20:29,426 --> 02:20:33,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, rock and roll McDonald's, ladies and gentlemen.

1816
02:20:41,514 --> 02:20:46,118
[SPEAKER_04]: See, if everybody would just rock and roll a little bit while they're at McDonald's eating Big Macs, maybe they wouldn't get so fat.

1817
02:20:46,558 --> 02:20:51,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, they put the nutritional information there easily readable.

1818
02:20:52,283 --> 02:20:57,027
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, well, I don't know, maybe most of the people who eat there are illiterate, I don't know.

1819
02:20:57,308 --> 02:21:01,071
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, those people eating those Big Macs are the same people who think that smoking doesn't hurt anyway.

1820
02:21:01,171 --> 02:21:06,295
[SPEAKER_26]: The things that, I don't know, that the government's, you know, not corrupt and...

1821
02:21:08,518 --> 02:21:12,024
[SPEAKER_26]: They have no tune with the obvious at all.

1822
02:21:12,104 --> 02:21:12,906
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, huh?

1823
02:21:13,226 --> 02:21:14,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are unhealthy for me?

1824
02:21:14,889 --> 02:21:16,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't you think someone would tell me that?

1825
02:21:17,541 --> 02:21:20,362
[SPEAKER_17]: This goes back to people being really stupid, okay?

1826
02:21:20,882 --> 02:21:30,645
[SPEAKER_17]: People are going to watch TV, and they're going to see this on there, and they'll think, oh, well, that looks dumb, even though they're basically looking at big piles of glycerin that are colored, you know, so they don't melt into light or something.

1827
02:21:31,486 --> 02:21:41,509
[SPEAKER_17]: They're looking at this, and they're thinking, oh, well, that looks tasty, and it's so ingrained into society that the general masses, who are, unfortunately, really stupid, are going to fall for it.

1828
02:21:42,512 --> 02:21:44,033
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I think is very funny?

1829
02:21:44,113 --> 02:21:48,836
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if this goes hand in hand, but since I stopped watching TV so much, I've eaten out so often.

1830
02:21:49,116 --> 02:21:50,757
[SPEAKER_17]: At least at major chains.

1831
02:21:51,677 --> 02:21:54,459
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this one lady that works at McDonald's that has no teeth.

1832
02:21:57,586 --> 02:22:00,927
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole thing is that it's a matter of choice in using your brain.

1833
02:22:01,468 --> 02:22:04,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, people just don't know how to use their brain.

1834
02:22:04,489 --> 02:22:06,710
[SPEAKER_17]: They want to be sheep like everybody else.

1835
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:10,091
[SPEAKER_26]: There was this one chick at the McDonald's that we used to go to, actually.

1836
02:22:10,231 --> 02:22:12,552
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just some Chinese chick with an eye patch.

1837
02:22:12,672 --> 02:22:15,193
[SPEAKER_26]: We used to go, Arrgh!

1838
02:22:15,893 --> 02:22:18,334
[SPEAKER_26]: Every time we'd get our stuff from her, it was quite funny.

1839
02:22:18,374 --> 02:22:19,155
[SPEAKER_26]: That's kind of mean.

1840
02:22:20,895 --> 02:22:23,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Arrgh, matey!

1841
02:22:23,176 --> 02:22:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Hand over me Big Mac!

1842
02:22:26,894 --> 02:22:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I have to say about McDonald's.

1843
02:22:29,156 --> 02:22:37,865
[SPEAKER_04]: One time I went to McDonald's, this one right by my work, and I ordered two hamburgers without cheese and without onions because I cannot fucking stand McDonald's onions.

1844
02:22:37,885 --> 02:22:39,486
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the nastiest fucking shit on this earth.

1845
02:22:39,746 --> 02:22:40,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Dehydrated onions?

1846
02:22:40,747 --> 02:22:41,888
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is up with that?

1847
02:22:41,969 --> 02:22:42,529
[SPEAKER_27]: They're awesome.

1848
02:22:42,549 --> 02:22:42,969
[SPEAKER_27]: They're awesome.

1849
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:43,330
[SPEAKER_27]: I love them.

1850
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:44,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Gross.

1851
02:22:45,271 --> 02:22:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1852
02:22:46,391 --> 02:22:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, F you to Bradley for liking McDonald's onions.

1853
02:22:50,013 --> 02:22:53,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, I order my burger without cheese and without onions, right?

1854
02:22:54,055 --> 02:22:56,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it back to work, I open it up, and what do I find?

1855
02:22:57,036 --> 02:22:59,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, gosh, this hamburger seems awfully thin.

1856
02:22:59,857 --> 02:23:01,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I bite into it, no meat.

1857
02:23:03,839 --> 02:23:06,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I bit into two pieces of bread covered in ketchup and mustard and pickles.

1858
02:23:08,294 --> 02:23:09,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck McDonald's.

1859
02:23:09,235 --> 02:23:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: God.

1860
02:23:09,956 --> 02:23:10,756
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is what happened.

1861
02:23:11,217 --> 02:23:13,238
[SPEAKER_04]: My co-worker called them.

1862
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I'm kind of a pussy, I let people walk all over me like that.

1863
02:23:16,802 --> 02:23:20,845
[SPEAKER_04]: My co-worker heard me show, I was running, of course, only the way I can do.

1864
02:23:20,905 --> 02:23:23,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I started, you know, what's the first thing I'm going to do when I get a bad burger?

1865
02:23:23,227 --> 02:23:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I run around and show all my co-workers, oh, look how McDonald's fucked me over.

1866
02:23:26,210 --> 02:23:27,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, let's eat a burger.

1867
02:23:27,131 --> 02:23:28,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I open it up where I took a bite.

1868
02:23:29,333 --> 02:23:31,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And my co-worker's like, you're not going to put up with that crap, are you?

1869
02:23:31,595 --> 02:23:33,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So he calls and he got me two free meals at McDonald's.

1870
02:23:35,038 --> 02:23:38,560
[SPEAKER_04]: This was about six weeks ago and I still haven't used my free meals at McDonald's.

1871
02:23:39,221 --> 02:23:40,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, here, more poison for you.

1872
02:23:41,703 --> 02:23:48,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want a free meal at McDonald's, just go over to McDonald's on Madison and Hazel and tell them that... Never mind, I'm not going to tell you who sent you.

1873
02:23:49,149 --> 02:23:49,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not under my name.

1874
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:51,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Madison and Hazel.

1875
02:23:52,872 --> 02:23:53,232
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

1876
02:23:54,173 --> 02:23:55,014
[SPEAKER_26]: They're dumbasses.

1877
02:23:55,054 --> 02:23:56,455
[SPEAKER_26]: That was the same place I went there.

1878
02:23:56,795 --> 02:24:03,460
[SPEAKER_26]: We're getting our meal and the guy's talking through the PA system out where the drive-thru stuff is.

1879
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:03,721
[SPEAKER_26]: He's like...

1880
02:24:04,461 --> 02:24:22,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, I know you can hear me, Kenny, meanwhile we're sitting in the window going, food, give us our food, Kenny, give me a six dollar burger, Kenny, Kenny,

1881
02:24:22,856 --> 02:24:23,576
[SPEAKER_26]: Kenny!

1882
02:24:24,276 --> 02:24:24,897
[SPEAKER_26]: Kenny!

1883
02:24:25,237 --> 02:24:27,977
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, fucker, just give me the goddamn food!

1884
02:24:28,057 --> 02:24:30,578
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like sitting on the back counter.

1885
02:24:30,778 --> 02:24:32,158
[SPEAKER_26]: I could see it with my own eyes.

1886
02:24:32,178 --> 02:24:35,299
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, can't reach food!

1887
02:24:35,319 --> 02:24:37,600
[SPEAKER_26]: He's like, Kenny!

1888
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:39,820
[SPEAKER_26]: The guy was a fucking dumbass.

1889
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:40,980
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all I have to say.

1890
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, they killed Kenny.

1891
02:24:44,761 --> 02:24:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, Orange Beanie is saying, meat is bad.

1892
02:24:47,142 --> 02:24:48,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be a vegetarian and don't eat at McDonald's at all.

1893
02:24:48,902 --> 02:24:49,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Meat is bad.

1894
02:24:50,683 --> 02:24:52,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Except I eat chicken still, but...

1895
02:24:53,351 --> 02:24:58,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to date a vegan and it was really interesting going to McDonald's because they couldn't even eat the fries, really.

1896
02:24:58,653 --> 02:25:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Oh, you gotta go?

1897
02:25:00,573 --> 02:25:01,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that your pager?

1898
02:25:01,134 --> 02:25:01,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, JB.

1899
02:25:01,474 --> 02:25:02,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Say bye to everybody.

1900
02:25:02,294 --> 02:25:03,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Any closing thoughts from JB?

1901
02:25:03,594 --> 02:25:04,034
[SPEAKER_28]: Ginny rum?

1902
02:25:04,395 --> 02:25:04,815
[SPEAKER_28]: Ginny rum.

1903
02:25:05,095 --> 02:25:05,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, JB.

1904
02:25:06,495 --> 02:25:08,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Need pork, daddy!

1905
02:25:10,407 --> 02:25:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get drunk and sue Budweiser Hey fat people, what's this one say?

1906
02:25:25,521 --> 02:25:25,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob.

1907
02:25:49,833 --> 02:25:54,797
[SPEAKER_26]: There's another headline I saw on Yahoo, because you know Yahoo has always the best headlines.

1908
02:25:55,157 --> 02:26:01,002
[SPEAKER_26]: It was some stupid kid, they threw a flaming chair at this kid in the back of a pickup truck.

1909
02:26:02,503 --> 02:26:05,325
[SPEAKER_26]: And this kid was part of it, and they were filming him.

1910
02:26:06,326 --> 02:26:11,150
[SPEAKER_26]: It was one of those jackass... And he got hurt, and they said, oh, it must have been from a jackass stunt.

1911
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:17,272
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, what, so every dumb thing that stupid kids do and catch on camera is a jackass stunt?

1912
02:26:17,532 --> 02:26:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1913
02:26:18,733 --> 02:26:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1914
02:26:20,013 --> 02:26:20,653
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think so.

1915
02:26:21,013 --> 02:26:22,974
[SPEAKER_26]: It's funny, doesn't he have a part where he can rate the top?

1916
02:26:22,994 --> 02:26:23,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki don't play that.

1917
02:26:24,295 --> 02:26:25,235
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't play that shit.

1918
02:26:27,205 --> 02:26:27,885
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I think?

1919
02:26:28,686 --> 02:26:52,894
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that all those, back to the topic at hand, the fast food crap, I think that those places, actually, they need to be, if they were subsidized for having a healthy menu and high quality food, which they could still make just as fast as the cheap crap that, you know, is so bad for you, if they were offered a government subsidy for providing good food to people,

1920
02:26:54,563 --> 02:27:05,046
[SPEAKER_17]: That would actually, I think, improve a lot of the health of their consumers and possibly get them repeat business, but the other thing is our government doesn't give a shit about it anyway.

1921
02:27:05,387 --> 02:27:07,427
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, they've kind of improved their stuff.

1922
02:27:07,447 --> 02:27:14,049
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they changed their fry recipe around to make it, like, a lot less oil and there's less fat grams and stuff in there, so they're doing stuff.

1923
02:27:14,109 --> 02:27:15,370
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, why...

1924
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:16,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

1925
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:18,691
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, we go there, we know what's in the food.

1926
02:27:19,011 --> 02:27:22,352
[SPEAKER_26]: We know that it's not meat between those patties, or between the bread.

1927
02:27:22,372 --> 02:27:27,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Even so, as a manufacturer, you do have a responsibility to your consumer.

1928
02:27:27,514 --> 02:27:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What about if they just put a DDR machine in every McDonald's?

1929
02:27:31,536 --> 02:27:32,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Two Big Macs and Shitty Rom!

1930
02:27:32,877 --> 02:27:33,597
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1931
02:27:34,917 --> 02:27:36,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that game for fags.

1932
02:27:37,543 --> 02:27:40,164
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I'm going to eat my burger.

1933
02:27:41,625 --> 02:27:43,226
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, heart attack.

1934
02:27:43,326 --> 02:27:45,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Ugh, die.

1935
02:27:45,607 --> 02:27:52,990
[SPEAKER_17]: It just has to do with people caring enough about themselves and being smart enough to know what's good for them.

1936
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:54,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Love yourself.

1937
02:27:54,651 --> 02:27:55,472
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

1938
02:28:11,912 --> 02:28:14,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, there's this bagel cafe place near where I work.

1939
02:28:14,813 --> 02:28:19,735
[SPEAKER_17]: I can go there and get a turkey sandwich with avocado and no mayonnaise and everything, and that's nice and healthy.

1940
02:28:20,115 --> 02:28:24,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Or I could go get, you know, freshly made teriyaki at another place just as fast.

1941
02:28:25,317 --> 02:28:39,483
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's certainly more satisfying than going and getting a piece of bread that's been in a bag for five years and this piece of something that's supposed to resemble meat that, you know, probably still has the green ink stamp from when they stamped the damn thing in the first place.

1942
02:28:40,283 --> 02:28:54,174
[SPEAKER_17]: and, you know, you can look at this, you can pay, you know, five dollars and get this unsatisfying, you know, piece of shit burger and, you know, this soda which you're actually paying about ten times what the value of the soda is.

1943
02:28:54,194 --> 02:28:58,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Or you can go buy a bottle of juice and get yourself a nice sandwich and...

1944
02:28:59,117 --> 02:29:01,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Overall, your body is going to thank you for it.

1945
02:29:01,798 --> 02:29:09,020
[SPEAKER_17]: People who complain they don't have any energy, they're not going to have that complaint anymore because they're actually going to be fueling themselves.

1946
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:10,181
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the difference right there.

1947
02:29:10,781 --> 02:29:16,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, there have been studies linked that prove that eating a consistent diet of fast food also does contribute to stupidity.

1948
02:29:18,483 --> 02:29:24,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Your brain doesn't function as properly when you're eating nothing but shit.

1949
02:29:24,605 --> 02:29:25,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, I heard just the opposite.

1950
02:29:26,166 --> 02:29:37,355
[SPEAKER_26]: They just did a study on the news saying that snack foods give actually higher test results during a short period of time.

1951
02:29:37,815 --> 02:29:39,136
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not fast food, though.

1952
02:29:39,576 --> 02:29:43,339
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, if you eat any carbohydrate, it's going to increase your brain function.

1953
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Bombay has another great suggestion in the chat room.

1954
02:29:46,762 --> 02:29:48,703
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you cook instead of eating at a fast food place?

1955
02:29:48,883 --> 02:29:49,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly!

1956
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:54,122
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just talking about for people like when you're at work and you haven't brought your lunch or something.

1957
02:29:54,142 --> 02:29:55,143
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, there's alternatives.

1958
02:29:55,163 --> 02:29:57,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Because I'm lazy and McDonald's takes two minutes to get, okay?

1959
02:29:58,124 --> 02:29:59,405
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what it comes down to.

1960
02:29:59,445 --> 02:30:00,926
[SPEAKER_26]: And I love their goddamn fries.

1961
02:30:01,586 --> 02:30:02,927
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't stand the stupid people.

1962
02:30:02,947 --> 02:30:04,268
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't stand to go inside there.

1963
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:07,389
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't stand to smell the ugly, nasty people that are in there.

1964
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:08,690
[SPEAKER_26]: The smell is horrible.

1965
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:11,352
[SPEAKER_17]: This also goes back to those people who are on those low-carb diets.

1966
02:30:12,172 --> 02:30:17,377
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't realize that when they're eating no carbohydrates, they're actually killing themselves.

1967
02:30:18,257 --> 02:30:22,501
[SPEAKER_17]: The state of ketosis, basically, is the state that your body goes into when it's about to die.

1968
02:30:23,262 --> 02:30:24,603
[SPEAKER_17]: When it starts feeding on itself.

1969
02:30:25,944 --> 02:30:34,331
[SPEAKER_26]: Those are the same... Okay, the same people that are making this argument right here are the same people who go and supersize their extra value meal and they get Diet Coke.

1970
02:30:36,515 --> 02:30:37,216
[SPEAKER_17]: That saves them.

1971
02:30:37,256 --> 02:30:38,697
[SPEAKER_17]: You know how many calories that saves them?

1972
02:30:38,937 --> 02:30:40,178
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making Diet Vanilla Coke now.

1973
02:30:40,198 --> 02:30:40,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?

1974
02:30:41,039 --> 02:30:43,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I've seen it.

1975
02:30:44,542 --> 02:30:46,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Say that you're going to Burger King and you're getting a Whopper.

1976
02:30:46,563 --> 02:30:49,345
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, a Whopper has a calorie count of 750 calories.

1977
02:30:49,846 --> 02:30:50,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Your typical Whopper does.

1978
02:30:51,687 --> 02:30:53,389
[SPEAKER_17]: When you add your fries to it, you're adding on another 300.

1979
02:30:53,529 --> 02:30:58,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Right there, you have in your hands the entire equivalent of a day's meal.

1980
02:30:59,253 --> 02:31:00,795
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, an entire...

1981
02:31:02,717 --> 02:31:05,879
[SPEAKER_17]: You have your whole day of eating in one meal.

1982
02:31:07,119 --> 02:31:11,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Changing your coke from regular to diet, you're basically removing 200 calories of that.

1983
02:31:11,982 --> 02:31:13,963
[SPEAKER_17]: That's incredibly stupid, but you know what?

1984
02:31:14,063 --> 02:31:15,043
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how they make their money.

1985
02:31:16,664 --> 02:31:19,225
[SPEAKER_26]: I drink 300 calorie hot chocolate.

1986
02:31:22,707 --> 02:31:24,007
[SPEAKER_17]: You're getting some dairy from it.

1987
02:31:25,308 --> 02:31:26,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, it's instant hot chocolate.

1988
02:31:28,229 --> 02:31:29,390
[SPEAKER_17]: They have enzymes in them.

1989
02:31:30,979 --> 02:31:33,301
[SPEAKER_26]: It's so chocolatey and good, I can't deny it.

1990
02:31:33,841 --> 02:31:38,204
[SPEAKER_26]: It's actually three packets of hot chocolate mix, because one and two are just not enough.

1991
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, chocolate is good for your endorphins.

1992
02:31:41,446 --> 02:31:44,367
[SPEAKER_17]: It helps you release happy chemicals.

1993
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Sounds happy.

1994
02:31:46,629 --> 02:31:48,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's a aphrodisiac.

1995
02:31:50,683 --> 02:31:51,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

1996
02:32:09,366 --> 02:32:12,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should make this a regular thing, you know, health talk.

1997
02:32:13,469 --> 02:32:15,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Health chat, DDR dieting, workout mode.

1998
02:32:15,971 --> 02:32:16,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, seriously.

1999
02:32:16,792 --> 02:32:17,292
[SPEAKER_04]: On Orange Lounge.

2000
02:32:17,312 --> 02:32:22,195
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it also goes hand-in-hand with playing, you know, the DDR and pata pata.

2001
02:32:22,296 --> 02:32:25,518
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is why I agree that this topic's kind of, you know, relevant.

2002
02:32:25,718 --> 02:32:28,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually really is relevant to the Bonnie community.

2003
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:31,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like I said, a lot of people play Bonnie to stay fit.

2004
02:32:31,282 --> 02:32:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the things that appeal to them about the game.

2005
02:32:33,904 --> 02:32:36,426
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm mad at Golfland because they're trying to make me impotent.

2006
02:32:36,446 --> 02:32:37,807
[SPEAKER_26]: Blank.

2007
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:41,843
[SPEAKER_26]: Link, they got rid of my surge and replaced it with Mountain Dew.

2008
02:32:43,645 --> 02:32:45,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Mountain Dew's bad.

2009
02:32:45,406 --> 02:32:46,307
[SPEAKER_26]: It tastes like pee.

2010
02:32:47,147 --> 02:32:48,328
[SPEAKER_26]: I want my surge.

2011
02:32:48,509 --> 02:32:50,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, I don't drink... That's the nickname Mountain Spew.

2012
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:52,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I ever drink is Mountain Dew.

2013
02:32:52,892 --> 02:32:54,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Mountain Spew.

2014
02:32:54,273 --> 02:32:56,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Mountain Dew really make you impotent?

2015
02:32:57,916 --> 02:33:00,478
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just all the yellow sticks or whatever it is.

2016
02:33:00,498 --> 02:33:02,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't really going to matter for me anyway, but...

2017
02:33:04,029 --> 02:33:06,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, they're saying sushi is good.

2018
02:33:06,771 --> 02:33:10,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And Orange Beanie says the only meat he'll eat is sushi on occasion.

2019
02:33:11,073 --> 02:33:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Swift Rock says McDonald's should get sushi.

2020
02:33:14,315 --> 02:33:21,799
[SPEAKER_17]: McDonald's would, then you'd get like, you'd get like the imitation crab wrapped up in cabbage instead of nori.

2021
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:26,081
[SPEAKER_17]: And an old bun to replace the rice.

2022
02:33:26,461 --> 02:33:29,683
[SPEAKER_17]: If you, if you did get rice crackers and soak them in water.

2023
02:33:30,783 --> 02:33:36,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Not, well, not, you know, the big rice cakes and soak them in water and then wrap those around a piece of imitation crab meat and cover it in cabbage.

2024
02:33:38,146 --> 02:33:43,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being told to look at a Gran Turismo Vice City story I apparently missed that was going on.

2025
02:33:44,009 --> 02:33:45,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo Vice City, shit!

2026
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:49,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, um... You fucker, you're going faster, man, we're gonna kill you!

2027
02:33:49,732 --> 02:33:54,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, SoCalKick says he was watching Channel 4 and this was the explanation of Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2028
02:33:55,274 --> 02:33:55,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say Grand Theft Auto?

2029
02:33:55,954 --> 02:33:56,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2030
02:33:56,415 --> 02:33:57,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2031
02:33:57,075 --> 02:33:58,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, that's right, there was supposed to be a news report on that.

2032
02:33:58,835 --> 02:34:06,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on Channel 4 they said, in the new Grand Theft Auto Vice City, players must beat women, kill police, and have sex with prostitutes to progress in the game.

2033
02:34:06,819 --> 02:34:07,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no.

2034
02:34:08,619 --> 02:34:09,480
[SPEAKER_26]: Kill police, yes.

2035
02:34:11,266 --> 02:34:11,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's optional.

2036
02:34:12,006 --> 02:34:12,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Cop killer.

2037
02:34:12,847 --> 02:34:13,707
[SPEAKER_26]: That's optional.

2038
02:34:13,788 --> 02:34:18,490
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I always just, you know, I fire lots of rockets and watch people explode.

2039
02:34:19,271 --> 02:34:22,092
[SPEAKER_26]: This is how much I actually play PlayStation games, by the way.

2040
02:34:22,152 --> 02:34:24,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't catch my big fuck up there.

2041
02:34:24,194 --> 02:34:26,975
[SPEAKER_26]: That's not like, you know, a one-sided opinion there.

2042
02:34:27,315 --> 02:34:31,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you have to do this to, you know, what, first off... If you want the bonus stage, maybe.

2043
02:34:32,098 --> 02:34:33,819
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, first off, it's a complete lie.

2044
02:34:34,259 --> 02:34:35,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, complete lie right there.

2045
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:37,921
[SPEAKER_26]: Just totally slandering the game right there.

2046
02:34:39,502 --> 02:34:40,443
[SPEAKER_26]: Stupid bastards.

2047
02:34:40,563 --> 02:34:41,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh well, it doesn't matter.

2048
02:34:41,644 --> 02:34:42,384
[SPEAKER_26]: No matter what they say.

2049
02:34:42,424 --> 02:34:49,709
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, yeah, it's going to give them more ratings and more, you know, people are like, oh, cool, that game looks like fun and it's going to sell more copies.

2050
02:34:49,769 --> 02:34:55,532
[SPEAKER_26]: It was the highest selling, highest grossing game last year, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3.

2051
02:34:56,172 --> 02:34:57,593
[SPEAKER_26]: So now this time it's going to be even better.

2052
02:34:59,234 --> 02:35:00,215
[SPEAKER_26]: And it has a storyline.

2053
02:35:00,595 --> 02:35:02,596
[SPEAKER_26]: It has to do with a drug deal that went bad.

2054
02:35:04,197 --> 02:35:06,098
[SPEAKER_26]: And you have to go kill the people that stole your money.

2055
02:35:08,340 --> 02:35:08,720
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, thank you.

2056
02:35:09,232 --> 02:35:09,953
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2057
02:35:30,652 --> 02:35:31,973
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Max USA DDR Max USA

2058
02:35:54,275 --> 02:35:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2059
02:36:15,659 --> 02:36:18,401
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no excuse for bad customer service.

2060
02:36:19,041 --> 02:36:19,902
[SPEAKER_17]: And keep in mind this.

2061
02:36:20,422 --> 02:36:26,707
[SPEAKER_17]: For every one person who calls in and complains or does a physical complaint, there are eight more people who are displeased.

2062
02:36:27,607 --> 02:36:29,669
[SPEAKER_17]: And each of these people will go and tell more people.

2063
02:36:30,069 --> 02:36:33,311
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, if we had more activists in the world, stuff would change.

2064
02:36:33,951 --> 02:36:37,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think that that's my part in trying to make things a little bit better.

2065
02:36:38,365 --> 02:36:41,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamie and I didn't get to play Max in front of a bunch of strangers and we cry.

2066
02:36:42,907 --> 02:36:43,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a sniff.

2067
02:36:44,227 --> 02:36:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was kind of interesting how Fries has really been promoting DDR around here especially.

2068
02:36:49,529 --> 02:36:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a run.

2069
02:36:50,269 --> 02:36:54,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I literally, we watched what, like two or three people, at least I noticed this, I didn't really say anything to you about it.

2070
02:36:55,271 --> 02:37:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw, like, two or three people, no, not the ones playing the game, but, like, families picking up DDR and a dance pad, like, walking out there.

2071
02:37:02,874 --> 02:37:20,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And the employees, this is kind of smart, they did have an employee kind of stationed near the DDR, watching the people play, apparently not keeping very good track, but watching the people play, and then when parents would kind of look at it curiously, would go up and talk to them about DDR, and suddenly they're walking out of there with a copy of Max USA, and one of them was walking out with a PlayStation 2.

2072
02:37:20,722 --> 02:37:22,143
[SPEAKER_17]: My boss bought Konomics for herself.

2073
02:37:22,903 --> 02:37:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

2074
02:37:24,143 --> 02:37:25,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Make sure that you buy your games at GameStop.

2075
02:37:26,104 --> 02:37:26,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2076
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:28,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2077
02:37:29,344 --> 02:37:30,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Buy them at GameStop.

2078
02:37:30,685 --> 02:37:33,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Reserve your games at the GameStop in Richard Quarter.

2079
02:37:34,906 --> 02:37:36,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's trying to get a little bit of business there.

2080
02:37:36,826 --> 02:37:37,546
[SPEAKER_04]: For my man.

2081
02:37:37,726 --> 02:37:37,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2082
02:37:38,747 --> 02:37:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know.

2083
02:37:40,027 --> 02:37:43,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's a really great way to promote DDR.

2084
02:37:43,928 --> 02:37:45,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad more stores don't do that.

2085
02:37:46,451 --> 02:37:50,712
[SPEAKER_17]: I also did find another couple cool things at Fry's, speaking of our little trip to Fry's.

2086
02:37:51,012 --> 02:37:51,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2087
02:37:51,872 --> 02:37:53,853
[SPEAKER_17]: One of my favorite artists ever.

2088
02:37:54,013 --> 02:38:00,854
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't think that any of his stuff was released in the U.S., and I was wrong, because I found three DJ Crush CDs at Fry's.

2089
02:38:01,774 --> 02:38:02,855
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes me happy.

2090
02:38:03,855 --> 02:38:05,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw the super ghetto cheap CD burners.

2091
02:38:05,815 --> 02:38:06,415
[SPEAKER_04]: That made me happy.

2092
02:38:06,735 --> 02:38:06,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

2093
02:38:07,235 --> 02:38:08,136
[SPEAKER_17]: They were really cheap.

2094
02:38:08,916 --> 02:38:09,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2095
02:38:10,316 --> 02:38:12,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that was our Fry's story, and that's about it.

2096
02:38:13,257 --> 02:38:14,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Loki has something to share.

2097
02:38:16,707 --> 02:38:19,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Damn you Friesen making me sped money.

2098
02:38:19,393 --> 02:38:23,541
[SPEAKER_26]: I go there with an intent of buying one thing and I walk out with eight things.

2099
02:38:23,721 --> 02:38:24,763
[SPEAKER_26]: I hate you!

2100
02:38:25,725 --> 02:38:26,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Being so cheap!

2101
02:38:28,317 --> 02:38:29,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I got my man a really cool birthday present.

2102
02:38:30,018 --> 02:38:40,805
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the way, we need to give, even though he's not listening and stuff, I have to give a happy birthday to my fiancé Dan, because he's absolutely awesome.

2103
02:38:41,006 --> 02:38:41,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Aww.

2104
02:38:41,106 --> 02:38:52,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if ever you see him online, he's either online as NeoStrider, he used to run the NeoStrider Strider Zone, and he also goes by the handle GunstarHero a lot.

2105
02:38:52,373 --> 02:38:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: My man's an old school gamer.

2106
02:38:54,234 --> 02:38:57,757
[SPEAKER_17]: But he's going to be 27 on Friday, and I got him a really cool gift.

2107
02:38:58,657 --> 02:39:05,502
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if anyone has seen the little mini RC cars, like the Initial D cars and the Digi-Q cars.

2108
02:39:06,262 --> 02:39:08,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Fry's are selling the Digi-Q tracks, the Japanese ones.

2109
02:39:09,584 --> 02:39:11,065
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what I picked him up for his birthday.

2110
02:39:12,126 --> 02:39:12,486
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh-oh.

2111
02:39:13,227 --> 02:39:13,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Boom.

2112
02:39:14,267 --> 02:39:18,170
[SPEAKER_17]: So, happy birthday to my man, even though he's probably not listening.

2113
02:39:19,735 --> 02:39:21,917
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope he's not listening because I just told him his birthday present was.

2114
02:39:23,138 --> 02:39:23,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be bad, yes.

2115
02:39:24,999 --> 02:39:26,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play some stuff for you.

2116
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back to wrap up the rest of the show.

2117
02:39:31,944 --> 02:39:35,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start this one off with something a little bit disco.

2118
02:39:35,846 --> 02:39:37,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys kind of like this song.

2119
02:39:37,027 --> 02:39:37,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play this for you guys.

2120
02:39:38,528 --> 02:39:40,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be right back.

2121
02:41:35,530 --> 02:41:36,592
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2122
02:41:58,015 --> 02:41:58,997
Thank you for watching!

2123
02:42:17,151 --> 02:42:18,011
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2124
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:57,921
You don't need another one No matter how much I get hurt

2125
02:43:31,633 --> 02:43:32,614
Thank you for watching!

2126
02:44:00,695 --> 02:44:01,457
Thanks for watching!

2127
02:44:33,117 --> 02:44:36,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.

2128
02:44:36,659 --> 02:44:38,399
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a good place to listen to the music.

2129
02:44:43,171 --> 02:44:57,159
[SPEAKER_04]: You are back, and it's funny, in the chat room they're talking about this Gacked Another World sounds just like the Josie and the Pussycats song Three Small Words, and they're absolutely right, because that racked my brain for an entire day one time.

2130
02:44:57,419 --> 02:44:58,560
[SPEAKER_17]: It's okay, but it's better.

2131
02:45:00,785 --> 02:45:02,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like Another World a lot.

2132
02:45:02,326 --> 02:45:03,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and it is different.

2133
02:45:03,386 --> 02:45:04,226
[SPEAKER_04]: The chorus is a lot different.

2134
02:45:04,266 --> 02:45:05,627
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually did play the Gagged version.

2135
02:45:05,647 --> 02:45:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: The guitar is just very similar.

2136
02:45:06,547 --> 02:45:07,167
[SPEAKER_04]: The guitar is very similar.

2137
02:45:07,187 --> 02:45:08,808
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually did play the Gagged version, by the way.

2138
02:45:08,828 --> 02:45:11,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Which is the only good one that exists.

2139
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:17,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to relay a message to Loki from SoCalKicks, but I lost it, so retype that in the chatroom, SoCal, and I'll get that.

2140
02:45:21,473 --> 02:45:22,333
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it was more work.

2141
02:45:22,373 --> 02:45:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was something more about Grand Theft Auto.

2142
02:45:25,174 --> 02:45:26,535
[SPEAKER_26]: Eh, stupid news.

2143
02:45:27,330 --> 02:45:31,713
[SPEAKER_26]: All local news sucks because they're stupid and uninformed about anything current.

2144
02:45:31,753 --> 02:45:33,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Especially anything that has to do with gaming.

2145
02:45:34,014 --> 02:45:36,695
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, those crazy kids and their games.

2146
02:45:36,715 --> 02:45:38,176
[SPEAKER_26]: They're so stupid.

2147
02:45:39,217 --> 02:45:40,437
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2148
02:45:41,498 --> 02:45:42,238
[SPEAKER_17]: That was special.

2149
02:45:43,669 --> 02:45:44,049
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2150
02:46:03,241 --> 02:46:03,661
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

2151
02:46:23,044 --> 02:46:25,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is VidPower suggesting Animal Crossing Vice City?

2152
02:46:26,426 --> 02:46:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2153
02:46:27,186 --> 02:46:30,788
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be pretty funny though.

2154
02:46:30,808 --> 02:46:34,229
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be able to shoot Mallory finally.

2155
02:46:34,809 --> 02:46:35,690
[SPEAKER_17]: I like Mallory.

2156
02:46:35,710 --> 02:46:37,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd pop a cap in her ass.

2157
02:46:37,891 --> 02:46:38,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I like Mallory.

2158
02:46:39,091 --> 02:46:40,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Mallory gives me stuff all the time.

2159
02:46:42,513 --> 02:46:44,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Now what would be crazy is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2160
02:46:44,834 --> 02:46:46,875
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's okay because I like puddles and you don't like her.

2161
02:46:49,549 --> 02:46:52,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Black Lab wants to point out that the Boba at Boba, Max is broken.

2162
02:47:19,185 --> 02:47:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going there for Boba.

2163
02:47:20,226 --> 02:47:21,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going there for Boba.

2164
02:47:21,146 --> 02:47:21,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

2165
02:47:21,867 --> 02:47:22,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still coming.

2166
02:47:23,108 --> 02:47:23,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2167
02:47:23,989 --> 02:47:26,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is what SoCalKicks wanted to tell you.

2168
02:47:26,992 --> 02:47:28,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, that's what they do.

2169
02:47:28,233 --> 02:47:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you even know why every supermarket has milk in the back?

2170
02:47:31,395 --> 02:47:32,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a mental thing.

2171
02:47:33,317 --> 02:47:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people just go to a supermarket often just for milk.

2172
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,722
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's in the back, they have to go all the way to the back.

2173
02:47:38,962 --> 02:47:40,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for some reason to pick up other things.

2174
02:47:41,294 --> 02:47:46,604
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it's because they, they, you know, arrange supermarkets and stuff to promote buying.

2175
02:47:46,984 --> 02:47:47,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Duh.

2176
02:47:47,806 --> 02:47:52,915
[SPEAKER_26]: But, I mean, that has nothing to do with the fact that, you know, they're saying the game is, you know,

2177
02:47:54,568 --> 02:47:55,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, talking about Fry's, yeah.

2178
02:47:55,789 --> 02:47:55,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2179
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:59,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I don't know what that was exactly in reference to.

2180
02:47:59,252 --> 02:48:00,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, Fry's is like a giant maze.

2181
02:48:00,934 --> 02:48:04,957
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like a giant hedge maze that you have to walk through just to get to the checkout counter.

2182
02:48:05,558 --> 02:48:07,479
[SPEAKER_26]: Giant hedge maze, that's all you have to remember.

2183
02:48:07,759 --> 02:48:12,323
[SPEAKER_26]: But it's not the fact that they arrange stuff like that, it's just the fact that they're so cheap.

2184
02:48:12,824 --> 02:48:14,265
[SPEAKER_26]: So cheap that you can't resist.

2185
02:48:14,585 --> 02:48:16,207
[SPEAKER_26]: But the problem is, they're all mail-in rebates...

2186
02:48:17,168 --> 02:48:18,329
[SPEAKER_26]: PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3

2187
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:41,751
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, first thing I'm going to be doing is getting DDR Max 2 when that comes out.

2188
02:48:42,572 --> 02:48:46,196
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, I can rip everything from that and whatnot.

2189
02:48:46,276 --> 02:48:51,461
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm also, one of the first games I'm getting, which I'm also bidding on, is Para Para Para.

2190
02:48:52,663 --> 02:48:53,103
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not...

2191
02:48:58,869 --> 02:49:11,516
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, yeah, but there's, I don't know, there's a bunch of other games, like, you guys are trying to get me into Beatmania 2DX, and I'm thinking that's an expensive investment for something I'm not too excited to be playing, but, I don't know.

2192
02:49:11,536 --> 02:49:19,580
[SPEAKER_26]: There's also the Drummania, um, drum, I wanted to get the drum set for that, and, uh, maybe Drummania or something, I don't know.

2193
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:19,960
[SPEAKER_26]: What was it again?

2194
02:49:21,055 --> 02:49:21,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Session Mode is so cool.

2195
02:49:21,776 --> 02:49:22,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2196
02:49:22,116 --> 02:49:24,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, being told that Grand Theft Auto Crime Online is said to be real.

2197
02:49:24,639 --> 02:49:24,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh.

2198
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:25,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Hide your children!

2199
02:49:40,501 --> 02:49:43,402
[SPEAKER_04]: and Loki, you don't want Para Para, it gets boring in three days.

2200
02:49:43,662 --> 02:49:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm not sure if he's talking about Para or Drum Mania, but he's saying, you don't want it, it gets boring in three days, that's DCB.

2201
02:49:48,464 --> 02:49:52,606
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I know that, duh, I don't play games like after three days anyways.

2202
02:49:53,226 --> 02:50:00,449
[SPEAKER_26]: Another reason why I'd want Para Para is just for the controller, because I get to use it with Step Mania, and oh yeah, I get to put some crazy shit in there.

2203
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:06,432
[SPEAKER_26]: Basically, it'd be like a really tripped out version of Dance Maniacs.

2204
02:50:06,452 --> 02:50:08,793
[SPEAKER_26]: They'll have to do it for now until I... He is talking about Para.

2205
02:50:09,386 --> 02:50:10,707
[SPEAKER_26]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2206
02:50:27,535 --> 02:50:28,736
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2207
02:50:28,756 --> 02:50:29,517
[SPEAKER_17]: You got the name wrong.

2208
02:50:29,597 --> 02:50:29,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2209
02:50:30,037 --> 02:50:31,338
[SPEAKER_17]: The Pink Biscuits of Death.

2210
02:50:31,518 --> 02:50:32,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pink Biscuits of Death.

2211
02:50:32,979 --> 02:50:33,980
[SPEAKER_17]: I like pink pancakes.

2212
02:50:35,001 --> 02:50:37,483
[SPEAKER_17]: They're too big to be pancakes.

2213
02:50:37,643 --> 02:50:38,584
[SPEAKER_26]: They're fat pancakes.

2214
02:50:38,764 --> 02:50:43,487
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, they were saying also that I should get, um, what was it, um, Kingdom Hearts International when that comes out.

2215
02:50:44,488 --> 02:50:46,490
[SPEAKER_26]: And Final Fantasy International.

2216
02:50:46,590 --> 02:50:48,511
[SPEAKER_26]: Hell, I can get Final Fantasy XI right now, I guess.

2217
02:50:49,392 --> 02:50:51,454
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know why I'd want to, but... Oh, he's...

2218
02:50:53,786 --> 02:50:58,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Swiftrock is offering to give away his Parapara for a Milpitas Golfland token.

2219
02:51:00,228 --> 02:51:00,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2220
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:04,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2221
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:13,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, go ahead and email the show at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll forward that on to Loki and you guys can set that up.

2222
02:51:13,533 --> 02:51:15,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you might have a Golfland token to spare.

2223
02:51:16,254 --> 02:51:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2224
02:51:16,774 --> 02:51:17,315
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.

2225
02:51:17,335 --> 02:51:18,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get one.

2226
02:51:18,875 --> 02:51:19,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Look up at the wall.

2227
02:51:19,876 --> 02:51:21,257
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually have a Gothland token.

2228
02:51:21,277 --> 02:51:23,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a Gothland token sitting right up on the wall.

2229
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have that.

2230
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:25,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You can borrow it to get the para-para.

2231
02:51:25,281 --> 02:51:27,443
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll just take two para-para controllers.

2232
02:51:27,503 --> 02:51:30,206
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think you can, like, do something with that.

2233
02:51:30,226 --> 02:51:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play two people para-para.

2234
02:51:32,168 --> 02:51:32,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

2235
02:51:32,568 --> 02:51:33,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a para-party.

2236
02:51:35,504 --> 02:51:39,846
[SPEAKER_26]: Paraparty, it'll go well with the masturbation party.

2237
02:51:41,687 --> 02:51:45,568
[SPEAKER_26]: By the way, by the way, by the way, MakeEditGetPorn is still on.

2238
02:51:46,429 --> 02:51:50,310
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh, yeah, I haven't really thought of a date yet that I want to judge everything.

2239
02:51:50,570 --> 02:51:51,791
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just being lazy, so.

2240
02:51:52,291 --> 02:51:55,592
[SPEAKER_26]: In the meantime, MakeEdit, for anything that's on, MaxUSA.

2241
02:51:56,213 --> 02:52:03,115
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't care how you make it, just get me a step chart or edit file or DWI or step menu file somehow.

2242
02:52:03,896 --> 02:52:04,276
[SPEAKER_26]: And, uh,

2243
02:52:04,716 --> 02:52:06,057
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and I'll enter it in.

2244
02:52:06,997 --> 02:52:07,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do it!

2245
02:52:08,118 --> 02:52:09,259
[SPEAKER_26]: And you can get porn!

2246
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:11,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Pornography.

2247
02:52:13,341 --> 02:52:13,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2248
02:52:14,362 --> 02:52:15,382
[SPEAKER_17]: It's faptastic!

2249
02:52:15,683 --> 02:52:20,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a faptastic contest being brought to you by the one and only Loki.

2250
02:52:20,546 --> 02:52:25,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, it's being suggested we should invite Paula Terry to our Pear Pear Paradise party slash masturbation party.

2251
02:52:25,529 --> 02:52:25,909
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2252
02:52:26,649 --> 02:52:27,390
[SPEAKER_17]: God, no.

2253
02:52:27,950 --> 02:52:29,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless we get to, like, take shots at her.

2254
02:52:31,741 --> 02:52:32,001
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

2255
02:52:32,021 --> 02:52:40,586
[SPEAKER_26]: She can't sing, but you know, if she were to be, like, I don't know, gagged somehow, I'll let your mind do the work.

2256
02:52:40,606 --> 02:52:41,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some Paraparadise you can gag her with?

2257
02:52:44,386 --> 02:52:45,467
[SPEAKER_26]: I got a pink biscuit for ya!

2258
02:52:46,707 --> 02:52:47,868
[SPEAKER_26]: Stick the mic closer.

2259
02:52:48,708 --> 02:52:49,248
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

2260
02:52:49,909 --> 02:52:51,049
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah, you know you like it.

2261
02:52:52,170 --> 02:52:58,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're getting close to the end of the show here, so I thought I'd go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.

2262
02:52:58,252 --> 02:53:00,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, Matt, you are one sick fuck.

2263
02:53:00,694 --> 02:53:02,654
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Jamie's final thought, is Matt is a sick fuck?

2264
02:53:04,956 --> 02:53:05,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2265
02:53:07,276 --> 02:53:08,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

2266
02:53:08,777 --> 02:53:10,238
[SPEAKER_26]: Loki, your final thought for the day.

2267
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:13,360
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh... I don't know.

2268
02:53:14,401 --> 02:53:15,021
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm tired.

2269
02:53:15,502 --> 02:53:16,022
[SPEAKER_26]: You're tired.

2270
02:53:16,062 --> 02:53:16,962
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Gendo.

2271
02:53:17,223 --> 02:53:17,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, that's right.

2272
02:53:18,243 --> 02:53:19,504
[SPEAKER_26]: My bitches will do anything.

2273
02:53:20,625 --> 02:53:21,405
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, maybe not that.

2274
02:53:25,448 --> 02:53:28,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Bradley, have any... My women are always on top.

2275
02:53:29,210 --> 02:53:29,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And...

2276
02:53:36,806 --> 02:53:37,546
[SPEAKER_27]: Final Thought of the Day.

2277
02:53:37,647 --> 02:53:39,928
[SPEAKER_27]: Run away, run away, run, run far away, and then run back.

2278
02:53:41,169 --> 02:53:41,449
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

2279
02:53:42,609 --> 02:53:43,710
[SPEAKER_15]: That was great.

2280
02:53:44,510 --> 02:53:45,791
[SPEAKER_15]: That was great.

2281
02:53:47,512 --> 02:53:48,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get it.

2282
02:53:49,413 --> 02:53:50,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Gendo, are you a pimp?

2283
02:53:51,594 --> 02:53:51,935
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

2284
02:53:54,556 --> 02:53:55,557
[SPEAKER_26]: That didn't do anything.

2285
02:53:55,837 --> 02:53:56,117
[SPEAKER_26]: I know.

2286
02:53:56,337 --> 02:53:57,418
[SPEAKER_26]: I just like that song.

2287
02:53:59,156 --> 02:54:00,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Attention, Kmart shoppers.

2288
02:54:02,258 --> 02:54:04,480
[SPEAKER_26]: Attention, attention, Kmart shoppers.

2289
02:54:04,740 --> 02:54:06,601
[SPEAKER_26]: This is Gendo.

2290
02:54:07,421 --> 02:54:11,784
[SPEAKER_26]: Please report to my office for breast inspection.

2291
02:54:13,465 --> 02:54:14,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn it, I hate this part.

2292
02:54:16,687 --> 02:54:17,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, baby.

2293
02:54:19,116 --> 02:54:28,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the scene in that where Shinji's in front of the elevator and the elevator opens and it's the Gendo music and then it closes and the music goes away.

2294
02:54:28,858 --> 02:54:34,840
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about an anime parody of Evangelion called Evangelion Re-Death.

2295
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:37,540
[SPEAKER_17]: It's completely on crack.

2296
02:54:37,820 --> 02:54:41,021
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where the It's Gendo line comes from in the intro.

2297
02:54:41,161 --> 02:54:41,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

2298
02:54:42,561 --> 02:54:44,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're just quoting it because we can.

2299
02:54:44,822 --> 02:54:45,642
[SPEAKER_15]: We're nerds.

2300
02:54:46,482 --> 02:54:50,083
[SPEAKER_26]: The best one, though, has to be Fanboy Bebop.

2301
02:54:50,323 --> 02:54:52,824
[SPEAKER_26]: That is, oh, so funny.

2302
02:54:54,285 --> 02:54:54,825
[SPEAKER_26]: So funny.

2303
02:54:54,865 --> 02:55:02,607
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, it starts off, the whole thing shows this ship, and it shows, like, his anime collection, and it says, you know, like, Sailor Moon and stuff, and then it's all hentai.

2304
02:55:03,728 --> 02:55:07,369
[SPEAKER_26]: And it shows, like, this long hallway full of videos, and it's all hentai.

2305
02:55:07,949 --> 02:55:09,129
[SPEAKER_26]: It's hilarious.

2306
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:10,750
[SPEAKER_26]: Definitely watch it.

2307
02:55:11,451 --> 02:55:15,316
[SPEAKER_17]: What else I have on that tape is Jube Powers, International Man of Intercourse.

2308
02:55:15,837 --> 02:55:17,980
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucks, but I love the part with the looping ninjas.

2309
02:55:19,121 --> 02:55:20,203
[SPEAKER_17]: That part was funny.

2310
02:55:21,024 --> 02:55:26,111
[SPEAKER_15]: The looped animation of the ninja running in and out with the 70s porn music.

2311
02:55:26,468 --> 02:55:28,769
[SPEAKER_04]: JB wanted to share something with us all.

2312
02:55:29,870 --> 02:55:31,531
[SPEAKER_04]: JB wanted to share this with us all.

2313
02:55:31,611 --> 02:55:35,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Politary.com Is this the same one?

2314
02:55:35,433 --> 02:55:35,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

2315
02:55:36,414 --> 02:55:37,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might be.

2316
02:55:37,454 --> 02:55:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, under the events section you'll find information regarding different performances in and around Japan.

2317
02:55:42,957 --> 02:55:43,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and you can email her.

2318
02:55:45,973 --> 02:55:48,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh yeah.

2319
02:55:49,117 --> 02:55:50,760
[SPEAKER_26]: She looks sort of like Phoebe.

2320
02:55:52,382 --> 02:55:53,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Smelly cat.

2321
02:55:54,425 --> 02:55:55,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Smelly cat.

2322
02:55:56,288 --> 02:55:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Smelly cat.

2323
02:55:59,112 --> 02:55:59,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2324
02:55:59,533 --> 02:56:00,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see Politary's bio.

2325
02:56:01,769 --> 02:56:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Apollo was born in Australia in a musical family with his famous opera singer mother and a highly skilled classical guitarist brother.

2326
02:56:07,115 --> 02:56:09,859
[SPEAKER_04]: She began vocal training at the age of 6 and lived in France until the age of 16.

2327
02:56:09,899 --> 02:56:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold that thought right there.

2328
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:10,960
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2329
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:18,749
[SPEAKER_26]: Where she was then sold to slave trader Naoki, where she became his sex slash singing...

2330
02:56:20,170 --> 02:56:20,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, she's married!

2331
02:56:22,132 --> 02:56:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, does my wedding count under events?

2332
02:56:24,214 --> 02:56:26,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to go with this a little more next week.

2333
02:56:26,296 --> 02:56:28,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say anything about Bomani, I see.

2334
02:56:29,199 --> 02:56:30,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go, Love Again Tonight's in there.

2335
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:31,661
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, well, didn't you hear?

2336
02:56:31,781 --> 02:56:33,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Naoki's Naoki Terry now.

2337
02:56:34,383 --> 02:56:34,984
[SPEAKER_26]: He took her name.

2338
02:56:37,266 --> 02:56:41,150
