00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Why did they have to take the word gay?

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
No! What I expect for Spanish exposition is gentle.

16

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
Orange Lounge Radio

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,960
We are live and this is episode number 21 for November the 24th of 2002.

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,320
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most fanky radio station of all things Bimani.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,200
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
What's up, my brother?

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Also in the studio, say hello too. Is it Jenny's bitch or is it Jamie's bitch? We don't know, but the initials are JB.

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,200
That's all you want to say is hello?

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Moo.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Moo, okay.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
We'll be talking to everybody more a bit later.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
We're just going to take a really quick break.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Any other opening thoughts from you folks here?

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
You know, I don't think the parrot noises pick up very well over the radio, actually.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know, though.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I could burn up.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
You can hear a little bit of it?

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I don't know.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I don't listen to this show.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, we have a brand- oh, oh.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
You know what?

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
Everybody who un-listens at home, give me food.

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
You want food right now?

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,760
What were you craving before the show started?

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,860
Artichoke hearts.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,280
I want a pizza with garlic sauce and artichoke hearts.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Is that a PMS thing?

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Alright, we'll be right back after this very quick break.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,280
I would like our listeners to know that Robin King falls.

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
They're big and fluffy

50
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:40,440
Before we get into the next song, I'd like to make a real quick announcement, kind of

51
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
tease our next segment.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,080
Rob was eating balls.

53
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,600
Well, other than that I was eating balls.

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
I'd like to announce that after these next two songs, when we come back to the next segment,

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,740
i'm going to come out live on air

56
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,760
uh... it's time for me to come out of the closet and i will be doing that live

57
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,900

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100

99,000 red balloons

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200

the claw machine springs to life

70
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,200
It opens up one eager eye For boosting it on the sky

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Ninety-nine red balloons go by Ninety-nine red balloons go by

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:07:05,720
This is what we've waited for This is it, boy, this is war

73
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,220
The president is on the line

74
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,720

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Everyone's a silver hero, everyone's a Captain Cook

79
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,720
With all us to identify, terrify and classify

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,220
Scramble in the summer sky

81
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,720
Ninety-nine red balloons go by

82
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,720
Ninety-nine red balloons go by

83
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,720
Ninety-nine dreams I have had

Everyone red balloon

85
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's all over and I'm standing pretty

86
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
In this dust I was a city

87
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,720
If I could find a souvenir

88
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Just to prove the world was here

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
And here is a red balloon

90
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll think of you and let it go

91
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:15,720
It's up to you, she said to me She knew I wanted to be free

92
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:24,720
And everybody there began to stare As the ladies started crying

93
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Let's hit it like a fake Let's hit it like a fake

94
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
The atmosphere of peace and passion

95
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,720
In a free and easy smudge on the carpet

96
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Niko meow Niko meow

97
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:47,120
That's right. As we promised during the last break it's time for me to stop hiding secrets from everyone here assembled in the room, and all those assembled in the chat room. I need to stop lying to myself about some thing.

98
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,840
I have to admit this live on air I I like something that a lot of people say

99
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:20,680
I shouldn't like and people are telling me it's wrong that I feel this way and

100
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:29,920
that I like these kinds of things but I have to say you guys I I just can't get

101
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:39,920
enough of it. I, I really do like Polteri's tie from Sick Style. There. I said it. Oh

102
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:50,920
God, I'm so sorry, Mom and Dad. I'm so sorry. I hate her. I wish she would burn in hell.

103
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,920
In fact, it still holds true, okay? You don't know that all Polteri fans are going to burn

104
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
You're gonna burn in hell. Who are you to judge?

105
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Listen, don't judge me. You don't know me.

106
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm still holding a bounty for her dead.

107
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Bring her head to me and you'll be paid with vast riches of the lens.

108
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
You don't know shit.

109
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Ah, there. I feel much better now that I've come out on radio.

110
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I was so... I was so invigorating. Thank you.

111
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Oh yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
No, you're not. You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.

113
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Episode 21!

114
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
You're listening to all of Politary all the time!

115
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Before your ears bleed.

116
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Actually, because of Jamie's order that she issued last week on the show,

117
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Politary has been banned from the station for an entire year.

118
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
That little 30 second clip...

119
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
At least for the rest of the year.

120
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
For the rest of the year.

121
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
That little 30 second clip that you heard right there is about all you're going to hear.

122
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
And that does make me sad.

123
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
That makes me sad.

124
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,400
because I'm sorry that is the best version of time I will have a cry I'm

125
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,640
gonna go have a cry the beefy you girls can sing better than her no come on oh

126
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,840
come on she cannot hold a key neither can the beef for you which would make

127
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,440
superhero be that much better that's my impression to be for you no you're a

128
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,820
Eurobeat superhero be it's got beef for you and Polteri what more evil do you

129
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,980
and die. You guys are so mean.

130
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,540
No we're not, we're being honest.

131
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,540
Really so.

132
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,420
Let's start the show off tonight in a different kind of way.

133
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,580
Because we usually kind of wait for the end of the show to talk about this but I

134
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,300
thought we'll

135
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,180
switch things around, we'll do this at the beginning. Let's talk about the Sim Update for this week.

136
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,860
I was gonna say, you mean we're not talking about porn right away? No, we gotta say that for later.

137
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Okay, sim update. Well, we can do that.

138
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Let's see, obviously the most prominent thing going on right now is Turnimix 3.

139
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Entries are actually being accepted right now and until December 20th, so get your stuff in there.

140
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,860
No, I actually played Step Mania for the first time outside of your simulator,

141
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,860
because I've played your simulator at various parties that you've been at and you brought it to.

142
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Outside of your simulator, I actually sat down, I downloaded Step Mania,

143
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,860
and I actually played it for the first time in I don't know how long.

144
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,860
And, you know what? It's pretty damn cool. I don't know what I've been missing out on, but, um, okay.

145
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Anyways, um, yeah, actually, uh, one of the things that's gonna be coming up pretty soon in some of the updates for StepMania is, uh, support for BeatMania.

146
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Uh, so that's gonna be good. So you're gonna see support for BeatMania probably soon after will be Dance Maniacs and Poppin' Music.

147
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
And they'll be the all-encompassing Bimani Sim.

148
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,860
The word for that? Squeak.

149
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:23,460
So, look for that soon. Other things that should be noted, visit DDR UK. I mean, they've

150
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,940
got tons of sync sets that they're releasing now. They have pretty much everything. They're

151
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,060
doing some of the older, you know, one through, you know, five mix stuff. So, go check that

152
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,460
out. Also, check out, I believe, in the DDR Maniacs chat room, they're going to be hosting

153
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,260
files. They have one zip that's all of the ManiRuler stuff that you released in 2002.

154
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,980

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,940

167
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,460
set me as a good

168
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,720
find that somewhere

169
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,500
uh... supposed to be i guess it's out there somewhere it's out there somewhere

170
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,720
i don't know where since the fact that i have but yet remixed three for sure

171
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
uh... is going to be

172
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,420
definitely keep your eye on that they've got a bunch categories including one

173
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
now they actually pay to get into flight

174
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,140
you know those people are really professional making files

175
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,420
i'm actually

176
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,960
considering entering, I'm not sure yet.

177
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,060
I did, now you saw that I did my very first step file.

178
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,240
Yes. My very first one, you got to see it. You know what's sad?

179
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,580
I mean, let's just put it this way. I have to say your step file is the most synced step file I've ever seen.

180
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,220
Every time I play that I get AAA.

181
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,120
I guess that's a good thing. You know what though? I, I, there was a really nice guide

182
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,400
online and I, I'll have to find it for you guys later in the show because I don't have it up in front of me right now.

183
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,520
Actually, no wait, I think I have the damn thing bookmarked.

184
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,400
Hold on, let me, let me pull up my bookmarks. I think my site, because it was good. So I want to give props to this guy.

185
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,540
Who wrote it because I actually use this to sync it it looks like the guy who wrote it is

186
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,080
Raiden I thought it was always spelled the other way around, but it's the real name is Steven unfred wrote this file

187
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,780
About how to sync a DWI and well actually he's talking about DWI not step mania

188
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,180
But it was very helpful for me to sync this file

189
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,260
That I did so it was you know you had to go in the goldway

190
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,660
you have to count the beats and do a little math, but this thing kind of walks you through

191
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,060
it, the logic and everything, it was very helpful. So props to this guy for writing

192
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,700
the file because that really helped me in syncing that.

193
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Really sync?

194
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,620
Oh yeah, I will copy, yes, for those of you in our chat room, and if you're not in our

195
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,860
chat room, why the hell aren't you? You should get your booty on over to orangelounge.skie.cx

196
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,700
and then just click on chat. And then that will get you in our chat room, and for those

197
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
in the chat room, I posted the link right there.

198
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
And aren't you lucky you're there?

199
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
there?

200
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,980
Uh, see, other stuff that's, um, going on right now, um, see, well, it's not really,

201
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:19,880
I guess, simulator-related, but it is a pretty big thing, um, ddrspot.com is relaunched,

202
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,860
so, uh, you know, we'll definitely go check that out, the site is beautiful.

203
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,780
We'll talk a little more about that stuff later.

204
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,180
uh... and finally

205
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,980
i don't know how to exactly describe this but uh...

206
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,740
the year pc character set nine is releasing

207
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,540
okay just spit out looking into characters it is

208
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,560
mister spanky

209
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,900
mister spanky the bd r dot this is a great deal of the bodies queen okay

210
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,260
this guy i mean

211
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,020
What the hell are they thinking?

212
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,620
What is this? I mean they've got this guy who's like he's in all leather

213
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,780
like straps, okay? He's got a mohawk and big like

214
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,260
huge lips full of lipstick. Mr. Spanky.

215
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,740
And then you've got the chick, she's in all like leather and stuff with like horns in her hair.

216
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,380
I mean that's some scary shit. I'm trying to find the DDRPC site right now so we can bring it up.

217
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,380
What kind of sick fucks work at Konami of America? That's all I gotta say.

218
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,700
sick people there. I'm trying to find the BDR, sorry guys. There it is, Dance Dance Revolution

219
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,500
product site, and downloads, and character downloads, because that's all they actually

220
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,500
released. They were too lazy to release songs. That's okay. Yeah, Jason Enos and Mr. Spanky.

221
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,980
The white man always smiting out the black man, did you notice that? Well, they also

222
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,980
I also edited set number seven to remove the skull from Robby and put this stupid like...

223
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
I don't even know what kind of head it is.

224
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Why did they do that? They have to edit the skull thing, but yet they have Mr. Spanky!

225
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Well, we know where their focus lies in freaking Bondage Freaks.

226
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Because those aren't the first ones that they've released that were Bondage Freaks.

227
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,980
You've got Koby and Nicky look pretty Koby-ish.

228
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:21,980
But yeah, it's a sad day, but I don't know, what can you do?

229
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Maybe we'll talk to Mr. Spanky later in the program.

230
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Maybe Mr. Spanky can offer us some advice.

231
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I think Mr. Spanky's a big fan of Orange Lounge Radio, actually, from what I hear.

232
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,980
So we'll talk to Mr. Spanky a little bit later.

233
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Maybe Mr. Spanky will just kind of pop in during one of our breaks and offer you all some good advice.

234
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Because lord knows a lot of you nerds out there could use it.

235
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,980
Back on the subject of Tourney Mix 3, Rob's file there, he sent it over to me and I decided to go ahead and do a background for him.

236
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,980
I actually like it. It looks pretty cool. It's very colorful now.

237
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
Which one?

238
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
The background for your song?

239
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Oh, yes. You did a very excellent job with that background.

240
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,980
I'll actually play the song I did in Etude starting the next break so everybody can hear it.

241
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
And I'm still working on it?

242
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,980
Although I'm not entering Tourney Mix 3 with that. I'm still debating if I even want to enter it at all because I'm shy.

243
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Do it anyways, just do it in light if you're going to do it.

244
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
I mean, that's cool.

245
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
And I'm entering mine in Alien World.

246
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm working on the steps, actually, right now.

247
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
So, it'll be cool.

248
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Very cool!

249
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Are you looking at something pretty, Jamie?

250
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,980
There was a piece of lint floating in the air next to me.

251
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,980
You really care about the Sim update, don't you?

252
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Um, yeah.

253
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
I...

254
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
What, the Sims?

255
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Are you talking about Animal Crossing?

256
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
No.

257
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,180
Also, I'll be announcing this later on, something that has to do with my sim, and a further

258
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,020
evolution of my sim, we'll get into that later on.

259
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,280
Alright, so, um, sim stuff, yeah, so you are going to be entering tournament mix 3, I'm

260
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,060
debating it, Jamie doesn't really play the sim, so you probably won't be entering tournament

261
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
mix 3.

262
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,260
Does that mean that I get to, like, mix stuff up and sit at home?

263
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Yeah, you should enter tournament mix 3.

264
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
I don't have time to do any of that.

265
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
It does take a long time. I'll say that.

266
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
We should do a bunch of DXY edits.

267
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Put another up there and see what people...

268
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Well, you have to do a new song.

269
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
You have to make an... Don't you?

270
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Screw that.

271
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You can't do a song that's already existing.

272
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
I'll do it off the gachamanota.

273
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
No, you could do...

274
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
You could do a dance file to Schlagwerk

275
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
because nobody's ever done one.

276
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Oh, really?

277
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
My bad.

278
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Both the terror and the regular one.

279
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:43,260
I would pick one of the old Mega Ranger theme songs, if I had to.

280
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Oh, we have a new person in our chat room that says that they also have this ferret.

281
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Brack2000 also owns the infamous ferret that we like to play here on the show.

282
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Jamie likes to stroke it here on the show. I'm sorry, JB?

283
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Bush Baby.

284
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
Bush Baby.

285
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,260
It just had a fun time.

286
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,540
Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you'd want to hear that wonderful news that Bush Baby

287
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
has a twin.

288
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Yay!

289
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Bush Baby has a twin.

290
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,660
It's Rob, so I just play with it.

291
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,340
It was a present.

292
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,980
I also ended up in somebody's lap here while he was quite drunk.

293
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Oh?

294
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Remember?

295
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Never mind.

296
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
What?

297
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
No, what?

298
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
What?

299
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
When...

300
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Oh.

301
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,180
We need to do another drug show.

302
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
We really need to.

303
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,480
So we're going to have to pre-tape a show, so I'm thinking we ought to pre-tape a drunk

304
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
show at some point.

305
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
That sounds like a winner.

306
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,460
That might be a winner, because I'm actually going to be gone the week between Christmas

307
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,200
and New Year's, so we'll probably do some kind of pre-taped drunk show.

308
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,600
What more appropriate time than the holidays to be doing a drunk show?

309
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
So we'll see.

310
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
We'll see.

311
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
All right.

312
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
That's nice, twin.

313
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Yay.

314
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Hooray.

315
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
You're special.

316
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Yay.

317
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Hooray.

318
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
You're special.

319
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,080
Go shave your hands.

320
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,720
Let's see.

321
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,120
What else should we talk about here?

322
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Let's talk about...

323
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,200
No, we're not going to talk about Jenny Rom.

324
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Let's talk about...

325
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,360
This kind of goes along with the whole Sim thing, and Loki was alluding to this a little

326
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
bit ago.

327
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,840
There's a brand new version of DDR out there that you may not have heard of, because it's

328
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,040
not official.

329
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,080
It's quite a bootleg.

330
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,640
But I know you all out there have always wanted to dance to Britney Spears, and you've always

331
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,760
wanted to dance to Eminem and Christina Aguilera.

332
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
I feel sorry for you people.

333
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,080
Loki, tell us more about DDR Top Hits.

334
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:49,080
It's a piece of crap that they, uh, you know, made very, uh, I don't know. They didn't really put much work into it, looks like.

335
00:24:49,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Um, it's basically a hacked fourth mix upgrade that they made, and it's crap. They just replaced the images and replaced the songs. It doesn't even look like they even touched the steps at all, so.

336
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,080
It's a piece of crap. It's got, like, Christina Aguilera in it, Britney Spears.

337
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
That makes it a piece of crap instantly.

338
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,440
It's just it's just sad very very sad. I see no doubt. I wonder if that's old-school. No doubt or new-school. I'll doubt. What do you think?

339
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,880
I don't know who knows who cares

340
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
It's just it's crap

341
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
It's what they now on the actual website ddrtop hits.com

342
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,160
You can actually see they have screenshots there, and if you look really closely on one of them where it shows a song

343
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,480
The song selection screen, you'll actually see one of the songs, I believe it's Boyz

344
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,280
by Britney Spears, it says 1234007 as the actual song title, because they're dumbasses

345
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,760
and don't know actually how to hack the stupid thing.

346
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,360
And it also has the dance mania banner, might I add.

347
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,120
So doesn't this look like a bad Photoshop job to anybody else?

348
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,200
No, actually, that's what I was alluding to earlier.

349
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,640
I was talking with our fellow DDR Tech guy, Keith, down at Scandia, and they were actually

350
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,960
talking about upgrading their 4th mix to this piece of shit.

351
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,340
So I talked them out of it, and I was like, I thought, hell no.

352
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,520
So what we're going to do, and actually next week, Keith is making me copies of the Flashrom,

353
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,060
the game CD and the install CD and I'm going to hack a Max 2 machine and we're going to

354
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,000
make my own custom mix in the arcade.

355
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That would be good.

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Now, how pompous and cocky of you would it be saying that you're going to be able to

357
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
accomplish this?

358
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,000
Do you really think you're going to be able to get in there and hack all the data?

359
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,340
Why hasn't it been done yet?

360
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,360
If it's possible to do, why hasn't somebody else done it yet?

361
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
Why haven't the Japs done it?

362
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
The Japs always do it first.

363
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,940
Well, for one over here in America, all these machines are illegal.

364
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,540
So really, there's nothing they can do about the fact that I hacked a fucking machine.

365
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,140
Well, they can say, oh, this music's not supposed to be on here.

366
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,740
Well, because it's not licensed.

367
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,980
Well, neither is any of the music that's on any of the import machines, so there's nothing

368
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
really they can do.

369
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Suck my dick!

370
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Exactly.

371
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,220
So there's nothing that they can really do on as far as that.

372
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Now, hacking a machine is slightly complicated, but it can be done.

373
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,540
Now, there's a song you should put on there, Why You Gotta Go and Make Things So Comfy.

374
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
No.

375
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
Anyways.

376
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
But it can be done.

377
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I mean, look right here.

378
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:48,540
images and music is a piece of cake to do. And the actual game data itself, the actual program, is only like 30 MB. It's all on a flash ROM, a flash card actually, just a normal 32 MB flash card. And it's pretty easy. Plus, he's also having a few friends of his who are crackers and that kind of stuff. Now that I'm not talking about white guys, I'm talking about actually people that crack software.

379
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:55,420
software. They're going to be doing the same thing. So, no looking at it. I really think

380
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,740
it shouldn't be too hard since my knowledge of making edits and that kind of stuff and

381
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,580
actually working with just reverse engineering all this shit to do it. Sure, it will take

382
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,060
time. I need to actually look at the game CD and stuff to figure out how all the stuff

383
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,180
is stored and that kind of junk, but I think we can do it.

384
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,500
So this is your new project?

385
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
This is my new project.

386
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Your new time waster?

387
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,100
time waster yes and but at the same time other cool stuff I'll be able to do with

388
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,900
these game CDs that he's given me is rip all the videos for Max 2. Everyone's

389
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,940
been trying to do that ripping the videos off of DDR USA but I'm actually

390
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,380
just gonna rip them off of Max 2. What I'm planning to do is actually reskin

391
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,140
the whole thing just tire redo the whole skin for it so it's gonna look

392
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,540
professional not gonna be this oh look DDR top hits with like a little gradient

393
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,740
background piece of shit that they have on there. And a picture of Britney! And a

394
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,020
a picture of Brittany? No, I'm not going to do that. Reskin the whole backer, everything,

395
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,460
you know, do skins on it, make it all real nice, redo everything. Those steps are going

396
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,020
to be brand new and we were just throwing around a bunch of ideas because actually,

397
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,100
for instance, people would think, okay, there's limitations on what you can put on one of

398
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,340
those things that's all stored on CD. Well, not exactly because you can replace the CD

399
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,220
ROM drives with hard drives and then you can just stick, oh, look, 120 gigs worth of stuff

400
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,660
on there, you can actually have a DDR mix with everything on it. So it can be done.

401
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,820
Loki makes Konami cry. Oh, yeah. Well, see, Konami would be the only one to get pissed

402
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,500
about this stuff, or the RIA, but then all they'd have to do is they'd have to remove

403
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,120
every machine in the United States, which... So you could possibly be fucking it up for

404
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,540
everybody? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hello. I'm fucking it up for everybody. I'm not selling

405
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:40,140
my fucking mix on the internet for, no, 11, 14... $1,495. Yeah, I'm not selling. This

406
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,260
this is going to be exclusive to scandia okay this is exclusive to scandia

407
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,300
so there's only one so if you're out there listening to me you know exactly

408
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,620
where to come and arrest loki

409
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,260
okay just because i make the thing doesn't mean i'm responsible for it

410
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,100
that's like trying to sue the gun manufacturer for a murder i mean

411
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,820
just because they make it

412
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,700
doesn't mean i'm assuming the risk for actually running it in an actual arcade

413
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,580
this is all scandia so

414
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,520
things go down

415
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,120
they're going down not me

416
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,120
going to ruin DDR, or Loki's going to ruin DDR.

417
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Yeah, but guess what? Another thing is, um, I will be able to get copies of

418
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,120
all these game scenes and stuff. I have, you know, Ox...

419
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I have the hookups, basically, and so right when we get Extreme 2,

420
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,120
same thing with that. So, what I need to figure out now, the really tough thing...

421
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,120
What the hell do I put in it? You should copy your sim over.

422
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,120
That's a lot of shit, no? Screw that.

423
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I will advise you on what songs need to be in there.

424
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Well, but the first step you gotta figure out, you gotta be able to replace, like, at first you gotta go and, like, you start little baby steps. Okay, I'm gonna replace one song. I'm gonna see if I can replace one song.

425
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
We need DDR2DX style.

426
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,120
That'd be cool. You need to go, and then, and then he'll go and start ripping the 2DX discs. That'll be his next project.

427
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Well, I mean, it sounds like a major undertaking, but I think if I can pull it off, other than the fact that it'd be, like, really cool because we'd be the only arcade in the United States that have, like, custom mix.

428
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:46,120
Ah, decent question from the chat room. If you can hack an arcade version, why haven't you hacked a PlayStation version yet? Or a Dreamcast version?

429
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Because I haven't even tried.

430
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Oh. That's alright.

431
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I mean, I mean, well, here's the thing.

432
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
People have hacked the Dreamcast version, by the way.

433
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:13,120
The arcade versions are like I said, they are very different. There's a lot of things you can change on an arcade version and you can't there.

434
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,520
going to be a little different too. Sure, I guess we could try hacking a Playstation

435
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,120
version, but I'd rather do the arcade.

436
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,820
The Dreamcast ones will be easier to do though because it's more compatible with the Windows

437
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
environment.

438
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Yeah, it's Windows CE.

439
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,800
No, they're not running Windows CE, but they're more compatible. The thing about Dreamcast

440
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,420
games is that they're not running in Windows CE unless they boot up Windows CE at the beginning

441
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,740
of the game, because it's actually loading Windows onto the Dreamcast every time you

442
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
boot the game.

443
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,440
Yeah, but I don't know we're gonna look at it. I'll see you know how feasible it is

444
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm getting copies of fourth mix stuff and max too, so

445
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
We'll go from there

446
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,420
Sounds like fun all I ask you to put on it, please not so quick back in BDR. Don't worry

447
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,240
I was gonna bring back everything including telephone operator cuz I love that song they didn't bring it back so I

448
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Like it just cuz it's a lot like the original

449
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,200
We'll put a bunch of crazy shit in there. All the things that people wanted in there, I'll put in there.

450
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,200
The only problem is though, I'm going to piss a lot of people off with this mix.

451
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm not seeing why, but let me just put it this way, a lot of people will be angry at me at the very end of this mix.

452
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Are you okay? Jamie has a medical emergency?

453
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,820
But yeah, that's an idea. I mean, we'll see how hard it is and when I get done with it, you know

454
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
We'll see. I think I think it can be done

455
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't think it's gonna be too difficult if these idiots can make one

456
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,080
I mean obviously they didn't go into great detail of actually hacking the program and changing

457
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,540
some of it looks like the steps or anything, but

458
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
You know never know. It shouldn't be too difficult

459
00:33:50,280 --> 00:34:12,560
What do you guys think about this DDR top hits, your opinions, what makes you want to

460
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
throw up?

461
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,280
Personally, I want to play it just once, just to see how bad it is, or maybe they actually

462
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,320
did change the steps and it's somewhat decent.

463
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I'm just curious.

464
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,680
It's going to suck.

465
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Look at the fucking banner for just the beginning there.

466
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
It's like blue.

467
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,760
They probably don't have any artists.

468
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,400
They're probably a bunch of programming nerds.

469
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
They have no art people.

470
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,080
They just think they're stupid and don't know jack about they just threw this shit together.

471
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,280
You're thinking if you're going to sell something, at least make it look good, I mean, I don't

472
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
know.

473
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,240
I could do a way better job than that, that's all.

474
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,320
Black Lab's calling this DDR Miss Hits.

475
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
No, I'll name it something.

476
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,200
It's the Total Request Live version of DDR.

477
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I'm talking about Pop It 2.

478
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,560
Well, seriously, I mean, it's like, okay, what do you want to see in DDR?

479
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,200
Okay, well, you know, people, you know, obviously have said V before, oh, well, the steps for

480
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
V suck.

481
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
You should just call it DDR that doesn't suck.

482
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:15,600
No, I was going to call it maybe like, DDR Unauthorized or some shit like that, I don't

483
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
know.

484
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Red Band DDR!

485
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Porno DDR!

486
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
No, I guess you can't have that at...

487
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
DDR XXTREME!

488
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
DDR XXXTREME!

489
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,600
We'll even put Max the XXXM in there just for the hell of it.

490
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,840
Put like a song called that.

491
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,480
We could put crazy stuff in there.

492
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,480
This DDR sucks.

493
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I don't know. Well, we just have to see how feasible this is.

494
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,000
Can I be the new announcer? Can we hack the announcer voice, too? I want to be the announcer.

495
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,040
Actually, you can. We can hack the announcer voice. I was just thinking about using what's

496
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,720
in there right now. Obviously, we can probably steal the stuff from a solo or whatever.

497
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,040
Warning! This game causes cancer!

498
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,240
We need the squirrel that goes, Whee!

499
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,440
you know what we maybe need to get Jamie to like do the voices because you know

500
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,000

507
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,560

508
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,040

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:56,720

513
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,800

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,720

517
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,360
off charging $1,500 for this each they don't I don't know unless they're

518
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,920
selling full machines, no upgrade is worth that.

519
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,440
We didn't talk about some of the fabulous songs that you can play in DDR Top Hits.

520
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,120
Let's name some of these gems, shall we?

521
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,080
Featuring top US artist Britney Spears with Boyz and Crazy.

522
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, Boyz.

523
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,440
I haven't heard Boyz, but, you know, Crazy, maybe, but those aren't exactly, you know,

524
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,640
let's see, whoops, she did it again, or what was the other one that she did?

525
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Who cares?

526
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,080
Boyz was a song that she played in Goldmember.

527
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
Beyonce Knowles, Work It Out.

528
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,200
Isn't that a rather new song?

529
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,960
I thought that song just came out a little while ago, so they've been working on this

530
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
right up till right now.

531
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,200
How you let me know, Out of My Head and Fia.

532
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,840
Eminem Without Me, Pink Most Girls, Ricky Martin, Cup O' Life, La Vida Loca, She Bangs.

533
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Now see, the people who worked on this obviously have a Ricky Martin fetish, because there's

534
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,320
more Ricky Martin than anything else in here.

535
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,080
You know, most of the songs on there I've never heard.

536
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Ricky Ma-an.

537
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,560
Cup O' Life sucks, Livin' La Vida Loca's crap, and She Bangs is shit.

538
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,520
Although, don't you want to say that you danced to She Bangs?

539
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Actually, Couple Life and Lavita Loka I have her because I have Samba de Amigo.

540
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Imagine the video for She Bangs.

541
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
We'll get the fucking-

542
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Wait, are you gonna make new movies for the Loki mix or whatever?

543
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Actually, I was thinking of putting 2DX videos for some of them in there.

544
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,520
But yeah, we could put random videos, we could have the ferret in there, I don't know.

545
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,280
the fuck we wanted. This is pretty much what we wanted to do. I'm actually surprised that

546
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,840
they're going to go and actually do something. We'll just rob like Captain Jack. Go! Let's

547
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,160
go! Let's go! Let's go! I'm just surprised that they're actually willing to do something

548
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,920
like this. I mean, that's kind of ballsy, I would think, just to say, you know what?

549
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,600
We're just going to put some heck fucking arcade game in our arcade. I don't know if

550
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,960
jason nino saw that

551
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,240
someone your hack makes jason ninos cry

552
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,000
all i gotta say though is if they're gonna fucking punish me just give me a

553
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,760
fucking job at konami seriously

554
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,800
i mean oh is this what the point is minded to say

555
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
either you're gonna hire me or i'm gonna fuck you up

556
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,840
this is what this is what it's gonna say is

557
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,400
well if you're gonna take so long to make a fucking you know ddr mix and you

558
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,520
say i'm gonna do it for you and then i'm gonna say hi you suck because my mix

559
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,920
owns all of you and you just suck ass. Oh, look at this. My mix is more popular than

560
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,460
the extreme machine in Scandia. Oh, you suck. That's what's going to end up happening. This

561
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,960
is what people are going, oh, extreme sucks ass. I'm going over here and playing a thousand

562
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,840
songs. Oh, wait. Oh, oh, oh, look. You know, this ace sucks ass on the machine over here.

563
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,300
Let's play the big money ruler, Seth. You have fun.

564
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,080
How about Mr. Spanky Mix? Mr. Spanky. You know, I was thinking, well, if we got DDR

565
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,680
I don't know how hard it would be to convert the characters over from DDRPC, but we could

566
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,480
put Mr. Spanky in training mode, maybe.

567
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Alright.

568
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,360
We'll put a video in the background with him whipping Betty or some, or no, Betty whipping

569
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,800
him because he looks like a bitch.

570
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Nellie with Hotten here.

571
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,680
Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams, Shakira, and many

572
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
more.

573
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,840
Mariah Carey, crap right there.

574
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm sure it'll be as wonderful as Glitter.

575
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,480
It'll be as wonderful as the DDR 5th Mix Solo also.

576
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,520
All right.

577
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, yes, the DDR 5th Mix Solo.

578
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,080
What the hell was that all about?

579
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,320
Did anybody ever purchase that to see if it worked or anything?

580
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,320
No, but it's probably the same thing.

581
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,560
Laser Force should die.

582
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,000
All right.

583
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,560
Let's see.

584
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:11,680
They didn't they didn't hack all the songs in this though. They got butterfly. They left him butterfly for whatever reason because butterfly is puppy fun

585
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
I guess

586
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,840
All right

587
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,000
We're gonna take a real quick break as promised

588
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,200
I'm gonna play that song that I did my very first step file for because

589
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
Yeah

590
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,200
I'm a co-host on this show and I can do things like that when I want and

591
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,000
Then we'll hear some other stuff and we're gonna come back and talk about more fun things

592
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,420
Oh, we have a new game to play tonight. Maybe we'll do that after the break. I don't know. We'll see

593
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,940
We'll see if you guys have been good or not. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We will be

594
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,180
We'll be right back, everybody.

595
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:26,700
Well, your child may find what's in it, but half of he used to smile again, and once

596
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,060
he leaves the night, he'll turn and turn around, and he'll begin to change, he didn't

597
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,820
I've got energy, didn't think it's strange

598
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,580
But then it got a call

599
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,300
It helped me leap on my feet

600
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,820
It couldn't stay too much

601
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,020
I had a dream

602
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,420
You're like me, don't be too happy

603
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,180
If you get up, it's not to be out of touch

604
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Give it up, give it up, give it up

605
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:32,180
I got the beat and I ride it I got the beat and I ride it

606
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Rock the party, rock the party, rock the party Higher than higher

607
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:48,180
I'm burning like a fire Higher and higher

608
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm breaking higher

609
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Stop screaming and try to look hard I get my body up, you get that beat hard

610
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been

611
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
In the game two more, six days, I think I've been

612
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
Way back when, I've been putting it down

613
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Asking how long it was the baddest bitch on this side of town

614
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
I float like a butterfly, sing like a real

615
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
Spectacular woman in my city

616
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,180
I don't propose for never giving it less than the best

617
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Lots of ears in the game, that's your request

618
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,180
You like to rhyme, I can't be there

619
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I can't compete, so I don't care

620
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Why that's me, leave it to me

621
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,180
What a real MC is supposed to be

622
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Fucking me up every time that I drop a fucking bullet baby

623
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,180
I done took the spot, I got the beat

624
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,180
And I rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

625
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,180
Higher and higher

626
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,180
I'm doing it like fire

627
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,180
Higher and higher

628
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,180
I'll take you higher

629
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,180
Stand up, stand up, start your fight, start shutting down

630
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,180
Get up, stand up, start your perception

631
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,180
Get up, stand up, start your perception

632
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Get up, stand up

633
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,180
How you gonna be the attraction

634
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,180
I want you, if you wanna stay to the wall

635
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,180
Ride yourself, a piece of reaction

636
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,180
You got to get out the level, make the big fail

637
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,180
Get out, you know we got to go

638
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,180
Get out the level, dance along down the road

639
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,180
Here we go, here we go

640
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,180
Stand up, stretch up, focus up, show up Get up, stand up

641
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:44,180
What's with you and there in a corner? Like a window, sitting by yourself in the dark

642
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,180
You don't really wanna be your no-no

643
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,180
Come on now, get up and dance that ass in your pit

644
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,180
And please take a moment to get your feet

645
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,180
And raise your feet to the most there's no beat

646
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,180
That's, that's, that's, that's why, that's why

647
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,180
Get up, stand up, stretch up, focus up, show up

648
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Every time I hear your voice

649
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:06,180
Baby, every day and every night

650
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction

651
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,180
And now here's something we hope you'll really like

652
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week

653
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,180
Hello everybody, this is Mr. Spanky

654
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:29,580
hope you're enjoying getting to play me in the newest version of DDR PC and now

655
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:35,700
I'd like to present to everybody out there mr. Spanky tip of the week today

656
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:41,020
we're gonna talk about planning a masturbation party because everybody

657
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:46,460
knows that mr. Spanky likes to attend masturbation parties with his friend

658
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:53,380
Betty. Mr. Spanky would like to remind you that when you're planning a

659
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,820
master basin party, do not forget the latex. You should get several boxes of

660
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:04,420
latex gloves, as well as a wide variety of condoms, both lubricated and

661
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:10,980
unlubricated. Also, pick up some dental dams. Even if people keep to themselves,

662
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:17,900
themselves, the latex can add a new dimension to the fun. If the masturbation gets interactive,

663
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:24,580
the latex is absolutely necessary to keep things safe. Are you enjoying my masturbation

664
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:29,580
pimp, Dark Sakura?

665
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:35,700
Are you enjoying my masturbation pimp, Loki?

666
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,980
I was just checking thank you, I've been a naughty boy this week.

667
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:46,900
I'd also like to remind you to lube it up, get plenty of water-based lubricants.

668
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,820
You may want to opt for single-use packets rather than big bottles.

669
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,980
It will cost a little more, but it's a lot neater and cleaner, and guests will be happy

670
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,500
to have their own lube supplies.

671
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,300
I'd also like to remind you to cover your furniture and even the floor with sinks, so

672
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,820
that will make people more comfortable and help keep things tidy.

673
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:17,140
You like to keep things neat when you masturbate, don't you?

674
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:26,900
Lastly, Mr. Spanky would like to urge you to clean up, because nobody likes a messy

675
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:36,520
masturbation thing. And we all know that a masturbation party can be quite a mess, especially

676
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:46,320
if you're masturbating to DVR in the nude. That's really messy. Remember folks, don't

677
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:53,920
let DVR be your bitch. Remember to use baby wipes, tissues, and paper towels, and they

678
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
They should be provided in abundance.

679
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,920
You need to use these things to clean Mr. Spanky's bank.

680
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Things are bound to get messy,

681
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,920
but having the necessities immediately at hand

682
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,920
can decrease the carnage considerably.

683
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,920
You should also set up several trash cans around the play area.

684
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Line them up with plastic bags for easy and safe disposal.

685
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Remember to take inventory or in sex ways, in case something gets lodged somewhere and you lose them.

686
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:33,920
Excuse me. Excuse me. Is your name Mr. Spanky? No, I'm Mr. Spanky and these are my tips.

687
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Oh, someone's a little pissed off. Did someone get hamster stuck up their sphincter and just kind of forget about it?

688
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Were you at that party? I didn't see you at that party. Oh, you were one of the masked people, weren't you? Oh, I understand.

689
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
Is your name Valencia?

690
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,920
That does it for Mr. Spanky's tips of the week.

691
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Please enjoy me in the new DDR character pack number 9 for DDR PC.

692
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,920
And now, I'm taking you back to that crappy radio show.

693
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:22,240
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

694
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,640
Well, this time they'll take a man, they'll watch him back

695
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,040
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all

696
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,840
Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, what am I gonna do?

697
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom

698
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,540
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

699
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,540
We don't here

700
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:57,540
Here to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

701
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,540
It's really funny.

702
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,540
They should put the catch-up song in DDR, please look, please, please, please.

703
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,540
Actually, that was one of the songs planned to be in there.

704
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,540
Alright, cool.

705
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,540
Anyway.

706
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,200
It's going to be a long, long, long time before we ever see anything, though, right?

707
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,760
I plan on saying, yeah, at least, at least six months.

708
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
At least.

709
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,760
At least.

710
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
All right.

711
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
Well, we'll be looking forward to that.

712
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
We'll see updates as they go.

713
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,920
Anywho, it's funny, the catch-up song, there's another funny story I have about that.

714
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,200
Last night I was out at the club, and the DJ put that on as the very last song and says,

715
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,840
I really hate this song, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

716
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,040
And then nobody knew the catch-up dance though.

717
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,640
I wish Dave had been there so he could have done the catch-up dance, because he's the

718
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,040
only person I know that knows it.

719
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,400
I only know this.

720
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Anyway.

721
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,960
That's my catch-up story, thank you.

722
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,520
Chat room is reeling over Mr. Spanky's sex tips.

723
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,320
We had somebody set themselves on fire.

724
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,000
Alright.

725
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,560
So without further ado, I'm going to ask everybody in the chat room right now.

726
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,760
It is that time of the show.

727
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,760
I'm sorry.

728
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,760
It's happy time!

729
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:47,080
they don't count. Or you can send them to email. You can send them over email to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

730
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,080
And I have to ask Jamie now, do we want the terror mix of Slagwerk or do we want the original?

731
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,600
Let's go for the terror mix. We want the terror mix, so I need to find it. So we're gonna

732
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,600
have a new Fuck You song for Jamie. But it's always going to still be Slagwerk. It will

733
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:04,520
always be Slagwerk. I will never not use the Tac song. Yes, you'll get Jenny Rom JB, I

734
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Alright, here we go. It's time for the Fuck You's of the Week!

735
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
Okay, let's...

736
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Well, we have to go for it.

737
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,520
This is fucked up.

738
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
Okay.

739
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,520
The first Fuck You of the Week goes to Walgreens for not having chocolate cupcakes.

740
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,520
Everybody here knows that chocolate cupcakes are my crack food.

741
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,520
Well, they didn't have them. They had chocolate zingers, which I think are becoming my new crack food. Anyway!

742
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:41,520
So, I'm not as sufficiently wired as I could be, although I almost finished a ball of Propel, which fuck you to Mr. Spanky for making me nearly choke on my Propel, okay?

743
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Um, let's see, I...

744
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,520
Yeah, I think, I think he likes to choke. Yeah, Mr. Spanky, from what I hear, enjoys choking.

745
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:58,520
Um, another fuck you goes toward, um, the shitty week I had, because I just felt shitty and PMS-y, and that sucked.

746
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,520
That, actually, you know, that was bad.

747
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,520
Um, my other fuck you is a very, very serious fuck you, um, it goes toward drama queens.

748
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:17,520
Not all drama queens are bad lying to you, but then there's the people who complain about their life and then don't do shit to change it.

749
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,520
If you hate your life, do something about it! If you want change to happen, go make it fucking happen!

750
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:30,520
You know, it may not be instant, but you don't have a right to bitch unless you start doing something about it, okay?

751
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
That's what I want to say about that.

752
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
And on a happier note, um...

753
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Do you need to be happy bunny plushies and fuck them for not making me?

754
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
I did see a happy bunny doll once.

755
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,520
Somewhere. I don't remember. It was on a hot topic, I think.

756
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Oh, I'm a happy bunny plushie.

757
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Oh, we'll find you one for Christmas.

758
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Alright.

759
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,520
One more thing, Johnny the homicidal maniac is cool.

760
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,520
I'm not getting many fuck yous of the week in the chat room, this is kind of surprising.

761
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,520
I've seen one pop up so far, usually there's like 20.

762
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Just another reminder, send them all on your way.

763
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,520
Unless you're sending them over email, that's fine too.

764
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,520
OrangeLoungeRadio at yahoo.com

765
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,520
They need happy noodle boy flushes.

766
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,520
Moving along, Loki, your fuck yous of the week please.

767
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Oh boy.

768
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Okay, let's begin with that hellhole that we call Sun Splash, or Arviggle for all those.

769
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,520
What did they do this time?

770
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,520
Okay, well I went there two days this week, that was probably mistake number one.

771
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,520
First day I go there, there's some dumbass behind the counter, I want, you know, soda.

772
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,520
You stand there, kind of, you know, dead to the world, so I see the bell, and I press the bell.

773
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,520
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I do that for about two minutes.

774
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,600
And it finally goes, oh, oh, oh, and just sees me there.

775
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,480
So then, I'm like, OK, can I get a large surge?

776
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,640
We don't have surge anymore, so fuck them for not having

777
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,720
surge, and fuck that stupid idiot.

778
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,640
Fuck them for hiring dumbass people.

779
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,120
Why the hell they have dumbass kids working

780
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,720
at this stupid place?

781
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,680
I swear.

782
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,640
And fuck them today for not fucking refilling the machine

783
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,240
fast enough with tickets because I keep kicking ass

784
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,240
at stupid speed demon.

785
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,200
So fuck them for that, and just fuck them for not keeping

786
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,200
the machines up because they suck ass. So I hate them, that's fine. Now the next thing

787
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:25,200
I have for you before is SQS, also known as Stupid Question Syndrome. These stupid people

788
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,960
out there, they ask you really dumb obvious questions. For instance, when I'm playing

789
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,960
the machine, I have a giant stash of tickets in there. Did you win those from that machine

790
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,960
there? Yeah. That's why they're coming out the machine. That's why there's a big pile

791
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:47,160
pilot dutch the machine on the floor. I won them for that machine. How did you do that?

792
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:52,880
Because I won them, you fucking idiot. Also for people to drive below the speed limit.

793
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,360
The speed limit's posted there, so you drive faster than it. It's a goal, you know, you

794
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,720
want to achieve better than the speed limit. But these people, they're just like, oh, the

795
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,500
speed limit. They stay away from it like it's like a fucking leper or something like that,

796
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,880
you know? Just stay away from that piece of shit, and they drive 20 under the speed limit.

797
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,940
like trying to swerve around them and shit. I hate them. I hate slow people. I hate slow

798
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:22,520
people mentally. I hate slow people in automobiles. May they all die. Fucking A. I swear they

799
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:29,420
should give me, you know, fucking license to kill. I would save the world. Just eliminate

800
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:36,420
the fucking weakness of our damn society. Kill the stupid people! Kill them all!

801
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,420
Yeah, but without stupid people it would give us smart people any kind of meaning.

802
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,420
There has to be a balance.

803
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,420
We'll just lock them up in little pens.

804
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:50,420
Yeah, but right now it's like 9 to 10 or 9 to 1 or something like that, you know?

805
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,420
You have 9 stupid people and you have 1 smart person.

806
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,420
9 stupid people, 1 smart person.

807
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,420
I'd say we just like drop it down to 3 to 1.

808
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,420
I know something like that.

809
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,420
Yeah, so they all suck. I hate them.

810
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,420
Stupid people are meant to be peons of the smart.

811
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,420
We order them around, they fight our worst for us.

812
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,420
Yeah, but then they're stupid, they get in our way, and they annoy me, and they ask me stupid questions, and just...

813
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,420
I hate them. I hate them all.

814
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,420
They should die.

815
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,420
Fucking die!

816
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,420
You want all their balls to die.

817
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,420
Yes.

818
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,420
Um, that's, yeah, that's pretty much it.

819
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,420
F you two fortune cookies and tell me to kill my relatives.

820
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,420
Because, uh, I don't like that. That's not cool.

821
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,020
and uh... yet what you think that it's not

822
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,480
fortunes are these

823
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,820
you'll hear a larger

824
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,240
large sum of money from your relatives

825
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,320
okay

826
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,560
who have to die for me

827
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,720
that's what told me it

828
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,840
communicate to me

829
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,640
killed relatives until you find one of our money

830
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,820
so i guess i've got to do you know

831
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,720
i got one today is like being

832
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,480
that wisdom does

833
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,200
wisdom is rare

834
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,200
I forget what the fucking thing said, but it basically called me uglier stupid, so the fuck that stupid fortune cookie.

835
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Listen as rare as Asian beauty.

836
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,200
See, it said I'm stupid! It said I'm stupid! May they die!

837
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
Anyways, that's it.

838
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,200
It didn't say you're stupid, it said you didn't have any common sense.

839
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
SEND THEM STUPID! STUPID!

840
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
I think Rob's next.

841
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,400
Yes, I'm next although I don't remember like

842
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,360
All of my FUs of the week, but I remember my first one my first FU of the week

843
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,800
I hope you're listening. My first FU of the week goes to Brad

844
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,160
You jerk

845
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,660
Yesterday we went to Scandia and we started playing Oni mode and keep in mind

846
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:48,680
I haven't played DDR in about three weeks by the way, and I'm like, oh, I'll play Oni mode with Brad and I said Brad

847
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:55,360
I'm willing to do any oni in the game except love revenge because I always fail Japan like in five seconds because I can't ever

848
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,640
Get those gallops. Shut up. Stop laughing at me. Fuck you

849
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,960
So, of course, what does Brad decide to pick he picks the oni now key featuring Polteri

850
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
I'm going to double this

851
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,960
I had to listen to this.

852
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,400
So fuck Brad!

853
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,040
I hate you, I'm just kidding.

854
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,200
I love you Brad!

855
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,240
But not too much, Irene's watching.

856
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,600
I'd also like to say F you to being tired, because I was really tired at the

857
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,640
club last night, and that's just not cool to go to a club and feel like you're

858
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,840
dancing like a zombie. Unless you're at a golf club, then you know, that's what you're supposed to be doing.

859
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,320
I'd like to say F you to not doing a damn thing this week, really, I just kind of

860
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:42,320

861
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,200
i would have been at four thirty in the morning i woke up at four four

862
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,080

863
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,840
so if you sleep twelve hours because we're waiting for the meeting

864
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,400

865
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,520
that's true you get my song and i will process

866
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,160
if you were up to be here

867
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
when i got here and wait half an hour

868
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,080
oh yes uh... f you to me sleeping in so long that it took me awhile to get jamie

869
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,280
and look he had to wait out here in the cold in front of my house for half hour

870
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,960
but i thought i'd have to look at you see probably a barbecue stick up my

871
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,080
whole house at all

872
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,120
i thought it's not

873
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,600
i didn't have to do

874
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,320
all right

875
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,800
let's go around the room and

876
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,640
listen to some other fuck you's of the week

877
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:33,640
JB do you have any fuck you's of the week

01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,000
who've got all the time

885
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,880
you like to see

886
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,640
was stopped by the road

887
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,460
there's some of the other road

888
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,460
I must look, and stare, and slow down, and slow everyone else down!

889
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:38,460
At least it usually clears up in the miles.

890
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,460
Alright, that's it?

891
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,460
Pretty much.

892
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,460
Alright, cool.

893
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,460
Oh, yes.

894
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,460
Bogey!

895
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,460
Real quick one.

896
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,460
F used his stupid kid at Sun Splash today that keeps trying to talk to me.

897
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
I don't want to talk to him, so I ignore him.

898
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,460
I walk around.

899
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,460
I don't talk to him.

900
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,460
I don't make eye contact with him.

901
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,460
I wish he would just die.

902
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
And stop talking to me!

903
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:58,980
trying to talk to me

904
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,980
if you'd like to be carol saying you gotta be a little louder

905
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:07,980

906
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,340

01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,820
Good God, Twen, you've got too many FUs. I'm reading some of these.

910
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:34,820
A lot of FUs to Justin for being Jenny Rom's bitch and not his and not sending him Jenny Rom songs.

911
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,820
FU to people at the arcade literally hanging on the PVP machine. FU to still having dial-up.

912
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,820
FU to Jenny Rom songs being hard to find.

913
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,820
FU to Mr. Spanky, finally someone with his opinions.

914
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,820
And FU to no one using the new V host he set up for the chat room.

915
01:06:50,820 --> 01:07:00,820
FU to... oh no, that's not an FU. That's a happy FU. I don't read happy things on this show, so FU twin.

916
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:08,820
Skyline says FU to germs for making him sick. That does suck. I hate being sick. I was sick a couple weeks ago.

917
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Oh, Black Lab has a few FUs. I better restart the song. This is going to be long.

918
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,820
Fuck that Mr. Spanky thing. I've been internally soiled. I hate you.

919
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,820
Mr. Spanky says you're welcome.

920
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:26,820
Fuck the UCD library for only having one copy of every book, so some of the books I needed weren't in stock.

921
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:34,820
Fuck the drama that my suitemates are getting into with other people, and fuck the MGL- oh, that's not very nice.

922
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:43,820
Well, okay, he says fuck himself because he has two finals and can't go to the MGL tournament on Friday the 13th, I guess.

923
01:07:43,820 --> 01:08:06,820
darktentorias says, F you for still having the same Vanessa May song for the longest time now.

924
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,740
now we need to work on their never getting rid of death will never get rid

925
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,180
of destiny but we might have something else that you know i know we won't

926
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,420

927
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,400
i want to have a chill in there but i think it's a little too fast

928
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,860

all right

933
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,660
Oh, you have another one, Jamie, yes.

934
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:38,940
I'd like you to my Para Para controller for not working, thank you.

935
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:42,900
vidpower says, F you to viruses, I had a cold all week and I started running a

936
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,980
small fever.

937

I also have a sore throat from it, also F you to the sun

938
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:51,540
for having glare on the Beatmania 2DX machine and making the screen even harder

939
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,500
to see.

940
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:58,140
At least you have a Beatmania 2DX machine in town, F you.

941
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,780
slinky says f u to the metreon pads for sticking

942
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:08,580

01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,460
actually they have max twos upstairs now

946
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,740
who cares

947
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,680
just wanted to point that out

948
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,420
uh...

949
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,060
Let's see. Oh, he went to the auto show today.

950
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,940
Oh, look, he says that's OK.

951
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:38,580
Brack 2000 says, F you to lost ketchup for existing.

952
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,340
Yes. If you don't know, they're the ladies that sing the ketchup song.

953
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,820
Basically stole that song from the Sugarhill Gang, by the way.

954
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,460
That's just it's a sample of rapper's delight.

955
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,940
F you to the closest DDR machine being 40 miles away.

956
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,940
Crap, that does suck. I'm sorry.

957
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,940
I have had a cry for you just now.

958
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:06,940
I drove out to Roseville, Bethlehem, 40 miles every week to play DDR, so screw you, I don't care.

959
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,940
But if you wanted to, you could go to Tapioca Express.

960
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,940
Not when I first came out here.

961
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,940
That's right.

962
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
That's the USA day.

963
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,940
I first started playing this.

964
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:27,940
23rd Magus says, F you to Afrinova Primeval, which he passed with 1 10th of a bar left. Also F you to Nori Nori Nori for obvious reasons. Oh, that happens to be the song I'm playing right now.

965
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:44,940
It was me and Wanda the first time I passed it, and uh, their name here. I had like half my uh, actually I had, you know how on Fismics they have the little tiny bars that equal the whole bar? I had half of one of those left.

966
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,940
We love the fire, we love the fire

967
01:11:44,940 --> 01:12:12,220

969
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:18,540

it's called

974
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,940
or else

975
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,700
pop-up

976
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,220

you get to look at our crap everyday

979
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:41,140
and it's interesting

980
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,140
Alright.

981
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,860
F you to Yahoo for sending me spam.

982
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,200
We have spam in our mailbox right now and it looks like I wrote a note to myself in

983
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,620
there too which I already took care of so I can delete those.

984
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,680
So let's open up this email from Dave who isn't here tonight and he sent us an email

985
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,100
saying I'm not there.

986
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:02,020
He says read this word for word, we'll see.

987
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,640
Well sorry I couldn't be there this week so a big F you to both my parents for taking

988
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,500
me to Big Sur which blows ass.

989
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,500
What is Big Sur?

990
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Waterbed floor.

991
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Okay.

992
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,500
It's on the coast? What do they do there?

993
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,500
I don't know. I think that's where they have, like, surfing companies.

994
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Okay.

995
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,500
Oh, a surf's up, dude!

996
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,500
No, when I lived in Alabama, there's a waterbed store called Big Sur Waterbeds.

997
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Wait, Loki, in the mic.

998
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Big Sur's a fucking campground. It's in, like, the coast.

999
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,500
Alright, it's like a forest or some shit like that.

1000
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
We need to take this show to the wilderness!

1001
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:41,500
I've never heard of that place. I always knew of it as being a waterbed store.

1002
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:48,500
I was going to drive down past there, but fuck you to the Sacramento Tract, so I had to go to the mountains, and that was cool.

1003
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,500
Because I had to do that before snow came to the mountains and stuff.

1004
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:58,500
Bradley, by the way, is the king of impromptu road trips. The king. I'm sorry, JB?

1005
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:04,500
The name of that one would be where they have a place like, lower or something, where they camp out.

1006
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Orange Lounge and Blair Witch Project, thank you.

1007
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Fuck, fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck was that, fuck this, fuck that!

1008
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,500
That was basically the Blair Witch Project in ten seconds, thank you.

1009
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500

1013
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,180

01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,740

01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,500
And oh, if you want to join our IRC chat, just go to any other site, IRC server, and

1020
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,220
it's channel pound orange lounge, or it's on most of the same servers as the other big

1021
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,220
Bobani chat rooms.

1022
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:02,220
How cute.

1023
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,500
I was there last night, and the only person there was Black Lab, so...

1024
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,540
Oh, well, you were there for a second.

1025
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,540
You were idling.

1026
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,540
I was asleep.

1027
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,740
I was downloading stuff.

1028
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:17,740
And also, FYI, you can get to the chat room directly through our website.

1029
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,740
We have a Java chat.

1030
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:22,540
you that just don't have the time to set up M.I.R.C. or don't want to or you're on a work

1031
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,140
computer. I don't know why the hell you'd be at work on a Sunday night, but it is Monday

1032
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,140
morning in some countries. You know we don't have Java on my work computer?

1033
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:36,140
I can't run it. Anyway, you can do that directly through our website. Orangelounge.skiu.cx.

1034
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:44,700
F you to Jamie for eating my taquitos a while ago. Dude, you left in here, butthole. Okay,

1035
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,340
It's about it, maybe more later.

1036
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,980
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was our FUs of the week.

1037
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,100
Oh wait, I got one more! I got one more, I'm sorry.

1038
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,060
I have to find a special song for this FU too, I'm sorry.

1039
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:02,260
Just give me one minute here.

1040
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,340
Okay.

1041
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:07,740
Here we go.

1042
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:13,260
Sorry, I will take a break right after this FU.

1043
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,540

1044
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,620
Thank you.

1045
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:23,420
I don't know if you can hear, but we're playing Wesley Willis for you in the background.

1046
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,660
All right,

1047
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:28,980
because Jamie has to pee, we're going to take a quick break, and we will be right back.

1048
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,500
And when we come back,

1049
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,980
the Bamani Cage Match, a brand new game

1050
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,380
we're going to play here

1051
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,340
on the show. Your votes will determine

1052
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,660

1053
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,660

Orange Lounge Radio with the Bing Pong Ball!

1121
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,980
I need some good cage match music. What's a good cage match song?

1122
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:53,980
Something 2DX-ish. I'm thinking something kind of...

1123
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,980
QQQ

1124
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:58,980
Ooh, I don't know if I have We Will Rock You. I might.

1125
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:02,980
I think I have one of the other Queen covers in another directory.

1126
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,980
How about, like, uh...

1127
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,980
Radical Aid?

1128
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,980
Okay, alright, that'll work.

1129
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,980
Oh, Slag works for another segment, don't you think?

1130
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,980
And then Electrotuned.

1131
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:19,460
Do you have Electrotune?

1132
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:25,800
I have everything, I just have everything.

1133
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,800
I think?

1134
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,440
You could play Tengoku no Kiss.

1135
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,440
How about Holic?

1136
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,440
It's a good song.

1137
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,440
How about Holic?

1138
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,440
Holic will work.

1139
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,440
What?

1140
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,440
What?

1141
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,440
What?

1142
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,440
What, JB, what?

1143
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:39,440
Get out!

1144
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,520
You are banned from the show!

1145
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:50,720
just admitted that he does not like Jake that does not like tag oh he likes QQQ

1146
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,640
all right I think Clifford that absolutely the Clifford ball at him the

1147
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:59,920
Clifford ball of justice has been tossed to JB without further ado the bamani cage

1148
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,760
match now since the first time we've done the bamani cage match what this is

1149
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,760
gonna be all about is we're gonna play you two songs and they aren't from any

1150
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,960
the money can't play that out front they're not running for money but they

1151
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,320
have something to do with

1152
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,520
either a bamani artist

1153
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,180
a bamani uh... some kind of money relations like uh... another cover of a

1154
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:25,320
bamani solid another dance maniacs

1155
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,440
dance track

1156
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:29,280
or it's just kind of video game related

1157
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,360
because tonight we have one song that's five an artist that somewhat related to

1158
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,840
ddr and we have a song this video game related so what we do is we take two

1159
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,880
songs, put them together, and you guys will vote which one's good and which one is not

1160
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:47,760
so good. And whichever one is voted in will be added to the playlist for the future. So

1161
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,960
the Monty Michigan More Program all week long it will be in the playlist, and maybe for

1162
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,760
a little, maybe we'll actually keep it in for a month, I don't know.

1163
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:00,760
Yeah, the winner wins. Yes. The winner is then challenged next week by a new song, and

1164
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,760
if the new song beats the winner out, then it plays for the week, otherwise the winner

1165
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,760
The winner will stay on and play for the next week.

1166
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,760
It's really different all the way through.

1167
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,760
Well, what do you guys think?

1168
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,760
I don't know.

1169
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,760
Full song?

1170
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,760
Okay, we'll do this.

1171
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,760
We'll do this.

1172
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,760
We'll, um, well, okay, we'll just, we'll do the whole thing.

1173
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,760
So, what we're going to do, though, is we're not going to go into that right just yet.

1174
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,760
We'll go to another topic on the program and kind of do that as our next break.

1175
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,760
You want to do it now?

1176
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,760
All right, we'll do it now.

1177
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,760
Okay, so the two songs we're going to match up tonight in the Big Milani Cage match.

1178
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,760
Oop, not Viv ribbon, my bad.

1179
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Maybe that'll be next week though.

1180
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:18,760
Okay, the two songs are the Zippers with All Around the World, the bubble mix.

1181
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,760
And for those that don't know who the Zippers are, well, JB, you're the expert.

1182
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,760
Why don't you tell everybody who the Zippers are and what they've done in DDR.

1183
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:30,760
The Zippers were Jenny Rom versus Zippers and they did Wakka Wakka.

1184
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:35,760
And you can't really tell the difference between them, because they both sound exactly the same.

1185
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:43,000
Okay, and the second song that we're going to have playing is going to be, it's actually

1186
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,560
an overclock remix done by Final Fantasy, or FFMusicDJ.

1187
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:55,000
It's Final Fantasy VII String Machine, the Corel Prison Mix.

1188
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,320
Corel or Corel, whatever.

1189
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,920
So first we're going to play, and then you'll also get to get our opinion, since we have

1190
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,140
to participate in this somehow. We're not getting to vote in this. You're gonna get

1191
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:10,040
our big fat opinions on this. We're gonna be like the American Idol judges on these

1192
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:14,600
songs. So if they suck, we're gonna let you know. So we're putting on our judging faces

1193
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,040
right now. So, and then once we've given you our opinions on the songs, you'll be able

1194
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,200
to vote. Now here's the thing. Don't vote until they've both been played or your vote

1195
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,880
doesn't count. I'm not counting any votes that come in until the second song has finished

1196
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,200
completely. Yes, they're saying they can't hear you on the air, JB. You wanna scream

1197
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:38,380
something at the chair? Ah! Brilliant. All right, so here we go, starting off the Bemani

1198
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:45,380

01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:13,260
going on and on the same

1262
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,900
it's going to come to my brain

1263
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:16,780
loads

1264
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:20,580
over more hours a day

1265
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,900
when you've got the postal

1266
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:24,580
or back

1267
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:28,220
i agree my thoughts are was very happy happy happy happy it was kind of like

1268
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:31,700
nauseatingly happy at the beginning was bad but

1269
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:36,220
I could deal with it. It's not that bad. It's kind of, it's a nice, nice change of pace

1270
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:43,220
from, you know, meanness. Nice? In what dictionary? Are you going to notthedictionary.com? No,

1271
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:49,020
that's what makes me want to go out and kill people. And sing while I'm doing it. Alright,

1272
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:53,780
so... It makes me happy noodle boy happy. Alright, going around the room, quick, scale

1273
01:38:53,780 --> 01:39:00,780
of one to ten. What do you think? Uh... Logie? 1.5. 1.5. Bradley? Probably about four. Probably

1274
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:09,780
JB. Ten. I will give it a six. I'll give it a six. Alright. So that was Zippers all around the world.

1275

1277
01:43:44,780 --> 01:44:07,580
That was fucking cool.

1278
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,480

1281
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:22,900

1282
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:29,300
remix of Final Fantasy 7 string machine so let's talk about what we thought of

01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:33,260
the Final Fantasy string machine Jamie your thoughts we love it

1284
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:38,020
Loki of course love it it's one of the best Final Fantasy music remixes I've

1285
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:42,220
ever heard which song was I couldn't recognize what song it was I guess it's

1286
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:45,580
suppose it's yet for our present from

1287
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:48,580
and i i i think in record

1288
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:52,220
to me that i think you're a good thing

1289
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:53,580
uh... okay

1290
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:56,920
uh... i think that i think that that's what that's all they could be

1291
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,420
bradley about them

1292
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:00,380
critical

1293
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:02,500
all right you like it to be your thoughts

1294
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:05,180
axes that he had the accident figures

1295
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:08,620
but of course he's a he's a cheney rom horse of course you have to do it

1296
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,620
not happy enough for.

1297
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:13,300
If it had that and then went, we, we, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, we wouldn't have

1298
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,300
liked it.

1299
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,700
My thoughts on that song were that it's kind of, I like the trance type, I'm a horror for

1300
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,340
that trancey kind of music.

1301
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,580
Somebody in the chat room, let's go over, oh, let's go over, well, I'll talk for a second.

1302
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:24,580
Somebody in the chat room, though, said that it sounds like something from Fantasia, I

1303
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,580
really agree with that.

1304
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,580
It does sound like kind of a Fantasia track.

1305
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:31,740
I think that's very cool, although it's a little bit kind of repetitive for my taste,

1306
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,740
I don't know.

1307
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,740
I found it to be a little bit repetitive.

1308
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,660
So that's my only issue with it.

1309
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:38,580
So scale of one to ten, Jamie, what do you think?

1310
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,580
Nine.

1311
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,580
Nine.

1312
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,580
Loki.

1313
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:42,580
Ten.

1314
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:43,580
Ten.

1315
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:44,580
Bradley.

1316
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,580
Eight.

1317
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,580
JB.

1318
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,580
Four.

1319
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:48,580
I'm gonna give it a seven.

1320
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:53,100
So, it sounds like that song would win if we were the people voting, but we're not because

1321
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,580
this is everybody's show.

1322
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:55,580
It's not just our show.

1323
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:57,140
It's a chatroom show, an email show.

1324
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:03,500
So send in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email address, orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com.

1325
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:08,300
If you want the zippers to win or you want the Final Fantasy VII string machine to win.

1326
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,300
That's it. That's my Kate's match. We'll have the results for you after the next break.

1327
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:14,300
This is just a little message to vote for Final Fantasy.

1328
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,300
In the meantime...

1329
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,300
The ferret commands it.

1330
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,300
Let's talk about another big event that happened this week.

1331
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,300
The ferret likes JB better.

1332
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:23,300
The ferret likes JB better, what?

1333
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,300
I think the ferret likes JB better.

1334
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,300
Everybody can vote for zippers.

1335
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:30,300
The ferret wants everybody to vote for zippers, you said.

1336
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,300
Alright.

1337
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,300
Alright, we'll get to the results after the next break.

1338
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,300
That's it. That's it.

1339
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,500
I don't want to go back into musical. We've got so much to talk about here

1340
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:43,220
Big news this week big Bahmani holiday

1341
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:48,980
19 November and 20 November were both this week and we had some very big things happen Jamie

1342
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:54,460
Tell us about I feel you want to talk about 20 November in its honor on 2dx. Oh, yes

1343
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:57,380
I'd like to just I guess consider or just

1344
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:02,500
Basically say 1920 November would pretty much be the Bahmani New Year's

1345
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:07,300
years. That's pretty much what it is since 20 November was pretty much the start of the

1346
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,780
whole Bimani line with BeatMania, so I would consider it the New Year's.

1347
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,580
I don't know if I consider it New Year's, it's not a big party, it's just kind of like

1348
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:19,740
a day of remembrance. It's Bimani Veterans Day.

1349
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,460
It's just like Chinese New Year's, I mean no one celebrates that.

1350
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:27,120
Well the Chinese do I think. Oh yeah, like they count, okay.

1351
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,860
They're only like, you know, I think a quarter of the world's population.

1352
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:33,860
Who cares? That's pretty much what it is. It's an uncelebrated holiday.

1353
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:36,860
It's like Arbor Day.

1354
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:39,860
Okay, so it's the Bamani Arbor Day.

1355
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:42,860
Plant a Bamani machine.

1356
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:46,860
So what were some big events that happened in the community?

1357
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:48,860
I know you know of one. Jamie, you want to talk about this earlier?

1358
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:50,860
I got online and they were like...

1359
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:53,860
The show wasn't there, it was like robbed.

1360
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:55,860
Oh yeah, Orange Islands Radio did a celebration.

1361
01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:00,860
Very late on 19 November around 11.30 we kind of had a countdown until 20 November did some music.

1362
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,860
And we had video game guessing.

1363
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:07,860
Yes, and then 20 November was celebrated guessing old school 8-bit video game tunes.

1364
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,860
Which is why you should be listening to Orange Lawn's radio all the time.

1365
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:12,860
Yes, half your life like us.

1366
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:18,860
Sometimes you get to hear special live music programs. They happen occasionally. We call them the fuck-offs.

1367
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:19,860
The ferret commands it.

1368
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:23,860
The ferret commands that you listen to. The chat room demands it.

1369
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:29,340
I haven't said that yet tonight, so I needed to.

1370
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:33,220
A couple website re-enovations or relaunches this week, Jamie?

1371
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,220
Let's hear it for ddrspot.com.

1372
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,220
Weee!

1373
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,220
Hey, ddrspot.com.

1374
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:41,140
We've got a lot of buddies there, Mel B. I would call a frequent guest of this show at

1375
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:45,460
this point, Mel B. He's a big part of that team, so I know he's very proud of it.

1376
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:49,780
People who were really good with helping, those of us who were working with our tournament

1377
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:56,140
Shaft. Big shout out to Mike Noh and AJ for encoding the videos and putting them up on

1378
01:48:56,140 --> 01:49:00,900
DDR Spot. So hey, you can see what our Scandio looks like if you go there and download them.

1379
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:06,540
And the whole group of people with DDR Spot, they're really cool people. So you can also

1380
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,700
go get ringtones. I think they're all Nokia ringtones of all.

1381
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:14,300
I can't use the Nokia ringtones and that makes me cry. But we wanted to play your ringtone,

1382
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,300
didn't we?

1383
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,300
Well, my ringtone's not Beymani, but...

1384
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,940
Well, let's play your ringtone anyway, because we wanted to do this.

1385
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:23,700
So I'm going to call you right now, Jamie. No, I can just play it. Oh, you can just play it?

1386
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:28,500
Never mind. Don't give me any voicemail, dammit.

1387
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:35,500
My ringtone is cooler than everybody.

1388
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:45,240
I'm trying to see if anybody in the chat room is going to recognize it.

1389
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,680
I'll play it again.

1390
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,680
No, you will play it again, apparently.

1391
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:58,680
I will too.

1392
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,200
Vidpower says it's Chun-Li's stage.

1393
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,880
WRONG!

1394
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,160
Oh, 23rd Magus says that too.

1395
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,160
you know

1396
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:18,920
no not only my girl

1397
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:21,500
uh... for those in the chair of the couldn't guess it what do you think what

1398
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:22,420
is it jamie

1399
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:28,580
it's sacrosanct song sakura theme song right now i thought that sakras theme

1400
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:34,940
i hate to meet okay i hate to meet so close yet so far you almost had a heat

1401
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:36,380
hurt

1402
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:41,520
okay here's my ring tone it's not the money related at all

1403
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,360
wasn't playing

1404
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,360
Oh, because my vibrate's on. Whoops, my bad.

1405
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,360
Yeah, Rob's pocket vibrator.

1406
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,360
Yes, my cell phone doubles as a vibrator.

1407
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,360
Every call is a happy call.

1408
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,360
My cell phone doubles as a vibrator. It's quite exciting.

1409
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,360
Oh, that doesn't work.

1410
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,360
What happened?

1411
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,360
Those are my magical ringtones here.

1412
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,360
No, we can't guess what that is.

1413
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:14,440
That's AfroNova, right?

1414
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,920
No, it's a song called The Entertainer.

1415
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:23,160
And I'm sure since there's this trend in Bimani to redo a bunch of classical songs in a Bimani

1416
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:26,880
tune, I'm sure you'll see that tune up in a Bimani song one day.

1417
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,680
If you play that song again you just go...

1418
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,680
Whoa!

1419
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:30,680
Dude!

1420
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,980
It's a talker remix!

1421
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:36,160
Yeah, hey, you should put that in your sim.

1422
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:40,160
They need to do the bad synthy music and make it a pada-pada.

1423
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:45,160
Stop playing with a ferret, give me that!

1424
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:53,160
So yes, other 1920 November celebrations, in Japan I believe they released the code

1425
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:56,440
to unlock eight styles hidden stuff, so now you don't have to...

1426
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:57,440
We were thinking...

1427
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,440
I can play Sakura and fail with style.

1428
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:03,560
Yes, now you can play Sakura without having to AAA, you know, be for you on another heavy

1429
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,880
whatever.

1430
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:05,880
And then Xenon.

1431
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,880
two brand new songs also.

1432
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,880
But no tag.

1433
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,880
No more tag.

1434
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:12,880
Sorry, Jamie.

1435
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:13,880
Don't poke me back, ferret.

1436
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,880
You have to wait for Night Style.

1437
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,880
You think there's going to be a Night Style?

1438
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Yeah, I think so too.

1439
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,880
God yes.

1440
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,880
God yes.

1441
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,880
Give me the ferret.

1442
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:25,440
I'm not sure if this happened exactly on 19-20 November, but another website news, 2DX Style

1443
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:29,760
kind of got eaten up by BomaniStyle.com, right?

1444
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,280
Was that earlier or what happened with that?

1445
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,280
That's still last week.

1446
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,280
That was last week.

1447
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,280
My bad.

1448
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,280
What? Didn't they kind of celebrate it?

1449
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,280
Bomani style re-did their site, so that's another one.

1450
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,280
I guess that's 20 November-ish, I don't know.

1451
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,280
That's 19 November-ish.

1452
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:48,280
Any other websites that re-did special things for 2020 November? I can't think of any that can.

1453
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:50,280
DDR Spot was probably the biggest one.

1454
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:56,280
DnR Maniacs deleted my account along with 2,000 other ones, so I guess that's 20 November related.

1455
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,280
Sorta.

1456
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,280
Big oops.

1457
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,280
Happy 20 November!

1458
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,280
Happy 20 November!

1459
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:05,980
I went to bed and then I went to work. Yes, how did you

1460
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:09,820
privately celebrate 20 November amongst ourselves in the room? What was your own

1461
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,500
way of celebrating 20 November?

1462
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:16,140
Well, first of all I went to bed and then I woke up and went to work

1463
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:19,540
and instead of doing my work I talked on

1464
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,580
my email with my friend in Maryland

1465
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:26,580
and then I went home and I failed 20 November

1466
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:31,100
in sixth style on seven key because it's a seven star and I can't pass any yet, although

1467
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:34,700
close and then I put it away

1468
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:39,500
and went online and posted on a bunch of message boards and then played Animal Crossing

1469
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,740
and then I told you November again

1470
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:48,500
yeah and I full comboed some songs but I forgot what they were

1471
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:53,460
and I passed Fantasy. You go girl! I passed Fantasy and Light 7 on 4th style

1472
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:57,300
alright that was like one of the last two songs I had to do but I fucking hate

1473
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,380
Get On Beat thank you

1474
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,380
Next.

1475
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,380
Loki, how did you celebrate 20 November?

1476
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:04,380
Oh, I did one more thing. I did one more thing.

1477
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,380
I went to bed.

1478
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,380
I played DDR at lunch.

1479
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,380
That's it.

1480
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:14,380
Alright, yes. Bradley, how did you celebrate 20 November?

1481
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:16,380
Mmm, I didn't really do much of anything.

1482
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,380
Bless me!

1483
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,380
JP, how did you celebrate 20 November?

1484
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,380
I secretly worshipped Jini Ram.

1485
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:28,460
How's that different from any other day?

1486
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,780
That means he had a faptastic time.

1487
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,140
He had a faptastic 20 November, yes.

1488
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:35,020
Thank you, Jamie.

1489
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:36,660
How did I celebrate 20 November?

1490
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:42,360
I went to work, I came home, I watched 24, I continued my three week streak of not playing

1491
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:46,100
any DDR, jerked off and went to bed.

1492
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,100
Just kidding.

1493
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,100
Fascinating.

1494
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,100
Or at least you'll never know.

1495
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,100
Yes, Logie?

1496
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:54,100
You know, I know this is really the wrong segment to be doing this.

1497
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,100
That's alright.

1498
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:58,100
But I just remembered another F.U. for the week.

1499
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,100
And it goes...

1500
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,100
Wait, wait, wait, you don't need to play the music.

1501
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,100
You don't need to play the music.

1502
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:04,100
Oh, fine.

1503
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,100
Jamie demands I play the music. Therefore, I play the music.

1504
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:15,100
F.U. to the Sac-Bomani server for fucking crashing constantly all this week.

1505
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:16,100
That's it.

1506
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,100
That's it.

1507
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,100
Oh, also...

1508
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:21,100
Yeah, but you can pay for any place to host us.

1509
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:27,700
F you to sacmomani.com as well for not having the space on it to host the Orange Lounge

1510
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:30,860
forums as well, because that kind of caused the crash, because I was kind of trying to

1511
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:34,600
set up a little surprise for 20 November for Orange Lounge, and that kind of pushed us

1512
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:35,600
over quota.

1513
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,600
My bad.

1514
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,600
No.

1515
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,440
And F you for Rob for the...

1516
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:43,880
My account got deleted yet again from another glitch I happen to be...

1517
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:48,540
If you're the one that posts that causes the quota to get hit, then you get your account

1518
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,540
deleted.

1519
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,540
Lucky me!

1520
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:53,940
Because I'm always online posting, whatever.

1521
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:56,380
You got a bigger post count out of it, I think, anyway.

1522
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,380
As if that stuff didn't...

1523
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:58,380
Oh no, you didn't.

1524
01:55:58,380 --> 01:55:59,380
I don't know.

1525
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:00,380
I guessed.

1526
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,380
Not that matters.

1527
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:02,380
You're still number one!

1528
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,380
It don't matter!

1529
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,380
Shit!

1530
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,740
I'm 500 posts above anyone else.

1531
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:10,020
We'll get you to your ho and back, lickety-split!

1532
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:13,020
No shit!

1533
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:24,220
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back, and we're going to announce the winner

1534
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,900
of the Bamani cage match.

1535
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:28,380
There is still time to vote.

1536
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,780
Just come to our chat room and vote via private message for the zippers with All Around the

1537
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:35,900
World or the Final Fantasy VII string machine.

1538
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:39,220
Or you can send it over email, orangelaungeradio.yahoo.com.

1539
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:42,780
And there's a conversation in the chat room going on right now saying, I worked on a Brilliant

1540
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:15,660
There's two vocal mixes of flotation, this is the other one that you don't normally hear

1541
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,660
on Orange Lounge.

1542
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,660
But you're going to hear it right now, so enjoy.

1543
01:57:46,660 --> 01:58:13,660
Follow me with a friend of mine Load away, leave it all behind

1544
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:57,660
I'm not, you're always standing on my side of me

1545
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:11,660
Standing on my side of me

1546
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:19,660
Oh, oh, oh Proud of me

1547
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:32,660
Oh, oh, oh Proud of me

1548
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:39,660
Leave an end of mine, go away

1549
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:46,660
Leave it all behind, follow me

1550
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:53,660
Leave an end of mine, go away

1551
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:55,660
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

1552
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:48,500
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

1553
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,500
The Orange Lounge Bamani Music and More Show.

1554
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:57,500
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

1555
02:04:57,500 --> 02:05:04,500
It's unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1556
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:07,500
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 21.

1557
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:14,500
And now it's time to reveal the winner of the Big Bamani Cage Match.

1558
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:20,500
Tonight in the cage match we had the Zippers with All Around the World.

1559
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:23,500
Let me play a little clip of that for you to remind you what this sounds like.

1560
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:31,500
That was the Zippers with All Around the World.

1561
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:35,500
And the other song we played was the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.

1562
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:44,640
All right, those are the two songs that were in the cage match tonight, and I am pleased

1563
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:52,300
to announce the winner is, by a pretty close vote, not too far apart, the winner is the

1564
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:57,540
Final Fantasy VII String Machine, ladies and gentlemen.

1565
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:58,540
All right.

1566
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,540
People have taste.

1567
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:01,820
You have renewed my faith in humanity.

1568
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:06,300
So the Final Fantasy VII string machine will be added into the Orange Lounge playlist this

1569
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:07,300
week.

1570
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:11,100
So check for that during the Bimani Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day,

1571
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:13,940
7 days a week on this station when we aren't here.

1572
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,940
Sorry JB, Zipper's lost.

1573
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:19,820
I'm gonna kill everybody who voted for it.

1574
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:21,620
I'll give you all the names after the show.

1575
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:26,720
Alright, and if you want a copy of that Final Fantasy VII remix, it's an overclocked remix

1576
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,460
so you can find it on Overclock.org.

1577
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:32,340
Or if you want the zippers, you can contact me.

1578
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:34,060
If you want the zippers, just contact JB.

1579
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:35,700
Or anything else.

1580
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:36,700
Anything?

1581
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,700
Favors?

1582
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,700
No.

1583
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,700
Like favors?

1584
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:40,700
Oh, yes.

1585
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:44,140
I think Mr. Spanky has some things he needs done.

1586
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:47,180
That's quite all right.

1587
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:49,740
Does Mr. Spanky need to be spanked?

1588
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:53,980
Some quick things, some things that have been coming through the chat room and some various

1589
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:57,860
little stories as the two hours have already passed that we've been on the air.

1590
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:34,860
the next two Saturdays and my F.U. to his birthday for being next Monday.

1591
02:07:57,860 --> 02:08:01,860
I'm not falling through, and I promise.

1592
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:04,580
We got a nephew over email.

1593
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,700
Muhimer of New Jersey.

1594
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,700
Moo.

1595
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:08,700
Moo.

1596
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:11,140
He says, a fuck you goes out to his mom.

1597
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:12,140
I'm sorry, not his mom.

1598
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:13,820
I'm sorry.

1599
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:17,020
A fuck you goes out to his room for being small.

1600
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,260
That's what happens when I have the mouse over the R-O.

1601
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,820
I just assume it's another word that ends in O-M. My bad.

1602
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:22,740
Sorry.

1603
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:26,900
That was a big fuck you going out to his room for being small.

1604
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:32,060
nothing wrong with small rooms. I have a small room. It's all about stacking. Stacking will

1605
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:38,180
save you so much space. I've got like 400 DVDs, a whole bunch of movies, a computer,

1606
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:43,660
seven game systems, a queen size bed, and I still have room to move. And this studio

1607
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:47,540
that we do this very show in is very small, as JB learned for the first time today. That's

1608
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:52,340
why you go to Walmart and you get those stacky crates and put your stuff in them. No, you

1609
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:59,340
go to Kmart because remember Kmart is my favorite store I shot there cause I is poor. Yay Kmart.

1610
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:07,180
That was a cheer that they used to do in high school on the bus going to the band. Alright

1611
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:12,180
and I would like to fuck you to Kmart for like a sock going down the tooth. You have

1612
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:18,180
Kmart socks? Yeah cause like my dad gave me. Just like my dad. This is sort of a trash

1613
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:22,540
one time thing. My dad's like, that's how it sucks. Somehow I didn't suck. Somehow

1614
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:27,540
they went up like $13 one time. And then they crashed down to like a dollar and now they're

1615
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:33,540
like 50 cents. But I've been holding them just for experiences to watch. A dying company.

1616
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:37,340
I'm pretty sure they'll be with Lynn.

1617
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:43,460
I have another FU. Muhimer had two FUs. Please allow me to finish. Also, fuck swishy pants

1618
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:46,940
cuz they're doing

1619
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:48,700
it's what you get

1620
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:53,660
they sell it but they have to do that is so signed over there

1621
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:55,780
we should be at what's up with that

1622
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:58,820
now i remember it never is with george okay

1623
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:02,900
yet but i think that that would grab next to each other up together to play

1624
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:05,820
for so fast

1625
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:10,840
and it was like when he's going to be a grant

1626
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:13,420
I wonder, what about D.E.R. and Swishy Pants?

1627
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:15,640
That would be...

1628
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:18,720
Max 300 and Swishy Pants. That would be funny.

1629
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:19,960
You can see this.

1630
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:26,400
God, we're getting more F.U.s a little late. This is it. No more F.U.s. These are the last ones, alright?

1631
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,320
F.U. to Raver's Groove or whatever.

1632
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,800
D.T. was one of the poor, unfortunate souls that got to your Raver's Groove play on Orange

1633
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,220
Lounge about six times in an hour.

1634
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:37,720
Let me play.

1635
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:42,240
It happens to be one of my favorites okay, and it's not my fault that that happened. It's not the song's fault

1636
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:44,240
So get over it

1637
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:47,240
and the claws show

1638
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:49,960
alright

1639
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
Let's see

1640
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,660
F you at late f you

1641
02:10:57,900 --> 02:10:59,900
Yeah

1642
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:04,080
If you two kids on the pad while I'm playing and I'm like bitch get off

1643
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:14,800
off? Bitch. 23rd Magus says, this is a nephew, he has a little story he'd like to tell, please.

1644
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:20,200
Here's a story of a lovely F-you. It's not an F-you, it's a different one. He said, this

1645
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:24,000
is how he celebrated 20 November. Reading music, reading music. This is a late 20 November

1646
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,760
story, I'm sorry. I don't have 20, I have a T November, that'll just have to work. I

1647
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,600
I don't have 20 November queued up, and I don't feel like pulling up.

1648
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,480
Uh, late 19, 20 November celebration story.

1649
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,680
I went to the roof of the school and yelled out,

1650
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:41,840
Beeee, Mani, at the top of my lungs. No, seriously. I did. Yep.

1651
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:44,520
And then I took the deer-in-the-headlights looks.

1652
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,800
Loser! I mean...

1653
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:47,080
Hey, now. Be nice.

1654
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:48,680
That was cool.

1655
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:51,040
I think that's cool. Especially the deer-in-the-headlights parts.

1656
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,920
Anything that'll get you deer-in-the-headlights looks are awesome.

1657
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,640
Fabulous. Fabulous.

1658
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:59,720
Did he mention he was doing it dressed up like Mr. Spanky?

1659
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:03,720
I don't want to see him dressed as Mr. Spanky, I'm sorry.

1660
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:04,720
Alright.

1661
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:08,720
Those were the late FUs and things of the week.

1662
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:09,720
So there you go.

1663
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:14,720
You can always send your FUs in a little early if you're not going to be here for the live show.

1664
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,720
You can always send those over e-mail or on the launchradio at yahoo.com.

1665
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,720
That's what Dave did tonight and he got his in.

1666
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,720
I have an important announcement to make.

1667
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:21,720
Yes?

1668
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:27,720
I got the hooker to have sex with me in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

1669
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:28,720
Thank you very much.

1670
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,720
much.

1671
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:36,240
Well, isn't that special?

1672
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:39,840
Hookers are the work of the devil.

1673
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,400
Alright.

1674
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:46,440
Satan's little play pal.

1675
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:49,000
Let's see.

1676
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,800
I'm hoping the other people left, that we're in the house right now.

1677
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,800
Are they really?

1678
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:24,320
I had some, oh, and now I'm getting 20 November stories, that's alright, we need something

1679
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:31,320
the show

1680
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:34,000
about it

1681
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:41,000
on twenty november his friend broke his arm

1682
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:46,660
uh... twenty-third magis sense of the randomness here he says

1683
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:50,520
my english essay was titled i was shocked and all i got was lousy roast

1684
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,440
beef

1685
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:56,600
hot hot hot

1686
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,320
that has nothing to do with twenty november silly

1687
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:02,760
uh... socal kicks wants to point out he broke his arm in soccer not like

1688
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:05,200
drinking off or anything

1689
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:08,920
well that would have been a lot more humorous don't you think? that would have been cool

1690
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:13,020
it would have been seriously

1691
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:16,920
really clumsy

1692
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,040
that was so eight days a week

1693
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,040
breaking your neck

1694
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,600
trying to uh...

1695
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:25,600
perform self-fulatia.

1696
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,020
OK, this one last one... no more 20 Nm stories, we don't care.

1697
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:33,220
I'm just kidding. DCB says he played Beatmania's second mix and got a

1698
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:34,920
100% greats on Overdozer.

1699
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:39,620
You're special. You are very very special.

1700
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,000
Alright, no more 20...

1701
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,380
what? What? This is actually Pimani related. Oh, dear God, what?

1702
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:51,480
And because of 20 November, happened to be falling on a Wednesday,

1703
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:53,480
There was a new Naoki Journal.

1704
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:54,480
Yes.

1705
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,480
Boo!

1706
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:59,480
Yeah, well, they announced the new Naoki Underground song, which, I mean...

1707
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,480
Now, that's cool.

1708
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,480
Naoki Underground stuff is good.

1709
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:04,480
I mean, you've got, um...

1710
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:09,480
You've got Insertion, and you've got, uh, whatever that French song...

1711
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,480
Le Moi et Le Beaté, or whatever.

1712
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:12,480
Yeah, whatever that crap is.

1713
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,480
Anyways, uh...

1714
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:19,480
So, um, they announced the new song Tears.

1715
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:53,640
the bell where Jessie has a breakdown, because she's addicted to caffeine pills, and I watched

1716
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:55,640
that on 20 November.

1717
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:56,640
What?

1718
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,640
Caffeine pills?

1719
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:01,800
She was addicted to caffeine pills!

1720
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:06,240
And then she's just going and then she's like, I'm so excited, I'm so excited, I'm so scared!

1721
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:10,280
It was the finest acting Elizabeth Berkley's ever done next to Showgirls.

1722
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:13,800
Aside from grinding her hip into some poor stranger.

1723
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:20,360
Okay, you mean, you gotta, you would've, I mean, I'm sorry, but even if it was an acting

1724
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:27,280
situation, that's to be high, oh, damn, we got the scene wrong, do again, oh yeah, oh,

1725
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:35,120
got it wrong again, I love my job, alright, okay, let's go to, oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm

1726
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:41,800
just not feeling that, we gotta do it again, yeah, where's the emotion, do again, this

1727
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:45,280
This time, we'll take those still photos.

1728
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,560
Once more, with feeding.

1729
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,560
Let's go to the news.

1730
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:53,800
This is something that really doesn't have anything to do with Bemani, but it's kind

1731
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:55,320
of funny anyway.

1732
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:59,300
I know a lot of people that play Bemani eat a lot of fast food, and a lot of people also

1733
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:01,880
kind of play Bemani as a way to diet.

1734
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:02,880
Some people play.

1735
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:05,460
I admit, when I started playing DDR, I thought it was cool because I was suddenly losing

1736
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:06,460
weight.

1737
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:09,160
Of course, now that I haven't played DDR in about a month, I'm gaining it all back, but

1738
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,160
that's beside the point.

1739
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:17,160
I read this funny little article and get your guys' thoughts on it.

1740
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:47,160
is

1741
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,420
okay

1742
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:54,420
lawyers claim that big backs make kids fat

1743
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:56,480
well

1744
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:59,140
are big max hazardous to children's health

1745
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:02,520
lawyers a file the class-action lawsuit against mcdonald's on behalf of new

1746
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:06,200
york children who have suffered health problems including diabetes high blood

1747
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:07,640
pressure and obesity

1748
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:11,160
In a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, a lawyer alleged that the fast food chain

1749
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,760
has created a national epidemic of obese children.

1750
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,080
Samuel Hirsch agreed that the high fat, sugar and cholesterol content of McDonald's food

1751
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:25,520
is a very incepted, toxic kind of thing when ingested regularly by young kids.

1752
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:30,160
The plaintiffs include a Bronx teen who ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while

1753
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,920
living in a homeless shelter.

1754
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:37,080
Another is a 13-year-old boy from Staten Island who says he ate McDonald's food three to four

1755
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:43,160
four times a week, and is now five foot four and two hundred and seventy-eight pounds.

1756
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:46,880
McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman insisted that the lawsuit was a frivolous attempt to cash

1757
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:50,320
in on the golden arches, the kind of lawsuit that shouldn't be in court.

1758
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:53,600
People don't go to sleep and then wake up obese, Lerman said.

1759
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:58,360
The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and french fries do to us have

1760
02:18:58,360 --> 02:19:00,920
been with us for a long, long time.

1761
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:06,320
McDonald's has asked Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the case, arguing those who filed

1762
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:10,880
the claims cannot show their health woes were caused by Big Macs and insisting the company

1763
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:18,040
has never misled customers about his food. The judge did not immediately rule on the

1764
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:19,040
request.

1765
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:20,040
What was that?

1766
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,040
We had the visitor just come in.

1767
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:26,960
Dude, all I gotta say is, fucking exercise, you lazy bastard. Shit, man, I eat fast food

1768
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:31,080
every day of the week, you know, and I'm not like some big tub of lard that's like walking

1769
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:38,080
here

1770
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,480
you sound like the for you just then

1771
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:44,360
here

1772
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:47,720
okay

1773
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,080
uh...

1774
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:54,080
but

1775
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,600
it's a bit chastising

1776
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:57,160
low-key

1777
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,640
anyway

1778
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,520
So what did you think about the Big Mac story?

1779
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:06,320
First of all, McDonald's is disgusting and I haven't eaten there in easily four years.

1780
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:10,040
Except that they had those really tasty bagel sandwiches.

1781
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:14,160
DCB and Orange Beanie were in the chat room suggesting that the following

1782
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,200
should go along with this.

1783
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:18,160
This place is a rock.

1784
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:21,900
It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.

1785
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:24,500
It is a good place to listen to the music.

1786
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:31,500
people flock here to get down to the rock music. Rock and roll McDonald's! Rock and

1787
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:39,940
roll McDonald's! Rock and roll McDonald's! Yes, rock and roll McDonald's, ladies and

1788
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:44,540
gentlemen. See, if everybody would just rock and roll a little bit, while they're at McDonald's

1789
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:48,900
eating Big Macs, maybe they wouldn't get so fat. Well, you know, they put the nutritional

1790
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:54,760
information, they're easily readable. I don't know, maybe most of the people who eat there

1791
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:59,180
are illiterate, I don't know. You know, those people eating those Big Macs are the same

1792
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:05,380
people who think the smoking doesn't hurt anyway, the things that the government's not

1793
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:12,380
corrupt, and they have no tune with the obvious at all. It's like, huh? Those are unhealthy

1794
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:17,620
like, huh? Those are unhealthy for me? Don't you think someone would tell me that?

1795
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:23,600
This goes back to people being really stupid, okay? People are going to watch TV, and they're

1796
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,720
going to see this on there, and they're thinking, oh, that looks, even though they're basically

1797
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:31,560
looking at big piles of glycerin that are colored so they don't melt into light or something,

1798
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:35,200
they're looking at this and they're thinking, oh, well, that looks tasty, and it's so ingrained

1799
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,960
into society that the general masses, who are unfortunately really stupid, are going

1800
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:45,200
fall for it. You know what I think is very funny, I don't know if this goes hand in hand,

1801
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:50,640
but since I stopped watching TV so much, I've eaten out so often, at least at major chains.

1802
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,400
There's this one lady that works at McDonald's that has no teeth.

1803
02:21:56,320 --> 02:22:01,280
But the whole thing is, is that it's a matter of choice in using your brain,

1804
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:05,280
and unfortunately people just don't know how to use their brain. They want to be

1805
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:10,000
sheep like everybody else. There's this one chick at the McDonald's that we used to go to actually

1806
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:16,160
that it's just some Chinese chick with an eyepatch. We used to go, ARRRRR! Every time

1807
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:22,760
we'd get our stuff from her, it was quite funny. That's kind of mean. ARRRRR, me tea!

1808
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:29,220
We called it Macarena. Hand over me Big Mac! One thing I have to say about McDonald's,

1809
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:34,100
one time I went to McDonald's, this one where I buy my work, and I ordered two hamburgers

1810
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:38,000
without cheese and without onions, because I cannot fucking stand McDonald's onions.

1811
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,000
the nastiest fucking shit on this earth. Dehydrated onions? What the hell is up with that?

1812
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
They're awesome. They're awesome. I love them.

1813
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I like them.

1814
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Gross. Anyway.

1815
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I like them.

1816
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Well, F you to Bradley for liking McDonald's onions.

1817
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Fuck you for not liking them.

1818
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,700
Okay. So, I order my burger without cheese and without onions, right? I get it back to

1819
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:59,820
work. I open it up, and what do I find? I go, gosh, this hamburger seems awfully thin.

1820
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:06,400
I bite into it. No meat. I bit into two pieces of bread covered in ketchup and mustard and

1821
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:13,400
pickles. Fuck McDonald's, God. But this is what happened. My coworker, since I'm kind

1822
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:19,200
of a pussy, I let people walk all over me like that. My coworker heard me, I was running,

1823
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,240
of course, only the way I could do, I started, you know, what's the first thing I'm going

1824
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:25,360
to do when I get a bad burger? I run around and show all my coworkers, oh, look how McDonald's

1825
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:27,960
fucked me over. And I'm like, well, let's eat a burger, and I open it up where I took

1826
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:31,620
a bite. And my coworker's like, you're not going to put up with that crap, are you? So

1827
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:36,360
he calls and he got me two free meals at McDonald's. This was about six weeks ago, and I said,

1828
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:40,800
still haven't used my free meals to McDonald's like here more poison for you

1829
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:44,600
so if you want to a free meal at McDonald's just go over to McDonald's on

1830
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:47,780
Madison and hazel and tell them that never mind I'm not gonna tell you who

1831
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:55,560
sent you it's not under my name all right they're dumbasses that's the same

1832
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:59,880
place I went there we're getting our meal and the guys and talking it through

1833
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:03,760
the PA system out we're gonna know where the drive-through stuff is he's like

1834
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:05,760
Kenny!

1835
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:07,760
It's because his friend ran out to the car.

1836
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:09,760
Kenny!

1837
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,760
Kenny!

1838
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,760
Kenny, I know you can hear me!

1839
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,760
Meanwhile, we're sitting in the window going

1840
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,760
Food?

1841
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,760
Give us our food?

1842
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,760
Kenny! Give me a $6 burger!

1843
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,760
Kenny!

1844
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,760
Kenny!

1845
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:27,760
I'm like, fucker! Just give me the god damn food!

1846
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:29,760
It was like sitting on the back counter.

1847
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,760
I could see it with my own eyes.

1848
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:40,480
own eyes like can't reach food he's a Kenny the guy was fucking dumbass that's

1849
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:46,000
all I have to say oh my god they killed Kenny um ah yes orange beanie saying

1850
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:53,720
meat is bad just be a vegetarian and don't eat McDonald's as bad I used to

1851
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:56,480
date a vegan and it was really interesting going to McDonald's because

1852
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:01,080
they couldn't even eat the fries really so oh you gotta go was that your pager

1853
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:02,360
Say bye to everybody.

1854
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:03,840
Any closing thoughts from JB?

1855
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:04,840
Jenny Rome.

1856
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,840
Thank you, JB.

1857
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:08,680
Need pork, daddy!

1858
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:12,040
That's all I had to say about that.

1859
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:16,440
Alright, so I was reading some things in the talkback for that story because those are

1860
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:17,880
always interesting to read.

1861
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:22,400
I'm gonna get drunk and sue Budweiser, said one person.

1862
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:23,400
Let's see.

1863
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:25,720
Hey fat people, what's this one say?

1864
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:28,600
You have no one else to blame but yourselves, kids blame your fat parents.

1865
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:29,880
I am skinny and I am McDonald's.

1866
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:32,980
If you have a predisposition to gaining weight, simply don't eat there.

1867
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:35,900
I can believe I have to educate stupid fat people.

1868
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:38,980
Stop thinking about food for just one second, and maybe then you'll realize how pathetic

1869
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:40,120
your argument is.

1870
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:42,940
And please don't ruin it for those of us who enjoy Big Macs and eat responsibly, Ona.

1871
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:44,780
Have you ever heard of exercise?

1872
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:46,100
Self-centered greedy fat bastards.

1873
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:47,100
My word!

1874
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:48,900
The potty mouse on Yahoo Talkback.

1875
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:49,900
Hey, Rob.

1876
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:55,160
There's another headline I saw on Yahoo, because you know Yahoo has always the best headlines.

1877
02:25:55,160 --> 02:26:00,520
It was some stupid kid, um, they threw a flaming chair at this kid in the back of a pickup

1878
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:01,520
truck.

1879
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:02,520
Okay.

1880
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:05,560
And they were driving, okay, and this kid was part of it, and they were filming him.

1881
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,560
And he hit him.

1882
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:07,560
It was one of those jackass.

1883
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:12,220
And he got hurt, and they said, oh, it must have been from a jackass stunt.

1884
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:17,640
I'm like, what, so every dumb thing that stupid kids do and catch on camera is a jackass stunt?

1885
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,640
Yes.

1886
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,640
No.

1887
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:21,120
I don't think so.

1888
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:22,960
It's funny, they have a part where you can rate the top.

1889
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:23,960
Look, you don't play that.

1890
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:27,160
I don't play that shit.

1891
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:28,640
You know what I think?

1892
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:32,820
I think that all those, back to the topic at hand, the fast food crap,

1893
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:36,280
I think that those places actually,

1894
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:38,320
they need to be,

1895
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:42,520
if they were subsidized for having a healthy menu and high quality food,

1896
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:46,360
which they could still make just as fast as the cheap crap that, you know,

1897
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:48,760
is so bad for you,

1898
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:54,420
if they were offered a government subsidy for providing good food to people

1899
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:56,240
that would actually

1900
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,540
i think improve a lot of the

1901
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:59,660
the health of

1902
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:00,840
consumers

1903
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:02,800
and possibly get them repeat business

1904
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:05,460
but you know the thing is our government doesn't give a shit about it anyway

1905
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:09,280
well they've kind of improved their stuff, I mean they changed their fry recipe around to make it

1906
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,140
like a lot less oil and there's less fat grams and stuff in there so

1907
02:27:13,140 --> 02:27:16,200
they're doing stuff i mean

1908
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:22,200
Why? I mean, we go there, we know what's in the food, we know that it's not meat between those patties, or between the bread.

1909
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:27,200
Even so, as a manufacturer, you do have a responsibility to your consumer.

1910
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,200
What about if they just put a DDR machine in every McDonald's?

1911
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,200
Two Big Macs and shitty ROM!

1912
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:34,200
What's up?

1913
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:36,200
Oh, that's that game for fags!

1914
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,200
Oh, I'm gonna eat my burger!

1915
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,200
Oh, heart attack! Ugh! Die!

1916
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:52,120
It just has to do with people caring enough about themselves and being smart enough to

1917
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,520
know what's good for them.

1918
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:54,520
Love yourself!

1919
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:56,800
No, I'm serious about this.

1920
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:05,560
I work in an office, I work by lots of food places, but even so, even if you have to go

1921
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:10,440
out and eat, you're going to be able to find an alternative to the typical fast food chain

1922
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:12,320
and find something healthy.

1923
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,760
There's this bagel cafe place that's near where I work.

1924
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:18,920
I can go there and get a turkey sandwich with avocado and mayonnaise and everything, and

1925
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:19,920
that's nice and healthy.

1926
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:24,960
Or I could go get freshly made teriyaki at another place just as fast.

1927
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:29,520
It's certainly more satisfying than going and getting a piece of bread that's been in

1928
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:36,160
a bag for five years, and this piece of something that's supposed to resemble meat that probably

1929
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:42,760
still has the green ink stamp from when they stamped the damn thing in the first place.

1930
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:43,760
You can look at this.

1931
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:51,160
You can pay $5 and get this unsatisfying piece of shit burger and this soda which you're

1932
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:54,720
actually paying about ten times what the value of the soda is.

1933
02:28:54,720 --> 02:29:00,400
You can go buy a bottle of juice and get yourself a nice sandwich and overall, your body's going

1934
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:05,080
to thank you for it and people who complain they don't have any energy, they're not going

1935
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:09,200
to have that complaint anymore because they're actually going to be fueling themselves.

1936
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:10,640
There's the difference right there.

1937
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:15,040
And also, there have been studies linked that prove that eating a consistent diet of fast

1938
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,560
food also does contribute to stupidity.

1939
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:21,720
Your brain functions are not as...

1940
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:24,840
Your brain doesn't function as properly when you're eating nothing but shit.

1941
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:25,840
Actually I heard just the opposite.

1942
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:34,960
They just did a study on the news saying that snack foods give actually higher test results

1943
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:37,960
in a short period of time.

1944
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:38,960
That's not fast food, though.

1945
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:43,960
The thing is, if you eat any carbohydrate, it's going to increase your brain function.

1946
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:46,960
Bombay has another great suggestion in the chat room.

1947
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:48,960
How about you cook instead of eating in a fast food place?

1948
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:50,960
Exactly!

1949
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,960
I'm just talking about for people when you're at work and you haven't brought your lunch or something.

1950
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:54,960
You know, there's alternatives.

1951
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:57,960
Because I'm lazy and McDonald's takes two minutes to get, okay?

1952
02:29:57,960 --> 02:30:00,960
That's what it comes down to, and I love their goddamn fries.

1953
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:08,960
I can't stand the stupid people. I can't stand to go inside there. I can't stand to smell the ugly, nasty people that are in there. The smell is horrible.

1954
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:17,960
This also goes back to those people who are on those low-carb diets. They don't realize that when they're eating no carbohydrates, they're actually killing themselves.

1955
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:24,960
The state of ketosis, basically, is the state that your body goes into when it's about to die. When it starts feeding on itself.

1956
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:31,200
The same people who are making this argument right here are the same people who go and

1957
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:37,300
supersize their extra value meal and they get Diet Coke.

1958
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:39,020
You know how many calories that saves them?

1959
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:44,580
They're making Diet Vanilla Coke now, did you hear that?

1960
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,700
Say that you're going to Burger King and you're getting a Whopper.

1961
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:51,740
First of all, a Whopper has a calorie count of 750 calories, your typical Whopper does.

1962
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:54,160
When you add your fries to it, you're adding another 300.

1963
02:30:54,160 --> 02:31:02,780
there. You have in your hands the entire equivalent of a day's meal. I mean, an entire, you know,

1964
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:08,720
you have your whole day of eating in one meal. You know, changing your Coke from regular

1965
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:13,580
to diet, you're basically removing 200 calories of that. That's incredibly stupid. But you

1966
02:31:13,580 --> 02:31:22,920
know what? That's how they make their money. I drink 300 calorie hot chocolate. You're

1967
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:31,060
some dairy from it. Actually, it's instant hot chocolate. They have enzymes in them.

1968
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:35,740
It's so chocolatey and good, I can't deny it. It's actually three packets of hot chocolate

1969
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:41,460
mix because one and two are just not enough. Also, chocolate is good for your endorphins.

1970
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:50,940
It helps you release happy chemicals. Sounds happy. Yeah, it's an aphrodisiac. I'm sorry

1971
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:56,100
for getting all brainy on people. I used to work at a GNC and an herb shop, so this is

1972
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:57,100
all stuff that I had to go.

1973
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:00,620
I hope people don't really expect us to talk three hours completely about DDR.

1974
02:32:00,620 --> 02:32:01,820
Herbal shop, huh?

1975
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:10,500
Oh yeah, I can tell you what to do when you have a cold. Or, you know, maybe we should

1976
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:12,620
make this a regular thing, you know, health talk.

1977
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:15,940
Health chat, DDR dieting, workout mode.

1978
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,940
Well, seriously.

1979
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:17,940
On Orange Lounge.

1980
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:22,780
It also goes hand-in-hand with playing, you know, the DDR and pada-pada.

1981
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:26,960
This is why I agree that this topic is kind of relevant, it actually really is relevant

1982
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:31,340
to the Bonnie community, because like I said, a lot of people play Be-Bonnie to stay fit.

1983
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:33,960
It's one of the things that appeal to them about the game.

1984
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:39,500
And I'm mad at Golf Land because they're trying to make me impotent, Link.

1985
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:43,600
They got rid of my surgery and replaced it with Mountain Dew.

1986
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:45,440
Mountain Dew's bad.

1987
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:47,000
It tastes like pee.

1988
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,440
I want my surge.

1989
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:49,440
Oh my god, I don't drink...

1990
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:50,440
Hence the nickname Mountain Dew.

1991
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:53,240
That's all I ever drink is Mountain Dew.

1992
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:54,240
Mountain Spew.

1993
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:58,000
Does Mountain Dew really make you impotent?

1994
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,560
It's just all the yellow sticks or whatever it is.

1995
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:03,240
These are really going to matter for me anyway, but...

1996
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:10,120
Ah, they're saying sushi is good, and Orange Beanie says the only meat he'll eat is sushi

1997
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:14,200
on occasion, and then Swiftrock says McDonald's should get sushi!

1998
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:19,560
McDonald's would then you'd get like you'd get like the imitation crab wrapped

1999
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:27,160
up in cabbage instead of nori and an old bun to replace the rice if you if you

2000
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:32,400
did get rice crackers and soak them in water not it will not get the big rice

2001
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:35,520
cakes and soak them in water and then wrap those around a piece of imitation

2002
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:41,520
crab meat and cover it in cabbage I'm being told to look at a Gran Turismo

2003
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:44,280
Vise City story I apparently missed that was going on in the intro.

2004
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:48,840
Gran Turismo, Vise City, shit! You fucker, you're going faster, man! We're gonna kill

2005
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:52,040
you! Okay, SoCalKick says he was watching Channel

2006
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:55,880
4, and this was the explanation of Grand Theft Auto Vise City. Did I say Grand Theft Auto?

2007
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:57,120
I'm sorry. Grand Theft Auto Vise City.

2008
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,960
Oh yeah, that's right, there was supposed to be a news report on that.

2009
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:03,600
Yes, on Channel 4, they said, in the new Grand Theft Auto Vise City, players must beat women,

2010
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,600
kill police, and have sex with prostitutes to progress in the game.

2011
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:09,520
Uh, no. Kill police, yes.

2012
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:11,520
Oh, that's optional.

2013
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:12,520
Cop killer!

2014
02:34:12,520 --> 02:34:18,520
That's optional? I mean, I always just, you know, I fire lots of rockets and watch people explode.

2015
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:21,520
This is how much I actually play PlayStation games, by the way.

2016
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,520
Yeah, well, well, gee, that's not, like, you know, a one-sided opinion there.

2017
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:29,520
Well, you have to do this to, you know, want, first off...

2018
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:31,520
If you want the bonus stage, maybe.

2019
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:33,520
Oh, first off, it's a complete lie.

2020
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,520
Okay, complete lie right there, just totally slandering the game right there.

2021
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:42,440
right there. Stupid bastards. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. No matter what they say, in

2022
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:47,160
fact, yeah, it's going to give them more ratings and more, you know, people are, oh, cool,

2023
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:51,120
that game looks like fun and it's going to sell more copies. It was the highest selling,

2024
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:56,920
highest grossing game last year, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3, so now this time it's

2025
02:34:56,920 --> 02:35:02,280
going to be even better. And it has a story line. It has to do with a drug deal that went

2026
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:08,360
bad. And you have to go kill the people that stole your money.

2027
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:11,440
Well thank you. Bitch better have my money.

2028
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,600
Alright let's shift gears here because I have another topic I'd like to talk about.

2029
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:18,560
And this is kind of a half a few of the week, kind of like a half

2030
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:22,080
let's talk about this interesting topic. Jamie and I yesterday

2031
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:26,980
we went on a little road trip and we went over to Fry's. Remember we went to Fry's?

2032
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:30,560
And what did we see at Fry's but

2033
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:34,280
DDR Max USA being played on a giant screen TV over there.

2034
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:37,280
That guy who played again and again and again and again.

2035
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:38,280
Exactly.

2036
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:39,280
That's my FU of the Week.

2037
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,780
Well, one of my FU's things.

2038
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:44,760
We wanted to play, even though Jamie and I can play at home, you know, of course, how

2039
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:47,920
often do we get to play DDR Max USA in front of a crowd of strangers, you know?

2040
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,680
We wanted to show off a little bit, you know, our egos, stroke our egos a little.

2041
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,280
I almost got the manager.

2042
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:56,640
But these guys just kept playing over and over and over again.

2043
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:57,640
One of them was an employee.

2044
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:58,640
One of them was an employee?

2045
02:35:58,640 --> 02:35:59,640
Seriously?

2046
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:05,160
to getting the manager to have that guy kicked off because, and the thing is the people who

2047
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:07,520
know me know that I will do this.

2048
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:08,520
You were there when I've gotten...

2049
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:09,520
Jamie, don't fuck around.

2050
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:10,520
Yeah.

2051
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:15,800
The thing is, I worked in customer service, okay, for two years.

2052
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:21,680
There's no excuse for bad customer service, and keep in mind this, for every one person

2053
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,800
who calls in or can complain or does a physical complaint, there are eight more people who

2054
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:30,400
who are displeased. And each of these people will go and tell more people. The thing is

2055
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:35,500
if we had more activists in the world, stuff would change. And so I think that that's my

2056
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:38,400
part in trying to make things a little bit better.

2057
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:42,560
So Jamie and I didn't get to play Max in front of a bunch of strangers and we cry.

2058
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:44,400
I had a sniff.

2059
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:49,480
But it was kind of interesting how Fries has really been promoting DDR around here, especially.

2060
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:50,480
I did.

2061
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:53,560
Because I literally, we watched, what, like two or three people, at least I noticed this.

2062
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:55,340
I didn't really say anything to you about it.

2063
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:59,860
But I saw like two or three people, not the ones playing the game, but like families picking

2064
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:04,440
up DDR and a dance pad, like walking out there, and the employees, this is kind of smart,

2065
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:08,120
they did have an employee kind of stationed near the DDR watching the people play, apparently

2066
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:11,940
not keeping very good track, but watching the people play, and then when parents would

2067
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:15,880
kind of look at it curiously, would go up and talk to them about DDR, and suddenly they're

2068
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:20,280
walking out of there with a copy of Max USA, and one of them was walking out with a PlayStation

2069
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:21,280
2.

2070
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:24,240
My boss bought economics for herself.

2071
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:27,840
Make sure that you buy your games at Gamestop, thank you.

2072
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:28,840
Yes.

2073
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:30,720
Buy them at Gamestop.

2074
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:34,840
Reserve your games at the Gamestop in Rancho Cordova.

2075
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:36,880
Jamie's trying to get a little bit of business there.

2076
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:37,880
For my man.

2077
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:38,880
Yes.

2078
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,960
Let me know.

2079
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:46,400
I guess that's a really great way to promote DDR, it's too bad more stores don't do that.

2080
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:51,000
I also did find another couple of cool things at Fry's, speaking of our little trip to Fry's.

2081
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Okay.

2082
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,840
my favorite artist ever I didn't think that any of the stuff was released in

2083
02:37:55,840 --> 02:38:02,120
the US and I was wrong because I found three DJ crush CDs at fries that makes

2084
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:06,880
me happy and I saw the super ghetto cheap CD burners that made me happy yep

2085
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:13,120
they were really cheap yep okay so that was our fry story and that's about it

2086
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:19,640
Oh Loki has something to share damn you fries and making me spend money I go

2087
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:26,040
there with Nintendo buying one thing and I walk out with eight things. I hate you! Being

2088
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:31,200
so cheap! I got my man a really cool birthday present. And by the way, we need to give,

2089
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:37,120
even though he's like not listening and stuff, I have to give a happy birthday to my fiance

2090
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:43,080
Dan, because he's absolutely awesome. Awww. Yeah, Nona, if ever you see him online, he's

2091
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:49,520
either online as Neo Strider, he used to run the Neo Strider Strider Zone, and he also

2092
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:22,520
And I hope he's not listening because I just told him what day President was.

2093
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:55,520
You don't need another voice

2094
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:02,520
If I'm in another world, you can't see another world

2095
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:32,520
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

2096
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:43,240
to the music.

2097
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:48,280
You are back and it's funny in the chat room they're talking about this gacked another

2098
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:53,680
world sounds just like the Josie and the Pussycat song Three Small Words and they're absolutely

2099
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:57,320
right because that wracked my brain for an entire day one time.

2100
02:44:57,320 --> 02:44:58,320
It's okay, but...

2101
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:59,320
What song does it sound like?

2102
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:00,320
But it's better.

2103
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:02,280
Yeah, I like Another World a lot.

2104
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:03,600
I mean, and it is different.

2105
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:04,600
The chorus is a lot different.

2106
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:05,600
We actually did play the gakta version.

2107
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:06,600
The guitar is just very similar.

2108
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:07,600
The guitar is very similar.

2109
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:11,200
We actually did play the gakta version, by the way, which is the only good one that exists.

2110
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:15,240
I was supposed to relay a message to Loki from SoCal Kicks, but I lost it, so retype

2111
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:18,880
that in the chatroom, SoCal, and I'll get that.

2112
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:22,360
No, I don't think it was more work.

2113
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:27,360
I think it was something more about Grand Theft Auto.

2114
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:32,080
All local news sucks because they're stupid and uninformed about anything current, especially

2115
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:33,720
anything that has to do with gaming.

2116
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:43,760
They're like, with those crazy kids and their games, they're so stupid.

2117
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:44,760
That was special.

2118
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:48,280
Well, we're coming down to the home stretch of the show, this three hour tour that we've

2119
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:49,280
got going here.

2120
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:52,320
Is there any other topics that somebody wanted to discuss here tonight, while we still have

2121
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:55,600
time I think we've got everything that I want to set things on fire you want to

2122
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:02,200
set things on fire yes Black Lab set himself on fire tonight after that mr.

2123
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:06,920
stanky bit oh that's right but I miss it no actually we are going to uh as soon

2124
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:09,780
as the show is over we're going on the road we're going over to Davis actually

2125
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:12,880
to go pick up some boba correct Black Lab needs to meet us there yes he does

2126
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:17,720
and towels not listening right now I cry so he can't meet us but I'll call him

2127
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,720
Maybe he'll...

2128
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:23,080
Yeah, Cal's not listening and that's sad.

2129
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:26,480
Why is vidpower suggesting Animal Crossing Vice City?

2130
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:27,480
No.

2131
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:30,120
That would be pretty funny though.

2132
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:32,600
We could like, you know, take our gas from Mallory.

2133
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:34,640
I'd be able to shoot Mallory finally.

2134
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,640
I like Mallory.

2135
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:37,800
I could pop a cap in her ass.

2136
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:39,120
I like Mallory.

2137
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,560
Mallory gives me stuff all the time.

2138
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:45,040
That would be crazy if Grandpa thought of Vice City.

2139
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:49,840
That's okay because I like puddles and you don't like her.

2140
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,160
The network version on the internet.

2141
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:56,160
I'm going to be getting that bug net out and just beating the shit out of puddles.

2142
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:58,760
Anyway, sorry Loki, yes?

2143
02:46:58,760 --> 02:46:59,760
Sorry.

2144
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:00,760
Oh, never mind.

2145
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:04,680
I don't want to talk about my online Grand Theft Auto version anymore because that would

2146
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:05,680
be cool.

2147
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:08,960
Except it would be kind of crazy watching hundreds of people running around with rocket

2148
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,560
launchers trying to kill each other.

2149
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:15,160
It'd be like one giant version of Unreal or Quake or something.

2150
02:47:15,160 --> 02:47:18,240
Black Lab wants to point out that the Boba at Boba, Max is broken.

2151
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:19,480
We're going there for Boba.

2152
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:20,480
Still worth a trip.

2153
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,480
All right, we're going there for Boba.

2154
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,480
That's fine.

2155
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:23,480
We're still coming.

2156
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:24,480
All right.

2157
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:26,800
Now this is what SoCalCakes wanted to tell you.

2158
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,280
Loki, that's what they do.

2159
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:31,480
Do you even know why every supermarket has milk in the back?

2160
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:33,500
It's just like a mental thing.

2161
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:36,040
Most people just go to a supermarket often just for milk.

2162
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:39,880
If it's in the back, they have to go all the way to the back and then for some reason to

2163
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:40,880
pick up other things.

2164
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:46,040
Yeah, that's because they, they, you know, arrange supermarkets and stuff to promote

2165
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:51,120
buying, duh, but, I mean, that has nothing to do with the fact that, you know, they're

2166
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:54,120
saying that the game is, you know, I don't know.

2167
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:56,200
Oh yeah, talking about Fries, yeah.

2168
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:57,200
Oh.

2169
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:59,400
I think, I don't know what that was exactly in reference to.

2170
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:00,400
Oh, Fries.

2171
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:01,400
Yeah, Fries is like a giant maze.

2172
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:04,600
It's like a giant hedge maze that you have to walk through just to get to the checkout

2173
02:48:04,600 --> 02:48:05,600
counter.

2174
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,840
Giant hedge maze, that's all you have to remember.

2175
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:17,840
It's not the fact that they arrange stuff like that, it's just the fact that they're so cheap, so cheap that you can't resist, but the problem is they're all mail-in rebates, no!

2176
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:26,840
But yeah, I love their stuff, I love buying computer stuff, and that's kind of a bad thing. I should stop spending, but that never happens. Never ever.

2177
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:33,840
And I'm still waiting on my bid on eBay for my PS2 and my Japanese PlayStation 2, so I'll probably have one. Yay!

2178
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:37,840
What exactly are you going to play on it?

2179
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:41,840
Well, the first thing I'm going to be doing is getting DDR Max 2 when that comes out.

2180
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:45,840
So, um, you know, I can rip everything from that and whatnot.

2181
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:51,840
But, um, I'm also, one of the first games I'm getting, which I'm also bidding on, is Para Para Para.

2182
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,840
I'm not going to...

2183
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:57,840
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

2184
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:20,840
Yeah, but there's a bunch of other games. You guys are trying to get me into Beatmania 2DX, and I'm thinking that's an expensive investment for something I'm not too excited to be playing, but I don't know. There's also the Drummania drum. I wanted to get the drumset for that and maybe Drummania or something. I don't know.

2185
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:27,840
If you get Dramania, you can bring it to my house and play Session with all my guitar freaks, because I have the PS2 ones.

2186
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:30,840
Session mode is so cool. Yeah.

2187
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:36,840
Being told that Grand Theft Auto crime online is said to be real.

2188
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:39,840
Uh-oh! Hide your children!

2189
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,840
And Loki, you don't want Para Para, it gets boring in three days.

2190
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:47,840
Actually, I'm not sure if he's talking about Para Dramania, but he's saying, you don't want it, it gets boring in three days, that's DCV.

2191
02:49:47,840 --> 02:50:07,840
Well, I know that, duh. I don't play games like after three games anyways. Another reason why I'd want, you know, Para Para is just for the controller, because I get to use it with Step Maniac. Oh yeah, I get to put some crazy shit in there. Basically, it'd be like a really tripped out version of Dance Maniacs. It'll have to do for now until I-

2192
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:08,840
He is talking about Para.

2193
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:12,840
Yeah. It'll have to do until I get, like, you know, Dance Maniacs stuff.

2194
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:14,840
Ooh.

2195
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:18,840
Now he's thinking, how can I make a custom dance maniacs controller?

2196
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:21,840
Well, actually, I could with the Para Para controller.

2197
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:23,840
Yes, you could.

2198
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:26,840
The Para Para Pancakes of Pinkness.

2199
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:29,840
No, no, no, no, no, you got the name wrong.

2200
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:30,840
I'm sorry.

2201
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:31,840
The Pink Biscuits of Death.

2202
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:32,840
The Pink Biscuits of Death.

2203
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:34,840
I like pink pancakes.

2204
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:37,840
They're too big to be pancakes.

2205
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:38,840
They're fat pancakes.

2206
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:41,840
Well, they were saying also that I should get, what was it,

2207
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:46,680
Kingdom Hearts International when that comes out, and Final Fantasy International, hell

2208
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:51,240
I can get Final Fantasy XI right now I guess, I don't know why I'd want to, but.

2209
02:50:51,240 --> 02:51:00,240
Oh hey, Swiftrock is offering to give away his Para Para for a Milpitas Golf Land token.

2210
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:02,240
Okay.

2211
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:04,240
Okay.

2212
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:11,760
Well, go ahead and email the show at orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com and we'll forward that on the Loki

2213
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:55,760
By the way, MakeEditGetPorn is still on, and yeah, I haven't really thought of a date yet that I want to judge everything. I'm just being lazy, so in the meantime, make edits for anything that's on Max USA.

2214
02:51:55,760 --> 02:52:06,760
And I don't care how you make it, just get me a step chart or edit file or DWI or step media file somehow, and yeah, and I'll enter it in.

2215
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:07,760
You can do it!

2216
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:09,760
And you can get porn!

2217
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:17,820
pornography okay it's fap-tastic yes it's a fap-tastic contest being brought

2218
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:22,100
to you by the one I love you I oh we're being it's being suggested we should

2219
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:27,180
invite Polteri to our para para paradise party slash masturbation party no god no

2220
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:33,220
unless we get to like take shots at her all right she can't sing but you know

2221
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:37,220
I don't know if she were to be, I don't know, gagged somehow.

2222
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:40,220
I'll let your mind do the work.

2223
02:52:40,220 --> 02:52:43,220
You got some Para-Paradise you can gag her with?

2224
02:52:43,220 --> 02:52:46,220
I got a pink biscuit for you.

2225
02:52:46,220 --> 02:52:48,220
Stick the mic closer.

2226
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:49,220
That's right.

2227
02:52:49,220 --> 02:52:50,220
Oh yeah.

2228
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:52,220
You know you like it.

2229
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:56,220
Anyway, we're getting close to the end of the show here, so I thought I'd go around

2230
02:52:56,220 --> 02:52:58,220
and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.

2231
02:52:58,220 --> 02:53:00,220
Dude met you at one sick fuck.

2232
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:02,540
That's Jamie's final thought is mad as a sick fuck

2233
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:06,720
Yeah

2234
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:10,180
Correct Loki your final thought for the day

2235
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:19,420
No, I'm I'm tired you're tired it's kendo all right all right my bitches will do anything

2236
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:22,300
Okay, well, maybe not that

2237
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:39,700
The final thought of the day is, run away, run away, run, run, far away, and then run

2238
02:53:39,700 --> 02:53:40,700
back.

2239
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:41,700
What?

2240
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,700
That was great.

2241
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:47,460
That was great.

2242
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:49,020
I didn't get it.

2243
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:51,660
Gendo, are you a pimp?

2244
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:54,660
No!

2245
02:53:54,660 --> 02:53:55,660
That didn't do anything!

2246
02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:59,660
I know, I just like that song.

2247
02:53:59,660 --> 02:54:02,660
Attention Kmart Shoppers!

2248
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:04,660
Attention Kmart Shoppers!

2249
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:07,660
This is Gendo!

2250
02:54:07,660 --> 02:54:13,660
Please report to my office for breast inspection!

2251
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:16,660
Damn it, I hate this part!

2252
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:19,660
Oh baby!

2253
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,660
Oh, dear.

2254
02:54:20,660 --> 02:54:26,460
Where Shinji's in front of the elevator and the elevator opens and it's the Gendo music

2255
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:28,940
and then it closes and the music goes away.

2256
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:36,100
We're talking about an anime parody of Evangelion called Evangelion Re-Death.

2257
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:37,960
It's completely on crack.

2258
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:41,300
That's where the it's Gendo line comes from in the intro.

2259
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:42,300
Yay.

2260
02:54:42,300 --> 02:54:45,020
And we're just quoting it because we can.

2261
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:46,020
We're nerds.

2262
02:54:46,020 --> 02:55:03,020
