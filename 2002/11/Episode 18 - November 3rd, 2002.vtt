The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.400 --> 01:08.400
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.400 --> 01:15.480
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Ms. Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.480
One, one, he's good.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.980
That's not that much.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.480
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
How can you tell?

01:25.480 --> 01:27.480
I never forget a pussy, cat.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.480
Thirty-seven, my girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.480
In a row?

01:31.480 --> 01:33.480
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.480
You are the weakest thing to bite.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.480
So you get nothing, you lose, good day sir.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.480
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:45.480 --> 01:53.980
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
Dark Sakura

01:54.980 --> 01:55.980
I hate nature!

01:55.980 --> 01:58.980
I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
Sky

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
Everything alright?

02:01.980 --> 02:03.980
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.980
Orange Lounge Radio

02:59.220 --> 03:04.420
Loki we got spongy brownies from Dave this life get any better than this

03:04.420 --> 03:06.420
Hey, I have Propella. Life is good.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.420
Except that stupid fly needs to get the hell out of here.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.420
I know, and don't lady just swallow the fly.

03:13.420 --> 03:14.420
I don't know why she swallowed the fly.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.420
Look, he's doing this whole karate kid thing here, trying to catch the fly.

03:19.420 --> 03:24.420
For our listeners, a fly has made it into the studio, and it's going to die sometime during the duration of the show.

03:26.420 --> 03:28.420
Alright, we'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.

03:29.420 --> 03:33.420
First we're going to take an opening break, and we're going to play a bunch of stuff from Max USA.

04:03.420 --> 04:09.200
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

04:09.200 --> 04:13.060
Why, leave me alone, don't tell me why

04:13.060 --> 04:16.760
There is no need to carry on

04:16.760 --> 04:22.200
Leave me alone if I'm not right

04:22.200 --> 04:27.080
And why, leave me alone so many days

04:27.080 --> 04:30.620
Just thinking I've been so many nights

04:30.620 --> 04:35.620
Leave me alone and don't know why

04:35.620 --> 04:37.620
Tell me why

04:42.620 --> 04:44.620
Now tell me why

04:44.620 --> 04:49.620
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.620
And blow me wide

05:19.620 --> 05:37.620
It's a long way to go, honey I know, but I'm a Hawaii, where are we going?

05:37.620 --> 05:40.620
To the dark black forest

06:37.620 --> 07:02.980
We interrupt this music for a special announcement.

07:02.980 --> 07:09.980
Loki has killed the fly.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.480
What we gotta do is build momentum

07:34.480 --> 07:35.980
If you need the right tools and best

07:35.980 --> 07:37.980
Ride the wave, start counting the rhythm of the march

07:37.980 --> 07:39.780
Cause we got new whips and the main engine

07:39.780 --> 07:40.480
Then I know I'll bite

07:40.480 --> 07:42.480
I'll either do it now or you'll have to bang those flowers

07:42.480 --> 07:43.980
Yes, I reckon it's their fault

07:43.980 --> 07:46.480
If you need the right tools, drop your balls

07:47.980 --> 07:49.480
Yeah, yeah, drop your balls

07:51.480 --> 07:52.980
Drop your balls

07:54.480 --> 07:55.980
Let's just keep that ball

07:59.980 --> 08:01.480
Yeah, we got this, build momentum

08:01.480 --> 08:04.480
If you need the right tools and methods to ride the waves and come down to the rivers

08:04.480 --> 08:06.480
Don't rush, just insist we don't get with it

08:06.480 --> 08:08.480
Pain is scary, almighty, what are we even doing now?

08:08.480 --> 08:09.480
You must have been going slower

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
You had no race to take that for

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
And it's up to you to hit that call

08:15.480 --> 08:16.480
You dropped the ball

08:18.480 --> 08:19.480
You dropped the ball

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
You dropped the ball

08:22.480 --> 08:24.480
He dropped that bomb!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
Hey, you dropped that ball!

09:54.480 --> 10:15.600
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.200
Watch all your favorite monster hosts, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki engage in the Bahmani

10:20.200 --> 10:21.200
Battle Royale.

10:21.200 --> 10:27.200
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday at 7 p.m. Pacific time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.200
And be suitable for children under 6, pregnant women, retards, and residents of Baltimore.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.200
Are you ready? Ready for the race? Are you ready?

10:35.200 --> 10:40.200
You're already listening to Orange Lounge Live Radio, but I hadn't played that promo yet during the live show, so I thought I would.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.200
What do six-year-olds and retards have to do with it?

10:44.200 --> 10:49.200
I just decided I'd be random. And if you listen very carefully, it also says residents of Baltimore.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
Baltimore.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.400
And we're picking on Baltimore because when I pulled up the stats for what cities listen

10:53.400 --> 10:56.240
to us the most, Baltimore was in last place.

10:56.240 --> 11:02.560
So we're picking on them, which is a bummer because Baltimore is where all the John Waters

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
films are set.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.960
And if you know me, I love John Waters, so sorry.

11:05.960 --> 11:11.320
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the Max USA crap that we just played for you.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.240
It wasn't crap, it was more like diarrhea.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.800
Max USA just came out this week and we're all happy happy.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.500
It was really special.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.160
I notice we have a lot of new people listening tonight, so I thought I'd point out some things

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
for you.

11:27.160 --> 11:31.180
If you want to join our chat room, just go to any Othercide IRC server.

11:31.180 --> 11:35.760
You're going to just put in your server as IRC.eggheads.org, or you're going to put in

11:35.760 --> 11:38.680
karma.othercideirc.net, either one of those.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.800
That's where all the big Mamani chat rooms are, and you're just going to join Channel

11:41.800 --> 11:43.420
Pound, Orange Lounge.

11:43.420 --> 11:44.800
That's where the cool kids hang out.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
That's right.

11:45.800 --> 11:50.960
If you're too lazy to get on IRC, that's cool, we're making an effort to keep our Yahoo box

11:50.960 --> 11:55.240
online while we're doing the show, so you can just shoot us an email, it's orangeloungeradio,

11:55.240 --> 11:59.040
that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, and we'll check that box throughout

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
the show.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
That's for all the cool kids in the email!

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Thank you!

12:02.040 --> 12:04.520
You want to be a cool kid, don't you?

12:04.520 --> 12:11.040
While we're talking about, you know, station news and events, as you noticed in the beginning

12:11.040 --> 12:14.760
of the show, we have decided to make Loki an official co-host now!

12:14.760 --> 12:16.760
May as well, he's here all the time.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.760
You know, this guy just shows up.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.760
He sits over here. He gives commentary. We give him a segment.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
We don't even let him sit in a chair.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.760
Um, here, I'll just get over.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.760
God damn it! Just like last week, there's people outside the studio here fucking honking at the neighbors.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.760
We don't care!

12:32.760 --> 12:34.760
Shut up!

12:34.760 --> 12:36.760
Um...

12:36.760 --> 12:38.760
Where's my gun?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
Boom!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.760
This is my boomstick!

12:42.760 --> 12:58.760
We realize that your horn works, but we don't need to hear it!

12:58.760 --> 13:01.760
Yes, I'm very happy to be the- Oh, yeah, speech, speech, speech, speech!

13:01.760 --> 13:02.760
Yes.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.760
Thank you for all the little people, all the little people that supported me.

13:07.760 --> 13:11.760
Is it just me, or did the horn get, like, quieter, like it died?

13:11.760 --> 13:17.760
I put the fear of DS into them. Where's my bat? Okay!

13:17.760 --> 13:23.760
No, no, no, I have neighbors, Jamie, I have neighbors.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.760
That horn gets a fuck you.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.760
We'll do the fuck yous of the week with it later.

13:28.760 --> 13:32.760
No, it stopped. It stopped. There you go, everything's fine now. Uh oh, uh oh.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.760
Thank you!

13:34.760 --> 13:37.760
There we go. See, Jamie can be polite, too.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
Yeah.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.760
I'm sorry, did you have anything else to say?

13:40.760 --> 13:42.760
I could have said, thank you bitches. Okay, fuck them.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
He started up again.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.760
I wish we had a microphone outside, but we don't.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.760
So the whole listening public out there is going,

13:48.760 --> 13:50.760
what the hell are they talking about?

13:50.760 --> 13:53.760
Live on the horn, Mike.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.760
Jamie finally shut the window.

13:58.760 --> 14:06.760
Yes, right now I'm having Dave play my DDR Max save game so he can beat my Oni's for me.

14:06.760 --> 14:11.480
suck at the Oni. I suck, I hate Onis, okay? I incredibly hate Onis, and when I found out

14:11.480 --> 14:16.160
that you have to play the Oni courses to unlock songs, that really pissed me off. Well, you

14:16.160 --> 14:22.040
don't have to, but if you want to get them, like, this month... I unlocked a song by failing

14:22.040 --> 14:26.740
one. Now that's cool, that's something, that was the first thing that made me think, gosh,

14:26.740 --> 14:31.720
this game really is for Americans. That you get unlocks by failing things. It's like,

14:31.720 --> 14:33.540
good effort

14:33.540 --> 14:38.480
just got created cyber today

14:38.480 --> 14:41.040
that song was in economics

14:41.040 --> 14:46.720
i love getting on walks from games i already owned

14:46.720 --> 14:50.880
uh... that's my one bitch about max you at the max us having don't get me wrong

14:50.880 --> 14:51.920
great game

14:51.920 --> 14:53.480
pretty kick-ass

14:53.480 --> 14:56.380
one of the best home releases they've done yet i really haven't decided if i

14:56.380 --> 15:00.360
like that makes more if i like this one more but that is good it's definitely by

15:00.360 --> 15:01.360
far

15:01.360 --> 15:02.360
better than

15:02.360 --> 15:05.080
the either the other two games you've got to tell us that's for sure they've

15:05.080 --> 15:07.120
been called they had a data bank with

15:07.120 --> 15:09.760
saved at that's what makes it stand out

15:09.760 --> 15:11.560
now for me and my

15:11.560 --> 15:13.760
i promise you'd be all

15:13.760 --> 15:15.720
thirty here you say it's going to be

15:15.720 --> 15:18.040
holy pointless because

15:18.040 --> 15:19.320
i mean

15:19.320 --> 15:24.320
you can't wear their kid

15:24.320 --> 15:26.760
uh... pretty good so far

15:26.760 --> 15:28.040
only courses are right

15:28.040 --> 15:29.280
i just don't like them

15:29.280 --> 15:34.280
You just like being able to see them. Like, if I wanted to play Oni, I could.

15:34.280 --> 15:41.280
Yeah, exactly. I want them to be there, maybe have, like, one song unlocked with an Oni, instead of, like, you know, the two last songs.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.280
The songs you want most of all.

15:45.280 --> 15:54.280
Yeah, exactly. I mean, I can't possibly, you know, steal the steps and put them in sim files if, you know, I can't play them. Now can I?

15:54.280 --> 16:00.280
Speaking of which, you want to give a plug for your big contribution to the scene this week?

16:00.280 --> 16:11.280
Yeah, well, I would say I was helping NMR and those people, the crew of people that were supposedly making Max USA sim files,

16:11.280 --> 16:17.280
this crew seemed to have pulled out two files, while myself, in like two days, pulled out eleven files.

16:17.280 --> 16:23.280
Didn't we time you last night? It took you about a half hour to get out, you leave me alone, like all six difficulties, single and double?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
single and double?

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
Yes.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
Singles and doubles, it took me 34 minutes.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
Nice.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
Yeah.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
I think I went to bed before you finished, but hey.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.280
Yeah, it was fun.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.360
I also finished last night, you know, the other five.

16:34.360 --> 16:42.560
So everything's up except for Drop the Bomb, System FS, FX Mint, System SF, SF, yes, like

16:42.560 --> 16:43.560
San Francisco.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Yes.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.560
System San Francisco mix, and the Do It Right.

16:47.560 --> 16:52.280
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

16:52.280 --> 16:56.840
And the Do It Right two-step harmonized mix, or whatever the hell that is, I don't even

16:56.840 --> 16:57.840
know what it's called.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.840
The decent version of Do It Right, basically.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.760
I guess, yeah, whatever.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.760
You like the original?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.760
I like the original.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.760
Why?

17:04.760 --> 17:05.760
I prefer the original.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.880
I like the bass in it better.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.880
I really do.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.880
Alright, fair enough.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.760
I'm entitled to.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.360
You can like whatever you want, Jamie, that's fine.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.320
Except Let Them Move, no one's allowed to like that song except Gwen.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.320
Because I say so.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.320
I'm the chick. Thank you.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.320
Because you're the chick.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
Look, the horn drove off.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
What are you looking at, Loki?

17:28.320 --> 17:29.320
Loki's...

17:29.320 --> 17:30.320
The fly is still...

17:30.320 --> 17:31.320
Oh, he's looking to see the...

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
But the fly, by the way,

17:32.320 --> 17:34.320
which we left twitching on the windowsill,

17:34.320 --> 17:37.320
has managed to slide off and is stuck to the edge of it.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.320
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.320
We have...

17:41.320 --> 17:42.320
Now the fly is actually dead.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.320
There was the fly's last moment on this earth.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.320
See you in hell, fly.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.320
The fly is now splattered against a Propel bottle.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
Dave's back in the room.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.320
Hi, Dave.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.320
What do you want to say about Max USA, Dave?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.320
That's really good.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.320
Dark Black Forest is really cool.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.320
That's right. That's what I do like about Max USA.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.320
This is what they did right.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.320
They didn't just do it right, they did it fucking better than right.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.320
The licensed USA tracks fucking rule.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.320
Dark Black Forest is one of the best Bamani songs ever.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
And I will cut you if you think any different.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.320
He's going to cut you.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.320
And You Leave Me Alone is something...

18:14.320 --> 18:17.320
It sounds like it's right off like a Dance Mania album, but better.

18:17.320 --> 18:21.480
I don't know who thought to license those songs because I certainly never heard them before max USA

18:21.480 --> 18:25.180
I don't know anybody that did know those songs except or Loki you said you thought you'd heard

18:25.720 --> 18:29.400
Dark black forest before or somebody on the show said they heard that before I don't know

18:29.400 --> 18:33.480
I'd never heard it before all right. You know they announced it. It's a very hard song to find

18:33.480 --> 18:39.420
I'm very concerned because the trucker there looks like a guy who walked out with a bag of something and went to the other house

18:40.480 --> 18:43.040
That's probably kale cocaine don't worry about it, okay

18:43.040 --> 18:50.040
But I swear, that's the one thing they did right. Those license tracks rule. I don't know who thought to pick those.

18:50.040 --> 18:58.040
They were cool except for I Like To Move It, which that song sucks! God, I hate that song! I Like To Move It, real to real.

18:58.040 --> 19:03.040
I would like to say that that Move It song, yeah.

19:03.040 --> 19:08.320
No, I just want to say that they could have done better on making the songs harder though,

19:08.320 --> 19:11.320
like Sandstorm, I wanted it to be hard.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.320
It's just like Freezeras, they went overboard on the Freezeras way too much.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.940
Okay, if SCK was here right now, which he's not, so he can't bitch at us whenever we make

19:19.940 --> 19:23.040
fun of Max José, he'd say, that's what edit mode's for.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.680
Yeah, I know, but they went way overboard on the Freezeras.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.840
They're like, hey, we've got a new mode that we can use.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
Let me make you steps.

19:30.840 --> 19:31.840
Yeah.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.720
Sandstorm is a cool song, but they made shitty-ass steps for it.

19:35.720 --> 19:40.720
They need to do the doodle doodle doodle doodle doo, but instead they were like, freeze, freeze,

19:40.720 --> 19:42.320
note, note, note, freeze.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.600
Well, the thing I was disappointed in is there's no new Katas.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
None at all.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.360
Yeah, that was kind of weird that there's no new Katas, but I guess that's to be gentle

19:49.360 --> 19:51.360
to us stupid Americans.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.440
Oh, and- God damn it.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.200
It's the fucking horn again.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.640
And I beat the adrenaline oni for Lucky.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
Pizza.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.640
Maybe it's the pizza guy honking.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.640
I don't know.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.640
Look, he ran to get his pizza.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.840
Then we'll get our pizza and then shoot him.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
Get our pizza and throw it.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.200
We'll pull a Braveheart on him.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.040
We'll throw artichoke hearts at the...

20:11.040 --> 20:12.920
I'm going to eat those.

20:12.920 --> 20:19.960
What do you think about getting old DanceMania tracks that were licensed for Japan and getting

20:19.960 --> 20:21.080
some of those on USA?

20:21.080 --> 20:27.640
I must admit, I thought it was fucking cool that Captain Jack was on Max USA.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.200
and it's just like that was the coolest thing ever. Captain Jack.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.880
I was feeling really crappy when I started playing my game, so I only thumb-bumped it

20:34.880 --> 20:39.260
and didn't get very far into it. But, you know, Brilliant to You, Orchestra Group was

20:39.260 --> 20:44.320
on there, so that made me instantly a happy bunny. And me being the only person who likes

20:44.320 --> 20:50.320
Love That Feelin', I was ecstatic to have that song in the game.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.640
What? Uh-oh.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.280
Dave has just unlocked Do It Right, the two-step harmonizer.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.420
How'd he do it?

20:56.420 --> 21:01.500
you beat the adrenaline, Oni. So guess what? You're going to see a sim file for that on

21:01.500 --> 21:08.020
my site tonight. Alright. Cool. You heard it here first, I guess. Happy, happy, joy,

21:08.020 --> 21:14.540
joy. Did you notice the interesting use of some of the recycled videos, like how Love

21:14.540 --> 21:18.580
This Feelin' has the Let's Groove video in it? I didn't. I don't know if you looked into

21:18.580 --> 21:23.140
it that much. I was just happy it was there. Dan was there and I didn't want to torture

21:23.140 --> 21:30.020
was the multi-genre, multi-tempo song, even though I like it.

21:30.020 --> 21:34.220
Twen says he loves Love This Feelin', and he made me play it on Wednesday's little thing,

21:34.220 --> 21:35.220
which is true.

21:35.220 --> 21:38.020
I don't know what to think about that, because he also likes Let Them Move.

21:38.020 --> 21:43.880
No, I actually, you know, you've got good taste, thank you.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.460
If you were missing it, this is one of the reasons why you want to listen to Orange Lounge,

21:47.460 --> 21:49.200
you know, throughout the week as well.

21:49.200 --> 21:53.560
On Wednesday night when we picked up the game, I came in here and had this elaborate set

21:53.560 --> 21:58.480
up in here and unfortunately Jamie was at home playing it herself and Loki wasn't here.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.080
Jamie was at home sick.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.840
Jamie was at home sick and playing it for yourself but I just got on the stream, fired

22:03.840 --> 22:06.520
up the Orange Lounge stream and just started playing it on air and playing all the new

22:06.520 --> 22:10.640
tracks and stuff so if you listen during the week sometimes you get little surprises like

22:10.640 --> 22:13.080
that so you listen to the Orange Lounge all the time.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.960
I would still like to say that I'm still having an open commission I guess for someone to

22:17.960 --> 22:25.380
make me, you know, dynamite r5. Remember that JB made you that one. I mean... In the way

22:25.380 --> 22:30.380
that you imagined it in your head. A professionally styled mixed one. You didn't like JB's version?

22:30.380 --> 22:36.500
It was special. Thank you JB. It was special. Maybe we'll have to play... It's not quite

22:36.500 --> 22:40.520
the way I envisioned it to be. Didn't we actually play that on a show? No. Oh, then maybe we

22:40.520 --> 22:43.660
ought to play that later. I don't know. I don't even know if I still have it. Hopefully

22:43.660 --> 22:56.460
I do. We'll see. You made JB cry. No, I didn't cry. Oh. No, look. It was good, but it's not

22:56.460 --> 23:02.340
how I envisioned it. I guess you'd have to sort of read my mind. Okay. New one. Okay.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.340
Okay, a new one.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.540
Um, what's a good one that will work?

23:07.540 --> 23:25.860
How about mixing hollick with, um, no, not stoic, mix hollick with, um, um, um, um,

23:25.860 --> 23:26.860
gentle stress.

23:26.860 --> 23:30.380
Hollick doesn't really mix though because it's different measures.

23:30.380 --> 23:59.380
I remember saying on DDR Freak a while back,

23:59.380 --> 24:02.260
Why not just call him Exotic?

24:02.260 --> 24:03.580
And I think somebody ran with that.

24:03.580 --> 24:07.300
I've heard that used again lately, but you know.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
It's all good.

24:08.300 --> 24:12.660
I really would want to see something like Kiss Me or Temple of Love and DDR.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.660
It would be rad.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.380
Well, we've already seen those songs in DDR.

24:15.380 --> 24:21.140
A year and a half before I had even heard of DDR, there was a song that my friend sent

24:21.140 --> 24:25.340
me called Don't Talk Dirty, which was the very first erotic song I ever heard.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.420
And I would like that to be in DDR.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.420
That song owns.

24:28.420 --> 24:29.420
I'll play that later.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.420
We have it.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.420
I do have it.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.420
Okay.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.420
That'd make me a happy bunny.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.420
I need to put lollipop in DDR.

24:35.420 --> 24:36.420
What?

24:36.420 --> 24:37.420
Lollipop!

24:37.420 --> 24:38.420
Lollipop!

24:38.420 --> 24:39.420
No, not that.

24:39.420 --> 24:42.140
No, the DJ Alligator Project lollipop.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.620
Suck on my lollipop.

24:44.620 --> 24:48.020
I wanna lick it.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.100
Last week on Orange Lounge and Honors.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.140
Hey, I'll bring that song.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.660
It's awesome.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.260
Black Lab has announced he'd like to see Dr. Dick in DDR.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.260
Help me, Dr. Tick.

24:59.260 --> 25:01.260
Max, don't have sex with your ex?

25:01.260 --> 25:05.260
Hey, they have the 2003 one, or 2002 version of that.

25:05.260 --> 25:09.260
Yeah, on the new Dance Media Red, or not Red, uh, EX.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.260
Dance Media EX one.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.260
Oh, Dance Media Extreme!

25:13.260 --> 25:15.260
Ooh, zing!

25:15.260 --> 25:20.260
I still fear that, you know, I hope what Dan said doesn't come to pass for DDR.

25:20.260 --> 25:21.260
What's that?

25:21.260 --> 25:28.260
So once they release a series of games and then add Extreme to the end of the most recent release, that means the series is about to die.

25:28.260 --> 25:33.260
But if it's coming, it's gotta be the final, right?

25:33.260 --> 25:45.260
Yeah, it'd have to be like, you know, DDR Extreme Super Duper Extreme Fun Dance Party Final Mix 2, or something like that, I don't know.

25:45.260 --> 25:48.260
I think that DDR Happy Crack makes and they have it all happy hardcore.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.520
but we're ending it now.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.120
Well, could that mean that they're going to be starting over with some new kind of

26:21.120 --> 26:22.560
dance game?

26:22.560 --> 26:25.080
Oh my god, it's 8 panel DDR or something?

26:25.080 --> 26:28.160
You know, DDR2DX?

26:28.160 --> 26:32.280
No, then we'd have Technomotion.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.760
Exactly.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.320
Is the pizza here?

26:37.320 --> 26:39.600
Oh no, it wasn't. Oh, that was a false alarm.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.060
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.500
Dick with the horn.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.500
That sucks.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.500
He hasn't honked in a while, though.

26:46.500 --> 26:52.500
Yeah, but if he does it next week, I swear I'm going to go over there and cut off his hands.

26:52.500 --> 26:57.500
And then if he uses his head, I'll just cut that off, too. And then we'll make him eat it.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.500
Oh, we hear a yes from the other room.

27:00.500 --> 27:06.500
Oh, I wonder what Dave got. Dave might have unlocked something else. We'll see.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.500
I bet he'd be dead.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
Any other thoughts you have on Max Roseanne?

27:10.500 --> 27:17.540
it's pretty and by the way I have to give a big pile you know a big six you

27:17.540 --> 27:22.980
know bar box of kudos to Jason Enos for those funny little yeah oh I completely

27:22.980 --> 27:27.780
forgot about that that is one of the best parts of Max USA is information

27:27.780 --> 27:32.420
mode I laughed my ass off so bad reading some of those I have to I have to see if

27:32.420 --> 27:36.380
I can pull one of them up my friend took a picture one of those so funny those

27:36.380 --> 27:40.140
little information modes that you get whenever what you unlock a new song or

27:40.140 --> 27:43.140
Yeah, whenever you play a song.

27:43.140 --> 27:49.140
Well, some it works with the unlocks, but I think that it's mainly when you actually play the song.

27:49.140 --> 27:53.140
I have to read one of them. It was so hilarious. Let's see if I can find it.

27:53.140 --> 27:56.140
Yes, I do have it, it looks like.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.140
We have one.

27:57.140 --> 28:00.140
Okay, this is for When You Unlock So In Love. It says,

28:00.140 --> 28:07.140
You have unlocked the song So In Love by Caramel S, oozing with stories of love just like melted caramel over a hot flame.

28:07.140 --> 28:12.660
flame this down tempo song has elements of 70s pop smooth jazz and lounge all

28:12.660 --> 28:18.700
rolled into every bite yum that is so cool that was my favorite just that they

28:18.700 --> 28:25.140
have yum that was so cool three little letters add so much they really do is

28:25.140 --> 28:28.460
there another one I have here oh yes this is this is another one that's very

28:28.460 --> 28:31.860
popular I think this is already posted on some message boards but you have

28:31.860 --> 28:35.780
failed game mode for the first time as a result you've unlocked the song

28:35.780 --> 28:41.380
celebrate by JJ company now you can celebrate your first failure in style

28:41.380 --> 28:48.100
but don't give up on your dream to be the ultimate dancer which by the way is

28:48.100 --> 28:55.900
one of the most god-awful songs I've ever heard in DDR oh this is a

28:55.900 --> 29:00.580
information mode when you oh anyway maybe we'll play that later too maybe

29:00.580 --> 29:04.340
I'll play celebrate just to torture everybody no he just beat candy on

29:04.340 --> 29:06.140
on first stage, so I unlocked Candy.

29:06.140 --> 29:06.840
Ah, cool.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.840
Now he's playing home base, the 17 song oni.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.840
Eee!

29:10.840 --> 29:11.840
What do you get when you beat that, though?

29:11.840 --> 29:12.840
Don't you get a...

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
Let's drop the bomb.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.840
No, you get to drop the bomb with 21.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.840
Oh, that's um...

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
Is there anything else you haven't unlocked yet?

29:18.840 --> 29:19.340
Spin the disc.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.840
Oh, spin the disc, that's a good one.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.840
Spin the disc, and the last one's drop the bomb.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.840
I hope it's drop the bomb.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.840
You never know.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.840
Drop the bomb is in this one.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed online.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.840
You have to beat the 21 song oni to get it.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.840
It's really...

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
I mean, it starts off with a three footer

29:33.840 --> 29:39.840
And the hardest song in there is going to be Midnight Blaze, Maniac. That's it.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.840
Tal says that failing an Oni gets you gentle stress.

29:45.840 --> 29:54.840
And that's true. There was a really funny information that says Oni Mode can be so stressful, but smooth out with a sensual song.

29:55.840 --> 30:00.840
Yeah, I remember that one because of course I failed my Oni on the first song because I don't like Onis either.

30:00.840 --> 30:28.840
I am not at all unhappy that the Superstar remix is not there.

30:28.840 --> 30:35.840
I know you hate that remix. What's the one, the M2 step from 6 style? There was an M2 step, I believe that was supposed to be in there too. I wonder what happened to those?

30:35.840 --> 30:37.840
Also, I think More Deep was on there too.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
Maybe, I don't remember.

30:39.840 --> 30:52.840
Let's see what else was supposed to be on there. I don't know. My guess, if anything, since they probably did have some data for those, Max2, that's all.

30:52.840 --> 30:57.840
I think it'll be interesting, maybe somebody can go into the disc and see if they can find images for an emesis and things like that.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.840
I'm surprised nobody's thought to go in and see if those are in there.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.840
I'm sure people have thought of that.

31:02.840 --> 31:10.840
Actually, they're working on it right now. There's a guy that I talked to on DVR maniacs that was doing like hex editing on there.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.840
He was like a cracker at one time, so he's, you know,

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
Cracker!

31:14.840 --> 31:18.200
new new new new new new new new new

31:18.200 --> 31:22.400
ninety he's supposed to go in there to rip uh...

31:22.400 --> 31:27.920
high-quality like backgrounds and the videos

31:27.920 --> 31:30.920
now the court they could find us a consistent somebody going to u s a mix

31:30.920 --> 31:34.000
and actually found like a bad girls background with a hand

31:34.000 --> 31:37.040
things like that is also uh...

31:37.040 --> 31:39.600
uh... aid of uh... game shark

31:39.600 --> 31:43.520
with comics uh... they sound uh... notes that were

31:43.520 --> 31:44.520
in the fourth...

31:44.520 --> 31:46.640
Whoa, because they basically ripped a fourth mix, right?

31:46.640 --> 31:48.280
Yeah, but they found all of those...

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
Challenge mode and things like that.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.440
I was kind of sad that challenge mode didn't make it into Max, but, eh...

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
Challenge mode was evil.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.440
I guess that's kind of...

31:55.440 --> 31:58.440
Well, that's what they kind of called Oni mode, but, eh, that was always fun.

31:58.440 --> 31:59.440
This is a challenging mode.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.440
I just love the picture of Double-T.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.440
I'm not going to cry about it, but, yeah.

32:02.440 --> 32:06.000
And remember, there's STDs in DDR Max.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.080
Did you notice, though, that when you're actually playing the game, that it still has the little

32:09.080 --> 32:11.280
characters, the Asian ones?

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
Yeah.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.280
Crazy, huh?

32:13.280 --> 32:16.860
it's like whoops somebody got lazy and also on the high score screens it says

32:16.860 --> 32:17.760
DDR6

32:17.760 --> 32:22.080
yeah but that's kinda it's kinda so subtle because it kinda goes with the

32:22.080 --> 32:23.000
whole little theme

32:23.000 --> 32:26.560
the modernization theme they had going with that but you don't really notice it

32:26.560 --> 32:27.480
yeah it's still cool

32:27.480 --> 32:30.480
don't get us wrong I'm just glad that you know

32:30.480 --> 32:34.040
they would have had to put it on a DVD for as much crap as they put in there

32:34.040 --> 32:37.400
they did it is on DVD I mean crap in a positive sense you know it was nice crap

32:37.400 --> 32:41.240
you know it fertilizes your

32:41.240 --> 32:48.360
The only other thing that also disappointed me about Max USA is that the back of the box

32:48.360 --> 32:54.520
says something like it links up with Konomics for special stuff, and basically what it means

32:54.520 --> 32:59.840
when you read it in the manual, you can load your edits from Konomics.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.580
You know, it's kind of like, that was such a big disappointment.

33:02.580 --> 33:06.320
I don't think it even should have been, I mean, duh.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.660
You can't even, at least I haven't tried it, but I'm almost positive because the fourth

33:10.660 --> 33:16.660
it's not like you could make an edit with free zeroes and put it into economics, so it's not even really 100% true.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.660
You could, but they just wouldn't show up.

33:19.660 --> 33:28.660
The thing I was kind of laughing at the whole time while playing DDR Max was how much they're advertising for economics in the information screen.

33:28.660 --> 33:34.660
It's just like, go buy. Go buy economics. Go buy. Come on. Go. Go.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.660
Well, Konomics is probably down to 1999 by now, right?

33:38.660 --> 33:40.660
I think most of the PS1 games are.

33:40.660 --> 33:43.660
Last check, Konomics was at $29.99 at GameStop.

33:43.660 --> 33:47.660
I would imagine eventually it'll probably go down to 1999 though, right?

33:47.660 --> 33:49.660
As most of the PS1 games probably will.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.660
Eventually, but it still sells.

33:51.660 --> 33:52.660
Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.660
No question about it.

33:54.660 --> 33:59.660
If you're hooking new people onto DDR, I suppose why not let them know that Konomics is out there?

33:59.660 --> 34:03.460
Of course, they didn't try to sell any copies of USAMIX, but that's okay because USAMIX

34:03.460 --> 34:05.740
was kind of crappy.

34:05.740 --> 34:13.660
It was better than I would have expected for a first release.

34:13.660 --> 34:18.420
Because if you keep in mind, they were testing the waters.

34:18.420 --> 34:24.060
From what I understand, Konami had little faith that DDR was going to be that big as

34:24.060 --> 34:25.060
it is now.

34:25.060 --> 34:30.700
I've noticed each release has been progressively better, so now we have exactly just about

34:30.700 --> 34:31.700
the same product.

34:31.700 --> 34:34.180
We have a better one that was released in Japan.

34:34.180 --> 34:37.460
I agree to an extent about the first mix.

34:37.460 --> 34:42.580
I think they kind of should have already known from success in the arcades, from rabid following

34:42.580 --> 34:44.920
such as DDR Freak, things like that.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.980
The fact that import machines are more popular than the U.S. machines, I kind of would have

34:48.980 --> 34:50.740
expected a little bit more faith.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.700
But they really didn't have that much.

34:53.700 --> 34:58.820
the fact of the matter, they didn't. You know, it took convincing. And so, but, you know,

34:58.820 --> 35:02.220
we have it now. Disney Mix, on the other hand, was an improvement

35:02.220 --> 35:06.100
over the Japanese one, I thought. I don't think so.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.220
It was missing some of the good songs. It missed all the songs that I liked.

35:09.220 --> 35:14.800
But it had Maniac Mode and, you know. I really liked playing the oldies. I mean,

35:14.800 --> 35:20.260
I loved playing Mr. Bassman, I loved playing Surfin' USA. I hate the Macarena, though.

35:20.260 --> 35:24.020
I sort of understand, you know, why they couldn't license them though, so, you know, it makes

35:24.020 --> 35:25.020
sense.

35:25.020 --> 35:26.020
They took out fire.

35:26.020 --> 35:27.020
I'm hoping that they do...

35:27.020 --> 35:28.420
Not fire, they took out an electric light parade.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.820
Yeah, they took out the electric light parade, which is weird.

35:31.820 --> 35:36.380
I kind of hope if they do do a Disney Mix 2 that we'll get the catch-up song.

35:36.380 --> 35:37.380
No.

35:37.380 --> 35:38.380
Never.

35:38.380 --> 35:39.380
Never.

35:39.380 --> 35:46.100
And Dance Magic is still that thing that, you know, really should be put into DDR mainstream,

35:46.100 --> 35:47.960
but still hasn't happened yet.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.080
Maybe that's something that we're going to see.

35:50.080 --> 35:54.500
If they truly are starting over with DDR, maybe the next series of DDR will be more

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
competitive.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.200
That's kind of what I'd like to see, maybe a more competitive version of DDR.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.200
I miss battle.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.200
I miss dance battle.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.680
Dance battle from second mix, dance magic.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.560
I actually almost miss couple steps.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.560
Having couple steps.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.680
Second mix was the last one to happen that I understand.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.680
Didn't third?

36:10.680 --> 36:11.680
I don't know.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.680
Maybe not.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.040
Well, you can always do couples edits.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.960
But it's not the same.

36:16.960 --> 36:21.760
You know, I miss going up to a DDR machine and having to tell it to do versus.

36:21.760 --> 36:27.060
You know, I remember going up to the 1.5 and holding my buttons down so I could play in

36:27.060 --> 36:32.060
versus mode so that we could have the same nifty little steps.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.280
You know, I kind of miss it.

36:34.280 --> 36:41.400
I almost miss having to stomp around and do a code to put in maniac and I miss being totally

36:41.400 --> 36:46.480
messed up when USA came out because I was so used to playing on flat.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.480
Right.

36:47.480 --> 36:48.480
Okay.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.360
Well, we're going to take a real quick break and then we're going to come back and we'll

36:51.360 --> 36:54.180
talk a little bit more about Max USA, we'll talk about some other stuff.

36:54.180 --> 37:00.120
You know, while Max USA has been kind of taking everyone's attention lately, there's been

37:00.120 --> 37:03.220
other news going on too, so we'll get to that.

37:03.220 --> 37:08.680
And a whole lot more, we've got a listless segment for you guys tonight, so do stay tuned

37:08.680 --> 37:15.940
and we will be right back for you guys eventually and we're going to start this off with a song

37:15.940 --> 37:19.300
that we kind of referenced a little bit during this last break later

37:19.300 --> 37:26.300
here.

39:19.300 --> 39:24.300
Give me in your arms and go for my obsession Give me all your passion

39:24.300 --> 39:28.300
Don't talk dirty to me

39:28.300 --> 39:30.300
Oh, touch me

39:30.300 --> 39:33.300
Don't talk dirty to me

39:33.300 --> 39:37.300
Oh, oh baby, touch me

39:37.300 --> 39:56.620
Hey, keep it cool, cause that's the rule I'm your lover babe and not your fool

39:56.620 --> 39:59.820

I'm in love with you, I know it hurts If love is you, so let it work

40:03.340 --> 40:08.340

40:08.340 --> 40:11.340
Touch me with your love And give me satisfaction

40:11.340 --> 40:15.340
When we get into action But don't talk dirty

40:35.340 --> 40:37.340

40:37.340 --> 40:39.340
It's a long, long night

40:41.340 --> 40:43.340
Don't wanna lose

40:43.340 --> 40:44.340
You hate your clothes

40:44.340 --> 40:45.340
Then I'm the one

Tell you babe

40:48.340 --> 40:49.340

We got a day

40:50.340 --> 40:51.340
We got a night

40:51.340 --> 40:52.340
To hold each other

40:52.340 --> 40:53.340
Really tight

40:53.340 --> 40:54.340
When I get loud

Oh, you gotta touch me

41:35.340 --> 41:38.340
Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction

41:38.340 --> 41:40.340
When we get into action

41:40.340 --> 41:42.340
But don't talk dirty

41:42.340 --> 41:45.340

41:53.340 --> 41:57.340

Take me in your arms and go for my obsession

42:00.340 --> 42:05.340
Give me all the fashion, but don't talk dirty to me

Don't talk dirty to me

42:23.340 --> 42:26.340
Oh, oh

42:26.340 --> 42:28.340
Oh

43:26.340 --> 43:55.700
Well go over London Well go over London

43:55.700 --> 44:00.700
Rockover Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio. It's a good place to listen to the music.

44:02.700 --> 44:06.700
That's not going to make sense to anybody unless you were listening that one Friday night.

44:06.700 --> 44:10.700
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

44:10.700 --> 44:11.700
Whee!

44:11.700 --> 44:12.700
Whee!

44:12.700 --> 44:16.700
And we've been talking about Max USA and I believe Dave's in the other room right now trying to get through what?

44:16.700 --> 44:22.700
He's on Homebase, the 17 song oni. He's on song 11 at the moment.

44:22.700 --> 44:32.700
And he's passed all the hard stuff. The only thing that I would be iffy on, because I haven't actually seen him in play yet, is the Do It Right two-step harmonize and the very last one, the Drop The Bomb system FX.

44:32.700 --> 44:34.700
Oh, has he not even played that Do It Right mix yet?

44:34.700 --> 44:35.700
He played it once.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.700
Oh, okay.

44:36.700 --> 44:37.700
And it didn't sound like it was too difficult.

44:37.700 --> 44:39.700
Is Drop The Bomb in that 17 song only?

44:39.700 --> 44:40.700
Yes.

44:40.700 --> 44:43.700
Oh, okay. So you'll have to go watch him play that song, huh?

44:43.700 --> 44:44.700
Yeah.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.700
He can at least get one look at the arrows.

44:46.700 --> 44:51.700
Remember, I can get a pad and paper now.

44:51.700 --> 44:56.580
Exactly. Other things that we could talk about in news this week that you might have missed.

44:56.580 --> 45:01.100
Big news for us locally, we had a tournament Saturday.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.140
Big tournament, huge NorCal tournament this Saturday.

45:04.140 --> 45:07.500
Jamie, you want to talk about this Saturday's tourney?

45:07.500 --> 45:10.660
We are having

45:10.660 --> 45:14.380
Sac de Mani host another fabulous tournament.

45:14.380 --> 45:18.780
It's going to be, the festivities begin at 10 o'clock

45:18.780 --> 45:22.660
at the Scandia on Hillsdale

45:22.660 --> 45:27.180
Hillsdale and I-80, well it's Madison and I-80, if you can find Madison and I-80 you can find

45:27.180 --> 45:28.620
Scandia, it's right off the freeway

45:28.620 --> 45:32.100
registration starts at 10 o'clock right when the place opens

45:32.100 --> 45:36.340
accuracy attack starts at 1115

45:36.340 --> 45:40.580
not perfect attack, accuracy attack, we're having two lines, we are having plenty of

45:40.580 --> 45:41.380
prizes

45:41.380 --> 45:46.260
aren't we? Loki, tell us about everybody who shows up has a chance to win

45:46.260 --> 45:49.380
huge prizes. Tell us about this.

45:49.380 --> 45:54.140
Oh boy. Well, I'm estimating already I'm bringing at least three or

45:54.140 --> 45:58.100
four hundred DVDs, at least, and probably more than that. So...

45:58.100 --> 46:01.340
So why don't we have an opening stipulation for the first, say,

46:01.340 --> 46:06.140
twenty people who pre-register? They get a DVD? Or something, shit.

46:06.140 --> 46:10.740
Oh, there's pizza. Okay, so, um, yeah, as you heard, about

46:10.740 --> 46:14.060
three to four hundred various DVDs that we're gonna be giving away.

46:14.060 --> 46:18.480
Now, we're not going to lie, they're not like cream of the crop type DVDs, but they are

46:18.480 --> 46:19.480
good stuff.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.520
There is great good stuff in there.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.400
It's a lot of anime stuff.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.400
It's not all anime, though.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.580
We know not everybody who's in the DDR is an anime fan, like I don't know shit about

46:27.580 --> 46:28.780
a lot of animes.

46:28.780 --> 46:30.200
But there's some other stuff in there, too.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.240
There's some great sci-fi stuff, and bling bling, and things like that.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.620
Just tons and tons of DVDs are given away.

46:36.620 --> 46:38.520
So just show up, because you might win something.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.600
I mean, there's a very good chance you're going to walk out of there with something.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.520
20 people who end up pre-registering are going to walk away with a DVD as well.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.960
Well, yeah, at least for 20 who pre-register will get a DVD.

46:48.960 --> 46:52.160
Yep, at least. So, it's going to be tons of prizes.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.640
Do we want to talk about what kind of prizes are going to be given away?

46:55.640 --> 46:59.040
Some of the special things that have been donated, or are we going to talk about that later?

46:59.040 --> 47:02.240
Okay, it's going to be secret. You'll find out day of turning, however we are going to make

47:02.240 --> 47:06.200
as Orange Lounge, we're going to be making a donation of a prize.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.280
Yes. The Orange Pack. The Orange Pack will be donated as a prize. Orange Lounge

47:10.280 --> 47:12.080
Radio is going to be donating an Orange Pack.

47:12.080 --> 47:17.080
Yes, we've already bought one of the things for it. It's funny.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.080
Yes, and...

47:18.080 --> 47:19.080
Is that the pizza?

47:19.080 --> 47:23.600
That wasn't the pizza. Oh, okay, cool. We'll take another break pretty soon then. But for

47:23.600 --> 47:29.240
those that cannot make Shaft, because we know that we're an international show at this point,

47:29.240 --> 47:34.000
we have lots of listeners in Japan, hello to you guys, thanks a lot for listening. Canada

47:34.000 --> 47:37.960
as well, got a lot of listeners, eh? And where else do we have a lot of listeners that I've

47:37.960 --> 47:38.960
been noticing?

47:38.960 --> 47:39.960
Australia.

47:39.960 --> 47:40.960
Australia, yes.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.960
Australia, Australia! We love you!

47:42.960 --> 47:45.960
A place I am dying to visit someday. Australia, we have a lot of listeners there.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.960
And all over the globe, thanks to you guys for listening.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.960
If you guys can't be there, that's okay.

47:50.960 --> 47:53.960
We will bring Shaft to your living room.

47:53.960 --> 47:54.960
Yes.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.960
Or your computer room, or wherever you have your computer.

47:56.960 --> 47:57.960
You can get the Shaft.

47:57.960 --> 48:01.960
We are going to be broadcasting live from Shaft all day long.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.960
The stream will start probably before the doors even open.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.960
Sometime at 9 or 10 in the morning.

48:07.960 --> 48:08.960
We might get bored once we have everything set up.

48:08.960 --> 48:10.960
Yeah, we might get bored once everything's set up.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.960
We'll sing a little song.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.960
Loki's going to pretty much be in charge of this,

48:14.960 --> 48:16.960
because Jaime's kind of the queen of the tournament,

48:16.960 --> 48:18.960
so she's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off,

48:18.960 --> 48:19.960
making sure everything's in order.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.960
I'm the Empress, what you talking about?

48:21.960 --> 48:25.960
And I'm going to be kind of emceeing the tournament with my buddy Tal,

48:25.960 --> 48:27.960
going to be up there doing the emcee duties.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.960
So when Tal's doing the emcee stuff, though,

48:29.960 --> 48:31.960
I'll be in the back helping Loki out with interviews,

48:31.960 --> 48:33.960
but pretty much it's all going to be on Loki.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.960
So welcome aboard as co-hosts.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.960
Now do eight hours of radio all by yourself.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.960
Oh yeah. Gotta catch up.

48:40.960 --> 48:46.960
So basically anybody who wants to, as you come off the stage from Perfect Attack,

48:46.960 --> 48:48.960
from Freestyle, whatever...

48:48.960 --> 48:50.960
What? No?

48:50.960 --> 48:51.960
Accuracy Attack.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.960
Sorry, Accuracy Attack. I gotta get in the habit too.

48:53.960 --> 48:54.960
Can you say Perfect Attack?

48:54.960 --> 48:56.960
I'm sorry, this ain't your mama's Perfect Attack.

48:56.960 --> 49:02.960
As they come off the stage from Accuracy Attack, or Freestyle, or A-Team Freestyle...

49:02.960 --> 49:04.960
This so sounded like Cartman.

49:04.960 --> 49:05.960
A-Team.

49:05.960 --> 49:11.960
Okay, whatever. I'm coming to talk about what I want to do, bitch!

49:14.960 --> 49:16.960
Jeez, Carmen!

49:16.960 --> 49:24.960
As you guys finish, you can just walk right into the room. You'll be escorted into the office and get the shit beaten out of you.

49:24.960 --> 49:29.960
No, and you'll be able to be interviewed for as long as you tell all your friends to listen.

49:29.960 --> 49:37.960
And if you are there at the event, you can't listen, that's okay, we'll rebroadcast it probably at least twice on the station at some point.

49:37.960 --> 49:42.960
If I can get it to archive, I can't guarantee it will be rebroadcasted though, we might not be able to get it to archive.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.960
So I've just got to get you guys all to listen on Saturday if you can.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.960
Yep.

49:48.960 --> 49:49.960
Yeah.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.960
Anything else you want- oh, I burped.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.960
Anything else you want to add about Shaft?

49:53.960 --> 49:55.960
That was a brilliant radio.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.960
I'll be there judging.

49:58.960 --> 50:27.960
The address for pre-registration is shaftstaffatyahoo.com.

50:28.960 --> 50:32.960
Make sure that you actually look at the webpage first.

50:32.960 --> 50:35.960
Go to sacbemanani.com

50:35.960 --> 50:42.960
Just go to sacbemanani.com and follow the link.

50:42.960 --> 50:47.960
That is the actual address that the pre-reg information is on.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.960
Of course you can just go to sacbemanani.com

50:50.960 --> 50:53.960
Click the link, click on shaft, and look there too.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.460
But, you know, me, I always like going directly to the site, because that's just me.

50:57.460 --> 51:01.880
But, anyway, go ahead and have a look at it. Make sure, though, that you do not leave any

51:01.880 --> 51:02.880
information out

51:02.880 --> 51:06.720
if you do not know what song you want to do. By the way, the songs

51:06.720 --> 51:10.260
are located under the rules section. Yeah,

51:10.260 --> 51:13.840
accuracy attack songs are up. But make sure that you,

51:13.840 --> 51:16.840
if you don't know what song you want to do, write

51:16.840 --> 51:20.080
TBA to be announced, and you can decide your song day of.

51:20.080 --> 51:25.000
But keep in mind, all qualifying songs will be done in dark reverse.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.320
The reason for this being, we'll go ahead and make an official statement on it.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.640
If you can play going normally, you should be able to play in reverse.

51:32.640 --> 51:36.320
That's a test of your reading.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.060
Dark should not make a difference because that is the test of your rhythm.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.520
We are going for accuracy.

51:40.520 --> 51:44.800
That's kind of a way to, it takes away the blinking of the arrows too, so it makes it

51:44.800 --> 51:49.680
a little bit difficult because I know when IPA, I'm looking at, or AA in this case, I'm

51:49.680 --> 51:55.680
I'm looking at the blink of an arrow a lot of the time to get the tempo, so I would kind of be fucked in that aspect, so it makes it a little more difficult.

51:55.680 --> 51:58.680
This is a judge of accuracy. You know, I would love to see you try to do something in Dark Reverse.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.680
Well, sucks that I'm going to be up there doing, uh, I can't participate because I already know all the songs.

52:02.680 --> 52:09.680
And we're going to be at Scandia before then. I want to see you take the Shaft Challenge.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.680
I think I can handle Shaft.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.680
Let's see if you can get the Shaft.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.680
I think I might like getting, anyway.

52:15.680 --> 52:22.000
Well, is that special?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.660
Also accuracy attack, very game show.

52:24.660 --> 52:30.160
The way we've got the brackets set up, very suspenseful, at least as much as a DDR tournament

52:30.160 --> 52:31.160
can be.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.360
Don't rely on what we've named the categories.

52:33.360 --> 52:37.000
We've got category names are starting to float around out there.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.820
Nobody knows, I say three people I believe, on the planet, literally three people know

52:42.820 --> 52:44.460
what are in those envelopes.

52:44.460 --> 52:48.180
only two of us actually have them written down. Yes, and only two of us actually were

52:48.180 --> 52:55.340
there to write them down. So, Naughty Scandy doesn't know what's in those envelopes? Nope.

52:55.340 --> 53:00.040
The Best Piers Nation don't know what's in those envelopes? They can't be told either.

53:00.040 --> 53:05.780
You can try bribing me. It ain't gonna work. You know, I might let one song out for $100.

53:05.780 --> 53:09.660
I wanted to wear a big sequined jacket to do the MCU. You totally need to do the Rod

53:09.660 --> 53:18.060
We're going to take a really quick break because there's food here and we want to get some

53:18.060 --> 53:22.020
food so we're going to play some Groovilicious 70's tune to get everybody in the mood for

53:22.020 --> 53:27.500
a shaft and then we'll come back and talk some more about some other DDR things going

53:27.500 --> 53:28.500
on.

53:28.500 --> 53:34.920
We hope you guys can tune in on Saturday starting at around 9 to 10 am for the Big Shaft live

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
stream.

53:35.920 --> 53:42.920
Alright, we'll be right back.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.920
Share the price of life

54:09.640 --> 54:11.640
Baby, fight it right

54:12.920 --> 54:14.920
We gonna move tonight

54:16.920 --> 54:18.920
Baby, move tonight

54:20.520 --> 54:22.520
Share the price of life

54:24.240 --> 54:26.240
Baby, fight it right

54:27.720 --> 54:29.720
We gonna move tonight

54:29.720 --> 54:33.720
Ooh, let's just go

54:33.720 --> 54:36.720
Alright

54:36.720 --> 54:40.720
Ooh, let's just go

54:40.720 --> 54:44.720
Stand up, stand up, stand up

54:44.720 --> 54:47.720
Let's just go

54:47.720 --> 54:49.720
Out of the field

54:49.720 --> 54:53.720
Alright, alright, alright

54:53.720 --> 54:55.720
Let's just go

54:55.720 --> 54:56.720
Say you should

54:56.720 --> 55:00.720
Couldn't stand up all right, all right

55:16.720 --> 55:18.720
DJ bring the beat on

55:18.720 --> 55:19.720
Oh, my God.

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
Oh, my God.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.200
Let me go.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.200
Have a map of home.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.200
Have a map of here.

55:30.200 --> 55:31.700
Save a bunch of money.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.700
Get the ones that visit me.

55:33.700 --> 55:41.180
Remember, where we just belong.

55:41.180 --> 55:46.180
Well, that's love

55:49.180 --> 55:51.180
No one's from this world

55:51.180 --> 55:53.180
Down along those lands

55:53.180 --> 55:55.180
She wants the whole band up after me

55:55.180 --> 55:56.180
And she won't be coming back

55:56.180 --> 55:58.180
Well, that's love

55:59.180 --> 56:01.180
Well, would you be right now?

56:01.180 --> 56:15.180
Never go to the base, I'm vomiting, vomiting, vomiting, vomiting

56:15.180 --> 56:19.180
And I'll teach you, let's start rockin' it, rockin' it, rockin' it, rockin' it

56:19.180 --> 56:26.180
Oh, baby, where am I? Where will you be right now?

56:26.180 --> 56:28.180
Tears, and they wanna get the hype up

56:28.180 --> 56:30.180
A couple of MC rocks on the mic, yeah

56:30.180 --> 56:32.180
And here we go, everybody on the line

56:32.180 --> 56:33.180
Ooh, fine, ooh, fine, ooh, ooh, ooh

56:33.180 --> 56:35.180
Well, we're in a low differential

56:35.180 --> 56:37.180
And the sun goes down to green

56:37.180 --> 56:39.180
And this one pushes my mind

56:39.180 --> 56:41.180
Cause I know they're running me

56:41.180 --> 56:43.180
But my love

56:43.180 --> 56:44.180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

56:44.180 --> 56:46.180
Well, won't you be right now?

56:46.180 --> 56:48.180
Not at night now

56:48.180 --> 56:54.180
But my love

57:24.180 --> 57:45.180
Whoa, hello. Sorry gang, that's a bad MP3, so we're gonna just go right into the next song. Sorry about that.

58:24.180 --> 58:29.180
The beat is real Swiss, it's Cuban, barbers here, put it in gear, lean your head, cause the beat is real funky, head

58:29.180 --> 58:33.180
Let's rock and roll with soul, I hold the mic, I go cause barbers in full control

58:33.180 --> 58:37.180
Man, take the game to fame, I'm what I seek for rhyme for rhyme for rhyme, I'll be back later

58:37.180 --> 58:44.180
She's a sexy nigga, she's a ballin' up, she's a ballin' up

58:44.180 --> 58:51.180
She's a sexy nigga, she's a ballin' up, she's a ballin' up

59:21.180 --> 59:46.100
He knew he had to try to let love in Not to let her know, she was in the mood for

59:46.100 --> 59:50.100
So he began to play the game

59:50.100 --> 59:53.100
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

59:53.100 --> 59:57.100
How he was hoping she was not the same

59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.100
Who's to see the kind of lady that I'm seeking

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.100
After all of this time, could this be true love

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.100
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.100
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.100
I like to live where I'm a fine lady

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.100
You've been hard to see so why I am the cure

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.100
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.100
The best day boy you know you can count on me

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.100
Believe me, there's a lady

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.100
You know what she found in me

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.100
Is a lady kind of lady

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.100
That can give you what you need

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.100
Baby, I find ladies that will never leave you lonely

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.100
And maybe there's a lady

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.100
Ladies, find a lady, sign me up, I won't be late

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.100
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:12.100
We were just talking about Sakbamani hosts another fabulous tournament, also known as Shept, which is going to happen this Saturday.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.100
It's pretty soon already now.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.100
Yeah, I know, I can't believe it's already here. Crazy shit.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.100
We also talked previously in the show about DDR Max USA.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:31.100
Rumor is now, I don't know how true this is or not, this is kind of one of those rumors, but maybe you guys have thoughts on this, that Max 2 has already been announced for the US.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.100
What do you guys think? Do you think that's actually possible that it could have already happened or what do you think is going on?

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.100
Nope, it hasn't been announced yet as far as I'm concerned.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:44.100
All that they did was, Max 2 has been announced for the Japanese system, so we know that for a fact.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:50.100
And now where people are getting their information is from gamefacts.com and they said that it's been announced.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:53.100
To be honest, I don't think it's credible at all.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.100
I think, yeah, there probably will be one. No, it hasn't been announced.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.140
You think maybe somebody's getting confused with the earlier announcement that Max 2 is

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140
coming out in Japan?

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.020
No, because they had both listed for Japanese and U.S. systems.

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.020
Interesting.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.020
But who cares?

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.500
I mean, if it comes out, it comes out.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Cool.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.500
Get burned out.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.500
Fucking make onis.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500
Dude, those...

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500
You know what?

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:20.500
I'm feeling the angst in this room.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500
Yes.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.500
I'm thinking it's about time.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500
What?

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500
We're going to do some FUs?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.500
Oh yeah.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Alright, let's do some FUs.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.500
We're going to get into the FUs of the week.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:36.180
the part where Jamie likes to go off and F something. No. I had to go off and say, fuck

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:42.060
them. Fuck them right in their nose, because their ear and their ass aren't good enough.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.460
Alright, and if you want to send your F-us of the week, just send them to me over in

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.560
the chat room. You can PM me over in the chat room, and we already had some people do that,

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.620
or you can alternatively send us an email, but you've got to do it right now, because

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.140
we only do the segment for a little bit orange lounge radio that's all one word

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:03.540
at yahoo.com here we go all right my first one of the week

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.060
um well there's the flies the flies dead there's the asshole with his uh horn and

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:13.860
i hope he dies um i said what mine was going to be in the car didn't i

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:18.020
on the way over here uh license plate yes okay

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:21.380
dan comes home last night proceeds to tell me that our license tag

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.660
our license plate is missing off of our car it's nowhere to be found in the

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:33.260
parking lot and the whole plate around the license plate is missing so we're

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.580
thinking it's either been stolen or has just fallen off although it's kind of

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.420
funny that two screws would fall off at once so this actually might be the

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:44.660
weakest in you know for my man's benefit but he has to spend however many hours

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.740
the DMV tomorrow to get that replaced my poor sweetheart I'm gonna hear about it

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.580
about tomorrow to you

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.920
that's the worst part i have to have your hands at work

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.240
and then go to the dmv

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.160
and they come back and work

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.360
oh my god

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:08.880
there's some days that we don't let my move at all

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.500
uh...

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.640
and that effectively

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.700
goes to

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.660
this cold it seems to be refusing to leave me

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.440
and that

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.360
that's the end of it and then

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.520
all I want to do is sleep. I'm taking a nap. Anyway, um, but yeah. You know, they're not

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:29.520
very big, powerful, evil fuck yous, but they are, so fuck you. All of those things. Yeah,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.080
whatever. But, you know, thank you for pizza.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.960
Is that all your FUs of the Week?

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Mm-hmm. This is fucked up.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.960
Okay. Let's hear from Loki. You got any FUs of the Week?

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.960
I have a new song.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.960
Yes, you do. And yes, I called this actually before the show, so for people that were recommending

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:52.960
recommend during the show. I beat you to it. Well, first nephew of the week goes to Konami

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:03.620
and DDR Max USA. I hate Oni's. Yes, people like Oni's. I don't like Oni's. I don't like

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:09.360
the fact I have to play Oni's to unlock songs. That sucks. You don't have to. Oh yeah, I'll

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.340
just play the game for months on end. Oh, fuck that. I got other games that came out

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:18.340
the same way, like Grand Theft Auto Vice City, they're beckoning my attention, and not playing

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.180
this stupid game constantly. I've double-a'd almost everything on Heavy. I don't need to

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.380
fucking double-a everything in this whole game and still be playing, and songs are still

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:32.980
not unlocked. It's fucked up. Dave just beat, you know, the home base, you know, of course,

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.780
and the new hardcore 21 still hasn't been unlocked, so I guess I gotta play some more

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.060
songs. Oh, really? It didn't unlock hardcore? No, it didn't unlock that at all, so I guess

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:46.880
I got to play about 500 more songs before that fucking thing gets undone, but you got to see the drop the bomb remix finally

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:51.180
Yes, let me add that the drop the bomb remix while the song is cool

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:56.700
The steps suck ass and the backgrounds they took no time whatsoever to make that background

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.700
They're like, let's take the old drop the bomb background and put system

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.300
SF remix on there whoop-de-doo. So that's my complaint

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:12.300
Remember Brilliant To You, when they put out the orchestra groove, they just made it in pink.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:41.500
enough to actually play a 40-minute oni on a homepad.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.100
You'd probably have to go through a couple of homepads while playing. It's like you'd burn out a whole new one

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.460
just from playing that game.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.740
I would feel bad for anybody trying to do that, like not on a controller or

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.740
whatever.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.020
And even on a controller, your frickin' hands are gonna cramp up too.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.120
So, you know, F Konami for their...

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.900
I mean, I like the fact that they put onis in there. That's cool.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:05.820
But what the hell are you thinking putting 21-song onis and 17-song onis? That's just ridiculous.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.820
That's like my 100-minute-long oni.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.820
Okay.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.820
Oh, does Dave have an FU?

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.820
A little bit.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.820
Okay, this is better.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:22.820
So, my FU also goes to Max USA, even though I've just played it, like, half an hour ago.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.820
Also towards the onis, but for different reasons.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.820
I like them, but damn, I've got, like, carpool tunnel now.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.820
Seriously.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:35.820
And it's not just that, it's the fact that the backgrounds are really bright and really flashy.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.820
And so my eyes are really slow.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.820
You can turn that down in the options screen, you know.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.820
I didn't know that after like three minutes, and I'm not going to go start over again.

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.820
Because, you know, to start over I have to play all the other songs again, I'm not going to do that shit.

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:53.820
So, F.U., Oni, on Mac USA.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.820
Alright.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.820
And how do you, how do you unlock Hardcore 21?

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.820
Uh, you have to basically give head to, uh, DDR Max USA.

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.820
That'll be hard.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.820
Alright.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.820
Especially since it doesn't have either.

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.820
Uh, my FUs of the Week.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.820
I have, I have a few, I guess.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.820
Uh, my first FU of the Week goes to Jamie.

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.820
What?

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.820
For getting me addicted to Animal Crossing.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.820
You bitch.

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.820
Now I have to go spend money on a GameCube.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.820
Just so I can have those annoying little assholes move into my neighborhood.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:29.820
Rob lives in my neighborhood.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.820
And an F you to Belle the cow. You bitch, I hate you.

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.820
What did Belle do to you? Belle's the nice one, Petunia's the bitch.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.820
Yeah, an F you to Petunia. She sucks too.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.820
And an F you to Mallory because she won't move out of our town.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.820
However, Rob sent me fruit.

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.820
Yes, I mailed...

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:46.820
He sent me an apple.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.820
I mailed Jamie some fruit and I mailed Dan some fruit.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.820
What you got?

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:52.820
Dan sent you clothes.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:58.160
close. Yes, Dan sent me close. I sent you rags. So, F. Jamie, for getting me hooked

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:05.060
on that crack rock. My other F.U. goes to Psychos. Psychos online that want me to do

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:11.280
dirty things on my webcam. You suck. Go away. I don't like you. Stop messaging me. Stop

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:20.280
mailing me. It's sad. F.U. to stalkers. Now, there's a difference between showing a little

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.280
We like attention, but stalking? No. Stop stalking, please. Sad.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.280
I hate when I get runs in my stalkers.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.280
I think that's all my FUs. I don't think I really have anything else.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.280
Maybe I'll think of something later. Oh, FU to myself for sleeping

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.280
through half of Halloween. And FU

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.280
just like last week, FU to all my friends

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.280
who get drunk while I have to drive. FU. I hate you.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.280
Chat room FUs.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.160
yes they do

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.400
via ps2

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.840
uh... who else has nephew let's see

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.180
black lap says all this is a good one now if you if you hang out in the chat

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.360
room during the week

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.700
in channel pound orange lounge during the week

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.920
you've been hearing uh... about the black lap saga with his roommate

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.440
after his roommate and his now girlfriend for once again getting naughty

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.780
while he was in the room

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.480
they went a bit further this time because moaning was hurting even over

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.520
his headphones and they ignored him when he he threw a bottle at them to get them

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.600
to stop. Yes, that was my suggestion last night in the chatroom, to throw a bottle or

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.460
poke him with the stick. I was going for more of the poking with the stick. Next time, set

01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:02.100
them on fire. See if they notice. He says, F everything that contributed to his inability

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.920
to go to Shaft this Saturday. Instead, he will be paintballing for his birthday and

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.800
he will not be able to listen to the broadcast. Well, that's your choice, buddy. Fuck his

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.460
left side shift keeper sticking so much lately and fuck the fact that I still

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.080

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.560

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:39.320
AOL thing I don't know no and being sick and depressed sucks hard so fuck that

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320
yes it does, I agree.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.320
You know what sucks worse than that?

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.320
Go back to my music for a minute.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320
Oh, okay, yes.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:53.320
Having the flu and PMS at the same time, that sucks more than anything has sucked before.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320
La la la la la la la.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.320
Hey, this is the DJ.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320
I just had to say that.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
Mine topped.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.320
Next.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320
Women in DDR.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.320

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.240
uh... fuck you to me for a consistently changing names in the chat room because

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.520
it was for the back and forth between our sick words guys so

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.560
but that's because i'm not at home

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.920
when r

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.920
Rice Princess, our buddy who's sometimes here during the live shows. I wonder why she's not here tonight. That makes me cry.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:46.920
She says, uh, fuck you to people who bring their babies to the 11pm showing of the movie The Ring last night.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.920
You're hurting your child's ears as well as pissing off everyone who wants to enjoy the movie. Thank you.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.920
Oh, I have something along those lines too.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920
Yes.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920
Where's my music?

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920
You and your music.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.420
back-to-back

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.660

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.380
this woman with you still have that the m s thing going on

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.940
no spoken

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.900
uh...

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.900
could kick your ass girl i'm gonna drop the bomb on your ass

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.220
nah um...

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.540
this little kid makes a mess you know little kids make messes

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.900
this woman comes up and her mom comes up and goes

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.180
oh my god what are you doing in the middle of the damn restaurant oh my god

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.220
and dan and i look over

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.300
and this woman's going off on this girl that can't be more than six years old

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.840
this kid starts bawling

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.080
and was like you clean that up you clean that up

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.100
and the girl goes like i don't wanna

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.820
right in the middle of the damn thing

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:58.240
And finally the woman just takes her out of there, but we're like going and the thing is is that you know

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.440
Who Dan and I are blaming for it is not the little girl

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:06.220
We're planning her mom for being such a bitch. So fuck you whoever you were woman. She didn't look like a bitch, too

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.480
Oh my god. Anyway, isn't that weird when like people just look like a bitch like you can just tell

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.820
People should not breathe. Okay

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.580
Can I get back to the chatroom if you sound okay, please

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:23.580
We have another new person here. Hello to you. It's EOSFVB.

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.580
I guess that's some kind of acronym. I don't know though.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.580
He says, fuck you to AMD for making a 2.7 gigahertz.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:36.580
When I get it, it's going to have this huge heat sink and fan, which is going to make a lot of noise, making him crazy.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.580
And also will exhaust a lot of heat, which will fuck over the whole global warming thing.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.580
Someone who's thinking in the big picture. I like that.

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:46.580
I like the heat. You know, it keeps my room nice and warm in the winter.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.580
You know, I just have to keep my door shut and leave the mirror on.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.580
Hi, you live in California. What happens in the summer?

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.580
Don't run the heater.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.580
I don't really have a choice. Everyone else gets a cold.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.580
I don't get cold. They do.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.580
All right.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:07.580
23rd Magus says, he has a little F.U. to whoever thought that what they were doing was more important than going to Scandi on Halloween.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.580
I have a big F.U. to shitty drivers and being poor.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.580
I also have an F.U. to conundrum 1 for hating DDR. Fuck you, Biatch.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.580
No fighting, no fighting, don't hate, don't hate.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:21.580
On Halloween, Dan and I were taking his dad out to dinner for his birthday, so that was more important.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.580
And I was watching Friends. Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.580
Hey, we were at Red Lobster.

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.580
Hey, IT votes Survivor, okay? I didn't get to watch Survivor till the next day.

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:35.580
And I'm pissed. Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.580
Fuck you to Suu Kyi for voting out Xian. Fuck you.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580
That's all I have to say.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.500
and that means nothing to the rest of us

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:51.500
JB says uh... F you to the little kid at RVGL who likes to grab asses

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.820
alright, let's leave it at that

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.260
uh... Joe Mama

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.980
I think this is a good one to end on, this is the last one, he says

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.380
my fuck you is to school because it sucks

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.700
indeed

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.380
that's why I don't go

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.220
for those that don't know i uh... graduate high school several years i wish

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.300
you were that simple and i'm too old

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:19.140
and he wants to be here if you do the fact that they go to work tomorrow

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.100
have had a whole week off

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.220
yeah if you to work tomorrow because we cannot actually want to go tomorrow

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.100
i had friday off of so nicely sleep until eleven

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:35.640
uh... so i think i was most of my local like nine and what's left

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.340
now that we've gotten this like he's out of the way all i can check the mail

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.180
let's see if we got any over email. I have to give them the courtesy because not everybody

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:47.180
loads the chat room. Nope, no FUs over mail. So fuck you to the listeners for not emailing

01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:53.180
us. No, I'm just kidding. We love listeners. We love you. We love you. We love you. We

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:58.500
love big stickies that leash you. No, wait. What? I don't know. I couldn't think of anything

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:04.900
that rhymed. I brought up in one of the FUs, Survivor, a popular program on CBS. Speaking

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:11.100
of CBS, segue segue, we have the early show finally happening tomorrow from what we're

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:15.740
being told. It's been delayed not once, but twice now. It was supposed to happen on Halloween

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.100
and I had the whole TVO set up to tape it and lo and behold, it didn't even happen because

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:25.720
I guess it rained or something so they couldn't do it. The early show is like CBS's answer

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:30.680
to today, you know the today show? Isn't it like a brand new show? You know Good Morning

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.680
America?

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680
Okay.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.240
It's like, you know, the early news show.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.180
And actually, yes, you're right, Loki.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.920
They just re-tailored the show recently.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.620
They got rid of Brian, well, Brian Gumbel quit, I think, and the other chick got let

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.340
go and they have like a panel, they're, well, I don't know what the hell, but they're turning

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:46.340
it into The View.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.460
It's basically, now it's The Early Show, but it's The View, but with men also.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.140
And by the way, for our listeners who are unfamiliar with my habits of watching TV,

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.140
I don't.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.140
Okay.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.540
Just thought I'd clarify that for you.

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.720
So if somebody brings up a show to me, I'm usually going to go, what's that?

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.000
Or a commercial, I'm going to go, what's that?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.080
The only thing I keep up with is Buffy.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.160
And I haven't watched Buffy since the season started.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.680
But I have to watch Buffy because I need to see James Marsters Naked, okay?

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680
Hello.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680
I need Spike.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.760
Anyway, CBS early show.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.160
It's been delayed but I guess it's finally going to happen Monday, so if you guys are

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.120
up early tomorrow you should watch this provided it doesn't get delayed again

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.720
perhaps I should check some of the big news sites and make sure it didn't get

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.040
delayed again but I guess there's going to be some folks just out there playing

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.600
DDR I'm not sure what they're gonna do I don't know what arcade machine they're

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.920
gonna be playing or anything but it's gonna be nationwide exposure to DDR so a

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.920
bunch of old ladies who get up early in the morning and watch the early show

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.400
will be exposed to DDR won't that be special maybe Julie channel do some

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.920
interviews that'll be exciting wow that was intense that was the best dance

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:06.840
do it Julie Chen should be the announcer in DDR stream Julie Chen you did you

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.800
said you did watch one episode of Big Brother right once okay Julie Chen was

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.400
the host of Big Brother oh she was cool and she's also on the early show so

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.080
that's why I'm like she should do the interview so this never staying up all

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080
I might.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.080
Oops, I did it again on MTV!

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080
Bomani on TV, wow!

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.080
You know what MTV needs to play?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
The Hot Limit video.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.080
Oh my god, that video is so much ass!

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.080
You know what, you know what, we need to set aside the little bit of space and put the Hot Limit video up on the site.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:15.080
I think at some point we're going to need to, because that video is like the fruitiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.080
I'm dancing on a star, I'm dancing on a star, I'm dancing on a star!

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.080
Actually, you can watch it on the Come.2 Music channel.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.080
Oh, is it Come.2 slash ID Music?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.080
That's C-O-M-E, by the way.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
Yeah, you can watch it there.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.080
Just go under the video section.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080
It's TM Revolution, hot minute.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.080
Hot limit, sorry.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:52.080
Oh, I think I got one more F.U. coming in. It's for somebody that I like, Vandalous, and he'll have to P.M. that to me, so send that over and I'll get that F.U. in there before we go to another segment.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.080
Moving along, would you like to do a sim update?

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.080
Actually, I do have one cool thing that I'd like to bring up.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:09.080
While we're bringing up fuck yous and kudos and things like that, I have to say that I got to see a preview of the Metal Gear Solid 2 substance video.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080
I mean commercial that's going to be airing.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
Oh my God, that's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080
What do they do with it?

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.080
It's like a guy in his office, sitting at his desk all of a sudden,

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080
you hear his boss,

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.080
Where's that report?

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080
He goes,

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.080
and then you hear the Metal Gear Solid sneaky music,

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.080
and he's sneaking along the hall,

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.080
and his boss is rampaging,

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.080
his boss looks by,

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.080
and you see this box walks across the office.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080
Does it do the exclamation point thing?

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080
The boss goes into his office,

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.080
and the report is there,

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080
and he picks it up,

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.640
For one of the other Metal Gear games, I don't remember if it was Metal Gear Solid.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.640
He's just going, I don't know. I don't know! The G.A.C.T. commercial was so funny.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.560
I'll make that available somehow. I'll make that available.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.680
G.A.C.T. is the hottest woman. I just have to say, while we're on the topic

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.400
of commercials, the one with Donald Trump and Grimace owns for McDonald's.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.600
Okay, I'm clueless. I know, I'm clueless too. I don't watch enough

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.760
TV. Ever since I got TiVo, I fast-forward through

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.440
commercials. I'm a whore for Tivo. That shit is awesome.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.320
Did you know, I have this theory, and I posted this on DDR for you a while back, that the

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:49.600
McDonaldland characters represent different factions of the franchise. Ronald represents

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:58.440
the company itself, the all-encompassing whole. You have the early bird, who represents breakfast.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:03.680
You have the fry guys, who represent the fries. You've got, you know, Mayor McCheese, who's

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.760
the cheeseburger and Big Mac, the cop, and the hamburglar.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.880
You're not like Ronald isn't the crazy psycho who likes to lure children into his play lands.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:23.880
But you know what? Dan and I have been trying to think of what the grimace representative

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:30.520
we finally realized it. This is what McDonald's wants its consumers to be. Big purple blobby

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520
things.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.960
Is this like trying to compare the Wizard of Oz to the Dust Bowl, that whole thing in

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960
history class?

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960
Is that where you're going with this?

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960
Well, kind of, but no.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:43.360
The other thing is that, you know, the McDonald's franchise wants us all to be dim-witted, slow

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.160
and fat, and live off of their food, where, you know what my impression of the Grimace

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160
is?

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.440
That's the expression you make after eating there.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.740
No, but like, it's Donald Trump and Grimace.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.040
You can't get a better couple.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.960
I mean, that's too cool.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960
Donald Trump.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960
Maybe Ivana and Grimace.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.960
And Grimace.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.640
this is what you get after eating a Taco Bell. I'm making a gift!

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.040
I got Vandalous's F.U. and since we like Vandalous, we'll let him in a little late because we

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.600
didn't get it before. Vandalous says F.U. to politicians for filling his mailbox the

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.240
past week with snail mail spam.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.520
And for all those stupid fucking poster things that are out there. I swear to God, there's

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.840
Oh God, it's like being in high school and seeing all the posters around campus, you

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:31.840
know.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.840
And it's like, hello people!

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.640
No, Jamie, for class president, she rocks!

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.240
It's not the number of posters that wins you the votes.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240
Get a clue.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.520
Oh, is your vote going to be based on something different there, Dave?

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.160
Yeah, I'm going to go around and tabulate how many posters are up, and then I'll vote

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.680
for the person who spent the most time putting them all up.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.440
Thank God you're not 18 and can't vote.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.840
You know what, I remember how that was in high school.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.520
And one year I put up a poster that says, vote for me because I wasn't nominated.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.440
I have a late response to your commercial about the Metal Gear Solid commercial from

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.920
23rd Magus show like this.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.640
The truck have started to move.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.640
Yes!

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.520
Oh my god, I love that.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.400
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.300
All right, we're going to take a really quick break.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.680
We're going to come back, and we're

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.580
going to do a listless segment, everybody's favorite.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.780
And now you can participate through email as well,

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.500
but we like it if you're in the chat room.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.260
Go ahead and join the chat room, any other side IRC server.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:40.500
You can join IRC.acheads.org is your server.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.580
And you can join karma.othersideirc.net.

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.180
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.460
is what you're going to join.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:54.940
And tonight, the list list is going to be a little bit different.

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.140
We decided we're selling out this week since Max USA just came out, and we're going to

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.420
pretty much suck Konami's dick tonight.

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.420
And what we're going to do...

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:08.380
The views expressed by Rob, or not necessarily those views expressed by...

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.380
Yeah, whatever.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:17.940
Uh, pretty much tonight what we're doing, we're doing Best Konami Game, not Bomani.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:22.000
So BES cannot be a game that wasn't Balmaini, we're going to school, or we're possibly going

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to school.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.720
It could be arcade games, it could be damn near anything, so stay tuned, we'll be right

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720
back.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.560
We're going to start this off, we're going to have some old school Beatmania song, and

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.000
a really old school DDR song in this mix, we're going to start it off with one more

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.400
new school Max USA track.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:48.400
This is Do It Right, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.400
And it's you and me to be alright

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.400
So let's do your best and see

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400
You're all that you want

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.400
We'll reach a member and a star tonight

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.400
Come on and let it rest

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.400
And you will never fall

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400
Believe me

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400
You're still the same

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400
Nobody wants to reach back

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
Let it go, let it go

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.400
You're leaving in your sight

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.400
And we're all kinda done

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.400
You're looking back now

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400
Is it alright for you or for you?

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.400
What do you see when you're acting like it's an action scene?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.400
What do you see when we keep it right?

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.400
It's the kind of battle that stands in the lunch room, don't you see his life?

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.400
Even if you don't know, he's a man for you

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.400
He's just like you, yes he's strong

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400
He's the one, tell you what

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.400
So much more to do, get into the world

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400
Well you can knock him off, and take no more

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:05.400
It's the one that can do, so take it easy now

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400
I can show you how

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.400
So still we're love inside, but the rumors say call us to love and light, yeah

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.000
I'm so hypnotized to know the fours and the loosens

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.300
Like magicians, he draws a rabbit out with a hat, son

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.900
I'm doing more like a 44th magnet, MC3's time for collision

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.900
They try to imagine us traveling the street of length

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.600
But everything's supposed to be frightening

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.500
Plus the thought you alone be down in the dimension

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.400
Call the Twilight Zone, you're terrified

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400
Plus you can't bear the blood you and I want to want

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.300
In the land of the lost, we love to sip

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.100
Finish me, my friend, you'll wake up ugly

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.400
Because you're dreaming again, but next time I'm on scene

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.200
Let's try to distance, keep your mouth so soft and dark

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200
Because I'm trippin' dizzy

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.400
I'm hot and shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:22.400
I like to move it, move it, move it

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400
All girls all over the world

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.400
Original man, stunt man for your case man

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.400
I love how all girls move their body

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:46.600
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.880
is brought to you by the letters B, letter A, and the number D9.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:56.320
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.120
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio!

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120
Hi ho!

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:06.120
And as promised, here we go with tonight's List List segment. Yay!

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:14.120
This particular List List is non-beinami konami games.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120
That's right.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:23.120
Whether it be stuff that's been in the arcade, whether it's been in America, whether it was only released in Japan, whether it's super obscure, we're talking about them.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.120
Oh God, I love you! We can press your luck.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.120
No whammies, no whammies, stop!

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.960
or as new school as you want. Dave, your number three choice for best konami, not a bamanigame.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.120
Okay, my number three choice is an arcade game, uh, Police 9-1-1-2.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:14.520
Because that game is cool, and it kind of defeats the purpose of having the game being called 9-1-1-2.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.120
The police!

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.520
If you think about it, the Japanese name was, um, Keisatsu-kan, so, it makes sense.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.020
Yeah! Okay, yeah!

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:27.120
Yes.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.960
Logie, what's your number three choice for Konami thing?

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.400
Alright, um, totally old school arcade game here.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:41.400
It's the Ninja Turtles arcade game. Ninja Turtles. Oh yeah.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:48.400
I used to plug so many quarters in that machine.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.760
I remember one night being at the arcade.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.320
This is, by the way, the same day my brother got hit by a car and was in the hospital.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.320
but anyway these guys paid me to play as Leonardo and we got to the end of the

01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.780
game we had

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.020
freaking uh...

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.480
Craig I can't moving crane

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.720
we had we had shredder beaten in

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.700
the other guy

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.720
and then they turned off the machines

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.900
and let's get a look at it

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.520
bitches

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.320
the only

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.520
multiplayer game that I like more than uh... the Ninja Turtles was the x-men

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.360
six-player game that came on

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.000
I don't think that was Konami though

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I don't think it was Grody.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Well, um, sorry.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Anyway, my, um, number three...

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Jimmy's number three!

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.680
And by the way, I've picked games that I own because I'm cool.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.520
I almost said Grodius II, because everybody knows how much I love Grodius II.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520
Burning Heat?

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.520
Yeah.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.560
Well, instead what I picked for my number three was Kid Dracula on Game Boy, where you

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560
play as Super TV Alucard.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.560
Damn!

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.560
Damn, that's old school!

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:44.560
I...

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.560
And you know, the thing is, is like, if you look on yield fund colland lists, you know

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.560
when they used to have the prices on those pages like that. The game is a $30 game, even

01:35:53.560 --> 01:36:01.560
used. So, it's really hard to find. If anyone can find the game, you can get Moms, though,

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:07.560
for the Famicon. It's the Famicon Mom, online. If no one's ever played it, check it out.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.560
It's hilarious.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.560
Alright. My number three pick is Castlevania II, Simon's Quest. That game was the shit.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.560
Winner.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.560
I like three better.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.560
Fuck you if you don't like that game.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.560
Three was better.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560
Two was the bomb.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:26.560
Because they completely fucked up the first one in the best ways possible.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.560
And the music owned and everything.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.560
So, Castlevania 2 it is.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.560
Dave, your number two pick.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.560
My number two pick is Gradius, the original.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560
This is cool.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.560
From newest of school to oldest of school, Gradius for what, Nintendo, Arcade?

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.560
No arcade. It doesn't matter. I'm not putting systems down. We'll just put Gradius.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.560
Arcade. I don't know. I guess arcade.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:56.560
The reason why I'm specifying systems on mine is because a couple games on here did have variations from system to system.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.560
Eh, we'll be okay, I guess.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560
I guess arcade is sad enough.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.560
All right. So is there any particular reason, Gradius?

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.560
It's cool.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.560
All right, cool.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.560
Loki, number two?

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:17.560
Alright, number two, um, I'm gonna have to go with, uh, Dracula X.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:24.440
Ah, Dracula X, which one, the, the one that they put in, on, on what, TurboGrafx, or what,

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.520
which one, which one, the number, Castlevania V, or what?

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.040
I don't know, it's on PlayStation, I know that.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.640
Alright, okay, that'll work.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.640
Dracula X, okay.

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:36.640
Well...

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.640
No, that was my number one.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.640
Well, that's okay, we have a duplicate, so what?

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.640
Oh, oh, Logie's gonna change it? Okay.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.640
What's that then?

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.640
We'll just go with Metal Gear Solid.

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.640
Metal Gear Solid, okay.

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.640
Switching gears and putting Metal Gear Solid.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.640
Jamie, you're number two big.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.640
Number two, Sexy Parodius for Saturn.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.640
Yes.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.460
sexy proteus

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:10.160
i think let's just say it was a very pretty as the sex prettiest

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.880
kicks its ass cuz you can please

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.440
windy and twin b

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.160
and the guys on paper airplane and uh...

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.800
the little benny girls riding the rockets

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.300
the game is so cool

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.780
and what other game

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.000
can you totally destroy a las vegas showgirl and

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.120
uh... a pirate ship with the kitty cat face on it

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.500
uh... i see in the chat room i see guardian legend being mentioned we

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:38.400
should point out that was made by Irem. That's made by Irem Broderbund, released by Broderbund.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.200
Who were the same people that made Lode Runner, and if you remember Lode Runner, you're cool.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:49.820
My number two pick is Life Force. Life Force is awesome. Salamander series. The honky version

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:54.100
of Gradius II. Well, it wasn't really Gradius II, it was Salamander. Life Force was Salamander.

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:57.540
But they called it Gradius II here, in America at least, didn't they? No. They kind of referred

01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.900
to it. I remember they kind of... The reason why I know this is because I found my Nintendo

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:05.300
the cartridge of it last night.

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.300
For my number one pick, I had Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:13.940
Ah, good pick. I think that would have been on my list if I didn't already know you were

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:14.940
picking that.

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.660
Yeah, I had trouble coming up with some Konami games. But I just really love that game and

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:26.300
the music it's owned. And the fact that you can play as Alucard and I think Richter and

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:27.940
the girl. I forget.

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:32.940
You can only play as Maria on the Saturn version, and the Saturn version had two extra levels.

01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.940
You can play as Maria after you...

01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:37.940
Well, that was a rumor, I think. I don't think it ever really was possible.

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:42.940
The thing about it is that Maria was supposed to be playable on the original, plus they had the other two levels done.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:46.940
If you notice, there's a little trick you can do when you first run into the corridor.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:54.940
If you go back to that first corridor and stomp on this trap door, you can go down the trap door to a save room.

01:39:54.940 --> 01:40:00.940
But that save room leads to the underground garden on the Saturn version.

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.940
So, a little bit of trivia.

01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:04.940
Okay.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.940
Strider is Capcom, we should point out.

01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:13.940
Frogger is Konami game, but I think somebody else put it out and then Konami distributed it.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.940
I'm not sure.

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.940
It's Atari? You sure?

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:17.940
It's Atari.

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:18.940
Alright.

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:19.940
Anyway.

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.940
I just warned that Konami distributed a version of it.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.940
Maybe they were just the distributors of it or something.

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.620
something i don't know anyway who cares you wait out that showed up on the list

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.580
of my uh... again all right you know what

01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.940
uh... lucky you're number one

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.980
foreign but uh...

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.400
i met the contract

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.500
uh... let's go with contras shattered soldier because that's a brand new one

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.240
and

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.260
it's everything conscious should be

01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:46.620
except very very very very hard but i guess part was supposed to be very very

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.300
very very very very

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.940
Alright, yeah, if you didn't do the up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start, then you were fucked anyway.

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.740
Alright.

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:58.460
Well, we already know, but explain it again, okay?

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:02.700
My number one is Dracula X Wando of Blood for the PC Engine Duo.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.420
Game was not released in America. By the way, for all of you who own the Super Nintendo version,

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:09.740
I feel so sorry for you because it's totally butchered.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.500
Um...

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.340
Dracula X Wando of Blood

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:14.620
has the best music ever.

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.320
The best levels ever. This is like...

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:24.720
And I actually, my friend had to pay Dan and I back for an anime expo, so when she was

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:31.360
in Japan she picked this up for us, for ten thousand nine hundred yen.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.120
So it was basically a hundred bucks for this game, and it was worth every penny.

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.720
You can't find it for less than at least two hundred on eBay.

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.720
Wow.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.440
All right, so Drakalex for the PC Engine.

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:48.840
My number one pick, very popular series in Japan, but they didn't do much with it here.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.380
They released a couple games, I think, but I swear I'm naming the American version of

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:56.020
this because this is the one I remember playing as a kid.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.540
This version was the shit.

01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.920
This game is the shit.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
It was awesome.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.180
It had Gradius in it, you might remember, in one little part.

01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.060
It is the Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:06.060
Go, Emon!

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:07.060
Cool.

01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:11.520
Yeah, that was going to be one of mine, but that game rocks.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:15.240
The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was like the best Super Nintendo game they did, maybe

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.400
next to Actraiser, I don't know.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.960
I do have to offer an honorable mention to a series.

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.800
The Konami World series.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.120
Konami World, well...

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:28.680
They were released in Japan, on the Famicom.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.600
They were basically, you play as two generic characters who could go to different Konami

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600
games.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.080
You had a Castlevania world, you had a Gradius world.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.760
It's like Kingdom Hearts Konami.

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:45.280
yeah it was kind of like that but it's it's pretty it's pretty funny

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.120
you know that's also one day probably will have to find the wrong now because

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.960
completely impossible find out what i think i'm

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.100
kona kona all you know i'll be

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.960
one of the one of the one of the one on me

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.400
all right

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.600
here's the list that we have so far now we're gonna do the elimination round i

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.520
gotta say

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:07.340
this could be fucking tough tonight to do the elimination all because all

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:09.240
these games are really do rule

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.900
This is going to be very difficult.

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:16.340
We have Police 911 Part 2, Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, Kid Dracula, Castlevania II Simon's

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:22.540
Quest, Gradius Arcade, Metal Gear Solid, Sexy Proteus, Life Force slash Salamander, Castlevania

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:28.320
Symphony of the Night, Contra Shattered Soldier, Dracula X the PC Engine version, and the Legend

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.740
of the Mystical Ninja.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:31.260
Shit, this is hard.

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.780
Okay, but you get to start it off, Dave.

01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.380
Which one's coming off the list?

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:42.380
Oh, this is really hard because a third of these games, or half, I've never even played

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:48.440
or heard of because they're really random and I don't know that many odd games.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.660
So I think that I'll take off Castlevania II Simon's Quest because if there is a Castlevania

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:57.800
game it should be Symphony of the Night because that's better.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.800
You're a dick.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.140
I still live for Castlevania III or Super Castlevania IV.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:06.340
Anyway, Loki.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:12.220
I'm just never really a fan of a game where the bullets travel like 20 miles an hour,

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:16.980
so I'm going to have to take off police 9-1-1-2 because bullets are supposed to travel at

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:22.980
bullet speed and not at fly, you know, slow paper airplane speed.

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:24.580
That's the one I was going to eliminate, damn you.

01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:29.500
Did you not mention, did you forget to, like, remember that you're Superman, you're faster

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:33.780
than a speeding bullet. So everything moves like slow motion.

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:38.860
Bullet time. Jamie, your turn.

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:43.220
Life Force is so freaking hard. You know, I'm thinking about, I have memories attached

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:48.020
to all of these games. That's the sad thing. And I have to leave Life Force on there just

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:52.460
because even though that game is harder than hell, it's awesome. You know, Symphony of

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:58.100
the Night is awesome even though, of course, the Saturn version is great. Contra has the

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:02.060
the turtle with the fetus ass.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:07.300
I never really played the Goemon game, so I had to give it a boot.

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.300
You are a bitch.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.300
I'm sorry!

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:11.300
You know, I really, really didn't play it.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.980
I'm just being picked on tonight.

01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:19.420
I've always wanted to, but because I have no experience attached to that game, I'm taking

01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:20.420
it out.

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:24.940
Alright, well, that's okay, because I can get a little revenge, because this one was

01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.900
my next pick to go off the list.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:32.520
So my apologies to Jamie, but Kid Dracula, come on, Game Boy, I just don't have much

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.520
sentiment attached to that game, and as Dave mentioned earlier, if you're going to have

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.760
a Castlevania game on the list, it needs to be Symphony of the Night, or Dracula X is

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.360
a good choice too, but not Kid Dracula.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.480
But cheap yellow card with a spiky Dragon Ball hair.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.440
I played it once, I played it once, and didn't need to play it again.

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.440
So sorry, Jamie.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.200
And when you hit them, they go poom!

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:54.200
I was considering Contra Shattered Soldier, but I don't know.

01:45:54.200 --> 01:46:00.600
game is, is, I don't know, disgustingly beautiful. Alright. Uh, Ninja Turtles, okay, so here's

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.960
that was really weak uh...

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:42.960
And Gradius you could only have two options but I think the Nintendo ones you could have at least three if not four, but there was a version that you could only have two.

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.000
So maybe it was the Game Boy one.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.880
Life Force was two!

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.860
Maybe it was the Game Boy one, or Life Force.

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:47.560
Life Force was two.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.220
Ok, maybe that's it.

01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.920
And in Gradius I know for a fact that in Gradius you could have four.

01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:59.920
You know why I bet that would make sense? Because in Life Force you could have two people on screen at the same time which you couldn't really have any for the other Gradius games.

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:03.480
If you add four options a piece, you can basically be blown up the whole screen at once, so that

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480
makes a little sense.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.480
So I think you're right.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480
Look at that flicker.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.480
I think Gradius I, you could have four, Lifers, you could have two.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.520
Maybe we'll just pull up the ROMs after the show and have a look, okay?

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:14.520
We'll settle that.

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:15.520
Go to my house and plug them in.

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.560
Yeah, after the show, we're going to do some more music for you guys.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.480
We going to do the normal playlist, or you want to do an all 2DX night, or what do you

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480
think we should do?

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480
Let's be random.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480
Let's be random.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480
All para para.

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.480
No.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.480
Super Eurobeat number one.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.240
Anyway, here we have our winners.

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240
Yes, we have our winners.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.160
Jamie, in third place, what is our third place winner?

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:36.160
Sexy Parodius.

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.160
Yeah.

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.160
Sexy Mama.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:40.160
That game is so freaking cool.

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.680
Like for the reasons I mentioned before, just because I like blowing up a Las Vegas showgirl

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.680
and killing her to death.

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:45.680
Alright.

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.680
Killing her to death!

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.320
Yay, there's redundancy for you.

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.080
Number three, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:54:52.080 --> 01:55:00.800
Or for those of us who imported it, it would be Dracula X2 Nocturne in the Moonlight.

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.280
It was officially in the Dracula X series.

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.800
Which is a travesty.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.280
It should have been number one.

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.680
You people have no taste, but that's fine.

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:08.680
I forgive you.

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:13.200
Number one, drum roll please, Ninja Turtles arcade game.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.200
Whee!

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:16.100
I have such fond memories.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:18.240
By somewhat of a landslide, might I add.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:21.780
My god, it got like what, 65 votes, something like that?

01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.420
a lot for turtles the arcade game but we have people live in which is okay

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:30.740
it's an okay first choice I guess you know but symphony night still should

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.780
have been your number one

01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:35.500
and for that I reprimand all of you in the chat room but I would actually

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:39.060
you know I was so addicted to Symphony of the night when it came out but when the

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:40.420
Saturn version came out

01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:44.420
I blew through the whole game with Maria oh my god she like

01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:48.460
kicks Alucard's ass Maria is so powerful in that game

01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:53.620
There's very few places that she can't get to.

01:55:53.620 --> 01:56:01.340
And then, um, there's also, though, I mean, what?

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.780
I'm just laughing at chat things.

01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.780
Okay.

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:04.780
Oh, yeah, you saw something up on the channel.

01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:05.780
Okay.

01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:08.300
We'll let Jamie finish her thought, and then we'll go on to the other tangent.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:10.860
My thought just got deflated, so you go ahead.

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:11.860
Go on your tangent!

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:12.860
See if I care.

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:17.860
I have my propel to keep me happy.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:24.860
Pardon me while I eat on air, only on the internet.

01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:28.860
Lankystyle and I are on the same team here, we're rooting for Symphony of the Night.

01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.860
You guys are thinking memories instead of gameplay.

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.860
You remember putting a bunch of quarters into the machine?

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:41.860
What other game could you get Castlevania with Metroid style gameplay?

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:42.860
play.

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:43.860
I know.

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:50.780
Hey, you can't forget the cliche Ninja Turtles thing, which had, well, two things really.

01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:55.380
Two, for the pseudo-3D, it had the diagonal walking down part, you know, where you had

01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:59.300
like sort of, you're going towards the camera, but not really.

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:05.380
Then you also had the jet hover skateboard things for no apparent reason.

01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.380
Hmm.

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.860
All right, so whatever, there was always going to be the Turtles people versus the Castlevania

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.860
people.

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.260
was cool and fuck RVGL for getting rid of it.

01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:14.700
Oh yeah, that's right, fuck them.

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.700
I was actually before...

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:17.700
They need a Castlevania arcade game, that'd be neat.

01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:20.620
It was close between Ninja Turtles and the Simpsons arcade game.

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:24.380
The Simpsons arcade game was one I'm surprised didn't make the list, but it's the same engine

01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:27.860
as Turtles, so it's pretty much, I think a lot of people maybe are thinking Simpsons

01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.540
when they vote for TMNT, who knows.

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:33.380
Couple other random notes before we finish out the show here, because it is about that

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:34.380
time.

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:38.740
They're talking about Propel in the chat room right now, Jamie, you'd like this, VidPower

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:42.740
promoting Propel Water, and Black Lab's trying to steal your Propel Water.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:45.740
No, I'll eat his chat cookie.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:50.740
Propel is like, it tastes like Ghetto Kool-Aid, but not.

01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:54.740
Propel, the Orange Lounge choice of drink while playing DDR.

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.740
Another random note.

01:57:56.740 --> 01:58:01.740
A new test version of MaxXtreme, or MaxXtreme, DDRXtreme came out this week,

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:04.740
and apparently Sakura has been removed as the extra stage

01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:06.740
and replaced with another paranoia,

01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:10.140
and Black Lab would like me to take a minute to tease Loki about it.

01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:11.800
Tease, tease, tease!

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:12.800
Your response?

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.680
First off, the machine's not done yet.

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:20.700
So if they've had the song done and completed and it's a Konami original, why wouldn't they

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:21.700
put it in there?

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.540
Hello, there's going to be 200 fucking songs.

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.420
It's going to be in the goddamn machine.

01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:30.520
It might not be an extra stage, no guarantee that it's probably not going to be an extra

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.040
stage because that would be kind of redundant.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.060
You play Max and you play Max again.

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:37.980
So that'd be kind of stupid, but it's going to be in the goddamn machine.

01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:43.940
Revenge, the song's done, it's a konami original.

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:45.580
What more do you need?

01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:48.460
Alright, that's Loki's official response.

01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:51.220
Dave has another random note he wants to bring up before the show's over.

01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:57.500
On a side note, I AAA'd the remember me or remember you, what is it, and nothing.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.460
You obtain the highest dance level.

01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:00.460
That's it.

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.700
No, you don't get shit for AAAing anything, I don't think.

01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.680
I think you get one of the earlier unlocks, something you've already unlocked by playing

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.240
enough songs.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.480
Okay, and one more random note, because I promised you guys I would mention this in

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.980
the chat room, I talked about this at the beginning of the show, somebody asked, when

01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:18.540
is Orange Lounge going three hours?

01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:19.540
We've been discussing this.

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.120
We've been discussing this, and we are going to up the show to three hours, and it's going

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:24.120
to start?

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:25.120
Eventually.

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:26.560
We're going to tell, let's tell them.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.960
We will start that with episode number 20.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:32.080
number twenty will be the first three hour show and that is by the way in two

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:32.880
weeks

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.520
uh... next week we're gonna be just too fucking exhausting after shaft i think

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:37.840
we're gonna have a lot of

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.060
lot of shaft wrap up a lot of interviews a lot out-of-towners next sunday they'll

01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:44.160
be big show but the first three hour show will be into what you watch it

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:48.760
never doing eight-hour show come on

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.480
okay

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.640
and uh... jamie's got something she's talking about the after birth here

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:56.200
yeah after birth will go a little bit old school so i can you know let you

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.080
know about one of the greatest in

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.760
least appreciative systems ever

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.680
all right and uh...

02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.580
have to get some more fun everybody go around and give us your final five

02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:07.260
because i'm still trying to get the show

02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:09.300
uh... in the show wrap-up uh...

02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:12.100
the final five actually fitting get to do it

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:14.740
uh... so i think i a go for it uh...

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:17.220
really not too much going on other than the mac

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:20.560
the air max you say uh... you guys come out thanks to me

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.060
and uh...

02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:24.220
while max i guess

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:31.220
Speaking of Team Wilo, they're gone again. I don't know where they went. It's news to me, so they're just buh-bye.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:40.220
And X-Step Release Candidate 4 is out. It's also probably going to be Version 1, so go check that out if you use it or not.

02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:50.220
And other than that, I'm going to be getting back onto the 2DX projects, so I'll have more of those 2DX sim files coming out for you guys to play on StepMania.

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:52.220
And that's about it.

02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.220
Alright, Dave, any final thoughts?

02:00:56.220 --> 02:01:09.220
Homework blows ass. That's it. Max USA, if anyone knows how to get the Hardcore 21 unlock, tell Rob, or post it, so I can look.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.220
Alright. Jamie, your final thought?

02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:15.220
Besides your random coughing fits?

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:25.220
All of you people, go play Kid Dracula. You'll love me for it. Play Kid Dracula in Konami

02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:32.900
World. Go obscure, because I say so. And drink Propel. And come to Shaft.

02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:41.180
Come to Shaft. My final thought of the night, come to Shaft and I need a date. That's it.

02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:44.580
Stay tuned, we're going to be playing more music for you after the show's over. Stay
