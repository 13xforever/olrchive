01:34.640 --> 01:38.320
Orange Lounge Radio

We are live and this is episode number 21 for November the 24th of 2002.

01:43.960 --> 01:48.320
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most fanky radio station of all things Bimani.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.200
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.200
What's up, my brother?

02:23.200 --> 02:32.200
Also in the studio, say hello too. Is it Jenny's bitch or is it Jamie's bitch? We don't know, but the initials are JB.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.200
That's all you want to say is hello?

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
Moo.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Moo, okay.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.200
We'll be talking to everybody more a bit later.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.200
We're just going to take a really quick break.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.200
Any other opening thoughts from you folks here?

02:47.200 --> 02:52.000
You know, I don't think the parrot noises pick up very well over the radio, actually.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I don't know, though.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I could burn up.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.800
You can hear a little bit of it?

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
I don't know.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
I don't listen to this show.

02:57.800 --> 03:02.040
Oh, we have a brand- oh, oh.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.040
You know what?

03:03.040 --> 03:05.640
Everybody who un-listens at home, give me food.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.640
You want food right now?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.760
What were you craving before the show started?

03:08.760 --> 03:09.860
Artichoke hearts.

03:09.860 --> 03:13.280
I want a pizza with garlic sauce and artichoke hearts.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.280
Is that a PMS thing?

03:15.280 --> 03:22.280
Alright, we'll be right back after this very quick break.

03:45.280 --> 03:52.280
I would like our listeners to know that Robin King falls.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.280
They're big and fluffy

04:22.280 --> 04:40.440
Before we get into the next song, I'd like to make a real quick announcement, kind of

04:40.440 --> 04:41.600
tease our next segment.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.080
Rob was eating balls.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.600
Well, other than that I was eating balls.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.400
I'd like to announce that after these next two songs, when we come back to the next segment,

04:50.400 --> 04:53.740

06:21.200 --> 06:28.200
It opens up one eager eye For boosting it on the sky

06:28.200 --> 06:39.200

06:39.200 --> 07:05.720

08:19.720 --> 08:22.720
It's all over and I'm standing pretty

08:22.720 --> 08:26.720
In this dust I was a city

08:26.720 --> 08:29.720
If I could find a souvenir

08:29.720 --> 08:32.720
Just to prove the world was here

08:32.720 --> 08:35.720
And here is a red balloon

08:35.720 --> 08:40.720
I'll think of you and let it go

09:05.720 --> 09:15.720
It's up to you, she said to me She knew I wanted to be free

09:15.720 --> 09:24.720
And everybody there began to stare As the ladies started crying

09:24.720 --> 09:32.720
Let's hit it like a fake Let's hit it like a fake

09:32.720 --> 09:35.720
The atmosphere of peace and passion

09:35.720 --> 09:39.720
In a free and easy smudge on the carpet

10:05.720 --> 10:35.120
Niko meow Niko meow

10:35.120 --> 10:47.120
That's right. As we promised during the last break it's time for me to stop hiding secrets from everyone here assembled in the room, and all those assembled in the chat room. I need to stop lying to myself about some thing.

11:05.120 --> 11:11.840
I have to admit this live on air I I like something that a lot of people say

11:11.840 --> 11:20.680
I shouldn't like and people are telling me it's wrong that I feel this way and

11:20.680 --> 11:29.920
that I like these kinds of things but I have to say you guys I I just can't get

11:29.920 --> 11:39.920
enough of it. I, I really do like Polteri's tie from Sick Style. There. I said it. Oh

11:39.920 --> 11:50.920
God, I'm so sorry, Mom and Dad. I'm so sorry. I hate her. I wish she would burn in hell.

11:50.920 --> 11:57.920
In fact, it still holds true, okay? You don't know that all Polteri fans are going to burn

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
You're gonna burn in hell. Who are you to judge?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.920
Listen, don't judge me. You don't know me.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.920
I'm still holding a bounty for her dead.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.920
Bring her head to me and you'll be paid with vast riches of the lens.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
You don't know shit.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.920
Ah, there. I feel much better now that I've come out on radio.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.920
I was so... I was so invigorating. Thank you.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.920
Oh yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.920
No, you're not. You're listening to Trainwreck Radio.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.920
Episode 21!

12:30.920 --> 12:32.920
You're listening to all of Politary all the time!

12:32.920 --> 12:34.920
Before your ears bleed.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.920
Actually, because of Jamie's order that she issued last week on the show,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.920
Politary has been banned from the station for an entire year.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.920
That little 30 second clip...

12:44.920 --> 12:45.920
At least for the rest of the year.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
For the rest of the year.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.920
That little 30 second clip that you heard right there is about all you're going to hear.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
And that does make me sad.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
That makes me sad.

12:53.920 --> 12:59.400
because I'm sorry that is the best version of time I will have a cry I'm

12:59.400 --> 13:03.640
gonna go have a cry the beefy you girls can sing better than her no come on oh

13:03.640 --> 13:10.840
come on she cannot hold a key neither can the beef for you which would make

13:10.840 --> 13:17.440
superhero be that much better that's my impression to be for you no you're a

13:17.440 --> 13:21.820
Eurobeat superhero be it's got beef for you and Polteri what more evil do you

13:51.820 --> 13:56.980
and die. You guys are so mean.

13:56.980 --> 14:00.540
No we're not, we're being honest.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.540
Really so.

14:04.540 --> 14:08.420
Let's start the show off tonight in a different kind of way.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.580
Because we usually kind of wait for the end of the show to talk about this but I

14:11.580 --> 14:12.300
thought we'll

14:12.300 --> 14:16.180
switch things around, we'll do this at the beginning. Let's talk about the Sim Update for this week.

14:16.180 --> 14:20.860
I was gonna say, you mean we're not talking about porn right away? No, we gotta say that for later.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.860
Okay, sim update. Well, we can do that.

14:22.860 --> 14:27.860
Let's see, obviously the most prominent thing going on right now is Turnimix 3.

14:27.860 --> 14:33.860
Entries are actually being accepted right now and until December 20th, so get your stuff in there.

14:33.860 --> 14:38.860
No, I actually played Step Mania for the first time outside of your simulator,

14:38.860 --> 14:41.860
because I've played your simulator at various parties that you've been at and you brought it to.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.860
Outside of your simulator, I actually sat down, I downloaded Step Mania,

14:44.860 --> 14:47.860
and I actually played it for the first time in I don't know how long.

14:47.860 --> 14:54.860
And, you know what? It's pretty damn cool. I don't know what I've been missing out on, but, um, okay.

14:54.860 --> 15:02.860
Anyways, um, yeah, actually, uh, one of the things that's gonna be coming up pretty soon in some of the updates for StepMania is, uh, support for BeatMania.

15:02.860 --> 15:10.860
Uh, so that's gonna be good. So you're gonna see support for BeatMania probably soon after will be Dance Maniacs and Poppin' Music.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.860
And they'll be the all-encompassing Bimani Sim.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.860
The word for that? Squeak.

15:15.860 --> 15:23.460
So, look for that soon. Other things that should be noted, visit DDR UK. I mean, they've

15:23.460 --> 15:27.940
got tons of sync sets that they're releasing now. They have pretty much everything. They're

15:27.940 --> 15:32.060
doing some of the older, you know, one through, you know, five mix stuff. So, go check that

15:32.060 --> 15:38.460
out. Also, check out, I believe, in the DDR Maniacs chat room, they're going to be hosting

15:38.460 --> 15:44.260
files. They have one zip that's all of the ManiRuler stuff that you released in 2002.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.980
oh they love us there right if i remember that right

15:47.980 --> 15:49.940
yeah but they love us there uh...

15:49.940 --> 15:50.900
big fans

15:50.900 --> 15:53.260

15:53.260 --> 15:56.460
so it's just a check that out because they've got you know

15:56.460 --> 16:00.900
his all this effort to go to including the unreleased stuff which i have

16:00.900 --> 16:03.020
it's supposed to be in there and what he said

16:03.020 --> 16:05.680

16:09.700 --> 16:13.260

16:13.260 --> 16:17.460
other people my alright alright so um... there's that also out there floating

16:17.460 --> 16:21.220
around somewhere is that the d r extreme skin for uh...

16:21.220 --> 16:22.460
set me as a good

16:22.460 --> 16:23.720
find that somewhere

16:23.720 --> 16:26.500
uh... supposed to be i guess it's out there somewhere it's out there somewhere

16:26.500 --> 16:30.720
i don't know where since the fact that i have but yet remixed three for sure

16:30.720 --> 16:32.560
uh... is going to be

16:32.560 --> 16:35.420
definitely keep your eye on that they've got a bunch categories including one

16:35.420 --> 16:37.420
now they actually pay to get into flight

16:37.420 --> 16:40.140
you know those people are really professional making files

16:40.140 --> 16:41.420
i'm actually

16:41.420 --> 16:43.960
considering entering, I'm not sure yet.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.060
I did, now you saw that I did my very first step file.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.240
Yes. My very first one, you got to see it. You know what's sad?

16:50.240 --> 16:54.580
I mean, let's just put it this way. I have to say your step file is the most synced step file I've ever seen.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.220
Every time I play that I get AAA.

16:57.220 --> 17:01.120
I guess that's a good thing. You know what though? I, I, there was a really nice guide

17:01.120 --> 17:05.400
online and I, I'll have to find it for you guys later in the show because I don't have it up in front of me right now.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.520
Actually, no wait, I think I have the damn thing bookmarked.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.400
Hold on, let me, let me pull up my bookmarks. I think my site, because it was good. So I want to give props to this guy.

17:11.400 --> 17:16.540
Who wrote it because I actually use this to sync it it looks like the guy who wrote it is

17:17.380 --> 17:24.080
Raiden I thought it was always spelled the other way around, but it's the real name is Steven unfred wrote this file

17:24.720 --> 17:29.780
About how to sync a DWI and well actually he's talking about DWI not step mania

17:29.780 --> 17:34.180
But it was very helpful for me to sync this file

17:34.860 --> 17:38.260
That I did so it was you know you had to go in the goldway

17:38.260 --> 17:41.660
you have to count the beats and do a little math, but this thing kind of walks you through

17:41.660 --> 17:45.060
it, the logic and everything, it was very helpful. So props to this guy for writing

17:45.060 --> 17:46.700
the file because that really helped me in syncing that.

17:46.700 --> 17:47.700
Really sync?

17:47.700 --> 17:50.620
Oh yeah, I will copy, yes, for those of you in our chat room, and if you're not in our

17:50.620 --> 17:56.860
chat room, why the hell aren't you? You should get your booty on over to orangelounge.skie.cx

17:56.860 --> 18:01.700
and then just click on chat. And then that will get you in our chat room, and for those

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
in the chat room, I posted the link right there.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.700
And aren't you lucky you're there?

18:04.700 --> 18:05.700
there?

18:05.700 --> 18:11.980
Uh, see, other stuff that's, um, going on right now, um, see, well, it's not really,

18:11.980 --> 18:19.880
I guess, simulator-related, but it is a pretty big thing, um, ddrspot.com is relaunched,

18:19.880 --> 18:23.860
so, uh, you know, we'll definitely go check that out, the site is beautiful.

18:23.860 --> 18:25.780
We'll talk a little more about that stuff later.

18:25.780 --> 18:32.180
uh... and finally

18:32.180 --> 18:35.980
i don't know how to exactly describe this but uh...

like straps, okay? He's got a mohawk and big like

19:04.780 --> 19:08.260
huge lips full of lipstick. Mr. Spanky.

19:08.260 --> 19:12.740
And then you've got the chick, she's in all like leather and stuff with like horns in her hair.

19:12.740 --> 19:17.380
I mean that's some scary shit. I'm trying to find the DDRPC site right now so we can bring it up.

19:17.380 --> 19:23.380
What kind of sick fucks work at Konami of America? That's all I gotta say.

19:23.380 --> 19:27.700
sick people there. I'm trying to find the BDR, sorry guys. There it is, Dance Dance Revolution

19:27.700 --> 19:34.500
product site, and downloads, and character downloads, because that's all they actually

19:34.500 --> 19:41.500
released. They were too lazy to release songs. That's okay. Yeah, Jason Enos and Mr. Spanky.

19:43.100 --> 19:47.980
The white man always smiting out the black man, did you notice that? Well, they also

19:47.980 --> 19:54.980
I also edited set number seven to remove the skull from Robby and put this stupid like...

19:54.980 --> 19:56.980
I don't even know what kind of head it is.

19:56.980 --> 20:03.980
Why did they do that? They have to edit the skull thing, but yet they have Mr. Spanky!

20:03.980 --> 20:08.980
Well, we know where their focus lies in freaking Bondage Freaks.

20:08.980 --> 20:11.980
Because those aren't the first ones that they've released that were Bondage Freaks.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.980
You've got Koby and Nicky look pretty Koby-ish.

20:14.980 --> 20:21.980
But yeah, it's a sad day, but I don't know, what can you do?

20:21.980 --> 20:24.980
Maybe we'll talk to Mr. Spanky later in the program.

20:24.980 --> 20:27.980
Maybe Mr. Spanky can offer us some advice.

20:27.980 --> 20:32.980
I think Mr. Spanky's a big fan of Orange Lounge Radio, actually, from what I hear.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.980
So we'll talk to Mr. Spanky a little bit later.

20:35.980 --> 20:40.980
Maybe Mr. Spanky will just kind of pop in during one of our breaks and offer you all some good advice.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.980
Because lord knows a lot of you nerds out there could use it.

20:43.980 --> 20:51.980
Back on the subject of Tourney Mix 3, Rob's file there, he sent it over to me and I decided to go ahead and do a background for him.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.980
I actually like it. It looks pretty cool. It's very colorful now.

20:54.980 --> 20:55.980
Which one?

20:55.980 --> 20:56.980
The background for your song?

20:56.980 --> 20:59.980
Oh, yes. You did a very excellent job with that background.

20:59.980 --> 21:04.980
I'll actually play the song I did in Etude starting the next break so everybody can hear it.

21:04.980 --> 21:05.980
And I'm still working on it?

21:05.980 --> 21:11.980
Although I'm not entering Tourney Mix 3 with that. I'm still debating if I even want to enter it at all because I'm shy.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.980
Do it anyways, just do it in light if you're going to do it.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.980
I mean, that's cool.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.980
And I'm entering mine in Alien World.

21:17.980 --> 21:20.980
I'm working on the steps, actually, right now.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.980
So, it'll be cool.

21:21.980 --> 21:22.980
Very cool!

21:22.980 --> 21:24.980
Are you looking at something pretty, Jamie?

21:24.980 --> 21:28.980
There was a piece of lint floating in the air next to me.

21:28.980 --> 21:32.980
You really care about the Sim update, don't you?

21:32.980 --> 21:33.980
Um, yeah.

21:33.980 --> 21:34.980
I...

21:34.980 --> 21:35.980
What, the Sims?

21:35.980 --> 21:37.980
Are you talking about Animal Crossing?

21:37.980 --> 21:38.980
No.

21:38.980 --> 21:45.180
Also, I'll be announcing this later on, something that has to do with my sim, and a further

21:45.180 --> 21:50.020
evolution of my sim, we'll get into that later on.

21:50.020 --> 21:56.280
Alright, so, um, sim stuff, yeah, so you are going to be entering tournament mix 3, I'm

21:56.280 --> 22:01.060
debating it, Jamie doesn't really play the sim, so you probably won't be entering tournament

22:01.060 --> 22:02.060
mix 3.

22:02.060 --> 22:07.260
Does that mean that I get to, like, mix stuff up and sit at home?

22:07.260 --> 22:09.260
Yeah, you should enter tournament mix 3.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.260
I don't have time to do any of that.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.260
It does take a long time. I'll say that.

22:13.260 --> 22:15.260
We should do a bunch of DXY edits.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.260
Put another up there and see what people...

22:18.260 --> 22:20.260
Well, you have to do a new song.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.260
You have to make an... Don't you?

22:22.260 --> 22:23.260
Screw that.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.260
You can't do a song that's already existing.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.260
I'll do it off the gachamanota.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.260
No, you could do...

22:27.260 --> 22:29.260
You could do a dance file to Schlagwerk

22:29.260 --> 22:31.260
because nobody's ever done one.

22:31.260 --> 22:32.260
Oh, really?

22:32.260 --> 22:34.260
My bad.

22:34.260 --> 22:36.260
Both the terror and the regular one.

22:36.260 --> 22:43.260
I would pick one of the old Mega Ranger theme songs, if I had to.

22:43.260 --> 22:48.260
Oh, we have a new person in our chat room that says that they also have this ferret.

22:48.260 --> 22:53.260
Brack2000 also owns the infamous ferret that we like to play here on the show.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.260
Jamie likes to stroke it here on the show. I'm sorry, JB?

22:55.260 --> 22:56.260
Bush Baby.

22:56.260 --> 22:57.260
Bush Baby.

22:57.260 --> 23:02.260
It just had a fun time.

23:02.260 --> 23:05.540
Sorry to interrupt, but I thought you'd want to hear that wonderful news that Bush Baby

23:05.540 --> 23:06.540
has a twin.

23:06.540 --> 23:07.540
Yay!

23:07.540 --> 23:08.540
Bush Baby has a twin.

23:08.540 --> 23:09.660
It's Rob, so I just play with it.

23:09.660 --> 23:12.340
It was a present.

23:12.340 --> 23:16.980
I also ended up in somebody's lap here while he was quite drunk.

23:16.980 --> 23:17.980
Oh?

23:17.980 --> 23:18.980
Remember?

23:18.980 --> 23:19.980
Never mind.

23:19.980 --> 23:20.980
What?

23:20.980 --> 23:21.980
No, what?

23:21.980 --> 23:22.980
What?

23:22.980 --> 23:23.980
When...

23:23.980 --> 23:24.980
Oh.

23:24.980 --> 23:28.180
We need to do another drug show.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.180
We really need to.

23:29.180 --> 23:33.480
So we're going to have to pre-tape a show, so I'm thinking we ought to pre-tape a drunk

23:33.480 --> 23:34.480
show at some point.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.480
That sounds like a winner.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.460
That might be a winner, because I'm actually going to be gone the week between Christmas

23:38.460 --> 23:42.200
and New Year's, so we'll probably do some kind of pre-taped drunk show.

23:42.200 --> 23:47.600
What more appropriate time than the holidays to be doing a drunk show?

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
So we'll see.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
We'll see.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
All right.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.600
That's nice, twin.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
Yay.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
Hooray.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.600
You're special.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.600
Yay.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.600
Hooray.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
You're special.

23:57.600 --> 24:03.080
Go shave your hands.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.720
Let's see.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.120
What else should we talk about here?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
Let's talk about...

24:07.120 --> 24:12.200
No, we're not going to talk about Jenny Rom.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.200
Let's talk about...

24:14.200 --> 24:18.360
This kind of goes along with the whole Sim thing, and Loki was alluding to this a little

24:18.360 --> 24:19.360
bit ago.

24:19.360 --> 24:24.840
There's a brand new version of DDR out there that you may not have heard of, because it's

24:24.840 --> 24:26.040
not official.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.080
It's quite a bootleg.

24:28.080 --> 24:34.640
But I know you all out there have always wanted to dance to Britney Spears, and you've always

24:34.640 --> 24:36.760
wanted to dance to Eminem and Christina Aguilera.

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
I feel sorry for you people.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.080
Loki, tell us more about DDR Top Hits.

24:40.080 --> 24:49.080
It's a piece of crap that they, uh, you know, made very, uh, I don't know. They didn't really put much work into it, looks like.

24:49.080 --> 25:01.080
Um, it's basically a hacked fourth mix upgrade that they made, and it's crap. They just replaced the images and replaced the songs. It doesn't even look like they even touched the steps at all, so.

25:01.080 --> 25:05.080
It's a piece of crap. It's got, like, Christina Aguilera in it, Britney Spears.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.080
That makes it a piece of crap instantly.

25:07.080 --> 25:14.440
It's just it's just sad very very sad. I see no doubt. I wonder if that's old-school. No doubt or new-school. I'll doubt. What do you think?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.880
I don't know who knows who cares

25:19.720 --> 25:21.720
It's just it's crap

25:21.760 --> 25:26.400
It's what they now on the actual website ddrtop hits.com

25:26.800 --> 25:32.160
You can actually see they have screenshots there, and if you look really closely on one of them where it shows a song

25:32.160 --> 25:38.480
The song selection screen, you'll actually see one of the songs, I believe it's Boyz

25:38.480 --> 25:44.280
by Britney Spears, it says 1234007 as the actual song title, because they're dumbasses

25:44.280 --> 25:50.760
and don't know actually how to hack the stupid thing.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.360
And it also has the dance mania banner, might I add.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.120
So doesn't this look like a bad Photoshop job to anybody else?

25:57.120 --> 26:02.200
No, actually, that's what I was alluding to earlier.

26:02.200 --> 26:09.640
I was talking with our fellow DDR Tech guy, Keith, down at Scandia, and they were actually

26:09.640 --> 26:14.960
talking about upgrading their 4th mix to this piece of shit.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.340
So I talked them out of it, and I was like, I thought, hell no.

26:20.340 --> 26:26.520
So what we're going to do, and actually next week, Keith is making me copies of the Flashrom,

26:26.520 --> 26:32.060
the game CD and the install CD and I'm going to hack a Max 2 machine and we're going to

26:32.060 --> 26:35.000
make my own custom mix in the arcade.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
That would be good.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.680
Now, how pompous and cocky of you would it be saying that you're going to be able to

26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
accomplish this?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.000
Do you really think you're going to be able to get in there and hack all the data?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.340
Why hasn't it been done yet?

26:45.340 --> 26:47.360
If it's possible to do, why hasn't somebody else done it yet?

26:47.360 --> 26:48.400
Why haven't the Japs done it?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.320
The Japs always do it first.

26:50.320 --> 26:54.940
Well, for one over here in America, all these machines are illegal.

26:54.940 --> 26:58.540
So really, there's nothing they can do about the fact that I hacked a fucking machine.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.140
Well, they can say, oh, this music's not supposed to be on here.

27:01.140 --> 27:02.740
Well, because it's not licensed.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.980
Well, neither is any of the music that's on any of the import machines, so there's nothing

27:05.980 --> 27:06.980
really they can do.

27:06.980 --> 27:07.980
Suck my dick!

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
Exactly.

27:08.980 --> 27:11.220
So there's nothing that they can really do on as far as that.

27:11.220 --> 27:16.220
Now, hacking a machine is slightly complicated, but it can be done.

27:16.220 --> 27:20.540
Now, there's a song you should put on there, Why You Gotta Go and Make Things So Comfy.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.540
No.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.540
Anyways.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.540
But it can be done.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.540
I mean, look right here.

27:24.540 --> 27:48.540
images and music is a piece of cake to do. And the actual game data itself, the actual program, is only like 30 MB. It's all on a flash ROM, a flash card actually, just a normal 32 MB flash card. And it's pretty easy. Plus, he's also having a few friends of his who are crackers and that kind of stuff. Now that I'm not talking about white guys, I'm talking about actually people that crack software.

27:48.540 --> 27:55.420
software. They're going to be doing the same thing. So, no looking at it. I really think

27:55.420 --> 27:59.740
it shouldn't be too hard since my knowledge of making edits and that kind of stuff and

27:59.740 --> 28:03.580
actually working with just reverse engineering all this shit to do it. Sure, it will take

28:03.580 --> 28:09.060
time. I need to actually look at the game CD and stuff to figure out how all the stuff

28:09.060 --> 28:13.180
is stored and that kind of junk, but I think we can do it.

28:13.180 --> 28:14.500
So this is your new project?

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
This is my new project.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.500
Your new time waster?

28:16.500 --> 28:20.100
time waster yes and but at the same time other cool stuff I'll be able to do with

28:20.100 --> 28:24.900
these game CDs that he's given me is rip all the videos for Max 2. Everyone's

28:24.900 --> 28:27.940
been trying to do that ripping the videos off of DDR USA but I'm actually

28:27.940 --> 28:32.380
just gonna rip them off of Max 2. What I'm planning to do is actually reskin

28:32.380 --> 28:37.140
the whole thing just tire redo the whole skin for it so it's gonna look

28:37.140 --> 28:41.540
professional not gonna be this oh look DDR top hits with like a little gradient

28:41.540 --> 28:44.740
background piece of shit that they have on there. And a picture of Britney! And a

28:44.740 --> 28:49.020
a picture of Brittany? No, I'm not going to do that. Reskin the whole backer, everything,

28:49.020 --> 28:53.460
you know, do skins on it, make it all real nice, redo everything. Those steps are going

28:53.460 --> 28:59.020
to be brand new and we were just throwing around a bunch of ideas because actually,

28:59.020 --> 29:02.100
for instance, people would think, okay, there's limitations on what you can put on one of

29:02.100 --> 29:06.340
those things that's all stored on CD. Well, not exactly because you can replace the CD

29:06.340 --> 29:10.220
ROM drives with hard drives and then you can just stick, oh, look, 120 gigs worth of stuff

29:10.220 --> 29:15.660
on there, you can actually have a DDR mix with everything on it. So it can be done.

29:15.660 --> 29:20.820
Loki makes Konami cry. Oh, yeah. Well, see, Konami would be the only one to get pissed

29:20.820 --> 29:24.500
about this stuff, or the RIA, but then all they'd have to do is they'd have to remove

29:24.500 --> 29:29.120
every machine in the United States, which... So you could possibly be fucking it up for

29:29.120 --> 29:34.540
everybody? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hello. I'm fucking it up for everybody. I'm not selling

29:34.540 --> 29:40.140
my fucking mix on the internet for, no, 11, 14... $1,495. Yeah, I'm not selling. This

29:40.140 --> 29:45.260
this is going to be exclusive to scandia okay this is exclusive to scandia

29:45.260 --> 29:48.300
so there's only one so if you're out there listening to me you know exactly

29:48.300 --> 29:51.620
where to come and arrest loki

29:51.620 --> 29:55.260
okay just because i make the thing doesn't mean i'm responsible for it

29:55.260 --> 30:00.100
that's like trying to sue the gun manufacturer for a murder i mean

30:00.100 --> 30:01.820
just because they make it

30:01.820 --> 30:05.700
doesn't mean i'm assuming the risk for actually running it in an actual arcade

30:05.700 --> 30:07.580
this is all scandia so

30:07.580 --> 30:08.520
things go down

30:08.520 --> 30:10.120
they're going down not me

30:10.120 --> 30:14.120
going to ruin DDR, or Loki's going to ruin DDR.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.120
Yeah, but guess what? Another thing is, um, I will be able to get copies of

30:18.120 --> 30:22.120
all these game scenes and stuff. I have, you know, Ox...

30:22.120 --> 30:26.120
I have the hookups, basically, and so right when we get Extreme 2,

30:26.120 --> 30:30.120
same thing with that. So, what I need to figure out now, the really tough thing...

30:30.120 --> 30:34.120
What the hell do I put in it? You should copy your sim over.

30:34.120 --> 30:38.120
That's a lot of shit, no? Screw that.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.120
I will advise you on what songs need to be in there.

31:08.120 --> 31:17.120
Well, but the first step you gotta figure out, you gotta be able to replace, like, at first you gotta go and, like, you start little baby steps. Okay, I'm gonna replace one song. I'm gonna see if I can replace one song.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.120
We need DDR2DX style.

31:19.120 --> 31:26.120
That'd be cool. You need to go, and then, and then he'll go and start ripping the 2DX discs. That'll be his next project.

31:26.120 --> 31:38.120
Well, I mean, it sounds like a major undertaking, but I think if I can pull it off, other than the fact that it'd be, like, really cool because we'd be the only arcade in the United States that have, like, custom mix.

31:38.120 --> 31:46.120
Ah, decent question from the chat room. If you can hack an arcade version, why haven't you hacked a PlayStation version yet? Or a Dreamcast version?

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
Because I haven't even tried.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.120
Oh. That's alright.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.120
I mean, I mean, well, here's the thing.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.120
People have hacked the Dreamcast version, by the way.

31:53.120 --> 32:13.120
The arcade versions are like I said, they are very different. There's a lot of things you can change on an arcade version and you can't there.

32:13.120 --> 32:17.520
going to be a little different too. Sure, I guess we could try hacking a Playstation

32:17.520 --> 32:20.120
version, but I'd rather do the arcade.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.820
The Dreamcast ones will be easier to do though because it's more compatible with the Windows

32:24.820 --> 32:25.820
environment.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.820
Yeah, it's Windows CE.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.800
No, they're not running Windows CE, but they're more compatible. The thing about Dreamcast

32:30.800 --> 32:36.420
games is that they're not running in Windows CE unless they boot up Windows CE at the beginning

32:36.420 --> 32:40.740
of the game, because it's actually loading Windows onto the Dreamcast every time you

32:40.740 --> 32:41.740
boot the game.

32:41.740 --> 32:46.440
Yeah, but I don't know we're gonna look at it. I'll see you know how feasible it is

32:46.440 --> 32:50.160
I'm getting copies of fourth mix stuff and max too, so

32:50.680 --> 32:52.680
We'll go from there

32:52.680 --> 32:58.420
Sounds like fun all I ask you to put on it, please not so quick back in BDR. Don't worry

32:58.420 --> 33:03.240
I was gonna bring back everything including telephone operator cuz I love that song they didn't bring it back so I

33:04.200 --> 33:06.200
Like it just cuz it's a lot like the original

33:06.200 --> 33:12.200
We'll put a bunch of crazy shit in there. All the things that people wanted in there, I'll put in there.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.200
The only problem is though, I'm going to piss a lot of people off with this mix.

33:16.200 --> 33:23.200
I'm not seeing why, but let me just put it this way, a lot of people will be angry at me at the very end of this mix.

33:23.200 --> 33:28.200
Are you okay? Jamie has a medical emergency?

33:28.200 --> 33:34.820
But yeah, that's an idea. I mean, we'll see how hard it is and when I get done with it, you know

33:35.640 --> 33:37.720
We'll see. I think I think it can be done

33:37.720 --> 33:40.500
I don't think it's gonna be too difficult if these idiots can make one

33:40.500 --> 33:45.080
I mean obviously they didn't go into great detail of actually hacking the program and changing

33:45.280 --> 33:47.540
some of it looks like the steps or anything, but

33:48.280 --> 33:50.280
You know never know. It shouldn't be too difficult

33:50.280 --> 34:12.560
What do you guys think about this DDR top hits, your opinions, what makes you want to

34:12.560 --> 34:13.560
throw up?

34:13.560 --> 34:19.280
Personally, I want to play it just once, just to see how bad it is, or maybe they actually

34:19.280 --> 34:22.320
did change the steps and it's somewhat decent.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
I'm just curious.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.680
It's going to suck.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.680
Look at the fucking banner for just the beginning there.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.680
It's like blue.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.760
They probably don't have any artists.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.400
They're probably a bunch of programming nerds.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.400
They have no art people.

34:35.400 --> 34:40.080
They just think they're stupid and don't know jack about they just threw this shit together.

34:40.080 --> 34:44.280
You're thinking if you're going to sell something, at least make it look good, I mean, I don't

34:44.280 --> 34:45.280
know.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.240
I could do a way better job than that, that's all.

34:47.240 --> 34:50.320
Black Lab's calling this DDR Miss Hits.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.280
No, I'll name it something.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.200
It's the Total Request Live version of DDR.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.200
I'm talking about Pop It 2.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.560
Well, seriously, I mean, it's like, okay, what do you want to see in DDR?

34:59.560 --> 35:03.200
Okay, well, you know, people, you know, obviously have said V before, oh, well, the steps for

35:03.200 --> 35:04.200
V suck.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.600
You should just call it DDR that doesn't suck.

35:06.600 --> 35:15.600
No, I was going to call it maybe like, DDR Unauthorized or some shit like that, I don't

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
know.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
Red Band DDR!

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
Porno DDR!

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
No, I guess you can't have that at...

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
DDR XXTREME!

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
DDR XXXTREME!

35:21.600 --> 35:26.600
We'll even put Max the XXXM in there just for the hell of it.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.840
Put like a song called that.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.480
We could put crazy stuff in there.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.480
This DDR sucks.

35:34.480 --> 35:41.480
I don't know. Well, we just have to see how feasible this is.

35:41.480 --> 35:45.000
Can I be the new announcer? Can we hack the announcer voice, too? I want to be the announcer.

35:45.000 --> 35:51.040
Actually, you can. We can hack the announcer voice. I was just thinking about using what's

35:51.040 --> 35:57.720
in there right now. Obviously, we can probably steal the stuff from a solo or whatever.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.040
Warning! This game causes cancer!

36:00.040 --> 36:03.240
We need the squirrel that goes, Whee!

36:03.240 --> 36:09.440
you know what we maybe need to get Jamie to like do the voices because you know

36:09.440 --> 36:14.000
we we haven't had a real like bitch and DDR since the solo nurse so Jamie's just

36:14.000 --> 36:19.200
get up there and go you make Captain Jack cry you've gotten a rhythm I took

36:19.200 --> 36:24.040
like him in a tin can

36:24.040 --> 36:26.080
in your makes you actually

36:26.080 --> 36:27.440
sapling uh...

36:27.440 --> 36:30.880

36:30.880 --> 36:33.640
all your cats makes me wet

36:33.640 --> 36:34.560
max

36:34.560 --> 36:37.040
the porno mix

36:37.040 --> 36:39.360
i do not want to play dvd right here myself

36:39.360 --> 36:43.280
we need a ridge racer announcer we need a replies from a tracer i like that one

36:43.280 --> 36:48.840
you dance like a drug and crack or you are a drug and crack or get out of here

36:48.840 --> 36:56.720
step like a dog pisses bitch better have my money you step like dog piss well

36:56.720 --> 36:59.800
let's just you know what come to think of it I know DCB isn't here I don't see

36:59.800 --> 37:02.400
him in the chat room tonight but we ought to just take out the announcer

37:02.400 --> 37:07.720
just put in Wesley Willis clips welcome over London welcome Chicago nobody's

37:07.720 --> 37:13.080
gonna get that sorry I apologize for killing the topic I where do they get

37:13.080 --> 37:18.360
off charging $1,500 for this each they don't I don't know unless they're

37:18.360 --> 37:20.920
selling full machines, no upgrade is worth that.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.440
We didn't talk about some of the fabulous songs that you can play in DDR Top Hits.

37:24.440 --> 37:28.120
Let's name some of these gems, shall we?

37:28.120 --> 37:32.080
Featuring top US artist Britney Spears with Boyz and Crazy.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.080
Oh, Boyz.

37:33.080 --> 37:38.440
I haven't heard Boyz, but, you know, Crazy, maybe, but those aren't exactly, you know,

37:38.440 --> 37:42.640
let's see, whoops, she did it again, or what was the other one that she did?

37:42.640 --> 37:43.640
Who cares?

37:43.640 --> 37:46.080
Boyz was a song that she played in Goldmember.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.760
Beyonce Knowles, Work It Out.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.200
Isn't that a rather new song?

37:50.200 --> 37:52.960
I thought that song just came out a little while ago, so they've been working on this

37:52.960 --> 37:53.960
right up till right now.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.200
How you let me know, Out of My Head and Fia.

37:56.200 --> 38:02.840
Eminem Without Me, Pink Most Girls, Ricky Martin, Cup O' Life, La Vida Loca, She Bangs.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.600
Now see, the people who worked on this obviously have a Ricky Martin fetish, because there's

38:05.600 --> 38:07.320
more Ricky Martin than anything else in here.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.080
You know, most of the songs on there I've never heard.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.080
Ricky Ma-an.

38:10.080 --> 38:14.560
Cup O' Life sucks, Livin' La Vida Loca's crap, and She Bangs is shit.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.520
Although, don't you want to say that you danced to She Bangs?

38:17.520 --> 38:22.520
Actually, Couple Life and Lavita Loka I have her because I have Samba de Amigo.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.520
Imagine the video for She Bangs.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.520
We'll get the fucking-

38:28.520 --> 38:32.520
Wait, are you gonna make new movies for the Loki mix or whatever?

38:32.520 --> 38:37.520
Actually, I was thinking of putting 2DX videos for some of them in there.

38:37.520 --> 38:42.520
But yeah, we could put random videos, we could have the ferret in there, I don't know.

38:42.520 --> 38:48.280
the fuck we wanted. This is pretty much what we wanted to do. I'm actually surprised that

38:48.280 --> 38:53.840
they're going to go and actually do something. We'll just rob like Captain Jack. Go! Let's

38:53.840 --> 38:59.160
go! Let's go! Let's go! I'm just surprised that they're actually willing to do something

38:59.160 --> 39:03.920
like this. I mean, that's kind of ballsy, I would think, just to say, you know what?

39:03.920 --> 39:09.600
We're just going to put some heck fucking arcade game in our arcade. I don't know if

39:09.600 --> 39:12.960
jason nino saw that

39:12.960 --> 39:17.240
someone your hack makes jason ninos cry

39:17.240 --> 39:20.000
all i gotta say though is if they're gonna fucking punish me just give me a

39:20.000 --> 39:22.760
fucking job at konami seriously

39:22.760 --> 39:25.800
i mean oh is this what the point is minded to say

39:25.800 --> 39:28.400
either you're gonna hire me or i'm gonna fuck you up

39:28.400 --> 39:30.840
this is what this is what it's gonna say is

39:30.840 --> 39:34.400
well if you're gonna take so long to make a fucking you know ddr mix and you

39:34.400 --> 39:38.520
say i'm gonna do it for you and then i'm gonna say hi you suck because my mix

39:38.520 --> 39:43.920
owns all of you and you just suck ass. Oh, look at this. My mix is more popular than

39:43.920 --> 39:50.460
the extreme machine in Scandia. Oh, you suck. That's what's going to end up happening. This

39:50.460 --> 39:53.960
is what people are going, oh, extreme sucks ass. I'm going over here and playing a thousand

39:53.960 --> 39:59.840
songs. Oh, wait. Oh, oh, oh, look. You know, this ace sucks ass on the machine over here.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.300
Let's play the big money ruler, Seth. You have fun.

40:02.300 --> 40:07.080
How about Mr. Spanky Mix? Mr. Spanky. You know, I was thinking, well, if we got DDR

40:07.080 --> 40:12.680
I don't know how hard it would be to convert the characters over from DDRPC, but we could

40:12.680 --> 40:15.480
put Mr. Spanky in training mode, maybe.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.480
Alright.

40:16.480 --> 40:21.360
We'll put a video in the background with him whipping Betty or some, or no, Betty whipping

40:21.360 --> 40:24.800
him because he looks like a bitch.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.800
Nellie with Hotten here.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.680
Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams, Shakira, and many

40:31.680 --> 40:32.680
more.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.840
Mariah Carey, crap right there.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.480
I'm sure it'll be as wonderful as Glitter.

40:37.480 --> 40:43.480
It'll be as wonderful as the DDR 5th Mix Solo also.

40:43.480 --> 40:44.520
All right.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.320
Oh, yes, the DDR 5th Mix Solo.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.080
What the hell was that all about?

40:49.080 --> 40:53.320
Did anybody ever purchase that to see if it worked or anything?

40:53.320 --> 40:56.320
No, but it's probably the same thing.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.560
Laser Force should die.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.000
All right.

41:03.000 --> 41:03.560
Let's see.

41:03.560 --> 41:11.680
They didn't they didn't hack all the songs in this though. They got butterfly. They left him butterfly for whatever reason because butterfly is puppy fun

41:11.680 --> 41:13.200
I guess

41:13.200 --> 41:14.840
All right

41:14.840 --> 41:17.000
We're gonna take a real quick break as promised

41:17.000 --> 41:20.200
I'm gonna play that song that I did my very first step file for because

41:20.760 --> 41:21.960
Yeah

41:21.960 --> 41:25.200
I'm a co-host on this show and I can do things like that when I want and

41:25.600 --> 41:29.000
Then we'll hear some other stuff and we're gonna come back and talk about more fun things

41:29.000 --> 41:32.420
Oh, we have a new game to play tonight. Maybe we'll do that after the break. I don't know. We'll see

41:32.420 --> 41:36.940
We'll see if you guys have been good or not. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We will be

41:36.940 --> 41:39.180
We'll be right back, everybody.

42:06.940 --> 42:26.700
Well, your child may find what's in it, but half of he used to smile again, and once

42:26.700 --> 42:32.060
he leaves the night, he'll turn and turn around, and he'll begin to change, he didn't

42:32.060 --> 42:34.820
I've got energy, didn't think it's strange

42:34.820 --> 42:36.580
But then it got a call

42:36.580 --> 42:38.300
It helped me leap on my feet

42:38.300 --> 42:39.820
It couldn't stay too much

42:39.820 --> 42:41.020
I had a dream

42:41.020 --> 42:43.420
You're like me, don't be too happy

42:43.420 --> 42:46.180
If you get up, it's not to be out of touch

42:46.180 --> 42:48.180
Give it up, give it up, give it up

43:16.180 --> 43:32.180
I got the beat and I ride it I got the beat and I ride it

43:32.180 --> 43:39.180
Rock the party, rock the party, rock the party Higher than higher

43:39.180 --> 43:48.180
I'm burning like a fire Higher and higher

43:48.180 --> 43:52.180
I'm breaking higher

43:52.180 --> 43:55.180
Stop screaming and try to look hard I get my body up, you get that beat hard

43:55.180 --> 43:57.180
I'm a veteran now, which means that I've been

43:57.180 --> 43:59.180
In the game two more, six days, I think I've been

43:59.180 --> 44:00.180
Way back when, I've been putting it down

44:00.180 --> 44:02.180
Asking how long it was the baddest bitch on this side of town

44:02.180 --> 44:04.180
I float like a butterfly, sing like a real

44:04.180 --> 44:06.180
Spectacular woman in my city

44:06.180 --> 44:08.180
I don't propose for never giving it less than the best

44:08.180 --> 44:10.180
Lots of ears in the game, that's your request

44:10.180 --> 44:12.180
You like to rhyme, I can't be there

44:12.180 --> 44:14.180
I can't compete, so I don't care

44:14.180 --> 44:16.180
Why that's me, leave it to me

44:16.180 --> 44:18.180
What a real MC is supposed to be

44:18.180 --> 44:20.180
Fucking me up every time that I drop a fucking bullet baby

44:20.180 --> 44:22.180
I done took the spot, I got the beat

44:22.180 --> 44:26.180
And I rock the party, rock the party, rock the party

44:26.180 --> 44:30.180
Higher and higher

44:30.180 --> 44:34.180
I'm doing it like fire

44:34.180 --> 44:36.180
Higher and higher

44:36.180 --> 44:41.180
I'll take you higher

44:59.180 --> 45:03.180
Stand up, stand up, start your fight, start shutting down

45:03.180 --> 45:05.180
Get up, stand up, start your perception

45:05.180 --> 45:09.180
Get up, stand up, start your perception

45:09.180 --> 45:11.180
Get up, stand up

45:13.180 --> 45:15.180
How you gonna be the attraction

45:15.180 --> 45:19.180
I want you, if you wanna stay to the wall

45:19.180 --> 45:23.180
Ride yourself, a piece of reaction

45:23.180 --> 45:25.180
You got to get out the level, make the big fail

45:25.180 --> 45:27.180
Get out, you know we got to go

45:27.180 --> 45:29.180
Get out the level, dance along down the road

45:29.180 --> 45:31.180
Here we go, here we go

45:31.180 --> 45:36.180
Stand up, stretch up, focus up, show up Get up, stand up

45:37.180 --> 45:44.180
What's with you and there in a corner? Like a window, sitting by yourself in the dark

45:44.180 --> 45:47.180
You don't really wanna be your no-no

45:47.180 --> 45:49.180
Come on now, get up and dance that ass in your pit

45:49.180 --> 45:51.180
And please take a moment to get your feet

45:51.180 --> 45:53.180
And raise your feet to the most there's no beat

45:53.180 --> 45:55.180
That's, that's, that's, that's why, that's why

45:55.180 --> 45:58.180
Get up, stand up, stretch up, focus up, show up

47:28.180 --> 47:57.180
Every time I hear your voice

47:57.180 --> 48:06.180
Baby, every day and every night

48:09.180 --> 48:12.180
Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction

48:12.180 --> 48:15.180
And now here's something we hope you'll really like

48:15.180 --> 48:17.180
Mr. Spanky's Tips of the Week

48:17.180 --> 48:21.180
Hello everybody, this is Mr. Spanky

48:21.180 --> 48:29.580
hope you're enjoying getting to play me in the newest version of DDR PC and now

48:29.580 --> 48:35.700
I'd like to present to everybody out there mr. Spanky tip of the week today

48:35.700 --> 48:41.020
we're gonna talk about planning a masturbation party because everybody

48:41.020 --> 48:46.460
knows that mr. Spanky likes to attend masturbation parties with his friend

48:46.460 --> 48:53.380
Betty. Mr. Spanky would like to remind you that when you're planning a

48:53.380 --> 48:58.820
master basin party, do not forget the latex. You should get several boxes of

48:58.820 --> 49:04.420
latex gloves, as well as a wide variety of condoms, both lubricated and

49:04.420 --> 49:10.980
unlubricated. Also, pick up some dental dams. Even if people keep to themselves,

49:10.980 --> 49:17.900
themselves, the latex can add a new dimension to the fun. If the masturbation gets interactive,

49:17.900 --> 49:24.580
the latex is absolutely necessary to keep things safe. Are you enjoying my masturbation

49:24.580 --> 49:29.580
pimp, Dark Sakura?

49:29.580 --> 49:35.700
Are you enjoying my masturbation pimp, Loki?

49:35.700 --> 49:40.980
I was just checking thank you, I've been a naughty boy this week.

49:40.980 --> 49:46.900
I'd also like to remind you to lube it up, get plenty of water-based lubricants.

49:46.900 --> 49:50.820
You may want to opt for single-use packets rather than big bottles.

49:50.820 --> 49:55.980
It will cost a little more, but it's a lot neater and cleaner, and guests will be happy

49:55.980 --> 50:00.500
to have their own lube supplies.

50:00.500 --> 50:06.300
I'd also like to remind you to cover your furniture and even the floor with sinks, so

50:06.300 --> 50:11.820
that will make people more comfortable and help keep things tidy.

50:11.820 --> 50:17.140
You like to keep things neat when you masturbate, don't you?

50:17.140 --> 50:26.900
Lastly, Mr. Spanky would like to urge you to clean up, because nobody likes a messy

50:26.900 --> 50:36.520
masturbation thing. And we all know that a masturbation party can be quite a mess, especially

50:36.520 --> 50:46.320
if you're masturbating to DVR in the nude. That's really messy. Remember folks, don't

50:46.320 --> 50:53.920
let DVR be your bitch. Remember to use baby wipes, tissues, and paper towels, and they

50:53.920 --> 50:55.920
They should be provided in abundance.

50:57.420 --> 51:00.920
You need to use these things to clean Mr. Spanky's bank.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
Things are bound to get messy,

51:03.920 --> 51:06.920
but having the necessities immediately at hand

51:06.920 --> 51:09.920
can decrease the carnage considerably.

51:10.420 --> 51:14.920
You should also set up several trash cans around the play area.

51:14.920 --> 51:19.920
Line them up with plastic bags for easy and safe disposal.

51:19.920 --> 51:24.920
Remember to take inventory or in sex ways, in case something gets lodged somewhere and you lose them.

51:24.920 --> 51:33.920
Excuse me. Excuse me. Is your name Mr. Spanky? No, I'm Mr. Spanky and these are my tips.

51:33.920 --> 51:40.920
Oh, someone's a little pissed off. Did someone get hamster stuck up their sphincter and just kind of forget about it?

51:40.920 --> 51:51.920
Were you at that party? I didn't see you at that party. Oh, you were one of the masked people, weren't you? Oh, I understand.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.920
Is your name Valencia?

51:55.920 --> 51:58.920
That does it for Mr. Spanky's tips of the week.

51:58.920 --> 52:04.920
Please enjoy me in the new DDR character pack number 9 for DDR PC.

52:04.920 --> 52:08.920
And now, I'm taking you back to that crappy radio show.

53:04.920 --> 53:22.240
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

53:22.240 --> 53:25.640
Well, this time they'll take a man, they'll watch him back

53:25.640 --> 53:29.040
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all

53:29.040 --> 53:32.840
Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, what am I gonna do?

53:32.840 --> 53:34.840
Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom

53:38.240 --> 53:41.540
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

53:41.540 --> 53:43.540
We don't here

53:43.540 --> 53:57.540
Here to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

53:57.540 --> 53:58.540
It's really funny.

53:58.540 --> 54:03.540
They should put the catch-up song in DDR, please look, please, please, please.

54:03.540 --> 54:06.540
Actually, that was one of the songs planned to be in there.

54:06.540 --> 54:07.540
Alright, cool.

54:07.540 --> 54:08.540
Anyway.

54:08.540 --> 54:14.200
It's going to be a long, long, long time before we ever see anything, though, right?

54:14.200 --> 54:19.760
I plan on saying, yeah, at least, at least six months.

54:19.760 --> 54:20.760
At least.

54:20.760 --> 54:21.760
At least.

54:21.760 --> 54:22.760
All right.

54:22.760 --> 54:23.760
Well, we'll be looking forward to that.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.760
We'll see updates as they go.

54:24.760 --> 54:28.920
Anywho, it's funny, the catch-up song, there's another funny story I have about that.

54:28.920 --> 54:33.200
Last night I was out at the club, and the DJ put that on as the very last song and says,

54:33.200 --> 54:37.840
I really hate this song, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.040
And then nobody knew the catch-up dance though.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.640
I wish Dave had been there so he could have done the catch-up dance, because he's the

54:42.640 --> 54:44.040
only person I know that knows it.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.400
I only know this.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.400
Anyway.

54:46.400 --> 54:50.960
That's my catch-up story, thank you.

54:50.960 --> 54:54.520
Chat room is reeling over Mr. Spanky's sex tips.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.320
We had somebody set themselves on fire.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.000
Alright.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.560
So without further ado, I'm going to ask everybody in the chat room right now.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.760
It is that time of the show.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.760
I'm sorry.

55:06.760 --> 55:07.760
It's happy time!

55:37.760 --> 55:47.080
they don't count. Or you can send them to email. You can send them over email to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

55:47.080 --> 55:51.080
And I have to ask Jamie now, do we want the terror mix of Slagwerk or do we want the original?

55:51.080 --> 55:53.600
Let's go for the terror mix. We want the terror mix, so I need to find it. So we're gonna

55:53.600 --> 55:58.600
have a new Fuck You song for Jamie. But it's always going to still be Slagwerk. It will

55:58.600 --> 56:04.520
always be Slagwerk. I will never not use the Tac song. Yes, you'll get Jenny Rom JB, I

56:04.520 --> 56:08.520
Alright, here we go. It's time for the Fuck You's of the Week!

56:11.520 --> 56:13.520
Okay, let's...

56:13.520 --> 56:15.520
Well, we have to go for it.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.520
This is fucked up.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.520
Okay.

56:19.520 --> 56:24.520
The first Fuck You of the Week goes to Walgreens for not having chocolate cupcakes.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.520
Everybody here knows that chocolate cupcakes are my crack food.

56:27.520 --> 56:32.520
Well, they didn't have them. They had chocolate zingers, which I think are becoming my new crack food. Anyway!

56:32.520 --> 56:41.520
So, I'm not as sufficiently wired as I could be, although I almost finished a ball of Propel, which fuck you to Mr. Spanky for making me nearly choke on my Propel, okay?

56:41.520 --> 56:45.520
Um, let's see, I...

56:45.520 --> 56:50.520
Yeah, I think, I think he likes to choke. Yeah, Mr. Spanky, from what I hear, enjoys choking.

56:50.520 --> 56:58.520
Um, another fuck you goes toward, um, the shitty week I had, because I just felt shitty and PMS-y, and that sucked.

56:58.520 --> 57:01.520
That, actually, you know, that was bad.

57:01.520 --> 57:08.520
Um, my other fuck you is a very, very serious fuck you, um, it goes toward drama queens.

57:08.520 --> 57:17.520
Not all drama queens are bad lying to you, but then there's the people who complain about their life and then don't do shit to change it.

57:17.520 --> 57:24.520
If you hate your life, do something about it! If you want change to happen, go make it fucking happen!

57:24.520 --> 57:30.520
You know, it may not be instant, but you don't have a right to bitch unless you start doing something about it, okay?

57:31.520 --> 57:33.520
That's what I want to say about that.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.520
And on a happier note, um...

57:37.520 --> 57:40.520
Do you need to be happy bunny plushies and fuck them for not making me?

57:41.520 --> 57:42.520
I did see a happy bunny doll once.

57:43.520 --> 57:44.520
Somewhere. I don't remember. It was on a hot topic, I think.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.520
Oh, I'm a happy bunny plushie.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.520
Oh, we'll find you one for Christmas.

57:50.520 --> 57:50.520
Alright.

57:50.520 --> 57:54.520
One more thing, Johnny the homicidal maniac is cool.

57:54.520 --> 57:58.520
I'm not getting many fuck yous of the week in the chat room, this is kind of surprising.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.520
I've seen one pop up so far, usually there's like 20.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.520
Just another reminder, send them all on your way.

58:04.520 --> 58:07.520
Unless you're sending them over email, that's fine too.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.520
OrangeLoungeRadio at yahoo.com

58:09.520 --> 58:12.520
They need happy noodle boy flushes.

58:12.520 --> 58:15.520
Moving along, Loki, your fuck yous of the week please.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.520
Oh boy.

58:17.520 --> 58:24.520
Okay, let's begin with that hellhole that we call Sun Splash, or Arviggle for all those.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.520
What did they do this time?

58:26.520 --> 58:29.520
Okay, well I went there two days this week, that was probably mistake number one.

58:29.520 --> 58:33.520
First day I go there, there's some dumbass behind the counter, I want, you know, soda.

58:33.520 --> 58:39.520
You stand there, kind of, you know, dead to the world, so I see the bell, and I press the bell.

58:39.520 --> 58:43.520
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I do that for about two minutes.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.600
And it finally goes, oh, oh, oh, and just sees me there.

58:47.600 --> 58:50.480
So then, I'm like, OK, can I get a large surge?

58:50.480 --> 58:52.640
We don't have surge anymore, so fuck them for not having

58:52.640 --> 58:54.720
surge, and fuck that stupid idiot.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.640
Fuck them for hiring dumbass people.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.120
Why the hell they have dumbass kids working

58:58.120 --> 58:59.720
at this stupid place?

58:59.720 --> 59:00.680
I swear.

59:00.680 --> 59:03.640
And fuck them today for not fucking refilling the machine

59:03.640 --> 59:06.240
fast enough with tickets because I keep kicking ass

59:06.240 --> 59:08.240
at stupid speed demon.

59:08.240 --> 59:13.200
So fuck them for that, and just fuck them for not keeping

59:13.200 --> 59:18.200
the machines up because they suck ass. So I hate them, that's fine. Now the next thing

59:18.200 --> 59:25.200
I have for you before is SQS, also known as Stupid Question Syndrome. These stupid people

59:25.920 --> 59:29.960
out there, they ask you really dumb obvious questions. For instance, when I'm playing

59:29.960 --> 59:34.960
the machine, I have a giant stash of tickets in there. Did you win those from that machine

59:34.960 --> 59:41.960
there? Yeah. That's why they're coming out the machine. That's why there's a big pile

59:41.960 --> 59:47.160
pilot dutch the machine on the floor. I won them for that machine. How did you do that?

59:47.160 --> 59:52.880
Because I won them, you fucking idiot. Also for people to drive below the speed limit.

59:52.880 --> 59:56.360
The speed limit's posted there, so you drive faster than it. It's a goal, you know, you

59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.720
want to achieve better than the speed limit. But these people, they're just like, oh, the

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.500
speed limit. They stay away from it like it's like a fucking leper or something like that,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.880
you know? Just stay away from that piece of shit, and they drive 20 under the speed limit.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.940
like trying to swerve around them and shit. I hate them. I hate slow people. I hate slow

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:22.520
people mentally. I hate slow people in automobiles. May they all die. Fucking A. I swear they

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:29.420
should give me, you know, fucking license to kill. I would save the world. Just eliminate

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:36.420
the fucking weakness of our damn society. Kill the stupid people! Kill them all!

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.420
Yeah, but without stupid people it would give us smart people any kind of meaning.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.420
There has to be a balance.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.420
We'll just lock them up in little pens.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:50.420
Yeah, but right now it's like 9 to 10 or 9 to 1 or something like that, you know?

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.420
You have 9 stupid people and you have 1 smart person.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.420
9 stupid people, 1 smart person.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.420
I'd say we just like drop it down to 3 to 1.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.420
I know something like that.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.420
Yeah, so they all suck. I hate them.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.420
Stupid people are meant to be peons of the smart.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.420
We order them around, they fight our worst for us.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:12.420
Yeah, but then they're stupid, they get in our way, and they annoy me, and they ask me stupid questions, and just...

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.420
I hate them. I hate them all.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.420
They should die.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.420
Fucking die!

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.420
You want all their balls to die.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.420
Yes.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.420
Um, that's, yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.420
F you two fortune cookies and tell me to kill my relatives.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.420
Because, uh, I don't like that. That's not cool.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.020
and uh... yet what you think that it's not

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.480
fortunes are these

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.820
you'll hear a larger

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.240
large sum of money from your relatives

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.320
okay

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.560
who have to die for me

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.720
that's what told me it

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.840
communicate to me

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.640
killed relatives until you find one of our money

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.820
so i guess i've got to do you know

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.720
i got one today is like being

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.480
that wisdom does

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.200
wisdom is rare

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:06.200
I forget what the fucking thing said, but it basically called me uglier stupid, so the fuck that stupid fortune cookie.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200
Listen as rare as Asian beauty.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.200
See, it said I'm stupid! It said I'm stupid! May they die!

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Anyways, that's it.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.200
It didn't say you're stupid, it said you didn't have any common sense.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
SEND THEM STUPID! STUPID!

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200
I think Rob's next.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.400
Yes, I'm next although I don't remember like

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.360
All of my FUs of the week, but I remember my first one my first FU of the week

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.800
I hope you're listening. My first FU of the week goes to Brad

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.160
You jerk

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.660
Yesterday we went to Scandia and we started playing Oni mode and keep in mind

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.680
I haven't played DDR in about three weeks by the way, and I'm like, oh, I'll play Oni mode with Brad and I said Brad

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.360
I'm willing to do any oni in the game except love revenge because I always fail Japan like in five seconds because I can't ever

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.640
Get those gallops. Shut up. Stop laughing at me. Fuck you

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.960
So, of course, what does Brad decide to pick he picks the oni now key featuring Polteri

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.960
I'm going to double this

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.960
I had to listen to this.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.400
So fuck Brad!

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.040
I hate you, I'm just kidding.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.200
I love you Brad!

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.240
But not too much, Irene's watching.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.600
I'd also like to say F you to being tired, because I was really tired at the

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.640
club last night, and that's just not cool to go to a club and feel like you're

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.840
dancing like a zombie. Unless you're at a golf club, then you know, that's what you're supposed to be doing.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.320
I'd like to say F you to not doing a damn thing this week, really, I just kind of

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:42.320

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.200
i would have been at four thirty in the morning i woke up at four four

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.080

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.840
so if you sleep twelve hours because we're waiting for the meeting

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.400

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.520
that's true you get my song and i will process

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.160
if you were up to be here

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160
when i got here and wait half an hour

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.080
oh yes uh... f you to me sleeping in so long that it took me awhile to get jamie

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.280
and look he had to wait out here in the cold in front of my house for half hour

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.960
but i thought i'd have to look at you see probably a barbecue stick up my

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.080
whole house at all

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.120
i thought it's not

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.600
i didn't have to do

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.320
all right

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.800
let's go around the room and

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.640

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:33.640

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.880
you like to see

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.640
was stopped by the road

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.460
there's some of the other road

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:33.460
I must look, and stare, and slow down, and slow everyone else down!

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:38.460
At least it usually clears up in the miles.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.460
Alright, that's it?

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.460
Pretty much.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.460
Alright, cool.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.460
Oh, yes.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.460
Bogey!

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.460
Real quick one.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.460
F used his stupid kid at Sun Splash today that keeps trying to talk to me.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.460
I don't want to talk to him, so I ignore him.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460
I walk around.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460
I don't talk to him.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.460
I don't make eye contact with him.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.460
I wish he would just die.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.460
And stop talking to me!

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.980
trying to talk to me

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.980
if you'd like to be carol saying you gotta be a little louder

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.980
if you do

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.340
sure that's not mister stanky son

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:18.460

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:24.820
all right let's go on to the uh... chat room in email after you shall we

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.820
Good God, Twen, you've got too many FUs. I'm reading some of these.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:34.820
A lot of FUs to Justin for being Jenny Rom's bitch and not his and not sending him Jenny Rom songs.

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.820
FU to people at the arcade literally hanging on the PVP machine. FU to still having dial-up.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.820
FU to Jenny Rom songs being hard to find.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.820
FU to Mr. Spanky, finally someone with his opinions.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:50.820
And FU to no one using the new V host he set up for the chat room.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:07:00.820
FU to... oh no, that's not an FU. That's a happy FU. I don't read happy things on this show, so FU twin.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:08.820
Skyline says FU to germs for making him sick. That does suck. I hate being sick. I was sick a couple weeks ago.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.820
Oh, Black Lab has a few FUs. I better restart the song. This is going to be long.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.820
Fuck that Mr. Spanky thing. I've been internally soiled. I hate you.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.820
Mr. Spanky says you're welcome.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:26.820
Fuck the UCD library for only having one copy of every book, so some of the books I needed weren't in stock.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:34.820
Fuck the drama that my suitemates are getting into with other people, and fuck the MGL- oh, that's not very nice.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:43.820
Well, okay, he says fuck himself because he has two finals and can't go to the MGL tournament on Friday the 13th, I guess.

01:07:43.820 --> 01:08:06.820
darktentorias says, F you for still having the same Vanessa May song for the longest time now.

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.740

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.180

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.420
red-hot in there

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.400
i want to have a chill in there but i think it's a little too fast

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.860
we shall see

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.820

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.860
all right

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.660
Oh, you have another one, Jamie, yes.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:38.940
I'd like you to my Para Para controller for not working, thank you.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.900
vidpower says, F you to viruses, I had a cold all week and I started running a

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.980

I also have a sore throat from it, also F you to the sun

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:51.540

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.500
to see.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:58.140
At least you have a Beatmania 2DX machine in town, F you.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:03.780
slinky says f u to the metreon pads for sticking

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.580

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:24.680
just wanted to point that out

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.420

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.060
Let's see. Oh, he went to the auto show today.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.940
Oh, look, he says that's OK.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.580
Brack 2000 says, F you to lost ketchup for existing.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.340
Yes. If you don't know, they're the ladies that sing the ketchup song.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.820
Basically stole that song from the Sugarhill Gang, by the way.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.460
That's just it's a sample of rapper's delight.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.940
F you to the closest DDR machine being 40 miles away.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Crap, that does suck. I'm sorry.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.940
I have had a cry for you just now.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:06.940
I drove out to Roseville, Bethlehem, 40 miles every week to play DDR, so screw you, I don't care.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.940
But if you wanted to, you could go to Tapioca Express.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.940
Not when I first came out here.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.940
That's right.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.940
That's the USA day.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.940
I first started playing this.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:27.940
23rd Magus says, F you to Afrinova Primeval, which he passed with 1 10th of a bar left. Also F you to Nori Nori Nori for obvious reasons. Oh, that happens to be the song I'm playing right now.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:44.940
It was me and Wanda the first time I passed it, and uh, their name here. I had like half my uh, actually I had, you know how on Fismics they have the little tiny bars that equal the whole bar? I had half of one of those left.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.940
We love the fire, we love the fire

01:11:44.940 --> 01:12:12.220
p0k3smot42o

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.220
stuff

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:18.540
where we change the password

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.900

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.740

you get to look at our crap everyday

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.140
and it's interesting

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.140
Alright.

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.860
F you to Yahoo for sending me spam.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.200
We have spam in our mailbox right now and it looks like I wrote a note to myself in

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.620
there too which I already took care of so I can delete those.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:56.680
So let's open up this email from Dave who isn't here tonight and he sent us an email

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.100
saying I'm not there.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:02.020
He says read this word for word, we'll see.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.640
Well sorry I couldn't be there this week so a big F you to both my parents for taking

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.500
me to Big Sur which blows ass.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500
What is Big Sur?

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500
Waterbed floor.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.500
Okay.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.500
It's on the coast? What do they do there?

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.500
I don't know. I think that's where they have, like, surfing companies.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Okay.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.500
Oh, a surf's up, dude!

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.500
No, when I lived in Alabama, there's a waterbed store called Big Sur Waterbeds.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.500
Wait, Loki, in the mic.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.500
Big Sur's a fucking campground. It's in, like, the coast.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.500
Alright, it's like a forest or some shit like that.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500
We need to take this show to the wilderness!

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:41.500
I've never heard of that place. I always knew of it as being a waterbed store.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:48.500
I was going to drive down past there, but fuck you to the Sacramento Tract, so I had to go to the mountains, and that was cool.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:53.500
Because I had to do that before snow came to the mountains and stuff.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:58.500
Bradley, by the way, is the king of impromptu road trips. The king. I'm sorry, JB?

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:04.500
The name of that one would be where they have a place like, lower or something, where they camp out.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.500
Orange Lounge and Blair Witch Project, thank you.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Fuck, fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck was that, fuck this, fuck that!

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.500
That was basically the Blair Witch Project in ten seconds, thank you.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.220
Bobani chat rooms.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.220
How cute.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.500
I was there last night, and the only person there was Black Lab, so...

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.540
Oh, well, you were there for a second.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.540
You were idling.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.540
I was asleep.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.740
I was downloading stuff.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:17.740
And also, FYI, you can get to the chat room directly through our website.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.740
We have a Java chat.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:22.540
you that just don't have the time to set up M.I.R.C. or don't want to or you're on a work

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:26.140
computer. I don't know why the hell you'd be at work on a Sunday night, but it is Monday

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.140
morning in some countries. You know we don't have Java on my work computer?

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:36.140
I can't run it. Anyway, you can do that directly through our website. Orangelounge.skiu.cx.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:44.700
F you to Jamie for eating my taquitos a while ago. Dude, you left in here, butthole. Okay,

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.340
It's about it, maybe more later.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.980
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was our FUs of the week.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.100
Oh wait, I got one more! I got one more, I'm sorry.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.060
I have to find a special song for this FU too, I'm sorry.

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.260
Just give me one minute here.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.340
Okay.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.740
Here we go.

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:13.260
Sorry, I will take a break right after this FU.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:16.540
FU to Internet Drama from DCB.

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.620
Thank you.

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:23.420
I don't know if you can hear, but we're playing Wesley Willis for you in the background.

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.660
All right,

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.980
because Jamie has to pee, we're going to take a quick break, and we will be right back.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.500
And when we come back,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.980
the Bamani Cage Match, a brand new game

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.380
we're going to play here

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:38.340
on the show. Your votes will determine

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.660
what the next song to go into Orange Lounge Playlist rotation during the

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.660
The Bahmani Music and More program, which plays when we're not on this station, will be.

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:52.660
And, uh, yeah. So, in the meantime, enjoy some Guitar Freaks music.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.660
Yay.

Oh no!

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.980
It's me!

01:26:47.980 --> 01:27:13.980
Music

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:20.980
Orange Lounge Radio with the Bing Pong Ball!

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:48.980
I need some good cage match music. What's a good cage match song?

01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:53.980
Something 2DX-ish. I'm thinking something kind of...

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.980
QQQ

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.980
Ooh, I don't know if I have We Will Rock You. I might.

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:02.980
I think I have one of the other Queen covers in another directory.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.980
How about, like, uh...

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:05.980
Radical Aid?

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.980
Okay, alright, that'll work.

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:11.980
Oh, Slag works for another segment, don't you think?

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.980
And then Electrotuned.

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:19.460
Do you have Electrotune?

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:25.800
I have everything, I just have everything.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800
I think?

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.440
You could play Tengoku no Kiss.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.440
How about Holic?

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.440
It's a good song.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.440
How about Holic?

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.440
Holic will work.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440
What?

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440
What?

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440
What?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440
What, JB, what?

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440
Get out!

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.520
You are banned from the show!

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:50.720
just admitted that he does not like Jake that does not like tag oh he likes QQQ

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.640
all right I think Clifford that absolutely the Clifford ball at him the

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.920
Clifford ball of justice has been tossed to JB without further ado the bamani cage

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.760
match now since the first time we've done the bamani cage match what this is

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.760
gonna be all about is we're gonna play you two songs and they aren't from any

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.960
the money can't play that out front they're not running for money but they

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.320
have something to do with

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.520
either a bamani artist

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.180
a bamani uh... some kind of money relations like uh... another cover of a

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:25.320
bamani solid another dance maniacs

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.440
dance track

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.280
or it's just kind of video game related

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.360
because tonight we have one song that's five an artist that somewhat related to

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.840
ddr and we have a song this video game related so what we do is we take two

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:41.880
songs, put them together, and you guys will vote which one's good and which one is not

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:47.760
so good. And whichever one is voted in will be added to the playlist for the future. So

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.960
the Monty Michigan More Program all week long it will be in the playlist, and maybe for

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.760
a little, maybe we'll actually keep it in for a month, I don't know.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:00.760
Yeah, the winner wins. Yes. The winner is then challenged next week by a new song, and

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.760
if the new song beats the winner out, then it plays for the week, otherwise the winner

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.760
The winner will stay on and play for the next week.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.760
It's really different all the way through.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.760
Well, what do you guys think?

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.760
I don't know.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.760
Full song?

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.760
Okay, we'll do this.

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.760
We'll do this.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:49.760
We'll, um, well, okay, we'll just, we'll do the whole thing.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:54.760
So, what we're going to do, though, is we're not going to go into that right just yet.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:58.760
We'll go to another topic on the program and kind of do that as our next break.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.760
You want to do it now?

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760
All right, we'll do it now.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:06.760
Okay, so the two songs we're going to match up tonight in the Big Milani Cage match.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.760
Oop, not Viv ribbon, my bad.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.760
Maybe that'll be next week though.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:18.760
Okay, the two songs are the Zippers with All Around the World, the bubble mix.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.760
And for those that don't know who the Zippers are, well, JB, you're the expert.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:24.760
Why don't you tell everybody who the Zippers are and what they've done in DDR.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:30.760
The Zippers were Jenny Rom versus Zippers and they did Wakka Wakka.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.760
And you can't really tell the difference between them, because they both sound exactly the same.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:43.000
Okay, and the second song that we're going to have playing is going to be, it's actually

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.560
an overclock remix done by Final Fantasy, or FFMusicDJ.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:55.000
It's Final Fantasy VII String Machine, the Corel Prison Mix.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.320
Corel or Corel, whatever.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.920
So first we're going to play, and then you'll also get to get our opinion, since we have

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.140
to participate in this somehow. We're not getting to vote in this. You're gonna get

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:10.040
our big fat opinions on this. We're gonna be like the American Idol judges on these

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:14.600
songs. So if they suck, we're gonna let you know. So we're putting on our judging faces

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.040
right now. So, and then once we've given you our opinions on the songs, you'll be able

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.200
to vote. Now here's the thing. Don't vote until they've both been played or your vote

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.880
doesn't count. I'm not counting any votes that come in until the second song has finished

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.200
completely. Yes, they're saying they can't hear you on the air, JB. You wanna scream

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:38.380
something at the chair? Ah! Brilliant. All right, so here we go, starting off the Bemani

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:45.380
cage match. This is the zippers with All Around the World.

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:16.380
Come on, come on, come on, we wanna get some fun all around the world

one-to-ten jamie

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.000

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.040

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.040
if u

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.120
uh...

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.000
by going on

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.100
all right they'd be

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.900
you like it doesn't save them

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.620
i've heard a bradley your thoughts on that song

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.260
okay but

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:13.260
going on and on the same

01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.900
it's going to come to my brain

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.780
loads

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:20.580
over more hours a day

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:23.900
when you've got the postal

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.580
or back

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:28.220
i agree my thoughts are was very happy happy happy happy it was kind of like

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:31.700
nauseatingly happy at the beginning was bad but

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:36.220
I could deal with it. It's not that bad. It's kind of, it's a nice, nice change of pace

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:43.220
from, you know, meanness. Nice? In what dictionary? Are you going to notthedictionary.com? No,

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.020
that's what makes me want to go out and kill people. And sing while I'm doing it. Alright,

01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:53.780
so... It makes me happy noodle boy happy. Alright, going around the room, quick, scale

01:38:53.780 --> 01:39:00.780
of one to ten. What do you think? Uh... Logie? 1.5. 1.5. Bradley? Probably about four. Probably

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:09.780
JB. Ten. I will give it a six. I'll give it a six. Alright. So that was Zippers all around the world.

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.780
Here's the second song in the Cage Match. This is by Final Fantasy Music DJ. It's an overclocked remix.

01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:18.780
This is the Final Fantasy VII String Machine, here on the Bomani Cage match.

01:43:44.780 --> 01:44:07.580
That was fucking cool.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.480
It's the Balani Cage match going on right now.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.420
You can start sending in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email, orangeloungeradio

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:19.140
at yahoo.com and it is once again the zippers with all around the world was

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:22.900
the first song we played and that song was Final Fantasy music DJ an overclocked

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:29.300
remix of Final Fantasy 7 string machine so let's talk about what we thought of

01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:33.260
the Final Fantasy string machine Jamie your thoughts we love it

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:38.020
Loki of course love it it's one of the best Final Fantasy music remixes I've

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:42.220
ever heard which song was I couldn't recognize what song it was I guess it's

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:45.580
suppose it's yet for our present from

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.580
and i i i think in record

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:52.220
to me that i think you're a good thing

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.580
uh... okay

01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:56.920
uh... i think that i think that that's what that's all they could be

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.420
bradley about them

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.380
critical

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:02.500
all right you like it to be your thoughts

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.180
axes that he had the accident figures

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:08.620
but of course he's a he's a cheney rom horse of course you have to do it

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620
not happy enough for.

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:13.300
If it had that and then went, we, we, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, we wouldn't have

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.300
liked it.

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.700
My thoughts on that song were that it's kind of, I like the trance type, I'm a horror for

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.340
that trancey kind of music.

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.580
Somebody in the chat room, let's go over, oh, let's go over, well, I'll talk for a second.

01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:24.580
Somebody in the chat room, though, said that it sounds like something from Fantasia, I

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:25.580
really agree with that.

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.580
It does sound like kind of a Fantasia track.

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:31.740
I think that's very cool, although it's a little bit kind of repetitive for my taste,

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:32.740
I don't know.

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.740
I found it to be a little bit repetitive.

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.660
So that's my only issue with it.

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:38.580
So scale of one to ten, Jamie, what do you think?

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.580
Nine.

01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.580
Nine.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:41.580
Loki.

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.580
Ten.

01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.580
Ten.

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.580
Bradley.

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:45.580
Eight.

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:46.580
JB.

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:47.580
Four.

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:48.580
I'm gonna give it a seven.

01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:53.100
So, it sounds like that song would win if we were the people voting, but we're not because

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.580
this is everybody's show.

01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:55.580
It's not just our show.

01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.140
It's a chatroom show, an email show.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:03.500
So send in your votes right now via the chatroom or our email address, orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:08.300
If you want the zippers to win or you want the Final Fantasy VII string machine to win.

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:11.300
That's it. That's my Kate's match. We'll have the results for you after the next break.

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.300
This is just a little message to vote for Final Fantasy.

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.300
In the meantime...

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.300
The ferret commands it.

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.300
Let's talk about another big event that happened this week.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.300
The ferret likes JB better.

01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:23.300
The ferret likes JB better, what?

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.300
I think the ferret likes JB better.

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:27.300
Everybody can vote for zippers.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.300
The ferret wants everybody to vote for zippers, you said.

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.300
Alright.

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.300
Alright, we'll get to the results after the next break.

01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.300
That's it. That's it.

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:39.500
I don't want to go back into musical. We've got so much to talk about here

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:43.220
Big news this week big Bahmani holiday

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:48.980
19 November and 20 November were both this week and we had some very big things happen Jamie

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:54.460
Tell us about I feel you want to talk about 20 November in its honor on 2dx. Oh, yes

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.380
I'd like to just I guess consider or just

01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:02.500
Basically say 1920 November would pretty much be the Bahmani New Year's

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:07.300
years. That's pretty much what it is since 20 November was pretty much the start of the

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:10.780
whole Bimani line with BeatMania, so I would consider it the New Year's.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.580
I don't know if I consider it New Year's, it's not a big party, it's just kind of like

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:19.740
a day of remembrance. It's Bimani Veterans Day.

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.460
It's just like Chinese New Year's, I mean no one celebrates that.

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.120
Well the Chinese do I think. Oh yeah, like they count, okay.

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.860
They're only like, you know, I think a quarter of the world's population.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.860
Who cares? That's pretty much what it is. It's an uncelebrated holiday.

01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.860
It's like Arbor Day.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:39.860
Okay, so it's the Bamani Arbor Day.

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:42.860
Plant a Bamani machine.

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:46.860
So what were some big events that happened in the community?

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.860
I know you know of one. Jamie, you want to talk about this earlier?

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.860
I got online and they were like...

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.860
The show wasn't there, it was like robbed.

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:55.860
Oh yeah, Orange Islands Radio did a celebration.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:48:00.860
Very late on 19 November around 11.30 we kind of had a countdown until 20 November did some music.

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.860
And we had video game guessing.

01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.860
Yes, and then 20 November was celebrated guessing old school 8-bit video game tunes.

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:11.860
Which is why you should be listening to Orange Lawn's radio all the time.

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:12.860
Yes, half your life like us.

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:18.860
Sometimes you get to hear special live music programs. They happen occasionally. We call them the fuck-offs.

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:19.860
The ferret commands it.

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:23.860
The ferret commands that you listen to. The chat room demands it.

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:29.340
I haven't said that yet tonight, so I needed to.

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:33.220
A couple website re-enovations or relaunches this week, Jamie?

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.220
Let's hear it for ddrspot.com.

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.220
Weee!

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.220
Hey, ddrspot.com.

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:41.140
We've got a lot of buddies there, Mel B. I would call a frequent guest of this show at

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:45.460
this point, Mel B. He's a big part of that team, so I know he's very proud of it.

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:49.780
People who were really good with helping, those of us who were working with our tournament

01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:56.140
Shaft. Big shout out to Mike Noh and AJ for encoding the videos and putting them up on

01:48:56.140 --> 01:49:00.900
DDR Spot. So hey, you can see what our Scandio looks like if you go there and download them.

01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:06.540
And the whole group of people with DDR Spot, they're really cool people. So you can also

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.700
go get ringtones. I think they're all Nokia ringtones of all.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:14.300
I can't use the Nokia ringtones and that makes me cry. But we wanted to play your ringtone,

01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:15.300
didn't we?

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.300
Well, my ringtone's not Beymani, but...

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.940
Well, let's play your ringtone anyway, because we wanted to do this.

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.700
So I'm going to call you right now, Jamie. No, I can just play it. Oh, you can just play it?

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:28.500
Never mind. Don't give me any voicemail, dammit.

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:35.500
My ringtone is cooler than everybody.

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.240
I'm trying to see if anybody in the chat room is going to recognize it.

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.680
I'll play it again.

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.680
No, you will play it again, apparently.

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:58.680
I will too.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.200
Vidpower says it's Chun-Li's stage.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.880
WRONG!

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.160
Oh, 23rd Magus says that too.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.160
you know

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.920

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.360
Oh, because my vibrate's on. Whoops, my bad.

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.360
Yeah, Rob's pocket vibrator.

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.360
Yes, my cell phone doubles as a vibrator.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360
Every call is a happy call.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.360
My cell phone doubles as a vibrator. It's quite exciting.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.360
Oh, that doesn't work.

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.360
What happened?

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.360
Those are my magical ringtones here.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.360
No, we can't guess what that is.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:14.440
That's AfroNova, right?

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.920
No, it's a song called The Entertainer.

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:23.160
And I'm sure since there's this trend in Bimani to redo a bunch of classical songs in a Bimani

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:26.880
tune, I'm sure you'll see that tune up in a Bimani song one day.

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.680
If you play that song again you just go...

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.680
Whoa!

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.680
Dude!

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.980
It's a talker remix!

01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:36.160
Yeah, hey, you should put that in your sim.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.160
They need to do the bad synthy music and make it a pada-pada.

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:45.160
Stop playing with a ferret, give me that!

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:53.160
So yes, other 1920 November celebrations, in Japan I believe they released the code

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.440
to unlock eight styles hidden stuff, so now you don't have to...

01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.440
We were thinking...

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440
I can play Sakura and fail with style.

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:03.560
Yes, now you can play Sakura without having to AAA, you know, be for you on another heavy

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:04.880
whatever.

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:05.880
And then Xenon.

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.880
two brand new songs also.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.880
But no tag.

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.880
No more tag.

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.880
Sorry, Jamie.

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:13.880
Don't poke me back, ferret.

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:14.880
You have to wait for Night Style.

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.880
You think there's going to be a Night Style?

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880
Yeah, I think so too.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880
God yes.

01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880
God yes.

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.880
Give me the ferret.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:25.440
I'm not sure if this happened exactly on 19-20 November, but another website news, 2DX Style

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:29.760
kind of got eaten up by BomaniStyle.com, right?

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.280
Was that earlier or what happened with that?

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.280
That's still last week.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:33.280
That was last week.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.280
My bad.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.280
What? Didn't they kind of celebrate it?

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:40.280
Bomani style re-did their site, so that's another one.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.280
I guess that's 20 November-ish, I don't know.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.280
That's 19 November-ish.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.280
Any other websites that re-did special things for 2020 November? I can't think of any that can.

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.280
DDR Spot was probably the biggest one.

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:56.280
DnR Maniacs deleted my account along with 2,000 other ones, so I guess that's 20 November related.

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.280
Sorta.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:52:59.280
Big oops.

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.280
Happy 20 November!

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.280
Happy 20 November!

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.980
I went to bed and then I went to work. Yes, how did you

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:09.820
privately celebrate 20 November amongst ourselves in the room? What was your own

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:11.500
way of celebrating 20 November?

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:16.140
Well, first of all I went to bed and then I woke up and went to work

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:19.540
and instead of doing my work I talked on

01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:22.580
my email with my friend in Maryland

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:26.580
and then I went home and I failed 20 November

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:31.100
in sixth style on seven key because it's a seven star and I can't pass any yet, although

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:34.700
close and then I put it away

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:39.500
and went online and posted on a bunch of message boards and then played Animal Crossing

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.740
and then I told you November again

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:48.500
yeah and I full comboed some songs but I forgot what they were

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:53.460
and I passed Fantasy. You go girl! I passed Fantasy and Light 7 on 4th style

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:57.300
alright that was like one of the last two songs I had to do but I fucking hate

01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.380
Get On Beat thank you

01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:00.380
Next.

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.380
Loki, how did you celebrate 20 November?

01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:04.380
Oh, I did one more thing. I did one more thing.

01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:06.380
I went to bed.

01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:10.380
I played DDR at lunch.

01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:12.380
That's it.

01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:14.380
Alright, yes. Bradley, how did you celebrate 20 November?

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.380
Mmm, I didn't really do much of anything.

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.380
Bless me!

01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.380
JP, how did you celebrate 20 November?

01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:24.380
I secretly worshipped Jini Ram.

01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:28.460
How's that different from any other day?

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.780
That means he had a faptastic time.

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.140
He had a faptastic 20 November, yes.

01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.020
Thank you, Jamie.

01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:36.660
How did I celebrate 20 November?

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:42.360
I went to work, I came home, I watched 24, I continued my three week streak of not playing

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.100
any DDR, jerked off and went to bed.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.100
Just kidding.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.100
Fascinating.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.100
Or at least you'll never know.

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.100
Yes, Logie?

01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:54.100
You know, I know this is really the wrong segment to be doing this.

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.100
That's alright.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:58.100
But I just remembered another F.U. for the week.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.100
And it goes...

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.100
Wait, wait, wait, you don't need to play the music.

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:02.100
You don't need to play the music.

01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:04.100
Oh, fine.

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:07.100
Jamie demands I play the music. Therefore, I play the music.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:15.100
F.U. to the Sac-Bomani server for fucking crashing constantly all this week.

01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.100
That's it.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.100
That's it.

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.100
Oh, also...

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:21.100
Yeah, but you can pay for any place to host us.

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:27.700
F you to sacmomani.com as well for not having the space on it to host the Orange Lounge

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.860
forums as well, because that kind of caused the crash, because I was kind of trying to

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:34.600
set up a little surprise for 20 November for Orange Lounge, and that kind of pushed us

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:35.600
over quota.

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.600
My bad.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:37.600
No.

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.440
And F you for Rob for the...

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.880
My account got deleted yet again from another glitch I happen to be...

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:48.540
If you're the one that posts that causes the quota to get hit, then you get your account

01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.540
deleted.

01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:50.540
Lucky me!

01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:53.940
Because I'm always online posting, whatever.

01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.380
You got a bigger post count out of it, I think, anyway.

01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.380
As if that stuff didn't...

01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:58.380
Oh no, you didn't.

01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.380
I don't know.

01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.380
I guessed.

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.380
Not that matters.

01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.380
You're still number one!

01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:03.380
It don't matter!

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.380
Shit!

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:06.740
I'm 500 posts above anyone else.

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.020
We'll get you to your ho and back, lickety-split!

01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:13.020
No shit!

01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:24.220
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back, and we're going to announce the winner

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.900
of the Bamani cage match.

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:28.380
There is still time to vote.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:32.780
Just come to our chat room and vote via private message for the zippers with All Around the

01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.900
World or the Final Fantasy VII string machine.

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:39.220
Or you can send it over email, orangelaungeradio.yahoo.com.

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.780
And there's a conversation in the chat room going on right now saying, I worked on a Brilliant

01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:15.660
There's two vocal mixes of flotation, this is the other one that you don't normally hear

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:16.660
on Orange Lounge.

01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.660
But you're going to hear it right now, so enjoy.

01:57:46.660 --> 01:58:13.660
Follow me with a friend of mine Load away, leave it all behind

01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:57.660
I'm not, you're always standing on my side of me

01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:11.660
Standing on my side of me

02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:19.660
Oh, oh, oh Proud of me

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:32.660
Oh, oh, oh Proud of me

02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:39.660
Leave an end of mine, go away

02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:46.660
Leave it all behind, follow me

02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:53.660
Leave an end of mine, go away

02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:55.660
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:48.500
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.500
The Orange Lounge Bamani Music and More Show.

02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:57.500
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:04.500
It's unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:07.500
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 21.

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:14.500
And now it's time to reveal the winner of the Big Bamani Cage Match.

02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:20.500
Tonight in the cage match we had the Zippers with All Around the World.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:23.500
Let me play a little clip of that for you to remind you what this sounds like.

02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:31.500
That was the Zippers with All Around the World.

02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.500
And the other song we played was the Final Fantasy VII String Machine.

02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:44.640
All right, those are the two songs that were in the cage match tonight, and I am pleased

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:52.300
to announce the winner is, by a pretty close vote, not too far apart, the winner is the

02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:57.540
Final Fantasy VII String Machine, ladies and gentlemen.

02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:58.540
All right.

02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.540
People have taste.

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:01.820
You have renewed my faith in humanity.

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:06.300
So the Final Fantasy VII string machine will be added into the Orange Lounge playlist this

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:07.300
week.

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:11.100
So check for that during the Bimani Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day,

02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.940
7 days a week on this station when we aren't here.

02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:15.940
Sorry JB, Zipper's lost.

02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:19.820
I'm gonna kill everybody who voted for it.

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:21.620
I'll give you all the names after the show.

02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:26.720
Alright, and if you want a copy of that Final Fantasy VII remix, it's an overclocked remix

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.460
so you can find it on Overclock.org.

02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:32.340
Or if you want the zippers, you can contact me.

02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:34.060
If you want the zippers, just contact JB.

02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:35.700
Or anything else.

02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:36.700
Anything?

02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:37.700
Favors?

02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:38.700
No.

02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:39.700
Like favors?

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:40.700
Oh, yes.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:44.140
I think Mr. Spanky has some things he needs done.

02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:47.180
That's quite all right.

02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:49.740
Does Mr. Spanky need to be spanked?

02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:53.980
Some quick things, some things that have been coming through the chat room and some various

02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:57.860
little stories as the two hours have already passed that we've been on the air.

02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:34.860
the next two Saturdays and my F.U. to his birthday for being next Monday.

02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:01.860
I'm not falling through, and I promise.

02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:04.580
We got a nephew over email.

02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:06.700
Muhimer of New Jersey.

02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:07.700
Moo.

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.700
Moo.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:11.140
He says, a fuck you goes out to his mom.

02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.140
I'm sorry, not his mom.

02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.820
I'm sorry.

02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:17.020
A fuck you goes out to his room for being small.

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:19.260
That's what happens when I have the mouse over the R-O.

02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:21.820
I just assume it's another word that ends in O-M. My bad.

02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:22.740
Sorry.

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.900
That was a big fuck you going out to his room for being small.

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:32.060
nothing wrong with small rooms. I have a small room. It's all about stacking. Stacking will

02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:38.180
save you so much space. I've got like 400 DVDs, a whole bunch of movies, a computer,

02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:43.660
seven game systems, a queen size bed, and I still have room to move. And this studio

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:47.540
that we do this very show in is very small, as JB learned for the first time today. That's

02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:52.340
why you go to Walmart and you get those stacky crates and put your stuff in them. No, you

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:59.340
go to Kmart because remember Kmart is my favorite store I shot there cause I is poor. Yay Kmart.

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:07.180
That was a cheer that they used to do in high school on the bus going to the band. Alright

02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:12.180
and I would like to fuck you to Kmart for like a sock going down the tooth. You have

02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:18.180
Kmart socks? Yeah cause like my dad gave me. Just like my dad. This is sort of a trash

02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:22.540
one time thing. My dad's like, that's how it sucks. Somehow I didn't suck. Somehow

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:27.540
they went up like $13 one time. And then they crashed down to like a dollar and now they're

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:33.540
like 50 cents. But I've been holding them just for experiences to watch. A dying company.

02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:37.340
I'm pretty sure they'll be with Lynn.

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:43.460
I have another FU. Muhimer had two FUs. Please allow me to finish. Also, fuck swishy pants

02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:46.940
cuz they're doing

02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:48.700
it's what you get

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:53.660
they sell it but they have to do that is so signed over there

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:55.780
we should be at what's up with that

02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:58.820
now i remember it never is with george okay

02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:02.900
yet but i think that that would grab next to each other up together to play

02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:05.820
for so fast

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:10.840
and it was like when he's going to be a grant

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.420
I wonder, what about D.E.R. and Swishy Pants?

02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:15.640
That would be...

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:18.720
Max 300 and Swishy Pants. That would be funny.

02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.960
You can see this.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:26.400
God, we're getting more F.U.s a little late. This is it. No more F.U.s. These are the last ones, alright?

02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:29.320
F.U. to Raver's Groove or whatever.

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.800
D.T. was one of the poor, unfortunate souls that got to your Raver's Groove play on Orange

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.220
Lounge about six times in an hour.

02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:37.720
Let me play.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:42.240
It happens to be one of my favorites okay, and it's not my fault that that happened. It's not the song's fault

02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:44.240
So get over it

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:47.240
and the claws show

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960
alright

02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:54.800
Let's see

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.660
F you at late f you

02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:59.900
Yeah

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.080
If you two kids on the pad while I'm playing and I'm like bitch get off

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:14.800
off? Bitch. 23rd Magus says, this is a nephew, he has a little story he'd like to tell, please.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:20.200
Here's a story of a lovely F-you. It's not an F-you, it's a different one. He said, this

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.000
is how he celebrated 20 November. Reading music, reading music. This is a late 20 November

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.760
story, I'm sorry. I don't have 20, I have a T November, that'll just have to work. I

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.600
I don't have 20 November queued up, and I don't feel like pulling up.

02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.480
Uh, late 19, 20 November celebration story.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.680
I went to the roof of the school and yelled out,

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.840
Beeee, Mani, at the top of my lungs. No, seriously. I did. Yep.

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:44.520
And then I took the deer-in-the-headlights looks.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:45.800
Loser! I mean...

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.080
Hey, now. Be nice.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:48.680
That was cool.

02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:51.040
I think that's cool. Especially the deer-in-the-headlights parts.

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:54.920
Anything that'll get you deer-in-the-headlights looks are awesome.

02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:56.640
Fabulous. Fabulous.

02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:59.720
Did he mention he was doing it dressed up like Mr. Spanky?

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.720
I don't want to see him dressed as Mr. Spanky, I'm sorry.

02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:04.720
Alright.

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.720
Those were the late FUs and things of the week.

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:09.720
So there you go.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:14.720
You can always send your FUs in a little early if you're not going to be here for the live show.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:16.720
You can always send those over e-mail or on the launchradio at yahoo.com.

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:18.720
That's what Dave did tonight and he got his in.

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.720
I have an important announcement to make.

02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:21.720
Yes?

02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:27.720
I got the hooker to have sex with me in Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:28.720
Thank you very much.

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.720
much.

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:36.240
Well, isn't that special?

02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:39.840
Hookers are the work of the devil.

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:41.400
Alright.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:46.440
Satan's little play pal.

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.000
Let's see.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.800
I'm hoping the other people left, that we're in the house right now.

02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.800
Are they really?

02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:24.320
I had some, oh, and now I'm getting 20 November stories, that's alright, we need something

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:31.320
the show

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:34.000
about it

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:41.000
on twenty november his friend broke his arm

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.660
uh... twenty-third magis sense of the randomness here he says

02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:50.520
my english essay was titled i was shocked and all i got was lousy roast

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.440
beef

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.600
hot hot hot

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.320
that has nothing to do with twenty november silly

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:02.760
uh... socal kicks wants to point out he broke his arm in soccer not like

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.200
drinking off or anything

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:08.920
well that would have been a lot more humorous don't you think? that would have been cool

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:13.020
it would have been seriously

02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:16.920
really clumsy

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.040
that was so eight days a week

02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:20.040
breaking your neck

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.600
trying to uh...

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:25.600
perform self-fulatia.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.020
OK, this one last one... no more 20 Nm stories, we don't care.

02:14:29.020 --> 02:14:33.220
I'm just kidding. DCB says he played Beatmania's second mix and got a

02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:34.920
100% greats on Overdozer.

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:39.620
You're special. You are very very special.

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.000
Alright, no more 20...

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.380
what? What? This is actually Pimani related. Oh, dear God, what?

02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:51.480
And because of 20 November, happened to be falling on a Wednesday,

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.480
There was a new Naoki Journal.

02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:54.480
Yes.

02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.480
Boo!

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.480
Yeah, well, they announced the new Naoki Underground song, which, I mean...

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.480
Now, that's cool.

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.480
Naoki Underground stuff is good.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.480
I mean, you've got, um...

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:09.480
You've got Insertion, and you've got, uh, whatever that French song...

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.480
Le Moi et Le Beaté, or whatever.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.480
Yeah, whatever that crap is.

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:14.480
Anyways, uh...

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:19.480
So, um, they announced the new song Tears.

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:53.640
the bell where Jessie has a breakdown, because she's addicted to caffeine pills, and I watched

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:55.640
that on 20 November.

02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:56.640
What?

02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.640
Caffeine pills?

02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:01.800
She was addicted to caffeine pills!

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:06.240
And then she's just going and then she's like, I'm so excited, I'm so excited, I'm so scared!

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:10.280
It was the finest acting Elizabeth Berkley's ever done next to Showgirls.

02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:13.800
Aside from grinding her hip into some poor stranger.

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:20.360
Okay, you mean, you gotta, you would've, I mean, I'm sorry, but even if it was an acting

02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:27.280
situation, that's to be high, oh, damn, we got the scene wrong, do again, oh yeah, oh,

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:35.120
got it wrong again, I love my job, alright, okay, let's go to, oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:41.800
just not feeling that, we gotta do it again, yeah, where's the emotion, do again, this

02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.280
This time, we'll take those still photos.

02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.560
Once more, with feeding.

02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:50.560
Let's go to the news.

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.800
This is something that really doesn't have anything to do with Bemani, but it's kind

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:55.320
of funny anyway.

02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.300
I know a lot of people that play Bemani eat a lot of fast food, and a lot of people also

02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:01.880
kind of play Bemani as a way to diet.

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:02.880
Some people play.

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:05.460
I admit, when I started playing DDR, I thought it was cool because I was suddenly losing

02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:06.460
weight.

02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:09.160
Of course, now that I haven't played DDR in about a month, I'm gaining it all back, but

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:10.160
that's beside the point.

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:17.160
I read this funny little article and get your guys' thoughts on it.

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:47.160
is

02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.420
okay

02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:54.420
lawyers claim that big backs make kids fat

02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:56.480
well

02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.140
are big max hazardous to children's health

02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:02.520
lawyers a file the class-action lawsuit against mcdonald's on behalf of new

02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:06.200
york children who have suffered health problems including diabetes high blood

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:07.640
pressure and obesity

02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:11.160
In a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, a lawyer alleged that the fast food chain

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:15.760
has created a national epidemic of obese children.

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:20.080
Samuel Hirsch agreed that the high fat, sugar and cholesterol content of McDonald's food

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:25.520
is a very incepted, toxic kind of thing when ingested regularly by young kids.

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:30.160
The plaintiffs include a Bronx teen who ate every meal at McDonald's for three years while

02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:32.920
living in a homeless shelter.

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:37.080
Another is a 13-year-old boy from Staten Island who says he ate McDonald's food three to four

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:43.160
four times a week, and is now five foot four and two hundred and seventy-eight pounds.

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.880
McDonald's lawyer Brad Lerman insisted that the lawsuit was a frivolous attempt to cash

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:50.320
in on the golden arches, the kind of lawsuit that shouldn't be in court.

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.600
People don't go to sleep and then wake up obese, Lerman said.

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.360
The understanding and comprehension of what hamburgers and french fries do to us have

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.920
been with us for a long, long time.

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:06.320
McDonald's has asked Judge Robert Sweet to dismiss the case, arguing those who filed

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:10.880
the claims cannot show their health woes were caused by Big Macs and insisting the company

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:18.040
has never misled customers about his food. The judge did not immediately rule on the

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:19.040
request.

02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:20.040
What was that?

02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:21.040
We had the visitor just come in.

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.960
Dude, all I gotta say is, fucking exercise, you lazy bastard. Shit, man, I eat fast food

02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.080
every day of the week, you know, and I'm not like some big tub of lard that's like walking

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:38.080
here

02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:40.480
you sound like the for you just then

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:44.360
here

02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.720
okay

02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:49.080
uh...

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:54.080
but

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.600
it's a bit chastising

02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.160
low-key

02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:58.640
anyway

02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.520
So what did you think about the Big Mac story?

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:06.320
First of all, McDonald's is disgusting and I haven't eaten there in easily four years.

02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:10.040
Except that they had those really tasty bagel sandwiches.

02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:14.160
DCB and Orange Beanie were in the chat room suggesting that the following

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:16.200
should go along with this.

02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:18.160
This place is a rock.

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:21.900
It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.

02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:24.500
It is a good place to listen to the music.

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:31.500
people flock here to get down to the rock music. Rock and roll McDonald's! Rock and

02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:39.940
roll McDonald's! Rock and roll McDonald's! Yes, rock and roll McDonald's, ladies and

02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:44.540
gentlemen. See, if everybody would just rock and roll a little bit, while they're at McDonald's

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:48.900
eating Big Macs, maybe they wouldn't get so fat. Well, you know, they put the nutritional

02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:54.760
information, they're easily readable. I don't know, maybe most of the people who eat there

02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:59.180
are illiterate, I don't know. You know, those people eating those Big Macs are the same

02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:05.380
people who think the smoking doesn't hurt anyway, the things that the government's not

02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:12.380
corrupt, and they have no tune with the obvious at all. It's like, huh? Those are unhealthy

02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:17.620
like, huh? Those are unhealthy for me? Don't you think someone would tell me that?

02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:23.600
This goes back to people being really stupid, okay? People are going to watch TV, and they're

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.720
going to see this on there, and they're thinking, oh, that looks, even though they're basically

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:31.560
looking at big piles of glycerin that are colored so they don't melt into light or something,

02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:35.200
they're looking at this and they're thinking, oh, well, that looks tasty, and it's so ingrained

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:40.960
into society that the general masses, who are unfortunately really stupid, are going

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:45.200
fall for it. You know what I think is very funny, I don't know if this goes hand in hand,

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:50.640
but since I stopped watching TV so much, I've eaten out so often, at least at major chains.

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.400
There's this one lady that works at McDonald's that has no teeth.

02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:01.280
But the whole thing is, is that it's a matter of choice in using your brain,

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:05.280
and unfortunately people just don't know how to use their brain. They want to be

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:10.000
sheep like everybody else. There's this one chick at the McDonald's that we used to go to actually

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.160
that it's just some Chinese chick with an eyepatch. We used to go, ARRRRR! Every time

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:22.760
we'd get our stuff from her, it was quite funny. That's kind of mean. ARRRRR, me tea!

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:29.220
We called it Macarena. Hand over me Big Mac! One thing I have to say about McDonald's,

02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:34.100
one time I went to McDonald's, this one where I buy my work, and I ordered two hamburgers

02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:38.000
without cheese and without onions, because I cannot fucking stand McDonald's onions.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.000
the nastiest fucking shit on this earth. Dehydrated onions? What the hell is up with that?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
They're awesome. They're awesome. I love them.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I like them.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Gross. Anyway.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I like them.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Well, F you to Bradley for liking McDonald's onions.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Fuck you for not liking them.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.700
Okay. So, I order my burger without cheese and without onions, right? I get it back to

02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:59.820
work. I open it up, and what do I find? I go, gosh, this hamburger seems awfully thin.

02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:06.400
I bite into it. No meat. I bit into two pieces of bread covered in ketchup and mustard and

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:13.400
pickles. Fuck McDonald's, God. But this is what happened. My coworker, since I'm kind

02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:19.200
of a pussy, I let people walk all over me like that. My coworker heard me, I was running,

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.240
of course, only the way I could do, I started, you know, what's the first thing I'm going

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:25.360
to do when I get a bad burger? I run around and show all my coworkers, oh, look how McDonald's

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:27.960
fucked me over. And I'm like, well, let's eat a burger, and I open it up where I took

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:31.620
a bite. And my coworker's like, you're not going to put up with that crap, are you? So

02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:36.360
he calls and he got me two free meals at McDonald's. This was about six weeks ago, and I said,

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:40.800
still haven't used my free meals to McDonald's like here more poison for you

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:44.600
so if you want to a free meal at McDonald's just go over to McDonald's on

02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.780
Madison and hazel and tell them that never mind I'm not gonna tell you who

02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:55.560
sent you it's not under my name all right they're dumbasses that's the same

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:59.880
place I went there we're getting our meal and the guys and talking it through

02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:03.760
the PA system out we're gonna know where the drive-through stuff is he's like

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:05.760
Kenny!

02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:07.760
It's because his friend ran out to the car.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:09.760
Kenny!

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:11.760
Kenny!

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:13.760
Kenny, I know you can hear me!

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:15.760
Meanwhile, we're sitting in the window going

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:17.760
Food?

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:19.760
Give us our food?

02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.760
Kenny! Give me a $6 burger!

02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.760
Kenny!

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.760
Kenny!

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:27.760
I'm like, fucker! Just give me the god damn food!

02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:29.760
It was like sitting on the back counter.

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.760
I could see it with my own eyes.

02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:40.480
own eyes like can't reach food he's a Kenny the guy was fucking dumbass that's

02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:46.000
all I have to say oh my god they killed Kenny um ah yes orange beanie saying

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:53.720
meat is bad just be a vegetarian and don't eat McDonald's as bad I used to

02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:56.480
date a vegan and it was really interesting going to McDonald's because

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.080
they couldn't even eat the fries really so oh you gotta go was that your pager

02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.360
Say bye to everybody.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:03.840
Any closing thoughts from JB?

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:04.840
Jenny Rome.

02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:06.840
Thank you, JB.

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:08.680
Need pork, daddy!

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.040
That's all I had to say about that.

02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.440
Alright, so I was reading some things in the talkback for that story because those are

02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:17.880
always interesting to read.

02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:22.400
I'm gonna get drunk and sue Budweiser, said one person.

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.400
Let's see.

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.720
Hey fat people, what's this one say?

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:28.600
You have no one else to blame but yourselves, kids blame your fat parents.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:29.880
I am skinny and I am McDonald's.

02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:32.980
If you have a predisposition to gaining weight, simply don't eat there.

02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:35.900
I can believe I have to educate stupid fat people.

02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:38.980
Stop thinking about food for just one second, and maybe then you'll realize how pathetic

02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:40.120
your argument is.

02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:42.940
And please don't ruin it for those of us who enjoy Big Macs and eat responsibly, Ona.

02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:44.780
Have you ever heard of exercise?

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:46.100
Self-centered greedy fat bastards.

02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:47.100
My word!

02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:48.900
The potty mouse on Yahoo Talkback.

02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:49.900
Hey, Rob.

02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:55.160
There's another headline I saw on Yahoo, because you know Yahoo has always the best headlines.

02:25:55.160 --> 02:26:00.520
It was some stupid kid, um, they threw a flaming chair at this kid in the back of a pickup

02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:01.520
truck.

02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.520
Okay.

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:05.560
And they were driving, okay, and this kid was part of it, and they were filming him.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560
And he hit him.

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.560
It was one of those jackass.

02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:12.220
And he got hurt, and they said, oh, it must have been from a jackass stunt.

02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:17.640
I'm like, what, so every dumb thing that stupid kids do and catch on camera is a jackass stunt?

02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:18.640
Yes.

02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:19.640
No.

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:21.120
I don't think so.

02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:22.960
It's funny, they have a part where you can rate the top.

02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:23.960
Look, you don't play that.

02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.160
I don't play that shit.

02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.640
You know what I think?

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:32.820
I think that all those, back to the topic at hand, the fast food crap,

02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:36.280
I think that those places actually,

02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:38.320
they need to be,

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:42.520
if they were subsidized for having a healthy menu and high quality food,

02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:46.360
which they could still make just as fast as the cheap crap that, you know,

02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:48.760
is so bad for you,

02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:54.420
if they were offered a government subsidy for providing good food to people

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:56.240
that would actually

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.540
i think improve a lot of the

02:26:58.540 --> 02:26:59.660
the health of

02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:00.840
consumers

02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:02.800
and possibly get them repeat business

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:05.460
but you know the thing is our government doesn't give a shit about it anyway

02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:09.280
well they've kind of improved their stuff, I mean they changed their fry recipe around to make it

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:13.140
like a lot less oil and there's less fat grams and stuff in there so

02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:16.200
they're doing stuff i mean

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:22.200
Why? I mean, we go there, we know what's in the food, we know that it's not meat between those patties, or between the bread.

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.200
Even so, as a manufacturer, you do have a responsibility to your consumer.

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:30.200
What about if they just put a DDR machine in every McDonald's?

02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:33.200
Two Big Macs and shitty ROM!

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:34.200
What's up?

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:36.200
Oh, that's that game for fags!

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:39.200
Oh, I'm gonna eat my burger!

02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:41.200
Oh, heart attack! Ugh! Die!

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:52.120
It just has to do with people caring enough about themselves and being smart enough to

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:53.520
know what's good for them.

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:54.520
Love yourself!

02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.800
No, I'm serious about this.

02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:05.560
I work in an office, I work by lots of food places, but even so, even if you have to go

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:10.440
out and eat, you're going to be able to find an alternative to the typical fast food chain

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:12.320
and find something healthy.

02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.760
There's this bagel cafe place that's near where I work.

02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.920
I can go there and get a turkey sandwich with avocado and mayonnaise and everything, and

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:19.920
that's nice and healthy.

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:24.960
Or I could go get freshly made teriyaki at another place just as fast.

02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:29.520
It's certainly more satisfying than going and getting a piece of bread that's been in

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:36.160
a bag for five years, and this piece of something that's supposed to resemble meat that probably

02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:42.760
still has the green ink stamp from when they stamped the damn thing in the first place.

02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:43.760
You can look at this.

02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:51.160
You can pay $5 and get this unsatisfying piece of shit burger and this soda which you're

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:54.720
actually paying about ten times what the value of the soda is.

02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:00.400
You can go buy a bottle of juice and get yourself a nice sandwich and overall, your body's going

02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:05.080
to thank you for it and people who complain they don't have any energy, they're not going

02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:09.200
to have that complaint anymore because they're actually going to be fueling themselves.

02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:10.640
There's the difference right there.

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:15.040
And also, there have been studies linked that prove that eating a consistent diet of fast

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:18.560
food also does contribute to stupidity.

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:21.720
Your brain functions are not as...

02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:24.840
Your brain doesn't function as properly when you're eating nothing but shit.

02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:25.840
Actually I heard just the opposite.

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:34.960
They just did a study on the news saying that snack foods give actually higher test results

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:37.960
in a short period of time.

02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:38.960
That's not fast food, though.

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:43.960
The thing is, if you eat any carbohydrate, it's going to increase your brain function.

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:46.960
Bombay has another great suggestion in the chat room.

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:48.960
How about you cook instead of eating in a fast food place?

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:50.960
Exactly!

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:53.960
I'm just talking about for people when you're at work and you haven't brought your lunch or something.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:54.960
You know, there's alternatives.

02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.960
Because I'm lazy and McDonald's takes two minutes to get, okay?

02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:00.960
That's what it comes down to, and I love their goddamn fries.

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:08.960
I can't stand the stupid people. I can't stand to go inside there. I can't stand to smell the ugly, nasty people that are in there. The smell is horrible.

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:17.960
This also goes back to those people who are on those low-carb diets. They don't realize that when they're eating no carbohydrates, they're actually killing themselves.

02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:24.960
The state of ketosis, basically, is the state that your body goes into when it's about to die. When it starts feeding on itself.

02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:31.200
The same people who are making this argument right here are the same people who go and

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:37.300
supersize their extra value meal and they get Diet Coke.

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.020
You know how many calories that saves them?

02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:44.580
They're making Diet Vanilla Coke now, did you hear that?

02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:46.700
Say that you're going to Burger King and you're getting a Whopper.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:51.740
First of all, a Whopper has a calorie count of 750 calories, your typical Whopper does.

02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:54.160
When you add your fries to it, you're adding another 300.

02:30:54.160 --> 02:31:02.780
there. You have in your hands the entire equivalent of a day's meal. I mean, an entire, you know,

02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:08.720
you have your whole day of eating in one meal. You know, changing your Coke from regular

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:13.580
to diet, you're basically removing 200 calories of that. That's incredibly stupid. But you

02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:22.920
know what? That's how they make their money. I drink 300 calorie hot chocolate. You're

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:31.060
some dairy from it. Actually, it's instant hot chocolate. They have enzymes in them.

02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:35.740
It's so chocolatey and good, I can't deny it. It's actually three packets of hot chocolate

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:41.460
mix because one and two are just not enough. Also, chocolate is good for your endorphins.

02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:50.940
It helps you release happy chemicals. Sounds happy. Yeah, it's an aphrodisiac. I'm sorry

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:56.100
for getting all brainy on people. I used to work at a GNC and an herb shop, so this is

02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:57.100
all stuff that I had to go.

02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:00.620
I hope people don't really expect us to talk three hours completely about DDR.

02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:01.820
Herbal shop, huh?

02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:10.500
Oh yeah, I can tell you what to do when you have a cold. Or, you know, maybe we should

02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:12.620
make this a regular thing, you know, health talk.

02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:15.940
Health chat, DDR dieting, workout mode.

02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:16.940
Well, seriously.

02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:17.940
On Orange Lounge.

02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:22.780
It also goes hand-in-hand with playing, you know, the DDR and pada-pada.

02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:26.960
This is why I agree that this topic is kind of relevant, it actually really is relevant

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:31.340
to the Bonnie community, because like I said, a lot of people play Be-Bonnie to stay fit.

02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:33.960
It's one of the things that appeal to them about the game.

02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:39.500
And I'm mad at Golf Land because they're trying to make me impotent, Link.

02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:43.600
They got rid of my surgery and replaced it with Mountain Dew.

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:45.440
Mountain Dew's bad.

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:47.000
It tastes like pee.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.440
I want my surge.

02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:49.440
Oh my god, I don't drink...

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:50.440
Hence the nickname Mountain Dew.

02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:53.240
That's all I ever drink is Mountain Dew.

02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:54.240
Mountain Spew.

02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:58.000
Does Mountain Dew really make you impotent?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.560
It's just all the yellow sticks or whatever it is.

02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:03.240
These are really going to matter for me anyway, but...

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:10.120
Ah, they're saying sushi is good, and Orange Beanie says the only meat he'll eat is sushi

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:14.200
on occasion, and then Swiftrock says McDonald's should get sushi!

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:19.560
McDonald's would then you'd get like you'd get like the imitation crab wrapped

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:27.160
up in cabbage instead of nori and an old bun to replace the rice if you if you

02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:32.400
did get rice crackers and soak them in water not it will not get the big rice

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:35.520
cakes and soak them in water and then wrap those around a piece of imitation

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:41.520
crab meat and cover it in cabbage I'm being told to look at a Gran Turismo

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:44.280
Vise City story I apparently missed that was going on in the intro.

02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:48.840
Gran Turismo, Vise City, shit! You fucker, you're going faster, man! We're gonna kill

02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.040
you! Okay, SoCalKick says he was watching Channel

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.880
4, and this was the explanation of Grand Theft Auto Vise City. Did I say Grand Theft Auto?

02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:57.120
I'm sorry. Grand Theft Auto Vise City.

02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:58.960
Oh yeah, that's right, there was supposed to be a news report on that.

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.600
Yes, on Channel 4, they said, in the new Grand Theft Auto Vise City, players must beat women,

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.600
kill police, and have sex with prostitutes to progress in the game.

02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.520
Uh, no. Kill police, yes.

02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:11.520
Oh, that's optional.

02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:12.520
Cop killer!

02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:18.520
That's optional? I mean, I always just, you know, I fire lots of rockets and watch people explode.

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:21.520
This is how much I actually play PlayStation games, by the way.

02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:26.520
Yeah, well, well, gee, that's not, like, you know, a one-sided opinion there.

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:29.520
Well, you have to do this to, you know, want, first off...

02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:31.520
If you want the bonus stage, maybe.

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.520
Oh, first off, it's a complete lie.

02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:37.520
Okay, complete lie right there, just totally slandering the game right there.

02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.440
right there. Stupid bastards. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. No matter what they say, in

02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:47.160
fact, yeah, it's going to give them more ratings and more, you know, people are, oh, cool,

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.120
that game looks like fun and it's going to sell more copies. It was the highest selling,

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:56.920
highest grossing game last year, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3, so now this time it's

02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:02.280
going to be even better. And it has a story line. It has to do with a drug deal that went

02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:08.360
bad. And you have to go kill the people that stole your money.

02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:11.440
Well thank you. Bitch better have my money.

02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.600
Alright let's shift gears here because I have another topic I'd like to talk about.

02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:18.560
And this is kind of a half a few of the week, kind of like a half

02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.080
let's talk about this interesting topic. Jamie and I yesterday

02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:26.980
we went on a little road trip and we went over to Fry's. Remember we went to Fry's?

02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:30.560
And what did we see at Fry's but

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:34.280
DDR Max USA being played on a giant screen TV over there.

02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:37.280
That guy who played again and again and again and again.

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.280
Exactly.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.280
That's my FU of the Week.

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:40.780
Well, one of my FU's things.

02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:44.760
We wanted to play, even though Jamie and I can play at home, you know, of course, how

02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:47.920
often do we get to play DDR Max USA in front of a crowd of strangers, you know?

02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.680
We wanted to show off a little bit, you know, our egos, stroke our egos a little.

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:54.280
I almost got the manager.

02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:56.640
But these guys just kept playing over and over and over again.

02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:57.640
One of them was an employee.

02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.640
One of them was an employee?

02:35:58.640 --> 02:35:59.640
Seriously?

02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:05.160
to getting the manager to have that guy kicked off because, and the thing is the people who

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:07.520
know me know that I will do this.

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:08.520
You were there when I've gotten...

02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:09.520
Jamie, don't fuck around.

02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:10.520
Yeah.

02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:15.800
The thing is, I worked in customer service, okay, for two years.

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:21.680
There's no excuse for bad customer service, and keep in mind this, for every one person

02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.800
who calls in or can complain or does a physical complaint, there are eight more people who

02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:30.400
who are displeased. And each of these people will go and tell more people. The thing is

02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:35.500
if we had more activists in the world, stuff would change. And so I think that that's my

02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:38.400
part in trying to make things a little bit better.

02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:42.560
So Jamie and I didn't get to play Max in front of a bunch of strangers and we cry.

02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:44.400
I had a sniff.

02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:49.480
But it was kind of interesting how Fries has really been promoting DDR around here, especially.

02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:50.480
I did.

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:53.560
Because I literally, we watched, what, like two or three people, at least I noticed this.

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:55.340
I didn't really say anything to you about it.

02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:59.860
But I saw like two or three people, not the ones playing the game, but like families picking

02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:04.440
up DDR and a dance pad, like walking out there, and the employees, this is kind of smart,

02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:08.120
they did have an employee kind of stationed near the DDR watching the people play, apparently

02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:11.940
not keeping very good track, but watching the people play, and then when parents would

02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:15.880
kind of look at it curiously, would go up and talk to them about DDR, and suddenly they're

02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:20.280
walking out of there with a copy of Max USA, and one of them was walking out with a PlayStation

02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:21.280
2.

02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:24.240
My boss bought economics for herself.

02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:27.840
Make sure that you buy your games at Gamestop, thank you.

02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:28.840
Yes.

02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:30.720
Buy them at Gamestop.

02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.840
Reserve your games at the Gamestop in Rancho Cordova.

02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:36.880
Jamie's trying to get a little bit of business there.

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:37.880
For my man.

02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:38.880
Yes.

02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:39.960
Let me know.

02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:46.400
I guess that's a really great way to promote DDR, it's too bad more stores don't do that.

02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:51.000
I also did find another couple of cool things at Fry's, speaking of our little trip to Fry's.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Okay.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.840
my favorite artist ever I didn't think that any of the stuff was released in

02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:02.120
the US and I was wrong because I found three DJ crush CDs at fries that makes

02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:06.880
me happy and I saw the super ghetto cheap CD burners that made me happy yep

02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:13.120
they were really cheap yep okay so that was our fry story and that's about it

02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:19.640
Oh Loki has something to share damn you fries and making me spend money I go

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:26.040
there with Nintendo buying one thing and I walk out with eight things. I hate you! Being

02:38:26.040 --> 02:38:31.200
so cheap! I got my man a really cool birthday present. And by the way, we need to give,

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:37.120
even though he's like not listening and stuff, I have to give a happy birthday to my fiance

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:43.080
Dan, because he's absolutely awesome. Awww. Yeah, Nona, if ever you see him online, he's

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:49.520
either online as Neo Strider, he used to run the Neo Strider Strider Zone, and he also

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.520
And I hope he's not listening because I just told him what day President was.

02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:55.520
You don't need another voice

02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:02.520
If I'm in another world, you can't see another world

02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:32.520
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:43.240
to the music.

02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:48.280
You are back and it's funny in the chat room they're talking about this gacked another

02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:53.680
world sounds just like the Josie and the Pussycat song Three Small Words and they're absolutely

02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:57.320
right because that wracked my brain for an entire day one time.

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.320
It's okay, but...

02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.320
What song does it sound like?

02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:00.320
But it's better.

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:02.280
Yeah, I like Another World a lot.

02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:03.600
I mean, and it is different.

02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.600
The chorus is a lot different.

02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:05.600
We actually did play the gakta version.

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:06.600
The guitar is just very similar.

02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:07.600
The guitar is very similar.

02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:11.200
We actually did play the gakta version, by the way, which is the only good one that exists.

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:15.240
I was supposed to relay a message to Loki from SoCal Kicks, but I lost it, so retype

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:18.880
that in the chatroom, SoCal, and I'll get that.

02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:22.360
No, I don't think it was more work.

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:27.360
I think it was something more about Grand Theft Auto.

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:32.080
All local news sucks because they're stupid and uninformed about anything current, especially

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:33.720
anything that has to do with gaming.

02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:43.760
They're like, with those crazy kids and their games, they're so stupid.

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:44.760
That was special.

02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:48.280
Well, we're coming down to the home stretch of the show, this three hour tour that we've

02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:49.280
got going here.

02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.320
Is there any other topics that somebody wanted to discuss here tonight, while we still have

02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:55.600
time I think we've got everything that I want to set things on fire you want to

02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:02.200
set things on fire yes Black Lab set himself on fire tonight after that mr.

02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:06.920
stanky bit oh that's right but I miss it no actually we are going to uh as soon

02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:09.780
as the show is over we're going on the road we're going over to Davis actually

02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:12.880
to go pick up some boba correct Black Lab needs to meet us there yes he does

02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:17.720
and towels not listening right now I cry so he can't meet us but I'll call him

02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:18.720
Maybe he'll...

02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:23.080
Yeah, Cal's not listening and that's sad.

02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:26.480
Why is vidpower suggesting Animal Crossing Vice City?

02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:27.480
No.

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:30.120
That would be pretty funny though.

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.600
We could like, you know, take our gas from Mallory.

02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:34.640
I'd be able to shoot Mallory finally.

02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:35.640
I like Mallory.

02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:37.800
I could pop a cap in her ass.

02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:39.120
I like Mallory.

02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:42.560
Mallory gives me stuff all the time.

02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:45.040
That would be crazy if Grandpa thought of Vice City.

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.840
That's okay because I like puddles and you don't like her.

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:51.160
The network version on the internet.

02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:56.160
I'm going to be getting that bug net out and just beating the shit out of puddles.

02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:58.760
Anyway, sorry Loki, yes?

02:46:58.760 --> 02:46:59.760
Sorry.

02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:00.760
Oh, never mind.

02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:04.680
I don't want to talk about my online Grand Theft Auto version anymore because that would

02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:05.680
be cool.

02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.960
Except it would be kind of crazy watching hundreds of people running around with rocket

02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:10.560
launchers trying to kill each other.

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.160
It'd be like one giant version of Unreal or Quake or something.

02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:18.240
Black Lab wants to point out that the Boba at Boba, Max is broken.

02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:19.480
We're going there for Boba.

02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:20.480
Still worth a trip.

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:21.480
All right, we're going there for Boba.

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:22.480
That's fine.

02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:23.480
We're still coming.

02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.480
All right.

02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:26.800
Now this is what SoCalCakes wanted to tell you.

02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:28.280
Loki, that's what they do.

02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.480
Do you even know why every supermarket has milk in the back?

02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:33.500
It's just like a mental thing.

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:36.040
Most people just go to a supermarket often just for milk.

02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:39.880
If it's in the back, they have to go all the way to the back and then for some reason to

02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:40.880
pick up other things.

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:46.040
Yeah, that's because they, they, you know, arrange supermarkets and stuff to promote

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.120
buying, duh, but, I mean, that has nothing to do with the fact that, you know, they're

02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:54.120
saying that the game is, you know, I don't know.

02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.200
Oh yeah, talking about Fries, yeah.

02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.200
Oh.

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.400
I think, I don't know what that was exactly in reference to.

02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.400
Oh, Fries.

02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:01.400
Yeah, Fries is like a giant maze.

02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.600
It's like a giant hedge maze that you have to walk through just to get to the checkout

02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:05.600
counter.

02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:07.840
Giant hedge maze, that's all you have to remember.

02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:17.840
It's not the fact that they arrange stuff like that, it's just the fact that they're so cheap, so cheap that you can't resist, but the problem is they're all mail-in rebates, no!

02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:26.840
But yeah, I love their stuff, I love buying computer stuff, and that's kind of a bad thing. I should stop spending, but that never happens. Never ever.

02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:33.840
And I'm still waiting on my bid on eBay for my PS2 and my Japanese PlayStation 2, so I'll probably have one. Yay!

02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.840
What exactly are you going to play on it?

02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.840
Well, the first thing I'm going to be doing is getting DDR Max 2 when that comes out.

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.840
So, um, you know, I can rip everything from that and whatnot.

02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:51.840
But, um, I'm also, one of the first games I'm getting, which I'm also bidding on, is Para Para Para.

02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:53.840
I'm not going to...

02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:57.840
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:20.840
Yeah, but there's a bunch of other games. You guys are trying to get me into Beatmania 2DX, and I'm thinking that's an expensive investment for something I'm not too excited to be playing, but I don't know. There's also the Drummania drum. I wanted to get the drumset for that and maybe Drummania or something. I don't know.

02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:27.840
If you get Dramania, you can bring it to my house and play Session with all my guitar freaks, because I have the PS2 ones.

02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:30.840
Session mode is so cool. Yeah.

02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.840
Being told that Grand Theft Auto crime online is said to be real.

02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.840
Uh-oh! Hide your children!

02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.840
And Loki, you don't want Para Para, it gets boring in three days.

02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.840
Actually, I'm not sure if he's talking about Para Dramania, but he's saying, you don't want it, it gets boring in three days, that's DCV.

02:49:47.840 --> 02:50:07.840
Well, I know that, duh. I don't play games like after three games anyways. Another reason why I'd want, you know, Para Para is just for the controller, because I get to use it with Step Maniac. Oh yeah, I get to put some crazy shit in there. Basically, it'd be like a really tripped out version of Dance Maniacs. It'll have to do for now until I-

02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:08.840
He is talking about Para.

02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.840
Yeah. It'll have to do until I get, like, you know, Dance Maniacs stuff.

02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:14.840
Ooh.

02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:18.840
Now he's thinking, how can I make a custom dance maniacs controller?

02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:21.840
Well, actually, I could with the Para Para controller.

02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:23.840
Yes, you could.

02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:26.840
The Para Para Pancakes of Pinkness.

02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:29.840
No, no, no, no, no, you got the name wrong.

02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:30.840
I'm sorry.

02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:31.840
The Pink Biscuits of Death.

02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:32.840
The Pink Biscuits of Death.

02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:34.840
I like pink pancakes.

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.840
They're too big to be pancakes.

02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:38.840
They're fat pancakes.

02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:41.840
Well, they were saying also that I should get, what was it,

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.680
Kingdom Hearts International when that comes out, and Final Fantasy International, hell

02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.240
I can get Final Fantasy XI right now I guess, I don't know why I'd want to, but.

02:50:51.240 --> 02:51:00.240
Oh hey, Swiftrock is offering to give away his Para Para for a Milpitas Golf Land token.

02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:02.240
Okay.

02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:04.240
Okay.

02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:11.760
Well, go ahead and email the show at orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com and we'll forward that on the Loki

02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:55.760
By the way, MakeEditGetPorn is still on, and yeah, I haven't really thought of a date yet that I want to judge everything. I'm just being lazy, so in the meantime, make edits for anything that's on Max USA.

02:51:55.760 --> 02:52:06.760
And I don't care how you make it, just get me a step chart or edit file or DWI or step media file somehow, and yeah, and I'll enter it in.

02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:07.760
You can do it!

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:09.760
And you can get porn!

02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:17.820

02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:37.220
I don't know if she were to be, I don't know, gagged somehow.

02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:40.220
I'll let your mind do the work.

02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:43.220
You got some Para-Paradise you can gag her with?

02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:46.220
I got a pink biscuit for you.

02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:48.220
Stick the mic closer.

02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:49.220
That's right.

02:52:49.220 --> 02:52:50.220
Oh yeah.

02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:52.220
You know you like it.

02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:56.220
Anyway, we're getting close to the end of the show here, so I thought I'd go around

02:52:56.220 --> 02:52:58.220
and get everybody's final thoughts of the day.

02:52:58.220 --> 02:53:00.220
Dude met you at one sick fuck.

02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:02.540
That's Jamie's final thought is mad as a sick fuck

02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:06.720
Yeah

02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:10.180
Correct Loki your final thought for the day

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:19.420
No, I'm I'm tired you're tired it's kendo all right all right my bitches will do anything

02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:22.300
Okay, well, maybe not that

02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:39.700
The final thought of the day is, run away, run away, run, run, far away, and then run

02:53:39.700 --> 02:53:40.700
back.

02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:41.700
What?

02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:43.700
That was great.

02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:47.460
That was great.

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:49.020
I didn't get it.

02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:51.660
Gendo, are you a pimp?

02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:54.660
No!

02:53:54.660 --> 02:53:55.660
That didn't do anything!

02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:59.660
I know, I just like that song.

02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:02.660
Attention Kmart Shoppers!

02:54:02.660 --> 02:54:04.660
Attention Kmart Shoppers!

02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:07.660
This is Gendo!

02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:13.660
Please report to my office for breast inspection!

02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:16.660
Damn it, I hate this part!

02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:19.660
Oh baby!

02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:20.660
Oh, dear.

02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:26.460
Where Shinji's in front of the elevator and the elevator opens and it's the Gendo music

02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:28.940
and then it closes and the music goes away.

02:54:28.940 --> 02:54:36.100
We're talking about an anime parody of Evangelion called Evangelion Re-Death.

02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:37.960
It's completely on crack.

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:41.300
That's where the it's Gendo line comes from in the intro.

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:42.300
Yay.

02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:45.020
And we're just quoting it because we can.

02:54:45.020 --> 02:54:46.020
We're nerds.

02:54:46.020 --> 02:55:03.020
The best one has to be Fanboy Bebop. That is so funny. It's so funny. It starts off the whole thing and shows this ship and it shows his anime collection and it says Sailor Moon and stuff. And it's all hentai.

02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:11.020
And it shows this long hallway full of videos and it's all hentai. It's hilarious. Definitely watch it.

02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:17.920
What else I have on that tape is jubei powers international man of intercourse it sucks, but I love the part with the looping ninjas

02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:23.220
That part was funny the the looped animation of the ninja running in it

02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:28.420
With the 70s porn music JB wanted to share something with us all

02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:32.740
JB wanted to share this with us all Polteri calm

02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:38.440
Is this the same one is it really I think it might be yeah under the events section

02:55:38.440 --> 02:56:02.040
you'll find information regarding different performances in and around Japan.

02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:05.200
Apollo was born in Australia in a musical family with his famous opera singer mother

02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:08.800
and a highly skilled classical guitarist brother. She began vocal training at the age of six

02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:11.200
and lived in France until the age of sixteen.

02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:18.200
Where she was then sold to slave trader Naoki. Where she became his sex slash singing.

02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:25.200
Oh she's married! It says does my wedding count under events. We might have to go with

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.400
this a little more next week. It doesn't say anything about Bamani I see.

02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.680
Oh here we go, Love Again Tonight's in there.

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:34.400
Hey, well didn't you hear, Naoki's Naoki Terry now?

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:37.240
He took her name.

02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:39.980
Oh, I just clicked on email and now it's trying to get me...

02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:42.980
Oh, I can send her an email!

02:56:42.980 --> 02:56:44.640
Paula at PaulaTerry.com

02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:48.440
Dude, we need to send her an email and get her to listen to the show.

02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:50.360

02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:55.560
Yeah, thank you for reading my spam.

And on that note, I do believe it's time to end the show.

02:57:14.100 --> 02:57:15.100
Oh, did I get everybody's final thought?

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:16.980
I got Bradley's final thought, yes?

02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:17.980
Okay.

02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:21.340
My final thought is, I finally got a date, now I just need sex.

02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:22.340
That's my final thought.

02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:23.340
