138131	139132	November 10th of 2002.
139192	141653	Hee hee, time for a dive.
142753	145495	Oh, it's been a long-ass weekend, that's all I have to say.
146456	150659	You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most shafted radio station of all things Bimani.
151039	153141	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
153661	157624	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
157684	158845	You know her better as DarkSakura.
159045	160146	I'm more on the funny part.
161947	162628	No comment.
162668	165650	They're coming to take me away, ha-ha, they're coming to take me away.
166317	168761	Say hello also to our newest co-host.
169322	171705	Although he has been here since the beginning, he's still the noob.
171785	173528	Say hello to Loki, everybody.
174750	175771	And that's it.
175831	177153	It's just the three of us tonight.
177213	178395	Dave couldn't get a ride here.
178435	181259	He was begging me for one about an hour before the show started.
181940	186343	Yeah, he's probably at home with my copy of the freaking sign, that bastard.
187003	188964	Oh, do you have some hate mail for Dave?
189284	190905	Well, let's wait until the FU's of the week.
191766	192126	Okay.
194487	198109	We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a really quick break.
198149	199990	It's as if we didn't talk to tons of people before.
200210	200470	I know.
201851	204393	If you can't tell, my throat's slightly going today.
204773	206974	And no, it's not from anything dirty.
207054	208255	You sick bastards.
210077	211958	Anyway, we've got a lot of big announcements.
211998	226727	We've got local news about the big tournament we had yesterday, but that includes, like everything, we've got some show news, including big changes coming next week, coming to our website, I think, tonight.
227147	230709	As long as that song doesn't play, we can talk about changes.
230749	231930	Yeah, we won't play the song changes.
231970	232791	You have nothing to worry about.
233511	235973	Although, and then an F you to myself.
237634	240876	is also coming up later, because I did something very, very bad yesterday.
240896	241457	Uh-oh.
241557	243298	Very, very bad and naughty.
244819	247401	I was a naughty boy.
248542	249223	Not by you, honey.
250003	253045	Dave is claiming he hasn't taken my sign, so I will have to find it.
253386	253686	Uh-oh.
253766	254326	Oh, never mind.
254366	255267	Then Dave's off the hook.
255848	258450	He just got the blame because he left, and he was easy to blame.
258530	260271	Anyway, it was all DDR Mike.
260351	261032	He blamed you.
261152	262393	He pointed the finger at you.
263834	264434	Which sign?
264474	264955	Was it the...
265875	286802	Movie, Signs, Signs, Noel Gibson, M. Night Shyamalan Cause Loki gets the hook up and gets the promo stuff So he has a promo of Signs Anyway, let's take a quick break We're gonna play the full remix version of one of the new Max USA License tunes This is a speed remix of Venus with You Leave Me Alone here on Orange Lounge Radio
293241	294542	VOG Network VOG Network

551179	552265	Thank you for watching!
619053	624820	Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.
628285	631168	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
632530	634933	You know what?
636844	640545	Mel cracking up in the car today because I pointed out something to him that I noticed from day one.
640645	641966	The one and only Mel B, right?
641986	642066	Yes.
642086	642826	Or are we talking Melody?
642966	643647	Mel B. All right.
644227	646868	The QQQ sounds like ducks.
650289	650729	Seriously.
650749	654971	If you're one of the breaks, we'll play it during the pre-show.
655491	656752	But QQQ.
657492	657712	Right.
657872	657952	Cool.
658784	660644	You want me to pull up QQQ for the folks?
660784	661885	Okay, let's listen to some QQQ.
661905	666806	Now, we're going to pull this up, and I want to take a survey from the chat room here.
666866	671067	Tell me if this does or does not sound like ducks.
671387	672747	Down to the laughter in the background.
674067	677848	Okay.
677888	681749	Does it sound like a... See?
681769	682609	It sounds like ducks.
684813	687894	Actually, it sounds like the music that they play in the electric parade at Disneyland.
688934	691075	It's like a spiced up version of the chicken dance.
692755	694876	No, I think it sounds like ducks, but it doesn't sound like chickens.
694956	695696	Sharon, what do you think?
695736	696736	It's not like ducks, am I right?
696756	696956	Say yes.
703909	705331	They said work, work, work.
705771	707873	They must be a little bit behind.
707973	709154	Yay, there is the clown.
709695	710916	Demon child laughter.
712317	713779	Our chat room always full of clowns.
718168	720569	or they're comparing it to the dying giraffe noise.
725332	734818	That was the Ultimate Tack pre-show, by the way, that you heard before we went live just now with every, I think, just damn near every Tack song from DDR and 2DX and then some.
734898	737700	I took out Stoic on purpose.
738000	739301	What do you have against Stoic?
739741	740182	Boring.
741022	742643	Stoic isn't a highlight for me either.
742663	743324	Kind of a boring video.
743344	743584	Yeah.
743684	743944	Yeah.
746879	748101	It's a stripped down holic.
749142	750063	And holic is awesome.
750183	752506	Take everything good out of holic and then you get stoic.
753227	755950	Yeah, that's your expression after listening to it.
756330	758552	You're like, just flat and stoic.
760932	763694	Oh, lots of big news.
763734	763974	I know.
764595	766656	Today is just one big sigh, isn't it?
766876	768477	I slept 13 and a half hours.
768537	769458	Did you really?
769718	770219	Yes, I did.
770279	771319	I came home and took Vicodin.
771679	775102	Well, let's fill everyone in that may have missed it.
776142	780946	You know, we are an international show, Orange Lounge Radio, for the international Bomani community.
780966	782407	Konnichiwa!
783007	787650	But here in Sacramento, where we're based, as you probably may or may not know, in Northern California, we're based out of Sacramento.
787670	789451	We had a huge tournament yesterday.
789872	790312	Shaft.
790832	794974	So we were all a big part of this, and we're all tired as fuck.
795275	801798	And if any of you guys might have been tuned in for our live broadcast, Orange Lounge did broadcast the whole day live from Shaft.
801838	807421	We cut it off around Improv Freestyle because it was starting to, yeah.
809683	812004	There's only so much you can talk about at a tournament.
812224	815486	I have to apologize for all those who did listen to the live broadcast.
816626	816746	Ugh.
818167	821249	I hope you never have to be subjected to something that horrible ever again.
836420	838961	I'm going to get some clips of Loki going insane, but there were some great moments.
840001	850524	All I know is that I was standing on the Max 2 machine, and I looked over in the corner, and they'd taken the microphone, some of the folks that were helping us out, and drug it out the window.
850645	852505	Yeah, it was Evan that did that.
852865	855626	I'm definitely going to talk about Evan a little bit here, too, because he did a great job.
856166	864689	And the microphone was out the window, and Jahi was holding onto it, and I know this isn't going to translate well to radio, but he was standing there, and he's just going like this.
866238	870360	I'm looking like he's ranting about something and I'm like, there's quality radio going on in the corner right now.
870980	872801	And I'm like, I so wish I could be there right now.
873201	881144	But yes, a big, big thank you to everybody that helped out with that live broadcast yesterday because Jamie was so busy with tournament things.
881344	882385	I was so busy with tournament things.
882725	886226	We let the noob, Loki, kind of take the brunt of a lot of that towards the beginning.
886246	887207	I was all over the place.
887427	888027	Towards the beginning.
888047	889468	But he did a fabulous job.
889508	891689	I kept going in the back room and...
892749	904473	Capt, just hearing the interviews going one after another, interviewing practically everybody who did an accuracy attack, and I just remember seeing a microphone in my face a few times going, huh?
905233	906634	Oh, we're live.
907523	909904	I have to go over here now.
909924	910324	Bye.
910644	914225	Just especially a big thank you to everybody that helped out with that.
914685	915605	Loki, of course.
916046	921327	Brad, Irene, JB, 23M, Jahi.
921947	922968	Just everybody that helped out.
923028	926809	And a big, big thank you to Evan because he got really creative with it.
927189	929350	Evan was born for Internet Radio.
929830	931530	Can we have some Flyboys over here?
931810	933351	Evan is a fucking riot.
934391	935492	I got judged.
935552	939736	He sat at the table for a little while and saw some forms.
939976	944539	That's one contributing factor to how you guys ran out during Improv Freestyle, but that's okay.
944559	945100	It was worth it.
945700	949203	He judged me, and he wrote down on this thing, Nice flaming blue shirt.
950044	951245	Just all this funny stuff.
951705	952646	Evan cracks me up.
952746	957490	I wish he could have been there the whole day, just to kind of ease the tension.
957530	959291	I'm going to have to get him on the show.
959571	960232	He's not...
960832	962793	He plays Bomani, I think.
962873	969156	He's kind of a closet Bomani fan, but he's maybe played it once or twice, but he wouldn't be able to talk about it like we do.
969256	971877	But he's still funny, so I'll have to get him on here sometime.
971897	974298	I think he might be listening, so hello, Evan, if you're listening.
974318	975619	We love you.
975699	983983	He had to kind of play relief because I was very sick yesterday at the same time doing the radio show, as anyone that listened realized.
984723	986505	And, um, I was losing my voice.
987006	989789	In fact, I had pretty much lost my voice by the end of the day.
990330	997538	And so, I was talking on the radio, trying to think of... It was pretty much me being sick and all, like, just miserable.
998098	1000781	Just ranting on about whatever came to mind.
1000801	1004025	Even though it probably wasn't incoherent at parts, but, um...
1005206	1005507	Go Donut!
1021676	1024777	Have you ever seen a beautiful, beautiful sunset?
1025597	1027718	And a flamingo is flying across the sunset.
1027998	1031479	Also, it's holding a rose in its beak and a painting in its paws.
1032240	1033520	Or claws, I guess.
1034200	1035301	Also, you're drunk.
1036261	1037942	Another deep thought by Jack Handy.
1039082	1039842	That was beautiful.
1040703	1041463	I have had a cry.
1041563	1041983	Thank you.
1045355	1052060	I had three of them somewhere and I lost them all because I suck.
1053582	1057045	I remember one day we would go visit my Uncle Caveman.
1057325	1059567	We called him Uncle Caveman because he lived in a cave.
1060027	1061849	And one day he would eat one of us.
1062209	1063590	Later on we found out he was a bear.
1067193	1069996	The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth.
1070600	1077682	I think my favorite deep thought of all time was, it's true that every time you hear a bell ring, an angel gets its wings.
1078162	1082744	But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set on fire.
1090060	1095307	So anyway, yes, Shaft, the big topic, it's weighing heavily on our minds.
1095888	1097030	No, wait, you're sitting on my face.
1097150	1101916	Now, a funny thing to tell a child is that when it rains, God is crying, probably because of something you did.
1104580	1106483	Then there was one about how Disneyland burnt down.
1111808	1116552	I like to play jokes on my little cousins.
1129182	1132424	I'd like to play jokes on little children, so I took my leave.
1132765	1133805	But it was getting pretty late.
1134806	1136427	Yeah, we pieced it together in there somewhere.
1136887	1137448	Yes, Shaft.
1138128	1139009	Deep fried Twinkies.
1139029	1139629	Shut your mouth.
1139729	1140750	Deep fried Twinkies.
1140830	1141470	Oh my god.
1141550	1145493	What DDR tournament ever has deep fried Twinkies?
1145533	1152097	I just know that we had the whole RTF versus Step Squad Twinkie eat out.
1152177	1153218	Whoa, whoa.
1153578	1157521	Did you just say the RTF Step Squad Twinkie eat out?
1160403	1161404	I didn't mean it that way.
1161945	1162685	My apologies.
1163666	1169591	I don't know, apparently there was some sort of little mini... I think it was just teasing.
1170172	1170592	Shut up.
1170832	1171993	Last week on Orange Lounge.
1173474	1174956	If you use that, I'm going to kick you.
1176431	1187287	No, but we were, basically it was just like, everyone was talking about the heart attack they were going to get, and then I hear something coming from a Kyoki saying, I just took one for Step Squad.
1187687	1188489	Took one what?
1188769	1189230	Twinkie?
1192054	1192675	It was funny.
1193254	1196497	And there was actually a guy there named Mr. Twinkie, which was pretty cool.
1196998	1198439	Sir Twinkie, I'm sorry, Sir Twinkie.
1198720	1200181	I met Sir Twinkie's mom, she was nice.
1200582	1201162	Oh, very cool.
1201422	1203525	There were some people that came in from out of town.
1203565	1206107	I know there was a caravan that came in from Reno, a bunch from the Bay.
1206127	1209331	Biggest thanks to Fury for flying out from Omaha.
1209431	1211593	Oh my lord, Omaha in the house.
1212354	1215377	And some SoCal, I believe there were some ER Maniacs folks from SoCal.
1216037	1221799	And my apologies for constantly saying on the radio that he is from Kansas, because I was sick and out of it.
1222539	1224400	I heard Omaha saying, Kansas?
1225320	1225821	Kansas?
1225981	1226661	Nebraska!
1227061	1228442	We're Californian, Warrior Grant, thank you.
1228462	1231143	I ain't Californian, originally.
1233423	1234744	I know my states, yo.
1236444	1237645	What else about Shaft yesterday?
1237665	1238485	There's so much to talk about.
1238705	1240026	Let's talk about the winning freestyle routines.
1240046	1241186	They're all a freestyle, really.
1241686	1243307	Which I saw three pieces of.
1244438	1246320	You didn't get to see that much of Freestyle, huh?
1246340	1247580	No, I was working.
1249122	1250643	Some of us don't get to be the MC.
1251283	1252224	I'm sorry, dear.
1253585	1255646	What did you think about a lot of this stuff?
1255706	1257247	I definitely have my favorites.
1257267	1258088	What were some of your favorites?
1258892	1270181	Um, you know, I'd have to, well, there's some really interesting ones and I'm sure we can go into a little bit later about how unorthodox a few of the, uh, rigs we had going there were.
1270662	1272063	Oh my god, yes, we'll get into that.
1272423	1280710	Um, but definitely, um, I'd have to say my two favorites, you know, obviously first and second place, uh, Tranpower, you know, his routine was awesome.
1281110	1282491	I only got to see that from distance.
1282511	1285654	I was playing Max 2 Guard during that time, so I only got to see it from distance.
1285674	1289618	There were too many people blocking the way, so I only saw the top half of him, like his head bobbing up and down.
1289698	1291299	It was very good.
1292260	1292741	I did see it.
1292761	1293701	It was so smooth.
1293721	1294402	It was really nice.
1294482	1295043	It was very good.
1295103	1296764	He is an awesome freestyler.
1297305	1300948	Even his improv was right on.
1301148	1302029	It was great.
1302149	1303090	It looked like a routine.
1303650	1305812	It was crazy.
1305832	1313139	Then first place, you know, obviously went to Bruce Leroy and all I have to say is, man, that guy's got some funk in him.
1314571	1315932	I have one thing to say about Wendell.
1316793	1317454	Mm-mm, good.
1318114	1325962	Yeah, I was actually just about to say, and our chat room is going crazy about it right now, because Wendell and I can't remember the name of his partner.
1325982	1326723	Do you remember who it was?
1326803	1328284	I feel like an ass.
1329445	1329946	Okay, thank you.
1330006	1330586	Oh, yes, Holland.
1330626	1330967	That was it.
1331587	1337473	They did this hilarious routine to a DDR song that usually annoys a lot of people.
1341858	1349482	And basically what they did, and as the chat room's going, roast beef, roast beef, hot, hot, hot.
1349862	1356325	And basically they did this routine to this song where basically Wendell was fighting for a sandwich.
1357046	1359687	The other guy had a sandwich, Holland had a sandwich.
1359707	1362969	And just the way they were choreographed to the words was great.
1363009	1364409	That was hilarious.
1364569	1365070	I loved that.
1365930	1368211	That was one of the better routines I saw all day, I thought.
1368331	1369232	Although, really...
1370352	1378156	Every routine, I mean, I didn't, now, keep in mind I didn't get to stick around for Improv Freestyle, but every routine I saw that day was great.
1378436	1379036	It really was.
1379556	1391782	Now, to point out some of the more hilarious routines, or I don't even know if we can call them routines, there was one that's, I don't even know who was doing it because there ended up being like six or seven people on the stage when it happened.
1392262	1396704	It's for Twilight Zone where they're doing the Mortal Kombat rendition there.
1396844	1397704	That was hilarious.
1397724	1399165	The Goro made that.
1399625	1403467	The Goro thing, when they were stomping on the ground, that was the shit.
1403547	1404267	That was funny.
1404467	1414192	Also, notably, probably the most eyebrow-raising routine of the evening was about ten people all in the routine area doing It's Raining Men.
1415072	1424757	And Irene, the rice princess, is a frequent contributor to this show, and also I think one of the world's only holders of an Orange Lounge t-shirt, which we don't even have, as host of the show.
1425037	1427838	She just was up there singing, and she had her Flyboys on.
1428218	1430959	Well, yes, DDRholic, Anita, was up there.
1430979	1434500	I think Anita was doing the actual dancing so they wouldn't fail.
1436180	1438861	And then Irene was just singing, and then they had Flyboys.
1438921	1443042	And if you'd heard Evan saying earlier in the evening, I need some Flyboys!
1443322	1444602	We need to get some Flyboys!
1444662	1450203	And, of course, the first two people to speak up, Sunia and Rai Rai, two cute younger girls, are all, We'll do it!
1450703	1451564	Like, you're not a boy!
1451704	1452244	That's okay!
1453644	1454164	It was great.
1454645	1464210	I mean, that was kind of a very eyebrow-raising routine where a lot of people were just like... I just remember walking by the machine and seeing Bruce Leroy with his hands in the air doing the swish.
1464651	1465952	Swish.
1465972	1468093	Like he shot the perfect free throw.
1468113	1470734	That was... Bruce's routine, really, was swish.
1470975	1472816	And that guy has come a long way.
1472856	1474397	I did see a routine... He was wearing orange.
1474417	1474817	The one...
1475217	1478919	The one tournament I ever was a freestyle judge at was an old Sac State tournament.
1479179	1485982	And this was before, like, Hypnotix and Bruce Lee were really well known as freestylers throughout the scene, and they were both there, and they did excellent jobs.
1486322	1486522	Yes.
1487042	1487262	So.
1488543	1490524	Very good.
1490664	1498227	I did see a little bit of the improv, and there was a little bit of what I saw was good.
1500543	1505746	Improv, by the way, was a last minute addition to Shaft because we just wanted to keep it going.
1508567	1512329	We had a few hiccups with the tourney, which we'll come to in my fuckies of the week.
1513169	1515531	But everything seemed to go pretty good.
1515651	1520053	And by the way, I have to say right now, a big congratulations to Orange Beanie.
1521274	1523835	for making, in his first tournament, fourth place.
1524096	1530100	Yeah, and we're probably playing favorites because he's a Sacramento kid, but you know, we gotta show some Sacto love.
1530120	1539987	Yeah, even so, to come in fourth place in your first tournament is quite a... You know, Jessica and I were talking a few weeks ago about how he came up and said, oh my god, how can you perfect attack so well?
1541483	1552325	And to have him come up and do that well when only not too long ago he was looking at all of us, that right there, he gets a big pass from me.
1552965	1557686	All I've got to say is yesterday some of the most unorthodox things happened at that tournament.
1558886	1561447	Let's start off with the setup.
1561507	1563527	Obviously we had fourth mix down that day.
1563547	1565267	Which I need to give a little bit of background on.
1565487	1567188	Okay, go ahead.
1567828	1568628	The security card...
1569361	1571386	I know how many people know about how a DDR machine works.
1572028	1574955	We have a CD that links up to a security card.
1575994	1579156	And the security card basically makes you able to play the disc.
1579677	1585801	Well, what it is is they needed a cartridge that will sync the security card to the disc.
1586282	1589084	And their fourth mix came pre-loaded, so they didn't have that cartridge.
1589104	1595928	Because Melody was telling me that her solo did the same thing when it had damage done to it.
1596549	1598770	So we got the card in, but they weren't synced.
1599131	1600632	So the fourth mix stayed down, so...
1601472	1612903	And another big thanks to Maple and Iguana Girl for going and modding those pads for us during the tournament so that we could have them to put on the stage instead of the fourth mix pads.
1613524	1621191	And we were going to hook up a fourth mix on the PS2, but we didn't have third mix because of transfer team.
1622322	1630990	Sorry, I was just going to say a big congratulations to everybody that was involved getting the fourth mix situation to work.
1631050	1641900	I mean, I think this is, it's probably not the first time PlayStation has been used in a big tournament like this, because I know a while back they were going to do something with the Club of Pens and OHA or something like that, and I don't know if that ever happened or not.
1641920	1644562	It was supposed to be at the last two next tournaments.
1644642	1652390	But certainly the simulator, ending up having to use Step Mania to do a third mix song just because there was just no options left.
1652910	1655272	That was downright innovative.
1656193	1658515	Let's give Matt the applause.
1660297	1673468	Yes, me and my stupid sim, you know, I just happened to have my computer with me because I was using it for, well actually it was for the after party, you know, I had my sim with me and everything and I have all the setup to, you know, rig everything together.
1673908	1681714	So we went ahead and rigged it with my TV out onto the TV and we had the pads going through my inputs and it worked great.
1681754	1687279	We had a third mix after the Game of Love working there and, you know, come to find out, you know,
1687919	1689320	Fury, his only routine was on 4th
1701587	1724878	I know, and look at this, you've got two guys, you've got one guy who came all the way from Omaha for the tournament, and then you've got Tran, who hasn't really been very active in the scene for the past four months or so, you know, he hasn't been very active, he kind of, he took a little hiatus, you know, whatever the reason be, personal, whatever, but it was good, it was great to see him back and doing a freestyle again, and it would have been so awful to have to turn these guys away, but it was really a situation that was just out of our hands, there's nothing we could do.
1724958	1725518	Turned out to work out
1725898	1727299	and it worked out awesome.
1727420	1729021	I'm so happy that all worked out.
1729101	1732304	So big props to the Fourth Mix Repair people.
1732884	1733965	I guess we'll call them that.
1735026	1735646	Yes, thank you.
1738352	1743215	It took a major hiccup and made it more of a productive burp.
1743555	1749619	And a big thank you, I believe too, and I apologize if I get this wrong, I believe it was JM3P that brought the metal pad for Match USA?
1749639	1750219	Yes, I think so.
1750279	1751140	Yes, I think so too.
1751780	1753842	Big thanks to the folks that helped that get set up.
1754222	1758665	And a thank you to the DDR Spot staff that was there doing the videos.
1758885	1764449	Big thanks to Mike Noe and AJ for taking care of filming all that for us.
1765549	1774495	Also, one of the biggest thanks goes to, of course, Konami and Jason Enos for donating DVR Max and a few t-shirts to give out for prizes.
1775295	1779117	And hopefully, maybe we'll see Jason in a tournament in the future, maybe.
1779137	1779417	Hopefully.
1779437	1780018	If we can swing it.
1780258	1780338	Yeah.
1782762	1783263	and DarkSakura.com.
1799562	1810171	One thing, after a tournament, it's probably not the best idea to have a party, honestly, because everybody is so dead and so tired, especially amongst the staff.
1810211	1814375	If we weren't all local people, maybe we'd have more energy in us, but we were just so dead.
1814435	1818298	We just all kind of sat here and watched movies and played video games.
1818338	1820920	But I do have one thing I have to say about last night.
1823322	1824363	I love the Power Glove.
1825784	1826305	It's so bad.
1829181	1832644	Yeah, well, uh, just keep your power gloves off for a pat, huh?
1833285	1833986	That's all I have to say.
1834546	1834806	Thank you.
1840333	1848158	Yeah, I was exhausted after, you know, we were supposed to be having fun stuff and I had a major headache, you know, being sick and everything.
1848718	1858964	And I came back and I set up my metal pads and all that and, of course, every time I set up my metal pads and they never worked the first time and I ended up having to dissect these damn things to get them to work.
1859324	1859724	Baby Bush Baby
1884969	1894895	Anyway, so I'm getting the sense in the chat room, and if you want to join our chat room, you're just going to join any other side IRC server, and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
1895896	1900979	I'm getting the sense that some of the people who weren't here in town are kind of left here with question marks over their head right now.
1901019	1905001	So let's talk about something a little more adaptable to folks that are listening to us international.
1905281	1909664	What were some things that we learned from the tournament that other people can take to their tournaments?
1910086	1912267	Make sure that you have backups for everything that you do.
1912287	1916410	Make sure that you have plenty of paper for the printers.
1916850	1918391	Make sure that you have one cash box.
1918431	1918511	Yes.
1919932	1920253	Make sure...
1932302	1937667	It's better to have a big staff because things will run a lot smoothly if you've got everything coordinated.
1937707	1943954	The staff this year was probably three times as big as last year and it helped immensely.
1944074	1948698	This made me feel very good to hear that lots of people came up and said that we had a very efficient staff.
1949359	1951301	Oh good, that's a very good compliment.
1953182	1959448	Make sure, you know, I thought it was a great idea that we had ElectroTal as our backup MC.
1959628	1965973	I am especially glad because after you guys added that other tournament and my voice was already starting to go, I was like, eh.
1966334	1970197	But Tal took the reins on that and, from what I understand, did a fabulous job.
1970257	1974621	Unfortunately, I had to get to the house before anybody else did to get the party started, but...
1974901	1982945	Make sure that if you're going to introduce another portion of the tournament the day of the tournament, that you have backup judges, because our judges did look pretty tired.
1983165	1983385	Yeah.
1983605	1986287	I'm sorry, guys, but thank you for sticking it out like that.
1986467	1994891	Well, I mean, we kind of expected it would be that long anyway, but a team, unfortunately, with a fourth mixed problems didn't catch on, so to speak.
1994931	1996231	So we're going to have to just do it again.
1998263	2000224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2021639	2027002	And when the judges are not just giving scores, they're giving comments and suggestions on how to better the freestyle.
2027022	2028363	And that all takes a little bit of time.
2028443	2032386	So we tried best we could to kind of get people up there and interview them.
2032446	2033887	And we had some good stuff.
2033927	2035107	We had some great in-between stuff.
2035328	2041391	Bran got up there and did a hilarious imitation of... I don't know what you'd call him, but it was funny.
2043312	2045994	And Bruce Leroy... Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
2046274	2048816	Bruce Leroy did a great improv little...
2050077	2051238	Beatbox thing, which is great.
2051358	2052640	I did hear that, that was awesome.
2052660	2053200	That was cool.
2053741	2056964	I think they did that on Orange Lounge a little later too, so that was cool too.
2057604	2059086	So, great stuff.
2060971	2066196	I, as frazzled as I was, I had a good time and I got hugged a lot.
2066216	2067517	People just grabbed me and started hugging me.
2067537	2069159	That's the best part of a tournament, isn't it?
2069219	2072442	Isn't that the best part of a tournament is just drive-by huggings?
2072702	2073443	Yes, it was nice.
2073623	2074384	It made me feel happy.
2074784	2085334	But the best comments that I could have heard the whole time that I kept hearing is that we had a good time and just hearing we had a good time and when's the next one, that made me feel really good.
2085714	2096184	The whole tournament set up actually reminded me of sort of an anime convention, because we had like, you know, it was just kind of crazy, and you had people doing their own thing everywhere, like watching movies on their laptops.
2096464	2108415	We had, you know, I was kind of bored at certain points, you know, before we actually got the tournament running, and so we had people playing DDR Max on Metal Pad, we had someone else playing Step Mania on a sim,
2108935	2121883	I had, you know, people were playing the DDR Max 2 on free play and I had my sim sitting there because we were using my computer for the PA system and I was playing through there too.
2121923	2135312	Oh, and of course, because what tournament would be, you know, without Tanook Tanook, we went ahead and played that too during one of the big breaks and also played one of those, ah shit, I can't remember the artist's,
2136152	2137673	You know, we played B4U.
2138273	2139054	What was it?
2141015	2141335	Who?
2141655	2143517	Kutu, I forget what it's called.
2143537	2144457	Oh, Kutimu.
2144597	2146798	Kutimu, yeah, we played the Kutimu B4U.
2146818	2147339	The vocal B4U.
2148399	2149520	Which people are kind of going, huh?
2150681	2155704	And then there were the people, it's like, what was it that, um, that, uh,
2156676	2157797	was it Margaret Cho that said it?
2158197	2183796	it's like some of you laugh and some of you just smile and nod but yes, the biggest advice we could give from Sacramento to the rest of the world from what we learned this weekend make your tournament fun that's the number one priority you need to have when scheduling a tournament fun, fun, fun keep drama away from your tournament if you've got something going on behind the scenes you don't need to let the rest of the people know it as far as they need to see, things are running fine yep
2184756	2202533	and really, it wasn't, I mean, there were, sure there were things falling apart behind the scenes, I wouldn't say falling apart, but you know, just problems, but they were solved, and there was no drama, there really wasn't, at least not that I really saw, so maybe I'm just ignorant, but I didn't see any drama, which is great, so.
2203007	2210531	I think there almost was with some people that were there, but we won't make comments on those people, you know, and on any of that.
2210672	2217896	Just that I want to thank people who kept their patience, you know, with certain situations.
2218156	2218936	Poopy on drama.
2219257	2219917	Yeah, poopoo.
2220998	2221278	All right.
2221318	2221938	Piles of feces.
2222298	2227802	We are going to take a quick break, and when we come back, I'm being told that around 8 o'clock-ish...
2228622	2244405	That DSCS SoCal kicks our buddy down in SoCal who is being our HTML whore basically Because I can't seem to get our old website updated anymore because it's just over my head So he said, okay, you suck, I'm going to just do the damn site So I'm like, cool!
2244925	2254467	So he's been working very hard on it and I believe he's going to have it done tonight And we're going to look at the site on the very show And we're going to peruse it and give our feedback, our instant feedback
2255762	2277729	I'm sure we're all going to love them forever so we'll be talking about some show stuff right after the break things that you'll want to hear if you're a fan of Orange Lounge and we thank you for listening we're going to start this off with a song we heard a lot of yesterday and we just still can't get enough of it not Sugaru, don't worry no, not Sugaru, not the Accuracy Attack song how about the Freestyle song of the day, shall we?
2278489	2279029	alright, here we go
2542542	2543408	Metagame, Dirt Dirt

2579422	2584205	For an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
2585066	2591009	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
2591369	2593230	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
2593811	2598213	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
2598774	2600995	That's right, our buddy Mel B, who was...
2601275	2607762	In the studio, literally minutes before we went on Arabidive, but unfortunately they have a long trip ahead of them and couldn't really stick around.
2607782	2614188	But we thank them for being here this weekend because I know they both were helping out immensely with the tournament this weekend.
2614288	2615669	They're fun house guests.
2616690	2617752	Lots of fun to hang out with.
2617772	2618372	How'd that go?
2619513	2623217	We went to the same Mongolian barbecue place, though, I believe Friday and today.
2623237	2623758	Yeah.
2624438	2634049	Well, they just ended up crashing out last night while I was making a special banner for Wendell in a tribute to his roast beefy goodness routine.
2634069	2634430	Roast beef!
2634970	2635491	Roast beef!
2636051	2636312	Hot!
2636612	2636892	Hot!
2637173	2638154	Hot!
2638254	2638514	Anyway.
2639555	2642399	So, it was pretty good, and now I'm going to go get my taquitos.
2642779	2643879	You can go get your taquitos.
2643939	2644280	Enjoy.
2645020	2646680	I hope you enjoy those taquitos.
2647961	2649922	I'm looking at what the chat room's talking about.
2650862	2656204	And they're talking about Orange Lounge Forums, which we're going to try and have on the new site eventually.
2656244	2657925	It's not going to be there right away, but soon.
2659165	2666588	And then they're a pyro man, our resident comedian's back, talking about how he was locked in his room masturbating to a glue stick inserted into a CD.
2667628	2668749	Great, that's very nice.
2668769	2669310	Thank you for sharing.
2669990	2672333	And how he's currently expanding his pornography collection.
2672713	2673034	Beautiful.
2673714	2675496	That's always a good idea.
2675796	2676597	Gotta keep a variety.
2676817	2677859	Hooray for pornography.
2678880	2683925	Speaking of pornography, they were watching yesterday at the tournament.
2684345	2685847	Yes, we're talking about pornography, Jamie.
2686628	2687769	You missed all the good stuff.
2690311	2701136	Um, Dave's, Dave's getting pissed in the chat room, cause he brought those taquitos for the party last night, but we were so dead that nobody thought to cook them.
2701156	2702197	Thank you for my dinner, Dave.
2705979	2709661	First we don't give him a ride here, and then we eat his food.
2709721	2711241	We are such assholes.
2713482	2715263	I'm not an asshole, I'm a bitch, get it right.
2717934	2719737	Oh, God, where the fuck was I?
2721278	2722019	I don't know anymore.
2722640	2723061	I don't care.
2724823	2729248	We were talking about... Shaft?
2729408	2731471	No, we were talking about... Oh, porn!
2731491	2732512	We were talking about porn!
2734334	2735535	Dear God, how could I forget?
2735576	2736597	We were talking about pornography.
2738146	2739387	And the tournament yesterday.
2740907	2745930	At the tournament yesterday, on the little iMac, they were watching the Dirty video by Christina Aguilera.
2746390	2749611	In between... The Titanium Power Book, yes.
2749972	2751232	Watching Christina Aguilera with Dirty.
2751252	2753713	And then they were watching, I believe, the Girls Gone Wild videos.
2755254	2758216	I missed the... She made the disc for Islander.
2761750	2764271	and then Mike No took it.
2765112	2767453	Oh man, I miss the Girls Gone Wild videos.
2768474	2770375	Loki, I miss all the good shit at tournaments.
2771775	2783021	We do agree though that next time we do an Orange Lounge live broadcast from a tournament, we're going to actually go to the tournament as participants and not staff.
2783702	2787124	And then we're going to demand that we be allowed to SportsCenter.
2788064	2788865	in the back of the room.
2788885	2803918	We don't have to be in front of the machine, but in the back of the room so we can actually see the machine instead of being... See, you know, to add to the whole porn thing, I could have brought about, you know, a couple hundred tapes of Playboy videos to pass out along with the DVDs, but I thought that wouldn't be family-oriented.
2803958	2806760	No, that's not a family fun center function, unfortunately.
2807601	2811964	Now, uh, you know, maybe at a, uh, different kind of, maybe it's for the next edit contest?
2812044	2814085	Oh, it could, that should be your next edit contest.
2814145	2815926	Loki's edit contest of pornography.
2816246	2817587	Make edit get porn.
2818307	2819368	Make edit get porn.
2819628	2820149	Beautiful.
2820409	2823270	That should be like a, that should be an international thing.
2823851	2827393	I, I, that should, I would, I think Orange Lounge needs to sponsor that contest.
2828093	2829254	Make edit get porn.
2831505	2832826	Alright, you heard it here.
2833006	2833346	Alright.
2833466	2834227	I will do this.
2834907	2836208	I will do this that you ask.
2836389	2836689	Alright.
2837970	2840171	The make, edit, get porn contest.
2842133	2843494	Details coming soon.
2846416	2847557	To get those details...
2849471	2850031	Well, thank you.
2851032	2858494	To get those details, you'll want to log on to our website, which is currently being reinvented as we speak.
2859034	2860715	Your HP is tasty.
2860895	2868138	I'm waiting for the word from SoCalKicks to... Oh, you've already got a pre-registration.
2871741	2874264	I'm just waiting for the words to SoCalKicks and everything's finished.
2874985	2877367	And, um, we'll go look at the new site.
2877688	2879770	And we'll, uh... Save me some boy porn and I'll do it.
2880751	2881732	Do you have any boy porn?
2882793	2884835	Uh, not really, no.
2885096	2885436	Yeah.
2886457	2889781	But maybe there's, like, you know, guy on girl porn that actually, like, shows the guy.
2890321	2891743	I mean, well, we've got...
2892310	2916243	I know, I know for a fact they can get a hold of a ton of Playboy videos, I mean, shit, man, I, from, like, for, like, the last eight months, I have every single video that's been released, and they're all crap, I mean, they're great, but, um, no, it's just, I don't know, they have their own, like, series that's, uh, called Playboy Exposed, it's actually, like, Girls Gone Wild, except, you know, kind of even more ridiculous, but, whatever.
2916464	2916984	Completely...
2917464	2918965	Off Topic from Imani Anything.
2919065	2921246	I heard they're making a movie out of Girls Gone Wild.
2921586	2927630	But, like, it's gonna be, like, actual actresses who portray these sorority girls that end up participating in the videos.
2928110	2930391	It sounds like Porky's 3 or something.
2930871	2931952	Oh, shit, man.
2935600	2938021	It'll be bigger than Jackass, I guarantee it.
2938661	2940322	And this is inside news for everyone.
2940742	2950327	I read today on Weekly World News, okay, that Nostradamus predicted that Britney Spears is going to convert to Islam.
2950747	2953008	Nostradamus predicted it, then it must be true.
2953388	2953688	Yes.
2954148	2957550	You might want to have to dispute this rumor going on in the chat room here, Loki.
2957570	2961732	I don't know what you have to say about this, but you need to set something straight, so to speak.
2963029	2964049	I prefer his Playgirl.
2964470	2965790	I've never even seen Playgirl.
2965990	2966711	What the hell is that?
2968111	2969972	SoCalKicks just being a jerk.
2970293	2973794	No, I'm just not turned on about the fact that they don't really do anything.
2974074	2976976	All the movies are exactly the same.
2977176	2981278	They all put them in situations where they start feeling themselves up for no apparent reason.
2981318	2985240	They appear to try to have sex, but for some reason just...
2985920	2987602	Get Nowhere Near Having Sex
3007691	3011112	And this one's actually pretty sweet, but... No, we're fine.
3012172	3013872	There's no Bomani Talk tonight, just porn.
3014413	3014993	Come back later.
3015873	3017293	This one's actually pretty cool.
3017313	3020454	You've got Julia Strains in it, you know.
3020514	3021354	She's pretty famous.
3022555	3026736	And actually, Sexcore TV is a really live show that they have on Playboy TV.
3026836	3029256	It's really stupid.
3029276	3032857	It's like, my girlfriend doesn't let me go down on her.
3033325	3036527	Well, your punishment is you let him go down on you.
3036927	3039088	In my courtroom on the show right now!
3039208	3040509	And that's what happens.
3040589	3041690	It's kind of stupid, but...
3043791	3055821	And I have to add, I forget what their booth is or whatever, but it's this giant seashell bed thing that looks like something out of a Little Mermaid porno sequence or something like that.
3057203	3058023	It's the weirdest thing.
3058424	3060526	But that's definitely a good movie.
3060666	3063028	Plus I have a couple other ones that are really strange.
3063228	3066871	I just had to get it because I saw the poster for it and it was just funny.
3067672	3068713	Playmate of the Apes.
3070919	3077102	I've only ever seen two porn.
3078222	3082044	One of them was the boneheads, like the coneheads with collapsible tops.
3083144	3085265	As in inwardly collapsible, so they could use them.
3085905	3087206	And Final Thug X.
3087932	3088992	Final Fuck X's winner.
3089012	3092554	Well, okay, I have to add that these aren't true pornos, these are softcore porn.
3093154	3094174	Oh, Skinamax porn!
3094194	3095095	Yeah, Skinamax porn.
3095275	3101017	Okay, now, if you want to get some good porn, you need to definitely go with the Vivid DVDs.
3101237	3103098	Vivid DVDs are awesome.
3103418	3106279	I mean, the extras on them are worth another movie right there.
3106339	3108400	Plus, a lot of them are like a twofer.
3108620	3111901	You get one movie plus bonus features, plus another movie with bonus features, so...
3112481	3113362	www.DarkSakura.com
3127958	3129599	Oh, I know, in the Sacramento area.
3129639	3133381	I mean, in Sacramento area, I know that you can go to Video Clearance Center.
3133401	3135122	They got porn as cheap as like two bucks.
3135722	3138904	So go there and check it out, man.
3139725	3143186	You are pretty much being worshipped in the chat room right now.
3143387	3144527	And another bit money news.
3144587	3150891	That Loki knows his porno and remind me when I go to NorCal to go to Loki's.
3151371	3152632	And Loki is pornified.
3153632	3155393	And porn on talk on Orange Lounge.
3155413	3156534	I never thought I would see the day.
3157463	3158284	I have a taquito.
3158764	3159425	Do you have a taquito?
3159465	3161327	I don't know.
3162267	3174558	And then we have a comment, Porn and Orange Chicken, which, you know, yesterday at the tournament, take this back to Mamani a little bit, you brought over some Boston Market and you got a half chicken.
3174839	3175839	I got a half chicken.
3175880	3178202	You were that damn hungry, but you gave a hunk of it to Loki.
3178582	3180303	So there's Loki there sitting eating some chicken.
3180344	3181705	He says, you know what goes great with chicken?
3182492	3187622	I said grape soda, but then somebody else said porn.
3188264	3189486	Yes, I remember that.
3190488	3192231	I'm just so professional during this.
3192271	3194436	I'm having a meeting of all the judges while I'm eating chicken.
3197449	3206754	Yeah, it was hilarious because they were trying to pass me a demo of the scorecard sheet thing and my hands were all greasy and sticky from, you know, WHOA!
3207154	3208035	From the chicken!
3208335	3209896	From the goddamn chicken, okay?
3210256	3212097	The chicken was damn good.
3212257	3213798	Get him a Norelco for those palms.
3214668	3224171	Okay, but the chicken was very greasy, so, you know, obviously I was just, you know, going, uh, don't hand me that, because I don't want to touch that, and, you know, get all these grease marks all over it.
3224852	3225932	But, good chicken.
3226212	3231614	The answer that nobody did give, though, we got grape soda, we got porn, nobody said waffles.
3233706	3234687	Chicken and Waffle.
3234967	3236368	Nobody said waffles.
3236528	3236949	Shame.
3237489	3238330	I flog you all.
3239571	3241172	That was Dave who said porn and chicken.
3241212	3242533	If I don't give him credit, he'll cry.
3242553	3243233	So, let's see.
3244875	3255242	Oh, well, I have to add, since we were going to originally talk about, I believe, Showgirls that we watched last night, I have to say that Showgirls is a complete waste of time.
3255683	3262408	Sure, it's got, you know, T&A, but it's three hours long and it's got, like, a plot.
3263629	3264450	I will cut you.
3264590	3267853	Orange Lounge is great.
3268253	3273318	Showgirls is like the greatest movie ever because it is so bad.
3274078	3275800	But I like watching trainwreck cinema.
3276180	3280024	I like watching her bump and grind on people, so that was all worth it for me.
3281245	3285109	And in other Bimani news, I like DDR.
3286190	3287331	I like Beatmania.
3288487	3290988	Apparently, other people like Beat It Mania.
3293990	3294370	You know.
3295410	3296231	DDRholic.
3296711	3300052	DDRholic says, I may not be a guy, but I like porn.
3300833	3301933	Amen, sister.
3301973	3304434	We need more porn freaks in this world.
3304614	3305355	Porn is funny.
3306215	3306815	Porn is funny.
3306835	3307816	An ideal woman.
3308356	3309637	She likes porn more than I do.
3310637	3311077	Hey.
3311878	3312818	I like boy porn.
3314437	3320842	Jamie is a yaoi fanatic as she shoves her iron fist of justice into the air.
3323284	3323905	Iron fisting.
3327018	3333080	Um, and then I have to also add that, as well as my hentai collection, we're not going to go there either.
3333800	3334141	Okay.
3335101	3345745	So, just when we're starving to get a new topic, I have SoCalKicks in his typical IRC way telling me 40 times in the chatroom, line after line, that he has finished.
3346705	3350106	So, let's see what we get if we go to our website right now.
3350126	3350566	Woohoo!
3350606	3351106	Nope, not just yet.
3351146	3353927	At orangelounge.skie.cx.
3353967	3354908	We're going to go to it right now.
3354948	3355268	Here we go.
3355988	3360951	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3370746	3372747	We're gonna go browsing, we're gonna go browsing
3400788	3404091	This is pretty sick that, you know, here we are, the host of the show.
3404111	3406153	We don't know a damn thing about our own website.
3410197	3410797	All right.
3411278	3413780	Before we go to the website, we can click right here on the main page.
3413800	3414861	Let's see what we get.
3414941	3415462	Ooh.
3416923	3417804	Orange Lounge.
3417904	3420606	Welcome to the newly redesigned Orange Lounge site.
3420907	3422808	Thanks to me, SoCalKick.
3423349	3424490	Yes, thanks to you.
3426098	3429559	This site will be very easy to run to the point Rob can even update it.
3429679	3431140	Oh, I appreciate that.
3431600	3436461	For now, all pages are very under construction as Sky himself goes in and makes this site his own.
3437021	3439582	Well, you know, Jamie and Loki might want to participate too.
3439602	3440542	We're going to have pictures.
3441843	3444223	Yes, we'll have new pictures.
3444323	3445644	It actually looks like my nose.
3445684	3447184	We don't want to be supermodels anymore.
3447224	3450085	We're just going to jump in a garbage can.
3450125	3452646	I will no longer look like Barbra Streisand.
3453306	3454947	You did not look like Barbra Streisand.
3454987	3455967	The nose was.
3457068	3457728	Oh, no.
3458028	3458909	I think it looked cute.
3458929	3459689	The nose was not like that.
3459709	3460189	But that's okay.
3460550	3464592	We'll take new pics just because people want updated pictures of ourselves.
3464612	3464752	Yes.
3464812	3467473	Of ourselves in the singular.
3467913	3469534	Rob, is there something you're not telling us?
3470014	3471115	How many of you live in there?
3472095	3473356	Knock, knock!
3473396	3473756	Forty.
3474977	3475337	In a row.
3475357	3476177	Thirty-seven.
3476197	3481000	Try not to get any more personalities on your way out to the parking lot.
3482766	3485768	Uh... Let's see, let's see.
3485808	3487790	For now, be sure to listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
3487830	3488530	Yes, good point.
3488590	3489271	Be sure to listen.
3489491	3489851	Always.
3489951	3490431	Every day.
3490972	3491752	Every second.
3492813	3497876	Visit the Live 365 page for more info, and a direct link goes to the station site.
3498477	3502179	And now, if you know me well, you know I like whoring out SCK, so here goes nothing.
3502219	3508844	And then he whores out, continues to whore out, the Friday, November 15th launch date of SoCalKicks.com version 5.0.
3508944	3509084	Yes.
3509104	3509464	Beautiful.
3510045	3510465	Beautiful.
3512265	3514387	Let's see if we have anything on these different pages yet.
3516789	3518350	Oh, no, it just says under construction.
3520231	3520992	Under construction.
3521372	3522593	Oh, here's what it says for chat.
3522633	3523334	Under construction.
3523474	3523834	No, wait.
3524135	3526857	For now, I just won't make it pretty and just say what's needed.
3526877	3532161	The channel is Orange Lounge and can be found on any other irc.otherside.net server such as irc.acons.org and others.
3532521	3532942	Very nice.
3533742	3534223	Very pretty.
3534823	3535464	Oh, forums.
3537043	3538084	Under Construction, of course.
3538644	3539084	CAST!
3539864	3540525	Under Construction.
3540765	3543026	Oh, come on, SoCalKicks, I know you know who's on CAST.
3543426	3543926	That's alright.
3544006	3545507	It looks very pretty.
3546508	3547128	Uh, music.
3547948	3548408	Nothing.
3548729	3549049	Links.
3550589	3552770	Under Construction, but here's your first link.
3553131	3554671	Hey, Sackbit Monty needs to be on there.
3554731	3556872	And there's the link to SoCalKicks.
3557853	3561955	In the upcoming, we will have... Might I add, that's one giant link banner.
3563211	3565072	I'll just have to make, like, one's just as big.
3565232	3565552	It's huge!
3565632	3573756	It's like an orange dropped on a toothpick!
3574236	3580338	Wow, so the site is very pretty, and we appreciate DSCS and all his hard work.
3580999	3583560	So, a big kisses from all of us to DSCS.
3585440	3585761	And, uh...
3590607	3593349	We'll be sure you're involved in any future Twinkie eating competitions.
3595550	3597451	Yes, you two can eat out of Twinkie.
3597971	3601053	Oh, I have to scream out his slogan.
3601874	3606196	Should we scream it out in agony, ecstasy, pain?
3606296	3608017	How should we scream out his slogan?
3608738	3614801	S-C-K-A-R-B-L-I-S-H-I-S Ultimate Tack!
3616102	3617863	Evolution just now.
3617883	3618384	Alright, here we go.
3619705	3623328	SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.
3623408	3624529	That was very ingrishy.
3625089	3625389	Thank you.
3625649	3626870	It was the natural gift of love.
3629852	3630513	So there we go.
3631073	3632174	Oh, in rave style.
3632314	3633115	I like that idea.
3634416	3637758	Let's say his slogan in rave style.
3638238	3638519	Yes.
3638539	3639459	I like that idea.
3639559	3640160	Let's do that.
3640280	3640980	Let's do it that way.
3641100	3644022	I have to go find my glow sticks real fast.
3644523	3645924	Then I can come back and do this in rave style.
3645944	3647265	I don't want to know where your glow sticks are.
3649579	3651583	Oh, man, oh, did you hear, man?
3651944	3654510	SDK accomplished his ultimate evolution just now.
3654630	3655091	Blur!
3664113	3664873	Um, yeah.
3666254	3667314	I was just out of that.
3668974	3669855	Okay.
3671115	3672355	Oh, all your base style.
3672515	3673455	Okay, all your base style.
3674116	3676376	SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.
3677457	3677797	RS.
3678897	3679517	For great justice.
3680957	3681938	Move, Orange Lounge.
3689446	3694047	Anyway, let's take another quick break.
3694207	3696168	Yeah, so Rob can go put his glow sticks away.
3696448	3697788	And then we're going to come back.
3697868	3704370	We're just going to be a quick break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to talk about... We're going to do Happy Hopper in this break.
3704390	3706131	We're going to do Silhouette of My Mind in this break.
3706211	3706451	Yes.
3706951	3709311	We're going from extremes here.
3709331	3711812	Yes, we're going from very happy to very wrist-slitting-ish.
3712472	3714453	Actually, we're going to go the other way around.
3714473	3715993	We're going to go from wrist-slitting to happy.
3716153	3718354	I look as the blood splashes upon the...
3719555	3720556	Blackness of my soul.
3720576	3720716	I still.
3720796	3721237	I still.
3721317	3722298	Welcome to Goth Talk.
3722318	3725321	And I'm Asriel the Prince of Sorrow.
3740535	3743156	Alright, we'll be right back.
3743316	3746558	We're going to go sad to happy and then we will come back.
3746818	3751460	And this is the time when you're going to want to send me your FUs of the week if you're in our chat room.
3751660	3754021	Because we're going to talk about those when we come back.
3754481	3757463	Enjoy, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3761672	3762634	Thanks for watching!
3800596	3807118	I'm on a train to die How can I find my way to you?

3836867	3837513	Thanks for watching!

3982749	3983510	Are you ready?
3984648	3987090	Ready for the race, are you ready?
3987610	3991913	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we're back and we're live.
3992313	3992573	Huh?
3992653	3993594	Is he a resident of Omaha?
3993634	3994675	Resident of Baltimore.
3995055	3995175	Oh.
3995435	3996716	No, I wouldn't do that.
3996916	4004721	Well, remember that the reason why I said F you to Baltimore was because they were the lowest ranked on the list of what cities are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4005021	4006903	I think they had a whopping, like, second.
4007083	4007223	No.
4007663	4009425	DarkSakura.com
4023341	4027968	One thing that's being said in the chatroom, we have a new face in the chatroom, Tank.
4028028	4030231	I don't recognize this person, new person.
4030271	4034417	He's saying, wow, the musical variety is making me feel like a teen girl.
4034457	4037422	And that just made me think, I'm as happy as a little girl.
4040464	4044466	A big welcome to all our new chatters.
4044486	4045866	I see Orange Beanie's in the chatroom, too.
4046107	4046807	Hi, Beanie.
4046887	4047347	Hi, Beanie.
4047387	4048368	Great job at chat yesterday.
4048388	4049188	Yes, we're proud of you.
4049208	4051530	And all of our chatters, our chatroom's been picking up lately.
4051590	4052250	Our cutesy, girly girl.
4052350	4057273	We've got EOSFVB's a new person, too, I think, that came in last week.
4057293	4059034	And VidPower started chatting here last week.
4059774	4060895	All of our regulars.
4061055	4061575	We love them.
4061735	4062216	Chat room.
4062256	4067819	I think during our next break we need to do our tribute to one of our famous people in our chat room, DJ Konami.
4068339	4069700	Oh, I think that's a good idea.
4070200	4071801	DJ Konami needs a good tribute.
4071981	4072502	We'll do that.
4074163	4074403	So...
4076104	4077585	Let's get to the FUs of the week, shall we?
4077625	4080167	We just talked about the FUs of the week.
4080768	4082489	I'm sorry, we're going to talk about the FUs of the week.
4082509	4086773	We talked about how we don't play... Well, I'm sorry, Jamie has to kick it off.
4087033	4088935	I'll reference what I said later.
4089635	4090076	Never mind.
4090096	4091797	Tell me don't play that.
4091937	4093238	Because you've got to start it off.
4093558	4094419	It's your baby.
4094599	4096741	It's your little crack-infested baby.
4097101	4098542	Crack-infested baby?
4100584	4102426	Never do a drug named after part of your own ass.
4105549	4107150	Waka Laka gives you wings, what?
4107190	4107330	Wee!
4108490	4116053	It is that time of the show, ladies and gentlemen, where Jamie and the rest of us all get pissed off as hell, and we give our FUs of the week!
4117054	4119234	I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!
4119635	4120075	Damn it!
4120415	4121395	Okay, FUs of the week.
4122296	4133320	Um, first one is gonna go, and this wasn't anything anyone could control, so I'm saying fuck you to fate for fucking with us in the fourth mix machine yesterday at Shaft.
4135505	4140149	Damn you all to hell!
4141010	4154524	Another one goes toward... Fuck you to hurting at the end of the day and thank you to Vicodin.
4155926	4157928	Fuck you to sleeping for 13 and a half hours.
4158644	4162185	Sleep feels good, though.
4163386	4164266	Fuck you, too.
4167007	4167528	You know what?
4167668	4169989	I really am not filled with that in the shakes today.
4171869	4173870	Are you really Jamie, or are you an imposter?
4174470	4175871	I feel good.
4176721	4178002	That fucking sucks!
4178662	4185066	Fuck you to my good mood, dammit, because I can't be angsty enough to go off without something enough to just be super pissed.
4185366	4187748	And I have to be super pissed to be ready to kill people, too.
4187768	4188408	Okay, oh.
4189389	4191110	No, no, I can't do that either.
4191390	4191710	Fuck.
4191810	4192171	Next.
4193992	4195473	Okay, so much for that.
4195993	4196633	Sorry to hear that.
4196833	4201336	Well, you know, after 19 weeks of being pissed off, it's time for Jamie to be in a loving, sharing mood, right?
4201756	4202397	Fuck that!
4202797	4203157	Okay?
4203317	4204938	That pisses me the hell... Okay.
4206039	4209902	All right, let's talk to Loki and see what his fuck you of the week is.
4211063	4212064	Fuck you of the week?
4212144	4215507	Oh yeah, fuck you of the week, that's definitely for sure.
4216007	4217128	First one goes to my cold.
4217969	4221411	I don't like having a cold, and it snuck up on me on Friday, and that really sucked.
4221551	4225414	Probably all the rain's fault, so F you to the rain, even though I like rain.
4225995	4228036	And F you for my battery being dead this morning in my car.
4228877	4231859	At least it works now, I think, so that's cool.
4231879	4237664	FU to Cigaru, because I hate that song, and they played it way too many times at the tournament yesterday.
4239225	4242948	Also, a big cute FU to something we're going to be covering in just a little bit.
4243809	4248893	FU to Super Eurobeat, the new song that's going to be on GDR Extreme.
4248913	4251475	One of the most evil things on the face of the earth.
4252215	4255197	When you add Naoki with B4U...
4256318	4258581	I'm very scared and concerned about that one.
4259162	4261184	I show great concern for this new song.
4271112	4273574	Also, let's see what else we got here.
4274295	4280299	F you to my pads for being faulty sometimes and me constantly having to prepare them.
4281159	4294088	F you for myself for getting shocked by my stereo numerous times while I was putting wires to it because I'm an idiot and I was tired and didn't unplug it when I was hooking up wires and just kept going, ow, ow, ow, ow.
4295029	4295689	I don't know why.
4295709	4296330	Um...
4303395	4316142	FU for people not talking in chatrooms enough because I'm bored at work and I read the forums too fast and I go through about eight forums and no one's talking about anything new.
4316622	4317503	So that pisses me off.
4318603	4320624	And I'm running out of things.
4320784	4322245	I'm probably still tired from yesterday.
4322345	4323446	FU for me being tired.
4324053	4324493	Oh, wait, wait.
4324553	4325253	I'm sure there's something.
4325293	4325733	Hold on.
4325773	4326333	It's coming to me.
4326453	4327074	It's coming to me.
4330494	4330974	No!
4332555	4337796	Thinking there's something I remember seeing yesterday that I was going to do an FU about, but I can't remember what it was.
4338556	4338896	Dammit.
4340176	4340756	Well, fuck that.
4340776	4341696	We'll come back to you, Loki.
4341716	4341916	Yes!
4342477	4344317	In the meantime, my FU of the week.
4344337	4345797	We'll come back.
4346397	4346817	We'll come back.
4347318	4349358	My FU of the week goes to myself.
4351010	4366563	Yesterday during the Orange Lounge broadcast, yesterday during the Orange Lounge live broadcast we were doing live from Shaft, we did some music breaks so that Loki and whoever was on air could actually have a break to get up and go out and do something.
4367223	4371627	And one of the CDs that I used during the break was Dance Mania 20.
4372988	4377232	So unfortunately yesterday I unknowingly played Bye Bye Baby Balloon on this station.
4377832	4378413	You bitch!
4380405	4390795	So a big fuck you to me for breaking that rule that I put down weeks and weeks ago when Bye Bye Baby Balloon was voted by the listless process as the worst Bomani song next to Let Them Move.
4391255	4392016	I played it yesterday.
4392036	4393998	Not only did I play it, I played the full version.
4396620	4401085	I didn't play Dirty yesterday, however I have in the past.
4401105	4402406	I have a fuck you.
4402446	4402927	I have one.
4403928	4404188	Yes.
4404308	4404869	I have one.
4404889	4407532	Okay, we have to go back to your music.
4407552	4408633	Yes, of course.
4409253	4413177	My fuck you goes toward that damn song for finally growing on me.
4413277	4414158	Oh my god.
4414639	4417902	I found myself at work with that song stuck in my head.
4417942	4418283	What song?
4418323	4419464	Fucking Dirty.
4421225	4422866	I'm pointing at you, Jamie.
4423647	4424207	Fuck you.
4424227	4425889	Stop pointing at me.
4425969	4427070	Everybody yell at Rob.
4427830	4428190	Nini.
4428210	4429852	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4429872	4432073	Did Loki, oh, Loki, you thought he'd rep you?
4437808	4438068	All right.
4439429	4441310	Okay, this is a general FU.
4441811	4443212	FU do speed mixes.
4443672	4445613	They're the dumbest things in the face of the earth.
4445774	4448455	I hate everybody that does speed mixes of any sort.
4448776	4452818	This goes with Jenny Rom and the Zippers.
4453119	4454620	I hate them all.
4454740	4455620	I hate them all.
4455800	4457422	JB is walking here right now.
4457502	4457862	I don't care.
4457882	4459463	He's going to walk a lock on your ass.
4459543	4459983	I don't care.
4460043	4460704	Okay, no.
4460844	4462385	No, they've done some slower stuff.
4462405	4463025	It's cool.
4463206	4463966	But I hate... I hate...
4465527	4467750	B-Mixes, I hate them to death!
4468250	4479764	Okay, now, okay, I'll give credit to, you know, Jenny Ranma's stuff because some of her stuff is good, I do like it, you know, but I dislike, for instance, we just heard the Venus, um, what was it, uh, you can leave me alone.
4480145	4481927	Yeah, we just heard it like an hour ago.
4482547	4483588	Whatever, okay?
4484228	4484788	So we heard it.
4484868	4486449	It sounds like shit, okay?
4486469	4489170	That's just, just like, okay, I've heard one more time.
4489550	4490550	That sounds like shit.
4490650	4493751	I've heard, like, I don't know, there's a bunch of stuff I've heard.
4493971	4495212	All of it sounds like crap.
4495732	4501374	You just speed it up and have some guy cover it because you can't pay the artist royalty fees, and it sounds like shit.
4501574	4503935	And then the comic goes, whew, it's fast.
4504155	4507516	Let's put it in our next New York Stream Super Duper Mix.
4508057	4511038	And then, you know, people play it and go, damn, this is tiring.
4511698	4512439	I dislike it.
4512599	4513019	I hate it.
4513239	4514820	And living in America sucks ass.
4514880	4518042	Remember, DDR isn't just a power, it's a super-duper power.
4518563	4520224	Ugh, God.
4521144	4523686	Stupid, freaking... Wow.
4523806	4526988	And F you to Naoki, because... I don't want to say that.
4527068	4530791	And F you to freaking Naoki Jules, because he's not putting anything good in there.
4531451	4532992	Why is he just speaking Japanese?
4533012	4534854	Why is he Japanese or something?
4534874	4537295	He can't speak English like everybody else in the face here.
4542518	4544159	So find out what this fuck is.
4544379	4545879	Oh, oh, oh, and here's another one.
4545899	4548000	Okay, since I'm going off on the EDR extreme.
4548480	4550100	It's the Loki show, ladies and gentlemen.
4550541	4550881	Okay.
4551281	4554342	What the hell kind of... They need to come up with some better names for the songs.
4554682	4556722	Let's have Paranoia Survivor Max.
4558523	4559103	What is that?
4559123	4561564	I mean, come on, name it something else.
4561584	4563324	What's up with that?
4563364	4564765	What is the deal with milk?
4565325	4565765	Seriously.
4567919	4568219	All right.
4568319	4571481	I'm done.
4572061	4572481	I'm done.
4574042	4574762	I'm finished.
4574782	4577944	The chat room is yelling at you, Loki.
4577964	4579565	They're half with you and half against you.
4579585	4583346	Half of them are with you and half of them are against you.
4583706	4584347	Oh, dear God.
4586027	4587388	Are we ever going to get to the chat rooms?
4588549	4589889	Fuck the chat rooms.
4589989	4590289	I'm sorry.
4590329	4591490	I love you guys, so forget it.
4592765	4594887	First of all, speak mixes are okay.
4595867	4597969	Some of them suck ass.
4597989	4603533	Major fuckers go to Politary for still being alive.
4603573	4609538	Woman, I've been listening to Politary now, unfortunately, for days.
4610338	4611399	Because it keeps coming up.
4612228	4615270	I say that we have a one-week ban of Politary from our radio show.
4615611	4617432	Oh, we're going to ban Politary from the radio show?
4617872	4618773	Just for a week.
4618793	4619334	Just for a week?
4619574	4623016	There are some songs that have good music in them that are just ruined by her voice.
4623257	4623657	All right.
4624057	4624598	Fair enough.
4624738	4630262	Starting tomorrow, Orange Lounge has banned Politary from its playlist completely.
4630882	4632444	I have another proposition.
4632704	4634405	I am offering a $500 bounty for Politary.
4638528	4638848	Dead.
4639669	4641470	No, no, you can't kill her.
4642051	4643392	Just killing is wrong.
4643412	4644913	Alright, how about this?
4644933	4646094	$500 for her to go mute.
4646614	4648716	Shove, like, acid down her throat?
4648736	4649717	Shove a Twinkie down her throat.
4649737	4651838	A fried Twinkie.
4652419	4655441	$500 for a super hot fried Twinkie shoved down Voluntary's throat.
4655461	4656482	To dissolve her larynx.
4657102	4658904	And she can't sing anymore.
4660009	4664391	I want her tongue sent to me in a plastic baggie through the mail.
4665811	4669933	Make sure that you vacuum seal it so that it stays fresh so we can see it still twitch.
4671414	4672514	Oh my god!
4673054	4674975	We've had sex, we've had violence.
4678276	4679977	We've had sex in the first hour of this show.
4679997	4683819	We have violence right now and probably drugs before it's all over.
4684279	4685419	I had my Vicodin already.
4685539	4687220	Orange Lounge goes to hell tonight.
4689104	4691486	We're going to hell in a hat and basket and you're all coming with us.
4691666	4693027	Can I get to the chatroom FUs?
4693807	4694728	No.
4694748	4695469	Uh, yeah, sure.
4695489	4696810	Alright, here we go.
4696850	4699031	We're going to give the chatroom special music today.
4699572	4701433	I have to give them something to yell about.
4701453	4703134	Now they can all do an FU to Loki.
4703154	4705836	Uh-oh, Orange Beanie's a little mad about Politary.
4706937	4708558	Alright, what music do you need?
4709719	4714723	Also, I'm going to have to say that, um... Oh, shoot, what else was one of my, uh...
4715783	4717665	F.U.
4717685	4724309	to Scandia for having their party room window covered up by blue paint or something because I couldn't see the freaking machine.
4724349	4726651	But Scandia rules, so we'll forgive them this one time.
4727751	4729613	Ah, yes, Orange Lounge Vice City tonight.
4730173	4731394	That's what we're being called.
4731994	4733215	You know, oh, F.U.
4733235	4739259	to Vice City because I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
4739499	4741541	She gets in my car, she takes money.
4741961	4742842	You know what?
4743022	4744543	That's your sound clip from now on.
4745703	4748504	For the life of me, I can't get the hooker to have sex with me.
4749324	4753026	This is now chat room fuck you time, so Rob, go at it.
4753326	4755667	Oh, yes, okay.
4756847	4758748	Oh, I had special music for them, that's okay.
4759008	4761188	This one's all nice and fast and angsty.
4761428	4762689	Speed mixy, if you will.
4764165	4766547	Hey, okay, I like KOGG3, okay?
4766567	4770951	They kick ass, and so does RedMonsterHyper, or whatever that is.
4771291	4774713	But, um, here we go.
4775374	4780098	DSCS SoCalKick says, F you to the rain and cold that made them almost sick-ass Loki sounds.
4780538	4782840	Fuck you, Owen, for not wanting to go to the movies on Monday.
4782900	4789447	Fuck you, Char Plus Parents, these are all people we don't know, for not letting me go over this weekend in FU time, because there isn't enough of it.
4789527	4799016	I have to beta test STK Max 5.0 in the next two to three days, finish my special art project by Wednesday, or get an F on it, and make an avid side of my ass before December 7th.
4799416	4803580	And F you to Loki, tell him to get him on fucking AIM, because I'm home all effing day.
4808044	4810171	Dave, I have to give Dave special music.
4810191	4812117	I don't remember what Dave's FU song was, though.
4812137	4813522	Does anybody remember Dave's FU song?
4815026	4816307	I'm just going to play this song for Dave.
4816327	4819269	He'll like it.
4820129	4823692	Dave says, F you Tigger for being so freaking good.
4824092	4825673	Why do you have to own every song?
4825733	4829835	He beat me in the quarterfinals on the Can't Stop Falling in Love speed mix by 31 greats.
4830336	4831957	I got 40 out of 444.
4832077	4832317	He got 9.
4832617	4834058	I came in fifth though.
4834799	4839061	Un-fuck the weekend for being three days long, but fuck RyRy's parents for not trusting her with me.
4839301	4841363	Wow, that's a little intense there.
4842624	4843884	I shouldn't have read that out loud.
4843924	4844305	I'm sorry.
4845265	4846366	I'm reading without thinking.
4846406	4846666	Sorry.
4846686	4850568	I hope she's not listening with her speakers turned up.
4850588	4851829	Somebody's in trouble.
4851989	4852409	My bad.
4852449	4852950	Sorry, guys.
4855511	4858693	Back to the rest of the chatroom.
4861495	4862495	God, he's got too many.
4862555	4863536	I'm only doing part of these.
4865488	4883866	F you for not understanding a single word of the Shaft stuff tonight F every female on this planet F celebrate night for fucking me up on Oni F the entire CBS DDR coverage which we've got to talk about before the show's over F those stupid dancers who won PS2 and pads on that and F Loki because he asked for it
4889104	4896429	23rd Magus, F. Roulette, he expects something non-rave style when he does improv freestyle, or something like Sugaru for improv.
4897089	4897810	That's for you, Loki.
4898270	4900331	In status, we all know he got Nori Nori Nori.
4900391	4903953	Kill, I still should get an award for most incongruous routine.
4904013	4905134	Fuck you, Nori Nori Nori.
4907315	4912839	DJ Konami, F you to Kakumei Encore Stage because I failed on the 6th step.
4915229	4917510	SoCalKicks, I missed a part and I closed the window.
4917550	4917890	I'm sorry.
4918170	4918710	Resend it to me.
4918750	4919110	I'll read it.
4919810	4924532	JB says, F you to anyone who doesn't like Hello Panda cookies.
4924752	4926052	They should be stabbed with sporks.
4927373	4930053	F you to hurting after the turning and burning myself in the deep fryer.
4931454	4932814	I like Hello Panda cookies.
4933554	4936175	And I say Politary can sing and Naoki can't compose.
4936215	4942357	I'd like to add that, JB, you know, kind of that was your fault since you're deep frying everything that you can get your hands on.
4944066	4947070	That was pretty entertaining watching him deep fry pretty much everything.
4947430	4954219	And I think one of the most popular things that was being deep fried yesterday, other than the Twinkies, had to have been the candy corn.
4954239	4956121	By the way, you're very welcome.
4956702	4958725	I hope you enjoyed your Hello Kitty Yang Yangs.
4962543	4966625	DDRholic, oh, I love DDRholic, she's so cool.
4966845	4970767	FU for there not being such anything as Guys Gone Wild videos.
4971167	4972187	Amen to that.
4973068	4973808	Go on, girl.
4973888	4981331	Actually, they did a thing, like, they did Guys Gone Wild, like a promo for that on the guy show, or the man show.
4981351	4983772	They didn't make a real one.
4984152	4986954	FU to Girls Gone Wild, there should be a Guys Gone Wild series.
4989497	4996599	EOSFBB says, wow, fuck you.
4996640	5002201	It's a little, a little racist.
5002241	5003362	I don't want to read that on the air.
5003802	5006423	So he says China Power, so we'll leave it at that.
5008379	5014361	Fitpower says, my FU of the week goes to the official Animal Crossing site because they've taken down the Donkey Kong Jr.
5014381	5021143	NES game and it's now replaced with Clu Clu Land D. Now I can't get Donkey Kong Jr.
5021183	5021923	in my town now.
5022503	5030905	Also FU to Wrapping Paper because I like to keep my DVD covers in excellent condition and the Wrapping Paper took about 45 minutes to get off because of all the extra tape they put on it.
5031846	5032686	I have another FU.
5035167	5036247	You've hit your quota for the night.
5037682	5039023	I'm the angsty happy bunny.
5039804	5045949	My fuck you of the week goes to my fiancee, Dan, for hitting Mallory in the head with the bug net.
5046169	5048431	Mallory is a bitch and she needs to die.
5048471	5050813	She needs to burn in Animal Crossing hell.
5050993	5053876	Go to Animal Crossing hell and burn, Mallory.
5053896	5054857	I hate you.
5055257	5062203	And also to our town lesbian, Dina, because she went ahead and took care of her errand myself just because it was a day late.
5064331	5068754	and, and, and, and, and Fuck You to, um, well, you know what?
5068774	5075859	I need people to play Phantasy Star with, so if anyone has Phantasy Star Online and a broadband thingy for the GameCube, let me know, or if not, then Fuck You.
5076660	5077641	Because I want to play it with you.
5079102	5081403	SoCalKick says F you to whoever hates on Loki.
5081423	5082304	He doesn't get my music.
5082324	5083965	I'm sorry, you're right, he doesn't get your music.
5084125	5085486	He gets something even better.
5087027	5092111	F you to whoever hates on Loki, because that was the best rant-a-thon I've heard in ages.
5095076	5098977	23rd Magus, Politaris, sounds like Yoko Ono with laryngitis.
5100918	5104458	Gwen says F you to me because I wasn't supposed to say that female one on the air.
5105058	5105499	My bad.
5106919	5111260	EOSFVB says F you to me for being quote unquote racist.
5111720	5115241	Sorry, I just kind of used some kind of words I don't want to say on the air.
5115281	5116261	Kind of bad.
5118561	5120282	And DDR, it's on a happy note.
5120302	5121862	Thanks for the kudos, Rob and Jamie.
5125149	5130372	And F you to whoever took my signed tape, because I won the season 10 for a fourth time.
5131013	5134735	And I have to watch my bootleg DVD, which has really bad subtitles.
5135396	5136196	The end.
5136416	5136857	F that.
5138117	5139278	Fuck this song.
5140059	5141419	Alright, F this song.
5142300	5145082	One, two, three, four, this song really sucks.
5145722	5149485	Uh, I need to find my copy of Instant Love, because I don't know where it is.
5150345	5152226	It's on one of the old pre-shows, too.
5152326	5152987	Oh, God.
5154747	5156889	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!
5182385	5187007	I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
5187648	5190249	Listen carefully and try to follow.
5191129	5193211	The object will come down from the top.
5193531	5196872	When it hits the red line, push the button.
5198433	5201475	When it hits the red line, turn the table.
5202175	5202835	You get it?
5203236	5204956	Alright, let's practice.
5232470	5233511	Thank you for watching!
5262442	5266226	Now it's for all the keys and the turntable.
5266326	5269129	It's hard, but you can do it.
5269189	5271512	It's not the ball, it's the ball.
5271612	5273534	It's the ball, it's the ball.
5273574	5275275	It's the ball, it's the ball.
5298744	5299752	New Feat Media
5330766	5336091	The Powerful Sound System will make everybody HOT!
5336111	5337493	Alright, gotta go!

5590854	5591937	Thank you for watching!
5661492	5664896	Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
5665076	5666818	It's a good place to listen to the music.
5670310	5670590	What?
5670830	5673711	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5674652	5676533	If you don't know Wesley Willis, maybe you should.
5677113	5679034	That's where that little promo comes from.
5679574	5686717	It was a joke, and I don't even think it was really something I ever intended on putting into the station rotation, but we need a new promo, so what can I say?
5687037	5688177	We'll make more then.
5688237	5690358	We'll make more.
5690898	5695240	Now that tournament's over, we can sometime this week get you guys over and we'll work on more promos.
5695260	5695760	That'll be fun.
5697041	5697141	Um,
5699340	5700802	Bubble Bobble Techno Song
5715299	5717100	It was one of the Overclocked remixes.
5717460	5718720	So probably Overclocked.org?
5719261	5719481	Yep.
5719621	5721481	And search for... Should be Overclocked.org, it's gonna be.
5721781	5723502	Search for Bubble Bobble and you'll probably find it.
5723722	5731145	All I gotta say is, you know, I've been, you know, especially nowadays, you know, I'm totally browsing the internet while I'm working.
5731886	5733568	DJ Final Fantasy
5748247	5752629	And he's actually done some stuff for Final Fantasy 7.
5752749	5755930	He did this one that's called Strings Machine.
5756130	5757231	It's just an awesome trance.
5757471	5759832	I mean, this guy should be doing professional stuff.
5759912	5761953	I mean, I don't know why he's not.
5761973	5764194	The ones to check out are definitely Strings Machine.
5765235	5768257	Then there's also one that's a Geneva trance remix.
5768437	5769298	That's really cool.
5770099	5771019	There's a few other ones.
5771620	5773682	Metalroid is another good one to check out.
5773722	5775964	It's a Metroid-themed remix.
5776024	5778005	It's kind of hard rock, which is pretty cool.
5778025	5779126	What's that URL one more time?
5779647	5783430	I believe it's remix.overclocked.org.
5783850	5784190	Okay.
5784551	5784951	Yeah, okay.
5784991	5785351	That's cool.
5785391	5785972	Remix.overclocked.
5786312	5786753	Good stuff.
5787413	5789575	If you just do a web search for overclocked, you'll find it.
5790086	5793847	Well, you might want to do Overclock Remix, otherwise you're going to get a bunch of sites.
5794207	5795107	Don't clock me.
5795647	5798728	Alright, let's talk about... We've got about 20 minutes left in the show.
5798748	5800708	We've got about a bunch of Imani news to cram in.
5800728	5804289	But speaking of time left in the show, this is an announcement we haven't made yet during the show.
5804329	5806629	We probably should have opened the show saying it.
5807189	5814331	But starting next week with episode 20, Orange Lounge season number two debuts.
5814631	5815571	A whole new season.
5816363	5823932	As far as I'm concerned, the past 21 shows or however many we did, because we had a couple half shows in there, they've all been leading up to next week.
5823953	5825995	This has all been practice.
5826776	5829680	Because next week we're taking Orange Lounge to three hours.
5830541	5831542	A three hour tour.
5832583	5833644	3-Hour Treatment
5860240	5867264	Maybe we should be here when Rob makes the intro, or maybe someone should hook me up with a particular program that we need to let somebody else make an intro.
5868525	5869225	I can hear it now.
5869966	5873948	Loki, for the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me.
5874568	5876590	Thank you for giving that to me once again nice and clear.
5876610	5877890	That'll make editing a lot easier.
5877930	5878251	Thank you.
5880112	5881153	So that's how it's going to go.
5881193	5883515	It's going to go 6.30 to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.
5883995	5890340	The replays will still be 7 o'clock on Monday and 2 o'clock on Thursday for the time being.
5890640	5892301	As long as I get to be an angsty happy bunny.
5892501	5893582	Of course, as always.
5894103	5896084	Happy, or angsty, or both.
5896805	5899687	That's pretty much all you need to know.
5899807	5901128	New season starts next week.
5901168	5903370	Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
5904030	5904651	Go Joe!
5906169	5907711	Okay, Bomani News this week.
5907911	5910435	Way back to Monday, day after we did this show.
5910875	5917344	CBS, on the early show, did a little DDR promotion on it.
5918646	5923412	It was basically one gigantic infomercial for DDR where everybody did not know shit.
5925143	5925403	Yep.
5926184	5927625	That would be the best way to describe it.
5927685	5932029	It was like taking the audience members from an infomercial and having them do the infomercial.
5932069	5932909	Here's what they did, okay?
5932949	5938774	They got this local dance school to come down there, and they had these people that I guess were from some dance school, from what it looked like.
5939194	5940575	A local school, everything.
5940836	5941877	And they were playing DDR.
5941917	5943638	The Dance School of Jennifer Lopez.
5943978	5945740	Okay, it was pretty bad.
5945920	5947321	I mean, no one really knew what they were doing.
5947801	5950724	Watching, like, newbie people playing DDR USA.
5950744	5952705	You know, they had three machines set up there.
5953366	5953586	And then...
5954446	5958328	Oh, speaking of the machine setup, this pissed me off.
5958488	5962070	I don't know why I get angry about it, but I just find it kind of irritating.
5962571	5966373	They had Max 2 machines with USA banners on them.
5968809	5972875	That really strikes a bad chord with me.
5972915	5976439	It's kind of like, Konami, why do you have to lie?
5977020	5978783	Why don't you just give us a new mix?
5979203	5980525	Oh, that's interesting.
5980785	5981807	Did you not notice that?
5981827	5982367	I did not notice that.
5982387	5986193	There was freeze arrows, and one of the songs being played was Japan.
5987934	5990277	They had Max 2... Matsuri Japan.
5990357	5991378	Sorry, Matsuri Japan.
5991858	5994361	One of the machines, the one in the middle was a USA machine.
5994381	5996703	The one that the CBS host played on, that was a USA machine.
5996743	5999065	However, the two side machines were Max 2 machines.
5999586	6008294	And it's kind of like, you kind of feel like, you know, obviously for Joe Q public, those that don't know DDR very well, you know, it doesn't matter.
6008334	6009135	It's not a big deal.
6009675	6009896	But...
6011898	6015042	You're kind of like, why are you misrepresenting the product here?
6015462	6018786	I mean, now the home version of Max is similar to Max 2.
6019027	6020449	It's got a lot of the cool things Max 2 does.
6020829	6023713	Why didn't we just have somebody demo the home version of Max?
6024113	6028418	Why did we have to invent these arcade machines that don't exist in the U.S. ?
6029399	6030039	I don't know.
6030800	6032640	It doesn't sit well with me.
6032700	6035261	I think Konami deserves a big slap on the wrist for that.
6035481	6039182	Well, one of the highlights I thought that was pretty interesting... Or whoever made that decision.
6039202	6040422	Maybe Konami didn't make that decision.
6040442	6048485	You gotta love that they had a video game expert there who was talking about DDR and had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.
6049825	6054728	All I could think of during that whole thing was, that guy's really gay.
6055149	6056249	He's really, really gay.
6056309	6057470	He's saying gay things.
6057510	6058771	He's kind of talking gay.
6059251	6061172	This whole segment's kind of gay.
6062693	6064374	I would have, well, I don't know.
6064434	6065375	I didn't see this.
6065575	6067996	And I'm sounding vaguely glad that I didn't.
6068196	6069357	You know, I was asleep.
6070859	6076566	I'm being reminded that one reason they probably did the marquee switch was because imports are illegal.
6077006	6077887	Okay, true that.
6078468	6084015	But that doesn't get around the issue of you used an import machine, you just lied about it.
6084975	6089740	Exactly, I mean... It's like, you know, okay, so they had trouble importing USA machines.
6090280	6092883	Fine, why didn't we promo Max USA?
6092963	6094504	It's a damn good product.
6094945	6096526	That's what we should have been demoing.
6096846	6106035	You know, if they had, you know, maybe put out a PlayStation, a couple ignition pads, could have whored out Red Octane, or the official Konami pads, if Konami wants to whore out their own product.
6106055	6108918	Well, what they ended up doing is they had a drawing throughout the show, which...
6109458	6114279	Any, anyone watching the show really didn't give a rat's ass, it was only for the people actually at the show.
6114299	6117100	Yeah, I know, Super Contest, which has been pre-changed.
6117120	6132023	It was, um, two, uh, pretty shitty-ass, um, third-party dance performance pads and a, uh, what was that, PlayStation 2 and a DDR Max, uh, USA, uh, game, which is pretty, I mean, obviously that's pretty cool, you know, I'd love, you know, to win that if I was there.
6133063	6135624	The thing is, they didn't really plug the game that much.
6135824	6137545	I mean, they talked about, you know... No.
6138005	6138885	No, they kind of didn't.
6138925	6151130	They were just kind of like, well, it's this new game that's sweeping the nation, and we're going to let these ignoramus dance students play it, and we're going to give one of them a fabulous prize of a home version game that we're going to just kind of show you.
6151690	6152330	The box art of it.
6152350	6153151	You know what's funny?
6153351	6153951	Is Konami...
6154491	6155031	DDR Max and Konomics
6185391	6189613	And also, it might not have been Konami's fault.
6189633	6191794	That whole switcheroo might not have been Konami's fault.
6192314	6196295	It may have been CBS that made that decision, but F whoever did that, because that wasn't cool.
6196615	6198336	Whoever's decision it was, F them.
6199757	6206739	I saw some pictures from it, and honestly, if you're going to show off something, it's like having a product.
6206779	6209780	If you're going to show a product, you put it in the most positive light possible.
6210260	6211421	And you don't do it by putting...
6212279	6213381	Thank you for watching!
6225277	6226318	by a Catholic priest.
6227238	6228739	It's the same difference.
6228759	6232982	They have no idea how to do any of that, unless they've been reading confiscated material.
6234102	6235123	I don't know about some of them.
6236043	6236604	No, I agree.
6236704	6239986	I don't understand why they didn't interview the dance expert.
6240006	6241987	They had all these DDR people in.
6242527	6245209	They flew 8-Ball out there, or he flew out there.
6245229	6246910	I don't know what the hell the arrangement was there.
6247610	6250972	But he was just kind of there in the background wearing a DDR Freak t-shirt.
6251432	6254994	I thought I... Didn't he make a comment during one of the clips?
6255234	6259215	I'm not sure, because I didn't exactly... I don't know what 8-Ball looks like, to be honest.
6259415	6264858	And I thought there was some guy that looked like he knew who he was talking about, and... He was the only guy wearing a DDR Freak shirt.
6265078	6266018	Oh, that might have been him, then.
6266098	6266518	I don't know.
6266658	6267379	I can't remember.
6267399	6268159	If I remember correctly.
6269500	6270041	I don't know either.
6271302	6276587	But yeah, the dance school's kids should not have been there, and whoever that guy was wasn't Konami.
6276607	6277928	He shouldn't have been there either.
6277948	6278969	Let me just put it this way, though.
6279770	6281632	Any publicity is good publicity.
6282068	6285110	That's very true, and you know, it's going to sell the game a little more.
6285170	6287191	Maybe we will get an arcade machine in the U.S.
6287231	6301300	that's like Max 2, but... You know, we had the discussion about it, you know, it was me and... I don't remember who I was talking to about it, but we were making the discussion that now that the whole Endemiro suit's been settled, or is in process of settling, I'm not sure.
6301320	6309905	It should be, it's long over, whatever... It opens the door for a new mix, and I don't think that it's necessarily that Konami themselves have to do the work on it.
6311555	6317799	If they're allowing third parties to do the arcade releases, they could just as easily have a team set aside.
6318179	6321621	I know, it's just kind of like... And it will make so much money.
6322001	6334568	If we were just in the know a little more, if we knew a little bit more about how all that operation works, what goes on inside Konami's roof, inside Konami's Japan roof, inside Konami of America's roof, it would probably make a lot more sense to us.
6334608	6337870	We wouldn't be so bitter about this game that we've wasted so much money on.
6338190	6339151	The fact is, we don't.
6339651	6354626	and so we're just confused and we don't get but luckily at least the home releases are moving in the right direction by far so if they do end up doing a Max 2 in the US which I don't see why they wouldn't it'll probably kick a lot of ass so
6356801	6358122	All right, CBS, yes.
6358482	6361844	So, well, I guess we can talk about other, you know, smaller stuff.
6361884	6363425	Yes, any other news you know?
6364125	6368928	Well, we've got, of course, you know, the eighth release of Characters for DDRPC.
6369048	6371489	Not that anyone ever plays that game anymore.
6371589	6376372	I mean, I'm sure there are certain people that play that game, but I know for me... I did see this morning.
6376752	6379693	I did not, I did not play this, I don't play this game anymore.
6379733	6381314	It crashes on my computer and whatever.
6381594	6382835	Is there a new character to be released?
6383375	6388858	The newest characters that we have, we've got two Latin people, I don't remember their names are, it doesn't really matter.
6389138	6391699	But the most important one is Jason Enos.
6391959	6394640	Yes, Jason Enos is a playable character in DDR.
6395481	6400083	Which we all pretty much knew about ever since the game came out that he would be released at some point.
6400103	6404605	That's exactly what I said, his head is smaller than the rest of his body.
6404665	6407046	Some graphic artist really fucked up on that.
6408052	6409393	And his shirt looks like your shoes.
6409473	6410033	That was cool.
6410073	6410934	Dude, I love the shirt.
6410994	6411514	I want that.
6411554	6413015	The shirt was awesome.
6413075	6414196	But he has a shrunken head.
6414236	6415377	That's a real bummer.
6415617	6416478	But it's still pretty neat.
6416518	6416938	But I don't know.
6416978	6417938	We didn't play it in-game.
6417978	6420000	I haven't played it in-game yet, so he probably looks okay there.
6420020	6421221	But that little preview picture of him?
6422161	6424603	It's still really cool.
6424743	6426924	You know that you've made it when you are in DDR.
6428445	6431827	DJ Konami's hoping that they release Kyle Snyder as a hidden character at some point.
6433008	6434109	Probably not going to happen.
6435296	6436597	And a Sky character, yes.
6437177	6438538	And a DarkSakura.
6439178	6441039	Sky and DarkSakura should be a team that comes up.
6442239	6443420	But we'd have to have orange bats.
6444521	6447182	Okay, if they gave us orange bats, would you be a DDRPC character?
6447202	6447962	Okay, I would.
6448002	6452805	But, you know, someone let us know if you can, you know, make skins for the characters or something.
6452865	6454466	Let us know if anyone's figured out how to hack it.
6454726	6461309	And then Loki can be in DDRPC, too, and he'll kind of have that big trench coat of his on doing that whole Keanu Reeves thing.
6461329	6462289	Whoa, I know DDR.
6463990	6465852	Whoa, I forgot my steps.
6466672	6469094	A little insight there.
6471336	6474018	Other than that, some stuff that's probably going to be announced.
6474178	6478161	I'm not positive it's going to be announced next week, but that's when it's scheduled to be announced.
6478802	6479302	Tourney Mix 3.
6480403	6482044	Yes, Tourney Mix 3 is coming up.
6482345	6484226	Oh, this would be the sim news portion.
6484246	6485847	Yes, sim news, I guess.
6486127	6489690	Tourney Mix 3 is going to be started, so we're going to see a lot more sim files.
6489770	6490131	Hooray.
6490991	6501640	And, you know, this time around, I'm expecting Vimani really not to enter, you know, unless, of course, you know, almost all of his files are out there except for one, and that's the return.
6502281	6505243	And so, well, if he is going to enter, it would probably be that one.
6506204	6507065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6523994	6525295	Loki gets on the soapbox.
6526076	6527537	Yeah, okay, off my soapbox here.
6527797	6529999	So, Tournament Mix 3, they're talking about actually having prizes.
6530319	6536164	There was going to be some DVDs provided by myself, but they never took me up on that, and now it's too late.
6536304	6538686	So, you know, oh well, screw that.
6538706	6540187	They're going to have to buy their own prizes.
6540667	6542709	So there's probably going to be prizes this time around.
6543109	6547472	There might be a section where you actually have to pay to enter, so that's kind of crap, but whatever.
6547572	6548113	This time...
6548493	6554275	This time, unlike the last two times that I said I was going to enter, this time I will enter because I'm actually making sim files now.
6554795	6559517	So you'll see something from me in there if it's not something that I've already made.
6559757	6562718	So we'll see something from me in the tournament this time.
6563619	6565279	I guess I can plug my site a little bit.
6565419	6568861	Of course, everyone knows about www.leachfromloki.tk.
6569981	6575085	I'm going to be uploading, probably tonight, my finished copy of Outer Limits.
6575425	6577967	I finished that, no, actually, yesterday.
6578087	6578607	Yay!
6579287	6581449	How did you have any time to finish that yesterday?
6582029	6584851	Well, technically yesterday, if you consider, like, 1 a.m.
6585191	6585612	yesterday.
6587133	6591355	And so, I finished that yesterday, so it's almost, it's, no, all ready to go.
6591395	6592416	I just need to upload it.
6592616	6594538	It's kind of fun, pretty difficult.
6594658	6599321	I tried playing it on the pad today, and I just realized I can't do 10-footers on a pad, so.
6601221	6603522	Other than that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs.
6603562	6611305	They've got their user sim file section updated to where people can submit files now and you'll see a bunch of cool stuff come on there.
6612265	6617607	Also, DDR UK, if you're not a member of that site, I recommend becoming one because...
6618607	6624830	Lawrence there, who also you might know him from his Bantu originals and that kind of thing.
6624910	6629132	He actually is doing synced sets for DDR.
6629272	6636236	He's got synced sets for Euromix and Euromix 2 full sets with MP3s and everything that you can download in one huge zip or by themselves.
6636396	6640358	And also he has Disney's Rave done and he's working on Club Mix and he's going to do the rest.
6640698	6647445	And actually if you find his site, which I can't remember the URL by itself, he's got sync sets for Max 2 and DDR Max.
6647525	6657095	And I think he had at one point all the other original, you know, 1 through, you know, 5th, but, you know, I have them, but they're not on the site anymore.
6657555	6658676	So you'll have to find them somewhere else.
6658716	6660838	But they're out there, so just, you know, keep looking.
6661981	6665345	Other than that, I don't think there's any more updates with Stepmania.
6665365	6666266	I haven't heard anything.
6666286	6668829	The final just got released.
6669029	6670210	Some tumbleweed rolled by.
6670410	6670650	Yeah.
6671672	6676777	The final got released a couple weeks ago, so not too much going on there.
6678138	6680160	Really, that's pretty much it.
6680240	6683364	I know there's a few people still trying to find out a way to crack the max...
6684905	6688690	The DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing there.
6689391	6693796	Something I've been working on for months and kind of given up on because I don't play the arcade machines anymore.
6693876	6698041	But maybe we'll crack that and then I'll go play again and make some more edits.
6698221	6702686	And I'm supposed to make some edits to be on SoCalKicks' site, so look for those.
6703527	6703587	Wee!
6723847	6727929	Love is the Power, which is the ending theme from DDR Second Mix.
6728329	6730930	So that's going to be in there, another Naoki track.
6731110	6744735	Also, as I mentioned earlier in my FUs of the Week, Super Eurobeat, which is going to be done by Naoki featuring the DDR All-Stars, which is Paul Terry, B4U, and some other chick, I can't remember the name.
6745975	6748316	So yeah, you'll have to listen for that one.
6748336	6750057	I'm sure it's going to sound like a train wreck.
6751858	6754119	Also, a few more Oni courses.
6754159	6766605	There's a really particular evil one that's got a bunch of slow songs like Bag and Orion 78 played at half speed, so it's going to look like one giant mass of arrows coming up the screen that you can't read, so that'll be fun, I guess.
6767726	6769246	Check Aaron in Japan's site.
6769286	6776210	He's got a really cool comprehensive list on there, and his stuff's pretty updated really frequently, so go check that out.
6777070	6777991	And that's pretty much it.
6779804	6785608	All right, well, we've got a few more minutes left in the show, and I thought what I'd do is open up the mailbag.
6786208	6790231	We're going to open up the email mailbag right now on the station.
6790792	6793433	So let's get some mailbagging music, shall we?
6794114	6794494	Let's do.
6794634	6799177	I'm... I'll tell you, let me go ahead and make a mention of something while you're... Yes, please do.
6799377	6802139	I'm working on a little something now that I have some spare time.
6802179	6803720	Again, this tournament's over, thank God.
6804401	6804501	Um...
6805569	6813251	Basically, go ahead and send in an email to orangechallengeradio.com with what your favorite joke of the show is.
6813311	6827655	That would be whether it's Malky's Diary, maybe, or maybe our hatred of Paul Terry, or your favorite segment, or maybe even our listless segment.
6827695	6828555	What is your favorite...
6829916	6832158	You know, staple discussion of our show.
6832538	6837582	And go ahead and send that and just put attention DS for the subject.
6838223	6841406	And you may see something come of that within the next few weeks.
6841566	6842267	All right, cool.
6842367	6847611	That email address is orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.
6847912	6849914	And we're going to go check the mailbag right now.
6852176	6853857	Going to the mailbag, going to the mailbag.
6857749	6859470	Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.
6861250	6863990	Ah, I see this entire week we've gotten one new email.
6864150	6867651	Hey, that's one more than we got last week.
6867751	6869472	Yes, and a lengthy one it is, too.
6869552	6870892	Yes, this is a great email.
6872052	6881094	This comes to us from somebody who refers to themselves as Mask Kun of Suspenseful on behalf of the entire Closet Poppers Society.
6881734	6885655	Now, when I first read this, I thought, Closet Poppers, that sounds kind of like a rave thing.
6887672	6888553	Read the letter.
6888573	6889273	Let's read the letter.
6889873	6890594	Well, thank you.
6890674	6891374	We love you.
6891394	6892215	Well, there is three of us now.
6892235	6892515	Thank you.
6911016	6916143	Which is located between the paint cans at his hardware store, which he is not at one of our meetings.
6917225	6919889	Your 24-hour Bomani words of wisdom inspire us all.
6920009	6921651	I love people that can kiss some ass.
6921832	6922432	It's great.
6923534	6923874	Beautiful.
6925556	6927597	And we try our best to play every game that they make.
6928317	6936520	Unfortunately, we feel that there may be major bias within those divine offices, and it is starting to get on the Coalition's nerves just a tiny bit.
6937160	6938040	What are we talking about?
6938100	6946083	Basically, we've chalked up numerous hours of listen time, many thanks to Danny of Surf Punk and Yamye of Asian Ska, who took the time to set up the player.
6946663	6953146	and on most occasions felt that each of the great Konami's honorable franchises has been fairly represented in regards to each other.
6953566	6960689	If the collection of 2DX music began to eclipse that of Guitar Freaks or Keyboard Mania, the system would quickly be brought back into relative balance.
6961329	6966711	Actually, I think we have more 2DX music than any of those, but... I'm pretty sure we do, but I don't know if...
6967051	6968391	But we do have a good selection of the others.
6968431	6969052	Yeah, okay.
6969592	6969912	Fair enough.
6969932	6972393	We do have a good selection of most Bomani music.
6972493	6985877	However, our society is mainly composed of poppin' music 1 through 8 fans, and out of the many times we have tuned in, we have only heard maybe two or three songs out of the well over 350 that exist, and we feel that you're not doing the license any justice.
6986297	6988238	If I could find poppin' music songs...
6988891	6991714	You know, I think I know a place where I can find some.
6991774	6996199	I will make it my mission to download plenty of pop music stuff for you guys.
6996259	6996600	Alright.
6996960	7004449	Jean-Marc of Arty Pop has been especially traumatized by the imbalance and keeps running into walls, rambling about buttons that never were.
7005149	7009395	To make a long story short, we've come to beg you to add more poppin' music tracks to the lineup.
7009855	7015823	All we ask is maybe two to three a month until the series catches up to its brethren and its long-lived potential.
7015863	7019268	We repeat, give the poppers the representation they deserve.
7020330	7021550	You asked for it, you got it.
7021690	7022811	You asked for it, you got it.
7022851	7023891	We've got the space for it.
7023951	7028812	This week on Orange Lounge, Politary is out, Poppin' Music is in.
7029232	7033053	But my personal request, we need Poppin' Music and a Melo stuff.
7033673	7036914	I have to have the Cutie Honey theme on Orange Lounge Radio.
7036934	7040355	We will make it our mission to go find ourselves some Poppin' Music.
7040835	7047157	Of course, here on Orange Lounge, we always go out and buy the legit soundtracks before we put songs into rotation.
7047357	7047817	Of course.
7048437	7054279	So we're going to go right now and order soundtracks.
7055040	7055820	We will order them.
7055980	7064424	And as soon as those ordered soundtracks are in our possession, we will rip them and play them for you.
7064524	7068165	In fact, I will have mine rushed overnight so that they get here.
7068385	7070426	We will have them rushed overnight.
7070506	7071506	Yes, we shall do that.
7072167	7073547	That's a fabulous idea.
7074287	7077869	We will make sure that they are sent by a special electronic courier.
7078709	7078969	Yes.
7080390	7081571	Yes, electronic courier.
7081631	7082372	I like that idea.
7083613	7083913	All right.
7083933	7088396	Okay, I'll repeat my comment.
7088597	7089197	End the show.
7089257	7090398	I have to go to the bathroom.
7090598	7095081	Okay, we're going to end the show, but I need to cue up the music real fast.
7095142	7097243	So is this tonight's fortune for you right there?
7097263	7097824	Yes, it is.
7098124	7103248	Okay, so I need to ask really fast, though, if you guys have any final thoughts.
7103708	7104809	Jamie, do you have any final thoughts?
7105612	7107193	Those taquitos were good, I have to go to the bathroom.
7107594	7109495	Alright, enjoy the bathroom.
7110256	7111477	Loki, any final thoughts from you?
7111957	7126789	Yeah, I just looked up one of the older games I used to play, which was One Must Fall, and they're making a sequel to it, so just go check out onemustfall.com, or omf.com, and check out One Must Fall Battlegrounds, which is pretty sweet.
7127069	7128410	Is that the old school epic game?
7128670	7136776	Yes, the old school epic game they're turning into a 16 player deathmatch giant robot fighting game that's going to be fucking awesome.
7137076	7137876	Holy crap.
7138837	7139678	So go check it out.
7139858	7141659	OMF.com Alright.
7142620	7146102	My final thought is I don't really have one.
7146142	7147023	I need a date still.
7147403	7148464	That's my final thought.
7149544	7150185	I guess that's it.
7150265	7151145	We at the end of the show?
7151226	7151726	Oh, you're back.
7152799	7154260	I want to hear the fortune cookie

7214000	7215401	This is insulting!
