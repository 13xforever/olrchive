00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a videotape!

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in!

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:10,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in!

00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:16,382

6
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:18,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Boring!

7
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: This video sucks!

8
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:41,156

10
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

11
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Hide Orange Lounge radio from the fucking children.

12
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:52,248
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,452
[SPEAKER_01]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

15
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:15,098
[SPEAKER_05]: My kind of people, and assholes.

16
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:16,219
[SPEAKER_05]: One.

17
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:18,501
[SPEAKER_05]: One.

18
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: He's good.

19
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:22,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Mischief by that much.

20
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:24,308
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Dr. Evil's cat.

21
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:25,269
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you tell?

22
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I never forget a pussy.

23
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

24
00:01:54,013 --> 00:02:12,005
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 18 for November the 3rd of 2002.

25
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:22,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny, during the intro in here, if you sit in the studio, when it comes to that part where it goes, My girlfriend's got 37 dicks, everybody in the room all at once goes, Try not to suck any dick on the way to the parking lot.

26
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:22,732

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our sim god, Loki.

[SPEAKER_07]: He's our pet brownie.

38
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave brought us brownies tonight.

39
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,829
[SPEAKER_04]: People are buying us crap tonight.

40
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting pizza from Loki.

41
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,430
[SPEAKER_04]: We got spongy brownies from Dave.

42
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Does life get any better than this?

43
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have Propella.

44
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:05,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Life is good.

45
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Except that stupid fly needs to get the hell out of here.

46
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lady who swallowed a fly.

47
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:14,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why she swallowed a fly.

48
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's doing this whole karate kid thing here, trying to catch the fly.

49
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:24,646
[SPEAKER_07]: For our listeners, a fly has made it into the studio and it's going to die sometime during the duration of the show.

50
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,937
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.

51
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we're going to take an opening break, and we're going to play a bunch of stuff from Max USA, because that is the big news this week.

52
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:38,358
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Max USA finally hits shelves this week.

53
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:45,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of surprises in there, including a lot of really great new tunes, and we're going to play some of those for you right now.

54
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go on Orange Lounge Radio, a whole block of Max USA songs, and we'll be right back to talk about Max USA.

55
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,475
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a long way to go, honey.

56
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:32,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

57
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm afraid.

58
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we going?

59
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Into the dark, black forest.

60
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We interrupt this music for a special announcement.

61
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki has killed the fly.

62
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,517
He has dropped the bomb.

63
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:46,273
The Closest Diner, what it takes is a service call, we make a few mistakes, what we gotta do is so momentum, if we need the right tools and best, it's right the way, it's not copy the rhythm of the market, it's just we gotta get with it, the rain is setting on my car, you can do it now, you're not the mango collar, yes I already hate that ball, I'm using it to call the rock and ball, yeah, rock and ball, rock and ball.

64
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,670
Thanks for watching!

65
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:12,204
[SPEAKER_03]: This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

66
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch all your favorite monster hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki, engage in the Bomani Battle Royale.

67
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,709
[SPEAKER_03]: This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, at 7 p.m.

68
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific Time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.

69
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,251
[SPEAKER_03]: May I be suitable for children under six, pregnant women, retards, and residents of all.

70
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:31,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?

71
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready for the race, are you?

72
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:40,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You're already listening to Orange Lounge Live Radio, but I hadn't played that promo yet during the live show, so I thought I would.

73
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,494
[SPEAKER_07]: What do six-year-olds and retards have to do with it?

74
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:46,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I just decided I'd be random.

75
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:49,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you listen very carefully, it also says residents of Baltimore.

76
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:55,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're picking on Baltimore because when I pulled up the stats for what cities listen to us the most, Baltimore was in last place.

77
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're picking on them.

78
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a bummer because Baltimore is where all the John Waters films are set.

79
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you know me, I love John Waters, so...

80
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:10,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the Max USA crap that we just played for you.

81
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't crap, it was more like diarrhea.

82
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:17,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Max USA just came out this week and we're all happy happy.

83
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really special.

84
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:26,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed we have a lot of new people listening tonight, so I thought I'd point out some things for you.

85
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:30,885
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join our chat room, just go to any Other Side IRC server.

86
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to just put in your server as irc.eggheads.org, or you're going to put in karma.othersideirc.net, either one of those.

87
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:43,189
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where all the big Mamani chat rooms are, and you're just going to join Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.

88
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the cool kids hang out.

89
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

90
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,952
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're too lazy to get on IRC, that's cool.

91
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:52,835
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making an effort to keep our Yahoo box online while we're doing the show.

92
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:53,916
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can just shoot us an email.

93
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

94
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:55,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all one word.

95
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,339
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and we'll check that box throughout the show.

96
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for all the cool kids in the email.

97
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:01,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

98
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,042
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to be a cool kid, don't you?

99
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're talking about, you know, station news and events, as you noticed in the beginning of the show, we have decided to make Loki an official co-host now.

100
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,561
[SPEAKER_07]: May as well, he's here all the time.

101
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:22,366
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this guy shows up, he sits over here, he gives commentary, we give him a segment.

102
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:23,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even let him sit in a chair.

103
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:25,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, ask it over.

104
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,100
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it!

105
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like last week, there's people outside the studio here fucking honking at the neighbors.

106
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care!

107
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up!

108
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my gun?

109
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom!

110
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, now... This is my boomstick!

111
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that... God damn!

112
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody fell asleep on the horn out there.

113
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:48,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

114
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,583
We realize that your horn works, but we don't need to hear it.

115
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm very happy to be the... Oh yeah, speech, speech, speech, speech.

116
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:02,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

117
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all the little people.

118
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:05,826
[SPEAKER_02]: All the little people that support me.

119
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just me or did the horn get quieter?

120
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it died.

121
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was a pathetic horn.

122
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a fear of DS into them.

123
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:15,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my bat?

124
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:17,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

125
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:18,829
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

126
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:20,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I have neighbors, Jamie.

127
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I have neighbors.

128
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,255
[SPEAKER_07]: That horn gets a fuck you.

129
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do the fuck you's of the week a bit later.

130
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:29,799
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it stopped.

131
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It stopped.

132
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

133
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:31,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's fine now.

134
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:32,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

135
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:35,651
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

136
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,272
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Jamie can be polite, too.

137
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:38,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

138
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:40,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, did you have anything else?

139
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have said, thank you, bitches.

140
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:42,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fuck them.

141
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They started up again.

142
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:49,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish we had a microphone outside, but we don't, so the whole listening public out there is going, what the hell are they talking about?

143
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Live on the horn, Mike.

144
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie finally shut the window.

145
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:06,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, right now I'm having Dave play my DDR Max save game so he can beat my Onis.

146
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you suck at the Oni.

147
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck.

148
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Onis, okay?

149
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:15,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I incredibly hate Onis, and when I found out that you have to play the Oni courses to unlock songs, that really pissed me off.

150
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:22,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you don't have to, but if you want to get them like this month... I unlocked a song by failing one.

151
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:23,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's cool.

152
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something, that was the first thing that made me think, gosh, this game really is for Americans.

153
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:30,998
[SPEAKER_04]: That you get unlocks by failing things.

154
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, good effort.

155
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got Gradius Cyber today, yay.

156
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,888
[SPEAKER_04]: That song was Zinkonomics.

157
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I love getting unlocks from games I already own.

158
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:49,205
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my one bitch about Max USA.

159
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong, great game, pretty kick-ass.

160
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,226
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the best home releases they've done yet.

161
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:58,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I really haven't decided if I like Fifth Mix more or if I like this one more.

162
00:14:58,387 --> 00:14:59,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, it's good.

163
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:04,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely, by far, better than either of the other two games we've got so far in the U.S.

164
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:04,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

165
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been cool if they had a databank with saved edits.

166
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes Fifth stand out for me, in my opinion.

167
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:21,782
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is they would be all Konomics or DDR USA edits, which would be totally pointless because, I mean, you can't play them on the arcade machine, so that kind of sucks.

168
00:15:22,728 --> 00:15:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

169
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,289
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I don't know, it's pretty good so far.

170
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Oni courses are alright.

171
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like them.

172
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing them off heads sucks.

173
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: You just like being able to see them.

174
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:33,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if I wanted to play Oni, I could.

175
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

176
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:35,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to be there.

177
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:41,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe have, like, one song unlocked with an Oni instead of, like, you know, the two last songs.

178
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:44,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The songs you want most of all.

179
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

180
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't possibly, you know...

181
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal the steps and put them in sim files if, you know, I can't play them.

182
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:54,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Now can I?

183
00:15:55,635 --> 00:16:00,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, you want to give a plug for your big contribution to the scene this week?

184
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:11,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I would say I was helping NMR and those people, the crew of people that were supposedly making Max USA sim files.

185
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:17,883
[SPEAKER_02]: This crew seemed to have pulled out two files, while myself, in like two days, pulled out 11 files.

186
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we time you last night?

187
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:23,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It took you about a half hour to get out, you leave me alone, like all six difficulties, single and double?

188
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, singles and doubles, it took me 34 minutes.

189
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:26,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

190
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:30,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I went to bed before you finished, but... Yeah, it was fun.

191
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:33,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I also finished last night, you know, the other five.

192
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:40,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So, everything's up except for Drop the Bomb, System FX, FX Mix, and... System SF.

193
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:41,708
[SPEAKER_02]: SF, yes.

194
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Like San Francisco.

195
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

196
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,430
[SPEAKER_02]: System San Francisco Mix, and the... Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

197
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Do It Right two-step harmonized mix or whatever the hell that is.

198
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what it's called.

199
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,898
[SPEAKER_04]: The decent version of Do It Right, basically.

200
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

201
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.

202
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You like the original?

203
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:03,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the original.

204
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

205
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:04,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fan of the original.

206
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the bass in it better.

207
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:08,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

208
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

209
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:10,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm entitled to.

210
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So deal with it.

211
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You can like whatever you want, Jamie.

212
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

213
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Except let them move.

214
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,852
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's allowed to like that song except Gwen.

215
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:20,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I say so.

216
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,430
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

217
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:22,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the chick.

218
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:23,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

219
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're the chick.

220
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:25,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, the horn drove off.

221
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,315
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you looking at, Loki?

222
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:31,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's... The fly is still... Oh, he's looking to see if the pizza guy's here.

223
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:36,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fly, by the way, which we left twitching on the windowsill, has managed to slide off and is stuck to the edge of it.

224
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

225
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,523
[SPEAKER_07]: We have prop... Now the fly is actually dead.

226
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,665
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the fly's last moment on this earth.

227
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,366
[SPEAKER_04]: See you in hell, fly.

228
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,607
[SPEAKER_07]: The fly is now splattered against a propel bottle.

229
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave's back in the room.

230
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:49,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dave.

231
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:51,961
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say about Max USA, Dave?

232
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,282
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really good.

233
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:55,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Black Forest is really cool.

234
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:56,482
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

235
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do like about Max USA.

236
00:17:58,063 --> 00:17:59,263
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they did right.

237
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,244
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't just do it right.

238
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it fucking better than right.

239
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: The licensed USA tracks fucking rule.

240
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Black Forest is one of the best Bomani songs ever.

241
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will cut you if you think any different.

242
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:16,808
[SPEAKER_04]: and You Leave Me Alone is something, it sounds like it's right off like a Dance Mania album, but better.

243
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:21,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know who thought to license those songs, because I certainly never heard them before, Max USA.

244
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anybody that did know those songs.

245
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:29,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you said you thought you'd heard Dark Black Forest before, or somebody on this show said they heard that before.

246
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:29,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

247
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'd never heard it before.

248
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:31,814
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced it.

249
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very hard song to find.

250
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very concerned because the trucker there looks like a guy walked out with a bag of something and went to that other house.

251
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,079
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably cocaine, don't worry about it.

252
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But I swear, that's the one thing they did right, was those license tracks, Rule, I don't know who thought to pick those.

253
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:53,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They were cool, except for I Like To Move It, which that song sucks!

254
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,526
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hate that song!

255
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I Like To Move It, reel to reel.

256
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:02,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to say that that Move It song, yeah.

257
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:08,207
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just want to say that they could have done better on making the songs harder, though.

258
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Sandstorm, I wanted it to be hard.

259
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:15,171
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like Freeze Arrows, they went overboard on the Freeze Arrows way too much.

260
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:22,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if SCK was here right now, which he's not, so he can't bitch at us whenever we make fun of Max USA, he'd say, that's what edit mode's for.

261
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, but they went way overboard on the freeze era.

262
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,440
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, hey, we've got a new mode that we can use.

263
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me make you steps.

264
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me make you steps.

265
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:31,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

266
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:35,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Sandstorm is a cool song, but they made shitty-ass steps for it.

267
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:38,405
[SPEAKER_09]: They needed to do the do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

268
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, they were like, freeze, freeze, note, note, note, freeze.

269
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing I was disappointed in is there's no new katas.

270
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:45,929
[SPEAKER_02]: None at all.

271
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was kind of weird that there's no new katas, but I guess, you know, that's to be gentle to us, you know, stupid Americans.

272
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,870
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

273
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the fucking horn again.

274
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And I beat the adrenaline honey for Loki.

275
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Pizza.

276
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:02,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the pizza guy honking.

277
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

278
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:04,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki ran to get his pizza.

279
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll get our pizza and then shoot him.

280
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get our pizza and throw it.

281
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,114
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll pull a Braveheart on him.

282
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:12,135
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll throw artichoke hearts at the... I'm going to eat those.

283
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:20,837
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about the old... What do you think about getting old Dance Mania tracks and tracks that were licensed for Japan and getting some of those on USA?

284
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I must admit...

285
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:27,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was fucking cool that Captain Jack was on Max USA.

286
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the coolest thing ever.

287
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:30,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain Jack.

288
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I was feeling really crappy when I started playing my game, so I only thumb-bumped it and didn't get very far into it.

289
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:41,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, Brilliant to You, Orchestra Groove was on there, so that made me instantly a happy bunny.

290
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And me being the only person who likes to love that feeling, I was ecstatic to have that song in the game.

291
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:50,625
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

292
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

293
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:51,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

294
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave has just unlocked it, right?

295
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-step harmonized.

296
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:55,886
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd he do it?

297
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,948
[SPEAKER_02]: He beat the adrenaline, Oni.

298
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:58,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he really?

299
00:20:58,449 --> 00:20:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So guess what?

300
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:02,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see a sim file for that on my site tonight.

301
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

302
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:03,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

303
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:05,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard it here first, I guess.

304
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy.

305
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:17,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice the interesting use of some of the recycled videos, like how Love This Feelin' has the Let's Groove video in it?

306
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you looked into it that much.

307
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:20,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just happy it was there.

308
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:29,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was there, and I didn't want to torture him with the multi-genre, multi-tempo song, even though I like it.

309
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Twin says he loves Love This Feelin', and he made me play it on Wednesday's little thing, which is true.

310
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to think about that, because he also likes Let Them Move.

311
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:43,949
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually, you know, you've got good taste, thank you.

312
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,692
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were missing it, this is one of the reasons why you want to listen to Orange Lounge, you know, throughout the week as well.

313
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:58,336
[SPEAKER_04]: On Wednesday night, when we picked up the game, I came in here and had this elaborate setup in here, and unfortunately, Jamie was at home playing it herself, and Loki wasn't here.

314
00:21:58,536 --> 00:21:59,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie was at home sick.

315
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was at home sick and playing it for yourself.

316
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:07,362
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just got on the stream, fired up the Orange Lounge stream, and just started playing it on air and playing all the new tracks and stuff.

317
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:10,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you listen during the week, sometimes you get little surprises like that.

318
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So listen to Orange Lounge all the time.

319
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:19,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I would still like to say that I'm still having an open commission, I guess, for someone to make me Dynamite R5.

320
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that JB made you that one.

321
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:27,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... In the way that you imagined it in your head.

322
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,007
[SPEAKER_07]: A professionally styled mixed one.

323
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:30,327
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't like JB's version?

324
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:32,088
[SPEAKER_07]: It was special.

325
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:32,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, JB.

326
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:34,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It was special.

327
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not quite the way I envisioned it to be.

328
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we actually play that on a show?

329
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:39,691
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

330
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, then maybe we ought to play that later.

331
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

332
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:43,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I still have it.

333
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:43,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I do.

334
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:44,293
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

335
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You made JB cry.

336
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:49,115
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't cry.

337
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:57,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I, look, it was good, but it's not how I envisioned it.

338
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you'd have to sort of read my mind.

339
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, new one.

340
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

341
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: New one.

342
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, a new one.

343
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,323
[SPEAKER_07]: What's a good one that will work?

344
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:11,045
[SPEAKER_07]: How about mixing Holic.

345
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:11,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Holic.

346
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:14,227
[SPEAKER_07]: With...

347
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:16,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Stoic.

348
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,180
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not stoic.

349
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Missholic with, Mixholic with, um, um, um, um, um, Gentle Stress.

350
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:29,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Holic doesn't really mix, though, because it's, uh, different measures.

351
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:31,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on seven.

352
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, it's seven, eight.

353
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Era with Gentle Stress.

354
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:35,304
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

355
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Gentle Era.

356
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:40,345
[SPEAKER_04]: The Era-sensual mix.

357
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:48,359
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone can make me a good mix of era and gentle stress, I'll give you a dollar.

358
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:52,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can't use the word sexual in a game, we have to use sensual.

359
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses me off, because that's why they can't license any erotic songs.

360
00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:00,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember saying on DDR Freak a while back, why not just call him exotic?

361
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:05,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think somebody ran with that, I've heard that used again lately, but you know.

362
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:07,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

363
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I really would want to see something like Kiss Me or Temple of Love in DDR.

364
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be rad.

365
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:15,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've already seen those songs in DDR.

366
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:24,757
[SPEAKER_07]: A year and a half before I had even heard of DDR, there was a song that my friend sent me called Don't Talk Dirty, which was the very first erotic song I ever heard.

367
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:27,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like that to be in DDR.

368
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That song owns.

369
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:28,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll play that later.

370
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We have it.

371
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:30,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have it.

372
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,782
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make me a happy bunny.

373
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to put Lollipop in DDR Lollipop, Lollipop No, not that No, the DJ Alligator Project Lollipop Suck on my lollipop, I wanna lick it Last week on Orange Lounge Hunters I'll bring that song, it's awesome Black Lab has announced he'd like to see Dr. Dick in DDR Help me, Dr. Dick

374
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, don't have sex with your ex.

375
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they have the 2003 one or 2002 version of that.

376
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:08,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, on the new Dance Mania Red, or not Red, uh, EX.

377
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:09,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Mania EX one.

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Dance Mania Extreme!

379
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:20,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I still fear that, you know, I hope what Dan said doesn't come to pass for DDR.

380
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:20,574
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

381
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:27,537
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, once they release a series of games, then add Extreme to the end of the most recent release, that means the series is about to die.

382
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's coming, it's gotta be the final.

383
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:31,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

384
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:41,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it had to be like, you know, DDR extreme, super duper extreme, fun, dance party, final mix, too.

385
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:45,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that, I don't know.

386
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:48,073
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, DDR happy crack mix, and have it all happy hardcore.

387
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:48,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye!

388
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play some Tetris, motherfucker

389
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, could that mean that they're going to be starting over with some new kind of dance game?

390
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God's 8-panel DDR or something?

391
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR 2DX?

392
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:27,405
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

393
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: No, then we'd have Technomotion.

394
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:32,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

395
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is the pizza here?

396
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it wasn't.

397
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was a false alarm.

398
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:40,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

399
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Dick with the horn.

400
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:42,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

401
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Dick with the horn.

402
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't honked in a while, though.

403
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:51,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but if he does it next week, I swear I'm going to go over there and cut off his hands.

404
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if he uses his head, I'll just cut that off too.

405
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll make him eat it.

406
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

407
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we hear a yes from the other room.

408
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:04,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wonder what Dave got.

409
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:05,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave might unlock something else.

410
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

411
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other thoughts you have on Max Rosen?

412
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:11,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty.

413
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:24,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, I have to give a big pile, you know, a big six-bar box of kudos to Jason Enos for those funny little blurbs whenever you unlock a song.

414
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whenever you play a song.

415
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:48,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some it works with the unlocks, but I think that it's mainly when you actually play the song.

416
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:50,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to read one of them.

417
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:51,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so hilarious.

418
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:52,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can find it.

419
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:56,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do have it.

420
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:56,935
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one.

421
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is for when you unlock So In Love.

422
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:07,661
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, You have unlocked the song So In Love by Caramel S, oozing with stories of love just like melted caramel over a hot flame.

423
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:13,924
[SPEAKER_04]: This down-tempo song has elements of 70s pop, smooth jazz, and lounge all rolled into every bite.

424
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:14,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yum!

425
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:16,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so cool.

426
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:17,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite.

427
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that they have yum.

428
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,267
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so cool.

429
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Three little letters add so much.

430
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:24,148
[SPEAKER_04]: They really do.

431
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:26,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there another one I have here?

432
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, this is another one that's very popular.

433
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is already posted on some message boards.

434
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,771
[SPEAKER_04]: You have failed game mode for the first time.

435
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:37,593
[SPEAKER_04]: As a result, you have unlocked the song Celebrate by JJ Company.

436
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:38,753
Celebrate.

437
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:44,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can celebrate your first failure in style, but don't give up on your dream to be the ultimate dancer.

438
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, is one of the most god-awful songs I've ever heard in DDR.

439
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Celebrate!

440
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:53,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Celebrate!

441
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:54,464
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

442
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:58,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is information mode when you... Oh, anyways.

443
00:28:58,446 --> 00:28:59,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll play that later, too.

444
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll play Celebrate just to torture everybody.

445
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:06,031
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he just beat Candy on quarter stage, so I unlocked Candy.

446
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:06,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, cool.

447
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's playing home base, the Oni, the 17 song Oni.

448
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:12,055
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you get when you beat that, though?

449
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:12,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you get a...

450
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:18,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's, um... Is there anything else you haven't unlocked yet?

451
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Spin the Disc.

452
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:20,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Spin the Disc, that's a good one.

453
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Spin the Disc, and the last one's Drop the Bomb.

454
00:29:23,045 --> 00:29:24,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's Drop the Bomb, you never know.

455
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop the Bomb is in this one.

456
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:29,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed online.

457
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,810
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to beat the 21 song order to get it.

458
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:39,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it starts off with a three-footer, and the highest thing is, uh... The hardest song in there is gonna be Midnight Blaze, Maniac.

459
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:41,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

460
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:45,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Tal says that failing an Oni gets you gentle stress.

461
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:46,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's true.

462
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:55,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a really funny information that says, like, Oni mode can be so stressful, but, you know, smooth out with a sensual song.

463
00:29:55,427 --> 00:30:00,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember that one because, of course, I failed my Oni on the first song because I don't like Onis.

464
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:02,912
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

465
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferret hates them, too.

466
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:07,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Arrgh.

467
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Arrgh.

468
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anything that you wish you would have seen on Max USA that didn't end up making it?

469
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemesis?

470
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:19,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what happened to those songs?

471
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:23,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember on an early list, we had Nemesis, we had a remix of Superstar, didn't we?

472
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:28,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not at all unhappy that the Superstar remix is not there.

473
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:29,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you hate that remix.

474
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:32,364
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the one, the M2 step from Six Style?

475
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:34,284
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an M2 step, I believe that was supposed to be in there too.

476
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:35,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what happened to those.

477
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I think More Deep was on there too.

478
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I don't remember.

479
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see what else was supposed to be on there.

480
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

481
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:52,038
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess, if anything, since, you know, they probably did have some data for those, Max too, that's all.

482
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:53,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be interesting.

483
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:58,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe somebody can go into the disc and see if they can find images for Nemesis and things like that.

484
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised nobody's thought to go in and see if those are in there.

485
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people have thought about it.

486
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they're working on it right now.

487
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:10,705
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy that I talked to on DDR Maniacs that was doing, like, hex editing on there.

488
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, like, a cracker at one time, so he's, you know... Cracker!

489
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,728
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

490
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:24,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's supposed to be going in there to rip the high quality backgrounds and stuff and the videos.

491
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see that.

492
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool if they could find that stuff.

493
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:33,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Because didn't somebody go into USA Mix and actually found a bad girl's background without the gun?

494
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like that.

495
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:44,364
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also, with the aid of GameShark with Konomics, they found modes that were in the fourth mix.

496
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because they basically ripped a fourth mix, right?

497
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:49,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they found all of the challenge mode and things like that.

498
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:52,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of sad that Challenge Mode didn't make it into Max.

499
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenge Mode was evil.

500
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:56,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's what they kind of called Oni Mode.

501
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always fun.

502
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,369
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a challenging mode.

503
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:00,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I just love the picture.

504
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:01,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to cry about it.

505
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, there's STDs in DDR Max.

506
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:11,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice though that when you're actually playing the game that it still has the little characters, the Asian ones?

507
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:11,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

508
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy, huh?

509
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:13,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

510
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:15,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, whoops, somebody got lazy.

511
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And also on the high score screens it says DDR6.

512
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:25,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's kind of so subtle because it kind of goes with the whole little theme, the modernization theme they had going with that.

513
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really notice it.

514
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's still cool.

515
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get us wrong.

516
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:34,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just glad that, you know, they would have had to put it on a DVD for as much crap as they put in there.

517
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:34,332
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.

518
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:35,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on DVD.

519
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:36,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean crap in a positive sense.

520
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:37,394
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was nice crap.

521
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:42,396
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it fertilizes your, you know, music addiction.

522
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other thing, the thing that kind of also disappointed me about Max USA is that the box, the back of the box says something like it links up with Konomics for special stuff.

523
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:57,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically what it means, and when you read it in the manual, you can load your edits from Konomics.

524
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

525
00:32:58,565 --> 00:32:59,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

526
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, but they just wouldn't show up.

527
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I was kind of laughing at the whole time while playing DDR Max was how much they're advertising for Konomics.

528
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,629
[SPEAKER_02]: In the information screen, it's like, Go buy!

529
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy Konomics!

530
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy it!

531
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:33,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

532
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:33,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Go!

533
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:34,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Go!

534
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:38,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Konomics is probably down to $19.99 by now, right?

535
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the PS1 games are.

536
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:44,100
[SPEAKER_07]: At last check, Konomics was at $29.99 at GameStop.

537
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine eventually it'll probably go down to $19.99 though, right?

538
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: As most of the PS1 games probably will.

539
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, but it still sells.

540
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:52,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.

541
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:54,466
[SPEAKER_04]: No question about it.

542
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:59,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're hooking new people onto DDR, I suppose why not let them know that Konomics is out there?

543
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they didn't try to sell any copies of USA Mix, but that's okay because USA Mix was kind of crappy.

544
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It was better than I would have expected for a first release.

545
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, if you keep in mind, they were testing the waters.

546
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,915
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, Konami had little faith.

547
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:24,514
[SPEAKER_07]: The DDR was going to be that big as it is now.

548
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:28,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've noticed each release has been progressively better.

549
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:31,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have exactly just about the same copy.

550
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,137
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a better one that was released in Japan.

551
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:37,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree to an extent about the first mix.

552
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:44,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they kind of should have already known from success in the arcades, from rabid followings such as DDR Freak, things like that.

553
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,364
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that import machines are more popular than the U.S.

554
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,789
[SPEAKER_04]: machines, I kind of would have expected a little bit more faith.

555
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,211
[SPEAKER_07]: But they really didn't have that much.

556
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,654
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the fact of the matter.

557
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:55,154
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't.

558
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:56,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It took convincing.

559
00:34:56,356 --> 00:34:58,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have it now.

560
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:05,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney Mix, on the other hand, was an improvement over the Japanese one, I thought.

561
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:06,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

562
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It was missing some of the good songs, but it had Maniac Mode.

563
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:13,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked playing the oldies.

564
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:16,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I loved playing Mr. Bassman.

565
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved playing Surfing USA.

566
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the Macarena, though.

567
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of understand, you know, why they couldn't license them, though.

568
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it makes sense.

569
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:25,053
[SPEAKER_07]: They took out Fire.

570
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:28,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that they do... Not Fire, they took out Electric Light Parade.

571
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they took out the Electric Light Parade, which is great.

572
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:31,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the one I liked.

573
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:35,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hope if they do do a Disney mix, too, that we'll get the catch-up song.

574
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,364
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

575
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:37,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

576
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:39,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

577
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:39,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss battle.

578
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:40,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss dance battles.

579
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Battle, Dance Battle from Second Mix, Dance Magic I actually almost missed couple steps Having couple steps, like Second Mix was the last one to happen that I understand Didn't Third?

580
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:20,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe not Well, I mean, you can always do couples edits But it's not the same You know, I miss going up to a DDR machine and having to tell it to do verses

581
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:32,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember going up to the 1.5 and holding my buttons down so I could play in versus mode so that we could have the same nifty little steps.

582
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of miss it.

583
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:38,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost miss having to stomp around and do a code to put in Maniac.

584
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:45,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss being totally messed up when USA came out because I was so used to playing on flat.

585
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

586
00:36:48,089 --> 00:37:12,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, we're going to take a real quick break, and then we're going to come back, we'll talk a little bit more about MaxUSA, we'll talk about some other stuff, you know, while MaxUSA has been kind of taking all the news, kind of taking everyone's attention lately, there's been other news going on too, so we'll get to that, and a whole lot more, we've got a listless segment for you guys tonight, so do stay tuned, and we will be right back for you guys.

587
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:18,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to start this off with a song that we kind of referenced a little bit during this last break.

588
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:19,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

589
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:25,856
Thanks for watching!

590
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:27,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction When we get into action but don't talk dirty Take me in your arms and go for my obsession Give me all your passion, don't talk dirty to me Oh touch me, don't talk dirty to me

00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:20,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, cool.

655
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take another break pretty soon then.

656
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:29,164
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those that cannot make Shaft, because we know that we're an international show at this point.

657
00:47:29,184 --> 00:47:30,564
[SPEAKER_04]: We have lots of listeners in Japan.

00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:32,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot for listening.

661
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:38,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And where else do we have a lot of listeners I've been noticing?

00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,582
[SPEAKER_04]: or your computer room or wherever you have your computer.

666
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:02,665
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be broadcasting live from Shaft all day long.

667
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:07,669
[SPEAKER_04]: The stream will start probably before the doors even open sometime at 9 or 10 in the morning.

668
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,150
[SPEAKER_07]: We might get bored once we have everything set up.

669
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we might get bored once everything's set up.

670
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll sing a little song.

671
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to pretty much be in charge of this because Jamie's kind of the queen of the tournament so she's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off making sure everything's in order.

672
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:21,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the empress, what you talking about?

673
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,502
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm going to be kind of emceeing the tournament with my buddy Tal.

674
00:48:25,562 --> 00:48:27,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be up there doing the emcee duties.

675
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:31,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So when Tal's doing the emcee stuff though, I'll be in the back helping Loki out with interviews.

676
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty much it's all going to be on Loki.

677
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome aboard as co-hosts.

678
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Now do eight hours of radio all by yourself.

679
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:39,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

680
00:48:39,435 --> 00:48:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta catch up.

681
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:41,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

682
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, anybody who wants to, as you come off the stage from Perfect Attack, from Freestyle, whatever... What?

683
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:51,768
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

684
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Accuracy Attack.

685
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta get in the habit, too.

686
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:56,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, this ain't your mama's Perfect Attack.

687
00:48:57,412 --> 00:49:04,498
[SPEAKER_04]: As they come off the stage from Accuracy Attack, or Freestyle, or A-Team Freestyle... You just so sounded like Cartman.

688
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: A-Team.

689
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

690
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling it Perfect Attack if I want to, bitch!

691
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

692
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:16,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez, Carmen!

693
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: As you guys finish, you can just walk right into the room.

694
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:25,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be escorted into the office and get the shit beaten out of you.

695
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:25,880
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

696
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll be able to be interviewed.

697
00:49:27,642 --> 00:49:29,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Forge Lounge will tell all your friends to listen.

698
00:49:30,483 --> 00:49:33,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are there at the event, you can't listen, that's okay.

699
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:37,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll rebroadcast it probably at least twice on the station at some point.

700
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:38,969
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can get it to archive.

701
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't guarantee it'll be rebroadcasted, though.

702
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We might not be able to get it to archive.

703
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:43,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've just got to...

704
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:46,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Get you guys all to listen on Saturday if you can.

705
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

706
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:49,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:50,897

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I burped.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be there judging.

711
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:01,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're doing the A-Team stuff, right?

712
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:02,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to plan.

714
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:05,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

715
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:07,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to do interviews while you're judging for A-Team?

716
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:09,871
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Rice Princess?

717
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:10,111

00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:30,877
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

739
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:56,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at, or AA in this case, I'm looking at the blink of an arrow a lot of the time to get the tempo, so I would kind of be fucked in that aspect, so it makes it a little more difficult.

740
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:58,630
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I would love to see you try to do something in Dark Reverse.

741
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sucks that I'm going to be up there doing, I can't participate because I already know all the songs.

742
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,354
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be at Scandia before then.

743
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:09,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see you take the shaft challenge.

744
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:11,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can handle shafts.

745
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:13,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if you can get the shaft.

746
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might like getting, anyway.

747
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:20,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Whale.

748
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:20,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Whale.

749
00:52:20,783 --> 00:52:21,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that special?

750
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:24,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Accuracy Attack, very game show.

751
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:30,605
[SPEAKER_04]: The way we've got the brackets set up, very suspenseful, at least as much as a DDR tournament can be.

752
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:33,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't rely on what we've named the categories.

753
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:35,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got category names are starting to float around out there.

754
00:52:36,747 --> 00:52:37,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows.

755
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I say three people, I believe, on the planet know.

756
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:41,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally three people know.

757
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally three people know what are in those envelopes.

758
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:46,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And only two of us actually have them written down.

759
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:49,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and only two of us actually were there to write them down.

760
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:53,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Scandia doesn't know what's in those envelopes?

761
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

762
00:52:55,299 --> 00:52:57,641
[SPEAKER_04]: The best PA-ers in the nation don't know what's in those envelopes?

763
00:52:57,781 --> 00:52:59,202
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't be told either.

764
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,084
[SPEAKER_07]: You can try bribing me.

765
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:02,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It ain't gonna work.

766
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:05,667
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm like, let one song out for $90.

767
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:08,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to wear a big sequined jacket to do the MC.

768
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:11,131
[SPEAKER_07]: You totally need to do the Rod Roddy outfit.

769
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:12,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on down!

770
00:53:13,432 --> 00:53:14,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down!

771
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:14,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

772
00:53:15,494 --> 00:53:18,416
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna take a really quick break because there's food here and we want to get some food.

773
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna play some Groovalicious 70s tune to get everybody in the mood for a shaft.

774
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll come back and we're gonna talk some more about some other DDR things going on.

775
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,604
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you guys can tune in on Saturday

776
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday, starting at around 9 to 10 a.m.

777
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Big Shaft livestream.

00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

779
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:36,631
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:38,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

782
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,452
[SPEAKER_14]: And now DJ, let's start rocking it, rocking it, rocking it

783
00:57:24,716 --> 00:57:29,319
Whoa, hello, sorry gang, that's a bad mp3, so we're gonna just go right into the next song, sorry about that

784
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,318
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

785
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:35,632
Thank you for watching!

786
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:31,758
and many more.

787
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:28,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream The best thing for you, no, you can count on me, believe me There's a lovin' lady, you know what you found in me

788
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:57,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

789
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:04,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

790
01:01:04,586 --> 01:01:11,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just talking about Sak Bamani hosting another fabulous tournament, also known as Shapt, which is going to happen this Saturday.

791
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty soon already.

792
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:14,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

793
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:15,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it's already here.

794
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:16,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy shit.

795
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:18,365
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Max USA DDR Max USA

796
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: All that they did was, Max 2 has been announced for the Japanese system, so we know that for a fact.

797
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:50,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And now where people are getting their information is from GameFacts.com, and they said that it's been announced.

798
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:52,563
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I don't think it's credible at all.

799
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, there probably will be one.

800
01:01:56,945 --> 01:01:57,966
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it hasn't been announced.

801
01:01:58,973 --> 01:01:59,273
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

802
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:00,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling the angst in this room.

803
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

804
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:22,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking it's about time.

805
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:24,041
[SPEAKER_04]: What, we're going to do some FUs?

806
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:25,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's do some FUs.

807
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:27,366
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week.

808
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the part where Jamie likes to go off and F something.

809
01:02:33,644 --> 01:02:36,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had to go off and say, fuck them.

810
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck them right in their nose, because their ear and their ass aren't good enough.

811
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and if you want to send your FUs of the week, just send them to me over in the chat room.

812
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: You can PM me over in the chat room, and we already had some people do that.

813
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can alternatively send us an email, but you've got to do it right now, because we only do this segment for a little bit.

814
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:58,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.

815
01:02:58,661 --> 01:02:59,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

816
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:04,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my first one of the week.

817
01:03:04,419 --> 01:03:06,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's the fly, but the fly's dead.

818
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,841
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the asshole with his horn, and I hope he dies.

819
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I said what mine was going to be in the car, didn't I?

820
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:14,623
[SPEAKER_07]: On the way over here?

821
01:03:15,263 --> 01:03:16,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, license plate.

822
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:17,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, okay.

823
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:23,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan comes home last night and proceeds to tell me that our license plate is missing off of our car.

824
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nowhere to be found in the parking lot.

825
01:03:27,447 --> 01:03:29,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And the whole plate around...

826
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,053
[SPEAKER_07]: The license plate is missing.

827
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:38,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're thinking it's either been stolen or has just fallen off, although it's kind of funny that two screws would fall off at once.

828
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:47,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this actually, my fucker of the week is in, you know, for my man's benefit, that he has to spend however many hours at the DMV tomorrow to get that replaced.

829
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,160
[SPEAKER_07]: My poor sweetheart.

830
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:52,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to hear about it all back tomorrow, too.

831
01:03:52,682 --> 01:03:54,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the worst part, is that now you have to deal with the bitching.

832
01:03:54,603 --> 01:03:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Drive your ass to work, and then go to the DMV, and then come back and work.

833
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:01,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, oh my god.

834
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:06,208
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some days that we don't let the line move at all, we call those weekdays.

835
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:08,221
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

836
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:14,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, another fuck you of the week goes to this cold that just seems to be refusing to leave me.

837
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:19,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at the dead tail end of it and I'm still getting all I want to do is sleep.

838
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:20,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking a nap.

839
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:22,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, but yeah.

840
01:04:22,986 --> 01:04:26,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're not very big, powerful, evil fuck yous, but they are, so fuck you.

841
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:28,488
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those things.

842
01:04:28,508 --> 01:04:29,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

843
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:31,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, thank you for people.

844
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all your FUs of the week?

845
01:04:33,817 --> 01:04:34,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

846
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucked up.

847
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

848
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:37,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it from Loki.

849
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,019
[SPEAKER_04]: You got any FUs of the week?

850
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:41,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new song.

851
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you do.

852
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:49,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I called this actually before the show, so for people that were recommending it during the show, I beat you to it.

853
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:57,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first FU of the week goes to Konami and DDR Max USA.

854
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:00,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Onis.

855
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:02,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, people like Onis.

856
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:03,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Onis.

857
01:05:03,434 --> 01:05:05,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the fact I have to play Onis to unlock songs.

858
01:05:06,295 --> 01:05:06,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

859
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to.

860
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

861
01:05:09,377 --> 01:05:09,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

862
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:11,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just play the game for months on end.

863
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck that.

864
01:05:12,178 --> 01:05:15,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got other games that came out the same week, like Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

865
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beckoning my attention and not playing this stupid game constantly.

866
01:05:20,202 --> 01:05:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I've double-a'd almost everything on Heavy.

867
01:05:22,843 --> 01:05:28,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to fucking double-a everything in this whole game and still be playing and songs are still not unlocked.

868
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:29,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucked up.

869
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:35,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave just beat, you know, the home base, you know, course, and the new Hardcore 21 still hasn't been unlocked.

870
01:05:35,528 --> 01:05:37,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I gotta play some more songs.

871
01:05:37,128 --> 01:05:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

872
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't unlock Hardcore 21?

873
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:39,609
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't unlock that at all.

874
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:43,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I gotta play about 500 more songs before that fucking thing gets undone.

875
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to see the Drop the Bomb remix, finally.

876
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

877
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me add that the Drop the Bomb remix, while the song is cool to step, suck ass, and the backgrounds, they took no time whatsoever to make that background.

878
01:05:57,134 --> 01:06:03,156
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yellow stick, you'll drop the bomb, background, and put System SF Remix on there.

879
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:04,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-dee-doo.

880
01:06:04,957 --> 01:06:06,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's my complaint.

881
01:06:07,737 --> 01:06:11,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Brilliant to You, when they put out the orchestra groove, they just made it in pink.

882
01:06:12,859 --> 01:06:14,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But they changed colors, at least.

883
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit, they didn't do anything for this.

884
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, yeah, that's my complaint there.

885
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The Onis, you know... Oh, that's another thing.

886
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:21,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Part 421.

887
01:06:22,887 --> 01:06:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a 40-minute Oni, so if I fuck it up like 30 minutes into it, I gotta play it again?

888
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

889
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:29,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna do that.

890
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:39,238
[SPEAKER_02]: No one should have to play a 40-minute Oni, and that and the fact, who's actually gonna have a homepad responsive enough to actually play a 40-minute Oni on a homepad?

891
01:06:41,383 --> 01:06:43,885
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably have to go through a couple of homepads while playing.

892
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:47,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you've burned out a whole new one just from playing that game.

893
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:51,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I would feel bad for anybody trying to do that, like, not on a controller or whatever.

894
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:54,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on a controller, your freaking hands are going to cramp up, too.

895
01:06:54,474 --> 01:06:59,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, F Konami for their... I mean, I like the fact that they put Onis in there.

896
01:06:59,098 --> 01:06:59,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

897
01:06:59,878 --> 01:07:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But what the hell are you thinking, putting 21-song Onis and 17-song Onis?

898
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just ridiculous.

899
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:07,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like my 100-minute-long Oni.

900
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, does Dave have an FU?

901
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:12,821
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

902
01:07:13,582 --> 01:07:16,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is better.

903
01:07:17,643 --> 01:07:21,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So, my FU also goes to Max USA, even though I've just played it like half an hour ago.

904
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Also towards the Onis, but for a different reason.

905
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:28,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I like them, but damn, I've got like Carpal Tunnel now.

906
01:07:29,228 --> 01:07:29,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

907
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just that, it's the fact that the backgrounds are really bright and really flashy, and so my eyes are really... You can turn that down in the options screen, you know?

908
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:43,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that after like three minutes, and I'm not going to go start over again.

909
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:48,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, to start over I have to play all the other songs again, I'm not going to do that shit.

910
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:53,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So, FU, Oni, on Max USA.

911
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:54,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

912
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:57,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you unlock Hardcore 21?

913
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:02,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to basically give head to DDR Max USA.

914
01:08:03,231 --> 01:08:03,892
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be hard.

915
01:08:03,912 --> 01:08:06,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially since it doesn't have either.

916
01:08:09,738 --> 01:08:10,599
[SPEAKER_04]: My FUs of the week.

917
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few, I guess.

918
01:08:14,143 --> 01:08:15,825
[SPEAKER_04]: My first FU of the week goes to Jamie.

919
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,247
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

920
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:19,849
[SPEAKER_04]: For getting me addicted to Animal Crossing.

921
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:20,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You bitch.

922
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:23,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have to go spend money on a GameCube.

923
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so I can have those annoying little assholes move into my neighborhood.

924
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:29,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob lives in my neighborhood.

925
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:31,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And an F you to Belle the cow.

926
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:33,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You bitch, I hate you.

927
01:08:33,293 --> 01:08:34,313
[SPEAKER_07]: What did Belle do to you?

928
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:36,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Belle's the nice one, Petunia's the bitch.

929
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, an F you to Petunia, she sucks too.

930
01:08:38,935 --> 01:08:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And an F you to Mallory because she won't move out of our town.

931
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:44,899
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Rob sent me fruit.

932
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I mailed... He sent me an apple.

933
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I mailed Jamie some fruit, and I mailed Dan some fruit, which he got.

934
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:53,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan sent you clothes.

935
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dan sent me clothes.

936
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent you rags.

937
01:08:56,392 --> 01:08:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F Jamie for getting me hooked on that crack rock.

938
01:09:00,797 --> 01:09:02,399
[SPEAKER_04]: My other F you goes to Psychos.

939
01:09:03,624 --> 01:09:06,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Psycho is online that want me to do dirty things on my webcam.

940
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:07,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck.

941
01:09:07,288 --> 01:09:07,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away.

942
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:08,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like you.

943
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop messaging me.

944
01:09:11,112 --> 01:09:11,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop mailing me.

945
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:12,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad.

946
01:09:14,415 --> 01:09:15,296
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to stalkers.

947
01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a difference between showing a little attention.

948
01:09:20,341 --> 01:09:22,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We like attention, but stalking, no.

949
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop stalking, please.

950
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:23,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad.

951
01:09:24,064 --> 01:09:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate when I get runs in my stalkers.

952
01:09:29,136 --> 01:09:30,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all my FUs.

953
01:09:30,136 --> 01:09:31,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I really have anything else.

954
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:33,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll think of something later.

955
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:37,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, FU to myself for sleeping through half of Halloween.

956
01:09:38,858 --> 01:09:45,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And FU, FU just like last week, FU to all my friends who get drunk while I have to drive.

957
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:45,940
[SPEAKER_04]: FU.

958
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:46,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

959
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom FUs.

960
01:09:52,944 --> 01:09:54,605
[SPEAKER_04]: My god, Twen, you've got too damn many.

961
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only reading your last three.

962
01:09:56,246 --> 01:10:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Twen says, F you, uh, from the manager to a dumbass.

963
01:10:00,609 --> 01:10:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be hard.

964
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seventh mix.

965
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Twen says, F you to another dumbass.

966
01:10:04,572 --> 01:10:05,872
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I hate that song.

967
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:06,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Every song he picks.

968
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:08,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that.

969
01:10:09,475 --> 01:10:10,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, F you to Konami.

970
01:10:10,435 --> 01:10:12,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to release more PS1 DDR titles in the U.S.

971
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:15,664
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackLapSaga

972
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:39,467
[SPEAKER_04]: F his roommate and his now girlfriend for once again getting naughty while he was in the room.

973
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:47,191
[SPEAKER_04]: They went a bit further this time because moaning was heard, even over his headphones, and they ignored him when he threw a bottle at them to get them to stop.

974
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:51,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that was my suggestion last night in the chatroom, to throw a bottle or poke him with a stick.

975
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going for more of the poking with a stick.

976
01:10:54,855 --> 01:10:56,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time, set them on fire.

977
01:10:57,236 --> 01:10:57,977
[SPEAKER_07]: See if they notice.

978
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, F everything that contributed to his inability to go to Shaft this Saturday.

979
01:11:03,504 --> 01:11:07,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, he will be paintballing for his birthday, and he will not be able to listen to the broadcast.

980
01:11:07,786 --> 01:11:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's your choice, buddy.

981
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:17,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck his left side shift key for sticking so much lately, and fuck the fact that I still have no car.

982
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of you know what I mean by that, and if you don't, too bad.

983
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:21,959
[SPEAKER_04]: You should hang out in the channel more.

984
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,400
[SPEAKER_04]: More Than Jay.

985
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that slash emote sex doesn't work in real life.

986
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never used a slash emote.

987
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:31,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's... No.

988
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an AOL thing?

989
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:33,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

990
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:34,182
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

991
01:11:36,283 --> 01:11:39,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And being sick and depressed sucks hard, so fuck that.

992
01:11:39,204 --> 01:11:39,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

993
01:11:39,584 --> 01:11:39,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

994
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:40,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

995
01:11:40,104 --> 01:11:41,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what sucks worse than that?

996
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:42,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Get back to my music for a minute.

997
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:43,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

998
01:11:43,285 --> 01:11:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

999
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:49,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Having the flu and PMS at the same time.

1000
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:53,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks more than anything has sucked before.

1001
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:54,862
[SPEAKER_14]: La la la la la la la.

1002
01:11:55,182 --> 01:11:59,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is the DJ... I just had to say that.

1003
01:11:59,366 --> 01:11:59,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine tops.

1004
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:00,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.

1005
01:12:03,049 --> 01:12:03,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Women in DDR.

1006
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:07,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite me.

1007
01:12:07,433 --> 01:12:09,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Twin also says F you for not owning a PS2.

1008
01:12:09,815 --> 01:12:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: He just wants to clear that up.

1009
01:12:11,296 --> 01:12:12,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Then get one.

1010
01:12:13,157 --> 01:12:20,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Conundrum, a new person listening to the show, says, fuck you to the damn commies in the sky that watch me in DDR because DDR sucks.

1011
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:23,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1012
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:31,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to me for consistently changing names in the chat room because it was flipping back and forth between DarkSakura and Sky, so fuck that.

1013
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:33,287
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because I'm not at home.

1014
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:34,107
[SPEAKER_07]: When?

1015
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:38,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, our buddy, who's sometimes here during the live shows.

1016
01:12:38,649 --> 01:12:39,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder why she's not here tonight.

1017
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:40,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me cry.

1018
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:46,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to people who bring their babies to the 11pm showing of the movie The Ring last night.

1019
01:12:47,004 --> 01:12:51,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hurting your child's ears as well as pissing off everyone who wants to enjoy the movie.

1020
01:12:51,348 --> 01:12:51,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1021
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:54,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I have something along those lines too.

1022
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1023
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:55,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my music?

1024
01:12:57,933 --> 01:12:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your music.

1025
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Dan and I were at Fresh Choice today.

1026
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:05,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoying our lovely salads and soups.

1027
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:07,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I had really good acorn squash soup.

1028
01:13:07,263 --> 01:13:08,444
[SPEAKER_04]: French Choice is a rip-off.

1029
01:13:08,524 --> 01:13:09,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1030
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:10,847
[SPEAKER_04]: They charge something like nine bucks.

1031
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:12,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to get my fuck you, so fuck you.

1032
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:13,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me have my fuck you.

1033
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:16,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1034
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:20,059
[SPEAKER_04]: This woman was... Do you still have that PMS thing going on?

1035
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:20,700
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1036
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucking weird.

1037
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:26,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl, I'm going to drop the bomb on your ass.

1038
01:13:27,998 --> 01:13:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, um, this little kid makes a mess.

1039
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,120
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, little kids make messes.

1040
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:36,583
[SPEAKER_07]: This woman comes up, her mom comes up to her and goes, Oh my God, what are you doing?

1041
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:37,783
[SPEAKER_07]: In the middle of a damn restaurant?

1042
01:13:37,823 --> 01:13:38,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

1043
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:40,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan and I look over.

1044
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:43,200
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1045
01:13:57,035 --> 01:13:59,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is, is that you know who Dan and I are blaming for?

1046
01:13:59,577 --> 01:14:00,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not the little girl we're blaming.

1047
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:02,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Her mom for being such a bitch.

1048
01:14:02,678 --> 01:14:04,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So, fuck you, whoever you were, woman.

1049
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,261
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't even look like a bitch, too.

1050
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1051
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:07,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1052
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:09,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that weird when, like, people just look like a bitch?

1053
01:14:09,803 --> 01:14:10,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can just tell?

1054
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:11,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people should not breed.

1055
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:12,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1056
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

1057
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:18,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get back to the chatroom FUs now?

1058
01:14:18,148 --> 01:14:18,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, please.

1059
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:23,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another new person here, hello to you, it's EOSFVB.

1060
01:14:24,768 --> 01:14:27,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's some kind of acronym, I don't know though.

1061
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:31,933
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, fuck you to AMD for making a 2.7 gigahertz.

1062
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:40,479
[SPEAKER_04]: When I get it, it's going to have this huge heat sink and fan, which is going to make a lot of noise, making him crazy, and also will exhaust a lot of heat, which will fuck over the whole global warming thing.

1063
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:41,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't run the heater.

1064
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have a choice.

1065
01:14:54,973 --> 01:14:55,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone else gets cold.

1066
01:14:56,553 --> 01:14:57,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get cold.

1067
01:14:57,674 --> 01:14:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.

1068
01:14:57,874 --> 01:15:03,895
[SPEAKER_04]: On Halloween, Dan and I were taking his dad out to dinner for his birthday, so that was more important.

1069
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:23,042
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was watching Friends.

1070
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:24,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

1071
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we were at Red Lobster.

1072
01:15:27,744 --> 01:15:29,184
[SPEAKER_04]: IT vote Survivor, okay?

1073
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to watch Survivor until the next day.

1074
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pissed.

1075
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:35,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1076
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:38,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to Sukjai for voting out Sheehan.

1077
01:15:38,488 --> 01:15:39,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

1078
01:15:40,129 --> 01:15:40,829
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

1079
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:43,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means nothing to the rest of us.

1080
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:49,132
[SPEAKER_04]: JB says, um, F you to the little kid at RVGL who likes to grab asses.

1081
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:51,482
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1082
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:55,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1083
01:15:55,106 --> 01:15:56,187
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll just leave it at that.

1084
01:15:57,288 --> 01:15:59,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Mama, I think this is a good one to end on.

1085
01:15:59,611 --> 01:16:00,311
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last one.

1086
01:16:00,351 --> 01:16:02,974
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, my fuck you is to school because it sucks.

1087
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:05,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

1088
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:06,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't go.

1089
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:12,995
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know, I graduated high school several years ago.

1090
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you were that simple.

1091
01:16:14,517 --> 01:16:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too old.

1092
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:16,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too old for DDR.

1093
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,260
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that I have to go to work tomorrow.

1094
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've had a whole week off.

1095
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:21,302
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

1096
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, F you to work tomorrow.

1097
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had a week at all and I still don't want to go tomorrow.

1098
01:16:26,306 --> 01:16:27,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Friday off.

1099
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:27,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so nice.

1100
01:16:27,848 --> 01:16:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I could sleep until like 11.

1101
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:31,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to meet Loki at like 9 and whoops, I slept.

1102
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that we've gotten those 5Qs out of the way.

1103
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:38,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I need to check the mail.

1104
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:39,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we got any over email.

1105
01:16:40,202 --> 01:16:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give them the courtesy, because not everybody loves the chatroom.

1106
01:16:42,944 --> 01:16:43,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1107
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:47,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No 5Qs over mail, so... Fuck you to the listeners for not emailing us.

1108
01:16:47,826 --> 01:16:48,347
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

1109
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:48,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We love listeners.

1110
01:16:48,867 --> 01:16:49,567
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1111
01:16:50,828 --> 01:16:51,628
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1112
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:52,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1113
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:54,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1114
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:55,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you.

1115
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,331
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1116
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,251
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1117
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of anything that rhymed.

1118
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:03,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought up in one of the FUs, Survivor, a popular program on CBS.

1119
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:11,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of CBS, segue, segue, we have the early show finally happening tomorrow from what we're being told.

1120
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:14,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been delayed not once, but twice now.

1121
01:17:14,408 --> 01:17:23,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to happen on Halloween and I had the whole TiVo set up to tape it and lo and behold, it didn't even happen because I guess it rained or something so they couldn't do it.

1122
01:17:23,992 --> 01:17:27,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The early show is like CBS's answer to Today, you know the Today show?

1123
01:17:27,674 --> 01:17:28,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a

1124
01:17:28,414 --> 01:17:29,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like a brand new show?

1125
01:17:29,735 --> 01:17:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know Good Morning America?

1126
01:17:31,497 --> 01:17:33,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's like, you know, the early new show.

1127
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:37,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, yes, you're right, Loki, they just re-tailored the show recently.

1128
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:42,606
[SPEAKER_04]: They got rid of Brian, well, Brian Gumbel quit, I think, and the other chick got let go, and they have like a panel.

1129
01:17:44,287 --> 01:17:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell, but they're turning it into The View.

1130
01:17:46,048 --> 01:17:48,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically, now it's the early show, but it's The View.

1131
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:49,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But with men.

1132
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:55,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, for our listeners who are unfamiliar with my habits of watching TV, I don't.

1133
01:17:56,312 --> 01:17:57,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just thought I'd clarify that for you.

1134
01:17:58,493 --> 01:18:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So if somebody brings up a show to me, I'm usually going to go, what's that?

1135
01:18:03,695 --> 01:18:06,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a commercial, I'm going to go, what's that?

1136
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:08,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I keep up with is Buffy.

1137
01:18:10,037 --> 01:18:12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't watched Buffy since the season started.

1138
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:16,365
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have to watch Buffy because I need to see James Marsters naked, okay?

1139
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:17,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1140
01:18:17,547 --> 01:18:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I need Spike.

1141
01:18:18,476 --> 01:18:20,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, CBS, early show.

1142
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:24,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been delayed, but I guess it's finally going to happen Monday.

1143
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys are up early tomorrow, you should watch this, provided it doesn't get delayed again.

1144
01:18:29,243 --> 01:18:32,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps I should check some of the big news sites and make sure it didn't get delayed again.

1145
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:37,568
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess there's going to be some folks just out there playing DDR.

1146
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:38,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what they're going to do.

1147
01:18:38,488 --> 01:18:40,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what arcade machine they're going to be playing or anything.

1148
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:41,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee!

1149
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:42,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best dance!

1150
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:04,506
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1151
01:19:20,845 --> 01:19:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have the early show tomorrow.

1152
01:19:22,946 --> 01:19:23,666
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1153
01:19:23,726 --> 01:19:31,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you it's going to be like, it's going to be one of those things they show in like cutting the commercials and then maybe they'll just kind of briefly mention it for two minutes.

1154
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:37,551
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably interview DJ 8-Ball or something and then, you know, we'll get to hear about it for weeks and weeks.

1155
01:19:39,892 --> 01:19:44,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, did you see that DDR was on CBS?

1156
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1157
01:19:45,353 --> 01:19:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, it was to DDR.

1158
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, oh my god, they played Oops I Did It Again on MTV.

1159
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomani on TV, wow.

1160
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what MTV needs to play?

1161
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:00,631
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hot Limit video.

1162
01:20:01,512 --> 01:20:03,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that video is so much ass.

1163
01:20:05,173 --> 01:20:10,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, you know what, we need to set aside a little bit of space and put the Hot Limit video up on the site.

1164
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at some point we're going to need to, because that video is like the fruitiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

1165
01:20:14,717 --> 01:20:15,878
That's fine, that's fine.

1166
01:20:17,065 --> 01:20:17,705
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1167
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I got one more FU coming, and it's for somebody that I like, Vandalus.

1168
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:51,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll have to PM that to me, so send that over, and I'll get that FU in there before we go to another segment.

1169
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving along, would you like to do a sim update, Loki?

1170
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,053
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1171
01:21:17,418 --> 01:21:18,099
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1172
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:48,001
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, keep your eyes on your TV people who are inclined to do so.

1173
01:21:48,943 --> 01:21:59,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, for anybody who actually posts on the Sackman Money Board, if you go to the Leading Cyber Forum, there is a link to this commercial so you can download it for yourself and watch it.

1174
01:21:59,495 --> 01:22:01,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely hilarious.

1175
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:05,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as cool though as the Gacked one, I'm sorry.

1176
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:09,050
[SPEAKER_04]: For one of the other Metal Gear games.

1177
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if it was Metal Gear Solid.

1178
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,211
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just going, I don't know.

1179
01:22:12,731 --> 01:22:13,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1180
01:22:14,151 --> 01:22:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gacked commercial was so funny.

1181
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:18,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make that available somehow.

1182
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:19,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make that available.

1183
01:22:19,592 --> 01:22:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Gacked is the hottest woman.

1184
01:22:22,753 --> 01:22:29,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to say while we're on the topic of commercials, the one with Donald Trump and Grimace for McDonald's.

1185
01:22:29,495 --> 01:22:30,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm clueless.

1186
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:32,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm clueless too.

1187
01:22:32,084 --> 01:22:33,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch enough TV.

1188
01:22:33,465 --> 01:22:35,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since I got TiVo, I fast forward through commercials.

1189
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know... I'm a whore for TiVo.

1190
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:38,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit is awesome.

1191
01:22:38,986 --> 01:22:42,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know... I have this theory, and I posted this on DDR Freak a while back.

1192
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:46,828
[SPEAKER_07]: That the McDonaldland characters represent different factions of the franchise.

1193
01:22:48,228 --> 01:22:50,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Ronald represents the company itself.

1194
01:22:51,329 --> 01:22:52,809
[SPEAKER_07]: The all-encompassing whole.

1195
01:22:54,049 --> 01:22:56,870
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the early bird, who represents breakfast.

1196
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,411
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the fry guys, who represent the fries.

1197
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:09,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Mayor McCheese, who's the cheeseburger, and Big Mac, the cop, and the Hamburglar.

1198
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:15,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronald isn't the crazy psycho who likes to lure children into his playlands.

1199
01:23:16,122 --> 01:23:17,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1200
01:23:18,103 --> 01:23:25,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan and I have been trying to think of what the Grimace represented, and we finally realized it.

1201
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:28,312
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what McDonald's wants its consumers to be.

1202
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:31,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Big, purple blobby things.

1203
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like trying to compare the Wizard of Oz to the Dust Bowl, that whole thing in history class?

1204
01:23:35,661 --> 01:23:36,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where you're going with this?

1205
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:38,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, kind of, but no.

1206
01:23:38,982 --> 01:23:43,983
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is, you know, the McDonald's franchise wants us all to be dim-witted, slow, and fat.

1207
01:23:44,303 --> 01:23:45,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And live off of their food.

1208
01:23:46,143 --> 01:23:48,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Where, you know what my impression of the Grimace is?

1209
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,105
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the expression you make after eating there.

1210
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but like, it's Donald Trump and Grimace.

1211
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:55,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't get a better couple.

1212
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:57,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's too cool.

1213
01:23:57,948 --> 01:23:58,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Donald Trump.

1214
01:23:58,388 --> 01:23:59,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Ivana and Grimace.

1215
01:23:59,269 --> 01:23:59,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And Grimace.

1216
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Grimace is what you get after eating a Taco Bell.

1217
01:24:02,832 --> 01:24:03,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm making a gift!

1218
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:05,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

1219
01:24:06,756 --> 01:24:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I got Vandalus' FU, and since we like Vandalus, we'll let him in a little late, because we didn't get it before.

1220
01:24:12,421 --> 01:24:17,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Vandalus says FU to politicians for filling his mailbox the past week with snail mail spam.

1221
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:17,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Vandalus!

1222
01:24:21,074 --> 01:24:25,159
[SPEAKER_02]: and for all those stupid fucking poster things that are out there.

1223
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, there's like so many of them.

1224
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:30,986
[SPEAKER_04]: God, it's like being in high school and seeing all the posters around campus, you know.

1225
01:24:31,006 --> 01:24:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hello people.

1226
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote Jamie for class president.

1227
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,431
[SPEAKER_02]: She rocks.

1228
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the number of posters that wins you the votes.

1229
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:40,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a clue.

1230
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:44,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your vote going to be based on something different there, Dave?

1231
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:52,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going to go around and tabulate how many posters are up, and then I'll vote for the person who spent the most time putting them all up.

1232
01:24:53,514 --> 01:24:55,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God you're not 18 and can't vote.

1233
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:56,575
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1234
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:58,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember how that was in high school.

1235
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And one year, I put up a poster that says, vote for me because I wasn't nominated.

1236
01:25:05,587 --> 01:25:12,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a late response to your commercial about the Metal Gear Solid commercial from 23rd Magazine.

1237
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,402
[SPEAKER_04]: The truck has started to move!

1238
01:25:15,224 --> 01:25:15,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

1239
01:25:15,905 --> 01:25:17,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I love that!

1240
01:25:18,636 --> 01:25:20,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, the Treadcafts started to move.

1241
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,199
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to take a really quick break.

1242
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:27,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come back and we're going to do a listless segment.

1243
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:29,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's favorite.

1244
01:25:29,622 --> 01:25:33,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can participate through email as well, but we like it if you're in the chat room.

1245
01:25:33,464 --> 01:25:37,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and join the chat room, any other side IRC server.

1246
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: You can join irc.egheads.org as your server.

1247
01:25:40,627 --> 01:25:43,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can join karma.othersideirc.net.

1248
01:25:43,449 --> 01:25:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge is what you're going to join.

1249
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:53,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And tonight, the list list is going to be a little bit different.

1250
01:25:54,836 --> 01:25:58,118
[SPEAKER_04]: We decided we're selling out this week since Max USA just came out.

1251
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to pretty much suck Konami's dick tonight.

1252
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're going to do... The views expressed by Rob are not necessarily those views expressed by the cast members.

1253
01:26:10,107 --> 01:26:16,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much tonight what we're doing, we're doing best Konami game, not the money.

1254
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:20,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So best Konami game that wasn't Bomani.

1255
01:26:20,493 --> 01:26:21,053
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going old school.

1256
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we're possibly going new school.

1257
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:23,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be arcade games.

1258
01:26:24,553 --> 01:26:26,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be damn near anything.

1259
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:27,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1260
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:29,034
[SPEAKER_07]: We're being specific with this.

1261
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:30,994
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

1262
01:26:31,014 --> 01:26:31,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start this off.

1263
01:26:32,015 --> 01:26:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have an old school Beatmania song and a really old school DDR song in this mix.

1264
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:40,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start it off with one more new school Max USA track.

1265
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:45,177
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Do It Right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1266
01:29:52,848 --> 01:30:03,632
DMT is a tab, don't think what I suck, and T to bring something, don't sleep on the end, you see something like brother, it don't take time for me to blow your mind, it take a second to record because you dumb and block, so just laugh, but you're an empty cloud under the sun.

1267
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:28,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1268
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:04,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to move it, move it.

1269
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:06,770
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to move it.

1270
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to move it, move it.

1271
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:10,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to move it, move it.

1272
01:31:10,991 --> 01:31:12,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to move it, move it.

1273
01:31:12,852 --> 01:31:14,832
You like to move it.

1274
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:16,533
I like to move it, move it.

1275
01:31:16,673 --> 01:31:18,674
I like to move it, move it.

1276
01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:20,374
I like to move it, move it.

1277
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:22,335
You like to move it.

1278
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:24,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been all over the world.

1279
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:35,375
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you move your body, wanna move it nicer

1280
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:50,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, letter A, and the number B9.

1281
01:32:50,142 --> 01:32:55,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1282
01:32:56,267 --> 01:32:58,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1283
01:32:58,809 --> 01:32:59,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi-ho.

1284
01:32:59,129 --> 01:32:59,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut it, dude.

1285
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:04,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And as promised, here we go with...

1286
01:33:04,761 --> 01:33:07,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's list list segment, yay!

1287
01:33:08,964 --> 01:33:14,428
[SPEAKER_07]: This particular list list is non-Beinami Konami games.

1288
01:33:14,728 --> 01:33:15,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1289
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:22,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it be stuff that's been in the arcade, whether it's been in America, whether it was only released in Japan, whether it's super obscure, we're talking about them.

1290
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, I love you!

1291
01:33:26,782 --> 01:33:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Freakin' press your luck.

1292
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: No whammy, no whammy!

1293
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:30,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop!

1294
01:33:31,225 --> 01:33:31,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1295
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:32,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry.

1296
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:35,388
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so old school, this is cool.

1297
01:33:35,408 --> 01:33:37,350
[SPEAKER_04]: They're teasing you in the chatroom for saying Ben-Mommy.

1298
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I said Ben-Mommy.

1299
01:33:40,452 --> 01:33:42,394
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you flubbed it up, that's okay.

1300
01:33:42,914 --> 01:33:46,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my analysis is full of snot.

1301
01:33:47,418 --> 01:33:50,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You try talking with a stuffed up head like mine...

1302
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll see, okay?

1303
01:33:53,665 --> 01:33:53,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitches.

1304
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:54,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1305
01:33:54,627 --> 01:33:55,288
[SPEAKER_07]: But I love you anyway.

1306
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So, best, and this can be as old school or as new school as you want.

1307
01:33:59,457 --> 01:34:02,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, your number three choice for best Konami, not a Bomani game.

1308
01:34:03,044 --> 01:34:06,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my number three choice is an arcade game, Police 9-1-1-2.

1309
01:34:06,126 --> 01:34:13,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that game is cool, and it kind of defeats the purpose of having the game be called 9-1-1-2.

1310
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,291
[SPEAKER_09]: The Police!

1311
01:34:15,352 --> 01:34:19,314
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, the Japanese name was Keisatsu-kan, so... It makes sense.

1312
01:34:19,374 --> 01:34:19,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

1313
01:34:26,098 --> 01:34:26,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1314
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number three choice for Konami thing?

1315
01:34:31,043 --> 01:34:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1316
01:34:31,564 --> 01:34:34,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally old school arcade game here.

1317
01:34:34,487 --> 01:34:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Ninja Turtles arcade game.

1318
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Turtles.

1319
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1320
01:34:41,835 --> 01:34:42,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1321
01:34:43,757 --> 01:34:46,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to plug so many quarters in that machine.

1322
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even fun.

1323
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:50,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember one night being at the arcade.

1324
01:34:50,792 --> 01:34:54,115
[SPEAKER_07]: This was, by the way, the same day my brother got hit by a car and was in the hospital.

1325
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,977
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, these guys paid me to play as Leonardo.

1326
01:34:57,418 --> 01:34:58,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got to the end of the game.

1327
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:02,342
[SPEAKER_07]: We had freaking... What was the name?

1328
01:35:02,382 --> 01:35:02,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Crane?

1329
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:11,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we had Shredder beaten and the other guy, and then they turned off the machines at Lab's Castle because they were kicking us out.

1330
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:12,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitches.

1331
01:35:12,569 --> 01:35:17,953
[SPEAKER_09]: The only multiplayer game that I liked more than the Ninja Turtles was the X-Men six-player game that came out.

1332
01:35:18,453 --> 01:35:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that was Konami, though.

1333
01:35:20,074 --> 01:35:21,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was Konami.

1334
01:35:21,835 --> 01:35:24,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, my number three... Jamie's number three.

1335
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:26,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, I picked games that I own because I'm cool.

1336
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:32,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said Gradius II, because everybody knows how much I love Gradius II.

1337
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:33,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning Heat?

1338
01:35:33,345 --> 01:35:33,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1339
01:35:33,866 --> 01:35:38,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, instead what I picked for my number three was Kid Dracula on Game Boy.

1340
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:41,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you play as Super TV Alucard.

1341
01:35:41,994 --> 01:35:43,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, that's old school.

1342
01:35:44,176 --> 01:35:54,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I, and you know, the thing is, is like, if you look on the old Funkoland lists, you know, when they used to have the prices on those pages like that, the game is a $30 game, even used.

1343
01:35:55,327 --> 01:35:58,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's really hard to find.

1344
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:05,237
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone can find the game, you can get ROMs, though, for the Famicom, the Famicom ROM, online.

1345
01:36:06,258 --> 01:36:07,499
[SPEAKER_07]: If no one's ever played it, check it out.

1346
01:36:07,799 --> 01:36:08,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

1347
01:36:10,203 --> 01:36:13,567
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick is Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

1348
01:36:13,707 --> 01:36:17,090
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was the shit.

1349
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you if you don't like that game.

1350
01:36:21,014 --> 01:36:22,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Two was the bomb.

1351
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:27,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they completely fucked up the first one in the best ways possible.

1352
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And the music owned and everything.

1353
01:36:29,202 --> 01:36:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Castlevania II it is.

1354
01:36:31,764 --> 01:36:33,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, your number two pick.

1355
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:37,380
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two pick is Gradius, the original.

1356
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:39,061
[SPEAKER_09]: This is cool.

1357
01:36:39,381 --> 01:36:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: From newest of school to oldest of school, Gradius for what, Nintendo Arcade?

1358
01:36:44,585 --> 01:36:45,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter, I'm not putting systems down.

1359
01:36:46,026 --> 01:36:46,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade.

1360
01:36:46,526 --> 01:36:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1361
01:36:50,328 --> 01:36:50,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Arcade.

1362
01:36:51,624 --> 01:36:56,327
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why I'm specifying systems on mine is because a couple of games on here did have variations from system to system.

1363
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:58,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, we'll be okay, I guess.

1364
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:00,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess arcade is... I don't know.

1365
01:37:00,469 --> 01:37:00,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1366
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is there any particular reason, Gradius?

1367
01:37:04,711 --> 01:37:05,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool.

1368
01:37:05,512 --> 01:37:06,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, cool.

1369
01:37:09,154 --> 01:37:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, number two?

1370
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:16,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, number two... I'm gonna have to go with Dracula X.

1371
01:37:19,092 --> 01:37:24,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, Dracula X, which one, the one that they put on what, TurboGrafx, or which one?

1372
01:37:26,281 --> 01:37:29,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one, the number, Castlevania 5, or what?

1373
01:37:29,645 --> 01:37:31,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's on PlayStation, I know that.

1374
01:37:31,828 --> 01:37:33,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, okay, that'll work.

1375
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Dracula X, okay.

1376
01:37:36,394 --> 01:37:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Dracula X...

1377
01:37:39,258 --> 01:37:40,358
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was my number one.

1378
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:41,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's okay.

1379
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:43,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a duplicate, so what?

1380
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, Loki's going to change it?

1381
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:46,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1382
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:46,961
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that then?

1383
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:49,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just go with Metal Gear Solid.

1384
01:37:49,522 --> 01:37:50,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid, okay.

1385
01:37:54,184 --> 01:37:56,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Switching gears and putting Metal Gear Solid.

1386
01:37:58,526 --> 01:37:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you're number two big.

1387
01:37:59,766 --> 01:38:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, Sexy Parodius for Saturn.

1388
01:38:02,648 --> 01:38:03,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1389
01:38:04,788 --> 01:38:05,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexy Parodius.

1390
01:38:06,508 --> 01:38:17,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I came close to saying Olshaberry Parodius, but Sexy Parodius just kicks its ass because you can play as Winby and Twinby and the guys on the paper airplane and the little bunny girls riding the rockets.

1391
01:38:18,838 --> 01:38:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is so cool.

1392
01:38:20,419 --> 01:38:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And what other game can you totally destroy a Las Vegas showgirl in?

1393
01:38:25,584 --> 01:38:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And a pirate ship with a kitty cat face on it.

1394
01:38:29,753 --> 01:38:32,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I see in the chat room, I see Guardian Legend being mentioned.

1395
01:38:32,434 --> 01:38:33,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We should point out that's not Konami.

1396
01:38:33,514 --> 01:38:34,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Guardian Legend was made by Irem.

1397
01:38:34,595 --> 01:38:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: That's made by Irem.

1398
01:38:36,075 --> 01:38:36,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Broderbund.

1399
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Released by Broderbund.

1400
01:38:38,336 --> 01:38:39,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Who were the same people that made Lode Runner.

1401
01:38:39,776 --> 01:38:41,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you remember Lode Runner, you're cool.

1402
01:38:42,137 --> 01:38:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two pick is Life Force.

1403
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:47,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Life Force is awesome.

1404
01:38:48,086 --> 01:38:48,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Salamander series.

1405
01:38:48,947 --> 01:38:50,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The honky version of Gradius II.

1406
01:38:51,189 --> 01:38:52,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't really Gradius II, it was Salamander.

1407
01:38:52,911 --> 01:38:53,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Force was Salamander.

1408
01:38:53,492 --> 01:38:53,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1409
01:38:53,992 --> 01:38:56,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But they called it Gradius II here, in America at least, didn't they?

1410
01:38:56,715 --> 01:38:57,916
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was Life Force.

1411
01:38:58,217 --> 01:39:01,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember they kind of... The reason why I know this is because I found my Nintendo cartridge of it last night.

1412
01:39:01,881 --> 01:39:02,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay.

1413
01:39:02,822 --> 01:39:03,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1414
01:39:04,528 --> 01:39:08,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, for my number one pick, I had Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1415
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:09,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, good pick.

1416
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:14,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would have been on my list if I didn't already know you were picking that.

1417
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:17,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I had trouble coming up with some Konami games.

1418
01:39:17,912 --> 01:39:27,595
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just really love that game and the music owned, and the fact that you can play as Alucard and I think Richter and the girl, I forget.

1419
01:39:27,996 --> 01:39:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only play as Maria on the Saturn version, and the Saturn version had two extra levels.

1420
01:39:33,513 --> 01:39:36,515
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play as Maria after you... Well, that was a rumor, I think.

1421
01:39:36,555 --> 01:39:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it ever really was possible.

1422
01:39:38,396 --> 01:39:42,879
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing about it is that Maria was supposed to be playable on the original, plus they had the other two levels done.

1423
01:39:43,339 --> 01:39:46,661
[SPEAKER_07]: If you notice, there's a little trick you can do when you first run into the corridor.

1424
01:39:47,381 --> 01:40:00,629
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go back to that first corridor and stomp on this trapdoor, you can go down the trapdoor to a save room, but that save room leads to the underground garden on the Saturn version.

1425
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a little bit of trivia.

1426
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:03,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1427
01:40:04,052 --> 01:40:04,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1428
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:06,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Strider is Capcom, we should point out.

1429
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:14,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger is a Konami game, but I think... I think somebody else put it out and then Konami distributed it.

1430
01:40:14,683 --> 01:40:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1431
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:16,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Atari?

1432
01:40:16,484 --> 01:40:16,785
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure?

1433
01:40:18,246 --> 01:40:21,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's one that Konami distributed a version of it.

1434
01:40:22,448 --> 01:40:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they were just the distributors of it or something.

1435
01:40:24,169 --> 01:40:24,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1436
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:25,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, who cares?

1437
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:27,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't showed up on the list yet.

1438
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:28,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you're number one.

1439
01:40:29,432 --> 01:40:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're number one.

1440
01:40:32,933 --> 01:40:35,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm torn, but I'm going to have to go with Contra.

1441
01:40:36,915 --> 01:40:42,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go with Contra Shattered Soldier because that's the brand new one and it's everything Contra should be.

1442
01:40:43,299 --> 01:40:44,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Except very, very, very, very hard.

1443
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,821
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess Contra's supposed to be very, very, very, very, very hard.

1444
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one is Dracula X, Rondo of Blood for the PC Engine Duo

1445
01:41:02,717 --> 01:41:04,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Game was not released in America.

1446
01:41:04,098 --> 01:41:09,119
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, for all of you who own the Super Nintendo version, I feel so sorry for you because it's totally butchered.

1447
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:14,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Dracula X Rondo of Blood has the best music ever.

1448
01:41:14,641 --> 01:41:15,942
[SPEAKER_07]: The best levels ever.

1449
01:41:16,042 --> 01:41:21,164
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like... And I actually... My friend had to pay Dan and I back for...

1450
01:41:21,984 --> 01:41:23,325
[SPEAKER_07]: DRACULAX

1451
01:41:45,323 --> 01:41:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Very popular series in Japan, but they didn't do much with it here.

1452
01:41:48,764 --> 01:41:55,606
[SPEAKER_04]: They released a couple games, I think, but I swear this is... I'm naming the American version of this because this is the one I remember playing as a kid.

1453
01:41:55,886 --> 01:41:57,147
[SPEAKER_04]: This version was the shit.

1454
01:41:57,407 --> 01:41:58,387
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is the shit.

1455
01:41:58,887 --> 01:41:59,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

1456
01:41:59,828 --> 01:42:02,769
[SPEAKER_04]: It had Gradius in it, you might remember, in one little part.

1457
01:42:03,129 --> 01:42:04,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It is The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

1458
01:42:11,473 --> 01:42:14,615
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was like the best Super Nintendo game they did.

1459
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:16,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe next to like Actraiser, I don't know.

1460
01:42:16,436 --> 01:42:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have to offer an honorable mention to a series.

1461
01:42:19,939 --> 01:42:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: The Konami World series.

1462
01:42:21,721 --> 01:42:22,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami World.

1463
01:42:23,081 --> 01:42:28,262
[SPEAKER_07]: They were released in Japan on the Famicom.

1464
01:42:28,562 --> 01:42:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They were basically, you play as two generic characters who could go to different Konami games.

1465
01:42:34,403 --> 01:42:35,763
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a Castlevania world.

1466
01:42:36,364 --> 01:42:37,944
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a Gradius world.

1467
01:42:38,004 --> 01:42:39,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Kingdom Hearts Konami.

1468
01:42:40,084 --> 01:42:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was kind of like that, but it's pretty funny.

1469
01:42:44,485 --> 01:42:49,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, that's also one that you probably will have to find in a ROM now because it's...

1470
01:42:50,146 --> 01:42:50,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami!

1471
01:42:50,427 --> 01:42:50,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami!

1472
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:50,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami!

1473
01:43:11,106 --> 01:43:29,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Police 911 Part 2, Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, Kid Dracula, Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest, Gradius Arcade, Metal Gear Solid, Sexy Proteus, Life Force Slash Salamander, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Contra's Shattered Soldier, Dracula X, The PC Engine Version, and The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

1474
01:43:30,105 --> 01:43:30,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, this is hard.

1475
01:43:31,106 --> 01:43:33,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but you get to start it off, Dave.

1476
01:43:33,668 --> 01:43:34,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one's coming off the list?

1477
01:43:36,129 --> 01:43:36,449
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a bitch.

1478
01:43:36,489 --> 01:43:39,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I still live for Castlevania 3, or Super Castlevania 4.

1479
01:43:40,452 --> 01:43:40,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki...

1480
01:44:06,401 --> 01:44:22,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never really a fan of a game where the bullets travel like 20 miles an hour, so I'm going to have to take off Police 911 too, because bullets are supposed to travel at bullet speed and not at fly, slow paper airplane speed.

1481
01:44:22,813 --> 01:44:24,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I was going to eliminate, Daniel.

1482
01:44:24,714 --> 01:44:32,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you not mention, did you forget to remember that you're Superman, you're faster than a speeding bullet, so everything moves like slow motion.

1483
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:45,016
[SPEAKER_07]: bullet time alright, Jamie, your turn god life force is so freaking hard you know, I'm thinking about see, I have memories attached to all of these games that's the sad thing

1484
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:52,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to leave Lifeforce on there, just because even though that game is harder than hell, it's awesome.

1485
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:55,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Symphony of the Night is awesome, even though the Saturn version is great.

1486
01:44:57,331 --> 01:45:00,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra has the turtle with the fetus ass.

1487
01:45:02,157 --> 01:45:06,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I never really played the Goemon game, so I had to give it a boot.

1488
01:45:07,179 --> 01:45:08,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a bitch.

1489
01:45:08,982 --> 01:45:09,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1490
01:45:09,963 --> 01:45:13,087
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I really... I'm just being picked on tonight.

1491
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've always wanted to, but because I have no experience attached to that game, I'm taking it out.

1492
01:45:20,056 --> 01:45:20,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well...

1493
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because I can get a little revenge, because this one was my next pick to go off the list.

1494
01:45:26,803 --> 01:45:30,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So my apologies to Jamie, but Kid Dracula, come on.

1495
01:45:30,746 --> 01:45:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Boy, I just don't have much sentiment attached to that game, and as Dave mentioned earlier, if you're going to have a Castlevania game on the list, it needs to be Symphony of the Night.

1496
01:45:38,812 --> 01:45:41,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Dracula X is a good choice, too, but not Kid Dracula.

1497
01:45:41,454 --> 01:45:44,296
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chibi-Alo card with the spiky dragon ball hair.

1498
01:45:44,496 --> 01:45:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it once, and didn't need to play it again.

1499
01:45:47,358 --> 01:45:48,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, Jamie.

1500
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you hit them, they go, poof!

1501
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:53,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I was considering Contra Shattered Soldier, but I don't know.

1502
01:45:54,043 --> 01:45:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is so disgustingly beautiful.

1503
01:45:57,046 --> 01:45:57,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1504
01:45:59,207 --> 01:45:59,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Turtles.

1505
01:46:00,088 --> 01:46:01,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's the final list you guys have to vote on.

1506
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send me your votes over a private message in the channel during the next song.

1507
01:46:06,934 --> 01:46:08,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Random note right there for you, Jamie.

1508
01:46:08,755 --> 01:46:09,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1509
01:46:10,076 --> 01:46:10,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.

1510
01:46:10,676 --> 01:46:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1511
01:46:11,557 --> 01:46:13,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm closing out all my windows so you guys can send me your votes.

1512
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:19,199
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I post the list in the chat room, you guys can send me your votes over private message.

1513
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:20,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them over to Sky in the chat room.

1514
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can send them over email.

1515
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to do it right now.

1516
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:27,502
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com Jamie's going to read for you all the final list here.

1517
01:46:27,782 --> 01:46:28,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it's posted.

1518
01:46:29,103 --> 01:46:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, go for it.

1519
01:46:30,503 --> 01:46:31,544
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as you put those back up.

1520
01:46:31,704 --> 01:46:32,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

1521
01:46:32,184 --> 01:46:32,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1522
01:46:33,803 --> 01:46:48,334
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, we have Gradius Arcade, we have Metal Gear Solid, we have Sexy Proteus, we have Life Force Salamander, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Contra Shattered Soldier, and Dracula X PC Engine Duo version.

1523
01:46:50,126 --> 01:46:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're going to play a quick song for you guys, and then we'll come back and... What, we're going to do Burning Heat?

1524
01:46:58,489 --> 01:47:01,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's kind of a cute one.

1525
01:47:02,631 --> 01:47:03,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pull it up.

1526
01:47:03,211 --> 01:47:04,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and do the one from 2DX.

1527
01:47:04,672 --> 01:47:05,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't usually play this one.

1528
01:47:05,732 --> 01:47:07,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually play the one from DDR.

1529
01:47:07,073 --> 01:47:10,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do the one from 2DX, and we'll be right back.

1530
01:47:10,594 --> 01:47:12,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys have about two minutes to vote.

1531
01:47:12,575 --> 01:47:14,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do two songs, and then we'll come back.

1532
01:47:15,356 --> 01:47:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: See ya!

1533
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:30,430
Thanks for watching!

1534
01:52:35,031 --> 01:52:37,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or we will kill you.

1535
01:52:44,918 --> 01:52:45,539
[SPEAKER_07]: and your firstborn.

1536
01:52:46,199 --> 01:52:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1537
01:52:48,781 --> 01:52:49,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1538
01:52:49,281 --> 01:52:51,383
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the final list all prepared for you guys.

1539
01:52:52,684 --> 01:52:59,890
[SPEAKER_04]: The winners are, for the best non-Bamani, best burp goes to Sky.

1540
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:00,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1541
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:02,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Jamie had the best burp two weeks ago.

1542
01:53:03,412 --> 01:53:03,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1543
01:53:04,033 --> 01:53:05,013
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was really weak.

1544
01:53:06,033 --> 01:53:07,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're fighting over this question.

1545
01:53:07,594 --> 01:53:09,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get to the list, we'll answer this question.

1546
01:53:09,735 --> 01:53:12,297
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fighting over how many options you can have in Gradius.

1547
01:53:12,317 --> 01:53:12,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Four.

1548
01:53:13,718 --> 01:53:14,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You're pretty convinced it's four?

1549
01:53:15,019 --> 01:53:16,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have four options in Gradius.

1550
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,602
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Nintendo versions, you think there might have been only two?

1551
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:23,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the Nintendo version you can only have two, and I think in Life Force you can only have two.

1552
01:53:23,684 --> 01:53:30,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But in Gradius, you could have four options, because I know that there are some bosses that you cannot beat unless you do the straight line.

1553
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:33,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I seem to... You are up, and you have your options trailing behind you.

1554
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:34,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think...

1555
01:53:34,671 --> 01:53:35,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Force was two.

1556
01:53:35,432 --> 01:53:35,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Force was two.

1557
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:36,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gradius.

1558
01:53:36,213 --> 01:53:37,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a fact that Gradius was four.

1559
01:53:37,254 --> 01:53:38,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Force is a fucking car.

1560
01:53:56,152 --> 01:53:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1561
01:54:13,366 --> 01:54:14,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to my house and plug them in.

1562
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:15,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Eurobeat No. 1!

1563
01:54:28,645 --> 01:54:30,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, here we have our winners.

1564
01:54:30,366 --> 01:54:31,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have our winners.

1565
01:54:31,246 --> 01:54:34,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny, in third place, what is our third place winner?

1566
01:54:34,847 --> 01:54:35,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Sexy Parodius.

1567
01:54:36,127 --> 01:54:36,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1568
01:54:37,167 --> 01:54:39,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is so freaking cool.

1569
01:54:40,048 --> 01:54:44,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for the reasons I mentioned before, just because I like blowing up a Las Vegas showgirl and killing her to death.

1570
01:54:45,049 --> 01:54:45,409
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1571
01:54:45,509 --> 01:54:46,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing her to death.

1572
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:47,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, there's redundancy for you.

1573
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1574
01:54:52,092 --> 01:54:59,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, for those of us who imported it, it would be Dracula X2 Nocturne in the Moonlight.

1575
01:55:00,797 --> 01:55:02,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It was officially in the Dracula X series.

1576
01:55:02,218 --> 01:55:03,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a travesty.

1577
01:55:03,799 --> 01:55:04,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It should have been number one.

1578
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,021
[SPEAKER_04]: You people have no taste, but that's fine.

1579
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:08,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one.

1580
01:55:08,982 --> 01:55:09,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Drumroll, please.

1581
01:55:11,423 --> 01:55:12,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninja Turtles arcade game.

1582
01:55:14,305 --> 01:55:15,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I have such fond memories of that.

1583
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:18,040
[SPEAKER_04]: By somewhat of a landslide, might I add.

1584
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,629
[SPEAKER_07]: My God, it got like, what, 65 votes, something like that?

1585
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

1586
01:55:21,869 --> 01:55:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot for Turtles, the arcade game.

1587
01:55:24,059 --> 01:55:26,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is okay.

1588
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an okay first choice, I guess.

1589
01:55:29,482 --> 01:55:31,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But Symphony of the Night still should have been your number one.

1590
01:55:31,863 --> 01:55:34,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that, I reprimand all of you in the chatroom.

1591
01:55:34,584 --> 01:55:42,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so addicted to Symphony of the Night when it came out, but when the Saturn version came out, I blew through the whole game with Maria.

1592
01:55:43,269 --> 01:55:45,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, she kicks Alucard's ass.

1593
01:55:46,591 --> 01:55:48,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria is so powerful in that game.

1594
01:55:49,432 --> 01:55:51,313
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very few places that she can't get to.

1595
01:55:53,522 --> 01:56:00,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um... There's also, though, I mean... What?

1596
01:56:01,405 --> 01:56:02,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just laughing at chat things.

1597
01:56:02,546 --> 01:56:02,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1598
01:56:03,126 --> 01:56:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, you saw something I pulled in the chat.

1599
01:56:04,687 --> 01:56:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1600
01:56:05,227 --> 01:56:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let Jamie finish her thought, and then we'll go on to the other tangent.

1601
01:56:08,288 --> 01:56:10,329
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought just got deflated, so you go ahead.

1602
01:56:10,809 --> 01:56:11,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on your tangent.

1603
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:12,530
[SPEAKER_07]: See if I care.

1604
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:14,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my propel to keep me happy.

1605
01:56:16,072 --> 01:56:16,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1606
01:56:17,532 --> 01:56:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1607
01:56:18,893 --> 01:56:20,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me while I eat on air.

1608
01:56:20,474 --> 01:56:21,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Nom, nom.

1609
01:56:23,015 --> 01:56:23,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Only on the internet.

1610
01:56:37,594 --> 01:56:42,218
[SPEAKER_07]: What other game could you get Castlevania with Metroid-style gameplay?

1611
01:56:42,618 --> 01:56:42,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1612
01:56:43,559 --> 01:56:50,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you can't forget the cliche Ninja Turtles thing, which had, well, two things, really.

1613
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:59,291
[SPEAKER_02]: For the pseudo-3D, it had the diagonal walking down part, you know, where you had, like, sort of, you're going towards the camera, but not really.

1614
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you also had the jet hover skateboard things, for no apparent reason.

1615
01:57:04,335 --> 01:57:04,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

1616
01:57:06,329 --> 01:57:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so whatever.

1617
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,110
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be the Turtles people versus the Castlevania people.

1618
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:13,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Turtles in Time was cool, and fuck RVGL for getting rid of it.

1619
01:57:13,512 --> 01:57:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

1620
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them.

1621
01:57:14,832 --> 01:57:17,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually before... They need a Castlevania arcade game.

1622
01:57:17,313 --> 01:57:19,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It was close between Ninja Turtles and the Simpsons arcade game.

1623
01:57:20,594 --> 01:57:28,817
[SPEAKER_04]: The Simpsons arcade game was one I'm surprised didn't make the list, but it's the same engine as Turtles, so it's pretty much... I think a lot of people maybe are thinking Simpsons when they vote for TMNT.

1624
01:57:28,837 --> 01:57:29,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1625
01:57:30,278 --> 01:57:31,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel, Ghetto Kool-Aid, but not

1626
01:57:50,902 --> 01:57:54,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel, the orange lounge choice of drink while playing DDR.

1627
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Another random note.

1628
01:57:56,704 --> 01:58:09,528
[SPEAKER_04]: A new test version of Max Extreme, or Max Extreme, DDR Extreme came out this week, and apparently Sakura has been removed as the extra stage replaced with another paranoia, and Black Lab would like me to take a minute to tease Loki about it.

1629
01:58:09,888 --> 01:58:10,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Tease, tease, tease.

1630
01:58:11,749 --> 01:58:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Your response.

1631
01:58:12,569 --> 01:58:13,989
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, the machine's not done yet.

1632
01:58:14,649 --> 01:58:19,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they've had the song done and completed, and it's a Konami original...

1633
01:58:20,186 --> 01:58:21,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't they put it in there?

1634
01:58:22,247 --> 01:58:24,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, there's going to be 200 fucking songs.

1635
01:58:24,468 --> 01:58:26,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be in the goddamn machine.

1636
01:58:26,989 --> 01:58:28,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be an extra stage.

1637
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:31,752
[SPEAKER_02]: No, guaranteed it's probably not going to be an extra stage because that would be kind of redundant.

1638
01:58:31,992 --> 01:58:34,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You play Max and you play Max again.

1639
01:58:35,013 --> 01:58:35,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be kind of stupid.

1640
01:58:35,994 --> 01:58:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be in the goddamn machine.

1641
01:58:37,915 --> 01:58:40,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge, the song's done.

1642
01:58:41,717 --> 01:58:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Konami original.

1643
01:58:43,858 --> 01:58:44,618
[SPEAKER_02]: What more do you need?

1644
01:58:46,169 --> 01:58:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's Loki's official response.

1645
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:50,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave has another random note he wants to bring up before the show's over.

1646
01:58:51,211 --> 01:58:55,532
[SPEAKER_09]: On a side note, I AAA'd the Remember Me or Remember You, what is it?

1647
01:58:55,892 --> 01:58:56,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And nothing.

1648
01:58:57,433 --> 01:58:58,773
[SPEAKER_09]: You obtained the highest dance level.

1649
01:58:59,274 --> 01:58:59,614
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1650
01:59:00,954 --> 01:59:02,695
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't get shit for AAAing anything, I don't think.

1651
01:59:02,735 --> 01:59:04,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you get one of the earlier unlocks.

1652
01:59:04,455 --> 01:59:06,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Something you've already unlocked by playing enough songs.

1653
01:59:07,296 --> 01:59:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and one more random note, because I promised you guys I would mention this in the chat room, I talked about this at the beginning of the show, somebody asked, when is Orange Lounge going three hours?

1654
01:59:18,345 --> 01:59:19,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been discussing this.

1655
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:22,487
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been discussing this, and we are going to up the show to three hours.

1656
01:59:22,747 --> 01:59:24,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to start... Eventually.

1657
01:59:24,308 --> 01:59:25,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tell them.

1658
01:59:25,709 --> 01:59:26,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's tell them.

1659
01:59:26,489 --> 01:59:28,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We will start that with episode number 20.

1660
01:59:28,631 --> 01:59:32,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 20 will be the first three-hour show, and that is, by the way, in two weeks.

1661
01:59:33,373 --> 01:59:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, we're going to be just too fucking exhausting after Shaft, I think.

1662
01:59:36,515 --> 01:59:40,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a lot of Shaft wrap-up, a lot of interviews, a lot of out-of-towners next Sunday.

1663
01:59:40,897 --> 01:59:41,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be a big show.

1664
01:59:41,578 --> 01:59:43,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first three-hour show will be in two weeks.

1665
01:59:43,078 --> 01:59:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what do you want?

1666
01:59:43,879 --> 01:59:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, man, we're doing an eight-hour show.

1667
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1668
01:59:48,795 --> 01:59:52,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and Jamie's got some things she's talking about for the afterbirth here.

1669
01:59:52,678 --> 01:59:59,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for the afterbirth we'll go a little bit old school so I can, you know, let you know about one of the greatest and least appreciated systems ever.

1670
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and give me some more, everybody go around and give us your final thought, because I'm still trying to get the show, end of show wrap-up in here.

1671
02:00:09,177 --> 02:00:11,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, final thought, actually, I didn't get to do it.

1672
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:13,821
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, go for it.

1673
02:00:14,742 --> 02:00:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Really not too much going on other than the DDR Max USA DWI is coming out, thanks to me, and Team Guilo Max, I guess.

1674
02:00:23,428 --> 02:00:26,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, speaking of Team Guilo, they're gone again.

1675
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where they went.

1676
02:00:27,991 --> 02:00:30,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It's news to me, so they're just bye-bye.

1677
02:00:31,174 --> 02:00:34,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And X-Step Release Candidate 4 is out.

1678
02:00:34,756 --> 02:00:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also probably going to be version 1, so go check that out if you use it or not.

1679
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:49,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, other than that, I'm going to be getting back onto the 2DX project, so I'll have more of those 2DX sim files coming out for you guys to play on StepMania.

1680
02:00:51,068 --> 02:00:52,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it.

1681
02:00:52,429 --> 02:00:53,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Dave, any final thoughts?

1682
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:58,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Homework blows ass.

1683
02:00:58,992 --> 02:00:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1684
02:01:00,332 --> 02:01:08,815
[SPEAKER_09]: MaxUSA, if anyone knows how to get the Hardcore 21 unlock, tell Rob, or post it, so I can look.

1685
02:01:09,135 --> 02:01:09,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1686
02:01:09,836 --> 02:01:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, your final thought?

1687
02:01:13,177 --> 02:01:14,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides your random coughing fits.

1688
02:01:17,078 --> 02:01:21,040
[SPEAKER_07]: All of you people, go play Kid Dracula.

1689
02:01:22,429 --> 02:01:23,610
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll love me for it.

1690
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:25,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Play Kid Dracula in Konami World.

1691
02:01:25,832 --> 02:01:28,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Go obscure, because I say so.

1692
02:01:29,254 --> 02:01:29,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And drink Propel.

1693
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:32,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And come to Shaft.

1694
02:01:32,736 --> 02:01:33,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to Shaft.

1695
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought of the night.

1696
02:01:35,258 --> 02:01:38,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to Shaft, and I need a date.

1697
02:01:39,141 --> 02:01:40,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1698
02:01:41,042 --> 02:01:41,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1699
02:01:41,502 --> 02:01:43,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be playing more music for you after the show's over.

1700

[SPEAKER_06]: From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes.

1714
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:38,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark, you lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack on while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.
