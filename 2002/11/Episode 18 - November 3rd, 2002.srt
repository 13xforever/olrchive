00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,520
contain many four-letter words. Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,400
The last Metroid is in captivity.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:08,400
The galaxy is at peace.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,480
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Ms. Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,480
One, one, he's good.

9
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,980
That's not that much.

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,480
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
How can you tell?

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
I never forget a pussy, cat.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Thirty-seven, my girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
In a row?

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
You are the weakest thing to bite.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,480
So you get nothing, you lose, good day sir.

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:53,980
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Dark Sakura

21
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I hate nature!

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Sky

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
Do I look like the weather girl?

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,980
Everything alright?

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,980
Orange Lounge Radio

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,900
We are live and this is episode number 18 for November the 3rd of 2002

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,920

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,420
Hey, I have Propella. Life is good.

42
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Except that stupid fly needs to get the hell out of here.

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,420
I know, and don't lady just swallow the fly.

44
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
I don't know why she swallowed the fly.

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Look, he's doing this whole karate kid thing here, trying to catch the fly.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,420
For our listeners, a fly has made it into the studio, and it's going to die sometime during the duration of the show.

47
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,420
Alright, we'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.

48
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,420
First we're going to take an opening break, and we're going to play a bunch of stuff from Max USA.

49
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,200
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,060
Why, leave me alone, don't tell me why

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,760
There is no need to carry on

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,200
Leave me alone if I'm not right

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,080
And why, leave me alone so many days

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,620
Just thinking I've been so many nights

55
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Leave me alone and don't know why

56
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Tell me why

57
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,620
Now tell me why

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

59
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
And blow me wide

60
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:37,620
It's a long way to go, honey I know, but I'm a Hawaii, where are we going?

61
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,620
To the dark black forest

62
00:06:37,620 --> 00:07:02,980
We interrupt this music for a special announcement.

63
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Loki has killed the fly.

64
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,480
What we gotta do is build momentum

65
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,980
If you need the right tools and best

66
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Ride the wave, start counting the rhythm of the march

67
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,780
Cause we got new whips and the main engine

68
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,480
Then I know I'll bite

69
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll either do it now or you'll have to bang those flowers

70
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,980
Yes, I reckon it's their fault

71
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,480
If you need the right tools, drop your balls

72
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,480
Yeah, yeah, drop your balls

73
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,980
Drop your balls

74
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,980
Let's just keep that ball

75
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah, we got this, build momentum

76
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,480
If you need the right tools and methods to ride the waves and come down to the rivers

77
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Don't rush, just insist we don't get with it

78
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Pain is scary, almighty, what are we even doing now?

79
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
You must have been going slower

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
You had no race to take that for

81
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
And it's up to you to hit that call

82
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
You dropped the ball

83
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
You dropped the ball

84
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
You dropped the ball

85
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
He dropped that bomb!

86
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Hey, you dropped that ball!

87
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:15,600
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

88
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,200
Watch all your favorite monster hosts, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki engage in the Bahmani

89
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Battle Royale.

90
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,200
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday at 7 p.m. Pacific time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.

91
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And be suitable for children under 6, pregnant women, retards, and residents of Baltimore.

92
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Are you ready? Ready for the race? Are you ready?

93
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,200
You're already listening to Orange Lounge Live Radio, but I hadn't played that promo yet during the live show, so I thought I would.

94
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,200
What do six-year-olds and retards have to do with it?

95
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I just decided I'd be random. And if you listen very carefully, it also says residents of Baltimore.

96
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Baltimore.

97
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
And we're picking on Baltimore because when I pulled up the stats for what cities listen

98
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,240
to us the most, Baltimore was in last place.

99
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,560
So we're picking on them, which is a bummer because Baltimore is where all the John Waters

100
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
films are set.

101
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,960
And if you know me, I love John Waters, so sorry.

102
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,320
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the Max USA crap that we just played for you.

103
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,240
It wasn't crap, it was more like diarrhea.

104
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,800
Max USA just came out this week and we're all happy happy.

105
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,500
It was really special.

106
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,160
I notice we have a lot of new people listening tonight, so I thought I'd point out some things

107
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
for you.

108
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,180
If you want to join our chat room, just go to any Othercide IRC server.

109
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,760
You're going to just put in your server as IRC.eggheads.org, or you're going to put in

110
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,680
karma.othercideirc.net, either one of those.

111
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,800
That's where all the big Mamani chat rooms are, and you're just going to join Channel

112
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,420
Pound, Orange Lounge.

113
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,800
That's where the cool kids hang out.

114
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
That's right.

115
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,960
If you're too lazy to get on IRC, that's cool, we're making an effort to keep our Yahoo box

116
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,240
online while we're doing the show, so you can just shoot us an email, it's orangeloungeradio,

117
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,040
that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, and we'll check that box throughout

118
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
the show.

119
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
That's for all the cool kids in the email!

120
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Thank you!

121
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,520
You want to be a cool kid, don't you?

122
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,040
While we're talking about, you know, station news and events, as you noticed in the beginning

123
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,760
of the show, we have decided to make Loki an official co-host now!

124
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
May as well, he's here all the time.

125
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
You know, this guy just shows up.

126
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,760
He sits over here. He gives commentary. We give him a segment.

127
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
We don't even let him sit in a chair.

128
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Um, here, I'll just get over.

129
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760
God damn it! Just like last week, there's people outside the studio here fucking honking at the neighbors.

130
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
We don't care!

131
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Shut up!

132
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Um...

133
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Where's my gun?

134
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Boom!

135
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
This is my boomstick!

136
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:58,760
We realize that your horn works, but we don't need to hear it!

137
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Yes, I'm very happy to be the- Oh, yeah, speech, speech, speech, speech!

138
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Yes.

139
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Thank you for all the little people, all the little people that supported me.

140
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Is it just me, or did the horn get, like, quieter, like it died?

141
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,760
I put the fear of DS into them. Where's my bat? Okay!

142
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,760
No, no, no, I have neighbors, Jamie, I have neighbors.

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
That horn gets a fuck you.

144
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,760
We'll do the fuck yous of the week with it later.

145
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,760
No, it stopped. It stopped. There you go, everything's fine now. Uh oh, uh oh.

146
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Thank you!

147
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,760
There we go. See, Jamie can be polite, too.

148
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Yeah.

149
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm sorry, did you have anything else to say?

150
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
I could have said, thank you bitches. Okay, fuck them.

151
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
He started up again.

152
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I wish we had a microphone outside, but we don't.

153
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
So the whole listening public out there is going,

154
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
what the hell are they talking about?

155
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Live on the horn, Mike.

156
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Jamie finally shut the window.

157
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes, right now I'm having Dave play my DDR Max save game so he can beat my Oni's for me.

158
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,480
suck at the Oni. I suck, I hate Onis, okay? I incredibly hate Onis, and when I found out

159
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,160
that you have to play the Oni courses to unlock songs, that really pissed me off. Well, you

160
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,040
don't have to, but if you want to get them, like, this month... I unlocked a song by failing

161
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,740
one. Now that's cool, that's something, that was the first thing that made me think, gosh,

162
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,720
this game really is for Americans. That you get unlocks by failing things. It's like,

163
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,540
good effort

164
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,480
just got created cyber today

165
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
that song was in economics

166
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,720
i love getting on walks from games i already owned

167
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,880
uh... that's my one bitch about max you at the max us having don't get me wrong

168
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
great game

169
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,480
pretty kick-ass

170
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,380
one of the best home releases they've done yet i really haven't decided if i

171
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,360
like that makes more if i like this one more but that is good it's definitely by

172
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
far

173
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
better than

174
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,080
the either the other two games you've got to tell us that's for sure they've

175
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,120
been called they had a data bank with

176
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
saved at that's what makes it stand out

177
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,560
now for me and my

178
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,760
i promise you'd be all

179
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,720
thirty here you say it's going to be

180
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,040
holy pointless because

181
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,320
i mean

182
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,320
you can't wear their kid

183
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,760
uh... pretty good so far

184
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,040
only courses are right

185
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,280
i just don't like them

186
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,280
You just like being able to see them. Like, if I wanted to play Oni, I could.

187
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Yeah, exactly. I want them to be there, maybe have, like, one song unlocked with an Oni, instead of, like, you know, the two last songs.

188
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,280
The songs you want most of all.

189
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Yeah, exactly. I mean, I can't possibly, you know, steal the steps and put them in sim files if, you know, I can't play them. Now can I?

190
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Speaking of which, you want to give a plug for your big contribution to the scene this week?

191
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Yeah, well, I would say I was helping NMR and those people, the crew of people that were supposedly making Max USA sim files,

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,280
this crew seemed to have pulled out two files, while myself, in like two days, pulled out eleven files.

193
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Didn't we time you last night? It took you about a half hour to get out, you leave me alone, like all six difficulties, single and double?

194
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
single and double?

195
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Yes.

196
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Singles and doubles, it took me 34 minutes.

197
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Nice.

198
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Yeah.

199
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I think I went to bed before you finished, but hey.

200
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah, it was fun.

201
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,360
I also finished last night, you know, the other five.

202
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,560
So everything's up except for Drop the Bomb, System FS, FX Mint, System SF, SF, yes, like

203
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
San Francisco.

204
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Yes.

205
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,560
System San Francisco mix, and the Do It Right.

206
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,280
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

207
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,840
And the Do It Right two-step harmonized mix, or whatever the hell that is, I don't even

208
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
know what it's called.

209
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
The decent version of Do It Right, basically.

210
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,760
I guess, yeah, whatever.

211
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
You like the original?

212
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
I like the original.

213
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Why?

214
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I prefer the original.

215
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,880
I like the bass in it better.

216
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I really do.

217
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Alright, fair enough.

218
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm entitled to.

219
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,360
You can like whatever you want, Jamie, that's fine.

220
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,320
Except Let Them Move, no one's allowed to like that song except Gwen.

221
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Because I say so.

222
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I'm the chick. Thank you.

223
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Because you're the chick.

224
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Look, the horn drove off.

225
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
What are you looking at, Loki?

226
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Loki's...

227
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
The fly is still...

228
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Oh, he's looking to see the...

229
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
But the fly, by the way,

230
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
which we left twitching on the windowsill,

231
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
has managed to slide off and is stuck to the edge of it.

232
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

233
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
We have...

234
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Now the fly is actually dead.

235
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
There was the fly's last moment on this earth.

236
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
See you in hell, fly.

237
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
The fly is now splattered against a Propel bottle.

238
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Dave's back in the room.

239
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Hi, Dave.

240
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
What do you want to say about Max USA, Dave?

241
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
That's really good.

242
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Dark Black Forest is really cool.

243
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
That's right. That's what I do like about Max USA.

244
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
This is what they did right.

245
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,320
They didn't just do it right, they did it fucking better than right.

246
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,320
The licensed USA tracks fucking rule.

247
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Dark Black Forest is one of the best Bamani songs ever.

248
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
And I will cut you if you think any different.

249
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
He's going to cut you.

250
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
And You Leave Me Alone is something...

251
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
It sounds like it's right off like a Dance Mania album, but better.

252
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,480
I don't know who thought to license those songs because I certainly never heard them before max USA

253
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,180
I don't know anybody that did know those songs except or Loki you said you thought you'd heard

254
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,400
Dark black forest before or somebody on the show said they heard that before I don't know

255
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,480
I'd never heard it before all right. You know they announced it. It's a very hard song to find

256
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,420
I'm very concerned because the trucker there looks like a guy who walked out with a bag of something and went to the other house

257
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,040
That's probably kale cocaine don't worry about it, okay

258
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,040
But I swear, that's the one thing they did right. Those license tracks rule. I don't know who thought to pick those.

259
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:58,040
They were cool except for I Like To Move It, which that song sucks! God, I hate that song! I Like To Move It, real to real.

260
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I would like to say that that Move It song, yeah.

261
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,320
No, I just want to say that they could have done better on making the songs harder though,

262
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
like Sandstorm, I wanted it to be hard.

263
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,320
It's just like Freezeras, they went overboard on the Freezeras way too much.

264
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,940
Okay, if SCK was here right now, which he's not, so he can't bitch at us whenever we make

265
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,040
fun of Max José, he'd say, that's what edit mode's for.

266
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,680
Yeah, I know, but they went way overboard on the Freezeras.

267
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,840
They're like, hey, we've got a new mode that we can use.

268
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Let me make you steps.

269
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Yeah.

270
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,720
Sandstorm is a cool song, but they made shitty-ass steps for it.

271
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,720
They need to do the doodle doodle doodle doodle doo, but instead they were like, freeze, freeze,

272
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
note, note, note, freeze.

273
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, the thing I was disappointed in is there's no new Katas.

274
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
None at all.

275
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, that was kind of weird that there's no new Katas, but I guess that's to be gentle

276
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
to us stupid Americans.

277
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,440
Oh, and- God damn it.

278
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,200
It's the fucking horn again.

279
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,640
And I beat the adrenaline oni for Lucky.

280
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Pizza.

281
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Maybe it's the pizza guy honking.

282
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
I don't know.

283
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Look, he ran to get his pizza.

284
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,840
Then we'll get our pizza and then shoot him.

285
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Get our pizza and throw it.

286
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
We'll pull a Braveheart on him.

287
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,040
We'll throw artichoke hearts at the...

288
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm going to eat those.

289
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,960
What do you think about getting old DanceMania tracks that were licensed for Japan and getting

290
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,080
some of those on USA?

291
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,640
I must admit, I thought it was fucking cool that Captain Jack was on Max USA.

292
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,200
and it's just like that was the coolest thing ever. Captain Jack.

293
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
I was feeling really crappy when I started playing my game, so I only thumb-bumped it

294
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,260
and didn't get very far into it. But, you know, Brilliant to You, Orchestra Group was

295
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,320
on there, so that made me instantly a happy bunny. And me being the only person who likes

296
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Love That Feelin', I was ecstatic to have that song in the game.

297
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
What? Uh-oh.

298
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
Dave has just unlocked Do It Right, the two-step harmonizer.

299
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,420
How'd he do it?

300
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,500
you beat the adrenaline, Oni. So guess what? You're going to see a sim file for that on

301
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,020
my site tonight. Alright. Cool. You heard it here first, I guess. Happy, happy, joy,

302
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:14,540
joy. Did you notice the interesting use of some of the recycled videos, like how Love

303
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,580
This Feelin' has the Let's Groove video in it? I didn't. I don't know if you looked into

304
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,140
it that much. I was just happy it was there. Dan was there and I didn't want to torture

305
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:30,020
was the multi-genre, multi-tempo song, even though I like it.

306
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,220
Twen says he loves Love This Feelin', and he made me play it on Wednesday's little thing,

307
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
which is true.

308
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,020
I don't know what to think about that, because he also likes Let Them Move.

309
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,880
No, I actually, you know, you've got good taste, thank you.

310
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,460
If you were missing it, this is one of the reasons why you want to listen to Orange Lounge,

311
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,200
you know, throughout the week as well.

312
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,560
On Wednesday night when we picked up the game, I came in here and had this elaborate set

313
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,480
up in here and unfortunately Jamie was at home playing it herself and Loki wasn't here.

314
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
Jamie was at home sick.

315
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
Jamie was at home sick and playing it for yourself but I just got on the stream, fired

316
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,520
up the Orange Lounge stream and just started playing it on air and playing all the new

317
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,640
tracks and stuff so if you listen during the week sometimes you get little surprises like

318
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,080
that so you listen to the Orange Lounge all the time.

319
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,960
I would still like to say that I'm still having an open commission I guess for someone to

320
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,380
make me, you know, dynamite r5. Remember that JB made you that one. I mean... In the way

321
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,380
that you imagined it in your head. A professionally styled mixed one. You didn't like JB's version?

322
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,500
It was special. Thank you JB. It was special. Maybe we'll have to play... It's not quite

323
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,520
the way I envisioned it to be. Didn't we actually play that on a show? No. Oh, then maybe we

324
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,660
ought to play that later. I don't know. I don't even know if I still have it. Hopefully

325
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:56,460
I do. We'll see. You made JB cry. No, I didn't cry. Oh. No, look. It was good, but it's not

326
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,340
how I envisioned it. I guess you'd have to sort of read my mind. Okay. New one. Okay.

327
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Okay, a new one.

328
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,540
Um, what's a good one that will work?

329
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:25,860
How about mixing hollick with, um, no, not stoic, mix hollick with, um, um, um, um,

330
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
gentle stress.

331
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,380
Hollick doesn't really mix though because it's different measures.

332
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:59,380
I remember saying on DDR Freak a while back,

333
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,260
Why not just call him Exotic?

334
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,580
And I think somebody ran with that.

335
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,300
I've heard that used again lately, but you know.

336
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
It's all good.

337
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,660
I really would want to see something like Kiss Me or Temple of Love and DDR.

338
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
It would be rad.

339
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,380
Well, we've already seen those songs in DDR.

340
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,140
A year and a half before I had even heard of DDR, there was a song that my friend sent

341
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,340
me called Don't Talk Dirty, which was the very first erotic song I ever heard.

342
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,420
And I would like that to be in DDR.

343
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
That song owns.

344
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
I'll play that later.

345
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,420
We have it.

346
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I do have it.

347
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
Okay.

348
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
That'd make me a happy bunny.

349
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,420
I need to put lollipop in DDR.

350
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
What?

351
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Lollipop!

352
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Lollipop!

353
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
No, not that.

354
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,140
No, the DJ Alligator Project lollipop.

355
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,620
Suck on my lollipop.

356
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,020
I wanna lick it.

357
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,100
Last week on Orange Lounge and Honors.

358
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,140
Hey, I'll bring that song.

359
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,660
It's awesome.

360
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,260
Black Lab has announced he'd like to see Dr. Dick in DDR.

361
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Help me, Dr. Tick.

362
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Max, don't have sex with your ex?

363
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Hey, they have the 2003 one, or 2002 version of that.

364
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Yeah, on the new Dance Media Red, or not Red, uh, EX.

365
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Dance Media EX one.

366
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Oh, Dance Media Extreme!

367
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Ooh, zing!

368
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,260
I still fear that, you know, I hope what Dan said doesn't come to pass for DDR.

369
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
What's that?

370
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,260
So once they release a series of games and then add Extreme to the end of the most recent release, that means the series is about to die.

371
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,260
But if it's coming, it's gotta be the final, right?

372
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Yeah, it'd have to be like, you know, DDR Extreme Super Duper Extreme Fun Dance Party Final Mix 2, or something like that, I don't know.

373
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,260
I think that DDR Happy Crack makes and they have it all happy hardcore.

374
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,520
but we're ending it now.

375
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,120
Well, could that mean that they're going to be starting over with some new kind of

376
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,560
dance game?

377
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,080
Oh my god, it's 8 panel DDR or something?

378
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,160
You know, DDR2DX?

379
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,280
No, then we'd have Technomotion.

380
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,760
Exactly.

381
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,320
Is the pizza here?

382
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,600
Oh no, it wasn't. Oh, that was a false alarm.

383
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,060
I'm sorry to hear that.

384
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,500
Dick with the horn.

385
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
That sucks.

386
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
He hasn't honked in a while, though.

387
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Yeah, but if he does it next week, I swear I'm going to go over there and cut off his hands.

388
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,500
And then if he uses his head, I'll just cut that off, too. And then we'll make him eat it.

389
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Oh, we hear a yes from the other room.

390
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Oh, I wonder what Dave got. Dave might have unlocked something else. We'll see.

391
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I bet he'd be dead.

392
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Any other thoughts you have on Max Roseanne?

393
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,540
it's pretty and by the way I have to give a big pile you know a big six you

394
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,980
know bar box of kudos to Jason Enos for those funny little yeah oh I completely

395
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,780
forgot about that that is one of the best parts of Max USA is information

396
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,420
mode I laughed my ass off so bad reading some of those I have to I have to see if

397
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,380
I can pull one of them up my friend took a picture one of those so funny those

398
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,140
little information modes that you get whenever what you unlock a new song or

399
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,140
Yeah, whenever you play a song.

400
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,140
Well, some it works with the unlocks, but I think that it's mainly when you actually play the song.

401
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,140
I have to read one of them. It was so hilarious. Let's see if I can find it.

402
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Yes, I do have it, it looks like.

403
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
We have one.

404
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Okay, this is for When You Unlock So In Love. It says,

405
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:07,140
You have unlocked the song So In Love by Caramel S, oozing with stories of love just like melted caramel over a hot flame.

406
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,660
flame this down tempo song has elements of 70s pop smooth jazz and lounge all

407
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,700
rolled into every bite yum that is so cool that was my favorite just that they

408
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:25,140
have yum that was so cool three little letters add so much they really do is

409
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,460
there another one I have here oh yes this is this is another one that's very

410
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,860
popular I think this is already posted on some message boards but you have

411
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,780
failed game mode for the first time as a result you've unlocked the song

412
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,380
celebrate by JJ company now you can celebrate your first failure in style

413
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,100
but don't give up on your dream to be the ultimate dancer which by the way is

414
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:55,900
one of the most god-awful songs I've ever heard in DDR oh this is a

415
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,580
information mode when you oh anyway maybe we'll play that later too maybe

416
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,340
I'll play celebrate just to torture everybody no he just beat candy on

417
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,140
on first stage, so I unlocked Candy.

418
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,840
Ah, cool.

419
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Now he's playing home base, the 17 song oni.

420
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Eee!

421
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
What do you get when you beat that, though?

422
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Don't you get a...

423
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Let's drop the bomb.

424
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
No, you get to drop the bomb with 21.

425
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Oh, that's um...

426
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Is there anything else you haven't unlocked yet?

427
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,340
Spin the disc.

428
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,840
Oh, spin the disc, that's a good one.

429
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Spin the disc, and the last one's drop the bomb.

430
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
I hope it's drop the bomb.

431
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You never know.

432
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Drop the bomb is in this one.

433
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed online.

434
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
You have to beat the 21 song oni to get it.

435
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It's really...

436
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
I mean, it starts off with a three footer

437
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,840
And the hardest song in there is going to be Midnight Blaze, Maniac. That's it.

438
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Tal says that failing an Oni gets you gentle stress.

439
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:54,840
And that's true. There was a really funny information that says Oni Mode can be so stressful, but smooth out with a sensual song.

440
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Yeah, I remember that one because of course I failed my Oni on the first song because I don't like Onis either.

441
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:28,840
I am not at all unhappy that the Superstar remix is not there.

442
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I know you hate that remix. What's the one, the M2 step from 6 style? There was an M2 step, I believe that was supposed to be in there too. I wonder what happened to those?

443
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Also, I think More Deep was on there too.

444
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Maybe, I don't remember.

445
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Let's see what else was supposed to be on there. I don't know. My guess, if anything, since they probably did have some data for those, Max2, that's all.

446
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,840
I think it'll be interesting, maybe somebody can go into the disc and see if they can find images for an emesis and things like that.

447
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm surprised nobody's thought to go in and see if those are in there.

448
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
I'm sure people have thought of that.

449
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Actually, they're working on it right now. There's a guy that I talked to on DVR maniacs that was doing like hex editing on there.

450
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,840
He was like a cracker at one time, so he's, you know,

451
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Cracker!

452
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,200
new new new new new new new new new

453
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,400
ninety he's supposed to go in there to rip uh...

454
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,920
high-quality like backgrounds and the videos

455
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,920
now the court they could find us a consistent somebody going to u s a mix

456
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,000
and actually found like a bad girls background with a hand

457
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,040
things like that is also uh...

458
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,600
uh... aid of uh... game shark

459
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,520
with comics uh... they sound uh... notes that were

460
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
in the fourth...

461
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,640
Whoa, because they basically ripped a fourth mix, right?

462
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,280
Yeah, but they found all of those...

463
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Challenge mode and things like that.

464
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,440
I was kind of sad that challenge mode didn't make it into Max, but, eh...

465
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Challenge mode was evil.

466
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
I guess that's kind of...

467
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Well, that's what they kind of called Oni mode, but, eh, that was always fun.

468
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
This is a challenging mode.

469
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
I just love the picture of Double-T.

470
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
I'm not going to cry about it, but, yeah.

471
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,000
And remember, there's STDs in DDR Max.

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,080
Did you notice, though, that when you're actually playing the game, that it still has the little

473
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,280
characters, the Asian ones?

474
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Yeah.

475
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Crazy, huh?

476
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,860
it's like whoops somebody got lazy and also on the high score screens it says

477
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,760
DDR6

478
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,080
yeah but that's kinda it's kinda so subtle because it kinda goes with the

479
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,000
whole little theme

480
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,560
the modernization theme they had going with that but you don't really notice it

481
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,480
yeah it's still cool

482
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,480
don't get us wrong I'm just glad that you know

483
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,040
they would have had to put it on a DVD for as much crap as they put in there

484
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,400
they did it is on DVD I mean crap in a positive sense you know it was nice crap

485
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,240
you know it fertilizes your

486
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,360
The only other thing that also disappointed me about Max USA is that the back of the box

487
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,520
says something like it links up with Konomics for special stuff, and basically what it means

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,840
when you read it in the manual, you can load your edits from Konomics.

489
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,580
You know, it's kind of like, that was such a big disappointment.

490
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,320
I don't think it even should have been, I mean, duh.

491
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,660
You can't even, at least I haven't tried it, but I'm almost positive because the fourth

492
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,660
it's not like you could make an edit with free zeroes and put it into economics, so it's not even really 100% true.

493
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,660
You could, but they just wouldn't show up.

494
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:28,660
The thing I was kind of laughing at the whole time while playing DDR Max was how much they're advertising for economics in the information screen.

495
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,660
It's just like, go buy. Go buy economics. Go buy. Come on. Go. Go.

496
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Well, Konomics is probably down to 1999 by now, right?

497
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
I think most of the PS1 games are.

498
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Last check, Konomics was at $29.99 at GameStop.

499
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,660
I would imagine eventually it'll probably go down to 1999 though, right?

500
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
As most of the PS1 games probably will.

501
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Eventually, but it still sells.

502
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.

503
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
No question about it.

504
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,660
If you're hooking new people onto DDR, I suppose why not let them know that Konomics is out there?

505
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,460
Of course, they didn't try to sell any copies of USAMIX, but that's okay because USAMIX

506
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,740
was kind of crappy.

507
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:13,660
It was better than I would have expected for a first release.

508
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,420
Because if you keep in mind, they were testing the waters.

509
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:24,060
From what I understand, Konami had little faith that DDR was going to be that big as

510
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
it is now.

511
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:30,700
I've noticed each release has been progressively better, so now we have exactly just about

512
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
the same product.

513
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,180
We have a better one that was released in Japan.

514
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,460
I agree to an extent about the first mix.

515
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,580
I think they kind of should have already known from success in the arcades, from rabid following

516
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,920
such as DDR Freak, things like that.

517
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,980
The fact that import machines are more popular than the U.S. machines, I kind of would have

518
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,740
expected a little bit more faith.

519
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,700
But they really didn't have that much.

520
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,820
the fact of the matter, they didn't. You know, it took convincing. And so, but, you know,

521
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,220
we have it now. Disney Mix, on the other hand, was an improvement

522
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,100
over the Japanese one, I thought. I don't think so.

523
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,220
It was missing some of the good songs. It missed all the songs that I liked.

524
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,800
But it had Maniac Mode and, you know. I really liked playing the oldies. I mean,

525
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,260
I loved playing Mr. Bassman, I loved playing Surfin' USA. I hate the Macarena, though.

526
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,020
I sort of understand, you know, why they couldn't license them though, so, you know, it makes

527
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
sense.

528
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
They took out fire.

529
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
I'm hoping that they do...

530
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,420
Not fire, they took out an electric light parade.

531
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,820
Yeah, they took out the electric light parade, which is weird.

532
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,380
I kind of hope if they do do a Disney Mix 2 that we'll get the catch-up song.

533
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
No.

534
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
Never.

535
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Never.

536
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:46,100
And Dance Magic is still that thing that, you know, really should be put into DDR mainstream,

537
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,960
but still hasn't happened yet.

538
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,080
Maybe that's something that we're going to see.

539
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,500
If they truly are starting over with DDR, maybe the next series of DDR will be more

540
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
competitive.

541
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,200
That's kind of what I'd like to see, maybe a more competitive version of DDR.

542
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I miss battle.

543
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I miss dance battle.

544
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
Dance battle from second mix, dance magic.

545
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,560
I actually almost miss couple steps.

546
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Having couple steps.

547
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,680
Second mix was the last one to happen that I understand.

548
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Didn't third?

549
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
I don't know.

550
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Maybe not.

551
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,040
Well, you can always do couples edits.

552
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,960
But it's not the same.

553
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,760
You know, I miss going up to a DDR machine and having to tell it to do versus.

554
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,060
You know, I remember going up to the 1.5 and holding my buttons down so I could play in

555
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,060
versus mode so that we could have the same nifty little steps.

556
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,280
You know, I kind of miss it.

557
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,400
I almost miss having to stomp around and do a code to put in maniac and I miss being totally

558
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,480
messed up when USA came out because I was so used to playing on flat.

559
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Right.

560
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Okay.

561
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,360
Well, we're going to take a real quick break and then we're going to come back and we'll

562
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,180
talk a little bit more about Max USA, we'll talk about some other stuff.

563
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,120
You know, while Max USA has been kind of taking everyone's attention lately, there's been

564
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,220
other news going on too, so we'll get to that.

565
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,680
And a whole lot more, we've got a listless segment for you guys tonight, so do stay tuned

566
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,940
and we will be right back for you guys eventually and we're going to start this off with a song

567
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,300
that we kind of referenced a little bit during this last break later

568
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:26,300
here.

569
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,300
Give me in your arms and go for my obsession Give me all your passion

570
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Don't talk dirty to me

571
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Oh, touch me

572
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,300

573
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,300

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,820

576
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,340
I'm in love with you, I know it hurts If love is you, so let it work

577
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:08,340
I'm gonna use my heart and flow It's just to make you lose control

578
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Touch me with your love And give me satisfaction

579
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,340
When we get into action But don't talk dirty

580
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Take me in your arms And go for my obsession

581

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Oh, you're gonna touch me

585
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
And I'm gonna lose you all

586
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
It's a long, long night

587
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
It's a long, long night

588
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Don't wanna lose

589
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
You hate your clothes

590
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Then I'm the one

591
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
I'm the one you chose

592
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
I always kid you like it too

593
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Tell you babe

594
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Don't be cruel

595
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
We got a day

596
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
We got a night

597
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
To hold each other

598
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Really tight

599
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
When I get loud

600
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
You know what?

601
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm gonna let my body talk

602
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,840
Touch me with your mouth and give me satisfaction

603
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,840
When we get into action but don't talk dirty

604
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Take me in your arms and go for my obsession

605
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,340
Give me all the passion but don't talk dirty to me

606
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Don't talk dirty to me

607
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,340
Don't talk dirty to me

608
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
Don't touch me

609
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Oh, you gotta touch me

610
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,340
Oh, don't talk dirty

611
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
Oh, give me some action

612
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,340
I need your satisfaction

613
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,340
Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction

614
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,340
When we get into action

615
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,340
But don't talk dirty

616
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Take me in your arms and go for my obsession

617
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Give me all your passion

618
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Don't talk dirty to me

619
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction

620
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,340
We get into action, but don't talk dirty

621
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Take me in your arms and go for my obsession

622
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Give me all the fashion, but don't talk dirty to me

623
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Don't talk dirty to me

624
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Don't talk dirty to me, baby

625
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Just touch me

626
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Oh, you gotta touch me

627
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Oh, don't call daddy

628
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Oh, oh

629
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Oh

630
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:55,700
Well go over London Well go over London

631
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Rockover Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio. It's a good place to listen to the music.

632
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,700
That's not going to make sense to anybody unless you were listening that one Friday night.

633
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

634
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Whee!

635
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Whee!

636
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,700
And we've been talking about Max USA and I believe Dave's in the other room right now trying to get through what?

637
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:22,700
He's on Homebase, the 17 song oni. He's on song 11 at the moment.

638
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:32,700
And he's passed all the hard stuff. The only thing that I would be iffy on, because I haven't actually seen him in play yet, is the Do It Right two-step harmonize and the very last one, the Drop The Bomb system FX.

639
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Oh, has he not even played that Do It Right mix yet?

640
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,700
He played it once.

641
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Oh, okay.

642
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,700
And it didn't sound like it was too difficult.

643
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Is Drop The Bomb in that 17 song only?

644
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Yes.

645
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Oh, okay. So you'll have to go watch him play that song, huh?

646
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
Yeah.

647
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
He can at least get one look at the arrows.

648
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,700
Remember, I can get a pad and paper now.

649
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,580
Exactly. Other things that we could talk about in news this week that you might have missed.

650
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,100
Big news for us locally, we had a tournament Saturday.

651
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,140
Big tournament, huge NorCal tournament this Saturday.

652
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,500
Jamie, you want to talk about this Saturday's tourney?

653
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,660
We are having

654
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,380
Sac de Mani host another fabulous tournament.

655
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,780
It's going to be, the festivities begin at 10 o'clock

656
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,660
at the Scandia on Hillsdale

657
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,180
Hillsdale and I-80, well it's Madison and I-80, if you can find Madison and I-80 you can find

658
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,620
Scandia, it's right off the freeway

659
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,100
registration starts at 10 o'clock right when the place opens

660
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,340
accuracy attack starts at 1115

661
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,580
not perfect attack, accuracy attack, we're having two lines, we are having plenty of

662
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,380
prizes

663
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,260
aren't we? Loki, tell us about everybody who shows up has a chance to win

664
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,380
huge prizes. Tell us about this.

665
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,140
Oh boy. Well, I'm estimating already I'm bringing at least three or

666
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,100
four hundred DVDs, at least, and probably more than that. So...

667
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,340
So why don't we have an opening stipulation for the first, say,

668
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,140
twenty people who pre-register? They get a DVD? Or something, shit.

669
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,740
Oh, there's pizza. Okay, so, um, yeah, as you heard, about

670
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,060
three to four hundred various DVDs that we're gonna be giving away.

671
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,480
Now, we're not going to lie, they're not like cream of the crop type DVDs, but they are

672
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
good stuff.

673
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,520
There is great good stuff in there.

674
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,400
It's a lot of anime stuff.

675
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
It's not all anime, though.

676
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,580
We know not everybody who's in the DDR is an anime fan, like I don't know shit about

677
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,780
a lot of animes.

678
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,200
But there's some other stuff in there, too.

679
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,240
There's some great sci-fi stuff, and bling bling, and things like that.

680
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,620
Just tons and tons of DVDs are given away.

681
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,520
So just show up, because you might win something.

682
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,600
I mean, there's a very good chance you're going to walk out of there with something.

683
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,520
20 people who end up pre-registering are going to walk away with a DVD as well.

684
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,960
Well, yeah, at least for 20 who pre-register will get a DVD.

685
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,160
Yep, at least. So, it's going to be tons of prizes.

686
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,640
Do we want to talk about what kind of prizes are going to be given away?

687
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,040
Some of the special things that have been donated, or are we going to talk about that later?

688
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,240
Okay, it's going to be secret. You'll find out day of turning, however we are going to make

689
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,200
as Orange Lounge, we're going to be making a donation of a prize.

690
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,280
Yes. The Orange Pack. The Orange Pack will be donated as a prize. Orange Lounge

691
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,080
Radio is going to be donating an Orange Pack.

692
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Yes, we've already bought one of the things for it. It's funny.

693
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
Yes, and...

694
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Is that the pizza?

695
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,600
That wasn't the pizza. Oh, okay, cool. We'll take another break pretty soon then. But for

696
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,240
those that cannot make Shaft, because we know that we're an international show at this point,

697
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,000
we have lots of listeners in Japan, hello to you guys, thanks a lot for listening. Canada

698
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,960
as well, got a lot of listeners, eh? And where else do we have a lot of listeners that I've

699
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
been noticing?

700
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
Australia.

701
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Australia, yes.

702
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Australia, Australia! We love you!

703
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,960
A place I am dying to visit someday. Australia, we have a lot of listeners there.

704
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,960
And all over the globe, thanks to you guys for listening.

705
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
If you guys can't be there, that's okay.

706
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,960
We will bring Shaft to your living room.

707
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Yes.

708
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Or your computer room, or wherever you have your computer.

709
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
You can get the Shaft.

710
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,960
We are going to be broadcasting live from Shaft all day long.

711
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,960
The stream will start probably before the doors even open.

712
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Sometime at 9 or 10 in the morning.

713
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
We might get bored once we have everything set up.

714
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,960
Yeah, we might get bored once everything's set up.

715
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,960
We'll sing a little song.

716
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Loki's going to pretty much be in charge of this,

717
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,960
because Jaime's kind of the queen of the tournament,

718
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,960
so she's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off,

719
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,960
making sure everything's in order.

720
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
I'm the Empress, what you talking about?

721
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,960
And I'm going to be kind of emceeing the tournament with my buddy Tal,

722
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
going to be up there doing the emcee duties.

723
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,960
So when Tal's doing the emcee stuff, though,

724
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,960
I'll be in the back helping Loki out with interviews,

725
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,960
but pretty much it's all going to be on Loki.

726
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
So welcome aboard as co-hosts.

727
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
Now do eight hours of radio all by yourself.

728
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Oh yeah. Gotta catch up.

729
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,960
So basically anybody who wants to, as you come off the stage from Perfect Attack,

730
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
from Freestyle, whatever...

731
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,960
What? No?

732
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Accuracy Attack.

733
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Sorry, Accuracy Attack. I gotta get in the habit too.

734
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
Can you say Perfect Attack?

735
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,960
I'm sorry, this ain't your mama's Perfect Attack.

736
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,960
As they come off the stage from Accuracy Attack, or Freestyle, or A-Team Freestyle...

737
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,960
This so sounded like Cartman.

738
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
A-Team.

739
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,960
Okay, whatever. I'm coming to talk about what I want to do, bitch!

740
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
Jeez, Carmen!

741
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,960
As you guys finish, you can just walk right into the room. You'll be escorted into the office and get the shit beaten out of you.

742
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,960
No, and you'll be able to be interviewed for as long as you tell all your friends to listen.

743
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:37,960
And if you are there at the event, you can't listen, that's okay, we'll rebroadcast it probably at least twice on the station at some point.

744
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,960
If I can get it to archive, I can't guarantee it will be rebroadcasted though, we might not be able to get it to archive.

745
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,960
So I've just got to get you guys all to listen on Saturday if you can.

746
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
Yep.

747
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Yeah.

748
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Anything else you want- oh, I burped.

749
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Anything else you want to add about Shaft?

750
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,960
That was a brilliant radio.

751
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,960
I'll be there judging.

752
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:27,960
The address for pre-registration is shaftstaffatyahoo.com.

753
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,960
Make sure that you actually look at the webpage first.

754
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Go to sacbemanani.com

755
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Just go to sacbemanani.com and follow the link.

756
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,960
That is the actual address that the pre-reg information is on.

757
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Of course you can just go to sacbemanani.com

758
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Click the link, click on shaft, and look there too.

759
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,460
But, you know, me, I always like going directly to the site, because that's just me.

760
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,880
But, anyway, go ahead and have a look at it. Make sure, though, that you do not leave any

761
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
information out

762
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,720
if you do not know what song you want to do. By the way, the songs

763
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,260
are located under the rules section. Yeah,

764
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,840
accuracy attack songs are up. But make sure that you,

765
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840
if you don't know what song you want to do, write

766
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,080
TBA to be announced, and you can decide your song day of.

767
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,000
But keep in mind, all qualifying songs will be done in dark reverse.

768
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,320
The reason for this being, we'll go ahead and make an official statement on it.

769
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,640
If you can play going normally, you should be able to play in reverse.

770
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,320
That's a test of your reading.

771
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,060
Dark should not make a difference because that is the test of your rhythm.

772
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,520
We are going for accuracy.

773
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,800
That's kind of a way to, it takes away the blinking of the arrows too, so it makes it

774
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,680
a little bit difficult because I know when IPA, I'm looking at, or AA in this case, I'm

775
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,680
I'm looking at the blink of an arrow a lot of the time to get the tempo, so I would kind of be fucked in that aspect, so it makes it a little more difficult.

776
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,680
This is a judge of accuracy. You know, I would love to see you try to do something in Dark Reverse.

777
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,680
Well, sucks that I'm going to be up there doing, uh, I can't participate because I already know all the songs.

778
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:09,680
And we're going to be at Scandia before then. I want to see you take the Shaft Challenge.

779
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
I think I can handle Shaft.

780
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
Let's see if you can get the Shaft.

781
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
I think I might like getting, anyway.

782
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,000
Well, is that special?

783
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,660
Also accuracy attack, very game show.

784
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:30,160
The way we've got the brackets set up, very suspenseful, at least as much as a DDR tournament

785
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
can be.

786
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,360
Don't rely on what we've named the categories.

787
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,000
We've got category names are starting to float around out there.

788
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,820
Nobody knows, I say three people I believe, on the planet, literally three people know

789
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,460
what are in those envelopes.

790
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,180
only two of us actually have them written down. Yes, and only two of us actually were

791
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:55,340
there to write them down. So, Naughty Scandy doesn't know what's in those envelopes? Nope.

792
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,040
The Best Piers Nation don't know what's in those envelopes? They can't be told either.

793
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,780
You can try bribing me. It ain't gonna work. You know, I might let one song out for $100.

794
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,660
I wanted to wear a big sequined jacket to do the MCU. You totally need to do the Rod

795
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:18,060
We're going to take a really quick break because there's food here and we want to get some

796
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,020
food so we're going to play some Groovilicious 70's tune to get everybody in the mood for

797
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,500
a shaft and then we'll come back and talk some more about some other DDR things going

798
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
on.

799
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,920
We hope you guys can tune in on Saturday starting at around 9 to 10 am for the Big Shaft live

800
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
stream.

801
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Alright, we'll be right back.

802
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Share the price of life

803
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Baby, fight it right

804
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
We gonna move tonight

805
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Baby, move tonight

806
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Share the price of life

807
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,240
Baby, fight it right

808
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,720
We gonna move tonight

809
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,720
Ooh, let's just go

810
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Alright

811
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Ooh, let's just go

812
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,720
Stand up, stand up, stand up

813
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,720
Let's just go

814
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
Out of the field

815
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,720
Alright, alright, alright

816
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,720
Let's just go

817
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,720
Say you should

818
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Couldn't stand up all right, all right

819
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
DJ bring the beat on

820
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,720
Oh, my God.

821
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
Oh, my God.

822
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,200
Let me go.

823
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Have a map of home.

824
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Have a map of here.

825
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,700
Save a bunch of money.

826
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Get the ones that visit me.

827
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:41,180
Remember, where we just belong.

828
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:46,180
Well, that's love

829
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,180
No one's from this world

830
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,180
Down along those lands

831
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,180
She wants the whole band up after me

832
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,180
And she won't be coming back

833
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,180
Well, that's love

834
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
Well, would you be right now?

835
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:15,180
Never go to the base, I'm vomiting, vomiting, vomiting, vomiting

836
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,180
And I'll teach you, let's start rockin' it, rockin' it, rockin' it, rockin' it

837
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:26,180
Oh, baby, where am I? Where will you be right now?

838
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,180
Tears, and they wanna get the hype up

839
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,180
A couple of MC rocks on the mic, yeah

840
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,180
And here we go, everybody on the line

841
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,180
Ooh, fine, ooh, fine, ooh, ooh, ooh

842
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,180
Well, we're in a low differential

843
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,180
And the sun goes down to green

844
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,180
And this one pushes my mind

845
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,180
Cause I know they're running me

846
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,180
But my love

847
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

848
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,180
Well, won't you be right now?

849
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,180
Not at night now

850
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:54,180
But my love

851
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:45,180
Whoa, hello. Sorry gang, that's a bad MP3, so we're gonna just go right into the next song. Sorry about that.

852
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:29,180
The beat is real Swiss, it's Cuban, barbers here, put it in gear, lean your head, cause the beat is real funky, head

853
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,180
Let's rock and roll with soul, I hold the mic, I go cause barbers in full control

854
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,180
Man, take the game to fame, I'm what I seek for rhyme for rhyme for rhyme, I'll be back later

855
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:44,180
She's a sexy nigga, she's a ballin' up, she's a ballin' up

856
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:51,180
She's a sexy nigga, she's a ballin' up, she's a ballin' up

857
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:46,100
He knew he had to try to let love in Not to let her know, she was in the mood for

858
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,100
So he began to play the game

859
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

860
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:57,100
How he was hoping she was not the same

861
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,100
Who's to see the kind of lady that I'm seeking

862
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,100
After all of this time, could this be true love

863
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,100
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

864
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,100
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

865
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,100
I like to live where I'm a fine lady

866
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:17,100
You've been hard to see so why I am the cure

867
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,100
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

868
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,100
The best day boy you know you can count on me

869
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,100
Believe me, there's a lady

870
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,100
You know what she found in me

871
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,100
Is a lady kind of lady

872
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
That can give you what you need

873
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,100
Baby, I find ladies that will never leave you lonely

874
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,100
And maybe there's a lady

875
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,100
Ladies, find a lady, sign me up, I won't be late

876
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,100
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

877
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:12,100
We were just talking about Sakbamani hosts another fabulous tournament, also known as Shept, which is going to happen this Saturday.

878
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
It's pretty soon already now.

879
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,100
Yeah, I know, I can't believe it's already here. Crazy shit.

880
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,100
We also talked previously in the show about DDR Max USA.

881
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:31,100
Rumor is now, I don't know how true this is or not, this is kind of one of those rumors, but maybe you guys have thoughts on this, that Max 2 has already been announced for the US.

882
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:35,100
What do you guys think? Do you think that's actually possible that it could have already happened or what do you think is going on?

883
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,100
Nope, it hasn't been announced yet as far as I'm concerned.

884
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:44,100
All that they did was, Max 2 has been announced for the Japanese system, so we know that for a fact.

885
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:50,100
And now where people are getting their information is from gamefacts.com and they said that it's been announced.

886
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,100
To be honest, I don't think it's credible at all.

887
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:58,100
I think, yeah, there probably will be one. No, it hasn't been announced.

888
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,140
You think maybe somebody's getting confused with the earlier announcement that Max 2 is

889
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,140
coming out in Japan?

890
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,020
No, because they had both listed for Japanese and U.S. systems.

891
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,020
Interesting.

892
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,020
But who cares?

893
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,500
I mean, if it comes out, it comes out.

894
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Cool.

895
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Get burned out.

896
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Fucking make onis.

897
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,500
Dude, those...

898
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,500
You know what?

899
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,500
I'm feeling the angst in this room.

900
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
Yes.

901
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,500
I'm thinking it's about time.

902
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,500
What?

903
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,500
We're going to do some FUs?

904
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,500
Oh yeah.

905
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Alright, let's do some FUs.

906
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,500
We're going to get into the FUs of the week.

907
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:36,180
the part where Jamie likes to go off and F something. No. I had to go off and say, fuck

908
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:42,060
them. Fuck them right in their nose, because their ear and their ass aren't good enough.

909
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,460
Alright, and if you want to send your F-us of the week, just send them to me over in

910
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,560
the chat room. You can PM me over in the chat room, and we already had some people do that,

911
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,620
or you can alternatively send us an email, but you've got to do it right now, because

912
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:57,140
we only do the segment for a little bit orange lounge radio that's all one word

913
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:03,540
at yahoo.com here we go all right my first one of the week

914
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:09,060
um well there's the flies the flies dead there's the asshole with his uh horn and

915
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:13,860
i hope he dies um i said what mine was going to be in the car didn't i

916
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:18,020
on the way over here uh license plate yes okay

917
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,380
dan comes home last night proceeds to tell me that our license tag

918
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,660
our license plate is missing off of our car it's nowhere to be found in the

919
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:33,260
parking lot and the whole plate around the license plate is missing so we're

920
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,580
thinking it's either been stolen or has just fallen off although it's kind of

921
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:40,420
funny that two screws would fall off at once so this actually might be the

922
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:44,660
weakest in you know for my man's benefit but he has to spend however many hours

923
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:50,740
the DMV tomorrow to get that replaced my poor sweetheart I'm gonna hear about it

924
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,580
about tomorrow to you

925
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,920
that's the worst part i have to have your hands at work

926
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,240
and then go to the dmv

927
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,160
and they come back and work

928
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,360
oh my god

929
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:08,880
there's some days that we don't let my move at all

930
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,500
uh...

931
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,640
and that effectively

932
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,700
goes to

933
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,660
this cold it seems to be refusing to leave me

934
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,440
and that

935
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,360
that's the end of it and then

936
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,520
all I want to do is sleep. I'm taking a nap. Anyway, um, but yeah. You know, they're not

937
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,520
very big, powerful, evil fuck yous, but they are, so fuck you. All of those things. Yeah,

938
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,080
whatever. But, you know, thank you for pizza.

939
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,960
Is that all your FUs of the Week?

940
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,960
Mm-hmm. This is fucked up.

941
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,960
Okay. Let's hear from Loki. You got any FUs of the Week?

942
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
I have a new song.

943
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,960
Yes, you do. And yes, I called this actually before the show, so for people that were recommending

944
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:52,960
recommend during the show. I beat you to it. Well, first nephew of the week goes to Konami

945
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:03,620
and DDR Max USA. I hate Oni's. Yes, people like Oni's. I don't like Oni's. I don't like

946
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:09,360
the fact I have to play Oni's to unlock songs. That sucks. You don't have to. Oh yeah, I'll

947
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,340
just play the game for months on end. Oh, fuck that. I got other games that came out

948
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:18,340
the same way, like Grand Theft Auto Vice City, they're beckoning my attention, and not playing

949
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,180
this stupid game constantly. I've double-a'd almost everything on Heavy. I don't need to

950
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,380
fucking double-a everything in this whole game and still be playing, and songs are still

951
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,980
not unlocked. It's fucked up. Dave just beat, you know, the home base, you know, of course,

952
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,780
and the new hardcore 21 still hasn't been unlocked, so I guess I gotta play some more

953
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,060
songs. Oh, really? It didn't unlock hardcore? No, it didn't unlock that at all, so I guess

954
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:46,880
I got to play about 500 more songs before that fucking thing gets undone, but you got to see the drop the bomb remix finally

955
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,180
Yes, let me add that the drop the bomb remix while the song is cool

956
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,700
The steps suck ass and the backgrounds they took no time whatsoever to make that background

957
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,700
They're like, let's take the old drop the bomb background and put system

958
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,300
SF remix on there whoop-de-doo. So that's my complaint

959
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:12,300
Remember Brilliant To You, when they put out the orchestra groove, they just made it in pink.

960
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:41,500
enough to actually play a 40-minute oni on a homepad.

961
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,100
You'd probably have to go through a couple of homepads while playing. It's like you'd burn out a whole new one

962
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,460
just from playing that game.

963
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,740
I would feel bad for anybody trying to do that, like not on a controller or

964
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,740
whatever.

965
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:55,020
And even on a controller, your frickin' hands are gonna cramp up too.

966
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,120
So, you know, F Konami for their...

967
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,900
I mean, I like the fact that they put onis in there. That's cool.

968
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:05,820
But what the hell are you thinking putting 21-song onis and 17-song onis? That's just ridiculous.

969
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,820
That's like my 100-minute-long oni.

970
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,820
Okay.

971
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,820
Oh, does Dave have an FU?

972
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,820
A little bit.

973
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,820
Okay, this is better.

974
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:22,820
So, my FU also goes to Max USA, even though I've just played it, like, half an hour ago.

975
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,820
Also towards the onis, but for different reasons.

976
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,820
I like them, but damn, I've got, like, carpool tunnel now.

977
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,820
Seriously.

978
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:35,820
And it's not just that, it's the fact that the backgrounds are really bright and really flashy.

979
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,820
And so my eyes are really slow.

980
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,820
You can turn that down in the options screen, you know.

981
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:43,820
I didn't know that after like three minutes, and I'm not going to go start over again.

982
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:48,820
Because, you know, to start over I have to play all the other songs again, I'm not going to do that shit.

983
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:53,820
So, F.U., Oni, on Mac USA.

984
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,820
Alright.

985
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,820
And how do you, how do you unlock Hardcore 21?

986
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,820
Uh, you have to basically give head to, uh, DDR Max USA.

987
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,820
That'll be hard.

988
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,820
Alright.

989
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,820
Especially since it doesn't have either.

990
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,820
Uh, my FUs of the Week.

991
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,820
I have, I have a few, I guess.

992
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,820
Uh, my first FU of the Week goes to Jamie.

993
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,820
What?

994
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,820
For getting me addicted to Animal Crossing.

995
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,820
You bitch.

996
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,820
Now I have to go spend money on a GameCube.

997
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,820
Just so I can have those annoying little assholes move into my neighborhood.

998
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:29,820
Rob lives in my neighborhood.

999
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,820
And an F you to Belle the cow. You bitch, I hate you.

1000
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,820
What did Belle do to you? Belle's the nice one, Petunia's the bitch.

1001
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,820
Yeah, an F you to Petunia. She sucks too.

1002
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,820
And an F you to Mallory because she won't move out of our town.

1003
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,820
However, Rob sent me fruit.

1004
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:45,820
Yes, I mailed...

1005
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,820
He sent me an apple.

1006
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,820
I mailed Jamie some fruit and I mailed Dan some fruit.

1007
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,820
What you got?

1008
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,820
Dan sent you clothes.

1009
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:58,160
close. Yes, Dan sent me close. I sent you rags. So, F. Jamie, for getting me hooked

1010
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:05,060
on that crack rock. My other F.U. goes to Psychos. Psychos online that want me to do

1011
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:11,280
dirty things on my webcam. You suck. Go away. I don't like you. Stop messaging me. Stop

1012
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:20,280
mailing me. It's sad. F.U. to stalkers. Now, there's a difference between showing a little

1013
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,280
We like attention, but stalking? No. Stop stalking, please. Sad.

1014
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:28,280
I hate when I get runs in my stalkers.

1015
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:32,280
I think that's all my FUs. I don't think I really have anything else.

1016
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,280
Maybe I'll think of something later. Oh, FU to myself for sleeping

1017
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,280
through half of Halloween. And FU

1018
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,280
just like last week, FU to all my friends

1019
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,280
who get drunk while I have to drive. FU. I hate you.

1020
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,280
Chat room FUs.

1021
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,160
yes they do

1022
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,400
via ps2

1023
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,840
uh... who else has nephew let's see

1024
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,180
black lap says all this is a good one now if you if you hang out in the chat

1025
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,360
room during the week

1026
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,700
in channel pound orange lounge during the week

1027
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,920
you've been hearing uh... about the black lap saga with his roommate

1028
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,440
after his roommate and his now girlfriend for once again getting naughty

1029
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,780
while he was in the room

1030
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,480
they went a bit further this time because moaning was hurting even over

1031
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,520
his headphones and they ignored him when he he threw a bottle at them to get them

1032
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,600
to stop. Yes, that was my suggestion last night in the chatroom, to throw a bottle or

1033
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,460
poke him with the stick. I was going for more of the poking with the stick. Next time, set

1034
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:02,100
them on fire. See if they notice. He says, F everything that contributed to his inability

1035
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,920
to go to Shaft this Saturday. Instead, he will be paintballing for his birthday and

1036
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,800
he will not be able to listen to the broadcast. Well, that's your choice, buddy. Fuck his

01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,320
You know what sucks worse than that?

1044
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,320
Go back to my music for a minute.

1045
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,320
Oh, okay, yes.

1046
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:53,320
Having the flu and PMS at the same time, that sucks more than anything has sucked before.

1047
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,320
La la la la la la la.

1048
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,320
Hey, this is the DJ.

01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320

01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
Mine topped.

uh... fuck you to me for a consistently changing names in the chat room because

1062
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,560
but that's because i'm not at home

1063

1065
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,920
She says, uh, fuck you to people who bring their babies to the 11pm showing of the movie The Ring last night.

1066
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,920
You're hurting your child's ears as well as pissing off everyone who wants to enjoy the movie. Thank you.

1067
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
Oh, I have something along those lines too.

1068
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,920
Yes.

1069
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Where's my music?

1070
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,920
You and your music.

1071
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,420

1080
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,900

1083
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,540
this little kid makes a mess you know little kids make messes

1084
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,900
this woman comes up and her mom comes up and goes

1085
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:39,180
oh my god what are you doing in the middle of the damn restaurant oh my god

1086
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,220
and dan and i look over

1087
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:45,300
and this woman's going off on this girl that can't be more than six years old

1088
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,840
this kid starts bawling

1089
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,080
and was like you clean that up you clean that up

1090
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,100
and the girl goes like i don't wanna

1091
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,820
right in the middle of the damn thing

1092
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:58,240
And finally the woman just takes her out of there, but we're like going and the thing is is that you know

1093
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,440
Who Dan and I are blaming for it is not the little girl

1094
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:06,220
We're planning her mom for being such a bitch. So fuck you whoever you were woman. She didn't look like a bitch, too

1095
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:10,480
Oh my god. Anyway, isn't that weird when like people just look like a bitch like you can just tell

1096
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,820
People should not breathe. Okay

1097
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,580
Can I get back to the chatroom if you sound okay, please

1098
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:23,580
We have another new person here. Hello to you. It's EOSFVB.

1099
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:27,580
I guess that's some kind of acronym. I don't know though.

1100
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:31,580
He says, fuck you to AMD for making a 2.7 gigahertz.

1101
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:36,580
When I get it, it's going to have this huge heat sink and fan, which is going to make a lot of noise, making him crazy.

1102
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:40,580
And also will exhaust a lot of heat, which will fuck over the whole global warming thing.

1103
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,580
Someone who's thinking in the big picture. I like that.

1104
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:46,580
I like the heat. You know, it keeps my room nice and warm in the winter.

1105
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,580
You know, I just have to keep my door shut and leave the mirror on.

1106
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,580
Hi, you live in California. What happens in the summer?

1107
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580
Don't run the heater.

1108
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,580
I don't really have a choice. Everyone else gets a cold.

1109
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,580
I don't get cold. They do.

1110
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
All right.

1111
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:07,580
23rd Magus says, he has a little F.U. to whoever thought that what they were doing was more important than going to Scandi on Halloween.

1112
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,580
I have a big F.U. to shitty drivers and being poor.

1113
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,580
I also have an F.U. to conundrum 1 for hating DDR. Fuck you, Biatch.

1114
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,580
No fighting, no fighting, don't hate, don't hate.

1115
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:21,580
On Halloween, Dan and I were taking his dad out to dinner for his birthday, so that was more important.

1116
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:25,580
And I was watching Friends. Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

1117
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,580
Hey, we were at Red Lobster.

1118
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,580
Hey, IT votes Survivor, okay? I didn't get to watch Survivor till the next day.

1119
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:35,580
And I'm pissed. Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

1120
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,580
Fuck you to Suu Kyi for voting out Xian. Fuck you.

1121
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,580
That's all I have to say.

1122
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,500
and that means nothing to the rest of us

1123
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:51,500
JB says uh... F you to the little kid at RVGL who likes to grab asses

1124
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,820
alright, let's leave it at that

1125
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,260
uh... Joe Mama

1126
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,980
I think this is a good one to end on, this is the last one, he says

1127
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,380
my fuck you is to school because it sucks

1128
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,700
indeed

1129
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:10,380
that's why I don't go

1130
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,220
for those that don't know i uh... graduate high school several years i wish

1131
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,300
you were that simple and i'm too old

1132
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,140
and he wants to be here if you do the fact that they go to work tomorrow

1133
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,100
have had a whole week off

1134
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,220
yeah if you to work tomorrow because we cannot actually want to go tomorrow

1135
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:30,100
i had friday off of so nicely sleep until eleven

1136
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:35,640
uh... so i think i was most of my local like nine and what's left

1137
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,340
now that we've gotten this like he's out of the way all i can check the mail

1138
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,180
let's see if we got any over email. I have to give them the courtesy because not everybody

1139
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:47,180
loads the chat room. Nope, no FUs over mail. So fuck you to the listeners for not emailing

1140
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:53,180
us. No, I'm just kidding. We love listeners. We love you. We love you. We love you. We

1141
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:58,500
love big stickies that leash you. No, wait. What? I don't know. I couldn't think of anything

1142
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:04,900
that rhymed. I brought up in one of the FUs, Survivor, a popular program on CBS. Speaking

1143
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:11,100
of CBS, segue segue, we have the early show finally happening tomorrow from what we're

1144
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,740
being told. It's been delayed not once, but twice now. It was supposed to happen on Halloween

1145
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:20,100
and I had the whole TVO set up to tape it and lo and behold, it didn't even happen because

1146
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,720
I guess it rained or something so they couldn't do it. The early show is like CBS's answer

1147
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,680
to today, you know the today show? Isn't it like a brand new show? You know Good Morning

1148
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,680
America?

1149
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
Okay.

1150
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,240
It's like, you know, the early news show.

1151
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,180
And actually, yes, you're right, Loki.

1152
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,920
They just re-tailored the show recently.

1153
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,620
They got rid of Brian, well, Brian Gumbel quit, I think, and the other chick got let

1154
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:45,340
go and they have like a panel, they're, well, I don't know what the hell, but they're turning

1155
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,340
it into The View.

1156
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,460
It's basically, now it's The Early Show, but it's The View, but with men also.

1157
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:55,140
And by the way, for our listeners who are unfamiliar with my habits of watching TV,

1158
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,140
I don't.

1159
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,140
Okay.

1160
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,540
Just thought I'd clarify that for you.

1161
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:03,720
So if somebody brings up a show to me, I'm usually going to go, what's that?

1162
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,000
Or a commercial, I'm going to go, what's that?

1163
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,080
The only thing I keep up with is Buffy.

1164
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,160
And I haven't watched Buffy since the season started.

1165
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,680
But I have to watch Buffy because I need to see James Marsters Naked, okay?

1166
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,680
Hello.

1167
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,680
I need Spike.

1168
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,760
Anyway, CBS early show.

1169
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,160
It's been delayed but I guess it's finally going to happen Monday, so if you guys are

1170
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,120
up early tomorrow you should watch this provided it doesn't get delayed again

1171
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,720
perhaps I should check some of the big news sites and make sure it didn't get

1172
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:37,040
delayed again but I guess there's going to be some folks just out there playing

1173
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,600
DDR I'm not sure what they're gonna do I don't know what arcade machine they're

1174
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,920
gonna be playing or anything but it's gonna be nationwide exposure to DDR so a

1175
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,920
bunch of old ladies who get up early in the morning and watch the early show

1176
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,400
will be exposed to DDR won't that be special maybe Julie channel do some

1177
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,920
interviews that'll be exciting wow that was intense that was the best dance

1178
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:06,840
do it Julie Chen should be the announcer in DDR stream Julie Chen you did you

1179
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,800
said you did watch one episode of Big Brother right once okay Julie Chen was

1180
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,400
the host of Big Brother oh she was cool and she's also on the early show so

1181
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,080
that's why I'm like she should do the interview so this never staying up all

1182
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,080
I might.

1183
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Oops, I did it again on MTV!

1184
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,080
Bomani on TV, wow!

1185
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,080
You know what MTV needs to play?

1186
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,080
The Hot Limit video.

1187
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,080
Oh my god, that video is so much ass!

1188
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:10,080
You know what, you know what, we need to set aside the little bit of space and put the Hot Limit video up on the site.

1189
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:15,080
I think at some point we're going to need to, because that video is like the fruitiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

1190
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:20,080
I'm dancing on a star, I'm dancing on a star, I'm dancing on a star!

1191
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,080
Actually, you can watch it on the Come.2 Music channel.

1192
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,080
Oh, is it Come.2 slash ID Music?

1193
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,080
That's C-O-M-E, by the way.

1194
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,080
Yeah, you can watch it there.

1195
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,080
Just go under the video section.

1196
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,080
It's TM Revolution, hot minute.

1197
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,080
Hot limit, sorry.

1198
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:52,080
Oh, I think I got one more F.U. coming in. It's for somebody that I like, Vandalous, and he'll have to P.M. that to me, so send that over and I'll get that F.U. in there before we go to another segment.

1199
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:57,080
Moving along, would you like to do a sim update?

1200
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:00,080
Actually, I do have one cool thing that I'd like to bring up.

1201
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:09,080
While we're bringing up fuck yous and kudos and things like that, I have to say that I got to see a preview of the Metal Gear Solid 2 substance video.

1202
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,080
I mean commercial that's going to be airing.

1203
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,080
Oh my God, that's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

1204
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,080
What do they do with it?

1205
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,080
It's like a guy in his office, sitting at his desk all of a sudden,

1206
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,080
you hear his boss,

1207
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,080
Where's that report?

1208
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
He goes,

1209
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,080
and then you hear the Metal Gear Solid sneaky music,

1210
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,080
and he's sneaking along the hall,

1211
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,080
and his boss is rampaging,

1212
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,080
his boss looks by,

1213
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,080
and you see this box walks across the office.

1214
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,080
Does it do the exclamation point thing?

1215
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,080
The boss goes into his office,

1216
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,080
and the report is there,

1217
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
and he picks it up,

1218
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,640
For one of the other Metal Gear games, I don't remember if it was Metal Gear Solid.

1219
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:16,640
He's just going, I don't know. I don't know! The G.A.C.T. commercial was so funny.

1220
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,560
I'll make that available somehow. I'll make that available.

1221
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,680
G.A.C.T. is the hottest woman. I just have to say, while we're on the topic

1222
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,400
of commercials, the one with Donald Trump and Grimace owns for McDonald's.

1223
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,600
Okay, I'm clueless. I know, I'm clueless too. I don't watch enough

1224
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,760
TV. Ever since I got TiVo, I fast-forward through

1225
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,440
commercials. I'm a whore for Tivo. That shit is awesome.

1226
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:43,320
Did you know, I have this theory, and I posted this on DDR for you a while back, that the

1227
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:49,600
McDonaldland characters represent different factions of the franchise. Ronald represents

1228
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:58,440
the company itself, the all-encompassing whole. You have the early bird, who represents breakfast.

1229
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:03,680
You have the fry guys, who represent the fries. You've got, you know, Mayor McCheese, who's

1230
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:08,760
the cheeseburger and Big Mac, the cop, and the hamburglar.

1231
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:14,880
You're not like Ronald isn't the crazy psycho who likes to lure children into his play lands.

1232
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:23,880
But you know what? Dan and I have been trying to think of what the grimace representative

1233
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:30,520
we finally realized it. This is what McDonald's wants its consumers to be. Big purple blobby

1234
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
things.

1235
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,960
Is this like trying to compare the Wizard of Oz to the Dust Bowl, that whole thing in

1236
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,960
history class?

1237
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,960
Is that where you're going with this?

1238
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,960
Well, kind of, but no.

1239
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,360
The other thing is that, you know, the McDonald's franchise wants us all to be dim-witted, slow

1240
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,160
and fat, and live off of their food, where, you know what my impression of the Grimace

1241
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,160
is?

1242
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,440
That's the expression you make after eating there.

1243
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,740
No, but like, it's Donald Trump and Grimace.

1244
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,040
You can't get a better couple.

1245
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,960
I mean, that's too cool.

1246
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:58,960
Donald Trump.

1247
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,960
Maybe Ivana and Grimace.

1248
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,960
And Grimace.

1249
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,640
this is what you get after eating a Taco Bell. I'm making a gift!

1250
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,040
I got Vandalous's F.U. and since we like Vandalous, we'll let him in a little late because we

1251
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,600
didn't get it before. Vandalous says F.U. to politicians for filling his mailbox the

1252
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:21,240
past week with snail mail spam.

1253
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:26,520
And for all those stupid fucking poster things that are out there. I swear to God, there's

1254
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,840
Oh God, it's like being in high school and seeing all the posters around campus, you

1255
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,840
know.

1256
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,840
And it's like, hello people!

1257
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,640
No, Jamie, for class president, she rocks!

1258
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:40,240
It's not the number of posters that wins you the votes.

1259
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,240
Get a clue.

1260
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,520
Oh, is your vote going to be based on something different there, Dave?

1261
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,160
Yeah, I'm going to go around and tabulate how many posters are up, and then I'll vote

1262
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,680
for the person who spent the most time putting them all up.

1263
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,440
Thank God you're not 18 and can't vote.

1264
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,840
You know what, I remember how that was in high school.

1265
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,520
And one year I put up a poster that says, vote for me because I wasn't nominated.

1266
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,440
I have a late response to your commercial about the Metal Gear Solid commercial from

1267
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,920
23rd Magus show like this.

1268
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,640
The truck have started to move.

1269
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,640
Yes!

1270
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,520
Oh my god, I love that.

1271
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,400
Oh no, the truck have started to move.

1272
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,300
All right, we're going to take a really quick break.

1273
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,680
We're going to come back, and we're

1274
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,580
going to do a listless segment, everybody's favorite.

1275
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,780
And now you can participate through email as well,

1276
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,500
but we like it if you're in the chat room.

1277
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,260
Go ahead and join the chat room, any other side IRC server.

1278
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:40,500
You can join IRC.acheads.org is your server.

1279
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,580
And you can join karma.othersideirc.net.

1280
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:47,180
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge

1281
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,460
is what you're going to join.

1282
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:54,940
And tonight, the list list is going to be a little bit different.

1283
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:59,140
We decided we're selling out this week since Max USA just came out, and we're going to

1284
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,420
pretty much suck Konami's dick tonight.

1285
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,420
And what we're going to do...

1286
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:08,380
The views expressed by Rob, or not necessarily those views expressed by...

1287
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,380
Yeah, whatever.

1288
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:17,940
Uh, pretty much tonight what we're doing, we're doing Best Konami Game, not Bomani.

1289
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:22,000
So BES cannot be a game that wasn't Balmaini, we're going to school, or we're possibly going

1290
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
to school.

1291
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,720
It could be arcade games, it could be damn near anything, so stay tuned, we'll be right

1292
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,720
back.

1293
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,560
We're going to start this off, we're going to have some old school Beatmania song, and

1294
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,000
a really old school DDR song in this mix, we're going to start it off with one more

1295
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,400
new school Max USA track.

1296
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:48,400
This is Do It Right, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1297
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,400
And it's you and me to be alright

1298
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,400
So let's do your best and see

1299
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,400
You're all that you want

1300
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,400
We'll reach a member and a star tonight

1301
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Come on and let it rest

1302
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,400
And you will never fall

1303
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,400
Believe me

1304
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,400
You're still the same

1305
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,400
Nobody wants to reach back

1306
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,400
Let it go, let it go

1307
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,400
You're leaving in your sight

1308
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,400
And we're all kinda done

1309
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,400
You're looking back now

1310
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,400
Is it alright for you or for you?

1311
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,400
What do you see when you're acting like it's an action scene?

1312
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,400
What do you see when we keep it right?

1313
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,400
It's the kind of battle that stands in the lunch room, don't you see his life?

1314
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,400
Even if you don't know, he's a man for you

1315
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,400
He's just like you, yes he's strong

1316
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
He's the one, tell you what

1317
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,400
So much more to do, get into the world

1318
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,400
Well you can knock him off, and take no more

1319
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,400
It's the one that can do, so take it easy now

1320
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,400
I can show you how

1321
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:13,400
So still we're love inside, but the rumors say call us to love and light, yeah

1322
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,000
I'm so hypnotized to know the fours and the loosens

1323
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,300
Like magicians, he draws a rabbit out with a hat, son

1324
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,900
I'm doing more like a 44th magnet, MC3's time for collision

1325
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,900
They try to imagine us traveling the street of length

1326
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,600
But everything's supposed to be frightening

1327
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,500
Plus the thought you alone be down in the dimension

1328
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,400
Call the Twilight Zone, you're terrified

1329
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,400
Plus you can't bear the blood you and I want to want

1330
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,300
In the land of the lost, we love to sip

1331
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,100
Finish me, my friend, you'll wake up ugly

1332
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,400
Because you're dreaming again, but next time I'm on scene

1333
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,200
Let's try to distance, keep your mouth so soft and dark

1334
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,200
Because I'm trippin' dizzy

1335
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,400
I'm hot and shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot

1336
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:22,400
I like to move it, move it, move it

1337
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,400
All girls all over the world

1338
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,400
Original man, stunt man for your case man

1339
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:31,400
I love how all girls move their body

1340
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:46,600
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1341
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,880
is brought to you by the letters B, letter A, and the number D9.

1342
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,320
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1343
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,120
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio!

1344
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,120
Hi ho!

1345
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:06,120
And as promised, here we go with tonight's List List segment. Yay!

1346
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:14,120
This particular List List is non-beinami konami games.

1347
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,120
That's right.

1348
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:23,120
Whether it be stuff that's been in the arcade, whether it's been in America, whether it was only released in Japan, whether it's super obscure, we're talking about them.

1349
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,120
Oh God, I love you! We can press your luck.

1350
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,120
No whammies, no whammies, stop!

1351
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,960
or as new school as you want. Dave, your number three choice for best konami, not a bamanigame.

1352
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,120
Okay, my number three choice is an arcade game, uh, Police 9-1-1-2.

1353
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:14,520
Because that game is cool, and it kind of defeats the purpose of having the game being called 9-1-1-2.

1354
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,120
The police!

1355
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:21,520
If you think about it, the Japanese name was, um, Keisatsu-kan, so, it makes sense.

1356
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,020
Yeah! Okay, yeah!

1357
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:27,120
Yes.

1358
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,960
Logie, what's your number three choice for Konami thing?

1359
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,400
Alright, um, totally old school arcade game here.

1360
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:41,400
It's the Ninja Turtles arcade game. Ninja Turtles. Oh yeah.

1361
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:48,400
I used to plug so many quarters in that machine.

1362
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,760
I remember one night being at the arcade.

1363
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,320
This is, by the way, the same day my brother got hit by a car and was in the hospital.

1364
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,320
but anyway these guys paid me to play as Leonardo and we got to the end of the

1365
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,780
game we had

1366
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,020
freaking uh...

1367
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,480
Craig I can't moving crane

1368
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,720
we had we had shredder beaten in

1369
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,700
the other guy

1370
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,720
and then they turned off the machines

1371
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,900
and let's get a look at it

1372
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,520
bitches

1373
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,320
the only

1374
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:16,520
multiplayer game that I like more than uh... the Ninja Turtles was the x-men

1375
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,360
six-player game that came on

1376
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,000
I don't think that was Konami though

1377
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I don't think it was Grody.

1378
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Well, um, sorry.

1379
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Anyway, my, um, number three...

1380
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Jimmy's number three!

1381
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,680
And by the way, I've picked games that I own because I'm cool.

1382
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:32,520
I almost said Grodius II, because everybody knows how much I love Grodius II.

1383
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,520
Burning Heat?

1384
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,520
Yeah.

1385
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:39,560
Well, instead what I picked for my number three was Kid Dracula on Game Boy, where you

1386
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,560
play as Super TV Alucard.

1387
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,560
Damn!

1388
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,560
Damn, that's old school!

1389
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,560
I...

1390
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,560
And you know, the thing is, is like, if you look on yield fund colland lists, you know

1391
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,560
when they used to have the prices on those pages like that. The game is a $30 game, even

1392
01:35:53,560 --> 01:36:01,560
used. So, it's really hard to find. If anyone can find the game, you can get Moms, though,

1393
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:07,560
for the Famicon. It's the Famicon Mom, online. If no one's ever played it, check it out.

1394
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,560
It's hilarious.

1395
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:14,560
Alright. My number three pick is Castlevania II, Simon's Quest. That game was the shit.

1396
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:15,560
Winner.

1397
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,560
I like three better.

1398
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,560
Fuck you if you don't like that game.

1399
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,560
Three was better.

1400
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,560
Two was the bomb.

1401
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:26,560
Because they completely fucked up the first one in the best ways possible.

1402
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,560
And the music owned and everything.

1403
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,560
So, Castlevania 2 it is.

1404
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,560
Dave, your number two pick.

1405
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,560
My number two pick is Gradius, the original.

1406
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,560
This is cool.

1407
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,560
From newest of school to oldest of school, Gradius for what, Nintendo, Arcade?

1408
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,560
No arcade. It doesn't matter. I'm not putting systems down. We'll just put Gradius.

1409
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:51,560
Arcade. I don't know. I guess arcade.

1410
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,560
The reason why I'm specifying systems on mine is because a couple games on here did have variations from system to system.

1411
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,560
Eh, we'll be okay, I guess.

1412
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,560
I guess arcade is sad enough.

1413
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,560
All right. So is there any particular reason, Gradius?

1414
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,560
It's cool.

1415
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,560
All right, cool.

1416
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,560
Loki, number two?

1417
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:17,560
Alright, number two, um, I'm gonna have to go with, uh, Dracula X.

1418
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:24,440
Ah, Dracula X, which one, the, the one that they put in, on, on what, TurboGrafx, or what,

1419
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,520
which one, which one, the number, Castlevania V, or what?

1420
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,040
I don't know, it's on PlayStation, I know that.

1421
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,640
Alright, okay, that'll work.

1422
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,640
Dracula X, okay.

1423
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,640
Well...

1424
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:40,640
No, that was my number one.

1425
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,640
Well, that's okay, we have a duplicate, so what?

1426
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,640
Oh, oh, Logie's gonna change it? Okay.

1427
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,640
What's that then?

1428
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,640
We'll just go with Metal Gear Solid.

1429
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:53,640
Metal Gear Solid, okay.

1430
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:58,640
Switching gears and putting Metal Gear Solid.

1431
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,640
Jamie, you're number two big.

1432
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,640
Number two, Sexy Parodius for Saturn.

1433
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,640
Yes.

1434
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,460
sexy proteus

1435
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:10,160
i think let's just say it was a very pretty as the sex prettiest

1436
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,880
kicks its ass cuz you can please

1437
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,440
windy and twin b

1438
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,160
and the guys on paper airplane and uh...

1439
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,800
the little benny girls riding the rockets

1440
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,300
the game is so cool

1441
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,780
and what other game

1442
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:26,000
can you totally destroy a las vegas showgirl and

1443
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,120
uh... a pirate ship with the kitty cat face on it

1444
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:32,500
uh... i see in the chat room i see guardian legend being mentioned we

1445
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:38,400
should point out that was made by Irem. That's made by Irem Broderbund, released by Broderbund.

1446
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,200
Who were the same people that made Lode Runner, and if you remember Lode Runner, you're cool.

1447
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:49,820
My number two pick is Life Force. Life Force is awesome. Salamander series. The honky version

1448
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:54,100
of Gradius II. Well, it wasn't really Gradius II, it was Salamander. Life Force was Salamander.

1449
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,540
But they called it Gradius II here, in America at least, didn't they? No. They kind of referred

1450
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,900
to it. I remember they kind of... The reason why I know this is because I found my Nintendo

1451
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,300
the cartridge of it last night.

1452
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:09,300
For my number one pick, I had Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1453
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,940
Ah, good pick. I think that would have been on my list if I didn't already know you were

1454
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,940
picking that.

1455
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,660
Yeah, I had trouble coming up with some Konami games. But I just really love that game and

1456
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:26,300
the music it's owned. And the fact that you can play as Alucard and I think Richter and

1457
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,940
the girl. I forget.

1458
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:32,940
You can only play as Maria on the Saturn version, and the Saturn version had two extra levels.

1459
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,940
You can play as Maria after you...

1460
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:37,940
Well, that was a rumor, I think. I don't think it ever really was possible.

1461
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:42,940
The thing about it is that Maria was supposed to be playable on the original, plus they had the other two levels done.

1462
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:46,940
If you notice, there's a little trick you can do when you first run into the corridor.

1463
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:54,940
If you go back to that first corridor and stomp on this trap door, you can go down the trap door to a save room.

1464
01:39:54,940 --> 01:40:00,940
But that save room leads to the underground garden on the Saturn version.

1465
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:03,940
So, a little bit of trivia.

1466
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:04,940
Okay.

1467
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,940
Strider is Capcom, we should point out.

1468
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:13,940
Frogger is Konami game, but I think somebody else put it out and then Konami distributed it.

1469
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:14,940
I'm not sure.

1470
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,940
It's Atari? You sure?

1471
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:17,940
It's Atari.

1472
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:18,940
Alright.

1473
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:19,940
Anyway.

1474
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:21,940
I just warned that Konami distributed a version of it.

1475
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:23,940
Maybe they were just the distributors of it or something.

1476
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,620
something i don't know anyway who cares you wait out that showed up on the list

1477
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,580
of my uh... again all right you know what

1478
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:32,940
uh... lucky you're number one

1479
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,980
foreign but uh...

1480
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,400
i met the contract

1481
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:40,500
uh... let's go with contras shattered soldier because that's a brand new one

1482
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,240
and

1483
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,260
it's everything conscious should be

1484
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,620
except very very very very hard but i guess part was supposed to be very very

1485
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,300
very very very very

1486
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:53,940
Alright, yeah, if you didn't do the up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start, then you were fucked anyway.

1487
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,740
Alright.

1488
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:58,460
Well, we already know, but explain it again, okay?

1489
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:02,700
My number one is Dracula X Wando of Blood for the PC Engine Duo.

1490
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,420
Game was not released in America. By the way, for all of you who own the Super Nintendo version,

1491
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,740
I feel so sorry for you because it's totally butchered.

1492
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,500
Um...

1493
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,340
Dracula X Wando of Blood

1494
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:14,620
has the best music ever.

1495
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,320
The best levels ever. This is like...

1496
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:24,720
And I actually, my friend had to pay Dan and I back for an anime expo, so when she was

1497
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:31,360
in Japan she picked this up for us, for ten thousand nine hundred yen.

1498
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:36,120
So it was basically a hundred bucks for this game, and it was worth every penny.

1499
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,720
You can't find it for less than at least two hundred on eBay.

1500
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:39,720
Wow.

1501
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,440
All right, so Drakalex for the PC Engine.

1502
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:48,840
My number one pick, very popular series in Japan, but they didn't do much with it here.

1503
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,380
They released a couple games, I think, but I swear I'm naming the American version of

1504
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,020
this because this is the one I remember playing as a kid.

1505
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,540
This version was the shit.

1506
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:58,920
This game is the shit.

1507
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
It was awesome.

1508
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,180
It had Gradius in it, you might remember, in one little part.

1509
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:05,060
It is the Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

1510
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,060
Go, Emon!

1511
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,060
Cool.

1512
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:11,520
Yeah, that was going to be one of mine, but that game rocks.

1513
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,240
The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was like the best Super Nintendo game they did, maybe

1514
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,400
next to Actraiser, I don't know.

1515
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,960
I do have to offer an honorable mention to a series.

1516
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,800
The Konami World series.

1517
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,120
Konami World, well...

1518
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:28,680
They were released in Japan, on the Famicom.

1519
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:33,600
They were basically, you play as two generic characters who could go to different Konami

1520
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,600
games.

1521
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:38,080
You had a Castlevania world, you had a Gradius world.

1522
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,760
It's like Kingdom Hearts Konami.

1523
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:45,280
yeah it was kind of like that but it's it's pretty it's pretty funny

1524
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:50,120
you know that's also one day probably will have to find the wrong now because

1525
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,960
completely impossible find out what i think i'm

1526
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,100
kona kona all you know i'll be

1527
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:58,960
one of the one of the one of the one on me

1528
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,400
all right

1529
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,600
here's the list that we have so far now we're gonna do the elimination round i

1530
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,520
gotta say

1531
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,340
this could be fucking tough tonight to do the elimination all because all

1532
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,240
these games are really do rule

1533
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,900
This is going to be very difficult.

1534
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:16,340
We have Police 911 Part 2, Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, Kid Dracula, Castlevania II Simon's

1535
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:22,540
Quest, Gradius Arcade, Metal Gear Solid, Sexy Proteus, Life Force slash Salamander, Castlevania

1536
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:28,320
Symphony of the Night, Contra Shattered Soldier, Dracula X the PC Engine version, and the Legend

1537
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,740
of the Mystical Ninja.

1538
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:31,260
Shit, this is hard.

1539
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,780
Okay, but you get to start it off, Dave.

1540
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,380
Which one's coming off the list?

1541
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:42,380
Oh, this is really hard because a third of these games, or half, I've never even played

1542
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:48,440
or heard of because they're really random and I don't know that many odd games.

1543
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:54,660
So I think that I'll take off Castlevania II Simon's Quest because if there is a Castlevania

1544
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:57,800
game it should be Symphony of the Night because that's better.

1545
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:58,800
You're a dick.

1546
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,140
I still live for Castlevania III or Super Castlevania IV.

1547
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:06,340
Anyway, Loki.

1548
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:12,220
I'm just never really a fan of a game where the bullets travel like 20 miles an hour,

1549
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:16,980
so I'm going to have to take off police 9-1-1-2 because bullets are supposed to travel at

1550
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:22,980
bullet speed and not at fly, you know, slow paper airplane speed.

1551
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,580
That's the one I was going to eliminate, damn you.

1552
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:29,500
Did you not mention, did you forget to, like, remember that you're Superman, you're faster

1553
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:33,780
than a speeding bullet. So everything moves like slow motion.

1554
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:38,860
Bullet time. Jamie, your turn.

1555
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:43,220
Life Force is so freaking hard. You know, I'm thinking about, I have memories attached

1556
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:48,020
to all of these games. That's the sad thing. And I have to leave Life Force on there just

1557
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:52,460
because even though that game is harder than hell, it's awesome. You know, Symphony of

1558
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:58,100
the Night is awesome even though, of course, the Saturn version is great. Contra has the

1559
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:02,060
the turtle with the fetus ass.

1560
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:07,300
I never really played the Goemon game, so I had to give it a boot.

1561
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,300
You are a bitch.

1562
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,300
I'm sorry!

1563
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,300
You know, I really, really didn't play it.

1564
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:14,980
I'm just being picked on tonight.

1565
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:19,420
I've always wanted to, but because I have no experience attached to that game, I'm taking

1566
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,420
it out.

1567
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:24,940
Alright, well, that's okay, because I can get a little revenge, because this one was

1568
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:26,900
my next pick to go off the list.

1569
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:32,520
So my apologies to Jamie, but Kid Dracula, come on, Game Boy, I just don't have much

1570
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:36,520
sentiment attached to that game, and as Dave mentioned earlier, if you're going to have

1571
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,760
a Castlevania game on the list, it needs to be Symphony of the Night, or Dracula X is

1572
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,360
a good choice too, but not Kid Dracula.

1573
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,480
But cheap yellow card with a spiky Dragon Ball hair.

1574
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,440
I played it once, I played it once, and didn't need to play it again.

1575
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,440
So sorry, Jamie.

1576
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,200
And when you hit them, they go poom!

1577
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,200
I was considering Contra Shattered Soldier, but I don't know.

1578
01:45:54,200 --> 01:46:00,600
game is, is, I don't know, disgustingly beautiful. Alright. Uh, Ninja Turtles, okay, so here's

and Dracula X PC Engine Duo version.

1590
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:20,600
...

1591
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:25,600
...

1592
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:30,620
...

1593
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:35,620
...

1594
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:40,620
...

1595
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:47,620
Hm...

1596
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:54,620
Hm...

1597
01:51:54,620 --> 01:52:01,620
Hm...

1598
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:08,620
Hm...

1599
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:38,360
I didn't have a promo queued up, so we'll just

1600
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,440
get right back into it

1601
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,400

1602
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:44,880
uh... listen to or is on three or we will kill you

1603
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,920
and your first point

1604
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,760
uh... details

1605
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,820
here we go we have the final list all prepared for you guys

1606
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:55,560
uh... list is that winners are for the best

1607
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,000
not

1608
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,440
non-bomaniac

1609
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:00,700
best burp goes to sky thank you

1610
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,020
actually jamie had the best burp two weeks ago that

1611
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,960
that was really weak uh...

1612
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:42,960
And Gradius you could only have two options but I think the Nintendo ones you could have at least three if not four, but there was a version that you could only have two.

1613
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,000
So maybe it was the Game Boy one.

1614
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,880
Life Force was two!

1615
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,860
Maybe it was the Game Boy one, or Life Force.

1616
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:47,560
Life Force was two.

1617
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,220
Ok, maybe that's it.

1618
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,920
And in Gradius I know for a fact that in Gradius you could have four.

1619
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:59,920
You know why I bet that would make sense? Because in Life Force you could have two people on screen at the same time which you couldn't really have any for the other Gradius games.

1620
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,480
If you add four options a piece, you can basically be blown up the whole screen at once, so that

1621
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,480
makes a little sense.

1622
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,480
So I think you're right.

1623
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,480
Look at that flicker.

1624
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,480
I think Gradius I, you could have four, Lifers, you could have two.

1625
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,520
Maybe we'll just pull up the ROMs after the show and have a look, okay?

1626
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,520
We'll settle that.

1627
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,520
Go to my house and plug them in.

1628
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,560
Yeah, after the show, we're going to do some more music for you guys.

1629
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,480
We going to do the normal playlist, or you want to do an all 2DX night, or what do you

1630
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,480
think we should do?

1631
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,480
Let's be random.

1632
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,480
Let's be random.

1633
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,480
All para para.

1634
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,480
No.

1635
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,480
Super Eurobeat number one.

1636
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,240
Anyway, here we have our winners.

1637
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,240
Yes, we have our winners.

1638
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:35,160
Jamie, in third place, what is our third place winner?

1639
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,160
Sexy Parodius.

1640
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,160
Yeah.

1641
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:38,160
Sexy Mama.

1642
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,160
That game is so freaking cool.

1643
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:43,680
Like for the reasons I mentioned before, just because I like blowing up a Las Vegas showgirl

1644
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,680
and killing her to death.

1645
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,680
Alright.

1646
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:46,680
Killing her to death!

1647
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,320
Yay, there's redundancy for you.

1648
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:52,080
Number three, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1649
01:54:52,080 --> 01:55:00,800
Or for those of us who imported it, it would be Dracula X2 Nocturne in the Moonlight.

1650
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,280
It was officially in the Dracula X series.

1651
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:03,800
Which is a travesty.

1652
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,280
It should have been number one.

1653
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,680
You people have no taste, but that's fine.

1654
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:08,680
I forgive you.

1655
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:13,200
Number one, drum roll please, Ninja Turtles arcade game.

1656
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,200
Whee!

1657
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,100
I have such fond memories.

1658
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,240
By somewhat of a landslide, might I add.

1659
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:21,780
My god, it got like what, 65 votes, something like that?

1660
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:26,420
a lot for turtles the arcade game but we have people live in which is okay

1661
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:30,740
it's an okay first choice I guess you know but symphony night still should

1662
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,780
have been your number one

1663
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:35,500
and for that I reprimand all of you in the chat room but I would actually

1664
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:39,060
you know I was so addicted to Symphony of the night when it came out but when the

1665
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:40,420
Saturn version came out

1666
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:44,420
I blew through the whole game with Maria oh my god she like

1667
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:48,460
kicks Alucard's ass Maria is so powerful in that game

1668
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:53,620
There's very few places that she can't get to.

1669
01:55:53,620 --> 01:56:01,340
And then, um, there's also, though, I mean, what?

1670
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:02,780
I'm just laughing at chat things.

1671
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:03,780
Okay.

1672
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:04,780
Oh, yeah, you saw something up on the channel.

1673
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:05,780
Okay.

1674
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:08,300
We'll let Jamie finish her thought, and then we'll go on to the other tangent.

1675
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:10,860
My thought just got deflated, so you go ahead.

1676
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,860
Go on your tangent!

1677
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:12,860
See if I care.

1678
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:17,860
I have my propel to keep me happy.

1679
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:24,860
Pardon me while I eat on air, only on the internet.

1680
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:28,860
Lankystyle and I are on the same team here, we're rooting for Symphony of the Night.

1681
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:31,860
You guys are thinking memories instead of gameplay.

1682
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:35,860
You remember putting a bunch of quarters into the machine?

1683
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:41,860
What other game could you get Castlevania with Metroid style gameplay?

1684
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:42,860
play.

1685
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:43,860
I know.

1686
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:50,780
Hey, you can't forget the cliche Ninja Turtles thing, which had, well, two things really.

1687
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:55,380
Two, for the pseudo-3D, it had the diagonal walking down part, you know, where you had

1688
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,300
like sort of, you're going towards the camera, but not really.

1689
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:05,380
Then you also had the jet hover skateboard things for no apparent reason.

1690
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,380
Hmm.

1691
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:09,860
All right, so whatever, there was always going to be the Turtles people versus the Castlevania

1692
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,860
people.

1693
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,260
was cool and fuck RVGL for getting rid of it.

1694
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,700
Oh yeah, that's right, fuck them.

1695
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:15,700
I was actually before...

1696
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,700
They need a Castlevania arcade game, that'd be neat.

1697
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:20,620
It was close between Ninja Turtles and the Simpsons arcade game.

1698
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:24,380
The Simpsons arcade game was one I'm surprised didn't make the list, but it's the same engine

1699
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:27,860
as Turtles, so it's pretty much, I think a lot of people maybe are thinking Simpsons

1700
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:30,540
when they vote for TMNT, who knows.

1701
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:33,380
Couple other random notes before we finish out the show here, because it is about that

1702
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,380
time.

1703
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:38,740
They're talking about Propel in the chat room right now, Jamie, you'd like this, VidPower

1704
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:42,740
promoting Propel Water, and Black Lab's trying to steal your Propel Water.

1705
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:45,740
No, I'll eat his chat cookie.

1706
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:50,740
Propel is like, it tastes like Ghetto Kool-Aid, but not.

1707
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:54,740
Propel, the Orange Lounge choice of drink while playing DDR.

1708
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:56,740
Another random note.

1709
01:57:56,740 --> 01:58:01,740
A new test version of MaxXtreme, or MaxXtreme, DDRXtreme came out this week,

1710
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:04,740
and apparently Sakura has been removed as the extra stage

1711
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:06,740
and replaced with another paranoia,

1712
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:10,140
and Black Lab would like me to take a minute to tease Loki about it.

1713
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:11,800
Tease, tease, tease!

1714
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,800
Your response?

1715
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,680
First off, the machine's not done yet.

1716
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:20,700
So if they've had the song done and completed and it's a Konami original, why wouldn't they

1717
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:21,700
put it in there?

1718
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:24,540
Hello, there's going to be 200 fucking songs.

1719
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,420
It's going to be in the goddamn machine.

1720
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:30,520
It might not be an extra stage, no guarantee that it's probably not going to be an extra

1721
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,040
stage because that would be kind of redundant.

1722
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:35,060
You play Max and you play Max again.

1723
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:37,980
So that'd be kind of stupid, but it's going to be in the goddamn machine.

1724
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:43,940
Revenge, the song's done, it's a konami original.

1725
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:45,580
What more do you need?

1726
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:48,460
Alright, that's Loki's official response.

1727
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:51,220
Dave has another random note he wants to bring up before the show's over.

1728
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:57,500
On a side note, I AAA'd the remember me or remember you, what is it, and nothing.

1729
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,460
You obtain the highest dance level.

1730
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:00,460
That's it.

1731
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,700
No, you don't get shit for AAAing anything, I don't think.

1732
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:05,680
I think you get one of the earlier unlocks, something you've already unlocked by playing

1733
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,240
enough songs.

1734
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:12,480
Okay, and one more random note, because I promised you guys I would mention this in

1735
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,980
the chat room, I talked about this at the beginning of the show, somebody asked, when

1736
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:18,540
is Orange Lounge going three hours?

1737
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:19,540
We've been discussing this.

1738
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:23,120
We've been discussing this, and we are going to up the show to three hours, and it's going

1739
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,120
to start?

1740
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:25,120
Eventually.

1741
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,560
We're going to tell, let's tell them.

1742
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,960
We will start that with episode number 20.

1743
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,080
number twenty will be the first three hour show and that is by the way in two

1744
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,880
weeks

1745
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,520
uh... next week we're gonna be just too fucking exhausting after shaft i think

1746
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,840
we're gonna have a lot of

1747
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:41,060
lot of shaft wrap up a lot of interviews a lot out-of-towners next sunday they'll

1748
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:44,160
be big show but the first three hour show will be into what you watch it

1749
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:48,760
never doing eight-hour show come on

1750
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:49,480
okay

1751
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,640
and uh... jamie's got something she's talking about the after birth here

1752
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:56,200
yeah after birth will go a little bit old school so i can you know let you

1753
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,080
know about one of the greatest in

1754
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,760
least appreciative systems ever

1755
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,680
all right and uh...

1756
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:05,580
have to get some more fun everybody go around and give us your final five

1757
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:07,260
because i'm still trying to get the show

1758
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,300
uh... in the show wrap-up uh...

1759
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:12,100
the final five actually fitting get to do it

1760
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:14,740
uh... so i think i a go for it uh...

1761
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:17,220
really not too much going on other than the mac

1762
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:20,560
the air max you say uh... you guys come out thanks to me

1763
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,060
and uh...

1764
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:24,220
while max i guess

1765
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:31,220
Speaking of Team Wilo, they're gone again. I don't know where they went. It's news to me, so they're just buh-bye.

1766
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:40,220
And X-Step Release Candidate 4 is out. It's also probably going to be Version 1, so go check that out if you use it or not.

1767
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:50,220
And other than that, I'm going to be getting back onto the 2DX projects, so I'll have more of those 2DX sim files coming out for you guys to play on StepMania.

1768
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:52,220
And that's about it.

1769
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:54,220
Alright, Dave, any final thoughts?

1770
02:00:56,220 --> 02:01:09,220
Homework blows ass. That's it. Max USA, if anyone knows how to get the Hardcore 21 unlock, tell Rob, or post it, so I can look.

1771
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,220
Alright. Jamie, your final thought?

1772
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:15,220
Besides your random coughing fits?

1773
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:25,220
All of you people, go play Kid Dracula. You'll love me for it. Play Kid Dracula in Konami

1774
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:32,900
World. Go obscure, because I say so. And drink Propel. And come to Shaft.

1775
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:41,180
Come to Shaft. My final thought of the night, come to Shaft and I need a date. That's it.

1776
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:44,580
Stay tuned, we're going to be playing more music for you after the show's over. Stay

Then you'll be back at your crib chillin with a flat spliff thinking we were some crazy-ass angel

1794
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,360
Hell these fat round thick-ass vessels run up in the sky so deep get beat crying

1795
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,560
Yeah, you thought it was rain

1796
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:03,040
So bring a towel because it Delta it's laid out like that

1797
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:08,640

1798
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:16,240
catch the vapors as you be off and about. You going? We fly you there. You been? We done already

1799
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:22,640
flew up in there. We got you covered like a jimmy hat. At Delta we loves us some flying and it'd be
