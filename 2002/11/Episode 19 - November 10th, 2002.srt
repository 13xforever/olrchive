[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's been a long-ass weekend, that's all I have to say.

34
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,659
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most shafted radio station of all things Bimani.

00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,146
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm more on the funny part.

00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: No comment.

40
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:45,650
[SPEAKER_18]: They're coming to take me away, ha-ha, they're coming to take me away.

41
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello also to our newest co-host.

42
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Although he has been here since the beginning, he's still the noob.

43
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to Loki, everybody.

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

45
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:57,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the three of us tonight.

46
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:58,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave couldn't get a ride here.

47
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:01,259
[SPEAKER_08]: He was begging me for one about an hour before the show started.

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's probably at home with my copy of the freaking sign, that bastard.

49
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, do you have some hate mail for Dave?

50
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's wait until the FU's of the week.

51
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

52
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:18,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a really quick break.

53
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,990
[SPEAKER_18]: It's as if we didn't talk to tons of people before.

54
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:20,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

55
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,393
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can't tell, my throat's slightly going today.

56
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:26,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, it's not from anything dirty.

57
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,255
[SPEAKER_08]: You sick bastards.

58
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we've got a lot of big announcements.

59
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:46,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got local news about the big tournament we had yesterday, but that includes, like everything, we've got some show news, including big changes coming next week, coming to our website, I think, tonight.

60
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,709
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as that song doesn't play, we can talk about changes.

61
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:51,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we won't play the song changes.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,791
[SPEAKER_08]: You have nothing to worry about.

63
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, and then an F you to myself.

64
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:00,876
[SPEAKER_08]: is also coming up later, because I did something very, very bad yesterday.

65
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

66
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very bad and naughty.

67
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a naughty boy.

68
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Not by you, honey.

69
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Dave is claiming he hasn't taken my sign, so I will have to find it.

70
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:13,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

71
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:14,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, never mind.

72
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Dave's off the hook.

73
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:18,450
[SPEAKER_08]: He just got the blame because he left, and he was easy to blame.

74
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, it was all DDR Mike.

75
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,032
[SPEAKER_11]: He blamed you.

76
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,393
[SPEAKER_11]: He pointed the finger at you.

77
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:24,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Which sign?

78
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:24,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it the...

[SPEAKER_20]: Mel cracking up in the car today because I pointed out something to him that I noticed from day one.

[SPEAKER_08]: The one and only Mel B, right?

00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:42,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:42,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are we talking Melody?

[SPEAKER_20]: The QQQ sounds like ducks.

94
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:50,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

95
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,971
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're one of the breaks, we'll play it during the pre-show.

96
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,752
[SPEAKER_20]: But QQQ.

97
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:57,712

[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's listen to some QQQ.

101
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:06,806
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we're going to pull this up, and I want to take a survey from the chat room here.

102
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,067
[SPEAKER_20]: Tell me if this does or does not sound like ducks.

103
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Down to the laughter in the background.

104
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,848
Okay.

105
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:21,749
[SPEAKER_20]: Does it sound like a... See?

106
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,609
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like ducks.

107
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it sounds like the music that they play in the electric parade at Disneyland.

108
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:31,075
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a spiced up version of the chicken dance.

109
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:34,876
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it sounds like ducks, but it doesn't sound like chickens.

110
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:35,696
[SPEAKER_20]: Sharon, what do you think?

111
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,736
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like ducks, am I right?

112
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:36,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Say yes.

113
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,331
[SPEAKER_08]: They said work, work, work.

114
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,873
[SPEAKER_18]: They must be a little bit behind.

115
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, there is the clown.

116
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:50,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Demon child laughter.

117
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:53,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chat room always full of clowns.

118
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,569
[SPEAKER_08]: or they're comparing it to the dying giraffe noise.

119
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:14,818
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the Ultimate Tack pre-show, by the way, that you heard before we went live just now with every, I think, just damn near every Tack song from DDR and 2DX and then some.

120
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:17,700
[SPEAKER_20]: I took out Stoic on purpose.

121
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,301
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have against Stoic?

122
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Boring.

123
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoic isn't a highlight for me either.

124
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:23,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of a boring video.

125
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:23,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

126
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:23,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

127
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,101
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a stripped down holic.

128
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:30,063
[SPEAKER_20]: And holic is awesome.

129
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Take everything good out of holic and then you get stoic.

130
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,950
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's your expression after listening to it.

131
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,552
[SPEAKER_20]: You're like, just flat and stoic.

132
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, lots of big news.

133
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:43,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

134
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Today is just one big sigh, isn't it?

135
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,477
[SPEAKER_20]: I slept 13 and a half hours.

136
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:49,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you really?

137
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:50,219
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I did.

138
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,319
[SPEAKER_20]: I came home and took Vicodin.

139
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's fill everyone in that may have missed it.

140
00:12:56,142 --> 00:13:00,946
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we are an international show, Orange Lounge Radio, for the international Bomani community.

141
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Konnichiwa!

142
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:07,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But here in Sacramento, where we're based, as you probably may or may not know, in Northern California, we're based out of Sacramento.

143
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,451
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a huge tournament yesterday.

144
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Shaft.

145
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were all a big part of this, and we're all tired as fuck.

146
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:21,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And if any of you guys might have been tuned in for our live broadcast, Orange Lounge did broadcast the whole day live from Shaft.

147
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:27,421
[SPEAKER_08]: We cut it off around Improv Freestyle because it was starting to, yeah.

148
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,004
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only so much you can talk about at a tournament.

149
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:35,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to apologize for all those who did listen to the live broadcast.

150
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:36,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh.

151
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you never have to be subjected to something that horrible ever again.

152
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get some clips of Loki going insane, but there were some great moments.

153
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:10,524
[SPEAKER_08]: All I know is that I was standing on the Max 2 machine, and I looked over in the corner, and they'd taken the microphone, some of the folks that were helping us out, and drug it out the window.

154
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was Evan that did that.

155
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely going to talk about Evan a little bit here, too, because he did a great job.

156
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:24,689
[SPEAKER_08]: And the microphone was out the window, and Jahi was holding onto it, and I know this isn't going to translate well to radio, but he was standing there, and he's just going like this.

157
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:30,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking like he's ranting about something and I'm like, there's quality radio going on in the corner right now.

158
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, I so wish I could be there right now.

159
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:41,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, a big, big thank you to everybody that helped out with that live broadcast yesterday because Jamie was so busy with tournament things.

160
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so busy with tournament things.

161
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:46,226
[SPEAKER_08]: We let the noob, Loki, kind of take the brunt of a lot of that towards the beginning.

162
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:47,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I was all over the place.

163
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:48,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Towards the beginning.

164
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,468
[SPEAKER_20]: But he did a fabulous job.

165
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,689
[SPEAKER_20]: I kept going in the back room and...

166
00:14:52,749 --> 00:15:04,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Capt, just hearing the interviews going one after another, interviewing practically everybody who did an accuracy attack, and I just remember seeing a microphone in my face a few times going, huh?

167
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we're live.

168
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to go over here now.

169
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:10,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

170
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Just especially a big thank you to everybody that helped out with that.

171
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:15,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, of course.

172
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:21,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad, Irene, JB, 23M, Jahi.

173
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:22,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Just everybody that helped out.

174
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:26,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big, big thank you to Evan because he got really creative with it.

175
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Evan was born for Internet Radio.

176
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we have some Flyboys over here?

177
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Evan is a fucking riot.

178
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I got judged.

179
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:39,736
[SPEAKER_08]: He sat at the table for a little while and saw some forms.

180
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:44,539
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one contributing factor to how you guys ran out during Improv Freestyle, but that's okay.

181
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It was worth it.

182
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,203
[SPEAKER_08]: He judged me, and he wrote down on this thing, Nice flaming blue shirt.

183
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:51,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Just all this funny stuff.

184
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:52,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Evan cracks me up.

185
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:57,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish he could have been there the whole day, just to kind of ease the tension.

186
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to get him on the show.

187
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,232
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not...

188
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:02,793
[SPEAKER_08]: He plays Bomani, I think.

189
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:09,156
[SPEAKER_08]: He's kind of a closet Bomani fan, but he's maybe played it once or twice, but he wouldn't be able to talk about it like we do.

190
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:11,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's still funny, so I'll have to get him on here sometime.

191
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he might be listening, so hello, Evan, if you're listening.

192
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,619
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you.

193
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:23,983
[SPEAKER_11]: He had to kind of play relief because I was very sick yesterday at the same time doing the radio show, as anyone that listened realized.

194
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I was losing my voice.

195
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:29,789
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I had pretty much lost my voice by the end of the day.

196
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:37,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, I was talking on the radio, trying to think of... It was pretty much me being sick and all, like, just miserable.

197
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Just ranting on about whatever came to mind.

198
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:44,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it probably wasn't incoherent at parts, but, um...

199
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:45,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Go Donut!

200
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,777
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you ever seen a beautiful, beautiful sunset?

201
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,718
[SPEAKER_20]: And a flamingo is flying across the sunset.

202
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:11,479
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, it's holding a rose in its beak and a painting in its paws.

203
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Or claws, I guess.

204
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,301
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, you're drunk.

205
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Another deep thought by Jack Handy.

206
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:19,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That was beautiful.

207
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:21,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I have had a cry.

208
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:21,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

209
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:32,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I had three of them somewhere and I lost them all because I suck.

210
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:37,045
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember one day we would go visit my Uncle Caveman.

211
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:39,567
[SPEAKER_20]: We called him Uncle Caveman because he lived in a cave.

212
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,849
[SPEAKER_20]: And one day he would eat one of us.

213
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,590
[SPEAKER_20]: Later on we found out he was a bear.

214
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,996
[SPEAKER_20]: The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth.

215
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my favorite deep thought of all time was, it's true that every time you hear a bell ring, an angel gets its wings.

216
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:02,744
[SPEAKER_08]: But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set on fire.

217
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, yes, Shaft, the big topic, it's weighing heavily on our minds.

218
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,030
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait, you're sitting on my face.

219
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, a funny thing to tell a child is that when it rains, God is crying, probably because of something you did.

220
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there was one about how Disneyland burnt down.

221
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:36,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to play jokes on my little cousins.

222
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to play jokes on little children, so I took my leave.

223
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,805
[SPEAKER_20]: But it was getting pretty late.

224
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we pieced it together in there somewhere.

225
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Shaft.

226
00:18:58,128 --> 00:18:59,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Deep fried Twinkies.

227
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut your mouth.

228
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:00,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Deep fried Twinkies.

229
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

230
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,493
[SPEAKER_08]: What DDR tournament ever has deep fried Twinkies?

231
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:12,097
[SPEAKER_20]: I just know that we had the whole RTF versus Step Squad Twinkie eat out.

232
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:13,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, whoa.

233
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just say the RTF Step Squad Twinkie eat out?

234
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:21,404
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't mean it that way.

235
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:22,685
[SPEAKER_20]: My apologies.

236
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:29,591
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, apparently there was some sort of little mini... I think it was just teasing.

237
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:30,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up.

238
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:31,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week on Orange Lounge.

239
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:34,956
[SPEAKER_20]: If you use that, I'm going to kick you.

240
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:47,287
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but we were, basically it was just like, everyone was talking about the heart attack they were going to get, and then I hear something coming from a Kyoki saying, I just took one for Step Squad.

241
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Took one what?

242
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:49,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Twinkie?

243
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:52,675
[SPEAKER_20]: It was funny.

244
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:56,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was actually a guy there named Mr. Twinkie, which was pretty cool.

245
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:58,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Sir Twinkie, I'm sorry, Sir Twinkie.

246
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,181
[SPEAKER_20]: I met Sir Twinkie's mom, she was nice.

247
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:01,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, very cool.

248
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,525
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some people that came in from out of town.

249
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:06,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there was a caravan that came in from Reno, a bunch from the Bay.

250
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:09,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Biggest thanks to Fury for flying out from Omaha.

251
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:11,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my lord, Omaha in the house.

252
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:15,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And some SoCal, I believe there were some ER Maniacs folks from SoCal.

253
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:21,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And my apologies for constantly saying on the radio that he is from Kansas, because I was sick and out of it.

254
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard Omaha saying, Kansas?

255
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Kansas?

256
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Nebraska!

257
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,442
[SPEAKER_06]: We're Californian, Warrior Grant, thank you.

258
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,143
[SPEAKER_20]: I ain't Californian, originally.

259
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:34,744
[SPEAKER_20]: I know my states, yo.

260
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,645
[SPEAKER_08]: What else about Shaft yesterday?

261
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:38,485
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much to talk about.

262
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about the winning freestyle routines.

263
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:41,186
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all a freestyle, really.

264
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Which I saw three pieces of.

265
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,320
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't get to see that much of Freestyle, huh?

266
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,580
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I was working.

267
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of us don't get to be the MC.

268
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, dear.

269
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,646
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think about a lot of this stuff?

270
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:57,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely have my favorites.

271
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,088
[SPEAKER_08]: What were some of your favorites?

272
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:10,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I'd have to, well, there's some really interesting ones and I'm sure we can go into a little bit later about how unorthodox a few of the, uh, rigs we had going there were.

273
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:12,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, yes, we'll get into that.

274
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:20,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but definitely, um, I'd have to say my two favorites, you know, obviously first and second place, uh, Tranpower, you know, his routine was awesome.

275
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I only got to see that from distance.

276
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing Max 2 Guard during that time, so I only got to see it from distance.

277
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:29,618
[SPEAKER_08]: There were too many people blocking the way, so I only saw the top half of him, like his head bobbing up and down.

278
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,299
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very good.

279
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,741
[SPEAKER_20]: I did see it.

280
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:33,701
[SPEAKER_20]: It was so smooth.

281
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:34,402
[SPEAKER_20]: It was really nice.

282
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:35,043
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very good.

283
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,764
[SPEAKER_11]: He is an awesome freestyler.

284
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:40,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Even his improv was right on.

285
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:42,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

286
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked like a routine.

287
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It was crazy.

288
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:53,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Then first place, you know, obviously went to Bruce Leroy and all I have to say is, man, that guy's got some funk in him.

289
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:55,932
[SPEAKER_20]: I have one thing to say about Wendell.

290
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:57,454
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-mm, good.

291
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:05,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was actually just about to say, and our chat room is going crazy about it right now, because Wendell and I can't remember the name of his partner.

292
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:06,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember who it was?

293
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:08,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like an ass.

294
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:09,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

295
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:10,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, Holland.

296
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:10,967
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it.

297
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:17,473
[SPEAKER_08]: They did this hilarious routine to a DDR song that usually annoys a lot of people.

298
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:29,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically what they did, and as the chat room's going, roast beef, roast beef, hot, hot, hot.

299
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:36,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically they did this routine to this song where basically Wendell was fighting for a sandwich.

300
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,687
[SPEAKER_08]: The other guy had a sandwich, Holland had a sandwich.

301
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:42,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the way they were choreographed to the words was great.

302
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:44,409
[SPEAKER_08]: That was hilarious.

303
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved that.

304
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the better routines I saw all day, I thought.

305
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:49,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, really...

306
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:58,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Every routine, I mean, I didn't, now, keep in mind I didn't get to stick around for Improv Freestyle, but every routine I saw that day was great.

307
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It really was.

308
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:11,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, to point out some of the more hilarious routines, or I don't even know if we can call them routines, there was one that's, I don't even know who was doing it because there ended up being like six or seven people on the stage when it happened.

309
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:16,704
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for Twilight Zone where they're doing the Mortal Kombat rendition there.

310
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:17,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That was hilarious.

311
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:19,165
[SPEAKER_08]: The Goro made that.

312
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The Goro thing, when they were stomping on the ground, that was the shit.

313
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:24,267
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

314
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:34,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, notably, probably the most eyebrow-raising routine of the evening was about ten people all in the routine area doing It's Raining Men.

315
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:44,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And Irene, the rice princess, is a frequent contributor to this show, and also I think one of the world's only holders of an Orange Lounge t-shirt, which we don't even have, as host of the show.

316
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,838
[SPEAKER_08]: She just was up there singing, and she had her Flyboys on.

317
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yes, DDRholic, Anita, was up there.

318
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:54,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Anita was doing the actual dancing so they wouldn't fail.

319
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Irene was just singing, and then they had Flyboys.

320
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:03,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you'd heard Evan saying earlier in the evening, I need some Flyboys!

321
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,602
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to get some Flyboys!

322
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:10,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, the first two people to speak up, Sunia and Rai Rai, two cute younger girls, are all, We'll do it!

323
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:11,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you're not a boy!

324
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:12,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay!

325
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:14,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

326
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:24,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that was kind of a very eyebrow-raising routine where a lot of people were just like... I just remember walking by the machine and seeing Bruce Leroy with his hands in the air doing the swish.

327
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:25,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Swish.

328
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:28,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he shot the perfect free throw.

329
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:30,734
[SPEAKER_08]: That was... Bruce's routine, really, was swish.

330
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:32,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And that guy has come a long way.

331
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:34,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see a routine... He was wearing orange.

332
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:34,817
[SPEAKER_08]: The one...

333
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:38,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The one tournament I ever was a freestyle judge at was an old Sac State tournament.

334
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:45,982
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was before, like, Hypnotix and Bruce Lee were really well known as freestylers throughout the scene, and they were both there, and they did excellent jobs.

335
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:46,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

336
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:47,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

337
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:50,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Very good.

338
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:58,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I did see a little bit of the improv, and there was a little bit of what I saw was good.

339
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:05,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Improv, by the way, was a last minute addition to Shaft because we just wanted to keep it going.

340
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:12,329
[SPEAKER_20]: We had a few hiccups with the tourney, which we'll come to in my fuckies of the week.

341
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,531
[SPEAKER_20]: But everything seemed to go pretty good.

342
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:20,053
[SPEAKER_20]: And by the way, I have to say right now, a big congratulations to Orange Beanie.

343
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:23,835
[SPEAKER_20]: for making, in his first tournament, fourth place.

344
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:30,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we're probably playing favorites because he's a Sacramento kid, but you know, we gotta show some Sacto love.

345
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:39,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, even so, to come in fourth place in your first tournament is quite a... You know, Jessica and I were talking a few weeks ago about how he came up and said, oh my god, how can you perfect attack so well?

346
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:52,325
[SPEAKER_20]: And to have him come up and do that well when only not too long ago he was looking at all of us, that right there, he gets a big pass from me.

347
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:57,686
[SPEAKER_11]: All I've got to say is yesterday some of the most unorthodox things happened at that tournament.

348
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:01,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start off with the setup.

349
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously we had fourth mix down that day.

350
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:05,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Which I need to give a little bit of background on.

351
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,188
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, go ahead.

352
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:08,628
[SPEAKER_20]: The security card...

353
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,386
[SPEAKER_20]: I know how many people know about how a DDR machine works.

354
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,955
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a CD that links up to a security card.

355
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:19,156
[SPEAKER_20]: And the security card basically makes you able to play the disc.

356
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:25,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what it is is they needed a cartridge that will sync the security card to the disc.

357
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:29,084
[SPEAKER_20]: And their fourth mix came pre-loaded, so they didn't have that cartridge.

358
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:35,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Because Melody was telling me that her solo did the same thing when it had damage done to it.

359
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,770
[SPEAKER_20]: So we got the card in, but they weren't synced.

360
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,632
[SPEAKER_20]: So the fourth mix stayed down, so...

361
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:52,903
[SPEAKER_20]: And another big thanks to Maple and Iguana Girl for going and modding those pads for us during the tournament so that we could have them to put on the stage instead of the fourth mix pads.

362
00:26:53,524 --> 00:27:01,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were going to hook up a fourth mix on the PS2, but we didn't have third mix because of transfer team.

363
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:10,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was just going to say a big congratulations to everybody that was involved getting the fourth mix situation to work.

364
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:21,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think this is, it's probably not the first time PlayStation has been used in a big tournament like this, because I know a while back they were going to do something with the Club of Pens and OHA or something like that, and I don't know if that ever happened or not.

365
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,562
[SPEAKER_20]: It was supposed to be at the last two next tournaments.

366
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:32,390
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly the simulator, ending up having to use Step Mania to do a third mix song just because there was just no options left.

367
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,272
[SPEAKER_08]: That was downright innovative.

368
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:38,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's give Matt the applause.

369
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:53,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, me and my stupid sim, you know, I just happened to have my computer with me because I was using it for, well actually it was for the after party, you know, I had my sim with me and everything and I have all the setup to, you know, rig everything together.

370
00:27:53,908 --> 00:28:01,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So we went ahead and rigged it with my TV out onto the TV and we had the pads going through my inputs and it worked great.

371
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:07,279
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a third mix after the Game of Love working there and, you know, come to find out, you know,

372
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Fury, his only routine was on 4th

373
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:44,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, and look at this, you've got two guys, you've got one guy who came all the way from Omaha for the tournament, and then you've got Tran, who hasn't really been very active in the scene for the past four months or so, you know, he hasn't been very active, he kind of, he took a little hiatus, you know, whatever the reason be, personal, whatever, but it was good, it was great to see him back and doing a freestyle again, and it would have been so awful to have to turn these guys away, but it was really a situation that was just out of our hands, there's nothing we could do.

374
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:45,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Turned out to work out

375
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,299
[SPEAKER_08]: and it worked out awesome.

376
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so happy that all worked out.

377
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:52,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So big props to the Fourth Mix Repair people.

378
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:53,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we'll call them that.

379
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:55,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thank you.

380
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:03,215
[SPEAKER_20]: It took a major hiccup and made it more of a productive burp.

381
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:09,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And a big thank you, I believe too, and I apologize if I get this wrong, I believe it was JM3P that brought the metal pad for Match USA?

382
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:10,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think so.

383
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think so too.

384
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Big thanks to the folks that helped that get set up.

385
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:18,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And a thank you to the DDR Spot staff that was there doing the videos.

386
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:24,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Big thanks to Mike Noe and AJ for taking care of filming all that for us.

387
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:34,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, one of the biggest thanks goes to, of course, Konami and Jason Enos for donating DVR Max and a few t-shirts to give out for prizes.

388
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:39,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, maybe we'll see Jason in a tournament in the future, maybe.

389
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:39,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

390
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:40,018
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can swing it.

391
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:40,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

392
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:43,263
[SPEAKER_20]: and DarkSakura.com.

393
00:29:59,562 --> 00:30:10,171
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing, after a tournament, it's probably not the best idea to have a party, honestly, because everybody is so dead and so tired, especially amongst the staff.

394
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:14,375
[SPEAKER_08]: If we weren't all local people, maybe we'd have more energy in us, but we were just so dead.

395
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:18,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We just all kind of sat here and watched movies and played video games.

396
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,920
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have one thing I have to say about last night.

397
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Power Glove.

398
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:26,305
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so bad.

399
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:32,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, uh, just keep your power gloves off for a pat, huh?

400
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:33,986
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to say.

401
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:34,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

402
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:48,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was exhausted after, you know, we were supposed to be having fun stuff and I had a major headache, you know, being sick and everything.

403
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:58,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And I came back and I set up my metal pads and all that and, of course, every time I set up my metal pads and they never worked the first time and I ended up having to dissect these damn things to get them to work.

404
00:30:59,324 --> 00:30:59,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Baby Bush Baby

405
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:34,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so I'm getting the sense in the chat room, and if you want to join our chat room, you're just going to join any other side IRC server, and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

406
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:40,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting the sense that some of the people who weren't here in town are kind of left here with question marks over their head right now.

407
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:45,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about something a little more adaptable to folks that are listening to us international.

408
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:49,664
[SPEAKER_08]: What were some things that we learned from the tournament that other people can take to their tournaments?

409
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:52,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Make sure that you have backups for everything that you do.

410
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:56,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you have plenty of paper for the printers.

411
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you have one cash box.

412
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:58,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

413
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:00,253
[SPEAKER_20]: Make sure...

414
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:17,667
[SPEAKER_20]: It's better to have a big staff because things will run a lot smoothly if you've got everything coordinated.

415
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:23,954
[SPEAKER_08]: The staff this year was probably three times as big as last year and it helped immensely.

416
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:28,698
[SPEAKER_20]: This made me feel very good to hear that lots of people came up and said that we had a very efficient staff.

417
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh good, that's a very good compliment.

418
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:39,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Make sure, you know, I thought it was a great idea that we had ElectroTal as our backup MC.

419
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:45,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I am especially glad because after you guys added that other tournament and my voice was already starting to go, I was like, eh.

420
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:50,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But Tal took the reins on that and, from what I understand, did a fabulous job.

421
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:54,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I had to get to the house before anybody else did to get the party started, but...

422
00:32:54,901 --> 00:33:02,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Make sure that if you're going to introduce another portion of the tournament the day of the tournament, that you have backup judges, because our judges did look pretty tired.

423
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:03,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

424
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:06,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, guys, but thank you for sticking it out like that.

425
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:14,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we kind of expected it would be that long anyway, but a team, unfortunately, with a fourth mixed problems didn't catch on, so to speak.

426
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:16,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to have to just do it again.

427
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,224
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:47,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the judges are not just giving scores, they're giving comments and suggestions on how to better the freestyle.

429
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And that all takes a little bit of time.

430
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So we tried best we could to kind of get people up there and interview them.

431
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had some good stuff.

432
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,107
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some great in-between stuff.

433
00:33:55,328 --> 00:34:01,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Bran got up there and did a hilarious imitation of... I don't know what you'd call him, but it was funny.

434
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:05,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bruce Leroy... Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

435
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:08,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce Leroy did a great improv little...

436
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:11,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatbox thing, which is great.

437
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:12,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I did hear that, that was awesome.

438
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,200
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.

439
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:16,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they did that on Orange Lounge a little later too, so that was cool too.

440
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:19,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So, great stuff.

441
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:26,196
[SPEAKER_20]: I, as frazzled as I was, I had a good time and I got hugged a lot.

442
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,517
[SPEAKER_20]: People just grabbed me and started hugging me.

443
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,159
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the best part of a tournament, isn't it?

444
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that the best part of a tournament is just drive-by huggings?

445
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:33,443
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it was nice.

446
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:34,384
[SPEAKER_20]: It made me feel happy.

447
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:45,334
[SPEAKER_20]: But the best comments that I could have heard the whole time that I kept hearing is that we had a good time and just hearing we had a good time and when's the next one, that made me feel really good.

448
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:56,184
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole tournament set up actually reminded me of sort of an anime convention, because we had like, you know, it was just kind of crazy, and you had people doing their own thing everywhere, like watching movies on their laptops.

449
00:34:56,464 --> 00:35:08,415
[SPEAKER_11]: We had, you know, I was kind of bored at certain points, you know, before we actually got the tournament running, and so we had people playing DDR Max on Metal Pad, we had someone else playing Step Mania on a sim,

450
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:21,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I had, you know, people were playing the DDR Max 2 on free play and I had my sim sitting there because we were using my computer for the PA system and I was playing through there too.

451
00:35:21,923 --> 00:35:35,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and of course, because what tournament would be, you know, without Tanook Tanook, we went ahead and played that too during one of the big breaks and also played one of those, ah shit, I can't remember the artist's,

452
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:37,673
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we played B4U.

453
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:39,054
[SPEAKER_11]: What was it?

454
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:41,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Who?

455
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Kutu, I forget what it's called.

456
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:44,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Kutimu.

457
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Kutimu, yeah, we played the Kutimu B4U.

458
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:47,339
[SPEAKER_20]: The vocal B4U.

459
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Which people are kind of going, huh?

460
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:55,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there were the people, it's like, what was it that, um, that, uh,

461
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,797
[SPEAKER_20]: was it Margaret Cho that said it?

462
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:23,796
[SPEAKER_20]: it's like some of you laugh and some of you just smile and nod but yes, the biggest advice we could give from Sacramento to the rest of the world from what we learned this weekend make your tournament fun that's the number one priority you need to have when scheduling a tournament fun, fun, fun keep drama away from your tournament if you've got something going on behind the scenes you don't need to let the rest of the people know it as far as they need to see, things are running fine yep

463
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:42,533
[SPEAKER_08]: and really, it wasn't, I mean, there were, sure there were things falling apart behind the scenes, I wouldn't say falling apart, but you know, just problems, but they were solved, and there was no drama, there really wasn't, at least not that I really saw, so maybe I'm just ignorant, but I didn't see any drama, which is great, so.

464
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:50,531
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there almost was with some people that were there, but we won't make comments on those people, you know, and on any of that.

465
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:57,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Just that I want to thank people who kept their patience, you know, with certain situations.

466
00:36:58,156 --> 00:36:58,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Poopy on drama.

467
00:36:59,257 --> 00:36:59,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, poopoo.

468
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:01,278
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

469
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:01,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Piles of feces.

470
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to take a quick break, and when we come back, I'm being told that around 8 o'clock-ish...

471
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: That DSCS SoCal kicks our buddy down in SoCal who is being our HTML whore basically Because I can't seem to get our old website updated anymore because it's just over my head So he said, okay, you suck, I'm going to just do the damn site So I'm like, cool!

472
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:34,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's been working very hard on it and I believe he's going to have it done tonight And we're going to look at the site on the very show And we're going to peruse it and give our feedback, our instant feedback

473
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:57,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we're all going to love them forever so we'll be talking about some show stuff right after the break things that you'll want to hear if you're a fan of Orange Lounge and we thank you for listening we're going to start this off with a song we heard a lot of yesterday and we just still can't get enough of it not Sugaru, don't worry no, not Sugaru, not the Accuracy Attack song how about the Freestyle song of the day, shall we?

474
00:37:58,489 --> 00:37:59,029

[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

477
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:04,205
[SPEAKER_16]: For an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

478
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:11,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

479
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,230
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

480
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:18,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

481
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:20,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, our buddy Mel B, who was...

482
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:27,762
[SPEAKER_08]: In the studio, literally minutes before we went on Arabidive, but unfortunately they have a long trip ahead of them and couldn't really stick around.

483
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But we thank them for being here this weekend because I know they both were helping out immensely with the tournament this weekend.

484
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:35,669
[SPEAKER_20]: They're fun house guests.

485
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Lots of fun to hang out with.

486
00:43:37,772 --> 00:43:38,372
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd that go?

487
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:43,217
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to the same Mongolian barbecue place, though, I believe Friday and today.

488
00:43:43,237 --> 00:43:43,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

489
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:54,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, they just ended up crashing out last night while I was making a special banner for Wendell in a tribute to his roast beefy goodness routine.

490
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Roast beef!

491
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Roast beef!

492
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:56,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Hot!

493
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:56,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Hot!

494
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:58,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Hot!

495
00:43:58,254 --> 00:43:58,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

496
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,399
[SPEAKER_20]: So, it was pretty good, and now I'm going to go get my taquitos.

497
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:03,879
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go get your taquitos.

498
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:04,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

499
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you enjoy those taquitos.

500
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at what the chat room's talking about.

501
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:16,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're talking about Orange Lounge Forums, which we're going to try and have on the new site eventually.

502
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:17,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be there right away, but soon.

503
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:26,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're a pyro man, our resident comedian's back, talking about how he was locked in his room masturbating to a glue stick inserted into a CD.

504
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:28,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, that's very nice.

505
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:29,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for sharing.

506
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And how he's currently expanding his pornography collection.

507
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:33,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

508
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,496
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always a good idea.

509
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:36,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta keep a variety.

510
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:37,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray for pornography.

511
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of pornography, they were watching yesterday at the tournament.

512
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:45,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're talking about pornography, Jamie.

513
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:47,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You missed all the good stuff.

514
00:44:50,311 --> 00:45:01,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Dave's, Dave's getting pissed in the chat room, cause he brought those taquitos for the party last night, but we were so dead that nobody thought to cook them.

515
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for my dinner, Dave.

516
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:09,661
[SPEAKER_08]: First we don't give him a ride here, and then we eat his food.

517
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:11,241
[SPEAKER_08]: We are such assholes.

518
00:45:13,482 --> 00:45:15,263
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not an asshole, I'm a bitch, get it right.

519
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:19,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, where the fuck was I?

520
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:22,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anymore.

521
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

522
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:29,248
[SPEAKER_11]: We were talking about... Shaft?

523
00:45:29,408 --> 00:45:31,471
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we were talking about... Oh, porn!

524
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:32,512
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about porn!

525
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:35,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear God, how could I forget?

526
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:36,597
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about pornography.

527
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:39,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And the tournament yesterday.

528
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:45,930
[SPEAKER_08]: At the tournament yesterday, on the little iMac, they were watching the Dirty video by Christina Aguilera.

529
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,611
[SPEAKER_08]: In between... The Titanium Power Book, yes.

530
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:51,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Watching Christina Aguilera with Dirty.

531
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:53,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they were watching, I believe, the Girls Gone Wild videos.

532
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:58,216
[SPEAKER_20]: I missed the... She made the disc for Islander.

533
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,271
[SPEAKER_20]: and then Mike No took it.

534
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:07,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man, I miss the Girls Gone Wild videos.

535
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I miss all the good shit at tournaments.

536
00:46:11,775 --> 00:46:23,021
[SPEAKER_08]: We do agree though that next time we do an Orange Lounge live broadcast from a tournament, we're going to actually go to the tournament as participants and not staff.

537
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:27,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to demand that we be allowed to SportsCenter.

538
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:28,865
[SPEAKER_08]: in the back of the room.

539
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:43,918
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to be in front of the machine, but in the back of the room so we can actually see the machine instead of being... See, you know, to add to the whole porn thing, I could have brought about, you know, a couple hundred tapes of Playboy videos to pass out along with the DVDs, but I thought that wouldn't be family-oriented.

540
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,760
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not a family fun center function, unfortunately.

541
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, uh, you know, maybe at a, uh, different kind of, maybe it's for the next edit contest?

542
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:54,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it could, that should be your next edit contest.

543
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's edit contest of pornography.

544
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Make edit get porn.

545
00:46:58,307 --> 00:46:59,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Make edit get porn.

546
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:00,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

547
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:03,270
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be like a, that should be an international thing.

548
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:07,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, that should, I would, I think Orange Lounge needs to sponsor that contest.

549
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Make edit get porn.

550
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:12,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you heard it here.

551
00:47:13,006 --> 00:47:13,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

552
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:14,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I will do this.

553
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:16,208
[SPEAKER_11]: I will do this that you ask.

554
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:16,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

555
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,171
[SPEAKER_09]: The make, edit, get porn contest.

556
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Details coming soon.

557
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,557
[SPEAKER_09]: To get those details...

558
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

559
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:38,494
[SPEAKER_08]: To get those details, you'll want to log on to our website, which is currently being reinvented as we speak.

560
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:40,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Your HP is tasty.

561
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:48,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting for the word from SoCalKicks to... Oh, you've already got a pre-registration.

562
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:54,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just waiting for the words to SoCalKicks and everything's finished.

563
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, we'll go look at the new site.

564
00:47:57,688 --> 00:47:59,770
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'll, uh... Save me some boy porn and I'll do it.

565
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:01,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any boy porn?

566
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:04,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, not really, no.

567
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:05,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

568
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:09,781
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe there's, like, you know, guy on girl porn that actually, like, shows the guy.

569
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, well, we've got...

570
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:36,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know for a fact they can get a hold of a ton of Playboy videos, I mean, shit, man, I, from, like, for, like, the last eight months, I have every single video that's been released, and they're all crap, I mean, they're great, but, um, no, it's just, I don't know, they have their own, like, series that's, uh, called Playboy Exposed, it's actually, like, Girls Gone Wild, except, you know, kind of even more ridiculous, but, whatever.

571
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:36,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Completely...

572
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:38,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Off Topic from Imani Anything.

573
00:48:39,065 --> 00:48:41,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard they're making a movie out of Girls Gone Wild.

574
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:47,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, it's gonna be, like, actual actresses who portray these sorority girls that end up participating in the videos.

575
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,391
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like Porky's 3 or something.

576
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:51,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit, man.

577
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,021
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be bigger than Jackass, I guarantee it.

578
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:00,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is inside news for everyone.

579
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:10,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I read today on Weekly World News, okay, that Nostradamus predicted that Britney Spears is going to convert to Islam.

580
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Nostradamus predicted it, then it must be true.

581
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:13,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

582
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:17,550
[SPEAKER_08]: You might want to have to dispute this rumor going on in the chat room here, Loki.

583
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what you have to say about this, but you need to set something straight, so to speak.

584
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:24,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I prefer his Playgirl.

585
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never even seen Playgirl.

586
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,711
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is that?

587
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:29,972
[SPEAKER_08]: SoCalKicks just being a jerk.

588
00:49:30,293 --> 00:49:33,794
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just not turned on about the fact that they don't really do anything.

589
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:36,976
[SPEAKER_11]: All the movies are exactly the same.

590
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:41,278
[SPEAKER_11]: They all put them in situations where they start feeling themselves up for no apparent reason.

591
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:45,240
[SPEAKER_11]: They appear to try to have sex, but for some reason just...

592
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Get Nowhere Near Having Sex

593
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:11,112
[SPEAKER_11]: And this one's actually pretty sweet, but... No, we're fine.

594
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,872
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no Bomani Talk tonight, just porn.

595
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:14,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Come back later.

596
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:17,293
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's actually pretty cool.

597
00:50:17,313 --> 00:50:20,454
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got Julia Strains in it, you know.

598
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:21,354
[SPEAKER_11]: She's pretty famous.

599
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:26,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, Sexcore TV is a really live show that they have on Playboy TV.

600
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:29,256
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really stupid.

601
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,857
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, my girlfriend doesn't let me go down on her.

602
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:36,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, your punishment is you let him go down on you.

603
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,088
[SPEAKER_11]: In my courtroom on the show right now!

604
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what happens.

605
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:41,690
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of stupid, but...

606
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:55,821
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to add, I forget what their booth is or whatever, but it's this giant seashell bed thing that looks like something out of a Little Mermaid porno sequence or something like that.

607
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:58,023
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the weirdest thing.

608
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,526
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's definitely a good movie.

609
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus I have a couple other ones that are really strange.

610
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:06,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had to get it because I saw the poster for it and it was just funny.

611
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:08,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Playmate of the Apes.

612
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:17,102
[SPEAKER_20]: I've only ever seen two porn.

613
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:22,044
[SPEAKER_20]: One of them was the boneheads, like the coneheads with collapsible tops.

614
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:25,265
[SPEAKER_20]: As in inwardly collapsible, so they could use them.

615
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:27,206
[SPEAKER_20]: And Final Thug X.

616
00:51:27,932 --> 00:51:28,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fuck X's winner.

617
00:51:29,012 --> 00:51:32,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, I have to add that these aren't true pornos, these are softcore porn.

618
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:34,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Skinamax porn!

619
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Skinamax porn.

620
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:41,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now, if you want to get some good porn, you need to definitely go with the Vivid DVDs.

621
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:43,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Vivid DVDs are awesome.

622
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:46,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the extras on them are worth another movie right there.

623
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:48,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, a lot of them are like a twofer.

624
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,901
[SPEAKER_11]: You get one movie plus bonus features, plus another movie with bonus features, so...

625
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:53,362
[SPEAKER_11]: www.DarkSakura.com

626
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I know, in the Sacramento area.

627
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:13,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, in Sacramento area, I know that you can go to Video Clearance Center.

628
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:15,122
[SPEAKER_11]: They got porn as cheap as like two bucks.

629
00:52:15,722 --> 00:52:18,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So go there and check it out, man.

630
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:23,186
[SPEAKER_08]: You are pretty much being worshipped in the chat room right now.

631
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:24,527
[SPEAKER_20]: And another bit money news.

632
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:30,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That Loki knows his porno and remind me when I go to NorCal to go to Loki's.

633
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:32,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki is pornified.

634
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:35,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And porn on talk on Orange Lounge.

635
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I never thought I would see the day.

636
00:52:37,463 --> 00:52:38,284
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a taquito.

637
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:39,425
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have a taquito?

638
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:41,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

639
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have a comment, Porn and Orange Chicken, which, you know, yesterday at the tournament, take this back to Mamani a little bit, you brought over some Boston Market and you got a half chicken.

640
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:55,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a half chicken.

641
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,202
[SPEAKER_08]: You were that damn hungry, but you gave a hunk of it to Loki.

642
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:00,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's Loki there sitting eating some chicken.

643
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,705
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, you know what goes great with chicken?

644
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:07,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I said grape soda, but then somebody else said porn.

645
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:09,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I remember that.

646
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,231
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just so professional during this.

647
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:14,436
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm having a meeting of all the judges while I'm eating chicken.

648
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:26,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was hilarious because they were trying to pass me a demo of the scorecard sheet thing and my hands were all greasy and sticky from, you know, WHOA!

649
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:28,035
[SPEAKER_11]: From the chicken!

650
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:29,896
[SPEAKER_11]: From the goddamn chicken, okay?

651
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:32,097
[SPEAKER_11]: The chicken was damn good.

652
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Get him a Norelco for those palms.

653
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:44,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but the chicken was very greasy, so, you know, obviously I was just, you know, going, uh, don't hand me that, because I don't want to touch that, and, you know, get all these grease marks all over it.

654
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:45,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But, good chicken.

655
00:53:46,212 --> 00:53:51,614
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer that nobody did give, though, we got grape soda, we got porn, nobody said waffles.

656
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:54,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Chicken and Waffle.

657
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody said waffles.

658
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:56,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame.

659
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:58,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I flog you all.

660
00:53:59,571 --> 00:54:01,172
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Dave who said porn and chicken.

661
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:02,533
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't give him credit, he'll cry.

662
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:03,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's see.

663
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:15,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, I have to add, since we were going to originally talk about, I believe, Showgirls that we watched last night, I have to say that Showgirls is a complete waste of time.

664
00:54:15,683 --> 00:54:22,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, it's got, you know, T&A, but it's three hours long and it's got, like, a plot.

665
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:24,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I will cut you.

666
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:27,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge is great.

667
00:54:28,253 --> 00:54:33,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Showgirls is like the greatest movie ever because it is so bad.

668
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:35,800
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like watching trainwreck cinema.

669
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I like watching her bump and grind on people, so that was all worth it for me.

670
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:45,109
[SPEAKER_20]: And in other Bimani news, I like DDR.

671
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,331
[SPEAKER_20]: I like Beatmania.

672
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:50,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Apparently, other people like Beat It Mania.

673
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,370
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

674
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,231
[SPEAKER_08]: DDRholic.

675
00:54:56,711 --> 00:55:00,052
[SPEAKER_08]: DDRholic says, I may not be a guy, but I like porn.

676
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:01,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen, sister.

677
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:04,434
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more porn freaks in this world.

678
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:05,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Porn is funny.

679
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:06,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Porn is funny.

680
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:07,816
[SPEAKER_08]: An ideal woman.

681
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,637
[SPEAKER_11]: She likes porn more than I do.

682
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:11,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

683
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:12,818
[SPEAKER_20]: I like boy porn.

684
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:20,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is a yaoi fanatic as she shoves her iron fist of justice into the air.

685
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:23,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Iron fisting.

686
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:33,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then I have to also add that, as well as my hentai collection, we're not going to go there either.

687
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

688
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:45,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So, just when we're starving to get a new topic, I have SoCalKicks in his typical IRC way telling me 40 times in the chatroom, line after line, that he has finished.

689
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:50,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's see what we get if we go to our website right now.

690
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:50,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

691
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:51,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, not just yet.

692
00:55:51,146 --> 00:55:53,927
[SPEAKER_08]: At orangelounge.skie.cx.

693
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:54,908
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to it right now.

694
00:55:54,948 --> 00:55:55,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

695
00:55:55,988 --> 00:56:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

696
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna go browsing, we're gonna go browsing

697
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:44,091
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty sick that, you know, here we are, the host of the show.

698
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know a damn thing about our own website.

699
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:50,797
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

700
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:53,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we go to the website, we can click right here on the main page.

701
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what we get.

702
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:55,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

703
00:56:56,923 --> 00:56:57,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge.

704
00:56:57,904 --> 00:57:00,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the newly redesigned Orange Lounge site.

705
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:02,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to me, SoCalKick.

706
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:04,490
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thanks to you.

707
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:09,559
[SPEAKER_08]: This site will be very easy to run to the point Rob can even update it.

708
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I appreciate that.

709
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,461
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, all pages are very under construction as Sky himself goes in and makes this site his own.

710
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:19,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, Jamie and Loki might want to participate too.

711
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,542
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have pictures.

712
00:57:21,843 --> 00:57:24,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we'll have new pictures.

713
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:25,644
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually looks like my nose.

714
00:57:25,684 --> 00:57:27,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to be supermodels anymore.

715
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:30,085
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to jump in a garbage can.

716
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,646
[SPEAKER_20]: I will no longer look like Barbra Streisand.

717
00:57:33,306 --> 00:57:34,947
[SPEAKER_08]: You did not look like Barbra Streisand.

718
00:57:34,987 --> 00:57:35,967
[SPEAKER_20]: The nose was.

719
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:37,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

720
00:57:38,028 --> 00:57:38,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it looked cute.

721
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:39,689
[SPEAKER_08]: The nose was not like that.

722
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:40,189
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay.

723
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,592
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take new pics just because people want updated pictures of ourselves.

724
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

725
00:57:44,812 --> 00:57:47,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Of ourselves in the singular.

726
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:49,534
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob, is there something you're not telling us?

727
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:51,115
[SPEAKER_20]: How many of you live in there?

728
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:53,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Knock, knock!

729
00:57:53,396 --> 00:57:53,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Forty.

730
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:55,337
[SPEAKER_08]: In a row.

731
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:56,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Thirty-seven.

732
00:57:56,197 --> 00:58:01,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Try not to get any more personalities on your way out to the parking lot.

733
00:58:02,766 --> 00:58:05,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh... Let's see, let's see.

734
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:07,790
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, be sure to listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

735
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:08,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, good point.

736
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,271

[SPEAKER_20]: Every day.

739
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:11,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Every second.

00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:17,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Visit the Live 365 page for more info, and a direct link goes to the station site.

741
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:22,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, if you know me well, you know I like whoring out SCK, so here goes nothing.

742
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:28,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he whores out, continues to whore out, the Friday, November 15th launch date of SoCalKicks.com version 5.0.

743
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:29,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

746
00:58:32,265 --> 00:58:34,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if we have anything on these different pages yet.

747
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:38,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, it just says under construction.

748
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:40,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Under construction.

749
00:58:41,372 --> 00:58:42,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here's what it says for chat.

750
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:43,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Under construction.

751
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:43,834
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait.

752
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:46,857
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, I just won't make it pretty and just say what's needed.

753
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:52,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The channel is Orange Lounge and can be found on any other irc.otherside.net server such as irc.acons.org and others.

754
00:58:52,521 --> 00:58:52,942

00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:03,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on, SoCalKicks, I know you know who's on CAST.

761
00:59:03,426 --> 00:59:03,926
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:07,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, music.

00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:08,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

765
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:09,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Links.

766
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Under Construction, but here's your first link.

767
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:14,671
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, Sackbit Monty needs to be on there.

768
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:16,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's the link to SoCalKicks.

769
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:21,955
[SPEAKER_11]: In the upcoming, we will have... Might I add, that's one giant link banner.

770
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:25,072
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just have to make, like, one's just as big.

771
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:25,552
[SPEAKER_20]: It's huge!

772
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:33,756
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like an orange dropped on a toothpick!

773
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:40,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, so the site is very pretty, and we appreciate DSCS and all his hard work.

774
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So, a big kisses from all of us to DSCS.

And, uh...

776
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:53,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be sure you're involved in any future Twinkie eating competitions.

777
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you two can eat out of Twinkie.

778
00:59:57,971 --> 01:00:01,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I have to scream out his slogan.

779
01:00:01,874 --> 01:00:06,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we scream it out in agony, ecstasy, pain?

780
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:08,017
[SPEAKER_08]: How should we scream out his slogan?

781
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:14,801
[SPEAKER_18]: S-C-K-A-R-B-L-I-S-H-I-S Ultimate Tack!

01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:32,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, in rave style.

01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:39,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

794
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.

795
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:40,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it that way.

796
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go find my glow sticks real fast.

797
01:00:44,523 --> 01:00:45,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I can come back and do this in rave style.

798
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:47,265
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to know where your glow sticks are.

799
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man, oh, did you hear, man?

800
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,510
[SPEAKER_07]: SDK accomplished his ultimate evolution just now.

01:01:04,113 --> 01:01:04,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah.

803
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:07,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just out of that.

804
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:09,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

805
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:12,355

01:01:20,957 --> 01:01:21,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Move, Orange Lounge.

811
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:34,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's take another quick break.

812
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so Rob can go put his glow sticks away.

813
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:37,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to come back.

814
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:44,370
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to be a quick break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to talk about... We're going to do Happy Hopper in this break.

815
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,131
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do Silhouette of My Mind in this break.

816
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:46,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

817
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:49,311
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going from extremes here.

818
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're going from very happy to very wrist-slitting-ish.

819
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:54,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we're going to go the other way around.

820
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:55,993
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go from wrist-slitting to happy.

821
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:58,354
[SPEAKER_20]: I look as the blood splashes upon the...

822
01:01:59,555 --> 01:02:00,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackness of my soul.

823
01:02:00,576 --> 01:02:00,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I still.

824
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:01,237

850
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:44,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember that the reason why I said F you to Baltimore was because they were the lowest ranked on the list of what cities are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

851

[SPEAKER_08]: So...

876
01:07:56,104 --> 01:07:57,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the FUs of the week, shall we?

877
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:00,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We just talked about the FUs of the week.

878
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:02,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, we're going to talk about the FUs of the week.

879
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about how we don't play... Well, I'm sorry, Jamie has to kick it off.

880
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll reference what I said later.

881
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:10,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

882
01:08:10,096 --> 01:08:11,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me don't play that.

883
01:08:11,937 --> 01:08:13,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you've got to start it off.

884
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:14,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your baby.

885
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:16,741
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your little crack-infested baby.

886
01:08:17,101 --> 01:08:18,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Crack-infested baby?

887
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:22,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Never do a drug named after part of your own ass.

888
01:08:25,549 --> 01:08:27,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Waka Laka gives you wings, what?

889
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:27,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Wee!

890
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:36,053
[SPEAKER_08]: It is that time of the show, ladies and gentlemen, where Jamie and the rest of us all get pissed off as hell, and we give our FUs of the week!

891
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:39,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

892
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:40,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it!

893
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:41,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, FUs of the week.

894
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:53,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, first one is gonna go, and this wasn't anything anyone could control, so I'm saying fuck you to fate for fucking with us in the fourth mix machine yesterday at Shaft.

895
01:08:55,505 --> 01:09:00,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn you all to hell!

896
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:14,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Another one goes toward... Fuck you to hurting at the end of the day and thank you to Vicodin.

897
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:17,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to sleeping for 13 and a half hours.

898
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:22,185
[SPEAKER_20]: Sleep feels good, though.

899
01:09:23,386 --> 01:09:24,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you, too.

900
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:27,528
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

901
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:29,989
[SPEAKER_19]: I really am not filled with that in the shakes today.

902
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you really Jamie, or are you an imposter?

903
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel good.

904
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:38,002
[SPEAKER_20]: That fucking sucks!

905
01:09:38,662 --> 01:09:45,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to my good mood, dammit, because I can't be angsty enough to go off without something enough to just be super pissed.

906
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:47,748
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have to be super pissed to be ready to kill people, too.

907
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:48,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, oh.

908
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:51,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I can't do that either.

909
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:51,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.

910
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:52,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

911
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:55,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so much for that.

912
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:56,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to hear that.

913
01:09:56,833 --> 01:10:01,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, after 19 weeks of being pissed off, it's time for Jamie to be in a loving, sharing mood, right?

914
01:10:01,756 --> 01:10:02,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck that!

915
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:03,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

916
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:04,938
[SPEAKER_17]: That pisses me the hell... Okay.

917
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:09,902
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's talk to Loki and see what his fuck you of the week is.

918
01:10:11,063 --> 01:10:12,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you of the week?

919
01:10:12,144 --> 01:10:15,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, fuck you of the week, that's definitely for sure.

920
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:17,128
[SPEAKER_11]: First one goes to my cold.

921
01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:21,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like having a cold, and it snuck up on me on Friday, and that really sucked.

922
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:25,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably all the rain's fault, so F you to the rain, even though I like rain.

923
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:28,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you for my battery being dead this morning in my car.

924
01:10:28,877 --> 01:10:31,859
[SPEAKER_11]: At least it works now, I think, so that's cool.

925
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:37,664
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Cigaru, because I hate that song, and they played it way too many times at the tournament yesterday.

926
01:10:39,225 --> 01:10:42,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, a big cute FU to something we're going to be covering in just a little bit.

927
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Super Eurobeat, the new song that's going to be on GDR Extreme.

928
01:10:48,913 --> 01:10:51,475
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the most evil things on the face of the earth.

929
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,197
[SPEAKER_11]: When you add Naoki with B4U...

930
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very scared and concerned about that one.

931
01:10:59,162 --> 01:11:01,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I show great concern for this new song.

932
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:13,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, let's see what else we got here.

933
01:11:14,295 --> 01:11:20,299
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to my pads for being faulty sometimes and me constantly having to prepare them.

934
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:34,088
[SPEAKER_11]: F you for myself for getting shocked by my stereo numerous times while I was putting wires to it because I'm an idiot and I was tired and didn't unplug it when I was hooking up wires and just kept going, ow, ow, ow, ow.

935
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:35,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

936
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:36,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

937
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:56,142
[SPEAKER_11]: FU for people not talking in chatrooms enough because I'm bored at work and I read the forums too fast and I go through about eight forums and no one's talking about anything new.

938
01:11:56,622 --> 01:11:57,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So that pisses me off.

939
01:11:58,603 --> 01:12:00,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm running out of things.

940
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:02,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm probably still tired from yesterday.

941
01:12:02,345 --> 01:12:03,446
[SPEAKER_11]: FU for me being tired.

942
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:04,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, wait.

943
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's something.

944
01:12:05,293 --> 01:12:05,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

945
01:12:05,773 --> 01:12:06,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming to me.

946
01:12:06,453 --> 01:12:07,074
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming to me.

947
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:10,974
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

948
01:12:12,555 --> 01:12:17,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Thinking there's something I remember seeing yesterday that I was going to do an FU about, but I can't remember what it was.

949
01:12:18,556 --> 01:12:18,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Dammit.

950
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:20,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, fuck that.

951
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:21,696
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to you, Loki.

952
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:21,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

953
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:24,317
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, my FU of the week.

954
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:25,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back.

955
01:12:26,397 --> 01:12:26,817
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back.

956
01:12:27,318 --> 01:12:29,358
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week goes to myself.

957
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:46,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday during the Orange Lounge broadcast, yesterday during the Orange Lounge live broadcast we were doing live from Shaft, we did some music breaks so that Loki and whoever was on air could actually have a break to get up and go out and do something.

958
01:12:47,223 --> 01:12:51,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the CDs that I used during the break was Dance Mania 20.

959
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:57,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So unfortunately yesterday I unknowingly played Bye Bye Baby Balloon on this station.

960
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:58,413
[SPEAKER_20]: You bitch!

961
01:13:00,405 --> 01:13:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So a big fuck you to me for breaking that rule that I put down weeks and weeks ago when Bye Bye Baby Balloon was voted by the listless process as the worst Bomani song next to Let Them Move.

962
01:13:11,255 --> 01:13:12,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it yesterday.

963
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:13,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did I play it, I played the full version.

964
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:21,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play Dirty yesterday, however I have in the past.

965
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,406
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a fuck you.

966
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:22,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I have one.

967
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:24,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

968
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:24,869
[SPEAKER_19]: I have one.

969
01:13:24,889 --> 01:13:27,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we have to go back to your music.

970
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:28,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, of course.

971
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:33,177
[SPEAKER_20]: My fuck you goes toward that damn song for finally growing on me.

972
01:13:33,277 --> 01:13:34,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

973
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:37,902
[SPEAKER_20]: I found myself at work with that song stuck in my head.

974
01:13:37,942 --> 01:13:38,283
[SPEAKER_06]: What song?

975
01:13:38,323 --> 01:13:39,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Fucking Dirty.

976
01:13:41,225 --> 01:13:42,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pointing at you, Jamie.

977
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:44,207
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you.

978
01:13:44,227 --> 01:13:45,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop pointing at me.

979
01:13:45,969 --> 01:13:47,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody yell at Rob.

980
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:48,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Nini.

981
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,852
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

982
01:13:49,872 --> 01:13:52,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Did Loki, oh, Loki, you thought he'd rep you?

983
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:58,068
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

984
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:01,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is a general FU.

985
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:03,212
[SPEAKER_11]: FU do speed mixes.

986
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,613
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the dumbest things in the face of the earth.

987
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate everybody that does speed mixes of any sort.

988
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:12,818
[SPEAKER_11]: This goes with Jenny Rom and the Zippers.

989
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate them all.

990
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate them all.

991
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,422
[SPEAKER_08]: JB is walking here right now.

992
01:14:17,502 --> 01:14:17,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

993
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:19,463
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to walk a lock on your ass.

994
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:19,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

995
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:20,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, no.

996
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:22,385
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they've done some slower stuff.

997
01:14:22,405 --> 01:14:23,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.

998
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:23,966
[SPEAKER_11]: But I hate... I hate...

999
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,750
[SPEAKER_11]: B-Mixes, I hate them to death!

1000
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:39,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now, okay, I'll give credit to, you know, Jenny Ranma's stuff because some of her stuff is good, I do like it, you know, but I dislike, for instance, we just heard the Venus, um, what was it, uh, you can leave me alone.

1001
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:41,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we just heard it like an hour ago.

1002
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:43,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, okay?

1003
01:14:44,228 --> 01:14:44,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So we heard it.

1004
01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:46,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like shit, okay?

1005
01:14:46,469 --> 01:14:49,170
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just, just like, okay, I've heard one more time.

1006
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,550
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like shit.

1007
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:53,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard, like, I don't know, there's a bunch of stuff I've heard.

1008
01:14:53,971 --> 01:14:55,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All of it sounds like crap.

1009
01:14:55,732 --> 01:15:01,374
[SPEAKER_11]: You just speed it up and have some guy cover it because you can't pay the artist royalty fees, and it sounds like shit.

1010
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:03,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the comic goes, whew, it's fast.

1011
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:07,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's put it in our next New York Stream Super Duper Mix.

1012
01:15:08,057 --> 01:15:11,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, people play it and go, damn, this is tiring.

1013
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:12,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I dislike it.

1014
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:13,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.

1015
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:14,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And living in America sucks ass.

1016
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, DDR isn't just a power, it's a super-duper power.

1017
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:20,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh, God.

1018
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:23,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Stupid, freaking... Wow.

1019
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:26,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to Naoki, because... I don't want to say that.

1020
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:30,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to freaking Naoki Jules, because he's not putting anything good in there.

1021
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:32,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is he just speaking Japanese?

1022
01:15:33,012 --> 01:15:34,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is he Japanese or something?

1023
01:15:34,874 --> 01:15:37,295
[SPEAKER_11]: He can't speak English like everybody else in the face here.

1024
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So find out what this fuck is.

1025
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:45,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, oh, and here's another one.

1026
01:15:45,899 --> 01:15:48,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, since I'm going off on the EDR extreme.

1027
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,100
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Loki show, ladies and gentlemen.

1028
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:50,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1029
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:54,342
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell kind of... They need to come up with some better names for the songs.

1030
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:56,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have Paranoia Survivor Max.

1031
01:15:58,523 --> 01:15:59,103
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

1032
01:15:59,123 --> 01:16:01,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on, name it something else.

1033
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:03,324
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

1034
01:16:03,364 --> 01:16:04,765
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the deal with milk?

1035
01:16:05,325 --> 01:16:05,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

1036
01:16:07,919 --> 01:16:08,219
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1037
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

1038
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:12,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1039
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:14,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finished.

1040
01:16:14,782 --> 01:16:17,944
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat room is yelling at you, Loki.

1041
01:16:17,964 --> 01:16:19,565
[SPEAKER_08]: They're half with you and half against you.

1042
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:23,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Half of them are with you and half of them are against you.

1043
01:16:23,706 --> 01:16:24,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dear God.

1044
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we ever going to get to the chat rooms?

1045
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:29,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck the chat rooms.

1046
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:30,289
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

1047
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:31,490
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you guys, so forget it.

1048
01:16:32,765 --> 01:16:34,887
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, speak mixes are okay.

1049
01:16:35,867 --> 01:16:37,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them suck ass.

1050
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:43,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Major fuckers go to Politary for still being alive.

1051
01:16:43,573 --> 01:16:49,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Woman, I've been listening to Politary now, unfortunately, for days.

1052
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:51,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it keeps coming up.

1053
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:55,270
[SPEAKER_20]: I say that we have a one-week ban of Politary from our radio show.

1054
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're going to ban Politary from the radio show?

1055
01:16:57,872 --> 01:16:58,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Just for a week.

1056
01:16:58,793 --> 01:16:59,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for a week?

1057
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:03,016
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some songs that have good music in them that are just ruined by her voice.

1058
01:17:03,257 --> 01:17:03,657
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1059
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:04,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1060
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:10,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting tomorrow, Orange Lounge has banned Politary from its playlist completely.

1061
01:17:10,882 --> 01:17:12,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I have another proposition.

1062
01:17:12,704 --> 01:17:14,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I am offering a $500 bounty for Politary.

1063
01:17:18,528 --> 01:17:18,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead.

1064
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,470
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, you can't kill her.

1065
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:23,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Just killing is wrong.

1066
01:17:23,412 --> 01:17:24,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, how about this?

1067
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:26,094
[SPEAKER_08]: $500 for her to go mute.

1068
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:28,716
[SPEAKER_20]: Shove, like, acid down her throat?

1069
01:17:28,736 --> 01:17:29,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Shove a Twinkie down her throat.

1070
01:17:29,737 --> 01:17:31,838
[SPEAKER_20]: A fried Twinkie.

1071
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:35,441
[SPEAKER_08]: $500 for a super hot fried Twinkie shoved down Voluntary's throat.

1072
01:17:35,461 --> 01:17:36,482
[SPEAKER_20]: To dissolve her larynx.

1073
01:17:37,102 --> 01:17:38,904
[SPEAKER_20]: And she can't sing anymore.

1074
01:17:40,009 --> 01:17:44,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I want her tongue sent to me in a plastic baggie through the mail.

1075
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:49,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Make sure that you vacuum seal it so that it stays fresh so we can see it still twitch.

1076
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:52,514
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god!

1077
01:17:53,054 --> 01:17:54,975
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had sex, we've had violence.

1078
01:17:58,276 --> 01:17:59,977
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had sex in the first hour of this show.

1079
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:03,819
[SPEAKER_09]: We have violence right now and probably drugs before it's all over.

1080
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I had my Vicodin already.

1081
01:18:05,539 --> 01:18:07,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge goes to hell tonight.

1082
01:18:09,104 --> 01:18:11,486
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to hell in a hat and basket and you're all coming with us.

1083
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I get to the chatroom FUs?

1084
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:14,728
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1085
01:18:14,748 --> 01:18:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, sure.

1086
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:16,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

1087
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,031
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to give the chatroom special music today.

1088
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:21,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to give them something to yell about.

1089
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:23,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they can all do an FU to Loki.

1090
01:18:23,154 --> 01:18:25,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, Orange Beanie's a little mad about Politary.

1091
01:18:26,937 --> 01:18:28,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what music do you need?

1092
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I'm going to have to say that, um... Oh, shoot, what else was one of my, uh...

1093
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:37,665
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.

1094
01:18:37,685 --> 01:18:44,309
[SPEAKER_11]: to Scandia for having their party room window covered up by blue paint or something because I couldn't see the freaking machine.

1095
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:46,651
[SPEAKER_08]: But Scandia rules, so we'll forgive them this one time.

1096
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, yes, Orange Lounge Vice City tonight.

1097
01:18:50,173 --> 01:18:51,394
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're being called.

1098
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:53,215
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, oh, F.U.

1099
01:18:53,235 --> 01:18:59,259
[SPEAKER_11]: to Vice City because I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

1100
01:18:59,499 --> 01:19:01,541
[SPEAKER_11]: She gets in my car, she takes money.

1101
01:19:01,961 --> 01:19:02,842
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1102
01:19:03,022 --> 01:19:04,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That's your sound clip from now on.

1103
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:08,504
[SPEAKER_09]: For the life of me, I can't get the hooker to have sex with me.

1104
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:13,026
[SPEAKER_20]: This is now chat room fuck you time, so Rob, go at it.

1105
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:15,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, okay.

1106
01:19:16,847 --> 01:19:18,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I had special music for them, that's okay.

1107
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:21,188
[SPEAKER_20]: This one's all nice and fast and angsty.

1108
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:22,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Speed mixy, if you will.

1109
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:26,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, okay, I like KOGG3, okay?

1110
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:30,951
[SPEAKER_11]: They kick ass, and so does RedMonsterHyper, or whatever that is.

1111
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:34,713
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, here we go.

1112
01:19:35,374 --> 01:19:40,098
[SPEAKER_08]: DSCS SoCalKick says, F you to the rain and cold that made them almost sick-ass Loki sounds.

1113
01:19:40,538 --> 01:19:42,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, Owen, for not wanting to go to the movies on Monday.

1114
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:49,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, Char Plus Parents, these are all people we don't know, for not letting me go over this weekend in FU time, because there isn't enough of it.

1115
01:19:49,527 --> 01:19:59,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to beta test STK Max 5.0 in the next two to three days, finish my special art project by Wednesday, or get an F on it, and make an avid side of my ass before December 7th.

1116
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:03,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to Loki, tell him to get him on fucking AIM, because I'm home all effing day.

1117
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:10,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave, I have to give Dave special music.

1118
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:12,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what Dave's FU song was, though.

1119
01:20:12,137 --> 01:20:13,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody remember Dave's FU song?

1120
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:16,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to play this song for Dave.

1121
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:19,269
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll like it.

1122
01:20:20,129 --> 01:20:23,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave says, F you Tigger for being so freaking good.

1123
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:25,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you have to own every song?

1124
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:29,835
[SPEAKER_08]: He beat me in the quarterfinals on the Can't Stop Falling in Love speed mix by 31 greats.

1125
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:31,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I got 40 out of 444.

1126
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:32,317
[SPEAKER_08]: He got 9.

1127
01:20:32,617 --> 01:20:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I came in fifth though.

1128
01:20:34,799 --> 01:20:39,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Un-fuck the weekend for being three days long, but fuck RyRy's parents for not trusting her with me.

1129
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a little intense there.

1130
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:43,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I shouldn't have read that out loud.

1131
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:44,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1132
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:46,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading without thinking.

1133
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:46,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1134
01:20:46,686 --> 01:20:50,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope she's not listening with her speakers turned up.

1135
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:51,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody's in trouble.

1136
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:52,409
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1137
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:52,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

1138
01:20:55,511 --> 01:20:58,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the rest of the chatroom.

1139
01:21:01,495 --> 01:21:02,495
[SPEAKER_08]: God, he's got too many.

1140
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:03,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm only doing part of these.

1141
01:21:05,488 --> 01:21:23,866
[SPEAKER_08]: F you for not understanding a single word of the Shaft stuff tonight F every female on this planet F celebrate night for fucking me up on Oni F the entire CBS DDR coverage which we've got to talk about before the show's over F those stupid dancers who won PS2 and pads on that and F Loki because he asked for it

1142
01:21:29,104 --> 01:21:36,429
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus, F. Roulette, he expects something non-rave style when he does improv freestyle, or something like Sugaru for improv.

1143
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:37,810
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for you, Loki.

1144
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,331
[SPEAKER_08]: In status, we all know he got Nori Nori Nori.

1145
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:43,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill, I still should get an award for most incongruous routine.

1146
01:21:44,013 --> 01:21:45,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, Nori Nori Nori.

1147
01:21:47,315 --> 01:21:52,839
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Konami, F you to Kakumei Encore Stage because I failed on the 6th step.

1148
01:21:55,229 --> 01:21:57,510
[SPEAKER_08]: SoCalKicks, I missed a part and I closed the window.

1149
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:57,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1150
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:58,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Resend it to me.

1151
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read it.

1152
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:04,532
[SPEAKER_08]: JB says, F you to anyone who doesn't like Hello Panda cookies.

1153
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:06,052
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be stabbed with sporks.

1154
01:22:07,373 --> 01:22:10,053
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to hurting after the turning and burning myself in the deep fryer.

1155
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:12,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Hello Panda cookies.

1156
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:16,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say Politary can sing and Naoki can't compose.

1157
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:22,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to add that, JB, you know, kind of that was your fault since you're deep frying everything that you can get your hands on.

1158
01:22:24,066 --> 01:22:27,070
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty entertaining watching him deep fry pretty much everything.

1159
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:34,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the most popular things that was being deep fried yesterday, other than the Twinkies, had to have been the candy corn.

1160
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,121
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, you're very welcome.

1161
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,725
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope you enjoyed your Hello Kitty Yang Yangs.

1162
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:46,625
[SPEAKER_08]: DDRholic, oh, I love DDRholic, she's so cool.

1163
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:50,767
[SPEAKER_08]: FU for there not being such anything as Guys Gone Wild videos.

1164
01:22:51,167 --> 01:22:52,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Amen to that.

1165
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:53,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Go on, girl.

1166
01:22:53,888 --> 01:23:01,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, they did a thing, like, they did Guys Gone Wild, like a promo for that on the guy show, or the man show.

1167
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,772
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't make a real one.

1168
01:23:04,152 --> 01:23:06,954
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to Girls Gone Wild, there should be a Guys Gone Wild series.

1169
01:23:09,497 --> 01:23:16,599
[SPEAKER_08]: EOSFBB says, wow, fuck you.

1170
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:22,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little, a little racist.

1171
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:23,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to read that on the air.

1172
01:23:23,802 --> 01:23:26,423
[SPEAKER_08]: So he says China Power, so we'll leave it at that.

1173
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:34,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Fitpower says, my FU of the week goes to the official Animal Crossing site because they've taken down the Donkey Kong Jr.

1174
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:41,143
[SPEAKER_08]: NES game and it's now replaced with Clu Clu Land D. Now I can't get Donkey Kong Jr.

1175
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:41,923
[SPEAKER_08]: in my town now.

1176
01:23:42,503 --> 01:23:50,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Also FU to Wrapping Paper because I like to keep my DVD covers in excellent condition and the Wrapping Paper took about 45 minutes to get off because of all the extra tape they put on it.

1177
01:23:51,846 --> 01:23:52,686
[SPEAKER_20]: I have another FU.

1178
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,247
[SPEAKER_08]: You've hit your quota for the night.

1179
01:23:57,682 --> 01:23:59,023
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the angsty happy bunny.

1180
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:05,949
[SPEAKER_20]: My fuck you of the week goes to my fiancee, Dan, for hitting Mallory in the head with the bug net.

1181
01:24:06,169 --> 01:24:08,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Mallory is a bitch and she needs to die.

1182
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:10,813
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs to burn in Animal Crossing hell.

1183
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:13,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Animal Crossing hell and burn, Mallory.

1184
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you.

1185
01:24:15,257 --> 01:24:22,203
[SPEAKER_20]: And also to our town lesbian, Dina, because she went ahead and took care of her errand myself just because it was a day late.

1186
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:28,754
[SPEAKER_20]: and, and, and, and, and Fuck You to, um, well, you know what?

1187
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:35,859
[SPEAKER_20]: I need people to play Phantasy Star with, so if anyone has Phantasy Star Online and a broadband thingy for the GameCube, let me know, or if not, then Fuck You.

1188
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I want to play it with you.

1189
01:24:39,102 --> 01:24:41,403
[SPEAKER_08]: SoCalKick says F you to whoever hates on Loki.

1190
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:42,304
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't get my music.

1191
01:24:42,324 --> 01:24:43,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, you're right, he doesn't get your music.

1192
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,486
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets something even better.

1193
01:24:47,027 --> 01:24:52,111
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to whoever hates on Loki, because that was the best rant-a-thon I've heard in ages.

1194
01:24:55,076 --> 01:24:58,977
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus, Politaris, sounds like Yoko Ono with laryngitis.

1195
01:25:00,918 --> 01:25:04,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Gwen says F you to me because I wasn't supposed to say that female one on the air.

1196
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:05,499
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1197
01:25:06,919 --> 01:25:11,260
[SPEAKER_08]: EOSFVB says F you to me for being quote unquote racist.

1198
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I just kind of used some kind of words I don't want to say on the air.

1199
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of bad.

1200
01:25:18,561 --> 01:25:20,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And DDR, it's on a happy note.

1201
01:25:20,302 --> 01:25:21,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the kudos, Rob and Jamie.

1202
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:30,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to whoever took my signed tape, because I won the season 10 for a fourth time.

1203
01:25:31,013 --> 01:25:34,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to watch my bootleg DVD, which has really bad subtitles.

1204
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:36,196
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

1205
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:36,857
[SPEAKER_07]: F that.

1206
01:25:38,117 --> 01:25:39,278
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck this song.

1207
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:41,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, F this song.

1208
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,082
[SPEAKER_20]: One, two, three, four, this song really sucks.

1209
01:25:45,722 --> 01:25:49,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I need to find my copy of Instant Love, because I don't know where it is.

1210
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,226
[SPEAKER_20]: It's on one of the old pre-shows, too.

1211
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:52,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

1212
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:56,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

1213
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:27,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

1214
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

1215
01:26:31,129 --> 01:26:33,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The object will come down from the top.

1216
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:36,872
[SPEAKER_04]: When it hits the red line, push the button.

1217
01:26:38,433 --> 01:26:41,475
[SPEAKER_04]: When it hits the red line, turn the table.

1218
01:26:42,175 --> 01:26:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it?

1219
01:26:43,236 --> 01:26:44,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's practice.

1220
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1221
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:46,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's for all the keys and the turntable.

1222
01:27:46,326 --> 01:27:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, but you can do it.

1223
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:51,512
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the ball, it's the ball.

1224
01:27:51,612 --> 01:27:53,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the ball, it's the ball.

1225
01:27:53,574 --> 01:27:55,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the ball, it's the ball.

1226
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:19,752

01:33:10,854 --> 01:33:11,937
Thank you for watching!

1233
01:34:21,492 --> 01:34:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.

1234
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good place to listen to the music.

1235
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:30,590
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1236
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,711
[SPEAKER_08]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1237
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:36,533
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know Wesley Willis, maybe you should.

1238
01:34:37,113 --> 01:34:39,034
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where that little promo comes from.

1239
01:34:39,574 --> 01:34:46,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a joke, and I don't even think it was really something I ever intended on putting into the station rotation, but we need a new promo, so what can I say?

1240
01:34:47,037 --> 01:34:48,177
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll make more then.

1241
01:34:48,237 --> 01:34:50,358
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make more.

1242
01:34:50,898 --> 01:34:55,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that tournament's over, we can sometime this week get you guys over and we'll work on more promos.

1243
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:55,760
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.

1244
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:57,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

1245
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble Bobble Techno Song

1246
01:35:15,299 --> 01:35:17,100
[SPEAKER_20]: It was one of the Overclocked remixes.

1247
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,720
[SPEAKER_08]: So probably Overclocked.org?

1248
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:19,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1249
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:21,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And search for... Should be Overclocked.org, it's gonna be.

1250
01:35:21,781 --> 01:35:23,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Search for Bubble Bobble and you'll probably find it.

1251
01:35:23,722 --> 01:35:31,145
[SPEAKER_11]: All I gotta say is, you know, I've been, you know, especially nowadays, you know, I'm totally browsing the internet while I'm working.

1252
01:35:31,886 --> 01:35:33,568
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Final Fantasy

1253
01:35:48,247 --> 01:35:52,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's actually done some stuff for Final Fantasy 7.

1254
01:35:52,749 --> 01:35:55,930
[SPEAKER_11]: He did this one that's called Strings Machine.

1255
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:57,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just an awesome trance.

1256
01:35:57,471 --> 01:35:59,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this guy should be doing professional stuff.

1257
01:35:59,912 --> 01:36:01,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know why he's not.

1258
01:36:01,973 --> 01:36:04,194
[SPEAKER_11]: The ones to check out are definitely Strings Machine.

1259
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:08,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there's also one that's a Geneva trance remix.

1260
01:36:08,437 --> 01:36:09,298
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really cool.

1261
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:11,019
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a few other ones.

1262
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Metalroid is another good one to check out.

1263
01:36:13,722 --> 01:36:15,964
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Metroid-themed remix.

1264
01:36:16,024 --> 01:36:18,005
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of hard rock, which is pretty cool.

1265
01:36:18,025 --> 01:36:19,126
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that URL one more time?

1266
01:36:19,647 --> 01:36:23,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's remix.overclocked.org.

1267
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:24,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1268
01:36:24,551 --> 01:36:24,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay.

1269
01:36:24,991 --> 01:36:25,351
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

1270
01:36:25,391 --> 01:36:25,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Remix.overclocked.

1271
01:36:26,312 --> 01:36:26,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Good stuff.

1272
01:36:27,413 --> 01:36:29,575
[SPEAKER_20]: If you just do a web search for overclocked, you'll find it.

1273
01:36:30,086 --> 01:36:33,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you might want to do Overclock Remix, otherwise you're going to get a bunch of sites.

1274
01:36:34,207 --> 01:36:35,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't clock me.

1275
01:36:35,647 --> 01:36:38,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's talk about... We've got about 20 minutes left in the show.

1276
01:36:38,748 --> 01:36:40,708
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got about a bunch of Imani news to cram in.

1277
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:44,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But speaking of time left in the show, this is an announcement we haven't made yet during the show.

1278
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:46,629
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably should have opened the show saying it.

1279
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:54,331
[SPEAKER_08]: But starting next week with episode 20, Orange Lounge season number two debuts.

1280
01:36:54,631 --> 01:36:55,571
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole new season.

1281
01:36:56,363 --> 01:37:03,932
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I'm concerned, the past 21 shows or however many we did, because we had a couple half shows in there, they've all been leading up to next week.

1282
01:37:03,953 --> 01:37:05,995
[SPEAKER_08]: This has all been practice.

1283
01:37:06,776 --> 01:37:09,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Because next week we're taking Orange Lounge to three hours.

1284
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: A three hour tour.

1285
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:13,644
[SPEAKER_08]: 3-Hour Treatment

1286
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:47,264
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we should be here when Rob makes the intro, or maybe someone should hook me up with a particular program that we need to let somebody else make an intro.

1287
01:37:48,525 --> 01:37:49,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear it now.

1288
01:37:49,966 --> 01:37:53,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, for the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me.

1289
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for giving that to me once again nice and clear.

1290
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,890
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll make editing a lot easier.

1291
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:58,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1292
01:38:00,112 --> 01:38:01,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how it's going to go.

1293
01:38:01,193 --> 01:38:03,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to go 6.30 to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.

1294
01:38:03,995 --> 01:38:10,340
[SPEAKER_08]: The replays will still be 7 o'clock on Monday and 2 o'clock on Thursday for the time being.

1295
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,301
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as I get to be an angsty happy bunny.

1296
01:38:12,501 --> 01:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, as always.

1297
01:38:14,103 --> 01:38:16,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy, or angsty, or both.

1298
01:38:16,805 --> 01:38:19,687
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty much all you need to know.

1299
01:38:19,807 --> 01:38:21,128
[SPEAKER_08]: New season starts next week.

1300
01:38:21,168 --> 01:38:23,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.

1301
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:24,651
[SPEAKER_20]: Go Joe!

1302
01:38:26,169 --> 01:38:27,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Bomani News this week.

1303
01:38:27,911 --> 01:38:30,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Way back to Monday, day after we did this show.

1304
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:37,344
[SPEAKER_08]: CBS, on the early show, did a little DDR promotion on it.

1305
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:43,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It was basically one gigantic infomercial for DDR where everybody did not know shit.

1306
01:38:45,143 --> 01:38:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1307
01:38:46,184 --> 01:38:47,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be the best way to describe it.

1308
01:38:47,685 --> 01:38:52,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like taking the audience members from an infomercial and having them do the infomercial.

1309
01:38:52,069 --> 01:38:52,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what they did, okay?

1310
01:38:52,949 --> 01:38:58,774
[SPEAKER_11]: They got this local dance school to come down there, and they had these people that I guess were from some dance school, from what it looked like.

1311
01:38:59,194 --> 01:39:00,575
[SPEAKER_11]: A local school, everything.

1312
01:39:00,836 --> 01:39:01,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were playing DDR.

1313
01:39:01,917 --> 01:39:03,638
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dance School of Jennifer Lopez.

1314
01:39:03,978 --> 01:39:05,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, it was pretty bad.

1315
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, no one really knew what they were doing.

1316
01:39:07,801 --> 01:39:10,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Watching, like, newbie people playing DDR USA.

1317
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:12,705
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they had three machines set up there.

1318
01:39:13,366 --> 01:39:13,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

1319
01:39:14,446 --> 01:39:18,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, speaking of the machine setup, this pissed me off.

1320
01:39:18,488 --> 01:39:22,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I get angry about it, but I just find it kind of irritating.

1321
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:26,373
[SPEAKER_08]: They had Max 2 machines with USA banners on them.

1322
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:32,875
[SPEAKER_08]: That really strikes a bad chord with me.

1323
01:39:32,915 --> 01:39:36,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like, Konami, why do you have to lie?

1324
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just give us a new mix?

1325
01:39:39,203 --> 01:39:40,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's interesting.

1326
01:39:40,785 --> 01:39:41,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you not notice that?

1327
01:39:41,827 --> 01:39:42,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not notice that.

1328
01:39:42,387 --> 01:39:46,193
[SPEAKER_08]: There was freeze arrows, and one of the songs being played was Japan.

1329
01:39:47,934 --> 01:39:50,277
[SPEAKER_08]: They had Max 2... Matsuri Japan.

1330
01:39:50,357 --> 01:39:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Matsuri Japan.

1331
01:39:51,858 --> 01:39:54,361
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the machines, the one in the middle was a USA machine.

1332
01:39:54,381 --> 01:39:56,703
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that the CBS host played on, that was a USA machine.

1333
01:39:56,743 --> 01:39:59,065
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the two side machines were Max 2 machines.

1334
01:39:59,586 --> 01:40:08,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of like, you kind of feel like, you know, obviously for Joe Q public, those that don't know DDR very well, you know, it doesn't matter.

1335
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:09,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big deal.

1336
01:40:09,675 --> 01:40:09,896
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1337
01:40:11,898 --> 01:40:15,042
[SPEAKER_08]: You're kind of like, why are you misrepresenting the product here?

1338
01:40:15,462 --> 01:40:18,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, now the home version of Max is similar to Max 2.

1339
01:40:19,027 --> 01:40:20,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a lot of the cool things Max 2 does.

1340
01:40:20,829 --> 01:40:23,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Why didn't we just have somebody demo the home version of Max?

1341
01:40:24,113 --> 01:40:28,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did we have to invent these arcade machines that don't exist in the U.S.? ?

1342
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1343
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,640
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sit well with me.

1344
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Konami deserves a big slap on the wrist for that.

1345
01:40:35,481 --> 01:40:39,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one of the highlights I thought that was pretty interesting... Or whoever made that decision.

1346
01:40:39,202 --> 01:40:40,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Konami didn't make that decision.

1347
01:40:40,442 --> 01:40:48,485
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta love that they had a video game expert there who was talking about DDR and had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.

1348
01:40:49,825 --> 01:40:54,728
[SPEAKER_08]: All I could think of during that whole thing was, that guy's really gay.

1349
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:56,249
[SPEAKER_08]: He's really, really gay.

1350
01:40:56,309 --> 01:40:57,470
[SPEAKER_08]: He's saying gay things.

1351
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,771
[SPEAKER_08]: He's kind of talking gay.

1352
01:40:59,251 --> 01:41:01,172
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole segment's kind of gay.

1353
01:41:02,693 --> 01:41:04,374
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have, well, I don't know.

1354
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:05,375
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't see this.

1355
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:07,996
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sounding vaguely glad that I didn't.

1356
01:41:08,196 --> 01:41:09,357
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I was asleep.

1357
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:16,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being reminded that one reason they probably did the marquee switch was because imports are illegal.

1358
01:41:17,006 --> 01:41:17,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, true that.

1359
01:41:18,468 --> 01:41:24,015
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't get around the issue of you used an import machine, you just lied about it.

1360
01:41:24,975 --> 01:41:29,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, I mean... It's like, you know, okay, so they had trouble importing USA machines.

1361
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine, why didn't we promo Max USA?

1362
01:41:32,963 --> 01:41:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a damn good product.

1363
01:41:34,945 --> 01:41:36,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we should have been demoing.

1364
01:41:36,846 --> 01:41:46,035
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if they had, you know, maybe put out a PlayStation, a couple ignition pads, could have whored out Red Octane, or the official Konami pads, if Konami wants to whore out their own product.

1365
01:41:46,055 --> 01:41:48,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what they ended up doing is they had a drawing throughout the show, which...

1366
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:54,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Any, anyone watching the show really didn't give a rat's ass, it was only for the people actually at the show.

1367
01:41:54,299 --> 01:41:57,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, Super Contest, which has been pre-changed.

1368
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:12,023
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, um, two, uh, pretty shitty-ass, um, third-party dance performance pads and a, uh, what was that, PlayStation 2 and a DDR Max, uh, USA, uh, game, which is pretty, I mean, obviously that's pretty cool, you know, I'd love, you know, to win that if I was there.

1369
01:42:13,063 --> 01:42:15,624
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, they didn't really plug the game that much.

1370
01:42:15,824 --> 01:42:17,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they talked about, you know... No.

1371
01:42:18,005 --> 01:42:18,885
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they kind of didn't.

1372
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:31,130
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just kind of like, well, it's this new game that's sweeping the nation, and we're going to let these ignoramus dance students play it, and we're going to give one of them a fabulous prize of a home version game that we're going to just kind of show you.

1373
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:32,330
[SPEAKER_08]: The box art of it.

1374
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,151
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's funny?

1375
01:42:33,351 --> 01:42:33,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Konami...

1376
01:42:34,491 --> 01:42:35,031
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Max and Konomics

1377
01:43:05,391 --> 01:43:09,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, it might not have been Konami's fault.

1378
01:43:09,633 --> 01:43:11,794
[SPEAKER_08]: That whole switcheroo might not have been Konami's fault.

1379
01:43:12,314 --> 01:43:16,295
[SPEAKER_08]: It may have been CBS that made that decision, but F whoever did that, because that wasn't cool.

1380
01:43:16,615 --> 01:43:18,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever's decision it was, F them.

1381
01:43:19,757 --> 01:43:26,739
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw some pictures from it, and honestly, if you're going to show off something, it's like having a product.

1382
01:43:26,779 --> 01:43:29,780
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're going to show a product, you put it in the most positive light possible.

1383
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:31,421
[SPEAKER_20]: And you don't do it by putting...

1384
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:33,381
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1385
01:43:45,277 --> 01:43:46,318
[SPEAKER_03]: by a Catholic priest.

1386
01:43:47,238 --> 01:43:48,739
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the same difference.

1387
01:43:48,759 --> 01:43:52,982
[SPEAKER_20]: They have no idea how to do any of that, unless they've been reading confiscated material.

1388
01:43:54,102 --> 01:43:55,123
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know about some of them.

1389
01:43:56,043 --> 01:43:56,604
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I agree.

1390
01:43:56,704 --> 01:43:59,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why they didn't interview the dance expert.

1391
01:44:00,006 --> 01:44:01,987
[SPEAKER_08]: They had all these DDR people in.

1392
01:44:02,527 --> 01:44:05,209
[SPEAKER_08]: They flew 8-Ball out there, or he flew out there.

1393
01:44:05,229 --> 01:44:06,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell the arrangement was there.

1394
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:10,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But he was just kind of there in the background wearing a DDR Freak t-shirt.

1395
01:44:11,432 --> 01:44:14,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I... Didn't he make a comment during one of the clips?

1396
01:44:15,234 --> 01:44:19,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure, because I didn't exactly... I don't know what 8-Ball looks like, to be honest.

1397
01:44:19,415 --> 01:44:24,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought there was some guy that looked like he knew who he was talking about, and... He was the only guy wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

1398
01:44:25,078 --> 01:44:26,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that might have been him, then.

1399
01:44:26,098 --> 01:44:26,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1400
01:44:26,658 --> 01:44:27,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember.

1401
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:28,159
[SPEAKER_08]: If I remember correctly.

1402
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:30,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know either.

1403
01:44:31,302 --> 01:44:36,587
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, the dance school's kids should not have been there, and whoever that guy was wasn't Konami.

1404
01:44:36,607 --> 01:44:37,928
[SPEAKER_08]: He shouldn't have been there either.

1405
01:44:37,948 --> 01:44:38,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just put it this way, though.

1406
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:41,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Any publicity is good publicity.

1407
01:44:42,068 --> 01:44:45,110
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true, and you know, it's going to sell the game a little more.

1408
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:47,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we will get an arcade machine in the U.S.

1409
01:44:47,231 --> 01:45:01,300
[SPEAKER_20]: that's like Max 2, but... You know, we had the discussion about it, you know, it was me and... I don't remember who I was talking to about it, but we were making the discussion that now that the whole Endemiro suit's been settled, or is in process of settling, I'm not sure.

1410
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:09,905
[SPEAKER_20]: It should be, it's long over, whatever... It opens the door for a new mix, and I don't think that it's necessarily that Konami themselves have to do the work on it.

1411
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:17,799
[SPEAKER_20]: If they're allowing third parties to do the arcade releases, they could just as easily have a team set aside.

1412
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:21,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's just kind of like... And it will make so much money.

1413
01:45:22,001 --> 01:45:34,568
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were just in the know a little more, if we knew a little bit more about how all that operation works, what goes on inside Konami's roof, inside Konami's Japan roof, inside Konami of America's roof, it would probably make a lot more sense to us.

1414
01:45:34,608 --> 01:45:37,870
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't be so bitter about this game that we've wasted so much money on.

1415
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:39,151
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact is, we don't.

1416
01:45:39,651 --> 01:45:54,626
[SPEAKER_08]: and so we're just confused and we don't get but luckily at least the home releases are moving in the right direction by far so if they do end up doing a Max 2 in the US which I don't see why they wouldn't it'll probably kick a lot of ass so

1417
01:45:56,801 --> 01:45:58,122
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, CBS, yes.

1418
01:45:58,482 --> 01:46:01,844
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well, I guess we can talk about other, you know, smaller stuff.

1419
01:46:01,884 --> 01:46:03,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, any other news you know?

1420
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:08,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we've got, of course, you know, the eighth release of Characters for DDRPC.

1421
01:46:09,048 --> 01:46:11,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that anyone ever plays that game anymore.

1422
01:46:11,589 --> 01:46:16,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm sure there are certain people that play that game, but I know for me... I did see this morning.

1423
01:46:16,752 --> 01:46:19,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not, I did not play this, I don't play this game anymore.

1424
01:46:19,733 --> 01:46:21,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It crashes on my computer and whatever.

1425
01:46:21,594 --> 01:46:22,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a new character to be released?

1426
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:28,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The newest characters that we have, we've got two Latin people, I don't remember their names are, it doesn't really matter.

1427
01:46:29,138 --> 01:46:31,699
[SPEAKER_11]: But the most important one is Jason Enos.

1428
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:34,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Jason Enos is a playable character in DDR.

1429
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:40,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Which we all pretty much knew about ever since the game came out that he would be released at some point.

1430
01:46:40,103 --> 01:46:44,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what I said, his head is smaller than the rest of his body.

1431
01:46:44,665 --> 01:46:47,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Some graphic artist really fucked up on that.

1432
01:46:48,052 --> 01:46:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And his shirt looks like your shoes.

1433
01:46:49,473 --> 01:46:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.

1434
01:46:50,073 --> 01:46:50,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, I love the shirt.

1435
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:51,514
[SPEAKER_20]: I want that.

1436
01:46:51,554 --> 01:46:53,015
[SPEAKER_08]: The shirt was awesome.

1437
01:46:53,075 --> 01:46:54,196
[SPEAKER_08]: But he has a shrunken head.

1438
01:46:54,236 --> 01:46:55,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a real bummer.

1439
01:46:55,617 --> 01:46:56,478
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's still pretty neat.

1440
01:46:56,518 --> 01:46:56,938
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

1441
01:46:56,978 --> 01:46:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't play it in-game.

1442
01:46:57,978 --> 01:47:00,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it in-game yet, so he probably looks okay there.

1443
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,221
[SPEAKER_08]: But that little preview picture of him?

1444
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:04,603
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still really cool.

1445
01:47:04,743 --> 01:47:06,924
[SPEAKER_20]: You know that you've made it when you are in DDR.

1446
01:47:08,445 --> 01:47:11,827
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Konami's hoping that they release Kyle Snyder as a hidden character at some point.

1447
01:47:13,008 --> 01:47:14,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not going to happen.

1448
01:47:15,296 --> 01:47:16,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And a Sky character, yes.

1449
01:47:17,177 --> 01:47:18,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And a DarkSakura.

1450
01:47:19,178 --> 01:47:21,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky and DarkSakura should be a team that comes up.

1451
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:23,420
[SPEAKER_20]: But we'd have to have orange bats.

1452
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:27,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if they gave us orange bats, would you be a DDRPC character?

1453
01:47:27,202 --> 01:47:27,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I would.

1454
01:47:28,002 --> 01:47:32,805
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, someone let us know if you can, you know, make skins for the characters or something.

1455
01:47:32,865 --> 01:47:34,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Let us know if anyone's figured out how to hack it.

1456
01:47:34,726 --> 01:47:41,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Loki can be in DDRPC, too, and he'll kind of have that big trench coat of his on doing that whole Keanu Reeves thing.

1457
01:47:41,329 --> 01:47:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, I know DDR.

1458
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, I forgot my steps.

1459
01:47:46,672 --> 01:47:49,094
[SPEAKER_11]: A little insight there.

1460
01:47:51,336 --> 01:47:54,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, some stuff that's probably going to be announced.

1461
01:47:54,178 --> 01:47:58,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not positive it's going to be announced next week, but that's when it's scheduled to be announced.

1462
01:47:58,802 --> 01:47:59,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourney Mix 3.

1463
01:48:00,403 --> 01:48:02,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Tourney Mix 3 is coming up.

1464
01:48:02,345 --> 01:48:04,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this would be the sim news portion.

1465
01:48:04,246 --> 01:48:05,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, sim news, I guess.

1466
01:48:06,127 --> 01:48:09,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourney Mix 3 is going to be started, so we're going to see a lot more sim files.

1467
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:10,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray.

1468
01:48:10,991 --> 01:48:21,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, this time around, I'm expecting Vimani really not to enter, you know, unless, of course, you know, almost all of his files are out there except for one, and that's the return.

1469
01:48:22,281 --> 01:48:25,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, well, if he is going to enter, it would probably be that one.

1470
01:48:26,204 --> 01:48:27,065
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1471
01:48:43,994 --> 01:48:45,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki gets on the soapbox.

1472
01:48:46,076 --> 01:48:47,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay, off my soapbox here.

1473
01:48:47,797 --> 01:48:49,999
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Tournament Mix 3, they're talking about actually having prizes.

1474
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:56,164
[SPEAKER_11]: There was going to be some DVDs provided by myself, but they never took me up on that, and now it's too late.

1475
01:48:56,304 --> 01:48:58,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, oh well, screw that.

1476
01:48:58,706 --> 01:49:00,187
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have to buy their own prizes.

1477
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:02,709
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's probably going to be prizes this time around.

1478
01:49:03,109 --> 01:49:07,472
[SPEAKER_11]: There might be a section where you actually have to pay to enter, so that's kind of crap, but whatever.

1479
01:49:07,572 --> 01:49:08,113
[SPEAKER_11]: This time...

1480
01:49:08,493 --> 01:49:14,275
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, unlike the last two times that I said I was going to enter, this time I will enter because I'm actually making sim files now.

1481
01:49:14,795 --> 01:49:19,517
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll see something from me in there if it's not something that I've already made.

1482
01:49:19,757 --> 01:49:22,718
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see something from me in the tournament this time.

1483
01:49:23,619 --> 01:49:25,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I can plug my site a little bit.

1484
01:49:25,419 --> 01:49:28,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, everyone knows about www.leachfromloki.tk.

1485
01:49:29,981 --> 01:49:35,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be uploading, probably tonight, my finished copy of Outer Limits.

1486
01:49:35,425 --> 01:49:37,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I finished that, no, actually, yesterday.

1487
01:49:38,087 --> 01:49:38,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1488
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,449
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you have any time to finish that yesterday?

1489
01:49:42,029 --> 01:49:44,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, technically yesterday, if you consider, like, 1 a.m.

1490
01:49:45,191 --> 01:49:45,612
[SPEAKER_11]: yesterday.

1491
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, I finished that yesterday, so it's almost, it's, no, all ready to go.

1492
01:49:51,395 --> 01:49:52,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need to upload it.

1493
01:49:52,616 --> 01:49:54,538
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of fun, pretty difficult.

1494
01:49:54,658 --> 01:49:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried playing it on the pad today, and I just realized I can't do 10-footers on a pad, so.

1495
01:50:01,221 --> 01:50:03,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs.

1496
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:11,305
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got their user sim file section updated to where people can submit files now and you'll see a bunch of cool stuff come on there.

1497
01:50:12,265 --> 01:50:17,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, DDR UK, if you're not a member of that site, I recommend becoming one because...

1498
01:50:18,607 --> 01:50:24,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Lawrence there, who also you might know him from his Bantu originals and that kind of thing.

1499
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:29,132
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually is doing synced sets for DDR.

1500
01:50:29,272 --> 01:50:36,236
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got synced sets for Euromix and Euromix 2 full sets with MP3s and everything that you can download in one huge zip or by themselves.

1501
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:40,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And also he has Disney's Rave done and he's working on Club Mix and he's going to do the rest.

1502
01:50:40,698 --> 01:50:47,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually if you find his site, which I can't remember the URL by itself, he's got sync sets for Max 2 and DDR Max.

1503
01:50:47,525 --> 01:50:57,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think he had at one point all the other original, you know, 1 through, you know, 5th, but, you know, I have them, but they're not on the site anymore.

1504
01:50:57,555 --> 01:50:58,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'll have to find them somewhere else.

1505
01:50:58,716 --> 01:51:00,838
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're out there, so just, you know, keep looking.

1506
01:51:01,981 --> 01:51:05,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, I don't think there's any more updates with Stepmania.

1507
01:51:05,365 --> 01:51:06,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard anything.

1508
01:51:06,286 --> 01:51:08,829
[SPEAKER_11]: The final just got released.

1509
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Some tumbleweed rolled by.

1510
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:10,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1511
01:51:11,672 --> 01:51:16,777
[SPEAKER_11]: The final got released a couple weeks ago, so not too much going on there.

1512
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:20,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, that's pretty much it.

1513
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:23,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a few people still trying to find out a way to crack the max...

1514
01:51:24,905 --> 01:51:28,690
[SPEAKER_11]: The DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing there.

1515
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:33,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Something I've been working on for months and kind of given up on because I don't play the arcade machines anymore.

1516
01:51:33,876 --> 01:51:38,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe we'll crack that and then I'll go play again and make some more edits.

1517
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:42,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm supposed to make some edits to be on SoCalKicks' site, so look for those.

1518
01:51:43,527 --> 01:51:43,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Wee!

1519
01:52:03,847 --> 01:52:07,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Love is the Power, which is the ending theme from DDR Second Mix.

1520
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:10,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to be in there, another Naoki track.

1521
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:24,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, as I mentioned earlier in my FUs of the Week, Super Eurobeat, which is going to be done by Naoki featuring the DDR All-Stars, which is Paul Terry, B4U, and some other chick, I can't remember the name.

1522
01:52:25,975 --> 01:52:28,316
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, you'll have to listen for that one.

1523
01:52:28,336 --> 01:52:30,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it's going to sound like a train wreck.

1524
01:52:31,858 --> 01:52:34,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, a few more Oni courses.

1525
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:46,605
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a really particular evil one that's got a bunch of slow songs like Bag and Orion 78 played at half speed, so it's going to look like one giant mass of arrows coming up the screen that you can't read, so that'll be fun, I guess.

1526
01:52:47,726 --> 01:52:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Check Aaron in Japan's site.

1527
01:52:49,286 --> 01:52:56,210
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a really cool comprehensive list on there, and his stuff's pretty updated really frequently, so go check that out.

1528
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:57,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's pretty much it.

1529
01:52:59,804 --> 01:53:05,608
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, we've got a few more minutes left in the show, and I thought what I'd do is open up the mailbag.

1530
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:10,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to open up the email mailbag right now on the station.

1531
01:53:10,792 --> 01:53:13,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get some mailbagging music, shall we?

1532
01:53:14,114 --> 01:53:14,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do.

1533
01:53:14,634 --> 01:53:19,177
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm... I'll tell you, let me go ahead and make a mention of something while you're... Yes, please do.

1534
01:53:19,377 --> 01:53:22,139
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm working on a little something now that I have some spare time.

1535
01:53:22,179 --> 01:53:23,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this tournament's over, thank God.

1536
01:53:24,401 --> 01:53:24,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

1537
01:53:25,569 --> 01:53:33,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, go ahead and send in an email to orangechallengeradio.com with what your favorite joke of the show is.

1538
01:53:33,311 --> 01:53:47,655
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be whether it's Malky's Diary, maybe, or maybe our hatred of Paul Terry, or your favorite segment, or maybe even our listless segment.

1539
01:53:47,695 --> 01:53:48,555
[SPEAKER_20]: What is your favorite...

1540
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:52,158
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, staple discussion of our show.

1541
01:53:52,538 --> 01:53:57,582
[SPEAKER_20]: And go ahead and send that and just put attention DS for the subject.

1542
01:53:58,223 --> 01:54:01,406
[SPEAKER_20]: And you may see something come of that within the next few weeks.

1543
01:54:01,566 --> 01:54:02,267
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, cool.

1544
01:54:02,367 --> 01:54:07,611
[SPEAKER_08]: That email address is orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.

1545
01:54:07,912 --> 01:54:09,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to go check the mailbag right now.

1546
01:54:12,176 --> 01:54:13,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to the mailbag, going to the mailbag.

1547
01:54:17,749 --> 01:54:19,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.

1548
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, I see this entire week we've gotten one new email.

1549
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:27,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's one more than we got last week.

1550
01:54:27,751 --> 01:54:29,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, and a lengthy one it is, too.

1551
01:54:29,552 --> 01:54:30,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is a great email.

1552
01:54:32,052 --> 01:54:41,094
[SPEAKER_08]: This comes to us from somebody who refers to themselves as Mask Kun of Suspenseful on behalf of the entire Closet Poppers Society.

1553
01:54:41,734 --> 01:54:45,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when I first read this, I thought, Closet Poppers, that sounds kind of like a rave thing.

1554
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:48,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Read the letter.

1555
01:54:48,573 --> 01:54:49,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's read the letter.

1556
01:54:49,873 --> 01:54:50,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.

1557
01:54:50,674 --> 01:54:51,374
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you.

1558
01:54:51,394 --> 01:54:52,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is three of us now.

1559
01:54:52,235 --> 01:54:52,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1560
01:55:11,016 --> 01:55:16,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is located between the paint cans at his hardware store, which he is not at one of our meetings.

1561
01:55:17,225 --> 01:55:19,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Your 24-hour Bomani words of wisdom inspire us all.

1562
01:55:20,009 --> 01:55:21,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I love people that can kiss some ass.

1563
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:22,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1564
01:55:23,534 --> 01:55:23,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

1565
01:55:25,556 --> 01:55:27,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And we try our best to play every game that they make.

1566
01:55:28,317 --> 01:55:36,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we feel that there may be major bias within those divine offices, and it is starting to get on the Coalition's nerves just a tiny bit.

1567
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,040
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we talking about?

1568
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:46,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, we've chalked up numerous hours of listen time, many thanks to Danny of Surf Punk and Yamye of Asian Ska, who took the time to set up the player.

1569
01:55:46,663 --> 01:55:53,146
[SPEAKER_08]: and on most occasions felt that each of the great Konami's honorable franchises has been fairly represented in regards to each other.

1570
01:55:53,566 --> 01:56:00,689
[SPEAKER_08]: If the collection of 2DX music began to eclipse that of Guitar Freaks or Keyboard Mania, the system would quickly be brought back into relative balance.

1571
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:06,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think we have more 2DX music than any of those, but... I'm pretty sure we do, but I don't know if...

1572
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:08,391
[SPEAKER_20]: But we do have a good selection of the others.

1573
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:09,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.

1574
01:56:09,592 --> 01:56:09,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1575
01:56:09,932 --> 01:56:12,393
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a good selection of most Bomani music.

1576
01:56:12,493 --> 01:56:25,877
[SPEAKER_08]: However, our society is mainly composed of poppin' music 1 through 8 fans, and out of the many times we have tuned in, we have only heard maybe two or three songs out of the well over 350 that exist, and we feel that you're not doing the license any justice.

1577
01:56:26,297 --> 01:56:28,238
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could find poppin' music songs...

1578
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:31,714
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think I know a place where I can find some.

1579
01:56:31,774 --> 01:56:36,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I will make it my mission to download plenty of pop music stuff for you guys.

1580
01:56:36,259 --> 01:56:36,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1581
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:44,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean-Marc of Arty Pop has been especially traumatized by the imbalance and keeps running into walls, rambling about buttons that never were.

1582
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:49,395
[SPEAKER_08]: To make a long story short, we've come to beg you to add more poppin' music tracks to the lineup.

1583
01:56:49,855 --> 01:56:55,823
[SPEAKER_08]: All we ask is maybe two to three a month until the series catches up to its brethren and its long-lived potential.

1584
01:56:55,863 --> 01:56:59,268
[SPEAKER_08]: We repeat, give the poppers the representation they deserve.

1585
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:01,550
[SPEAKER_20]: You asked for it, you got it.

1586
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:02,811
[SPEAKER_08]: You asked for it, you got it.

1587
01:57:02,851 --> 01:57:03,891
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got the space for it.

1588
01:57:03,951 --> 01:57:08,812
[SPEAKER_08]: This week on Orange Lounge, Politary is out, Poppin' Music is in.

1589
01:57:09,232 --> 01:57:13,053
[SPEAKER_20]: But my personal request, we need Poppin' Music and a Melo stuff.

1590
01:57:13,673 --> 01:57:16,914
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to have the Cutie Honey theme on Orange Lounge Radio.

1591
01:57:16,934 --> 01:57:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We will make it our mission to go find ourselves some Poppin' Music.

1592
01:57:20,835 --> 01:57:27,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, here on Orange Lounge, we always go out and buy the legit soundtracks before we put songs into rotation.

1593
01:57:27,357 --> 01:57:27,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

1594
01:57:28,437 --> 01:57:34,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go right now and order soundtracks.

1595
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:35,820
[SPEAKER_18]: We will order them.

1596
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:44,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as those ordered soundtracks are in our possession, we will rip them and play them for you.

1597
01:57:44,524 --> 01:57:48,165
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I will have mine rushed overnight so that they get here.

1598
01:57:48,385 --> 01:57:50,426
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have them rushed overnight.

1599
01:57:50,506 --> 01:57:51,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we shall do that.

1600
01:57:52,167 --> 01:57:53,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a fabulous idea.

1601
01:57:54,287 --> 01:57:57,869
[SPEAKER_20]: We will make sure that they are sent by a special electronic courier.

1602
01:57:58,709 --> 01:57:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1603
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:01,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, electronic courier.

1604
01:58:01,631 --> 01:58:02,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

1605
01:58:03,613 --> 01:58:03,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1606
01:58:03,933 --> 01:58:08,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'll repeat my comment.

1607
01:58:08,597 --> 01:58:09,197
[SPEAKER_18]: End the show.

1608
01:58:09,257 --> 01:58:10,398
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to go to the bathroom.

1609
01:58:10,598 --> 01:58:15,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're going to end the show, but I need to cue up the music real fast.

1610
01:58:15,142 --> 01:58:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So is this tonight's fortune for you right there?

1611
01:58:17,263 --> 01:58:17,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

1612
01:58:18,124 --> 01:58:23,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I need to ask really fast, though, if you guys have any final thoughts.

1613
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:24,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, do you have any final thoughts?

1614
01:58:25,612 --> 01:58:27,193
[SPEAKER_20]: Those taquitos were good, I have to go to the bathroom.

1615
01:58:27,594 --> 01:58:29,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, enjoy the bathroom.

1616
01:58:30,256 --> 01:58:31,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any final thoughts from you?

1617
01:58:31,957 --> 01:58:46,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just looked up one of the older games I used to play, which was One Must Fall, and they're making a sequel to it, so just go check out onemustfall.com, or omf.com, and check out One Must Fall Battlegrounds, which is pretty sweet.

1618
01:58:47,069 --> 01:58:48,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the old school epic game?

1619
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:56,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the old school epic game they're turning into a 16 player deathmatch giant robot fighting game that's going to be fucking awesome.

1620
01:58:57,076 --> 01:58:57,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy crap.

1621
01:58:58,837 --> 01:58:59,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So go check it out.

1622
01:58:59,858 --> 01:59:01,659
[SPEAKER_08]: OMF.com Alright.

1623
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:06,102
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I don't really have one.

1624
01:59:06,142 --> 01:59:07,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a date still.

1625
01:59:07,403 --> 01:59:08,464
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my final thought.

1626
01:59:09,544 --> 01:59:10,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's it.

1627
01:59:10,265 --> 01:59:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: We at the end of the show?

1628
01:59:11,226 --> 01:59:11,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're back.

1629
01:59:12,799 --> 01:59:14,260
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to hear the fortune cookie

1630
01:59:35,783 --> 01:59:38,744

1635
02:00:03,351 --> 02:00:05,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And make it double-double!

1636
02:00:06,293 --> 02:00:08,996

[SPEAKER_02]: To ignite all peoples within our nation!

1639
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This is insulting!

1640
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:17,763

1642
