00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

Hide or launch radio for the fucking children!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Disco.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Missed it by that much.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How can you tell?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I never forget a pussy.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cat.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thirty-seven. My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In a row?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are the weakest link in the fight.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So you get nothing.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You lose.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good day, sir.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I would like, if I may, to take you on a straight journey.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Dark Sakura.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sky.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do I look like the weather girl?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everything alright?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, two corpses, everything's fine.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,800
We are live, and this is episode number 19 for November the Tenored, is the way I wrote

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,800
it on the script here, whoops, November Tenored, November 10th of 2002.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh, it's been a long ass weekend, that's all I have to say.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,080
You're tuned into the Bahmani Scene's most shafted radio station of all things Bahmani.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers,

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840
you know who better is Darksek Rock?

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm more on the funny farm.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No comment.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
They're coming to take me away, they're coming to take me away.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
Say hello also to our newest co-host, although he has been here since the beginning, he's

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,280
still the noob, say hello to Loki.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Everybody.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
And that's it, it's just the three of us tonight.

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Dave couldn't get a ride here, he was begging me for one about an hour before the show started,

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
but...

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,760
at home with my copy of freaking signed that bastard. Oh, do you have some hate mail for

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,400
Dave? Well, let's wait until the F.U. is the week. Okay. We'll be talking to everybody

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,400
else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a really quick break. I know.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,080
If you can't tell, my throat's slightly going today. And no, it's not from anything dirty.

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080
you sick bastards

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,960
anyway uh... we got a lot of big announcements we got

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
local news

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,080
about the big tournament we had yesterday but that includes like

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,680
everything we've got some

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,360
show news including big changes coming next week coming to our website i think

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,120
tonight as we speak at this very moment

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,480
yeah we won't play the song changes you have nothing to worry about

65
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,560
although and then uh... and i'd ask you to myself

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,520
is also coming up later but it's something very very bad yesterday uh...

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,760
very very bad and not

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,480
i was a naughty boy

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
not by you honey

70
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,480
uh... claiming

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,800
alone never mind and gave up the vote

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,480
he just got the blame cuz he left

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
and he was easily anyway

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,360
It was all DDR Mike, he blamed you, he pointed the finger at you.

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,880
Which sign, was it the...

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,840
The movie, Signs.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,520
Signs, Noel Gibson, M. Night Challenge.

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,800
Because Loki gets the hookup and gets the promo stuff, so he has a promo of Signs.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,380
Anyway, let's take a quick break, we're going to play the full

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,700
remix version of one of the new Max USA License tunes.

81
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,700
This is a speed remix of Venus with You Leave Me Alone here on Orange Lounge Radio.

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,660
Oh I can't, oh I can't, oh I can't!

Don't tell me why

119
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:31,080
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

120
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:38,080
You know what? I had Mel cracking up in the car today because I pointed out something

121
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,280
to him that I noticed from day one. The one and only Mel B, right? Or are we talking Melody?

122
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,780
Mel B. Alright. The QQQ sounds like ducks.

123
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,780
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. Seriously, you're one of the bracelets. Well,

124
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,700
Well, we played it during the pre-show, but uh QQQ

125
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,900
You want me to pull up QQQ yeah folks, okay, let's listen now

126
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,780
We're gonna pull this up and I want to take a you know a survey from the chat room here

127
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,700
Tell me that this if this does or does not sound like ducks down to the laughter in the background

128
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:29,020
it sounds like the music they play in the electric parade at dinky land.

129
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
it's like a spiced up version of the chicken dance.

130
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,980
No, I think it sounds like ducks, but it doesn't feel like chicken.

131
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,940
Chat room, what do you think?

132
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
It's not like ducks, am I right?

133
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
Say yes.

134
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
They said work, work, work.

135
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,940
They must be a little bit behind you.

136
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Yay, there is the clown.

137
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Demon child laughter.

138
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Sounds like ducks.

139
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Or they're comparing it to the dying giraffe noise.

140
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,940
bleh, bleh, bleh

141
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,440
at a holic and then you get stoic. Yeah, that's your expression after listening to it. You're

142
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:45,520
like just flat and stoic. Oh, lots of big news. My God. I know. Today is just one big

143
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,640
sigh isn't it? I slept thirteen and a half hours. Did you really? Yes I did. I came home

144
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,640
and took Vicodin. Well, let's fill everyone in that may have missed it. You know, we are

145
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,180
Our international show, Orange Lounge Radio, for the International Bahmani community.

146
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,580
But here in Sacramento, where we're based, as you probably may or may not know, in Northern

147
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,940
California, we're based out of Sacramento, we had a huge tournament yesterday, Shaft.

148
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,380
So we were all a big part of this, and we're all tired as fuck.

149
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,400
And if any of you guys might have been tuned in for our live broadcast, Orange Lounge did

150
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,900
broadcast the whole day live from Shaft.

151
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:30,300
We cut it off around improv freestyle because it was starting to, yeah, there's only so

152
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,180
much you can talk about at a tournament.

153
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,720
I have to apologize for all those who did listen to the live broadcast, I hope you never

154
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,660
have to be subjected to something that horrible ever again.

155
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,300
I'll tell you what, you know what, it was interesting, it was experimental radio, there

156
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,460
were some great highlights.

157
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I haven't listened to the archive yet, I do have an archive of it, I will be putting together

158
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,500
some kind of best of as soon as I can get a hold of that archive file.

159
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Be gentle.

160
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm going to get some clips of Loki going insane, but there were some great moments.

161
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,680
All I know is that I was standing on the Max 2 machine, and I looked over in the corner,

162
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,660
and they'd taken the microphone, some of the folks that were helping us out, and drug it

163
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
out the window.

164
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
That was Evan.

165
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Yeah, it was Evan that did that.

166
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
It was Evan that did that.

167
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm definitely going to talk about Evan a little bit here, too, because he did a great

168
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
job.

169
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,060
And the microphone was out the window, and Jahi was holding onto it, and I know this

170
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,380
This is going to translate well to radio, but he was standing there and he's just going

171
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,080
like this, looking like he's ranting about something and I'm like, there's quality radio

172
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,280
going on in the corner right now, and I'm like, I so wish I could be there right now.

173
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,640
But yes, a big, big thank you to everybody that helped out with that live broadcast yesterday

174
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,200
because Jamie was so busy with tournament things.

175
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,780
I was so busy with tournament things.

176
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,600
We let the new Blokey kind of take the brunt of a lot of that towards the beginning, towards

177
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
the beginning.

178
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
You did a fabulous job.

179
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,900
I kept going in the back room, and kept just hearing the interviews going one after another,

180
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,900
interviewing practically everybody who did an accuracy attack, and I just remember seeing

181
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:09,520
a microphone in my face a few times going, huh, oh, we're live, I have to go over here

182
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,880
now, bye.

183
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,160
Just especially like a big thank you to everybody that helped out with that, Loki of course,

184
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,120
Brad, Irene, JB, 23M, Jahi, just everybody that helped out.

185
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,400
And a big, big thank you to Evan because he got really creative with it.

186
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,960
Evan was born for Internet Radio.

187
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,080
Can we have some fly boys over here?

188
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,320
Evan is a fucking riot.

189
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I got judged.

190
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
He sat at the judges.

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
He wasn't a judge for freestyle, but he sat at the table for a little while and saw some

192
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
forms.

193
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,880
That's one contributing factor to how you guys ran out during improv freestyle, but

194
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
that's okay.

195
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
That's okay.

196
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,060
judge me and he wrote down on the scene nice flaming blue shirt

197
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,680
just all this funny stuff

198
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,360
evan cracks me up and i wish

199
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,680
i wish you could have been there the whole day

200
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,360
just take

201
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,480
to the kind of ease the tension but he's i'm gonna have to get him on the show

202
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,840
he he's not

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
he plays

204
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,400
but money i think she's kind of a closet but money families not he's maybe played

205
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,880
once or twice but he wouldn't

206
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,680
be able to talk about it like we do but he's still funny

207
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,500
so i have to get him on here sometime i think he might be listening so hello

208
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,840
evan if you're listening

209
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:21,540
He had to kind of play relief because I was very sick yesterday at the same time doing

210
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,040
the radio show as anyone that listened realized, and I was losing my voice.

211
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,400
In fact, I had pretty much lost my voice by the end of the day.

212
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,040
And so, I was talking on the radio, trying to think of, it was pretty much me being sick

213
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,220
and all like, just miserable, just ranting on about whatever came to mind.

214
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,320
And it probably wasn't incoherent at parts, but uh...

215
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,400
Much like early episodes of this very show.

216
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,620
And it might as well just call it like, you know, deep thoughts from Loki yesterday.

217
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,660
It's just... it was awful.

218
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,900
It was so awful.

219
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Go donut.

220
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,900
That's all I have to say.

221
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,740
Go donut.

222
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,160
Have you ever seen a beautiful, beautiful sunset, and a flamingo is flying across the

223
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
sunset.

224
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Also, it's holding a rose in its beak and a painting in its paws...er, claws, I guess.

225
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Also, you're drunk.

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Another Deep Thought, by Jack Handy.

227
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,660
That was beautiful.

228
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,160
I have had a cry, thank you.

229
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I actually do actually have the Deep Thoughts book.

230
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I had three of them somewhere and I lost them all because I suck.

231
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I remember one day, we would go visit my Uncle Cave Band.

232
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,160
We called him Uncle Caveman because he lived in a cave, and one day he would eat one of us.

233
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Later on we found out he was a bear.

234
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth.

235
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I think my favorite deep thought of all time was,

236
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
It's true that every time you hear a bell ring, an angel gets its wings.

237
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,160
But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set

238
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:10,120
on fire.

239
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
So anyway, yes, Shaft!

240
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,920
The big topic, it's weighing heavily on our minds.

241
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
No wait, you're sitting on my face.

242
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
No, I'm...

243
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,000
No, the funny thing to tell a child is that when it rains, God is crying, probably because

244
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,400
of something you did.

245
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:33,280
Then there was one about how Disneyland burned down.

246
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,720
I like to play jokes on my little cousins.

247
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:45,680
One day our parents drove us to an abandoned warehouse that told us Disneyland burned down

248
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,240
and then drove us home.

249
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,240
It was like, I'd like to play jokes on little children.

250
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,800
So I took my little, yeah.

251
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,840
But it was getting pretty late.

252
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,880
Yeah, we pieced it together in there somewhere.

253
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
Yes, Shaft.

254
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,000
Deep fried Twinkies.

255
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,840
That's your mouth.

256
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Deep fried Twinkies.

257
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,680
Oh my God.

258
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,280
What DER tournament ever has deep fried Twinkies?

259
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
Had a big sale nonetheless.

260
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
We had the whole RTF versus Step Squad Twinkie eat out.

261
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
I don't know that.

262
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,560
Whoa, whoa.

263
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Did you just say the RTF Step Squad Twinkie eat out?

264
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I didn't mean it that way. My apologies.

265
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't know, apparently there was some sort of little mini...

266
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I think it was just teasing back at... Shut up!

267
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Last week on Org's Loud Show.

268
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
If you use that, I'm going to kick you.

269
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,640
No, but we were... basically it was just like...

270
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
everyone was talking about the heart attack they were going to get,

271
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,640
and then I hear something coming from a Kiyoki saying,

272
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,800
I just took one for Step Squad.

273
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Took one what?

274
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Twinkie?

275
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
It was funny.

276
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,040
And there was actually a guy there named Mr. Twinkie, which was pretty cool.

277
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Sir Twinkie, I'm sorry.

278
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Sir Twinkie.

279
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I met Sir Twinkie's mom.

280
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
She was nice.

281
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Oh, very cool.

282
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,560
There were some people that came in from out of town.

283
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,480
I know there was a caravan that came in from Reno, a bunch from the bank.

284
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,080
Biggest thanks to Fury for flying out from Omaha.

285
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,200
Oh my lord.

286
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,440
Omaha in the house.

287
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
And some SoCal.

288
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,040
leaders and your main expos from so-called

289
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
and my apologies for keep

290
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,540
for constantly stay on the radio that is from kansas because i was sick and out

291
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,520
of it

292
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,940
i heard all the hospital

293
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,340
kansas

294
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,140
kansas nebraska

295
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,840
california word and thank you

296
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,400
uh...

297
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,480
and california originally

298
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,180
uh... and

299
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,740
uh... what else about chapters there's so much talk about

300
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,440
let's talk about the winning freestyle return all the freestyle really

301
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Which I saw three pieces of.

302
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,120
We'll get into that, but definitely I'd have to say my two favorites, you know, obviously

303
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,000
first and second place, Trent Howard, you know, his routine was awesome.

304
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,600
I only got to see that from this, and I was playing Max Two Guard during that time, so

305
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I only got to see it from distance.

306
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,520
There were too many people blocking the way, so I only, like, saw the top half of it, like

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,680
it said, bobbing up and down.

308
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,720
It was very, very, very good, and I did see it.

309
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
It was so smooth.

310
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
It was really nice.

311
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
It was very good.

312
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:43,720
awesome freestyler. Even his improv was right on. It was great. It looked like a routine.

313
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,580
It was crazy. Then first place obviously went to Bruce Leroy and all I have to say is, man,

314
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,120
that guy's got some funk in him.

315
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,060
I have one thing to say about Wendell. Mm-mm, good.

316
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,340
Yeah, I was actually just about to say, and our chat room is going crazy about it right

317
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,060
now because wendell and i i can't remember the name of his partner do

318
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,540
you remember who was like

319
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,280
i feel like an ass

320
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,300
okay thank you all yes holland i wasn't

321
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,940
uh... they did this a hilarious routine that to uh... a d r song that

322
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,940
usually annoys a lot of people

323
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,300
uh...

324
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,440
basically what they did it is the chat rooms going

325
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,840
roast beef, roast beef, hot, hot, hot.

326
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,840
And basically, they did this routine to this song

327
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,760
where basically Wendell was fighting for a sandwich,

328
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,640
kind of thing.

329
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,240
The other guy had a sandwich, Holland had a sandwich,

330
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,440
and just the way they were choreographed to the words

331
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,960
was great, that was hilarious, I loved that.

332
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,880
That was one of the better routines I saw all day,

333
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,340
I thought, although really, every routine,

334
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,280
I mean, I didn't, now, take it, keep in mind,

335
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,040
I didn't get to stick around for improv freestyle,

336
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,640
But every routine I saw that day was great. It really was.

337
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,360
Now to point out some of the more hilarious routines, or I don't even know if we can call

338
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,960
them routines, there was one that's, I don't even know who was doing it because there ended

339
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,440
up being like six or seven people on the stage when it happened, is for Twilight Zone where

340
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,720
they're doing the Mortal Kombat rendition there, that was hilarious.

341
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,400
The Goro made that. The Goro thing where they're stomping on the ground, that was the shit.

342
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Also, notably, probably the most eyebrow-raising routine of the evening was about ten people

343
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,200
all in the routine area doing It's Raining Men, and Irene the Rice Princess is a frequent

344
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,760
contributor to the show, and also I think one of the world's only holders of an Orange

345
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,120
Lounge t-shirt, which we don't even have, as host of the show.

346
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,720
She just was up there singing, and she had her Fly Boys, oh yes, DDR-holic, Anita, was

347
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
up there.

348
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,000
Anita was doing the actual dancing so they wouldn't fail and then Irene was

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,400
just singing and then they had fly boys and and if you'd heard Evan saying

350
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,840
earlier in the evening I need some fly boys we need to get some fly boys and of

351
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,080
course the first two people to speak up Sunia and Ry Ry two two cute younger

352
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,960
girls are all we'll do it you're not a boy that's okay it was great I mean that

353
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
was kind of a very eyebrow-raising routine where a lot of people just like

354
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:27,840
I just remember walking by the Michigan Hill and seeing Bruce LeRoy with his hands in the air doing the swish, like he shot the perfect free throw.

355
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,840
That was Bruce's routine, really, was swish. And that guy has come a long way. I did see a routine.

356
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
He was wearing orange.

357
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,840
The one tournament I ever was a freestyle judge at was an old Sac State tournament.

358
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,840
And this was before Hypnotics and Bruce LeRoy were really well known as freestylers throughout the scene, and they were both there and they did an excellent job.

359
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:58,400
Yes. Very good. I did see a little bit of the improv, and a little bit of what I saw was good.

360
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,720
Improv, by the way, was a last-minute addition to Shaft, because we just wanted to keep it going.

361
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,240
We had a few hiccups with attorney, which we'll come to in my fuck-y's of the week,

362
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,320
week, but everything seems to go pretty good, and by the way, I have to say right now, a

363
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,720
big congratulations to Orange Beanie for making, in his first tournament, fourth place.

364
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Yeah.

365
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,760
And we're probably playing favorites because he's a Sacramento kid, but you know, we got

366
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
to show some sacral love.

367
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Even so.

368
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Yeah, even so.

369
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
To come in fourth place at your first tournament is quite a...

370
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,160
You know, Jessica and I were talking a few weeks ago about how he came up and said, oh

371
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,680
my god, how can you perfect attack so well?

372
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,120
And to have him come up and do that well when only not too long ago he was, you know, looking

373
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,000
up to all of us, that right there, he gets a big pause from me.

374
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
All I gotta say is yesterday some of the most unorthodox things happened at that tournament.

375
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Let's start off with the set up with, you know, obviously we had fourth mix down that

376
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
day.

377
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Which I need to give a little bit of background on.

378
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Okay.

379
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Go ahead.

380
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,760
I don't know how many people know about how a DDR machine works, but you have a CD that

381
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,720
links up to a security card and the security card basically makes you able to play the

382
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
disc.

383
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,200
Well, what it is is they needed a cartridge that will sync the security card to the disc

384
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,720
and their fourth mix came preloaded so they didn't have that cartridge because Melody

385
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,600
was telling me that her solo did the same thing when it had damage done to it.

386
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,880
So we got the card in, but they weren't synced, so the fourth mix stayed down.

387
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Another big thanks to Maple and Iguana Girl for going and modding those pads for us during

388
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,320
the tournament so that we could have them to put on the stage instead of the fourth

389
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,800
mix pads.

390
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,800
We were going to hook up a fourth mix on the PS2, but we didn't have a third mix because

391
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
of the transfer team.

392
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,640
Sorry, I was just going to say a big congratulations to everybody that was involved getting the

393
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,320
fourth mix situation to work.

394
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,120
I think this is probably not the first time PlayStation has been used in a big tournament

395
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,240
like this because I know a while back they were going to do something with the Club of

396
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,920
Pens and OHA or something like that and I don't know if that ever happened or not.

397
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,760
It was supposed to be at the last two-neck tournament.

398
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,720
But certainly the simulator ending up having to use StepMania to do a third mix song just

399
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
because there was just no options left.

400
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
That was downright innovative.

401
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Let's give Matt the applause.

402
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Yes, me and my stupid sim, you know, I just happened to have my computer with me because

403
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I was using it for, well actually it was for the after party.

404
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I had my sim with me and everything and I have all the setup to rig everything together.

405
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,720
So we went ahead and rigged it with my TV out onto the TV and we had the pads going

406
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,940
through my inputs, and it worked great. We had a third mix after the Game of Love working

407
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:12,580
there, and come to find out, it was for Tran Power. He was going to have to pull out otherwise,

408
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,020
and he actually placed second, so he definitely thanked me enough times for that.

409
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,520
We also, Fury, his only routine was on fourth.

410
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,560
I know, and look at this. You've got two guys. You've got one guy who came all the way from

411
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,540
Omaha for the tournament, and then you've got Tran, who hasn't really been very active

412
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,100
in the scene for the past four months or so, you know, he hasn't been very active.

413
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,780
He took a little hiatus, you know, whatever the reason be, personal whatever, but it was

414
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,140
good, it was great to see him back and doing a freestyle again, and it would have been

415
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,100
so awful to have to turn these guys away, but it was really a situation that was just

416
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
out of our hands.

417
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
There's nothing we could do.

418
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
It turned out to work out well for them.

419
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,360
And it worked out awesome.

420
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,260
I'm so happy that all worked out, so big props to the 4th Mix repair people, I guess we'll

421
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
call them that.

422
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Yes, thank you.

423
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:03,660
We took a major hiccup and made it more of a productive burp.

424
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,700
And a big thank you, I believe too, and I apologize if I get this wrong, I believe it

425
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,660
was JM3P that brought the metal pad for Max USA?

426
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
Yes, I think so.

427
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,860
Yes, I think so too.

428
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,380
Big thanks to the folks that helped that get set up.

429
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,600
And a thank you to the DDR Spot staff that was there doing the videos, filling in for

430
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Thanks to Mike Ngo and AJ for taking care of filming all that for us.

431
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Also, one of the biggest thanks goes to, of course, Konami and Jason Enos for donating.

432
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Definitely.

433
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
DVR Max, and a few t-shirts to give out for prizes.

434
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
And hopefully, maybe we'll see Jason in a tournament in the future, maybe.

435
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Hopefully.

436
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
If we can swing it.

437
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Hopefully we'll be able to.

438
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Hopefully we'll get something.

439
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Maybe we'll get Jason on the show someday.

440
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
That would be nice.

441
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,520
try that so we'll see so again we'll get a shaft best of together in the next

442
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,160
couple weeks for this program Loki mentioned the after party that I had here

443
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,240
at the house one thing after a tournament it's probably not the best

444
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,200
idea to have a party honestly because everybody is so dead and so tired just

445
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,800
especially amongst the staff you know if we weren't all local people maybe we'd

446
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,800
have more energy in us but we were just so dead we just all kind of sat here and

447
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,080
watched movies and played video games but I do have one thing I have to say

448
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:28,200
about last night. I love the power glove. It's so bad.

449
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,960
Yeah well just keep your power gloves off for a pat huh? That's all I have to say.

450
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:45,160
Thank you. Yeah I was exhausted after you know we were supposed to be having fun

451
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,880
stuff and I had a major headache you know being sick and everything and I

452
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,680
came back and I set up my metal pads and all that and of course every time I

453
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,160
set my metal pads and they never worked the first time and I ended up having to

454
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,120
dissect these damn things to get them to work so that took forever and finally

455
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,280
got it done everyone started playing I sat there on the couch we watched the

456
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,320
movie and it's just as all fuzzy from there I fell asleep and just slept until

457
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,240
till morning. I was so tired.

458
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,040
We just found out the weasel here, the weasel in the studio. Introduce the weasel to our

459
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:29,040
listeners. His name is Baby Bush Baby. Anyway, so I'm getting the sense in the chat room

460
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,720
and if you want to join our chat room, you're just going to join any other side IRC server

461
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,920
and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge. I'm getting the sense that some of

462
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,160
the people who weren't here in town are kind of left here with question marks

463
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,680
over their head right now so let's let's talk about something a little more

464
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,920
adaptable to folks that are listening to us international what were some things

465
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,240
that we learned from the tournament that other people can take to their

466
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,200
tournaments have the initial d-game there because people love to go to our

467
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,040
vehicle to play it well it happened and people that are available to go play

468
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,760
make sure that you have backups for everything that you do make sure that

469
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
You have plenty of paper for the printers.

470
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,980
Make sure that you have one cash box.

471
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,060
Make sure it's better to have a big staff because things will run a lot smoothly if

472
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,720
you've got everything coordinated.

473
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,160
The staff this year was probably three times as big as last year and it helped immensely.

474
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,760
This made me feel very good to hear that lots of people came up and said that we had a very

475
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,840
efficient staff.

476
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,120
Oh, good.

477
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,280
That's a very good compliment.

478
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,540
Make sure, you know, I thought it was a great idea that we had Elektra Tal as our backup

479
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
NCE.

480
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,460
I am especially glad because after you guys added that other tournament and my voice was

481
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,480
already starting to go, I was like, eh, but Tal took the reins on that and from what I

482
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
understand did a fabulous job.

483
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,000
Unfortunately I had to get to the house before anybody else did to get the party started.

484
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,860
Make sure that if you're going to introduce another portion of the tournament the day

485
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,540
of the tournament that you had back up to just because our judges did look pretty tired.

486
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,700
I'm sorry guys, but thank you for sticking it out like that.

487
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,140
Well, I mean we kind of expected it would be that long anyway, but A-team unfortunately

488
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,980
with the fourth mix problems didn't catch on, so to speak.

489
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,740
So we're going to have to just do it again.

490
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,300
Really I think that everything else went as smoothly as it possibly could, and everything

491
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,540
seemed to flow except for the change over to the fourth mix.

492
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,660
Yeah, that was a big stop.

493
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,460
A little bit, we hear a little bit, we had a little bit too much time in between each

494
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,780
freestyle routine, but do remember that one big thing that we like to do here in Sacramento

495
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,700
with the tournaments is feedback.

496
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,100
And when the judges are not just giving scores, they're giving comments and suggestions on

497
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,500
how to better the freestyle, and that all takes a little bit of time.

498
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,300
So we tried best we could to kind of get people up there and interview them, and we had some

499
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
good stuff.

500
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,380
We had some great in-between stuff.

501
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,900
Brand got up there and did a hilarious imitation of...

502
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,300
I don't know what you'd call him, but it was funny.

503
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:11,340
Bruce Leroy did a great improv little beatbox thing, which was great.

504
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
I did hear that.

505
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
That was awesome.

506
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
That was cool.

507
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,820
I think they did that on Orange Lounge a little later, too, so that was cool, too.

508
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
Great stuff.

509
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,500
I was as frazzled as I was.

510
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,580
I had a good time and I got hugged a lot.

511
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,740
That's the best part of a tournament, isn't it?

512
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,580
Isn't that the best part of a tournament is just random drive-by huggings?

513
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Yes, it was nice.

514
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
It made me feel happy.

515
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,420
But the best comments that I could have heard the whole time that I kept hearing is that

516
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,540
we had a good time and, you know, just hearing we had a good time and when's the next one.

517
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,900
That made me feel really good.

518
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,980
Whole tournament set up actually reminded me of sort of an anime convention because

519
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,360
Because we had like, you know, it was just kind of crazy and you had people doing their

520
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,500
own thing everywhere, like watching movies on their laptops.

521
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,980
We had, you know, I was kind of bored at certain points, you know, before we actually got the

522
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
tournament running.

523
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,400
And so we had people playing DDR Max on metal pad.

524
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,820
We had someone else playing StepMania on a sim.

525
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,980
I had, you know, people were playing the DDR Max 2 on free play and I had my sim sitting

526
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,660
there because we were using my computer for the PA system and I was playing

527
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,940
through there too and and of course because what what term it would be you

528
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,060
know without Tanook Tanook we went ahead and played that too during one of the big

529
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,780
breaks and also played one of those ah shit I can't remember the artist you know we

530
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:43,620
played B4U what was it a coup to what I forget what it's called

531
00:35:43,620 --> 00:36:07,940
What was the biggest advice we could give from Sacramento to the rest of the world from

532
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,540
what we learned this weekend?

533
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
Make your tournament fun.

534
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,540
That's the number one priority you need to have when scheduling a tournament.

535
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Fun, fun, fun.

536
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Keep the drama away from your tournament.

537
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,940
If you've got something going on behind the scenes, you don't need to let the rest of

538
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
the people know it.

539
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,900
As far as they need to see, things are running fine.

540
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,100
And really, it wasn't, I mean, there were, sure there were things falling apart behind

541
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
the scenes.

542
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,820
I wouldn't say falling apart, but you know, just problems, but they were solved and there

543
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,440
was no drama.

544
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
There really wasn't.

545
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,900
At least not that I really saw.

546
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,220
maybe I'm just ignorant but I didn't see any drama which is great so I think

547
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,580
there almost was with some people that were there but we won't make comments on

548
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,660
those people you know and on any of that just that I want to thank people who

549
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,380
kept their patience you know with certain situations poopy on drama yeah

550
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,740
poo-poo all right the feces we are going to take a quick break and when we come

551
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,100
back I'm being told that around eight o'clockish that DSCS SoCal kicks our

552
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,300
buddy down in SoCal who is being our HTML whore basically because I can't

553
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,700
seem to get our old website updated anymore because it's just over my head

554
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,020
so he said okay you suck I'm gonna just do the damn site so I'm like cool so

555
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,260
he's been working very hard on it and I believe he's gonna have it done tonight

556
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,580
and we're gonna look at the site on the very show and we're gonna peruse it and

557
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,760
to give our feedback, our instant feedback.

558
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,960
I'm sure we're all going to love them forever.

559
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,380
So we'll be talking about some show stuff

560
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,280
right after the break.

561
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,520
Things that you'll want to hear if you're

562
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,480
a fan of Orange Lounge.

563
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
And we thank you for listening.

564
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,220
We're going to start this off with a song

565
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,400
we heard a lot of yesterday, and we just

566
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,440
still can't get enough of it.

567
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,720
Not Sugaru, don't worry.

568
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,640
No, not Sugaru.

569
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,000
Not the accuracy attack song.

570
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,520
How about the freestyle song of the day, shall we?

571
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,640
All right, here we go.

572
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

573
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

574
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll take it all out from where

575
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,640
They're all that I need, yeah

576
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I'll take it all out from where

577
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,640
We stand on the edge of the edge

578
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,640
For the woman let's drive

579
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
For the woman

580
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,640
You're the one I'd like to try.

581
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Everybody pull that chick down

582
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,540
Come on, let's jump, here we go

583
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,340
Jump, jump, jump, jump

584
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,740
Everybody just get up, up, up, up

585
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
This is what I get down

586
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,540
Get it on, come on, come on

587
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,740
Jump, jump, jump, jump

588
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,240
Let's go

589
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,740
Everybody pull that chick down

590
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,740
I have powers that people have served as a pro at this point.

591
00:42:34,740 --> 00:43:02,340
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Melby can join

592
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,020
us on all the fun together. Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

593
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,420
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

594
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,220
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

595
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:22,300
best things in life are free. That's right, our buddy Mel B, who was in the studio literally

596
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,060
minutes before we went on Airbnb, but unfortunately they have a long trip ahead of them and couldn't

597
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,820
really stick around. But we thank them for being here this weekend because I know they

598
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:38,300
both were helping out immensely with the tournament this weekend so how'd that go

599
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,500
I think we went to the same Mongolian barbecue place though I believe Friday

600
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,880
and today crashing out last night while I was making a special banner for Wendell

601
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:59,740
in in a tribute to his a roast beefy goodness really roast beef anyway so uh

602
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,740
It was pretty good. Now I'm going to go get my taquitos.

603
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,700
and how he's currently expanding his pornography collection.

604
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Beautiful.

605
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,740
That's always a good idea.

606
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,780
Got to keep a variety.

607
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,900
Hooray for pornography.

608
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,100
Speaking of pornography, they were watching yesterday

609
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,260
at the tournament.

610
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,580
Yes, we're talking about pornography, Jamie.

611
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,900
You miss all the good stuff.

612
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,540
Dave's getting pissed in the chat room

613
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,140
because he brought those taquitos for the party

614
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,980
last night.

615
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:05,980
but we were so dead that nobody thought to cook them. Thank you for my dinner, Dave.

616
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,980
First we don't give him a ride here, and then we eat his food. We are such assholes.

617
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,540
I'm not an asshole, I'm a bitch. Give me a ride.

618
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,780
Oh, God, where the fuck was I?

619
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,180
I don't know anymore. I don't care.

620
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,700
We were talking about...

621
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,580
shaft? No, we were talking about, um... Oh, porn! We were talking about porn!

622
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,700
Dear God, how could I forget? We were talking about pornography.

623
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,380
And the tournament yesterday, um,

624
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,100
at the tournament yesterday, on the little iMac, they were watching the

625
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,020
dirty video by Christina Aguilera, in between

626
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,580
the Titanium Power book, yes, watching Christina Aguilera dirty, and then they were

627
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,820
watching, I believe, the Girls Gone Wild videos.

628
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,420
I missed the... The melody made for, uh,

629
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,420
Did she make the disc for Islander?

630
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,420
She made it, and then Mike no took it.

631
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Aw man, I missed the Girls Gone Wild videos.

632
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,420
Oh gee, I miss all the good shit at tournaments.

633
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:16,420
We do agree though that next time we do an Orange Lounge live broadcast from a tournament,

634
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:23,420
we're going to actually go to the tournament as participants and not staff.

635
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,420
And then we're going to demand that we be allowed a sports center in the back of the room.

636
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,420
We don't have to be in front of the machine, but in the back of the room so we can actually see the machine instead of being...

637
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:41,420
You know, to add to the whole porn thing, I could have brought about a couple hundred tapes of Playboy videos to pass out along the DVDs,

638
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,420
but I thought that wouldn't be family oriented.

639
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,420
No, that's not a family fun center function, unfortunately.

640
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,980
Now, uh, you know, maybe at a different kind of, maybe for the next edit contest?

641
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,120
Oh, that should be your next edit contest, Loki's Edit Contest of Pornography.

642
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Make edit get porn.

643
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,320
Make edit get porn. Beautiful.

644
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,720
That should be like a, that should be an international thing.

645
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,920
I think Orange Lounge needs to sponsor that contest.

646
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,320
Make edit get porn.

647
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,820
All right, you heard it here.

648
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,320
All right.

649
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,720
I will do this.

650
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,220
I will do this that you ask.

651
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:33,220
Alright, the Make-Edit-Get-Porn contest. Details coming soon. To get those details, you'll

652
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:40,940
want to log on to our website, which is currently being reinvented as we speak, and I'm waiting

653
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:56,220
I'm waiting for the word from SoCal Kicks to SoCal Kicks and everything's finished and

654
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,800
we'll go look at the new site.

655
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
And we'll-

656
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,820
Save me some boy porn and I'll do it.

657
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,460
Do you have any boy porn?

658
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,580
Not really, no.

659
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,220
But maybe there's a guy on girl porn that actually shows the guy.

660
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:17,220
I mean, well, we've got, I know for a fact they can get a whole ton of Playboy videos.

661
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,500
For like the last eight months, I have every single video that's been released, and they're

662
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
all crap.

663
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,180
I mean, they're great, but no, it's just, I don't know.

664
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,140
They have their own series that's called Playboy Exposed that's actually like Girls Gone Wild,

665
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,940
except kind of even more ridiculous, but whatever.

666
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,020
Completely off topic from Imani, anything?

667
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,380
I heard they're making a movie out of Girls Gone Wild, but it's going to be like actual

668
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,160
actresses who portray these sorority girls that end up participating in the videos.

669
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:55,660
It sounds like Porky's 3 or something.

670
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,780
It'll be bigger than jackass, I guarantee it.

671
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,640
And this is inside news for everyone.

672
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:08,280
I read today on Weekly World News, okay, that, um, that Nostradamus predicted that Britney

673
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,760
Spears is going to convert to Islam.

674
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,400
Nostradamus predicted it, then it must be true.

675
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,400
Yes.

676
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,600
You might want to have to dispute this rumor going on in the chat room here, Loki.

677
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,360
I don't know what you have to say about this, but you need to set something straight, so

678
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360
to speak.

679
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
I prefer Playgirl.

680
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,360
I've never even seen Playgirl.

681
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,200
What the hell is that?

682
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
SoCal kicks just being a jerk.

683
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,200
No, I've just not turned on about the fact that they don't really do anything.

684
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,200
I mean, all the movies are exactly the same.

685
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,200
They all put them in situations where they start feeling themselves up for no apparent reason.

686
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:47,200
They appear to try to have sex, but for some reason just get nowhere near having sex.

687
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:53,200
I mean, granted, there are some movies that are pretty good, but they're not the ones that are actually like, you know,

688
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,680
Playboy Girls of whatever or something like that, but the actual ones like I had I just got a sex court TV the movie

689
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
And this one's actually pretty sweet, but

690
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,800
We're fine

691
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,840
There's no bimani talk tonight. Just porn

692
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,820
This one's actually pretty pretty cool. You've got um

693
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:25,140
Julia Strains in it, she's pretty famous, and actually Sexcore TV is a really live show

694
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,740
that they have on Playboy TV, where they, it's really stupid, it's like, my girlfriend

695
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:37,620
doesn't let me go down on her, well your punishment is you let him go down on you, in my courtroom

696
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:44,060
on the show right now, and that's what happens, it's kind of stupid, but, oh oh, and I have

697
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:56,060
I have to add, I forget what their booth is or whatever, but it's this giant seashell bed thing that looks like something out of a Little Mermaid porno sequence or something like that.

698
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:07,060
It's the weirdest thing. But that's definitely a good movie. Plus I have a couple of other ones that are really strange. I just had to get it because I saw the poster for it and it was just funny.

699
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,060
Playmate of the Apes.

700
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,060
That one's hilarious.

701
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:27,060
I was just gonna say, I've only ever seen two porn. One of them was the boneheads, like the coneheads with collapsible tops. As in inwardly collapsible, so they could use them. And Final Fuck X.

702
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,060
Final Fuck X is a winner.

703
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,860
Well okay, I have to add that these aren't true pornos, these are softcore porn.

704
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,860
Oh!

705
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Skinemax porn!

706
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,860
Yeah, Skinemax porn.

707
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,460
Okay, now, if you want to get some good porn, you need to definitely go with the Vivid

708
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
DVDs.

709
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,460
Vivid DVDs are awesome.

710
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,620
I mean, the extras on them are worth another movie right there, plus a lot of them are

711
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,620
like a twofer.

712
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,900
You get one movie plus bonus features, plus another movie with bonus features, so a definite

713
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,900
way to go.

714
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,620
You've got like six hours worth of porn per DVD, so go for that.

715
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,940
I realize this says I'm eating a taquito.

716
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:06,180
When next time you're sick of DDR and you need something else to do, go buy yourself

717
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,180
some vivid porn.

718
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:12,260
Well, I know, in the Sacramento area, I mean, in the Sacramento area, I know that you can

719
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:18,020
go to Video Clearance Center, they've got porn as cheap as like two bucks, so go there

720
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,740
and check it out, man.

721
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,220
You are pretty much being worshipped in the chat room right now.

722
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,780
And another bit of money in the news.

723
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:32,180
Loki knows his porno, and remind me when I go to NorCal to go to Loki's, and Loki is

724
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,700
pornified.

725
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,380
And porn on talk on Orange Lounge, I never thought I would see today.

726
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,380
I have a taquito.

727
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,380
It's pornographic.

728
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
You have a taquito?

729
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,340
I don't know.

730
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,300
And then we have a comment, porn and orange chicken, which, you know, yesterday at the

731
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,400
tournament, take this back to Imani a little bit, you brought over some Boston Market,

732
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
and you got a half chicken.

733
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:23,480
It was hilarious because they were trying to pass me a demo of the scorecard sheet thing

734
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,480
My hands were all greasy and sticky from, you know, the chicken, from the goddamn chicken.

735
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Okay? The chicken was damn good.

736
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Get him a norelco for those palms.

737
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,480
Okay. But the chicken was very greasy, so, you know, obviously I was just, you know, going,

738
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,480
uh, don't hand me that because I don't want to touch that, you know, get all these grease marks all over it.

739
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
But good chicken.

740
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,480
The answer that nobody did give, though. We got grape soda, we got porn, nobody said waffles.

741
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,480
Chicken and waffle!

742
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:33,480
I will cut you. Orange Lounge is great. Showgirls is like the greatest movie ever because it is so bad.

743
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,480
But I like watching train wreck cinema.

744
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,480
I like watching your bump and grind on people so that was all worth it for me.

745
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:47,480
And in other Bimani news, I like DDR. I like Beatmania.

746
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,480
Apparently, other people like Beat It mania.

747
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:00,480
You know, DDRaholic says I may not be a guy, but I like porn.

748
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Amen sister, we need more porn freaks in this world.

749
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
Porn is funny.

750
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
My girlfriend likes porn.

751
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
An ideal woman.

752
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,480
She likes porn more than I do.

753
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
Hey.

754
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,480
I like boy porn.

755
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:35,160
Jamie is a yaoi fanatic as she shoves her iron fist of justice into the air.

756
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,100
So just when we're starving to get a new topic, I have SoCal Kicks in this typical IRC way

757
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:46,760
way, telling me 40 times in the chat room, line after line, that he has finished.

758
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:54,040
So let's see what we get if we go to our website right now at orangelounge.skie.cx.

759
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
We're gonna go to it right now.

760
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Here we go.

761
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,040
Loading, loading, loading.

762
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:04,480
It says, oh, we've got the big fat orange, and it says welcome.

763
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,360
I feel like we should be playing the big O theme.

764
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:44,360
this is pretty sick that here we are, the host of the show, we don't know a damn thing

765
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,880
about our own website alright, before we go to the website, we can click right here on

766
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:59,600
the main page, let's see what we get ooh, Orange Lounge, welcome to the newly redesigned

767
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:06,200
Orange Lounge site, thanks to me, SoCalKick, yes, thanks to you

768
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,480
This site will be very easy to run to the point Rob can even update it, hahaha, oh I

769
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,480
appreciate that.

770
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,960
Well now, all pages are very under construction as Sky himself goes in and makes this site

771
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
his own.

772
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,480
Well, you know, Jamie and Cloak, you might want to participate too.

773
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
We're going to have pictures.

774
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Different pictures.

775
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,040
Yes, we'll have new pictures, because we don't want to-

776
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,720
Or it actually looks like my nose.

777
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,160
We don't want to be supermodels anymore, we're just going to take, we're going to jump in

778
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
the garbage can and take a private life.

779
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,440
I will no longer look like Barbra Streisand.

780
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,040
You did not look like Barbra Streisand.

781
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
The nose was.

782
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,040
The nose was.

783
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,040
Oh, no.

784
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,040
I think it looked cute.

785
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,040
The nose was not my nose.

786
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,040
But that's okay.

787
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,040
We'll take new pics just because people want updated pictures of ourselves.

788
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,040
Yes.

789
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
Of ourselves in the singular.

790
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,040
Rob, is there something you're not telling us?

791
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,040
How many of you live in there?

792
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Knock, knock!

793
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Forty.

794
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,040
In a row.

795
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,040
Thirty-seven.

796
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:04,040
Try not to get into more personalities on your way out of the parking lot.

797
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Let's see, let's see, for now be sure to listen to Orange Lounge Radio. Yes, good point. Be sure to listen.

798
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Always, every day.

799
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
Every second.

800
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:18,040
Visit the Live 365 page for more info and a direct link goes to the station site.

801
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,040
And now if you know me well, you know I like whoring out SCK, so here goes nothing.

802
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:29,040
And then he hoars out, continues to whore out the Friday, November 15th launch date of SoCalKicks.com version 5.0.

803
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Yes.

804
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,040
Beautiful.

805
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,040
Let's see if we have anything on these different pages yet.

806
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Oh, no, it just says under construction.

807
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Under construction. Oh, here's what it says for chat. Under construction.

808
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,040
No, wait. For now, I just won't make it pretty and just say what's needed.

809
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,040
The channel is Orange Lounge and can be found on any other IRC.otherside.net server such as IRC.acontrol.org and others.

810
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,040
Very nice. Very pretty. Oh, forums.

811
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,040
Under construction. Of course. Cast.

812
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Oh, come on, Sokal Kix, I know you know who's on cast.

813
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,040
That's alright.

814
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,040
It looks very pretty.

815
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,040
Uh, music.

816
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,040
Normal links.

817
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
Nothing.

818
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,040
Links.

819
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,040
Under construction, but here's your first link.

820
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Hey, Sacre Mani needs to be on there.

821
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
And there's the link to Sokal Kix.

822
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
In the upcoming, we will have...

823
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Might I add, that's one giant link banner.

824
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,040
I'll just have to make, like, one's just as big for Sacre Mani as CDR3 and CDR5.

825
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
That's huge.

826
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,040
That's huge.

827
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,040
It's huge! It's like an orange found on a toothpick!

828
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:40,040
Wow, so the site is very pretty, and we appreciate DSCS and all his hard work.

829
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,040
So a big kisses from all of us to DSCS.

830
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Well, be sure you're involved in any future Twinkie Eating competitions.

831
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,040
Yes, you too can eat out of Twinkie.

832
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:06,360
I have to scream out his slogan. Should we scream it out in agony, ecstasy, pain? How

833
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,720
should we scream out his slogan?

834
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:19,720
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.

835
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,520
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.

836
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,240
That was very ingrishy.

837
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,240
Thank you.

838
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,240
will get to club.

839
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:38,180
So there we go. Oh, in Rave style! I like that idea. Let's say his slogan, in Rave style.

840
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,580
Yes, I like that idea. Let's do that. Let's do it that way. I have to go find my glow

841
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,900
sticks real fast, then I can come back and do this in Rave style.

842
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,140
I don't want to know where your glow sticks are.

843
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:54,140
S.C.K. Accomplishes Ultimate Evolution Just Now!

844
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,780
RS for great justice move orange lounge

845
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,740
And anyway

846
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,540
Let's take it. We're gonna take another quick break. Yes, sir

847
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,700
Rob can like go put his glow sticks away and then we're gonna come back

848
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,180
We're just gonna be a quick break and we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk about

849
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,020
We'll do a little dream do a happy hopper in this break. We're gonna do silhouette of my mind in this break

850
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,020
We're going from extremes here.

851
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,020
Yes, we're going from very happy to very wrist-slitting-ish.

852
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,020
Actually, we're going to go the other way around. We're going to go from wrist-slitting to happy.

853
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:01,020
I look as the blood splashes upon the blackness of my soul.

854
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,020
Woe is me. I dread everything.

855
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,020
I'm so goth that when the night comes, so do I.

856
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,020
SCK accomplishes Ultimate Evolution.

857
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,020
Welcome to goth talk.

858
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,020
And I'm Asriel of the Sea Prince of Sorrow!

859
01:02:44,020 --> 01:03:07,020
A mask inside of me, trapped in a motion Where I want to go with you

860
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:13,020
I need to leave, I need to let go

861
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:21,020
Of all the friends and thoughts inside my mind

862
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:25,020
From all the chains that bind

863
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:31,020
How can I find my way through you?

864
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,520
When it's broken and there's no one left

865
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:40,520
I keep reaching for my hand

866
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:46,520
For all the secrets, secrets of my heart

867
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,020
Reaching to take my hand

868
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:55,520
To trace the silhouette of my mind

869
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,520
Like a child

870
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,520
How can I find my way to you?

871
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,020
I don't care what I don't know

872
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:26,520
You can't see the red of my blood

873
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:07,640
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

874
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,320
Watch all your favorite monster hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki engage in the Bahmani

875
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,320
Battle Royale.

876
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:19,000
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, at 7 p.m. Pacific Time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.

877
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, be suitable for children under 6, pregnant women, retards, and residents of Baltimore.

878
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Are you ready?

879
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Are you ready for the race?

880
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Are you ready?

881
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Are you ready?

882
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we're back.

883
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Two residents of Omaha.

884
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And we're live.

885
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Huh?

886
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Two residents of Omaha.

887
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Residents of Baltimore.

888
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Oh.

889
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
No, I wouldn't do that.

890
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,320
Well, remember that the reason why I said F.U. to Baltimore was because they were the

891
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,940
lowest ranked on the list of what cities are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

892
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,000
I think they had a whopping, like, second.

893
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,300
who

894
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,320

902
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,880
while the musical variety is making me feel like a teen girl and that's really

903
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,780
big

904
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,780
I'm as happy as a little girl.

905
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,780
This is the time of Sprookus when we dance?

906
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,780
This is the part when I want to dance when we dance.

907
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,780
A big welcome to all our new chatters. I see Orange Beanie's in the chat room too.

908
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,780
Hi Beanie!

909
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,780
Hi Beanie, great job at chat yesterday.

910
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,780
And all of our chatters, our chat room's been picking up lately.

911
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,780
Our cutesy girly girl.

912
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:38,780
We got EOSFVB's a new person too, I think they came in last week and Vidpower started chatting here last week.

913
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,780
And all of our regulars, we love them.

914
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:47,780
I think during our next break we need to do our tribute to one of our famous people in our chat room, DJ Konami.

915
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:16,780
You gotta start it off. It's your baby. It's your little crack-infested baby.

916
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,780
Crack-infested baby?

917
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,780
Never do a drug named after part of your own ass!

918
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,780
Wakalaka gives you wings, but...

919
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:36,780
It is that time of the show, ladies and gentlemen, where Jamie and the rest of us all get pissed off as hell, and we give our FUs of the week!

920
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,280
I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

921
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Damn it!

922
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,780
Okay, fuck yous a week.

923
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:49,280
Um, first one is gonna go, and this wasn't anything anyone could control, so I'm saying fuck you to fate

924
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,780
for fucking with us in the fourth mix machine yesterday at Shaft.

925
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:55,780
Damn fate.

926
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,280
F you.

927
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,280
Damn you all to hell!

928
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Okay.

929
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,780
Um, another one goes toward, um...

930
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:06,780
Um, you know, I really need some sleep.

931
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,780
I guess there's just a blur.

932
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,780
Okay, okay. Fuck you to hoarding at the end of the day.

933
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,780
And thank you to Vicodin.

934
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,780
Fuck you to sleeping for thirteen and a half hours.

935
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,780
Sleep feels good though.

936
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,780
Oh fuck yeah, but I will get something to eat.

937
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:26,780
Um, fuck you to, um, you know what?

938
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:30,780
I really am not filled with that in my checks today.

939
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,780
Are you really, Jamie, or are you an imposter?

940
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,780
I feel... good.

941
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:44,780
That fucking sucks! Fuck you to my good mood, dammit, because I can't be eggsy enough to go off and out something enough to just be super pissed.

942
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,780
And I have to be super pissed to be ready to kill people too.

943
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,780
Okay, oh.

944
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,780
No, no, I can't. You don't need to.

945
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,780
Fuck next.

946
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,780
Okay, so much for that.

947
01:09:54,780 --> 01:10:00,780
Sorry to hear that. Well, you know, after 19 weeks of being pissed off, it's time for Jamie to be in a loving sharing mood, right?

948
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,780
Fuck that, okay? That pisses me to hell. Okay.

949
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:09,780
Alright, let's talk to Loki and see what his Fuck You of the Week is.

950
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,780
Fuck You of the Week? Yeah, Fuck Yous of the Week. That's definitely for sure.

951
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:20,780
First one goes to my cold. I don't like having a cold and it snuck up all the way up Friday and that really sucked.

952
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:25,780
It's probably all the rain's fault, so F.U. to the rain, even though I like rain.

953
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,780
F.U. for my battery being dead this morning in my car.

954
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:32,780
At least it works now, I think, so that's cool.

955
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:38,780
F.U. to Sagaru, because I hate that song, and they played it way too many times at the tournament yesterday.

956
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:43,780
Also, a big, huge F.U. to something we're going to be covering in just a little bit.

957
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:48,780
F.U. to Super Eurobeat, the new song that's going to be on GDR Extreme,

958
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,780
One of the most evil things on the face of the Earth.

959
01:10:51,780 --> 01:11:01,780
When you add Naoki with B4U with Politary, who was another person, you know that's going to be pure evil right there.

960
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:05,780
So I'm very scared and concerned about that one.

961
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,780
I show great concern for this new song.

962
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:13,780
Um, also, let's see, what else do we got here?

963
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:20,780
FU to my, uh, pads for being faulty sometimes and me constantly having to repair them.

964
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:31,780
FU for myself for getting shocked by my stereo numerous times while I was putting wires to it because I'm an idiot and I was tired and didn't unplug it when I was hooking up wires and just kept going,

965
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,780
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

966
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:41,780
Little Elder sounded vaguely pornographic.

967
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:17,780
There's something I remember seeing yesterday that I was going to do an FU bout but I can't remember what it was.

968
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,780
Damn it.

969
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,780
Well, fuck that. We'll come back to you, Loki.

970
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Yes!

971
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,780
In the meantime, my FU of the Week.

972
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,780
We'll come back.

973
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,380
My FU of the week goes to myself.

974
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:40,620
Yesterday during the Orange Lounge live broadcast we were doing live from Shaft, we did some

975
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,860
music breaks so that Loki and whoever was on air could actually have a break to get

976
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,280
up and go out and do something.

977
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,020
And one of the CDs that I used during the break was Dance Mania 20.

978
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,980
So unfortunately yesterday I unknowingly played Bye Bye Baby Balloon on this station.

979
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,460
You bitch.

980
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:05,780
So a big fuck you to me for breaking that rule that I put down weeks and weeks ago when

981
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:10,340
Bye Bye Baby Balloon was voted by the listless process as the worst Bomani song next to Let

982
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,340
Them Move.

983
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,340
I played it yesterday.

984
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,700
Not only did I play it, I played the full version.

985
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,540
Wait, so this is gonna play dirty.

986
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,020
I didn't play dirty yesterday, however I have in the past.

987
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,020
I have a fuck you.

988
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,020
I have one.

989
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,020
Yes. I have one.

990
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,020
Okay, we have to go back to your music.

991
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,020
Yes, of course.

992
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,020
My fuck you goes toward that damn song for finally growing on me. Oh my god.

993
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,020
I found myself at work with that song stuck in my head.

994
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,020
What song, by the way?

995
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,020
Fucking dirty.

996
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,020
I'm pointing a finger at you.

997
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,020
Stop swimming at me.

998
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,020
Everybody yell at Rob.

999
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,020
Meanie.

1000
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1001
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,020
Did Loki- Oh, Loki, you thought of your FU?

1002
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,020
Alright.

1003
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,020
Okay, this is a general FU.

1004
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,020
FU do speed mixes.

1005
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,020
They're the dumbest things in the face of the Earth.

1006
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,020
I hate everybody that does speed mixes of any sort.

1007
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,020
This goes with Jenny Rom and the Zippers.

1008
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,020
I hate them all!

1009
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,020
I hate them all!

1010
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,020
JB is rocking here right now.

1011
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,020
I'm just gonna rock a lock on your ass.

1012
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:23,020
I don't care, okay. No, no, they've done some slower stuff, it's cool.

1013
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,020
Amen, just wanted to make a-

1014
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:28,020
But I hate- I hate bean mixes. I hate them to death, okay?

1015
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Now, okay, I'll give credit to, you know, Jenny Rahm and stuff, because some of her stuff is good, I do like it, you know?

1016
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:40,020
But I dislike, for instance, we just heard the Venus, um, was it, uh, you can leave me alone?

1017
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,020
Yeah, we just heard it, like, an hour ago.

1018
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,020
Whatever, okay?

1019
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,420
But so we heard it, it sounds like shit, okay?

1020
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,520
That's just... just like, okay, I've heard one more time, that sounds like shit,

1021
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,620
I've heard, like, I don't know, there's a bunch of stuff that I've heard, all of it sounds like crap!

1022
01:14:55,620 --> 01:15:00,220
You just speed it up and have some guy cover it because you can't pay the artist royalty fees,

1023
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,420
and it sounds like shit.

1024
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,420
And then the comedy goes,

1025
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,020
Ooh! It's fast!

1026
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,820
Let's put it in our next New York Stream super duper mix,

1027
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,920
and then, you know, people play it and go,

1028
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,520
Damn, this is tiring.

1029
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,120
I dislike it. I hate it.

1030
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,120
And living in America sucks ass.

1031
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,120
Remember, CDR isn't just a power, it's a super duper power.

1032
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,120
Ugh, God.

1033
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,120
Ugh!

1034
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,120
Stupid freakin'...

1035
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,120
Wow.

1036
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,120
And F you to Nayoki because...

1037
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,120
I wanna say that.

1038
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,120
Well the chat room...

1039
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,120
And F you to freakin' Nayoki Jirls because he's not putting anything good in there.

1040
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
And why is he speaking Japanese?

1041
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
Why is he Japanese or something?

1042
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,120
He can't speak English like everybody else in the face here.

1043
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,120
Why does this fuck you speak that?

1044
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,120
I was good in America after I sucked that one guy.

1045
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,120
To find out what this fuck is!

1046
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
I'm done!

1047
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,120
I'm finished.

1048
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,120
The chat room is yelling at you, Loki.

1049
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,120
They're half with you and half against you.

1050
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,120
Half of them are with you and half of them are against you.

1051
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,120
Oh dear god.

1052
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Okay.

1053
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,120
Are we ever going to get to the chat rooms?

1054
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,120
Fuck the chat rooms.

1055
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,120
I'm sorry, I love you guys, so forget that.

1056
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,120
First of all, speed mixes are okay.

1057
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Some of them suck ass.

1058
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:41,120
Some of them suck ass. Major fuck yous go to Polteri for still being around.

1059
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:52,120
The woman, I've been listening to Polteri now, unfortunately, for days, because it keeps coming up.

1060
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,120
I say that we have a one week ban on Polteri from our radio show.

1061
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,120
Oh, we're going to ban Polteri for the radio show?

1062
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,120
Just for a week.

1063
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,120
Just for a week?

1064
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,120
There are some songs that have good music in them that are just really nice.

1065
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:10,120
Alright, fair enough. Starting tomorrow, Orange Lounge has banned Politary from its playlist completely.

1066
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:19,120
Um, I have another proposition. I am offering a $500 bounty for Politary. Dead.

1067
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,120
No, no, you can't kill her! This killing is wrong!

1068
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,120
Alright, how about this?

1069
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,120
$500 for her to go mute.

1070
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,120
Shove, like, acid down her throat?

1071
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,120
Shove a Twinkie down her throat.

1072
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,120
A dry Twinkie!

1073
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,120
$500 for a super hot fried Twinkie, shoved down volunteer's throat.

1074
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,120
To dissolve her larynx, and she can't sing anymore.

1075
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:44,120
I want her tongue sent to me in a plastic baggie through the mail.

1076
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:50,120
Make sure that you vacuum seal it so that it stays fresh so we can see it still twitch.

1077
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:55,120
Oh my God! We've had sex, we've had violence.

1078
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,120
We've had sex in the first hour of the show, we have violence right now.

1079
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,960

01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:36,560
Also, I'm going to have to say that, um, oh, shoot, what else was one of my, uh, FUs?

1089
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:44,560
Oh, FU to Scandia for having their party room window covered up by blue paint or something because I couldn't see the friggin' machine.

1090
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,560
But Scandia rules, so we'll forgive him this one time.

1091
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,560
Ah, yes, Orange Lounge Vice City tonight. That's what we're being called.

1092
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:59,560
You know, oh, F you to Vice City, because I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

1093
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,560
She gets in my car, she takes money, and she goes, you know what, that's your sound clip from now on.

1094
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,560
For the life of me, I can't get the hooker to have sex with me.

1095
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,560
This is now chat room fuck you time, so Rob, go at it.

1096
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,560
Oh yes, okay.

1097
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,560
Oh, I had special music for them, that's okay.

1098
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:29,560
I like KOGD3. They kick ass, instead of Red Monster Hyper.

1099
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:59,560
I have to beta-test SDK Max 5.0 in the next 2-3 days, finish my special art project by Wednesday, or get an F on it, and make an Avid site out of my ass before December 7th.

1100
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:07,560
And F you to Loki, tell him to get him on fuckin' AIM because I'm home all effing gay.

1101
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:14,560
Dave, I have to give Dave special music. I don't remember what Dave's FU song was, though. Does anybody remember Dave's FU song?

1102
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,560
I'm just gonna play this song for Dave, he'll like it.

1103
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:51,560
I'm reading without thinking. Sorry. I hope she's not listening with her speakers turned up, but somebody's in trouble.

1104
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,560
My bad, sorry guys.

1105
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Back to the arrested chat room.

1106
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
God, he's got too many. I'm only doing part of these.

1107
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,560
F you for not understanding a single word of the Shaft stuff tonight. F every female on this planet.

1108
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,560

1109
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,560
and celebrate

1110
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,560
hey

1111
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,320
for fucking me up on only

1112
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,020
at the entire cbsd dr coverage which we've got to talk about for the shows

1113
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,020
over

1114
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,200
at those stupid dancers who won the s two and pads on that

1115
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:28,640
and f low-key because he asked for

1116
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,160
twenty-third maggots uh... f roulette he expects something on race style when he

1117
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,920
does improv freestyle or something like sugaru for improv

1118
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,200
that's really

1119
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Instead, as we all know, he got Nori Nori Nori. Kill!

1120
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,200
I still should get an award for most incongruous routine. Fuck you, Nori Nori Nori.

1121
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,200
DJ Konami

1122
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,200
F you to Kakumei Encore Stage because I failed on the sixth step.

1123
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,200
SoCal Kicks, I missed a part and I closed the window. I'm sorry, resend it to me. I'll read it.

1124
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,200
JB says

1125
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,200
F you to anyone who doesn't like Hello Panda cookies. They should be stabbed with sporks.

1126
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,200
F you to hurting after the turning and burning myself in the deep fryer.

1127
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,200
I like how he has a cookie.

1128
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,200
And I say Polteri can sing and Naoki can't compose.

1129
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,200
I'd like to add that JB, you know, kind of that was your fault

1130
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,200
since you're deep frying everything that you could get your hands on.

1131
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,200
I mean, that was pretty entertaining watching him deep fry pretty much everything.

1132
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,200
And I think one of the most popular things that was being deep fried yesterday

1133
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,200
other than Twinkies had to be the candy corn.

1134
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Deep fried candy corn.

1135
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,200
By the way, you're very welcome. I hope you enjoyed your Hello Kitty Yan Yan.

1136
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:09,440
the girls gone wild there should be a guys gone wild series

1137
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,440
g-o-s-s-b-b says wow

1138
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:19,440
fuck you

1139
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,680
a little racist i don't want to read that on the air

1140
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:28,320
so he says china power so we'll leave it at that

1141
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,520
vidpower says my nephew of the week goes to the official animal crossing site

1142
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,520
because they've taken down the Donkey Kong Jr. Nest game and it's now replaced with Clu Clu Land D.

1143
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,520
I think we have the codes for that if you need it.

1144
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,520
Now I can't get Donkey Kong Jr. in my town now.

1145
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Also, F you to wrapping paper because I like to keep my DVD covers in excellent condition

1146
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,520
and the wrapping paper took about 45 minutes to get off because of all the extra tape they put on it.

1147
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,520
I have another fuck you.

1148
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
You've hit your quota for tonight.

1149
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,520
Uh, I'm the angsty happy bunny.

1150
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,520
My fuck you of the week goes to my fiancé Dan for hitting Mallory in the head with the bug net.

1151
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,520
Mallory is a bitch and she needs to die.

1152
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,520
She needs to burn in Animal Crossing hell.

1153
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,520
I do not want Mallory to-

1154
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,520
Go to Animal Crossing hell and burn Mallory. I hate you.

1155
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,520
And also to our town lesbian Dina.

1156
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,520
Because she went ahead and took care of her errand myself just because it was a day late.

1157
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:35,520
And, and, and, and fuck you to, um, well, you know what, I need people to play Phantasy Star with, so if anyone else Phantasy Star Online in a broadband thingy for the GameCube, let me know, or if not, then fuck you.

1158
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,520
I don't wanna play with you.

1159
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,520
SoCalKick says F you to whoever hates on Loki.

1160
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,520
He doesn't get my music.

1161
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,520
I'm sorry, you're right, he doesn't get your music.

1162
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,520
Give him Miracle Moon.

1163
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
He gets something even better.

1164
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,940
1... 2... 3... 4...

1165
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:52,320
F you to whoever hates on Loki because that was the best rant-a-thon I've heard in ages.

1166
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,260
Awwww!

1167
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:59,120
23rd Magus, uh, Pauletari sounds like Yoko Ono with Laryngitis.

1168
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,260
Co-co-co-co-co...

1169
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:04,480
Gwen says F you to me because I wasn't supposed to say that female one on the air.

1170
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,740
My bad!

1171
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,360
EOSFBB says F you to me for being quote unquote racism.

1172
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,120
Sorry, you just kind of used some kind of words. I don't want to stay on the air. It's kind of bad

1173
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,720
And DDR and it's on a happy note. Thanks for the kudos Rob and Jamie

1174
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,320
Yes, whoever took my signed tape

1185
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:16,840
this is dedicated to all DJ Konami fans of the world, here you go, enjoy

1186
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,480
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami

1187
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,480
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics

1188
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,200
Listen carefully and try to follow

1189
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,480
The object will come down from the top

1190
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:38,480
When it hits the red line, push the button.

1191
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,480
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

1192
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,480
You get it?

1193
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:46,480
Alright, let's practice.

1194
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:57,480
First, hit the white keys.

1195
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,480
Now, hit the black key!

1196
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,480
Yeah.

1197
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
Yeah.

1198
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,480
Yeah.

1199
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black key!

1200
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,480
Easy, huh?

1201
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Alright, let's go on to the Scratch game.

1202
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,480
Can the object reach the red line?

1203
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Scratch!

1204
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,480
With the fast note, the technique is to Scratch fast.

1205
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

1206
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,480
It's hard, but you can do it!

1207
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,480
Okay, effector time!

1208
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,480
And here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

1209
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,480
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

1210
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,480
That's the effect on an on switch.

1211
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:31,480
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

1212
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,480
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

1213
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

1214
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:47,480
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

1215
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,480
This powerful sound system's whooping, everybody!

1216
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,480
Ha!

1217
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,480
All right, gotta go!

1218
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Knock me out with your fabulous sounds

1219
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,480
Some very little version of good speed man, yeah

1220
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,480
I got it

1221
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,480
This is house

1222
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,480
This is house

1223
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:42,760
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

1224
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,460
As we demonstrate

1225
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,360
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1226
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,860
Bolsa mila means the eye

1227
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,660
Coso los a la gravity I know the fight

1228
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,660
Cos I spy, damage fly

1229
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,060
This is the way we dance

1230
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,360
This is the way we rock

1231
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,760
This is the way we fight

1232
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,060
As we demonstrate

1233
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,060
As we demonstrate

1234
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,780
This the sounds

1235
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,420
This the sounds

1236
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,020
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1237
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,540
Pull the meat, I miss the eye

1238
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:24,900
Push the moves when I cover the eye

1239
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,500
Throw the fight cause I spy

1240
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,500
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

1241
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,500
This is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate

1242
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,500
As we demonstrate, everybody wants a piece of the pie

1243
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
Who's a reader, mister I

1244
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Who's a loser, like nobody I know the fight

1245
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,500
Cause I smile, this is the way we dance

1246
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,500
It's just the way we rock and it's just the way we ride

1247
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
Tonight

1248
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,500
I'll try to let you remember

1249
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:16,500
All the time, that we were having together

1250
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:23,500
Sing a song, you and me can be singing

1251
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:28,500
Tonight, such a pleasure, come on

1252

Love the night

1257
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,500
Release the seven senses

1258
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,500

Let yourself go

1280
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,500
Oh...

1281
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500

01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Feel the flow now, oh now

1285
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,500

Feel the flow

1287
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500

Flotation

1289
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
Lose control

1290
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:30,940
What?

1291
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,780
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1292
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:37,200
If you don't know Wesley Willis, maybe you should.

1293
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,260
That's where that little promo comes from.

1294
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:46,760
It was a joke, and I don't even think it was really something I ever intended on putting into the station rotation, but we need a new promos. What can I say?

1295
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,260
We'll make more, then.

1296
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,260
We'll make more.

1297
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:56,260
Yeah, sometime this...now that the tournament's over, we can, sometime this week, get you guys over, we'll work on more promos. That'll be fun.

1298
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:03,260
Oh, they're asking about the Bubble Bobble techno song that we played one night. Do you remember what that was, Jamie?

1299
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,260
That was last week. It should be on...it's on this disc.

1300
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:10,260
We don't have to play it right now because we probably don't have enough time because we've got enough stuff that we want to talk about.

1301
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:15,260
Maybe we'll get to it in the after birth, but do you remember what that was called and where you got it?

1302
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,260
It was one of the Overclocked remixes.

1303
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,260
So probably Overclocked.org?

1304
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,260
Yep, should be Overclocked.org, look under B.

1305
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,260
Search for Bubble Bubble and you'll probably find it.

1306
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:28,260
All I've got to say is, you know, I've been, you know, especially nowadays, you know,

1307
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:35,260
I'm totally browsing the internet while I'm working, because I like to exploit their T1 line there.

1308
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:42,260
I've been checking out a lot of these Overclock remixes, and there's this one artist in particular,

1309
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:48,260
I believe his name is DJ Final Fantasy, or DJ Fantasy or something like that.

1310
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:52,260
And he's actually done some stuff for Final Fantasy VII.

1311
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:57,260
He did this one that's called Strings Machine, that's just an awesome trance.

1312
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:01,260
I mean, this guy should be doing professional stuff, I mean, I don't know why he's not.

1313
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:11,260
Yes, the ones to check out are definitely Strings Machine, then there's also one that's a Geneva Trance remix, that's really cool, there's a few other ones.

1314
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:18,260
Metalroid is another good one to check out, it's a Metroid themed remix, it's kind of hard rock, which is pretty cool.

1315
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:19,260
What's that URL one more time?

1316
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:23,260
It's, I believe it's remix.overclock.org.

1317
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:27,260
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay, that's cool, remix.overclock. Good stuff.

1318
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:30,260
If you just do a web search for overclock, you'll find it.

1319
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:34,460
Well you might want to do Overclock Remix otherwise you're going to get a bunch of sites.

1320
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,460
Don't clack me.

1321
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:39,680
Alright, let's talk about, we've got about 20 minutes left in the show, we've got a bunch

1322
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,860
of Imani news to cram in, but speaking of time left in the show, this is an announcement

1323
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:47,900
we haven't made yet during the show, we probably should have opened the show saying it, but

1324
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:55,620
starting next week with episode 20, Orange Lounge season number 2 debuts a whole new

1325
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,620
season.

1326
01:36:56,620 --> 01:37:01,560
I'm concerned the past 21 shows or however many we did because we had a couple have shows in there

1327
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,880
They've all been leading up to next week. Yes, it's all been practice

1328
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,380
Because next week we're taking orange lounge to three hours a three hour tour

1329
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,200
Save a three hour tour

1330
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:22,240
We're gonna start the show at 630 Pacific Standard Time half hour earlier. We're gonna run it a half hour later to 930 and

1331
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,440
Loki

1332
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,880
officially on board as the third co-host since he's been the past couple weeks

1333
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:32,480
and uh... we gotta rework a new intro because we'll have to get Loki in there and

1334
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,600
all sorts of stuff. It's gonna be a whole new season. Now we got a new website to match.

1335
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,160
So we're getting a facelift. We're getting a facelift.

1336
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,720
Maybe we should be here when

1337
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,240
Rob makes the intro or maybe

1338
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,440
someone should hook me up with a particular program that we need to let somebody else make an intro.

1339
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,880
I can hear it now.

1340
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:54,480
Loki! For the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me!

1341
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,080
Thank you for giving that to me once again, nice and clear. That'll make editing a lot easier, thank you.

1342
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:03,980
Um, so that's how it's gonna go. It's gonna go 6.30 to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.

1343
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:10,580
The replays will still be 7 o'clock on Monday and 2 o'clock on Thursday for the time being.

1344
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,380
As long as I get to be an angsty, happy bunny.

1345
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,980
Of course, as always.

1346
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,680
Happy. Or angsty, or both.

1347
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,520
that's uh...

1348
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:22,040
pretty much all you need to know new season starts next week now you know and

1349
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,680
knowing is half the battle

1350
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,680
okay

1351
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:32,160
but money news this week way back to monday day after we did this show cbs

1352
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,840
on the early show i was asleep did

1353
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:38,560
uh... a little ddr promotion on it

1354
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,880
is basically one gigantic infomercial for ddr where everybody did not know

1355
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,160
shit

1356
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:49,760
that would be the best way to describe it. It was like taking the audience members from

1357
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,760
an infomercial and having them do the infomercial. Here's what they did. They got this local

1358
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,480
dance school to come down there, and they had these people that I guess were from some

1359
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,440
dance school from what it looked like, a local school and everything, and they were playing

1360
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:06,680
DDR. The dance school of Jennifer Lopez. Okay, it was pretty bad. I mean, no one really knew

1361
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:12,200
what they were doing, watching like newbie people playing DDR USA. They had three machines

1362
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:16,480
there and then all speaking of the machine setup

1363
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:21,120
this pissed me off I don't know why I get angry about it but I just find it

1364
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,200
kinda irritating

1365
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,520
they had max two machines with USA banners on them

1366
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,600
that's I'd

1367
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,680
that really strikes a bad chord with me it's kinda like

1368
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:39,000
Konami why why you have to lie why don't you just give us a new mix

1369
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,560
Oh, that's interesting.

1370
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,560
Did you not notice that?

1371
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,560
I did not notice that.

1372
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,960
There was freeze arrows they were playing, and one of the songs being played was Japan.

1373
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:48,960
They had Max II...

1374
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,960
Matsuri, Japan.

1375
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,880
Sorry, Matsuri, Japan.

1376
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,480
One of the machines, the one in the middle was a USA machine, the one that the CBS host

1377
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:59,620
played on that was a USA machine, however the two side machines were Max II machines.

1378
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:04,900
And it's kind of like, you kind of feel like, you know, obviously for Joe, Q, Public, those

1379
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:09,860
Those that don't know DDR very well, you know, it doesn't matter, it's not a big deal.

1380
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:15,300
But you're kind of like, why are you misrepresenting the product here?

1381
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,900
I mean, now the home version of Max is similar to Max 2, it's got a lot of the cool things

1382
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:20,900
Max 2 does.

1383
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:24,140
Why didn't we just have somebody demo the home version of Max?

1384
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:29,300
Why did we have to invent these arcade machines that don't exist in the US?

1385
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,860
I don't know.

1386
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:35,520
It doesn't sit well with me, and I think Konami deserves a big slap on the wrist for that.

1387
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,180
Well, one of the highlights I thought that was pretty interesting...

1388
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,340
Or whoever made that decision, maybe Konami didn't make that decision.

1389
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:46,060
You gotta love that they had a video game expert there who was talking about DDR and

1390
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,420
had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.

1391
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:55,260
All I could think of during that whole thing was, that guy's really gay.

1392
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:56,420
He's really, really gay.

1393
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,620
He's saying gay things.

1394
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,940
He's kinda talking gay.

1395
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:02,620
This whole segment is kind of gay.

1396
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:08,380
I don't know, I didn't see this, and I'm sounding vaguely glad that I didn't.

1397
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,820
I was asleep.

1398
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:15,940
I'm being reminded that one reason they probably did the marquee switch was because the imports

1399
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:16,940
are illegal.

1400
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,940
Okay?

1401
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,940
True that.

1402
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:24,020
But that doesn't get around the issue of you used an import machine, you just lied about

1403
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:25,020
it.

1404
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,020
Exactly.

1405
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:29,860
it's like, you know, okay, so they had trouble importing USA machines.

1406
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:34,620
Fine. Why didn't we promo Max USA? It's a damn good product.

1407
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:39,100
That's what we should have been demoing. You know, if they had, you know, maybe

1408
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:42,700
out of PlayStation, a couple ignition pads, could have hoard out Red Octane,

1409
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:46,780
or the official Konami pads if Konami wasn't over off their own product.

1410
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:50,980
Well, what they ended up doing is they had a drawing throughout the show, which anyone watching a show

1411
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,580
really didn't give a rat's ass.

1412
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:54,580
It was only for the people actually at the show.

1413
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,580
Yeah, I know. Super contest, which has been pre-taped.

1414
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:07,580
It was two pretty shitty-ass third-party dance performance pads and a, what was it, PlayStation 2 and a DDR Max USA game.

1415
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,580
Which is pretty, I mean, obviously that's pretty cool, you know, I'd love to win that if I was there.

1416
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,580
The thing is, they didn't really plug the game that much.

1417
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,580
I mean, they talked about, you know...

1418
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,580
No. No, they kind of didn't. They were just kind of like,

1419
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:25,220
Well, it's this new game that's sweeping the nation, and we're going to let these ignoramus

1420
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:29,100
dent students play it, and we're going to give one of them a fabulous prize of a home

1421
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,780
version game that we're going to just kind of show you, the box art of.

1422
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:37,940
What's funny is Konami is kind of trying to forget about DDR USA.

1423
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:38,940
You think?

1424
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:39,940
Yes.

1425
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:43,700
Notice, on the show, they only mention DDR Max and Konami.

1426
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,260
There's no mention of DDR USA.

1427
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,300
Oh, the first PlayStation version?

1428
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,580
No one wants to remember that.

1429
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:52,540
comparison economics USA mix is inferior I mean it's just like you wouldn't talk

1430
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:58,100
about first mix in Japan anymore I mean DDR USA was kind of our first mix I

1431
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:01,980
guess yeah but I mean that's a whole nother debate that we've had too many

1432
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:09,900
times on the show and also it might not have been Konami's fault that whole

1433
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,600
switcheroo might not have been Konami's fault it may have been CBS that made

1434
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,420
that decision but F whoever did that because that wasn't cool

1435
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,940
Whoever's decision it was f them. Yeah, I saw some pictures from it

1436
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:24,360
And honestly if you're going to show off something

1437
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:29,780
It's like having a product if you're gonna show a product you put it in the most positive light possible

1438
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,780
And you don't do it by putting

1439
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:36,140
People who have no idea what they're doing there. It's like basically

1440
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:39,660
Being told how

1441
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:43,340
Being instructed in the cop in the Kama Sutra by a priest

1442
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:48,780
It's the same difference.

1443
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:54,060
They have no idea how to do any of that, unless they've been reading confiscated material.

1444
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,060
I don't know about some of them, but you know.

1445
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,060
No, I agree.

1446
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:00,020
I don't understand why they didn't interview the dance expert.

1447
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:02,460
They had all these DDR people in.

1448
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:06,460
They flew 8-Ball out there, or he flew out there, I don't know what the hell the arrangement

1449
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:11,260
was there, but he was just kind of there in the background, wearing a DDR Freak t-shirt.

1450
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,260
I thought I...

1451
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:13,260
What was that?

1452
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,160
Didn't he make a comment during one of the clips?

1453
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,260
I'm not sure, because I didn't exactly...

1454
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,500
I don't know what 8-Ball looks like, to be honest.

1455
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,160
And I thought there was some guy that looked like he knew he was talking about, and...

1456
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:24,860
He was the only guy wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

1457
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,020
That might have been him, then.

1458
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,020
I don't know.

1459
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,020
I can't remember.

1460
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,020
If I remember correctly.

1461
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,020
It was...

1462
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,020
I don't know, either.

1463
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,580
But yeah, they should have...

1464
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:37,180
The dance school's kids should not have been there, and whoever that guy was wasn't kamami.

1465
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:38,180
He shouldn't have been there, either.

1466
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:39,820
Let me just put it this way, though.

1467
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:42,260
Any publicity is good publicity.

1468
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:45,300
That's very true, and you know, it's going to sell the game a little more.

1469
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:48,500
Maybe we will get an arcade machine in the US that's like Max 2, but...

1470
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:52,620
You know, we had the discussion about it, you know, it was me and I don't remember who

1471
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:56,860
I was talking to about it, but we were making the discussion that now that the whole Endo

1472
01:44:56,860 --> 01:45:04,220
Mirror suit's been settled, or is in process of settling, it opens the door for a new mix,

1473
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:11,100
And I don't think that necessarily that Konami themselves have to do the work on it.

1474
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:15,300
I mean if they're allowing third parties to do the arcade releases, they could just easily

1475
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,060
have a team set aside.

1476
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:22,740
I know, it's just kind of like, you just kind of want to know, you know, if you, if we were

1477
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,260
just in the know a little more, if we knew a little bit more about how that, all that

1478
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,860
operation works, you know, what goes on inside Konami's roof, inside Konami's Japan roof,

1479
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:34,620
inside of Comedy of America's Roof, it would probably make a lot more sense to us, and

1480
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,980
we wouldn't be so bitter about this game that we've wasted so much money on.

1481
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,700
The fact is we don't.

1482
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,480
And so we're just confused, and we don't get it.

1483
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:48,300
But luckily at least the home releases are moving in the right direction by far.

1484
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:52,100
So if they do end up doing a Max 2 in the U.S., which I don't see why they wouldn't,

1485
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,540
it'll probably kick a lot of ass.

1486
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:58,500
All right, CBS, yes.

1487
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,500
So, I guess we can talk about other smaller stuff that went on.

1488
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,500
Any other news you know?

1489
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:08,500
Well, we've got, of course, the eighth release of characters for DDRPC.

1490
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,500
Not that anyone ever plays that game anymore.

1491
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:15,500
I'm sure there are certain people that play that game, but I know for me...

1492
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,500
I did see this morning.

1493
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,500
I did not play this. I don't play this game anymore.

1494
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,500
It crashes on my computer and whatever.

1495
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
The newest character to be released?

1496
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,500
The newest characters that we have.

1497
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,220
I got two Latin people, I don't remember what their names are, it doesn't really matter.

1498
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,580
But the most important one is Jason Enos.

1499
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:35,580
Yes, Jason Enos is a playable character in DDR.

1500
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:39,820
Which we all pretty much knew about ever since the game came out that he would be released

1501
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:40,820
at some point.

1502
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:41,820
That's really cool, but his head is small.

1503
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:42,820
That's exactly what I said.

1504
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:44,760
His head is smaller than the rest of his body.

1505
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:48,120
Some graphic artist really fucked up on that.

1506
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,540
And his shirt looks like your shoes.

1507
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,540
That was cool.

1508
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,540
Dude, I love the shirt.

1509
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,540
I want that.

1510
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,700
The shirt was awesome, but he has a shrunken head.

1511
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,700
That's a real bummer.

1512
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,700
But it's still pretty neat.

1513
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:57,700
But I don't know.

1514
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,700
We didn't play it in-game.

1515
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,700
I haven't played it in-game yet.

1516
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,700
So he probably looks okay there.

1517
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:01,700
But that little preview picture of him.

1518
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:02,700
Whoops.

1519
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,820
It's still really cool.

1520
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:08,500
You know that you've made it when you are in DDR.

1521
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:13,420
DJ Konami is hoping that they release Kyle Snyder as a hidden character at some point.

1522
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:15,380
Probably not going to happen.

1523
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:17,300
And the Sky character, yes.

1524
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,300
And the Dark Sakura.

1525
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:21,420
Sky and Dark Sakura should be a team that comes up.

1526
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:22,420
No.

1527
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,060
But we'd have to have orange bats.

1528
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:27,060
Okay, if they gave us orange bats, would you be a DDR PC character?

1529
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,060
Okay, I would.

1530
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:32,220
But, you know, someone let us know if you can, you know, make skins for the characters

1531
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,220
or something.

1532
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:35,180
Let us know if anyone's figured out how to hack it.

1533
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,820
And then Loki can be in DDR PC, too, and he'll kind of have that big trench coat of his on

1534
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:44,060
doing that whole Keanu Reeves thing, whoa, I know DDR.

1535
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:47,060
Whoa, I forgot my steps.

1536
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:51,420
A little inside there.

1537
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:58,420
Other than that, some stuff is probably going to be announced, I'm not positive it's going to be announced next week, but that's when it's scheduled to be announced.

1538
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:02,420
Turning Mix 3! Yes, Turning Mix 3 is coming up.

1539
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:04,420
Oh, this would be the SimNews portion.

1540
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:10,420
Yes, SimNews, I guess. Turning Mix 3 is going to be started, so we're going to see a lot more Sim files, hooray!

1541
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:21,420
And, you know, this time around I'm expecting BemaniRuler not to enter, you know, unless, of course, you know, almost all of his files are out there except for one, and that's the return.

1542
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:25,420
And so, well, if he is gonna enter, it'll probably be that one.

1543
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:35,420
Which is a, you know, sounds like a cool file, but really, I think we're all sick of BemaniRuler. In fact, I believe part of yesterday's ranting on the radio was me ripping on BemaniRuler.

1544
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:43,420
Which, I don't give a shit because he's a punk as far as I'm concerned, but that's just my opinion.

1545
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:45,420
Loki gets on his soapbox!

1546
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:47,420
Yeah, okay, off my soapbox here.

1547
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:56,420
So, Turning Mix 3, they're talking about actually having prizes. There was going to be some DVDs provided by myself, but they never took me up on that and now it's too late.

1548
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:00,420
So, oh well, screw that, they're going to have to buy their own prizes.

1549
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:07,420
So there's probably going to be prices this time around. There might be a section where you actually have to pay to enter, so that's kind of crap, but whatever.

1550
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:14,420
This time, this time, unlike the last two times that I said I was going to enter, this time I will enter because I'm actually making sim files now.

1551
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:19,420
So you'll see something from me in there if it's not, you know, something that I've already made.

1552
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:23,420
So we'll see something from me in the tournament this time.

1553
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:29,420
I guess I can plug my site a little bit, you know, of course everyone knows about www.leechfromloki.tk

1554
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:35,420
I'm going to be uploading, probably tonight, my finished copy of Outer Limits.

1555
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:38,420
I finished that, no, actually yesterday.

1556
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:39,420
Yay!

1557
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:41,420
How did you have any time to finish that yesterday?

1558
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:45,420
Well, technically yesterday, if you consider like 1 a.m. yesterday.

1559
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,420
Oh, okay.

1560
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:51,420
And so, I finished that yesterday, so it's almost, it's all ready to go.

1561
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,420
I just need to upload it.

1562
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,420
It's kind of fun.

1563
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,420
Pretty difficult.

1564
01:49:54,420 --> 01:50:00,420
I tried playing it on the pad today and I just realized I can't do 10-footers on a pad, so yay.

1565
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,420
Other than that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs.

1566
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:09,420
They've got another user sim file section updated to where people can submit files now

1567
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:11,420
and you'll see a bunch of cool stuff come on there.

1568
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:17,420
Also, DDR UK, if you're not a member of that site, I recommend becoming one

1569
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:21,420
Who also you might know from his Bantu originals and that kind of thing.

1570
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:25,420
He actually is doing synced sets for DDR.

1571
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:32,420
He's got synced sets for EuroMix and EuroMix 2 full sets with MP3s and everything that you can download when you zip or by themselves.

1572
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:37,420
And also he has Disney's rave done and he's working on Club Mix and he's going to do the rest.

1573
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:44,420
And actually if you find his site, which I can't remember the URL by itself, he's got synced sets for Max 2 and DDR Max.

1574
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:57,420
He's got sync sets for Max 2 and DDR Max, and I think he had at one point all the other original one through fifth, but I have them, but they're not on the site anymore.

1575
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:01,420
So you'll have to find them somewhere else. But they're out there, so just keep looking.

1576
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:07,420
Other than that, I don't think there's any more updates with StepMania. I haven't heard anything.

1577
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:09,420
The final just got released.

1578
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:11,420
Some tumbleweed rolled by.

1579
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:17,420
The final got released a couple of weeks ago, so not too much going on there.

1580
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,420
Really, that's pretty much it.

1581
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:29,420
I know there's a few people still trying to find out a way to crack the DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing there.

1582
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:34,420
Something I've been working on for months and kind of giving up on because I don't play the arcade machines anymore.

1583
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:43,420
Maybe we'll crack that, and then I'll go play again and make some more edits, and I'm supposed to make some edits to be on SoCalKick's site, so look for those.

1584
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:48,420
That's pretty much it. Not too much going on this week. It's kind of dry. Hopefully we'll see you a little bit more this week.

1585
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:54,420
And always check in on Tuesday night to find out what Naoki's journal is going to be. Oh! That's right.

1586
01:51:54,420 --> 01:52:03,420
One other thing, not Simphile related, but DDR Extreme News. We did find out that there is another song announced. It's going to be...

1587
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:10,420
Love is the Power, which is the ending theme from DDR Second Mix, so that's going to be in there, another Naoki track.

1588
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:24,420
Also, as I mentioned earlier, in my FUs of the Week, Super Eurobeat, which is going to be done by Naoki, featuring the DDR All-Stars, which is Polteri, B4U, and some other chick, I can't remember the name.

1589
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:30,420
And so, yeah, you'll have to listen for that one, I'm sure it's going to sound like a train wreck.

1590
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:46,420
Also, a few more Oni courses, there's a really particular evil one that's got a bunch of slow songs like Bag and Orion78 played at half speed, so it's going to look like one giant mass of arrows coming up the screen that you can't read, so that'll be fun, I guess.

1591
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:56,420
Check Aaron in Japan's site, he's got a really cool comprehensive list on there, and his stuff's pretty updated really frequently, so go check that out.

1592
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,420
And that's pretty much it.

1593
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:04,060
Alright, well, we've got a few more minutes left in the show, and I thought what I'd do

1594
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:06,300
is open up the mailbag.

1595
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:12,640
We're going to open up the email mailbag right now on the station, so let's get some mailbag

1596
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,640
and music, shall we?

1597
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,640
Let's do it.

1598
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,640
I'll do it.

1599
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,060
Let me go ahead and make a mention of something while you're filling that out.

1600
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:19,060
Yes, please do.

1601
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,660
I'm working on a little something now that I have some spare time again.

1602
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,820
This tournament's over, thank God.

1603
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:31,980
Basically, go ahead and send in an email to OrangeChallengeRadio.com with what your favorite

1604
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,420
joke of the show is.

1605
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:43,940
That would be whether it's a Nalky's Diary, maybe, or maybe our hatred of Politary, or

1606
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:47,760
your favorite segment, or maybe even our listless segment.

1607
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:52,620
What is your favorite staple discussion of our show?

1608
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:59,620
go ahead and send that and just put attention DS for the subject and you may see something

1609
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,620
come of that over the next few weeks.

1610
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:08,220
Alright cool. The email address is orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com and we're going

1611
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,220
to go check the mailbag right now.

1612
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:17,220
Go into the mailbag. Go into the mailbag. Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.

1613
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:20,220
Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.

1614
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:24,220
Ah, I see this entire week we've gotten one new email.

1615
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:27,220
Hey, that's one more than we got last week.

1616
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:29,220
Yes, and a lengthy one it is, too.

1617
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:31,220
Yes, this is a great email.

1618
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:35,220
This comes to us from somebody who refers to themselves as

1619
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:41,220
Mask-kun of Suspenseful on behalf of the entire Closet Poppers Society.

1620
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:43,220
Now when I first read this, I thought,

1621
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:46,220
Closet Poppers, that sounds kind of like a rave thing.

1622
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,220
Read the letter.

1623
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,220
Let's read the letter.

1624
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:54,220
Good evening, I'm speaking for all of the members of the Closet Poppers Society, affectionately

1625
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:57,220
known in our inner circles as Judy's Basement.

1626
01:54:57,220 --> 01:55:00,220
And we as a whole listen to your radio station almost religiously.

1627
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,220
Well thank you.

1628
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,220
We love you.

1629
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:06,780
In fact, number 349, Sanchez, quartet of the mariachi, is such a fan that he maintains

1630
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:11,140
a small shrine to both of you, which is all, there is three of us now, thank you, which

1631
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:17,340
is located between the paint cams at his hardware store, which he is not at one of our meetings.

1632
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:24,340
Your 24-hour Bahmani words of wisdom inspire us all. I love people that can kiss some ass.

1633
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:30,020
We try our best to play every game that they make. Unfortunately, we feel that there may

1634
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:34,660
be major bias within those divine offices, and it is starting to get on the coalition's

1635
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:39,500
nerves just a tiny bit. What are we talking about? Basically, we've chalked up numerous

1636
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:45,060
hours of listen time, many thanks to Danny of Surf Punk and Yamye of Asian Ska, who took

1637
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:50,160
the time to set up the player, and on most occasions felt that each of the great Konami's

1638
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:54,100
honorable franchises has been fairly represented in regards to each other. If the collection

1639
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:58,740
of 2DX music began to eclipse that of Guitar Freaks or Keyboard Mania, the system would

1640
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:00,580
quickly be brought back into relative balance.

1641
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:06,260
Actually, I think we have more 2DX music than any of those, but I'm pretty sure we do, but

1642
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:07,260
I don't know if...

1643
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:09,260
But we do have a good selection of the others.

1644
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:26,260
Fair enough. We do have a good selection of most Bamani music. However, our society is mainly composed of pop and music 1 through 8 fans, and out of the many times we have tuned in, we have only heard maybe 2 or 3 songs out of the well over 350 that exist, and we feel that you're not doing the license any justice.

1645
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:28,260
If I can find pop and music songs...

1646
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:31,260
You know, I think I know a place where I can find some.

1647
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:36,260
I will make it my mission to download plenty of pop and music stuff for you guys.

1648
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:41,220
Alright, Jean-Marc of Arty Pop has been especially traumatized by the imbalance and keeps running

1649
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:45,180
into walls, rambling about buttons that never were.

1650
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:48,800
To make a long story short, we've come to beg you to add more pop and music tracks to

1651
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,900
the lineup.

1652
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:54,480
All we ask is maybe two to three a month until the series catches up to its brethren and

1653
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,880
its long-lived potential.

1654
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:00,400
We repeat, give the poppers the reparization they deserve.

1655
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,740
You asked for it, you got it.

1656
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,940
You asked for it, you got it.

1657
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:04,100
We've got the space for it, we can accommodate it.

1658
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:09,100
This week on Orange Lounge, Politary is out, Poppin' Music is in.

1659
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,100
But my personal request, we need Poppin' Music and the Melo stuff.

1660
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:17,100
I have to have the Cutie Honey theme on Orange Lounge Radio.

1661
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,100
We will make it our mission to go find ourselves some Poppin' Music.

1662
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:27,100
Of course, here on Orange Lounge, we always go out and buy the legit soundtracks before we put songs into rotation.

1663
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:35,100
Of course! So, we're going to go right now and order soundtracks!

1664
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:36,100
We will order them!

1665
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:44,100
And as soon as those ordered soundtracks are in our possession, we will replay them and play them for you.

1666
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:49,100
In fact, I will have mine rushed overnight so that they get here on time for this week.

1667
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:54,100
We will have them rushed overnight! Yes, we shall do that! That's a fabulous idea.

1668
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:58,100
We will make sure that they are sent by a special electronic courier.

1669
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:03,100
Yes. Yes, electronic courier. I like that idea.

1670
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:06,100
Alright.

1671
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:10,100
Okay, I'll repeat my comment. End the show. I have to go to the bathroom.

1672
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:15,100
Okay, we're going to end the show, but I need to queue up the music real fast.

1673
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:18,100
So, is this tonight's fortune cookie right there? Yes it is.

1674
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:23,100
Okay, so I need to ask really fast though if you guys have any final thoughts.

1675
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:45,100
1 Must Fall Battlegrounds

1676
01:58:53,100 --> 01:59:17,100
I want to hear the fortune cookie.

1677
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:21,660
They want to know the mailbag music. The mailbag music is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard

1678
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:29,540
Mania 2nd Mix. And Baquah is not on any DDR soundtracks. It's from the artist's CD, Lee

1679
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:35,900
Jung Hyun. And I'm too honky to pronounce that correctly. Good night!

1680
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:42,940
