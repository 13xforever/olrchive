2297	3197	Message for you, son!
3618	4338	Attention!
5499	8983	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10984	16049	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19682	22603	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22924	26105	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26665	29387	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29927	32828	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33608	34029	Just kidding.
34229	35809	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
36030	43493	In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?
43753	46194	That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.
46314	47895	What's your favorite scary?
49463	50063	Showgirls.
50944	52044	Absolutely frightful.
52365	53145	What's yours?
53185	55646	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55706	56967	Don't torture yourself.
57587	58648	That's my job.
58668	60329	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
60749	63491	I'll get you, my pretty.
63711	65031	And your little dog, too.
65412	66332	I know Kung Fu.
66692	69114	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69354	71215	Why did they have to take the word gang?
72816	75277	No one expects a Spanish exposition!
75737	76478	It's Kendo.
79400	81221	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
98277	102661	We are live and this is episode number 20 for November the 17th of 2002.
102921	104843	But not November 20th.
105143	108666	It is our second season premiere.
109587	110408	And that was most rejoicing.
110928	111709	Yay.
112089	113170	It's like fall sweeps.
114391	115272	It's sweeps week.
116713	118675	In this episode, Jamie's going to get married.
118695	120516	I don't.
120636	121317	Fuck you.
121537	122738	And Loki's going to have a baby.
125000	125280	No.
125300	125340	No.
128843	133746	You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most premier radio station of all things Bimani.
134467	136608	My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.
136708	140891	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
141191	143033	You know who better as DarkSakura.
146375	147716	Say hello to our newest co-host.
147776	149717	Well, not really because he's been here since the beginning.
149777	151218	It's our TechMassaLoki.
151598	152159	Hello, everybody.
153354	155695	and we have some special guests in studio tonight.
155775	165719	Say hello first off to a chat room frequenter, our chat cookie that has finally crossed to the other side of the monitor and he's here in the studio tonight.
165759	167320	Say hello to Black Lab, everybody.
167380	168561	Hello, everybody.
168761	169821	Now fear me!
171442	175163	And of course, as always, because we just can't get rid of him, it's Dave.
175584	176144	Hello.
178584	179385	Thank you for watching!
202311	203653	Love, I just gotta have it, I believe
349485	349546	and...
502795	508637	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
513159	515661	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
515821	516301	Here we are.
517472	519835	We, a little bit earlier than usual.
520275	523178	But that's the new game here, 6.30 to 9.30.
523939	525781	Because we're so bored and have nothing to do.
525801	528624	Yeah, we thought we'd share our boredom with the rest of you.
529264	530866	But I see that a lot of people caught on to it.
530906	532528	We've got a good amount of people on board right now.
532548	534590	Now Black Lab will burp the nations of the world.
535131	536872	Oh, Black Lab's going to do some burping for us?
536952	537193	Okay.
538614	539275	Um, no.
542489	548012	They're trying... The chat room... Oh, by the way, if you do want to join the chat room, it's super easy now because we have a brand new website.
548192	550193	Big thank you to SoCalKicks for helping out with that.
550453	551294	We are of you.
552274	555716	And we have a new chat thing on the website.
555756	559598	So just go to orangelounge.skie.cx Is it Java or Yava?
559898	560778	It's Yava.
560958	561359	Yava.
561639	564540	And Twen helped me out to figure out how we get a Java thing going.
564620	565681	So thank you to Twen, too.
565941	566121	Yes.
566161	566961	But I'm not going to kiss Twen.
567842	568002	No.
568963	569783	Oh, my phone's ringing.
574182	574523	My bad.
575184	576426	I'm not answering you on air, sorry.
576446	577427	That's my booty call.
577527	578910	Uh oh, Rob's got his booty call.
579050	579391	Whale.
586855	589896	So, the chat room right now, they're trying to get me to go to Vegas.
590736	594417	I think they want all of us to come to Vegas, really, to do a show on the road in Vegas.
595037	595637	Yeah, I know.
595798	603700	How are we going to... Well, I know that my buddy Irene, Rice Princess, she turned 21 this week, and now she's thinking about doing a Vegas trip.
603720	605960	Because it was supposed to be Reno this weekend.
605980	606841	We were all going to go to Reno.
607101	608641	Prostitution is legal in Vegas, right?
609561	613142	Prostitution is not legal in Vegas or Vegas County, I don't think.
613202	614203	But outside it is.
614823	615243	Sucks.
616849	617189	I'm sorry?
617609	619290	Isn't it legal in Nevada in general?
619990	621350	Yes, but certain cities have it.
621570	624271	There's like some big brothel that's right outside.
624291	625371	Mustang Ranch.
626171	627332	It's Mustang Ranch, man.
627672	636174	I remember the one time on Under Station Live, the show I used to do on Saturday nights, we actually called the Bunny Ranch and got an interview with some prostitutes at the Bunny Ranch.
636194	637074	It was great radio.
637734	640215	Maybe once we get that capability set up here, we can...
641408	643449	You want to interview some prostitutes, Jamie?
643469	643649	Sure.
644530	646050	What's it like to be a whore?
646891	648171	You are a whore, darling.
649292	656495	Speaking of whores, I made Jamie watch the best movie about Vegas that's ever been made.
657456	658136	Showgirls.
659116	659977	The motion picture.
660717	662738	Three hours of stripping crap.
662818	663579	It's so bad.
664499	668241	That's why it is fun to watch because it is so freaking horrible.
669121	670522	What's our folks from Saved by the Bell?
672868	678571	Jesse Spano was her... Well, it's Elizabeth Berkley is her real name, but she was Jesse Spano on Saved by the Bell.
678991	687036	She was most famous in one episode, which... Spazzy, I don't know if he's listening right now, but he was trying to send me an episode of this, and it's been sending, like, all night long.
688417	693579	He was sending me an episode of Saved by the Bell when Jesse has her caffeine pill addiction, and she breaks down.
693900	694920	I'm so excited!
695140	696001	I'm so excited!
696281	697842	I'm so scared!
699218	700659	Nobody else here watched Saved by the Bell?
700740	701160	Nobody.
702301	703102	You did, yes.
703122	705044	I knew somebody else here had to have seen it.
705064	711209	I used to be an avid Saved by the Bell fan when I was on TV, and then Saved by the Bell at college years, and then Saved by the Bell at the movies.
711229	712070	Okay, that's a little much.
712811	713271	You're a dork.
714633	715173	Shut up!
715193	717455	Because Zack's so dreamy.
718997	720278	It's like, Loki's a dork.
720578	723121	Who's running a radio station out of his house?
724702	725262	Hey, fuck you.
725282	725883	Not me.
726063	726863	I'm just visiting.
727143	728244	You're here, bastard.
728484	729385	That's all I have to say.
731846	732346	Yeah, there.
732386	735068	We got people in the chat room admitting that they used to watch that show.
735308	738270	I didn't watch Saved by the Bell because I think I was busy watching cartoons.
739871	741852	What cartoons were you watching instead of Saved by the Bell?
742072	743853	Saved by the Bell came on after all the cartoons.
743953	751177	I was taping Ronin Warriors in the morning while I was still asleep and then watching my tape when I got home in the afternoon after I watched all my other shows.
751710	752670	Well, aren't you special?
752890	753791	Yes, I am, quite.
754531	757932	Ah, Saved by the Bell, Tiffany Amber Thiessen.
757993	758393	Her debut.
758433	761194	Nah, Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, yes.
762594	763475	She was hot.
764915	765976	Now she's, like, stupid.
766456	767836	What show is she on now?
767896	769737	She's on some show on Fox, isn't she?
770157	771538	She was on, like... She was on 90210.
771658	772098	Yeah.
772138	775780	And now she's, like, in bit parts in B-movies and stuff.
777256	777737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
795680	798301	You know, I don't like to acknowledge the Ducks to Dunks sequel.
798741	799661	I mean, okay, okay.
799901	803802	Now, granted, number two did have Bruce Campbell in, so that made number two decent.
803942	804143	Ha!
804623	805343	I have to see that, then.
805643	807624	Bruce Campbell was in Sacramento last week, by the way.
807784	807924	What?
808504	810484	Yes, Bruce Campbell did a signing at Borders or something.
810584	811925	I just heard about it, like, last minute.
812205	812565	That's all right.
813345	817727	We saw him when he went to the crest and did, uh... Nah.
817767	818507	We saw Evil Dead.
818547	819267	There he is.
819847	822188	My friend has himself on videotape with Bruce Campbell at E3.
824308	825329	What was Bruce Campbell doing at E3?
825349	827270	Just because he's Bruce Campbell.
842400	842700	All right.
843260	848221	Well, we saw him when he was down at the Crust Theater, and it was pretty cool because he was doing signings and stuff.
848281	854503	And then they did a screening of Evil Dead 2, you know, Dead by Dawn, which was great.
855343	856523	Great movie.
856703	863624	It's really fun to watch in a theater full of people, especially people I've seen the movie before, because everyone's just all cheering at the right spots, you know.
863844	865185	And he's like, bullshit.
865525	866485	And everyone's like, yeah!
866505	866605	Yeah!
867905	880492	Why can't we get a screening of Showgirls at the Crest with, like, Elizabeth Berkley live and the chick who played the mama at the strip bar who had the... She'd go like that and her top would fly off and she was really ugly.
882113	884854	She can bump on... Oh, no, not the big fat chick.
884914	886335	I'm talking Elizabeth Berkley.
886355	891438	Hey, if we want to recreate... Elizabeth Berkley looks like a skank.
891858	891918	Ew.
892677	894418	Looks like my sister.
895498	897259	Quacks like a duck, must be a duck.
899480	899980	You don't care.
900220	901981	You can put a paper bag on her head.
902181	902862	Hey, don't ruin it.
907091	907651	Make, Edit, Get Porn
927158	928839	and you send that edit to me in any form.
929239	938084	I mean, you can make the edit with a Japanese version of, you know, a DDR game that happens to have the same song that, you know, is in DDR Max USA.
938124	947388	DWI, you make an .sm file, just some way to get step chart, some way to get it to me and then, you know, I'll take care of the rest and send you out a big box of porn.
948249	949089	That's how it works.
949769	953972	I tried proposing this to the DDR Maniacs forums and they just didn't get it.
953992	954692	They're all...
954992	957113	I like the idea of an edit contest, but why porn?
958813	962274	Because I've done other edit contests before and they're like, but why porn?
962294	963955	Because everything else has been done.
964055	965395	Yo, can you do a normal edit?
966556	967276	I want boys.
967356	968696	Well, sorry, I don't have that.
969397	972518	We will find a way to maybe donate some boy porn to the contest.
972578	973938	We'll see if we can figure something out.
974598	978619	We don't know if we'll have DVDs necessarily, but we'll get boy porn in one way or another.
978679	980320	Just for the ladies, okay?
982071	982751	All right, well, anyways.
983592	984332	Oh, go ahead, Dave.
984492	989335	Instead of, like, getting boy porn for the winner, how about just donate boy porn to Jamie?
989355	992276	Because I don't think anyone else, including me, would want boy porn.
992897	998280	Now, now, we're neglecting some locals like Anita, DDRholic, Rice Princess.
1000041	1000321	I don't know.
1000341	1002022	There's folks out there that might want boy porn.
1002042	1002382	Who knows?
1002742	1003282	I don't get it.
1003383	1012448	If, you know, guys are, can talk about, you know, just all girl porn, you know, why can't we have our all boy porn?
1013449	1014470	I'm not saying that you can't.
1014490	1019313	I'm just saying that, well, would you want girl porn, like girl on girl, girl on girl action?
1020313	1024676	Because homosexuality is wrong and fags go to hell, but being a lesbian is okay.
1025537	1027278	I, I don't.
1027941	1031923	I don't find fake body parts okay to be that attractive.
1032003	1033924	I like seeing pretty boys with nice abs.
1034204	1035724	They're not fake, they're enhanced.
1036685	1039126	I'll have you know those are ab implants, okay?
1040006	1048330	Now, but anyways, if I got free guy porn, then sure, I'd throw in free guy porn, but I just get free girl porn, so that's what's going in the box.
1049831	1053554	But yeah, no one did understand why I was doing a contest to get porn.
1053614	1054776	I was like, because it's funny.
1054896	1055917	Because it's porn!
1056097	1057018	Because it's fun!
1057038	1061962	They're all, why don't you do a normal contest with regular prizes?
1062223	1067508	So first I kind of caved for about a minute, and I said, eh, fuck them.
1068028	1071492	You want a normal at a contest, go enter Turnham Mix 3 or whatever.
1072292	1074494	This is a pornographic edit contest.
1074954	1079098	It's called Make Edit Get Porn, not Make Edit Get Something Not Porn.
1079178	1084362	I should have made that rule that all the titles for the edits have to be sexually ambiguous.
1084662	1086123	P-E-R-0-N.
1087865	1088305	Prawn.
1089986	1093469	If JB wins it, he'll try to deep fry it and you'll have deep fried prawn.
1102229	1106591	No, but seriously, there'll be quite a bit of stuff in this box here.
1106631	1109512	That might be the slight problem, though.
1109912	1116595	Obviously, this contest is only open for anyone of age that can view porn in your state or county.
1116875	1121017	As long as, if you enter, I'm assuming that you're of age and that you're... Or convincing enough to lie about it.
1121357	1124440	Yes, if you enter, I am assuming that you're of age.
1124480	1125681	Do not tell me otherwise.
1125781	1126982	It's don't ask, don't tell.
1127262	1132166	If you cannot have pornography mailed to your house, don't enter.
1132546	1135169	Remember, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.
1136189	1138992	Yes, and we're not talking about a little bit of porn.
1139032	1140493	We're talking a lot of porn.
1140533	1148680	So, this is going to... We'll arrange, you know, transportation of the porn to your house, but...
1149076	1150637	We'll arrange a nice brown paper bag.
1151038	1151238	Yes.
1151258	1155421	Like, not a little bit of porn, like a whole two and a half days worth of porn.
1155942	1156542	That's a lot.
1158104	1159745	It will paint a little green door on the package.
1163669	1174018	Anyways, yeah, so the contest is still on, I have no entrance yet, but I haven't even announced a date for it, so... So, I mean, you know, whenever, I'll think of a date.
1174138	1176239	In the meantime, just get your edits ready and...
1177848	1194097	Even though a lot of people aren't entering, like, haven't signed up or whatever for entering, I know that there is a lot of hype going on, especially within the Sakpamani forums, about people wanting to enter this, such as Orange Beanie and me and other people.
1194137	1198000	This isn't restricted just to Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento.
1198100	1198820	It's everybody.
1198920	1199581	Nationwide.
1199661	1200461	International.
1201001	1201662	International.
1202522	1204824	If you live in Belgium and you want prawn, enter.
1204864	1208166	As long as you have the right region for your DVD player, or a good hack.
1208286	1210387	Oh yeah, that's a good point though, because they're all U.S.
1210407	1210767	region DVDs.
1210787	1213869	You don't have to actually limit it to the continental United States.
1214870	1215750	What about Canada?
1217751	1221974	It's just that it gets a little expensive to ship stuff to other countries.
1222134	1222654	Oh, that's true.
1222955	1223635	Continental U.S.
1223655	1223955	then only.
1223975	1225016	Continental U.S., yes.
1225965	1230686	Maybe, if somebody internationally wants to enter, maybe we'll just send you some net porn.
1231167	1232467	We'll send you a few dirty pictures.
1233847	1236268	I'll arrange something, yeah, for those who can't do that.
1239549	1246631	I actually found, you know, this is really sad, is someone made a Nintendo 64 emulated porn.
1247712	1249052	A Nintendo 64 porn?
1249072	1250433	What is that, Mario Party or something?
1250653	1253934	No, it's just like, I don't know, it's like they made a ROM file with porn in it.
1254574	1254974	It's weird.
1255481	1255962	Wahoo.
1256723	1258244	They have those for Super Nintendo.
1258505	1259927	There's like 30 pictures in them.
1260147	1263811	I downloaded this ROM that was labeled as this game I wanted and it was porn.
1264773	1265153	Cool.
1265513	1268157	It was like big, you know, twat shot porn.
1268497	1268637	Ew.
1268697	1268938	I don't...
1272061	1274204	Need to see pixelated cooter, okay?
1276067	1277208	Plus they had an option.
1278029	1282475	I guess what it does is it activates the rumble pack for a very long time.
1282755	1284618	It has the vibrate function.
1285739	1288082	So that was really weird, but yeah.
1289524	1290045	It's out there.
1290447	1296633	You have no idea how many times I, like, click on something for Kazaa, and it's like, Initial D, episode 22.
1296673	1301497	Click on, oh, oh, wait, that's not Initial D, that looks like porn.
1302038	1303919	Not Initial D. Yeah, that pissed me off.
1303979	1307623	I was trying to find Jackass, the movie, and I ended up getting Sorority Boys.
1308543	1310005	Yeah, then you see the male ass.
1310025	1311206	I was like, no!
1311226	1315790	Of course, I'm downloading Chamber of Secrets right now, because I didn't get to go today.
1317700	1319123	Oh, you and your Harry Potter.
1319163	1319965	Speaking of porn.
1320746	1321748	Just kidding.
1323111	1325576	Speaking of porn, Harry Potter, come on.
1326377	1327800	I got lost.
1327880	1329283	Although I do know where to get to, didn't you?
1331061	1332321	How was Harry Potter anyway?
1332521	1333862	Very, very good.
1334022	1334242	Really?
1334282	1338805	We're planning on having a trip again to go see it sometime very soon if you want to come and join in on the action.
1338865	1339325	Yeah, sure.
1339846	1342387	Lots of me drooling over Alan Rickman on screen.
1342787	1343808	Yay, Alan Rickman on screen.
1343828	1345429	God, he was so fabulous.
1345849	1348210	But I don't think of him as fabulous like that.
1352526	1353487	Yeah, Harry Potter.
1353767	1354047	Word.
1354427	1356689	Oh, speaking of... Go from porn to Harry Potter.
1356789	1360052	Speaking of pornography, no, I have something that still goes along the lines of pornography.
1360092	1362814	This has kind of been circulating a lot of the web boards this week.
1363562	1367964	We've been given this link that talks about the DDR up the skirt camera.
1369144	1375427	I don't know if you guys, I'll post the link in the chat room for those that maybe haven't seen this, although I think it's been whored out on just about every forum out there.
1375507	1377928	Not to mention at least five live journals.
1377948	1379529	Yeah, like different live journals and such.
1379589	1382470	But just in case, there's the link in the chat room for you guys.
1382910	1389533	It's basically a pornography where it shows these Japanese schoolgirls, of course they're dressed like Catholic schoolgirls, you wouldn't have it any other way.
1389553	1390633	Sailor dresses.
1391053	1392254	Yeah, they all look like Sailor Moon.
1392934	1398456	and there's a little camera right in the center of a DDR pad that films up their skirt.
1398977	1400737	They even have a diagram illustrating where the camera is.
1400777	1404339	Yeah, it just points out, you know, insert camera here.
1405239	1406240	It's a big black dot.
1406700	1409881	Now, we should translate this page, shouldn't we?
1410101	1412262	I should run this through the translator because I haven't done that yet.
1412322	1412682	Let's see.
1413803	1416324	What do you guys think of this while I get it translated?
1418110	1419431	It has to do it really well, and...
1447856	1449659	I don't think it's really that working.
1449919	1450360	Let's see.
1451822	1454505	This is the English translation of the website.
1454525	1458371	Should we do some reading of the English translation of the website here?
1458531	1459132	Go for it.
1459232	1461515	Alright, I'm trying to get some website reading music here.
1461836	1463438	Yeah, but I just don't see how, like...
1464485	1470089	I mean, I can think of that you could hide the camera pretty well, but how many girls wear, like, mini skirts in play?
1470109	1473592	I don't think I've ever seen a girl wear a skirt or a mini skirt in play.
1473772	1476374	All right, let's hear what this porn cam site's advertising here.
1476394	1479816	Meanwhile, we have, like, the guys all ogling at the screen.
1484976	1486736	Make It Wait, ah, carried out.
1487337	1491919	A Playwoman quantity student's lower half of the body, collection of images of a shock.
1492239	1494920	The fourth cartridge, a ban, is removed at last.
1495620	1500122	This time it photographs before the first game in series and photography is ventured.
1502403	1505765	What surrender women quantity student with sufficient super qua?
1508268	1510589	Lump, T-Back, Photography, a success!
1510869	1516991	Let's hear it for Nifty at Global Gate.
1518091	1521792	The woman quantity students aimed at this time total six sets.
1522392	1526733	It clicks on each lower photograph and is to a verification page.
1526953	1528414	I don't know if that's like letting me view.
1530853	1531734	Oh, close-ups!
1532695	1534416	Look, it's... Oh, ass!
1534656	1535197	Let's see.
1536538	1536738	K.O.
1536818	1541362	are the women who show splendid dancing, like, while swaying the flair.
1541682	1546346	Well, we can tell it... It seems to be the dance of a proposal of marriage completely.
1547086	1548527	Okay, well, let me just put it this way.
1548787	1552410	They haven't been playing DDR very long, so they got some serious roles in that ass.
1552430	1555172	People like to be...
1557321	1562128	The whiter panties to the upper one of the leg extended smoothly, which seemed to be warm.
1562228	1563450	It is a fortunate shot.
1566033	1568897	Is it noticed that a camera is... Japanese.
1569858	1570760	Exciting moment.
1572943	1574285	She's looking right down at the camera.
1575183	1580387	A Supa Mini and loose exquisite balance and snow white panties cannot be removed too!
1581207	1583889	You wanna hear something very ironic about this whole thing?
1584209	1590174	There's no way that they wouldn't show anything other than a panty shot because it's illegal to show anything like that in Japan in the first place.
1590254	1590814	It totally blurs out.
1590834	1592455	Doesn't this look like a cooter right there?
1592755	1594677	Like this chick's not wearing underwear?
1595399	1596559	But is it just the lighting?
1599220	1600160	No, I can't click on it.
1600900	1602601	Let's see, I'm trying to look at more verification page.
1602641	1605181	See if we can see some... Oh, I don't know.
1609222	1611683	It's just white panties everywhere.
1615883	1617044	So it doesn't say how to order.
1618884	1619244	Does it?
1619344	1620104	Let me click on one of these.
1620124	1621145	Let's see how we order one.
1622325	1622725	Why?
1624281	1625882	Because we want to see how much they cost.
1626243	1627544	We're going to have one shipped to your house.
1627904	1628264	No!
1634729	1635250	Let's see.
1635570	1637531	It's loading.
1637571	1639153	No, it's not giving me shit.
1639493	1641394	Why would you want shit?
1642996	1643256	Oh well.
1647181	1648081	What are you pointing at?
1648822	1649342	Oh, the link.
1649482	1650502	Oh, it's a Shockwave file.
1650542	1651342	I don't know what I'm going to get.
1651642	1652042	Let's see.
1652322	1653322	Okay, so that's enough of that.
1653382	1655943	Let's click on this Shockwave file I've been getting.
1658463	1661264	So, any chance we'll ever see a series like this in America?
1662304	1663684	Panty Panty Revolution?
1664924	1669885	I don't know about that, but I'm sure they could put the Girls Gone Wild chicks on there, jumping around.
1671086	1672846	Just take a DDR machine and Mardi Gras.
1674614	1675555	and let fun ensue.
1677736	1678977	I see prophets!
1680378	1680599	Anyways.
1682660	1685162	I have no idea what this is that I just got in the chatroom.
1686103	1687083	It's a fish with legs.
1687444	1689866	It's a fish with legs and it's speaking a lot of Japanese.
1690006	1699333	He has a fish for a head and he's wearing a loincloth and a cape.
1701897	1702718	Kikkoman!
1702758	1704379	Yeah, it's like a soy sauce.
1704399	1705679	Yes, they can.
1705719	1708921	Did he just shoot a laser out of his nipple?
1708941	1710722	There's a kitty eating a fried egg.
1727759	1732086	Show me, show you, show me, show you Show me, show you, show you, show me
1743191	1744291	They look like little kittens.
1744692	1745912	They look like fried kittens.
1746833	1748033	Did you just say pussy?
1748053	1749214	Number one soy sauce.
1749234	1749814	What the hell?
1749834	1750014	Yikes.
1771832	1774493	Oh, somebody hung the kitten.
1774533	1775294	How sad.
1776414	1780937	That was homoerotic right there.
1782238	1784879	That was brawn right there.
1787540	1789341	A banana, a mushroom, and a fish.
1790642	1792623	Ice cream popsicle.
1796385	1797766	See, isn't that homoerotic right there?
1799980	1801201	That was beautiful.
1801281	1803042	I'm inspired to go eat sushi now.
1806683	1807884	Suggestion in the chatroom.
1807904	1809645	They should make Douche Douche Revolution.
1810905	1813167	What else is the chatroom saying?
1813187	1814127	Strip Strip Revolution.
1814467	1815808	Girls Gone Wild DDR.
1815888	1817309	Lose a song, take your top off.
1818469	1819230	Strip DDR.
1822411	1824052	You probably have to get the girls drunk first.
1825715	1833540	Actually, I was talking to someone that, uh, used to know the people that did the Girls Gone Wild, uh, tapes, and, yeah, that's what they do, is get them drunk first.
1835141	1839464	Uh, Jamie, uh, we're getting a suggestion about maybe boy porn for the DDR, same thing.
1839784	1846108	You never know when guys might be free-balling and wearing baggy shorts, so... Ooh!
1846969	1848430	Pantsless rage indeed.
1848470	1850832	Don't you think they'd be able to feel the breeze a little bit?
1852573	1854354	It's like DDR-ing in the nude, Jesus.
1856454	1857274	Wouldn't it be painful?
1858055	1858755	I would think so.
1859616	1860656	How would it be painful?
1861357	1864038	Floppy, floppy, floppy.
1864238	1868100	If you're a woman and you have big boobs, you'd be whacking yourself in the face.
1868640	1875944	Once, me and Pauliver, one of the first times I played, I went down to the Riptide Arcade, the old one.
1876465	1878266	Before it was the Riptide Arcade or whatever.
1878566	1880726	The old place in Pier 39, before it moved.
1881426	1886008	And there was this one girl who was playing and her boobs were bouncing up and down so much.
1886028	1888388	She was like Jiggle Jiggle Revolution, I think we called it.
1889269	1890269	I need to go throw up now.
1890289	1891909	I think I saw a freestyle like that the other day.
1892229	1893770	I need to go throw up a lot now.
1894363	1895504	Are we going to take a quick break and come back?
1895524	1896204	Yeah, let's take a quick break.
1896244	1899246	Okay, we're going to take a really quick break and we'll come right back.
1899606	1902268	And when we come back, we'll get off the pornography subject.
1902528	1904269	Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah right.
1905069	1908712	And we'll talk to Black Lab a little more because he's our special guest.
1908752	1910253	So we have to interview him while he's here.
1910793	1914135	So I'm going to get to a request that we had in the chat room a little bit earlier.

2433603	2434504	...vaguely twatty.
2435924	2437445	Did you just say it sounds twatty?
2438553	2439573	Yes, I did!
2440474	2448056	If you're just now joining us, a friendly reminder, Orange Lounge Season 2 debuted tonight, and we start the show a half hour earlier now.
2448536	2449817	And we run it a half hour later.
2449937	2450457	Is that on?
2450737	2452598	Which means it's three hours long.
2452618	2453238	No, the webcam is on.
2453258	2455459	Okay, because people would be looking at my feet right now.
2457199	2460160	The big show starts now at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.
2460400	2461281	So wake up earlier.
2461821	2462061	Yes.
2462761	2463902	Get your ass here earlier.
2465422	2466022	Hi, Black Lab.
2466062	2466462	How are you?
2467063	2467943	Let's talk to Black Lab.
2468504	2469625	It's our favorite puppy.
2470426	2471387	Yeah.
2471447	2472348	Good puppy.
2474090	2474391	Sit.
2475272	2476333	Sit, Ubu, sit.
2476693	2478095	I'm already on the ground, dammit.
2478855	2480197	Yes, because you can't have my chair.
2481879	2483621	Black Lab's already sitting here on his knees.
2485483	2486163	Don't go there!
2487577	2488617	Don't go there.
2516329	2516569	Yes?
2516649	2516970	Yes.
2517210	2526880	I had my experience working at Castro Valley Golf Land and I know it's small and I know it's probably most people consider it ghetto because Milpitas and Sunnyvale are much bigger.
2527040	2527881	Living in the ghetto.
2528642	2530984	It's not really ghetto, it's more like, well, it's Castro Valley.
2533612	2537519	It's like a white and partially Latino hood.
2538780	2539181	Okay.
2539341	2540924	And it's up in the hills.
2541104	2542707	It's not like down in the city area.
2543107	2544129	It's not even a real city, though.
2544670	2547113	So, what kind of Bomani games do they have in Castro Valley?
2548018	2552582	Oh, we have the usual standard Max 2s.
2553103	2554464	Oh, we have a 3rd Korean, yeah!
2554925	2556046	Don't see many of those anymore.
2556646	2558168	And then we also have a 4th Plus.
2559269	2564113	Oh yeah, a US version of Guitar Freaks and a Beat Stage 5th Mix.
2564914	2566535	With a discolored screen, I might add.
2566596	2568738	What exactly did you used to do at Castro Adolfo?
2568758	2569979	You weren't a tech, you just...
2570559	2573620	I was general maintenance.
2574020	2576361	I made sure the place didn't collapse on itself.
2577481	2580542	Now, were you there for the big tournament they did at Caster Valley a couple months ago?
2581102	2583403	Oh, yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
2584203	2585203	Most people probably don't know this.
2585563	2588704	If it weren't for me, that whole thing would have fallen flat on its frickin' face.
2588844	2589445	Oh, I see.
2590985	2591765	Ego, ego.
2592425	2593426	No, I'm serious though.
2594146	2604888	I was like the main link to the management and it kind of got screwed over at the last minute without my knowledge because I was trying to make sure that the machine would be going outside for the tournament.
2605269	2610790	But no, the manager changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to tell anyone until the next morning.
2611270	2619012	When I'm there an hour before the place even opens to get this machine moved outside and the supervisor that morning comes in and is like,
2619549	2620810	Oh, the machine's not going outside.
2621591	2623572	And I'm like, oh shit.
2624813	2635782	And I pretty much damn near killed myself trying to make sure there was enough room for people to be in there, and I ended up missing pretty much the entire tournament because I had a migraine from nearly killing myself.
2636502	2636722	Ouch.
2636742	2637763	Oh, I'm sorry.
2638724	2640806	And then I had to come and clean up after you bastards!
2641546	2642907	I didn't go, so you didn't clean up after me.
2644128	2646350	And why didn't we have any fucking music playing during that?
2647523	2648784	That's not really as fuck you.
2648804	2649685	That's not really as fuck you.
2649725	2651247	That's as fuck you of like three months ago.
2651267	2652428	That's not the fuck you of this week.
2652948	2653829	We'll get to those later.
2654390	2655311	Post-dated FU.
2655851	2657673	Well, you have to catch up.
2657713	2660436	You usually send about ten FUs of the week every week, so.
2660776	2662397	Well, it's been kind of going down lately.
2663418	2664720	You're getting a little happier with life.
2665460	2665760	A little.
2666060	2670381	But so now you've moved from Castro Valley to the wide, wonderful... I didn't live in Castro Valley.
2670921	2674782	I lived in San Leandro, which is like... Which is right nearby, obviously, if you were to Castro Valley, right, okay.
2675142	2676982	But you've moved basically to Sacramento.
2677022	2682843	You don't live in Sacramento, but you live in the People's Republic of Davis, which is a small hippie town just, you know, right outside of Sacramento.
2683443	2683723	With a college!
2683743	2683903	Oh, wow.
2683923	2685284	Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
2687624	2688724	Abandon hope I have.
2689344	2691965	So how does Davis differ than the Bay Area for you?
2692665	2693065	It's full...
2695134	2696375	You get a fine for breathing.
2698037	2701439	Davis, by the way, the town that arrested the lady for snoring too loud, I think.
2701920	2704262	Wasn't that Davis?
2704302	2705203	I didn't hear anything about Davis.
2705663	2706264	That was years ago.
2706344	2707505	It was probably before you were born.
2707745	2710747	Pretty little flat college town with absolutely nothing in it.
2711728	2713129	And it's boring as hell.
2713770	2718974	And the college sucks because they aren't letting first year students have their cars when there's plenty of parking.
2719695	2720656	And I'm hating it.
2721226	2721486	and Calamari
2738140	2740101	Yeah, it would be shrimp too, but they ran out of the shrimp there.
2740121	2747344	It's sad, but... But it's a max one there, and it's like, the volume's not that loud, and... Yeah.
2747924	2749184	So how did you get into playing DDR?
2749224	2754706	Was it something... Were you working at CBGL before Bomani got big and they got the game one day?
2755247	2762089	No, I... Listen, it was almost two years ago when I started, when I actually first played DDR.
2762249	2763330	Where did you first play DDR?
2763890	2765510	At Caster Valley Golf Land, as a matter of fact.
2765550	2765811	Oh, okay.
2765851	2766131	All right.
2767271	2773934	I just played the USA mix there and failed, stomped to my beat on my first song, and yeah, I was pretty much hooked after that.
2775174	2778776	And I've lost many hours and many 20s since then.
2779876	2784938	And now, you didn't get the job at Golfland so you could play more free DDR, did you?
2785238	2786058	Because that's sad.
2786699	2787259	No, I didn't.
2788139	2790360	Yeah, I needed a tour.
2790760	2797681	I knew people that were there, and they knew me, and it made it easier to get a job there for a summer job to get money to go to college.
2798821	2805823	I mean, the free only $20 in tokens every two weeks that I got wasn't that big.
2807263	2808824	But hey, at least I got to play some stuff.
2809984	2810204	Yeah.
2810584	2810844	Cool.
2812361	2813942	Alright, that's Black Lab, everybody.
2814463	2814823	Yay.
2815944	2816244	Alright.
2817625	2819727	So, what do we talk about now?
2819927	2821449	We gotta fill three hours in this bitch.
2821469	2823931	This is the moment on Orange Lounge where we yodel.
2825572	2827013	Give the mic to Loki, he's got something to say.
2827994	2831977	Has anyone out there seen that show, um, Three South?
2832758	2833559	Three South?
2833699	2835120	No, what station's that on?
2835360	2835720	MTV.
2836481	2837302	No, I don't watch crap.
2838194	2839435	I broke the clip again.
2839795	2843356	Okay, anyways, no, it's this really cool cartoon.
2844276	2845357	Do you want the clip or the mic?
2845377	2846978	I want the clip.
2847658	2851719	Anyways, so it's this really pretty funny show, actually.
2851779	2857742	It's the new cartoons they have on there, and it's about these three college guys, and from what I gathered, they're pretty retarded.
2858722	2860303	SoCalKick says it's stupid.
2861315	2861916	I watched it.
2861936	2862616	It was funny.
2863257	2865319	Your opinion counts for Jack.
2865859	2866360	Anyways.
2867160	2868582	So, it was pretty funny.
2869623	2872806	Today's episode is about constructing the Stomach Pump 2000.
2875048	2875568	Right.
2876409	2878350	Is that like Sorority Life, but animated?
2879852	2882274	With less bitching and no hot chicks.
2882294	2883835	Sorority Life was set in Davis.
2885077	2886498	That's something Davis is famous for.
2887304	2901376	Yeah, now we know publicly that there's plenty of bitches in, uh, fucking Davis Yeah, and that really helps me a lot Uh-huh Yeah I'm sorry to interrupt, you were talking about some crappy show on MTV?
2903746	2905247	It was entertaining, okay?
2905427	2907448	I mean, I had fun watching it.
2907969	2909530	I now know it's on Thursdays.
2909610	2916394	It gives me something to watch on Thursdays before I'm waiting for, I don't know, the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
2916594	2918575	Now that's quality television.
2918595	2919616	That show owns.
2920376	2921157	I love that show.
2922277	2923158	I don't know where the pin is.
2923418	2924459	I lost the pin.
2925279	2926160	I broke the clip again.
2927021	2930083	Didn't you think some of the older animated shows on MTV were much better, though?
2930143	2938169	Like Beavis and Butthead, Aeon Flux, Liquid Television that brought birth to both of those two shows.
2938189	2938509	Yes.
2939810	2940571	Because that rocked.
2941291	2944255	Frog Baseball Ciffle and Ollie
2958570	2959751	I've never heard of that.
2959771	2960911	Oh my god, it was the shit.
2961171	2962712	I think it's still online somewhere.
2962772	2964673	I just, I haven't followed up on it.
2964693	2967095	It was a show that did all of two shows of this on MTV.
2967635	2971077	The Idiot Box with Alex Winter, as in Bill and Ted Fane.
2971918	2972058	Ah.
2972558	2975660	I just remember the one show where he got shot in the head at the beginning of it.
2976000	2977701	And so the whole episode he was bleeding.
2978721	2982944	And he didn't realize it until he reaches up to scratch his head and then he goes, Ah, I'm bleeding!
2982984	2983264	And dies.
2985003	2988284	Well, then there was those two other shows that we probably want to forget about.
2988304	2988944	The State.
2989184	2989685	The State.
2989945	2991925	Oh, The State was like the best.
2991985	2992605	Okay, sorry.
2992866	2994406	I'm talking about animated shows.
2994626	2996047	We're talking like The Head.
2996367	2997207	I liked The Head.
2998247	2999128	I liked The Head.
2999188	2999648	Fuck you.
3000028	3000628	She likes Head.
3000928	3004529	Anyways, and then there's also The Max.
3005210	3006050	The Max was cool, too.
3007922	3016524	I like when they were talking about the Izzes, the ones that were just like, I think it was the Izzes, the stupid slugs that would jump like 50 feet in the air and then couldn't land.
3017284	3018585	They'd jump and just splat.
3018845	3019365	It was cool.
3020025	3021565	You know what we need an animated series of?
3022026	3023226	Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
3024266	3025306	Well, we have Zim.
3026147	3026947	Oh, fuck that, dude.
3026967	3028927	Johnny the Homicidal Maniac would be awesome.
3030428	3030908	Maybe later.
3031208	3032608	Like Little Shorts of Happy Noodle Boy.
3034289	3035929	Just Happy Noodle Boy would even be good.
3039086	3044789	The chatroom, Vandalist in the chatroom is asking, does anybody remember a show on Nickelodeon called Turkey Television?
3045530	3045910	Barely.
3046571	3047451	I barely remember it too.
3047471	3048572	I remember not liking it.
3048852	3051974	I remember the name, but like, barely anything about it.
3054856	3055857	I used to watch Out of Control.
3057358	3059579	Was that the one that the guy went cut it out?
3059719	3060059	Was that?
3060499	3061039	Yeah, in a head.
3061079	3061419	Yes.
3062119	3062379	Diz.
3062999	3063299	Yes.
3063639	3064500	The one that looked like Cyndi Lauper.
3064520	3065060	She would tell her story.
3065160	3065300	Yes.
3065400	3065680	Yes.
3066100	3066900	Oh, that show was the shit.
3066920	3068680	And the guy looked like Mark Summer from Double Dare, but it wasn't.
3068800	3069040	Yes.
3069341	3070181	I know what you're talking about.
3070241	3071301	It was the guy from Full House.
3071681	3072661	He did the cut it out.
3072881	3073141	Yeah.
3073281	3074342	I hella remember that show.
3074822	3076702	And I remember seeing Atlantis.
3077082	3079423	As long as we're reminiscing about old school TV.
3079463	3079923	And Pinwheel.
3079963	3080883	What else are they talking about here?
3081543	3082683	Funhouse with J.D.
3082743	3083743	Ross, man.
3084624	3086204	That show was awesome.
3086664	3089706	That show fucking ruled.
3089726	3093187	I had a computer game of Funhaus.
3093227	3094248	That was the shit.
3094308	3098510	I was actually looking up stuff about Funhaus this week, and they had a J.D.
3098570	3102852	Ross fan club, and man, talk about that guy being fucking homo.
3103913	3106174	That guy was like a homo pedophile, I swear to God.
3106194	3111397	He's sending photos of him just all sprawled out for children to enjoy.
3111417	3115239	As Loki's imitating the pictures here in the corner of the room.
3116299	3118101	That guy was sad.
3118321	3119282	That guy was really sad.
3119322	3122544	I mean, he was like one step below Vanilla Ice.
3123284	3124926	And just horrible.
3124986	3126827	I remember that show, but remember that J.D.
3126887	3128789	Roth was also the host of GameProTV.
3131611	3133952	Well, I just brought this show to a screeching halt with that name.
3134233	3134373	No.
3136757	3138839	I have to say, though, that Funhaus was awesome.
3139680	3144183	It was kind of funny, though, because some of the prizes that they had to get, they had to stick to their head with, like, Velcro.
3144624	3156233	It was like they'd have giant, like, boxes with the brand new Nintendo system, so they'd just, you know, stick that to their head, and they'd have to run out, and they'd get, like, cash and money and prizes and shit, and it was awesome.
3156773	3157634	That show was awesome.
3158094	3159516	Ah, you'll appreciate this one, Jamie.
3159556	3160757	I know you knew this show.
3160817	3163739	Skyline's asking if you remember a show called Out of This World.
3163799	3164099	Yes.
3164500	3175408	It was, ding, you put your fingers together and... Okay, in my live journal, one of my old icons was Troy, her dad, in his prismatic thingam-thingy.
3176049	3179732	The show, the 280 shows I remember, because they used to be on back-to-back.
3180032	3181473	Small Wonder, thank you very much.
3181613	3182554	That show was the shit.
3183095	3183635	With Vicky.
3184115	3187178	And the girl I used to actually have a crush on, Punky Brewster.
3187523	3188724	Punky Brewster was cool.
3190684	3191725	Soleil Moon Frye.
3192405	3194526	Dude, did you hear Soleil Moon Frye had to get a boob job?
3194566	3196567	She got her boobs reduced because they were so big.
3196947	3199108	I just couldn't believe that, that Punky Brewster had big tits.
3199128	3201469	Because, you know, when you saw her, she had no tits.
3201909	3205091	Because she was five or something.
3206071	3207172	Twelve, you know.
3207192	3209113	It doesn't matter.
3212368	3215209	You know, speaking, we've kind of been talking about game shows and TV shows.
3215249	3224191	Did you ever hear those rumors a while back that they were filming a pilot for a Dance Dance Revolution game show, which has to be the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my entire life.
3224531	3226611	A load of crap.
3226831	3227412	Exactly.
3227492	3228852	It's even a bad joke.
3229172	3232253	You know, that took off about as well as, uh, the DDR movie?
3234153	3236176	It was the DDR Freak movie, remember?
3236296	3238318	Yes, it was a movie called DDR Freak.
3238358	3244105	I've seen the supposed script for it, and it was bull and shit at the same time.
3244926	3247269	Was that the script that started at Milpitas Golf Land?
3247289	3252515	Because that was faker than Elizabeth Berkley's moves.
3252655	3253135	I tried...
3254597	3255438	Who wrote that again?
3256278	3259621	I'm pretty sure it was one of the South Bay folks, but I don't know.
3259801	3262423	I actually tried at the time to get the script for it.
3262763	3266787	However, the only way you can get... Was it... I think it was...
3268724	3275288	I'm sure it's somebody that's now banned from DDR Freak.
3275709	3277830	And for writing that piece of crap, you deserved it.
3277950	3278390	I'm just kidding.
3278490	3284994	I actually, I tried getting the script at the time when that was like the big news, you know, it was the stupid DDR Freak movie.
3285254	3285474	Right.
3285494	3295497	But the only problem was, the only way you could get a script of the movie is if you were a member of this casting group or whatever.
3295517	3299438	You know, I almost wanted to sign up for that just because I wanted to know.
3299718	3301499	I wanted to know how fake this shit was.
3301539	3303539	Someone posted the whole script on DDR Freak.
3303559	3305200	You could just go click the link and get it.
3305260	3305600	Really?
3306040	3307001	I thought it was fake, though.
3307061	3308021	It was in a thread.
3309161	3310502	The supposed script, it was on there.
3311222	3311622	Interesting.
3313260	3315161	Yeah, well, it was crap, and, yeah.
3316723	3322307	I would have liked to see it made, I mean, because I've, to be honest, I've seen worse made, and it's actually sold.
3322847	3327030	I think they could make a DDR movie, but not that group that was trying to do it.
3327110	3331634	I mean, you don't, what, what the fuck did you do, pay money to be in a movie?
3331674	3333035	Let me, let me go over a couple.
3333055	3337078	You have to pay money to audition, that's lame.
3337438	3340699	A couple actual movies that are out here.
3340799	3341860	Let's just see here.
3341940	3347202	Spectrum Entertainment, they're an awesome company that distributes just anything that they get their hands on.
3347322	3348242	And I mean anything.
3348762	3352263	Let's see, we've got Ankle Biters, the old midget vampire movie.
3353004	3353664	That one's great.
3353924	3356345	We have one that's called Night Chills.
3356425	3356805	It's about...
3357365	3376755	About, um, this guy that plays Dungeons and Dragons And then all of a sudden, like, people are getting killed that play Dungeons and Dragons By this guy that's dressed up like a giant knight in an armor suit thing It's crap And then there's another one called Envy Full title, Penis Envy It's about these two chicks that are wandering through the desert And just decide, you know what?
3376875	3379437	Our lives would be a lot better if we had penises So what happens?
3379617	3383799	This giant drag queen fairy Just, uh, the penis fairy goes
3384299	3385920	Oh, you all have penises now!
3386261	3397049	And it's like a couple hours of them just like doing shit with their penises and growing mustaches and it's just really nasty shit and at the very end of the movie they make a trip down to L.A.
3397089	3403974	to meet the penis fairy again and to get it removed and it ends in tragedy as like one of the girls gets shot and killed and
3404614	3405535	I just really didn't care.
3405735	3418040	There's no plot to the movie at all other than what would happen if two white trash hookers got penises and started running around screwing the white trash redneck locals there and yada yada yada yada.
3418361	3422222	And like for some reason no one notices that they're chicks with mustaches with giant dicks.
3422282	3425024	Did they have boobs too?
3425544	3426504	They had boobs and dicks?
3426544	3429146	Yeah, that would appear and disappear at will.
3429206	3429646	It's like...
3430478	3432359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3452366	3454887	I actually have a collection of the worst movies known to man.
3455307	3457888	I actually go out of my way to find these movies and buy them.
3458328	3466811	The next two movies that have been sent to me are Feeders 2, rated 1, the lowest rated movie ever watched on SomethingAwful.com.
3467471	3469012	So I'm getting that movie.
3469032	3471573	Don't forget Manos, The Hands of Fate.
3471793	3472333	Oh, God.
3472513	3473653	That movie is so bad.
3474013	3477495	It put me to sleep watching it on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.
3477575	3481316	It was so bad that Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch it.
3482581	3484142	It was awful.
3484722	3488104	And then there was also, what other ones did we get?
3488344	3490725	Of course, Wild Zero was pretty bad.
3491385	3492786	That Japanese rock and roll punk.
3493066	3498548	It was a punk rock zombie alien movie with some chick that was a guy.
3499809	3500529	Weird shit.
3501109	3501590	I don't know.
3503751	3505932	What other movies did I watch that were really crappy?
3507872	3508893	Let me see here.
3510427	3524238	We had one, he came from Planet K. I had one really funny part in it where the alien walked up to this guy who got shot, picked up his gun, shot him in the leg, healed his leg, shot him in his leg again, healed his leg, shot him in the leg again.
3524999	3526380	That was just hilarious at the time.
3528822	3529683	So now what's your plan?
3530063	3532925	How are we going to convince this company that they need to make a DDR movie?
3534154	3535255	You just made it to them.
3535335	3536096	They're all, it's done?
3536236	3536996	Okay, we'll take it.
3537016	3540099	Well, so are we going to have to have Jamie star in the movie and, like, grow a dick?
3542440	3542901	No.
3544322	3546303	Do we have to do some stunts like that?
3546323	3547424	Use Twin.
3548265	3551667	I think you need some, like, upskirt panty cam stuff going there.
3552788	3554650	Maybe a zombie just for kicks.
3555210	3556631	Maybe some topless chicks.
3556991	3558032	And an exploding toilet.
3558512	3560554	And people who can't act to save their life.
3561298	3562139	Oh, yeah.
3562219	3563459	Dude, so we should all star in it.
3563980	3568122	Dude, they should make DDR Freak the porno.
3570544	3576527	Dude, you could cast like a bunch of hot Japanese chicks just playing DDR and having sex on the pad.
3577027	3577928	DDR Freak?
3578088	3578388	No, no.
3578468	3583651	DDR Freak and hot Japanese people are not like two things that can be used in the same sense.
3583731	3583971	Fine.
3585352	3588633	Ah, DDR sex freaks or something like that.
3588653	3589113	There you go.
3589934	3597416	First of all, there's already hentai art done involving a dance pad that I've, like, seen one picture because someone posted it somewhere.
3598277	3602218	I have not had the urge to go look for it, but I know it exists.
3602658	3606059	Why does it seem like all of our conversations seem to stray back to porn?
3606079	3606560	That's alright.
3606860	3607320	Gets ratings.
3609080	3610281	I just don't know what it is.
3611281	3611941	Hansel Strange, 3-2-9-E.
3614215	3617218	But yeah, there was some really bad movies.
3617278	3622684	There was one that was like an American vampire, and that was with Carmen Electra.
3623265	3631273	And she was like some vampire, and then there was even, they actually had a part in this movie, a track that you can listen to, that was making fun of the movie.
3631313	3632014	It was so bad.
3633695	3637019	They had a track, an audio track, where people were making fun of the movie.
3638847	3640188	I was just like, okay.
3640709	3641289	Interesting.
3641369	3646233	Well, I think we need to make that our mission, is we need to make an actual DDR movie.
3647174	3648795	Orange Lounge, the motion picture.
3648995	3649456	How about it?
3650577	3651938	Let's break out the 8mm cam.
3653859	3654800	Jamie, take off your top.
3657862	3658363	No, Rob.
3658403	3660044	It's for artistic purposes.
3661265	3662366	No, Rob.
3664908	3665008	No.
3666926	3667526	I have yo-yo.
3668687	3672009	Man, if only I hadn't gotten rid of my hooker hook up there, man.
3672689	3675351	I could have, like... Wait, you knew a hooker or something?
3676912	3678132	Well, we can go into this story.
3678813	3679273	Oh, God.
3679293	3679593	All right.
3680053	3680354	Why not?
3680374	3681434	We got three hours to film now.
3681454	3681794	Okay.
3683095	3685356	This is a story of how I accidentally met a hooker.
3686337	3689919	And one can say, accidentally, how does one accidentally meet a hooker?
3690279	3692401	Well, it's quite interesting, actually.
3693021	3694762	And here's how it goes.
3695243	3700846	Okay, one day I decided, you know, I took a Friday off and I needed to get my hair cut because, you know, it kind of gets long sometimes.
3701147	3703548	So I got my hair cut and everything, and this is during the summer once.
3703588	3706290	You just got a haircut or you got them all cut?
3709112	3709853	Worst joke ever.
3709973	3710193	Anyway.
3710697	3711758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3726597	3739251	and, um, this, it looks like, I swear to God, she was, she couldn't have been that old, she, I thought it was a high school student, and looked like her little brother, so I, so they, so she's like, can we get a ride down the street to our apartment?
3739291	3740613	She was in high school, I swear!
3742108	3747832	I swear, well, that's what I thought it was, and they're like, it's kind of hot out here, can we get a ride down to our apartment?
3747852	3748632	I'm like, where do you guys live?
3748813	3750053	Oh, just Creekside.
3750093	3752135	I was like, oh, okay, because there's a couple blocks down the street.
3752555	3759740	So that was fine, so they got in the car, and so I couldn't quite make the left to go to Creekside, which was two blocks, so I had to go around the block.
3760320	3772992	So, you know, we go around the block and stuff, and her kid, you know, who I found out was her son, you know, was playing around in the backseat because I had a bunch of anime movies back there and stuff, and she was talking to me, and she kept hitting on me.
3773613	3775615	She's all, she's all, so, what are you doing later?
3776616	3778037	Do you want, do you want to go out tonight?
3778878	3779578	Stuff like that.
3779599	3779999	Hey, baby.
3780559	3781040	Stuff like that.
3781060	3784103	And I was like, I'm all, now I got a girlfriend, you know, I, I'm,
3784663	3791526	I'm actually, you know, we're going out later and stuff, so I took her back to her place, and she's all, she's all, can I give you gas money?
3791546	3793687	Yeah, Loki has a girlfriend that hates DDR.
3798309	3799649	Yeah, I'm just messing with you.
3800610	3803191	Oh no, no, she'll play DDR, just when I'm not there.
3804331	3808753	She played it like once in Tahoe, and, well anyways, back to the story, with the hooker.
3809213	3810334	So, so she...
3811972	3815394	I take her back to her apartment and she's like, here, let me give you gas money.
3815514	3816974	I'm like, no, that's fine.
3817454	3819015	Wait, so a hooker was going to pay you?
3819835	3822896	She was going to pay me for gas money to give her a ride to her house.
3822976	3824237	Oh, right, gas money.
3824497	3825417	Gas money, yes.
3826137	3834360	I refused the gas money because it was only... I refused the gas money because it was only... You were being a good Samaritan.
3834380	3835401	I was being a good Samaritan.
3835441	3839002	It was only a few blocks and it was like... You were helping your fellow hooker.
3839022	3839182	I was...
3839662	3841083	I didn't know she was a hooker, okay?
3841503	3844505	We haven't gotten to the part where I figured out she was a hooker.
3844525	3847527	Right now I thought she was some... Now she was?
3847968	3849589	SoCalKick says she needed to fill up.
3851010	3854092	Hey, she was... Okay, she was pretty hot, okay?
3854412	3863378	And she was... I thought she was just some really desperate single mom who wanted some action or some shit like that.
3863718	3865119	Who happened to look like she was in high school.
3866036	3875459	At the time, yeah, she looked pretty young, so, I mean, I placed her anywhere from, like, 17 to 20, low 20 range, so, I'm not good with age.
3875679	3879900	Shit, man, now with age, I mean, fucking 12-year-olds look like 16-year-olds, so what am I supposed to judge?
3879940	3880960	Anyway, how'd you find out she was younger?
3881000	3886101	Okay, so, I refused my answer, she's like, here, you want a soda?
3886722	3891043	So, I was like, okay, so, I went into her apartment, probably mistake number one here.
3891163	3891543	Whoops!
3893942	3896803	Yeah, oh, you were forced in at gunpoint into her apartment.
3897043	3897883	I was not forced!
3898003	3900763	I wanted that damn soda, okay?
3900883	3902864	Oh, you wanted to taste the sweet juice, yes.
3906185	3922908	So, went to her apartment, phone rang right when we got in there, so... Actually, it was kind of weird because I didn't quite realize it at first, but she had told her son to go play because mommy was working or something like that, and I was like, huh?
3922928	3922968	So...
3923608	3941858	Anyway, so we went to the apartment, I got, no, I got the soda, and she was, you know, the phone rang, so I just sat down drinking soda, and then, like, midway out of, like, fucking nowhere, because I guess it was her mom on the phone, she just, like, puts her hand over the phone, walks up to me, and she's like, do you want a blowjob?
3941878	3942138	I'm like...
3943380	3944762	Uh, no.
3946244	3947286	What kind of man are you?
3949269	3952714	You know, I should have, but I said no, that's morally wrong.
3952734	3956540	You should have said, yes, I want a blowjob, but not from you, you skanky whore.
3957102	3958903	So anyways, so I said no.
3958983	3959863	She got off the phone.
3959923	3962725	She kind of explained to me how she was working.
3963085	3965546	She thought I was like afraid that she was a cop or something.
3965566	3969268	So she, you know, pulls down her shirt to show me her tits and says, you know.
3969308	3971049	Oh, that would have gone nice.
3971089	3971689	Yeah.
3972529	3974130	So there was some gratification in that.
3974150	3974430	Oh, yeah.
3974891	3975511	Got a nice brush.
3975531	3976151	A reward.
3976571	3977592	A reward, I guess.
3977692	3981534	But no, she was just trying to prove to me that she wasn't wired or some shit like that.
3981634	3981714	And
3982134	3990636	So I was like, uh, no, that's really alright, no, so, and this is where I probably should have just said, fuck it, I'm leaving, yeah, just get me the hell out of here.
3990656	3993997	But you got to see some titties, so now you were kind of wondering what's going to happen next.
3995158	4003580	Yes, but, okay, so now, so I was just like, okay, no, I can't do that, so, so she's like, okay, well, can I ask you another favor?
4003600	4004880	I'm like, alright, what?
4004900	4007101	She's like, I need a ride down to Ranja, so I was like...
4007561	4012366	Okay, fine, because that's on my way home, so I was going to give her a ride down to Rancho for some reason.
4012386	4021635	Okay, so we go down 50, and during the way she's, you know, talking to me and shit, and she's like, you know, still trying to push the hole, she wants to give me a blowjob thing.
4021655	4022155	Okay.
4023016	4028642	I mean, Ray, after refusing so many times, you'd think I'd say yes, but just for some reason, I still said no.
4029263	4037472	And so, she started explaining the whole basic business structure of prostitution, which is quite interesting, actually.
4038894	4040255	Was she talking about her boss?
4041116	4042317	No, actually, she was the pimp.
4046525	4047946	It's quite weird.
4048026	4050587	It was a really strange infrastructure she's got going there.
4050727	4055088	She basically finds, you know, it's really easy to become pink.
4055108	4058329	You just gotta basically find women there walking around.
4058369	4061131	They'll know where they're going or what.
4061211	4062531	They'll look lost and stuff.
4062551	4064352	You just say you'll take care of them.
4065352	4067193	They can make lots of money and that kind of shit.
4067933	4070434	Right now I was kind of tuning around listening to the radio.
4070854	4075336	Then she started talking about how she had a bunch of apartments in different places and stuff like that.
4077096	4081558	I took her to Rancho and she saw some other hooker walking around.
4081678	4083598	A hooker buddy.
4083818	4088180	She wanted me to come get this hooker to be my hooker.
4088260	4089660	I'd be the pimp for this hooker.
4089680	4092001	I'm like, no, that's alright.
4092161	4092521	I'm all...
4093281	4097662	I'm all, I'm all, I gotta, and then she wanted to give me her pager number, so in case I had any friends.
4097962	4101363	Now, I, I thought about... Like, refer a friend to the wonderful world of whoredom.
4101383	4102764	Oh, exactly, and I get a cut off the top, you know?
4102924	4108045	I was like, I was like, maybe not, you know, that, no.
4108405	4112447	So then she got on my car finally, and that's why I sped off and went back home.
4113867	4116268	Okay, now, the question about all this.
4116688	4118628	How the fuck does this have anything to do with Bomani?
4119769	4120069	Okay.
4122626	4124627	Did we actually talk about Imani all day?
4124667	4129210	Oh shit, we're almost halfway through the show and we haven't talked about Imani.
4131011	4132012	Oh boy, okay.
4132352	4137915	Well, anything else to add to your little wonderful wide world of whoredom story there?
4138115	4140917	She also thought that I didn't want to blowjob her because she was black.

4324888	4330089	I will troll the back of you, come on, come on, I'll dream some too, I want you to
4469531	4470332	Thanks for watching!
4537666	4538848	Thanks for watching!
4669628	4673792	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
4674032	4675734	Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
4675794	4676154	No!
4676255	4679878	Do we care what people think of us?
4680539	4682401	No!
4682421	4683822	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
4684302	4687145	Yes!
4688406	4693171	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
4694429	4699790	You're listening to Porringe Lounge Radio, as somebody in the chat room referred to it earlier.
4700530	4701630	It's porntastic.
4701710	4702690	It's fat-tastic.
4704611	4706111	Makes my mouth water.
4708111	4710972	Where we don't talk about Pomani ever on this program.
4711012	4712152	That's just a side show.
4712712	4713632	To DDR.
4714493	4715393	Ha ha ha.
4715593	4716173	Not here.
4716473	4716633	Yeah.
4717253	4722154	Anyway, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I know is Jamie's favorite segment, right?
4722174	4722254	Yeah.
4723621	4723961	Teehee.
4724682	4726044	Is this your favorite part of the show?
4726164	4726364	Yes?
4726684	4727045	One of them.
4727305	4727605	One of them.
4728286	4729087	I like the whole thing.
4730789	4738176	This is the FU of the week where Jamie just goes off on something that pisses her off and then we all play along.
4738216	4739498	We all talk about things that piss us off.
4739538	4740419	So, without further ado...
4741877	4743998	Jamie, what the hell is pissing you off this time?
4744019	4747281	First thing that pisses me off is the fact that I've been using the same version of Schlagwerk.
4747561	4750423	So I think in the future when we should use the, quote, terror mix.
4750823	4754846	Well then, get me an MP3 of the terror mix and we'll do the terror mix.
4755266	4755827	Easily done.
4756767	4760090	But now my real one goes toward the events that happened early this morning.
4760930	4763392	I was over here watching Showgirls.
4764801	4766281	You are a whore, darling.
4766842	4769102	Anyway, we were over here watching Showgirls.
4769482	4771643	We went live on the show, which was fun and random.
4771783	4777545	Yes, which we do occasionally, which is more incentive to listen to our Bomani Music Amore program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station.
4777565	4778565	We're in the show out.
4779705	4781566	Anyway, I get home.
4782146	4786427	I knew Dan was going to be having people over for that piece of shit Xbox Live crap.
4788180	4791662	I go in there and there's like everybody and God in my living room.
4791903	4792983	God was in your living room?
4793324	4794244	Well, no.
4794484	4794945	Amazing.
4794985	4796926	Because if God were there, he wouldn't be playing the Xbox.
4798607	4799067	Anyway.
4799167	4800588	He'd be too busy smiting people.
4800909	4803851	He'd be playing Animal Crossing, where everybody can be a god.
4804751	4807573	Anyway, I go, and there's just all these fucking people there.
4807593	4808454	And I'm exhausted.
4808834	4813917	So we go upstairs, we play some 2DX, and then Bailey will walk in and...
4815069	4815349	Ryan.
4815949	4816389	Black Lab.
4816569	4817230	I was tired.
4817350	4818410	Rise from your grave.
4818490	4819710	I was very hyper.
4820111	4821851	Did you see all that candy you ate?
4821871	4822991	No, it was actually caffeine.
4823011	4823111	What?
4823152	4825532	Anyway, this is my fuck you, so leave your candy out of it.
4825552	4825732	Anyway.
4825792	4826352	I go downstairs.
4844764	4848207	and say, okay, please guys, one last game.
4848807	4850168	Dan goes, no!
4851729	4852950	You knew we were going to be here.
4857134	4858815	How inconsiderate, you know?
4859475	4861657	I come home, and I'm tired.
4862358	4863438	Was it his time of the month?
4863799	4865000	Yeah, it must have been.
4866421	4870724	We had the Oriental Boa.
4870824	4871245	Anyway.
4872666	4873006	Anyway.
4874691	4878733	I know, it's one thing, I admit I came home late, and that's one thing.
4879393	4882835	I would have thought that they would have wrapped it up by then, or would have just wrapped it up.
4882855	4888998	You came home late out of consideration for the party, because you didn't want to see no stinking Xboxes, because they're just giant paperweights.
4889018	4898403	Instead I come home, and there's five TVs in my living room, and three Xboxes hooked up, and they're playing some stupid mecha ball game.
4899574	4900175	Mecha Balls?
4900555	4905142	No, like, you go to, like, the one, like, Capture the Five, you have a ball, and you have to kick the ball across.
4905162	4905963	It's really stupid.
4907409	4909069	They were playing with balls all night, basically.
4909109	4910210	And it was fucking loud.
4910390	4912410	You had a bunch of men in your living room playing with balls.
4912610	4912890	Yes.
4913991	4914731	Just checking.
4915751	4920652	So, I go upstairs and decide to make my icons, and I made, like, two Draco Malfoy ones.
4920752	4922273	I was like, this sucks.
4923093	4929515	So, this is what, you know, I thought that maybe he was going to be considerate and, you know, have everybody go home.
4930195	4931235	And then this is what I hear.
4931855	4933396	Okay, one more game.
4934676	4934936	Fuck!
4936027	4937348	I'm upstairs going, go home!
4937788	4938309	You heard me!
4938809	4942913	I was like, it's just, go home, get out of my house, I want to go to bed.
4943653	4948157	I would not have been able to go to bed with all of that bullshit going on.
4949258	4950459	And I was fucking tired.
4951079	4953761	Okay, I had been up all for a while.
4953801	4955122	You need to have your revenge.
4955963	4956904	You need to have people over.
4956944	4958625	You need to have people over for a gem marathon.
4958665	4958805	Yes.
4966380	4968601	No, I'll just have another good money party at the apartment.
4969101	4970182	How's that?
4971562	4974663	The last one we had, we had, what, 20 people showed up?
4974723	4975404	Yeah.
4975484	4976424	In my living room!
4979265	4985968	Which, you know, the living room, you know, it's probably, it's a two-bedroom, no, you only have really a one, no, you have a two-bedroom apartment.
4985988	4987909	I have a two-bedroom, but it's a two-story apartment.
4988689	4989930	Sort of like a townhouse, but not quite.
4989950	4995992	But anyway, you know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but it really pissed me off.
4996781	4998943	And he's like mad at me for being mad at him.
4998983	5000384	I'm like, huh?
5001865	5002845	Excuse me?
5002885	5006828	You know, I've gotten it out of my system now.
5006908	5010371	I want the whole world to know my displeasure.
5010891	5013193	I want all the Xbox balls to die.
5013213	5017115	A big thank you to Xbox for ruining Jamie's life.
5017335	5019137	Yeah, fuck you, Gates.
5019949	5020870	I hope you die.
5021590	5036181	May your brakes fail on the freeway and you go off of a cliff and land in a gigantic tank of sulfuric acid and dissolve slowly for hours until you finally die.
5036281	5040464	And then I hope your soul doesn't go to hell or doesn't go to heaven.
5040504	5042806	I hope you're stuck in purgatory where you're bored forever.
5044369	5045590	My, are you done ranting?
5046170	5046570	Are you finished?
5046690	5047411	I don't think so.
5047571	5048491	Excuse me, world!
5049091	5050932	This is my segment, hello.
5051553	5054674	You know, all of your little input is just, you know, consequence.
5054694	5055995	This is my segment.
5056035	5060457	Funny, you just had to, like, reset the little, uh, FU song, like, three times by now.
5060477	5061598	So you can keep ranting.
5061658	5063279	I'm the ranty bitch of the show, I'm allowed.
5063299	5064619	That's right, that's my role on the program.
5064979	5066220	Music bitch.
5066240	5066580	Fuck.
5066660	5070082	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
5070662	5072703	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
5073063	5073704	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
5075976	5080179	This is just... Okay, I'm being seemed about it.
5080639	5082601	I've made several noises of displeasure.
5082721	5088565	Okay, breathe in, breathe out, do some yoga, drink some boba, feel better.
5089165	5090646	I get boba tonight.
5091587	5092848	This is a good fucking night.
5093328	5094048	Anyway, next!
5094409	5096470	Alright, moving along.
5097191	5097711	Loki!
5100673	5103295	Alright, how can you possibly follow up that porn story?
5103315	5103395	Okay.
5105357	5105477	Oh!
5107398	5108778	Let's see.
5109339	5113800	Well, I have to give a big FU to my cold, which is now gone, thank God.
5114141	5118502	But it lasted too long, and it was annoying, so thank God it's gone.
5119263	5127626	A big FU to the putters at Golf Land, because they keep chipping my shots.
5127786	5130147	Every time I hit the ball, it goes flying up in the air.
5131315	5134497	I have to add to that because they're like made crooked.
5135357	5136318	I swear to God they are.
5136358	5141541	I mean, I've looked at all of them when I worked there and if you actually hold the putter up and look at it, the faces are crooked.
5141901	5143242	You can't punch straight with those things.
5143262	5145103	They're made to fuck with you like that.
5145844	5148945	Yeah, see, they make the putters just like they make all of the clubs.
5148965	5152647	See, they go straight and then they turn so you can hit the ball.
5153748	5156290	But I think that you meant the shafts are crooked.
5156990	5158251	No one likes a crooked shaft.
5160990	5161811	Like, how's it hanging?
5162491	5163732	A little bent right now.
5163912	5164293	Crooked.
5165153	5166374	Small shrivels and two left.
5166454	5169237	That's actually a real, like, disorder.
5169317	5173000	And a crooked shaft.
5173060	5175582	Anyways, um, another FD goes to, uh...
5179327	5180308	Can I finish?
5180568	5181349	Can I finish?
5181609	5182069	Thank you!
5182509	5183330	No, play my music!
5184571	5194477	Now, um, another FU goes to Folsom Lake Bowl for being one of the most ghetto bowling alley, actually it's the only bowling alley in Folsom, but it's very ghetto.
5194937	5196458	In fact they have these things that are called
5197178	5197878	Little Homies.
5198458	5201499	So I bought one, it's a stupid little thing that comes in a bottle.
5201519	5203240	Oh, dude, the Homies dolls, I know what you're talking about.
5203260	5203900	They're cool.
5204360	5215023	So, I took one of those, and I took it to Golfland, and I wanted the homie to go down the rapids, because, you know, that's what the homie's gonna do when the ball is go down the fucking rapids.
5215363	5222185	So I threw him up in the fountain, and the fucking homie got stuck in the middle of the fountain, and the goddamn thing couldn't get it back, and my homie's gone!
5223038	5227269	So anyways, NFB to the fountain that stole my homie And uh, let's see
5233129	5243777	And on top of that, that would be the price for making me spend $200 there for putting stuff very cheap in a... They had 40-speed CD burners for $19 there.
5244258	5245158	How awesome is that?
5245178	5246740	I mean... It's a good brand.
5246840	5247200	Yeah.
5247640	5248481	Oh, verbatim.
5248541	5249802	It was pretty decent.
5250142	5253185	But I ended up buying a $129 one because of Yamaha.
5253265	5257588	And it burns these really cool disc tattoo things that you can't see on normal discs.
5258229	5261071	They tell you that in the manual, not on the outside of the box.
5261676	5262437	That kind of sucks.
5263137	5266280	Um, FD to me for buying two Saturns and Chords for one.
5266320	5273205	Because I bought one from Denios from this chick that couldn't speak English, but it was $10, so I was like, okay.
5273565	5279690	And then this other one was like $75 and came with games and Chords and shit, so I bought that and it was awesome.
5280190	5284173	But yeah, FD to that stupid chick who couldn't speak English because she's learning to speak English.
5284213	5286435	She lives in the freaking United States!
5286535	5287615	Speak English, dammit!
5288874	5290235	We don't speak Italian here!
5290715	5291095	English!
5292036	5295038	So... So yeah.
5295658	5302302	Aside from that, FD to my mom for making me listen to this stupid, like, spa music tape on the way down to Denial's.
5303402	5311687	Okay, this guy, he took a cover... I mean, he was covering, like, Fur Elise in, um... He called it Imagine, but I don't think he said it.
5311727	5313548	Yeah, it was so important.
5313588	5314529	It was so masculine.
5317878	5320967	I have some really weak FUs this week.
5321248	5323214	FU for me not being a good FU.
5323993	5324854	Yeah, fuck you.
5324874	5325654	Play my music.
5326575	5330999	Oh, and F you to my fucking co-worker of mine, Linda.
5332360	5340666	Freaking keeps telling me to get back to work and stop browsing the internet when I have the highest phone time out of the company.
5340966	5346270	I took like 400 calls in one day and shit, which is pretty huge.
5346371	5350013	And she just has the nerve to start bitching at me about being on the phone.
5350033	5353096	Then she goes back and starts talking with the other girl who's not on the phone.
5353516	5359140	Talking about, like, her boyfriend or some guy that she thought was cute and had a nice ass and all that shit.
5359160	5360221	So, yeah, after her and that's it.
5360241	5360401	I'm done.
5360421	5361702	That was fucked up.
5361722	5361922	Next.
5361982	5365265	I have a couple FUs this week, believe it or not.
5378945	5379485	No!
5379786	5387811	Um, my first F you goes to, um, anybody I've ever gone out clubbing with before, because I've always had to drive in the past.
5387851	5392354	But this week, I got to be a participant in the drinking festivities when I went out to the bar.
5392895	5399760	I got so drunk off my ass, I had to be carried out of the bar, and I had so much fun, that I've just been missing out all these years.
5399860	5403062	So, um, F people who always make me be the designated driver.
5403803	5406384	Um, a big F you to Politary, I hate you.
5407365	5408286	Um, yes.
5408926	5411127	Everybody knows your collar is covered.
5411307	5412908	They're probably trying to do you a favor.
5413909	5414949	F you, lady.
5415870	5416090	No.
5416110	5416870	Step on your foot.
5418091	5418251	Ow.
5420312	5422273	Watch out or I'll kick your face in.
5422653	5428116	Like, what's your face in there?
5429296	5432498	A big F you to my 2DX controller.
5432718	5434058	You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
5434158	5434899	I second that.
5436829	5438630	A big F you to the song DXY.
5438890	5440191	You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
5440811	5441832	No, it's tack!
5443573	5445914	And a big F you to Colors for the same reason.
5446335	5447475	You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
5449116	5453299	F you to whoever called me during the show.
5453339	5454039	That was embarrassing.
5456601	5460283	F you to anyone that doesn't live in Sacramento because you live in a better place, I'm sure.
5461964	5462744	No, except for Davis.
5462764	5463305	Davis sucks.
5463605	5464405	And Chico sucks too.
5464425	5465346	That's Republican Davis.
5466744	5468404	Gwen lives in Naples, Florida.
5470385	5471485	You're right, I'm sorry.
5472945	5475285	And Florida is also exempt from that because you have twins.
5475305	5482947	They also messed up the... They still messed up the fucking ballot counts down there in Florida for like the governor race.
5483727	5486807	Dude, that's a dump of fucking chads!
5487288	5488508	What's a chad?
5488528	5491088	What's a poop in a freaking home for?
5491988	5493669	I swear to God, they're so stupid.
5494509	5495349	Yeah, they're stupid.
5496448	5498170	Stupid old people that live in Florida.
5498930	5499431	Old people suck.
5499491	5501032	That'd be the old people.
5501052	5502153	Why don't you die?
5502294	5503315	No one wants you around.
5503375	5504676	That's why they're sending you to Florida.
5504756	5505677	Just go die.
5506157	5506678	Die.
5506958	5507759	No one misses you.
5507979	5508359	Die.
5508499	5510021	They'll make room for more resorts.
5511382	5512984	Florida is like the gateway to hell.
5513004	5515626	It's like where they keep all the old people and wait to die.
5516047	5517468	Actually, hell is really close to there.
5517648	5518909	It's a small little island.
5518929	5521732	But yeah, it's crazy hot and humid every day.
5522483	5529668	Oh, and F you to Spazzy, who's in the chat room right now, because he got to go see Hot People last night, and I didn't, and I'm jealous.
5529848	5530368	So F you.
5531128	5531449	Okay.
5531769	5533150	Is it my turn now?
5533830	5535071	Yes, it's your turn, Dave.
5537532	5538553	No, I get it.
5538593	5539133	My song.
5540094	5541075	My song's gay.
5541755	5542155	Literally.
5543296	5543576	Okay.
5544377	5548279	I don't really have that many F yous, but many of them are like Rob's.
5549013	5552555	Okay, first, F you to my parents for not wanting to take me out here.
5553595	5558077	I have to, uh, I actually have to stop that for a minute because I have to thank Dave's parents for the taquitos.
5558897	5559417	Oh, okay.
5560638	5561038	That's all.
5561358	5561959	Tacos!
5562039	5562779	The taquitos.
5563719	5563999	Okay.
5564019	5566320	That was horrible.
5566400	5566861	Die.
5568661	5569982	The taquitos.
5570022	5570222	Yes.
5571042	5571343	Okay.
5571823	5572163	Anyway.
5572659	5578924	Fuck them for not wanting to take me out here and for making me read 100 pages of a shitty-ass book today so I could cum.
5579244	5582147	Because a yellow raft in blue water is crap.
5583047	5583908	I hate reading.
5584709	5595658	And then, also I fuck you's to many 2DX songs which I can't pass, such as StarMind for the fucking last ten, like, two seconds of it.
5596078	5602123	Because it has, like, 20 notes at once, and I always get down to 58% or whatever it is when you miss all of them.
5602763	5603443	So fuck that.
5604623	5606844	And fuck all the seven stars that I can't pass.
5607404	5607884	Okay.
5608764	5609344	I think that's it.
5609524	5609864	That's it.
5610044	5610785	It's Raining Men.
5611265	5611925	Fuck this song.
5612105	5612605	Oh wait, no.
5612765	5614905	And fuck Twen because he said that he wanted to be fucked.
5616486	5618286	No, he said that he wanted to be... Whatever makes you happy.
5618386	5620186	He said that he wanted to be everyone's fuck you.
5620446	5621667	So.
5622347	5626748	And now we're... And now we're gonna go to Black Labs FUs.
5627008	5628428	And this song is meant to be ironic.
5631357	5632038	It's the cat song.
5633039	5633399	Yay.
5633519	5637604	Okay, first, fuck this song.
5638225	5639646	Because it's about cats.
5641148	5643731	I would have rather heard Who Let the Dogs Out than this.
5644291	5645813	I can erase that, don't tempt me.
5645833	5646574	Okay, like it.
5648015	5648215	No.
5649817	5650478	Okay, let's see.
5650498	5651179	First of all...
5652242	5654503	I didn't get to do my FUs of last week, so fuck that.
5654843	5656363	Because I was not around.
5657023	5659604	I was at home most of the weekend.
5659744	5663185	Oh, you had a birthday or something that you think is more important.
5663765	5664765	Oh, shut up, Rob.
5665405	5672767	Yeah, well, it happened to be my 18th birthday, which was actually this past Wednesday, but I went home the weekend before, which made me mishap.
5673747	5676608	And I went paintballing, which was cool, but we got rained out.
5677884	5687090	I found out that he found my live journal and read through every single entry.
5709465	5712527	And that kind of pissed me off, really.
5715708	5716809	It's on the internet.
5717510	5719090	It's not private.
5719371	5722252	No, but the fact is that... But there's more to it.
5723293	5730397	Yeah, see, it's kind of a longer story here, but what he did was he actually first...
5731247	5759435	saw it on my computer and then went and snooped through it then he gave it the addresses to the rest of the people in the suite that I live in and they all read it and now they're they get all they're like all freaked out now and then they're they actually one of them actually told me that they thought they kind of had the consensus that I was going to go snap and fucking kill them because of all the ranting I do in my live journal so say yes ha ha
5763381	5769545	The fact that they actually went through and started using it against me really irked me.
5769906	5780072	And then my roommate actually went and decided to instant message a couple of my friends from my friends list asking about the stuff in there.
5780173	5783495	And it was like, okay, that's just getting a bit too fucking nosy.
5784636	5786777	And that really pissed me off.
5787117	5790459	I think that's the first time anyone's ever said irk on this show.
5791880	5792681	I beg to differ.
5792721	5794262	I believe I would have said that word in the past.
5794282	5794622	Come on.
5795223	5795703	I like that word.
5795783	5796023	Ert.
5796484	5797044	Like Erkel.
5798245	5799246	I think Irina said it before.
5799826	5800947	I will have to check the archives.
5801448	5802809	Anyway, Black Lapis is continuing.
5802829	5802969	Yes.
5803009	5806491	I'm going to continue.
5806551	5807152	Let's see.
5808072	5814958	Fuck the dining halls at Davis because they serve the same food over and over again and I'm sick of it already.
5815798	5820362	And next time I eat there, I swear I'm going to puke all over the table there.
5822637	5822877	What?
5823217	5823798	No, let him finish.
5824058	5825198	Let me finish, damn it!
5825298	5827459	I'm just... I'm just... You didn't let him move.
5828439	5828680	No.
5829260	5832221	Let Twen move.
5833582	5833942	Okay.
5834142	5836103	Let's see.
5836403	5841445	Fuck the rain for messing up this wheel on my bike so that now my brakes don't work.
5842345	5843486	I have to get those fixed now.
5844186	5844866	And, uh, let's see.
5844886	5845166	Yeah.
5845246	5845927	Yeah.
5850566	5852887	Oh yeah, uh, yeah, this one's kinda recent here.
5853407	5855247	Fuck Rob for getting me addicted to 2DX.
5856107	5857347	You're welcome.
5857567	5865609	I spent, like, when I came over here last night and, like, let's see, we got here sometime, like, what was it, like, 8 o'clock or something?
5865629	5866309	Yeah, about then.
5866889	5874171	And then, I started playing 2DX, and I was like, okay, this is cool, and the next thing I know, I'm still playing, and it's 9 o'clock in the morning!
5875842	5882707	I played for probably 10 or 11 straight hours before I decided, oh shit, I think I need to get some sleep.
5883288	5886170	So I slept for two hours, and then went and played some more.
5888272	5890173	And I still want to go back and play more now.
5891474	5894436	And now I have to go home and have 2DX and I'm going to cry.
5895337	5895837	I'm done.
5897038	5899320	Alright, this song needs to be in DDR extreme.
5900161	5900741	Maybe it will be.
5901282	5904204	Any other FUs in the room before I get... Alright, Dave has another one.
5904704	5905505	Alright, Dave, yes.
5906243	5906604	Wait.
5907246	5907707	Oh shit.
5908529	5908990	I had it!
5909812	5910133	Fuck.
5911056	5911336	Wait.
5911838	5912860	Loki, Loki has it.
5917348	5937793	Okay, real quick, FU2, Old Navy, that place is Satan, it's just, it's evil, I hate the commercials, I hate the old stars that get on there for the stupid commercials, I wish they'd all go to hell, and then the whole place, when you walk in there, it's just like one big giant Old Navy commercial, it's like...
5938433	5939774	It's like so annoying!
5940034	5940574	I hate them!
5940914	5945637	And the only reason I went through to buy clothes was because I had a fucking gift certificate for $50.
5946017	5950240	So I thought I spent all the money on the gift certificate, because I was trying to get out of there as quick as possible.
5950620	5951160	Then I got there.
5951180	5952701	Oh, you have $6 left in your card!
5953001	5953501	DAMMIT!
5954302	5955603	NOOOOOO!
5956243	5957744	And I had to go back there and shop more.
5961406	5964248	No matter what, they're just gonna keep me there!
5964928	5965628	No!
5966189	5966709	Anyways, that's it.
5970427	5971747	Alright, it's chat room time.
5971868	5974929	Let's go to the chat room FUs.
5974989	5976089	Here we go.
5976129	5978130	I'm going to run through these as fast as I can.
5995106	5997347	This is the longest FUs I've ever, but that's alright.
5998267	6003009	JB says, um, F you to Winamp because it skips too much.
6005209	6017153	And DSCS says, um, F me, Sky, for making him work, fuck being sick for almost two weeks, fuck the doctors for scaring him about possibly having tuberculosis, and fuck homework.
6017934	6018854	Typical T-Gangs right there.
6018874	6019854	Why don't you go to the doctors?
6020195	6021995	What you don't know won't kill you.
6022595	6023676	I... No.
6025416	6030979	Twenz says, uh, fuck you to lesbians, fuck you to chicks without dicks, fuck you to chicks without tits.
6032320	6037163	Hey, hey, hey, okay, no titted chicks need lovin' too, okay?
6041145	6043366	He said, F you to chicks without dicks.
6046968	6052271	Anywho, uh, fuck you to Loki for not giving him the patron number to that hooker.
6053413	6056074	I don't have the pager number, so how can I give it to you?
6057535	6061857	Fuck you to still having his fucking cold, and fuck you to Macintoshes.
6063057	6068740	And, Twin, stop saying that, because I'll, like, hack your ass with my Mac, okay?
6069400	6070921	Mac's rule, bitch!
6071681	6072721	Let me talk about the Mac.
6073201	6073682	Let me see.
6074222	6077002	My toaster has more processing power than a fucking Mac.
6077022	6077863	Anyway, moving on.
6078223	6079243	More chatroom FUs.
6080543	6082184	EOSFBB.

6085284	6085865	YASVB.
6086085	6087245	I'm just going to call him YASVB.
6088125	6090806	YASVB says, many fuck yous go out to Cox Cable.

6113874	6120799	Fuck you to Dave for not beating the Ancient Boy game and fuck you to VidPower for not letting me plug his restaurant.
6121239	6122400	Dude, that game is a bitch.
6123061	6135470	I played for maybe half an hour straight and I could get down to one little fucking egg with two cracks in it and I couldn't beat it and it just bounced around and I hit it like 30 times back and forth and it never hit it.
6135890	6137191	It was such shit.
6137511	6141054	And then I was about to hit it and then a pop-up window came and I lost.
6141534	6142415	It's like, fuck!
6142935	6145777	By the way, I'm being told it's Yoastbub.
6147258	6147838	Yoastbub?
6147858	6148519	Yoastbub.
6149600	6151201	Yeah, Yoastbub, it wasn't my fault.
6151441	6152582	Go Yoastbub yourself.
6152762	6153022	Anyway.
6154383	6156164	Andrew says, what are the FUs for?
6157505	6159507	I have a private message, what are the FUs for?
6161168	6162709	Hopefully you're getting the hit by this point.
6166024	6190231	DCB says, no FU, he just wants to plug his tournament Fremont 2, January 11th, 2003 at Funtime Pizza He wants special FU music, but I didn't give it to him because I'm lazy Skyline DC505 says, FU to HISP for not letting me get sleep and sucking at Shaft and getting me sick this weekend, thanks
6193280	6196422	Dark Tetsuya says, fuck you to mom's work, that's why I miss chef.
6198743	6202625	Vid Pawa says, I don't have an FU of the week, but rather a thank you of the week.
6203125	6204706	Oh, he has a thank you of the week, how nice.
6205780	6210565	My thank you of the week goes to Cube Club, which is a public event sponsored by Nintendo and Panasonic.
6210886	6213248	Basically, I played GameCube games and got free shit.
6213629	6218434	Plus, I got a Nintendo wristband for beating total strangers at Mario Party 4, so thank you to the Cube Club.
6219535	6220596	Aww, wasn't that special.
6220757	6223680	I'm going to that Cube Club thing in, like, two weeks.
6225061	6225682	I got tickets.
6226022	6226902	Where's the Cube Club at?
6226962	6227823	I wanna go to the Cube Club.
6228183	6229384	They're doing it in San Francisco.
6229824	6232166	Are they doing it in Sacramento, I wonder?
6232246	6234047	I don't know if they're doing it in Sacramento.
6234067	6234788	I wanna go to the Cube Club!
6235208	6237089	They're doing it in San Francisco on Thanksgiving weekend.
6237149	6237790	I'm going!
6238110	6238490	Yeah!
6238950	6240972	I'm gonna whoop some ass at Mario Party.
6240992	6242233	Get myself some free shit.
6242773	6250518	See, what I'd do if I went to that thing is if someone started beating me at Mario Party and just started kicking the ass of the person next to me, I'd be like, you don't wanna do that.
6250538	6251459	Fucker!
6253257	6256841	Vandalist says fuck you to Pac Bell for not installing DSL in his area.
6256901	6257781	Dial-up sucks.
6258162	6258802	Prowny face.
6260744	6264168	Jomama says fuck you to Toys R Us for being out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
6265229	6267751	For Vandalist, try winfirst.com.
6268492	6274878	By the way, Yu-Gi-Oh, can you play my music real quick?
6275799	6277801	Fuck Yu-Gi-Oh because, okay, get this.
6280115	6289701	I, now this is just picky for me because being a Japanese major, I go into the Kadan store to hang out sometimes because my dad manages a game shop in Rancho Cordova.
6290221	6292142	People go, do you have any of those Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
6292743	6294184	Oh, you only have the Chinese ones.
6294644	6295965	Fuck you, they're Japanese.
6296225	6296805	Can't you see?
6297306	6297906	There's a difference.
6297946	6298646	They look different.
6299087	6299667	Stupid people.
6300047	6301068	Anyway, but no.
6302006	6302667	This whole Yu-Gi-Oh!
6302687	6303668	craze is retarded.
6304208	6306370	Okay, get this.
6307051	6309413	I have a comic book.
6310333	6313036	This is how comics come in Japan when they're new.
6313076	6315838	They come in a bound volume of different comics in one volume.
6316339	6317380	Well, I have a Yu-Gi-Oh!
6317460	6317900	one from 1991, okay?
6317920	6318280	It's old.
6322421	6323001	Get over it!
6323341	6326522	It's a show about playing a card game!
6326663	6327463	It's fucking old!
6327503	6328103	Yay!
6328163	6331444	Then again, there's also Hikaru no Go, which is about playing Go.
6331784	6333265	The cards come to life!
6333405	6338867	No, but I think that the anime is like Pokemon except with cards.
6339685	6341166	Yeah, and more strategy.
6341587	6343989	Which means it's just as lame as Pokemon.
6344129	6347111	Yeah, but like the cards cost like $4 a booster pack.
6347131	6348673	That's some ridiculous amount of money.
6348713	6349373	So remember this.
6349553	6350394	Digimon owes you.
6350574	6351375	Watch it in Japanese.
6351675	6353577	Digimon, I've never seen the Japanese.
6354117	6354818	I have two DVDs.
6354898	6355859	I will show you.
6355879	6356259	Okay, cool.
6356977	6358138	Oh, I remembered my F.U.
6358178	6358338	now.
6359019	6359359	F.U.
6359379	6361622	to my back for looking all ugly, and F.U.
6361822	6365245	me for being tall, because now I have nasty-ass stretch marks on my back.
6365725	6368528	They're the most disgusting stretch marks of all time.
6369869	6370129	Really?
6371231	6372332	No, they're so disgusting.
6372692	6373333	I'll show you later.
6375495	6375755	Right.
6376996	6378037	I have a few more chat rooms.
6378537	6380159	Two more chat room F.U.s, and then we're done.
6381080	6381820	EOSFVB!
6383203	6383643	Did you do it already?
6383663	6384744	Says it's name change time.
6385205	6388487	I did do him already, but I'm giving the correct pronunciation.
6388547	6390669	It's E-O-S-F-B-E-B.
6393191	6393531	Whatever.
6395233	6397014	And Andrew did submit an F-U after all.
6397054	6398035	He says F-U-Rob.
6398315	6398675	Thank you.
6398956	6399716	Fuck you too, bitch.
6401798	6402218	That's it.
6402318	6403579	Oh, I have to check the mailbag.
6405281	6405881	Mailbox!
6406802	6408263	I predict emptiness.
6408283	6410585	Yeah, I predict emptiness too, but we're gonna check the mailbox.
6417333	6419494	If they don't know where to send emails by now, they're out of luck.
6420034	6425017	Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com We have one unread message.
6428998	6429499	Let's see.
6430599	6431399	I like radio.
6431740	6432540	I like oranges.
6432820	6433640	I like lounges.
6433860	6435101	I like Orange Lounge Radio.
6435181	6436222	Wow, what a concept.
6436862	6437362	Beautiful.
6440583	6442304	I like anything that's on a happy note.
6442564	6445266	No alias, just a Ryan G. We like you, Ryan G.
6446707	6447468	You're cool.
6447968	6451872	He's a real G. What up, G?
6452913	6454854	Alright, we're going to take another break.
6454874	6457176	Coming from the room full of the most cracker-ass people.
6459819	6460619	F you to crack us.
6464497	6467540	On that note, we're going to take a quick break and we will come back.
6467840	6472564	And at that point, we're going to do a little segment we call List List.
6473524	6476567	And it's a five-person list list tonight, so it should be exciting.
6477227	6479849	The topic is very interesting.
6479890	6480690	That's all I have to say.
6481591	6483492	So, here we go.
6483532	6484493	We're taking another quick break.
6484553	6485514	We'll be back in a little bit.
6485814	6486375	See ya.
6557729	6558353	Thanks for watching!
6734162	6734804	Thanks for watching!
6794180	6796424	Thank you for watching!
6812182	6814403	I can't wait until I find the real tomorrow.
6814423	6816584	SAKEDOWN Music that sounds like an explosion.
6816664	6817524	A rising tension.
6817584	6818164	It doesn't go far.
6818184	6819765	It's an engine development.
6819825	6820545	I'll jump on this wind.
6820605	6821926	All the light and sadness.
6822046	6822766	I'll throw them all away.
6822826	6825647	I'm not the kind of person who likes boring sad things.
6846039	6847462	Thank you for watching!
6873715	6879640	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge being on a music and more show?
6879660	6886806	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
6887126	6889127	It's unearthly.
6889348	6893091	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
6895032	6895373	Hi.
6895953	6897654	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6897674	6898135	We're back.
6898535	6900557	No one would dance with that guy even if he did ask.
6901057	6903319	The only decent DDR film ever made, by the way.
6905557	6906578	That was fucking hilarious.
6906798	6908241	Oh, I'm sorry, Loki disagrees.
6908261	6910344	That was stupid.
6911566	6912747	He disagrees it was decent.
6913484	6914184	Let's do our list list.
6944144	6948747	Some people have a very big experience in their wrist action, so that should help for them.
6949988	6954631	But... You know, hey, I know people that freestyle playing 2DX, namely me.
6954931	6955251	It's fun.
6957248	6963431	So, um, I think that, uh... So let's explain, because this is the season premiere and we have some new people listening.
6963691	6965552	Let's explain what listless is.
6965752	6968453	And it's not list list, it's list less.
6969374	6973476	So, um, listless is the segment... Now they get it.
6973896	6975557	I just talk funny, I'm sorry.
6976557	6980499	Listless... Quirky!
6981140	6981220	Um...
6982220	6986983	This segment of the show, we make the definitive list on some topic.
6987023	6990764	And basically the way it works is that we're all going to name our top three.
6991405	6998028	So we'll have a list of 15 beverages that are great to play, or that are great to drink while playing DDR, 2DX, whatever.
6998668	7002490	And then we'll all go around the room and everybody eliminates one thing from the list.
7002991	7009914	And then the chat room will vote to decide the ultimate DDR beverage, Bimani beverage.
7010935	7011115	So...
7013641	7014381	That's how it works.
7014421	7018262	And if you ever saw the old VH1 show, The List, nothing to do with it.
7018562	7019783	Absolutely nothing to do with that.
7019823	7020643	Nothing at all.
7021463	7022963	Okay, so... Wait, wait.
7023804	7025824	That show is the stupidest fucking show ever.
7026104	7032866	Because, okay, they let the audience pick their favorite that gets put on the list, but the audience already picked their favorite.
7033286	7034986	So, why wouldn't they just pick it again?
7035066	7039748	The reason why that show sucked is that Lauryn Hill somehow ended up on every single list they ever did.
7040068	7044089	It could be Best Male Artist of the 80s, and Lauryn Hill was number one.
7044209	7044809	Every time.
7045329	7045849	Every time.
7046969	7048690	She did one good album.
7048950	7049650	One good album.
7049910	7052851	I mean, unless you count the Fugees, but you don't, because that wasn't a solo thing.
7053031	7054051	But anyway, that's a whole other rant.
7054131	7055331	Let's go for our list list.
7055412	7057512	I'll do an F you to Lauryn Hill fans next week.
7058232	7060613	So, because I'm special, I'll start.
7062143	7065124	My number three is Oxygenated Water.
7065884	7067064	Oxygenated Water.
7067384	7072866	I don't remember the brand, but I bought Oxygenated Water one time, and I felt like absolutely freaking refreshed after it.
7072886	7073606	It was really cool.
7073626	7079168	Did you just do the same thing as by shaking up a bottle of water?
7079188	7082429	I mean, that's what's Oxygenated.
7082469	7084609	This is like super Oxygenated Water.
7084649	7085029	I don't know.
7085269	7087170	But it was kind of cool, and I felt a little lightheaded.
7088210	7090191	So, um, yeah.
7090211	7090471	Next.
7091859	7095060	Loki, your number three choice for best beverage for Bologna.
7095080	7096720	I suddenly really drink one thing.
7098041	7101602	The rest are just going to be what I would be drinking if I wasn't drinking one thing.
7102042	7103982	I'm going to have to say a 40-ounce malt liquor.
7109324	7110124	That's the winner.
7110424	7111224	No need to add anything.
7111264	7113905	All right, 40-ounce malt liquor.
7114445	7115725	A cult 45.
7115905	7118346	We're going to have Billy Dee Williams come out and play DDR.
7120439	7123141	Okay, now... Dave, you're number three, Vic.
7123601	7124001	Yeah.
7125102	7133628	Um, I don't really drink too many varieties of drinks, or soft drinks, or power drinks, or, you know, sports drinks, or whatever.
7134368	7144915	But, I know that one drink that gets me hyper as fuck, so I can play Keto and get all the way to Max X, is Jolt, because that gets me so, like... Jolt!
7145636	7146977	All the sugar and twice the caffeine.
7147717	7149038	That's what got me through college, by the way.
7149659	7149939	Yes.
7151656	7152016	Jolt.
7152196	7156439	Okay, Black Lab, your number three choice for best Pomani beverage.
7156459	7156959	All righty here.
7158700	7164704	As you may not know, the only DDR machine in Davis is in the Tapioca Express.
7164844	7165264	Excuse me.
7165584	7174630	So, appropriately enough, the drink that I usually get every time I go in there would be a strawberry snow bubble from the Tapioca Express.
7174650	7176111	It's kind of like a Slurpee.
7176131	7178732	So you're specifically stating a strawberry snow bubble?
7178932	7179472	Yes, I am.
7179493	7179593	Okay.
7179613	7179873	Okay.
7180453	7181514	Just wanted to double check.
7181935	7183276	Well, well, yeah.
7183736	7185017	I know, it'll get wiped out pretty easy.
7185057	7198670	I just need something to fill space, but... Yeah, it was... It's like, kind of like a Slurpee, except it's like, they use like a special syrup in it, and it's kind of like they use milk in it too, so it's like milky, and it's like really, really, really, really good.
7199551	7202093	And plus it's really good when you have tapioca in it too.
7202894	7203134	Yeah.
7204015	7206038	Alright, Strawberry Snowbubble from Black Lab.
7206498	7215950	My number three pick for best Vimani beverage, and if you've ever been to one of my infamous house parties, you'll know why I'm naming this one.
7216410	7218332	My number three pick is Goldschlager.
7222317	7222598	Yes.
7223496	7228398	Instant Fun, Just Add Goldschlager is my number three pick.
7228418	7230239	That's all I have to say.
7230299	7234940	For all the kiddies, it basically tastes like drinking cough syrup, but it fucks you right up.
7235361	7237121	It just fucks you right up.
7237321	7238582	Here I am trying to be healthy.
7238662	7241923	Okay, my number two pick is Berry Propel.
7242123	7242964	Berry Propel.
7242984	7247946	And the thing is, I usually have this with me more often than my number one choice because my number one choice is harder to find.
7248546	7248946	However...
7250518	7257100	There's a bottle of Berry Propel freaking sitting in Rob's refrigerator because I bought it, but I had to have my vanilla Coke first.
7258320	7261581	All right, so Berry Propel is Jamie's number two drink.
7262461	7264921	Loki, your number two pick for best banani beverage.
7266362	7276684	Well, as I stated before, I don't really have anything other than my number one pick, so I'm going to have to go with imported Mexican tap water.
7281534	7283255	I'm sorry, imported Mexican what?
7283535	7284016	Tequila?
7284716	7286417	I'm sorry, tap water?
7286517	7286577	Ew!
7288098	7288719	Yuck!
7289219	7291941	It's not with the cayenne pepper to go with it, it'd be for pooping.
7292381	7294283	Imported Mexican tap water.
7295183	7305050	By the way, little known fact for people who don't have the, you know, years of natural healing experience that I do, if you're going to go to Mexico and drink the water...
7305859	7309941	Better eat cayenne pepper before you do, because it will keep you from shitting all over everything.
7312622	7312963	Okay.
7313143	7313903	Oh, Jesus.
7314423	7314843	Alright.
7315764	7316284	Um, where are we?
7316324	7317765	Dave, yes, your number two choice.
7317785	7320246	Well, I'm not sure I can beat imported Mexican tap water.
7320947	7325489	But, um, my number two choice is, uh, Vanilla Coke Icy.
7325869	7327430	Because those things are hella good.
7327850	7329291	And they're really, really sweet.
7329351	7331292	Like, twice as sweet as a normal Vanilla Coke.
7331452	7332572	Vanilla Coke Icy.
7332612	7333153	Good choice.
7333193	7333593	Good choice.
7334724	7336805	Quackwab, you're number two pick, please.
7337565	7342587	This one of mine is just like a recently discovered thing, I just tried it out once, it was like, oh, this is hella good!
7343087	7350410	It's, uh, it's made by Snapple, it's the Atomic Elements drink, which is Jack Apple flavor.
7350930	7361553	It's got caffeine and ginseng and a bunch of other good shit that keeps me awake and hella hyper, and that's one of the things that I had last night to help contribute to my 2D expansion.
7363454	7363915	Very nice.
7364655	7365536	My number two pick?
7367578	7370101	My number two pick was Red Bull and Malibu.
7371182	7375566	However, at the risk of sounding like a lush, I'm just going to cut that to Red Bull.
7377087	7378789	Oh, the drink that looks like urine.
7379089	7380511	Yes, the drink that smells like pussy.
7382223	7383064	Or so I've heard.
7383344	7384684	It actually does look like urine.
7385365	7386225	Yeah, it does look like pee.
7386705	7389367	But you know, my favorite bar has it now where it comes out of the spray.
7389647	7391168	Like, they don't even have to open up the cans anymore.
7391188	7392188	It's just right in the tap.
7392568	7394509	It's like Pepsi, Sprite, Red Bull.
7394990	7395550	Fucking rules.
7396310	7398591	Alright, so now we're down to our number one picks.
7398712	7401353	Jamie, your number one best Behmany beverage.
7402406	7407932	Well, I have often said that one of these days I'm actually going to own one of the vending machines for this beverage.
7408552	7413617	I have ordered this stuff plenty of times and brought it in to our Viggo to play and drink and stuff.
7414318	7417261	Pocari Sweat, the drink that actually does look like sweat.
7417702	7419063	And it tastes much better than Gatorade.
7420885	7421766	Pocari Sweat.
7422246	7422486	Yes.
7422587	7423007	Alright.
7424028	7424829	It's sweatalicious.
7425902	7428663	Pokari Sweat is kind of an intimidating name to me, I don't know.
7430663	7432664	I don't know how I feel about Pokari Sweat, but anyway.
7433764	7435145	Let's move right along, shall we?
7435405	7438566	Loki, your number one pick for best bemani beverage.
7439026	7442347	Uh, I'm just gonna go with Surge, because I love that stuff, it's good.
7443167	7443768	Surge!
7445248	7447829	Surge sounds like it should be with Slim Jim, I don't know, but anyway.
7448989	7451350	Alright, so Surge, which they don't even make anymore, correct?
7452233	7452934	Did they still make it?
7453054	7453794	Did they?
7453914	7454655	I don't know where to get it.
7455115	7455335	No.
7456176	7459198	Dave, your number one pick for best Baymadi beverage.
7459338	7464923	I can't believe I was like, after I said Vanilla Coca-Icy, I completely forgot what I was going to say for this one, but I finally remembered.
7465343	7466064	Hawaiian Punch.
7466944	7471768	Because they sell that down at the shell for like 99 cents for a two liter.
7472028	7476372	And I remember the days when it's raining and everyone runs over there and buys like ten of them.
7476612	7479374	And then you all just take them back and put them in between the two DVR machines.
7480322	7481703	Would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?
7482744	7483185	Punch.
7485707	7486588	Don't punch!
7487329	7490572	Blackwab, your number one choice, please, for Best Pay Money Beverage.
7491593	7495217	As the people in the room can see, I have a hat on.
7495497	7497359	It has the logo splattered all over it.
7498440	7503105	And for those of you that aren't in the room and can't see it, it happens to be Mountain Dew Code Red.
7504660	7506241	It is fucking addicting to me.
7506961	7507302	I get it.
7507802	7509243	I always get leaders of it.
7509463	7509923	All the time.
7510043	7512685	I probably go through maybe... Well, let's see.
7512705	7513065	Actually, no.
7513085	7516227	I have two cases of cans in my dorm room right now.
7517247	7518288	One of which is in the fridge.
7518968	7522330	And I have Mountain Dew Code Red stuff on my walls.
7522350	7525032	That shit tastes worse than Cherry Nightville.
7526152	7526793	It does not.
7527953	7528053	No!
7531977	7533341	Touch code red and die!
7533642	7535468	Alright, my number one pick.
7536350	7536531	Now...
7537779	7545903	Those of you know, I know we have a lot of people from Vegas in the chat room, so I know you guys will agree with me on this one, because this is the best Bimani drink I've ever had.
7546023	7547504	I had the most fun playing Bimani.
7547544	7548465	Who's in Vegas?
7548485	7550065	We have a few people from Vegas in the chat room.
7550085	7550826	Isn't, like, Eos?
7551046	7552527	Yes, I believe they're from Vegas.
7552627	7554087	And Maple also, right?
7554228	7555128	No, Maple's in the Vegas.
7555388	7555768	Oh, really?
7556088	7556729	Okay, never mind.
7556929	7558730	You don't know what you're talking about.
7558910	7560571	I believe VidPower's from Vegas.
7560591	7562052	We have some other folks there.
7563439	7564821	Anyway, can I finish?
7564841	7565262	Can I finish?
7565402	7565562	No.
7565943	7568947	So those of you in Vegas know about the Hilton.
7569267	7571571	And the Hilton's got this little place called the Star Trek Experience.
7571591	7573213	And at that experience, they sell a drink.
7573233	7573574	Oh, you bitch.
7574375	7576458	The Warp Core Breach, ladies and gentlemen.
7576478	7577780	I fucking love the Warp Core Breach.
7579540	7582983	I have done Drunken DDR on the Warp Core Breach and it is the shit.
7583303	7584324	Warp Core Breach.
7584604	7593591	Seven different kinds of Bacardi, Asobi, and Razzmatazz all mixed together in a fishbowl served with dry ice and they won't serve it to just one person.
7594231	7595793	Well, you can't order a one-person serving.
7595913	7597594	Oh yeah, they have it different now.
7597614	7599475	You can't order a one-person serving.
7599876	7601397	The DDR Freak Moderator's Trip.
7602217	7603699	I have a friend that lives in Vegas.
7604319	7604920	My friend Ciara.
7606048	7612340	There was me and Iguana Girl and her boyfriend Islander and my friend Tiara and her man.
7612560	7613622	We all go to the Warp Corp.
7614464	7618932	We all go to the Star Trek experience and proceed to go on the ride once.
7619904	7621185	Then have a warp core breach.
7621885	7623066	Go on the ride again.
7623126	7627949	That's exactly what I did at the 25th RockyCon, which was the first time I ever saw DDR, by the way.
7627969	7638276	Well, my friends left, and it was just me and Iguana Girl and Islander, and we all decided that we were going to go over to Circus Circus and play DDR in there.
7638456	7644339	That's exactly what I ended up doing, and I ended up... I believe I threw up the Romulan chicken strips later that night.
7644460	7646741	It was a tribute to that first time on DDR.
7648022	7648102	Uh...
7649080	7652101	And it was, half the tab was broken.
7652941	7657243	And it was just like the... Drunken DDR is cool.
7657483	7658603	Drunken DDR rules.
7658623	7662464	Especially on a Warp Corp, because we were like plenty drunk after we played DDR.
7662965	7663565	Anyway.
7664365	7665305	So now here we do it.
7665345	7666026	We have a list.
7666146	7670307	This is a... I was not expecting the list to look this diverse, that's for sure.
7670927	7672708	A few notable exceptions.
7672928	7676329	According to our chatroom, we have made a few notable exceptions, including...
7677874	7678275	Water.
7679796	7680978	I said oxygenated water.
7681198	7683520	Pepsi Blue is the big thing right now.
7683540	7684581	That stuff is shit.
7684862	7687705	It tastes like someone ate strawberries and puked them.
7688205	7693511	I was thinking about that, but Vanilla Coke Icy's like so own that, because they do.
7694031	7695633	That Pepsi Blue shit is nasty.
7697125	7699708	I heard it makes you shit green, but I haven't really tested that.
7699728	7701250	Anyway, nope, nope, alright.
7701270	7704173	And then, uh, also, uh, Pussy Juice was another suggestion.
7718346	7721869	I was actually thinking of saying that, but then I was like, no.
7722130	7725333	Red Fusion, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.
7725373	7727414	You know what, let's just go ahead and vote.
7727675	7729697	You know, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.
7729717	7731838	So they didn't make the list, so F you.
7732759	7733500	Here's our list.
7733740	7736643	Oxygenated water, 40 ounce malt liquor, Jolt,
7736883	7751039	Strawberry Snowbubble, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Imported Mexican Tap Water, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Red Bull, Picari Sweat, Surge, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
7752040	7755361	So, we're going to start eliminating shit from this list right now.
7755481	7757542	Jamie, what the fuck's coming off this list?
7757582	7758962	The imported Mexican tap water.
7759503	7765625	I would prefer not to play DDR until they have explosive diarrhea.
7765685	7767345	Diarrhea, diarrhea revolution.
7767465	7770326	So, imported Mexican tap water's coming off the list.
7771426	7773007	And we have a cry.
7773827	7775648	Loki, what's coming off the list?
7776568	7782637	I'm going to have to say goodbye to Red Bull because, yeah, it does look like pee.
7782837	7786483	It smells like pee and probably is pee, but that's all right.
7787094	7788395	All right, so Red Bull's gone.
7789555	7789995	Fine.
7790495	7791116	But you know what?
7791136	7796018	You gotta mix it with Malibu, but I didn't want to sound like a lush, because I don't know if you realize, but all my other drinks are alcoholic.
7796078	7796478	So anyway.
7799059	7799339	Okay.
7799779	7801020	Dave, what's coming off the list?
7801280	7809783	Having not had most of these, such as the Warp Core Breach or something like that, or, you know, Goldschlager... You're just gonna have to trust us.
7809923	7811864	I think... Yeah, I know.
7812264	7815926	I think I'll take off the Strawberry Snowbubble, because... What...
7816946	7823750	I mean, it would seem like it would be too heavy to play DDR afterwards if it was all milky.
7824191	7827052	I know, but it just doesn't seem like the type of DDR drink.
7827413	7832376	Oh, I think they'll go have a strawberry snow bubble and go play Waka Laka.
7832416	7835217	I wouldn't have been able to do that in the first place because it's only a max one.
7835618	7837079	Strawberry snow bubbles off the list.
7837119	7837439	All right.
7838468	7841311	Black Lab, what's coming off this list of what's left here?
7841371	7843714	Yeah, let's see.
7844274	7851662	As original as some of these are, I'd say the 40 ounce has to go.
7851682	7854044	That's just a bit too much liquid to drink.
7854064	7856307	40 ounce malt liquors coming off the list.
7856934	7858196	You just made Billy Dee cry.
7860038	7861520	I would like to watch him cry.
7861800	7868809	When I come home from a hard day of playing DDR, I like to relax with a nice ice cold Colt 45.
7869610	7872474	Oh, another notable exception we left off the list.
7872654	7873074	Balls.
7874278	7876399	Balls!
7876459	7877900	Let's give Balls the honorable mention.
7877940	7878881	Nope.
7878901	7880362	Balls got forgotten.
7880442	7882063	Obviously none of us are drinking Balls.
7882984	7886846	And I'd say maybe if we thought of it before we started eliminating drinks, then yes.
7886926	7888127	But no, too late now.
7888227	7888668	Too late now.
7889988	7891309	It gets an honorable mention.
7891549	7891970	How's that?
7892370	7893571	Balls gets an honorable mention.
7896317	7897258	I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
7899540	7901442	Yes, you have to repeat it.
7901502	7906066	Black Lab said... Okay, I said, I had never had balls.
7907027	7908408	Referring to the drink.
7908868	7910210	Blue balls on top of that.
7911270	7912351	Anyway, can I finish?
7912371	7913432	Do I get to take my drink off now?
7913452	7914413	Whatever.
7914593	7916295	My drink, this is an easy pick for me.
7916335	7919478	I think this stuff tastes like turpentine, cat pee, I hate it.
7919818	7920619	Bye bye, Surge.
7920879	7921540	I hate Surge.
7924114	7925075	I fucking love search.
7925095	7928616	Dude, this is the first time that none of mine have been eliminated ever.
7928656	7929636	I've been keeping track.
7929676	7930637	Poor Matt is denied.
7930657	7931597	The first time ever.
7931937	7932737	You are denied.
7932758	7936059	For those keeping score at home, all of Loki's picks got eliminated.
7937919	7938840	And how does that make you feel?
7940180	7940760	That's right.
7941901	7942181	I'll live.
7943004	7944626	God, Surge tastes like shit.
7944686	7946147	Okay, important message.
7946528	7951012	Okay, if you don't like Surge, you can drink that Pesty Blue shit.
7952074	7952414	Yes.
7952434	7953855	For the record, yes.
7953895	7956979	For Lamb's Blood, but, you know, I didn't add that on there.
7957119	7958040	Lamb's Blood?
7958440	7959822	You're a sick bastard.
7960751	7963713	How about, like, cow brain mucus?
7964174	7964514	All right.
7966856	7968337	Yuck, you guys are weird.
7968357	7970138	You guys are so weird.
7970538	7980466	I'm sure it was the time that we were at Brookfields and Sheepham ordered, what was it, a monkey's brain or something?
7981187	7981747	I don't remember.
7981787	7982608	I don't think I was there.
7982628	7984109	That was great.
7984129	7985490	No, but he ordered it.
7989626	7991728	I'm loading up a song here to play during the break here.
7995411	8002216	Hi, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to have Jamie read the list and then I'll paste it in the chat room and you guys will have five minutes to vote.
8002676	8005999	So, Jamie, would you please let me post it in the chat room.
8006019	8008621	You've got to send me your vote over a private message in the chat room.
8010823	8013184	Jamie, would you be so kind as to read this list off?
8014045	8015646	There, unhighlighted.
8015846	8016707	Oxygenated water.
8018368	8018969	Goldslugger.
8019614	8029757	Berry Propel, Vanilla Cook IC, Snapple Atomic Elements, Bokari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
8030877	8031858	All right, so there it is.
8031938	8034258	Send me your votes over private message in the chat room.
8034278	8036279	If they don't come over private message, they don't count.
8036779	8039120	In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break.
8039620	8041240	I'm just trying to cue up some music for you guys.
8041980	8042961	No, just to...
8044401	8048403	Just to reiterate for you guys, no, what you vote for will not be taken off the list.
8048443	8049284	We've already done that.
8049324	8050445	That was all done in-house.
8050665	8052546	We're the celebrities, so we get to do that.
8052926	8054227	You guys are picking the winners.
8054307	8055868	You guys are picking the top three.
8055928	8059150	So out of that list, you're just going to send me your favorite.
8060150	8065955	and whatever gets the most votes wins.
8066055	8068578	First place and whatever gets second most votes gets second place.
8068838	8071460	So you're voting for your very favorite out of that list.
8071800	8079287	In the meantime, here's a song that is often requested on the station ever since we played it on one of Jamie's... No, not Dirty.
8079387	8081289	Dirty is requested, but it's not that.
8081909	8086773	It's something that Jamie put on one of her pre-shows and everybody's loved it since then, so we're going to play it during the actual show.
8087675	8088337	Here you go.
8088457	8089762	You got five minutes to vote.
8090023	8090726	We'll be right back.
8091729	8093636	Let's play some Tetris, motherfucker.
8157669	8159390	And you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
8184924	8187946	And you feel it, feel it And you feel it, feel it
8395083	8395624	Thanks for watching!
8454978	8455720	Thanks for watching!
8483442	8484182	Thanks for watching!
8554673	8563239	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
8563279	8569243	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
8569483	8580750	Hi, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just finished up, or we're finishing up, we're bringing an end to our listless segment, where we are determining the best Behmany drink.
8581151	8582732	And this was the final list, what Dave?
8583172	8585313	I just beat Spin the Disc on 2DX and 7.
8586313	8586773	Wow.
8586913	8588313	Yay, that's my fifth seven star.
8588953	8590654	All the girls want to have sex with you now.
8590954	8591634	Oh, yeah.
8591754	8593134	How many girls are even listening?
8593514	8595235	I don't know how many girls are listening.
8595275	8596415	I don't get that kind of breakdown.
8596835	8597195	Twin.
8597635	8597955	Anyway.
8598676	8599456	We're kidding.
8599476	8602456	Oh.
8602616	8602917	Newt.
8603137	8603477	Newt.
8603597	8603817	Newt.
8603877	8604177	Anyway.
8606525	8607266	This is the list.
8607506	8617112	Oxygenated Water, Jolt, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Pocari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
8617292	8618393	And now... Wait, hold on, hold on.
8618553	8618813	What?
8619033	8622856	I just have to say, if, like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date him.
8623016	8623576	Anyway!
8623776	8624517	She's in a lesbian drive.
8624577	8625157	Anyway!
8626318	8627339	What does that have to do with the money?
8627359	8627999	That is not cool.
8628760	8629420	Not cool.
8629780	8631642	Spreading personal information out on the radio.
8631682	8631882	Nope.
8632512	8635234	Oh yeah, after you're talking about your whole hooker experience.
8635915	8637976	Hey, that is me sharing, okay?
8638036	8639577	That's not me sharing about someone else.
8641239	8643921	I apologize if the hooker was listening to the radio show.
8644021	8645422	I didn't mean anything about it.
8645902	8649865	Call me.
8649885	8652127	Can we read the list now, or should we just throw the list away?
8652787	8658031	No, but I haven't read the top three, the climax of this whole segment.
8658051	8658091	Oh.
8661055	8663697	Surely you guys wouldn't let me get through a segment without climaxing.
8663737	8664337	No guy would.
8664537	8665238	Surely Temple.
8666158	8666598	Okay, go.
8667199	8667539	Alright.
8668680	8674083	The number three best Bomani drink is Hawaiian Punch.
8674103	8677165	Yay, Hawaiian Punch.
8677805	8679026	Hey, want a Hawaiian Punch?
8679947	8680447	Bam!
8680527	8680847	Alright.
8683029	8688052	The number two best Bomani drink is a Vanilla Coke Icy.
8688092	8688332	Yay!
8691710	8692830	Damn all you trendy whores.
8692970	8693570	No, I'm just kidding.
8694110	8695071	Vanilla Coke Iced, these are good.
8695791	8703812	And the number one best Behmany drink of all time is... Pocari Sweat.
8706933	8708053	Jamie is a winner.
8708373	8710973	This is the second one I've gotten the first place on.
8714854	8715954	Alright, so there you go.
8716034	8717135	That is the list.
8718615	8719395	That was cool.
8720208	8722176	That's it, I know, we still got a half hour of show left.
8722216	8723400	We don't end at 9 anymore, we end at 9.30.
8723982	8724665	Yes, Loki!
8724846	8725046	What?
8725899	8727940	We've got plenty to fill a half an hour.
8728300	8729541	And this is Bomani?
8729941	8732062	No, it's Bomani stuff, not another hooker story.
8732082	8734984	I only have one hooker story and I just used it.
8735864	8736705	Sim update.
8736985	8739046	We've got plenty of stuff to talk about.
8739126	8745310	Okay, first thing, Tourney Mix 3 has been finally announced officially, so it's on.
8745850	8750032	Judging will begin sometime, I don't know, I don't have the dates in front of me.
8750692	8754655	I know it ends on the 31st, that's when the results will be posted, but
8755615	8760916	A lot of... I guess December 15th is when they start doing it.
8760936	8762096	Can't hear you unless you're talking to the mic.
8762116	8763076	Whatever, it doesn't matter.
8763457	8769858	Anyways, so... Yeah, it's on, so just, you know, go check out the rules because there's plenty of them.
8770178	8774559	You need to... They're really being strict about what they're doing this time, so do check that out.
8775919	8777819	Also, there's another tournament going on.
8777919	8779860	I'm not even sure what it is.
8780060	8780360	It's like...
8781440	8786386	I don't know, it's some other sim tournament that I really wasn't paying attention to.
8787347	8795276	Yeah, it's out there too, so I'm sure someone will... Oh yes, and MakeEditGetPorn, that is still going on, so don't forget about that one.
8795356	8800622	One thing I forgot to ask about the MakeEditGetPorn contest is everybody who enters get porn, or just the winners?
8800862	8801522	Just the winners.
8801842	8802423	Just making sure.
8802443	8804664	I was going to say, that's a lot of porn for you to be sending out.
8805264	8807725	I could do it, but... So just the winners.
8807785	8808245	Just the top three.
8808265	8809626	Just the winners will get porn.
8809926	8811107	Third place gets a little porn.
8811147	8812247	Second place gets... Nope.
8812607	8813528	Just first place.
8814268	8814428	Oh.
8815009	8817510	The first place person is going to get all the porn?
8817990	8818210	Yeah.
8818230	8819711	That's a lot of porn.
8819731	8820151	We'll see.
8820171	8822052	We'll see how much porn I can acquire from...
8822552	8828277	And we're going to have an honorary... You have to specify if you want girl porn or boy porn, because there is going to be a boy porn prize.
8828417	8830799	Okay, well, not by me, but... We'll find something.
8830879	8832620	Orange Lounge will donate a boy porn prize.
8833340	8833661	Okay.
8834241	8837003	But anyways, yeah, Max Beats is the other one.
8837644	8841467	That's the other contest going on there, and there's like five categories entered there.
8841507	8843228	No prizes for that, but yeah, it's fine.
8843608	8845330	So go check that one out, too.
8846391	8850394	And, see, other than that, there's been some updates...
8850774	8854737	DWI finally decided to update their stuff.
8855378	8857279	So now they're trying to play catch up.
8857319	8859181	They're, I guess, playing catch up.
8859241	8866226	Anyways, they added the extra stage support for that, which Step Mania's had for a while now.
8866787	8870189	And they're also fixing a few other bugs.
8870209	8873312	They're still a good mile behind Step Mania.
8874473	8878496	No updates on Step Mania, but it's pretty good so far, so just check it out.
8880437	8886841	Other than that, DDRUK, they are putting together a lot of synced sets, full sets of files to download.
8886861	8890444	They have full sets of Disney's Rave.
8891064	8893006	Well, I have to say that's not completely full.
8893026	8896048	They're missing some of the double steps, but I mean, for the most part.
8896208	8897829	That's just if you're being anal retentive.
8897909	8899910	Yes, for the most part, it's complete.
8900410	8904933	They also have full sets of Euromix 1 and 2, all synced.
8905354	8908856	And they have Club Mix, the club of pens on there.
8909825	8913169	You're starting a fight here in the chatroom, StepMania versus DWI.
8914431	8915171	Oh, I don't care.
8916413	8917074	Let them fight!
8917594	8918696	Let them kill each other!
8919597	8927986	Anyway, so, yeah, those, go check that out, and I know for a fact, because I kind of help, that there will be a MOHA stuff.
8930128	8933971	Yes, Jamie has a question Have they ever done any of the Tokimeki songs?
8934011	8934471	Yep, all of them
8960639	8963260	I still haven't figured out how to get to that point, because I have Tokimeki 2.
8963300	8965440	Yeah, I have all of them.
8965480	8967521	I'm sure they'll be releasing a pack for that, too.
8968401	8969141	Let's see.
8969901	8972182	I'm actually considering entering Tourney Mix 3, by the way.
8972222	8974902	I have to ask you if my song's been used before, though, but I'll ask you off-air.
8975082	8975683	The one I want to do.
8975983	8980364	Well, I've already... See, this is what I've been doing today, is deciding which song I want to do.
8980424	8983845	I've narrowed it down to a couple options.
8983905	8985725	I already know, but I have a feeling it's been done.
8985985	8990768	Okay, number one was Things of Manory, and that was by Tack.
8991328	8992949	You'll instantly get my vote.
8993230	8998433	It's a six minute long song, I just cut it down to just over two and a half minutes.
8998953	9000094	So I have that one.
9000634	9005557	I have an 80s track that's being remixed, which is so far in the lead in my picks.
9005897	9010100	It's Amanda, originally by Boston, and it's covered by Brooklyn Queens.
9010180	9011241	It's a Ford's Transmix.
9011821	9015823	It's a really catchy song, so maybe we can play that later.
9015843	9017183	Oh, I've heard of this album.
9017724	9018904	So it's pretty sweet.
9018924	9020405	This is like another 80s trance.
9020445	9022225	I'm going to need to copy this before you leave, okay?
9022345	9022886	Yeah, okay.
9022926	9024006	It's got Journey on it.
9024046	9024486	Cool.
9025367	9025527	Yeah.
9025547	9026547	But it's not really Journey.
9026727	9028188	It's like an update.
9028268	9030049	I bought an album just like this the other day.
9030109	9030829	That's so crazy.
9031129	9031909	What album did you get?
9032130	9032590	I got one.
9032650	9033930	It's called Time After Time.
9033970	9034290	Damn it!
9034330	9035511	That's the one I've been looking for.
9035671	9036251	I got that one.
9036291	9037152	I need to get a copy of that.
9037172	9037372	Okay.
9037392	9037992	Sweet.
9038632	9039793	Anyways, back on the subject.
9041300	9042361	Back on the subject here.
9043081	9045622	Also, you've got a random Beatmania track.
9045762	9048864	I was looking at Hyperboundary Gate or Alien World.
9049104	9051365	I think that's by Ping Pong.
9051605	9053726	It's from Beatmania the final, I think.
9054226	9055907	But I was deciding between one of those.
9055947	9059789	But it's probably going to be Amanda because it's just a catchy song.
9059909	9066732	I don't think I've recognized the original, but it's just a catchy song and it'll be fun.
9066912	9069413	So now you're going to get five people doing that because they all heard you were going to do it.
9069433	9070574	They're all going to copy you.
9070934	9072375	That's fine, whatever, I don't care.
9072916	9075978	But yeah, has that ever happened in those contests where two people end up doing the same song?
9076158	9079801	Yeah, there was one with Mr. Larpus, I think.
9080902	9082964	That was Tourney Mix 1, they did that.
9083064	9084205	Dope.
9084225	9085546	They both end up losing, huh?
9086987	9088408	because they cancel each other's votes out.
9088768	9090628	That's why I've got to make sure my song hasn't been done before.
9090648	9094109	Yeah, so I'm doing that one, and it'll be pretty cool.
9094149	9099651	I mean, I'm sure there'll be someone probably doing Sakura and someone probably doing Xenon, which those have been done.
9099731	9103112	I mean, Sakura has 4,000 of them out there, so no one's going to vote for that.
9103432	9105833	And I'm sure BimaniRuler will sneak one out.
9105953	9114856	There's only one song that he has that was being released in the last set of released ones that he didn't quite get out, and that was The Return.
9115436	9121723	My guess, if he was to enter and be lazy and not actually make a new file, it'd be here to release the return.
9122023	9126508	Which, I heard is a really good transtrack, but it's seven minutes long, so that's probably not going to happen.
9127089	9127269	But...
9127813	9128634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9148054	9161442	But yeah, also my site, of course I've got to plug it again, leechfromloki.tk I'm getting to a point where I'm going to try to upload every single Beatmania song I have made right now by other people.
9161602	9162983	I just got a few more the other day.
9163003	9166985	I got Happy Wedding from... Happy to, happy to, happy to...
9167950	9168370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9184580	9186761	There's a few other ones I got files for.
9186781	9188121	So I'm going to be trying to upload.
9188161	9196524	I've got to reformat my whole page just to organize them in style groups and that type of thing so I can actually start uploading them easier that way.
9196564	9198425	But that's a lot of work.
9198465	9200646	Probably come see that next week.
9200686	9201926	Maybe I'll try to upload something tonight.
9202967	9203287	That's it.
9204324	9211533	Oh, oh, and releases, as far as home releases, Dancing Stage Party Edition finally came out.
9212134	9218301	Only problem is it has a huge freaking bug in it, which won't make it play on PS1s or PlayStations.
9218461	9219863	So that kind of sucks.
9219923	9222747	It only plays on PS2s for some reason, even though it's a PS1 game.
9222967	9223488	Whoops.
9226150	9229514	I want a copy of that, because I want to dance to Kylie Minogue.
9230395	9231436	Can't get you out of my head.
9231576	9242949	Well, hey, you know what, I'm sure that... I'm sure you'll see people that are in the UK, like NMR and that kind of stuff, they'll probably rip them.
9243249	9244610	So you'll probably see those out there.
9245351	9246012	Thank you for watching!
9264033	9264634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9284034	9287415	And I guess this is really old news, but it's new to me, and I'm just behind the times.
9287915	9288635	What can I say?
9288795	9292676	There's actually a hack done on Mega Man that's all done with DDR music.
9293117	9293757	I've heard of that.
9295337	9296938	Didn't Aaron in Japan do that one?
9297258	9298438	Yeah, DDR Man.
9298478	9300519	I don't know if he did it, but he's got it on his site.
9300539	9301859	I've got the MIDI files on my computer.
9301879	9302859	I'll bring them next week.
9303139	9305460	I believe we, you know what, I think we did that one episode.
9305480	9306020	You weren't here.
9306080	9306720	We went through it.
9307341	9309221	We talked about Game Boy DDR music.
9309581	9309841	Yes.
9310021	9311462	I've got them to 2DX midis.
9311562	9312242	We could do those.
9313070	9314653	Ah, 2DX Middies, that would be a fun show.
9317697	9321161	Wow, so what else is going on in DDR Bomani world right now?
9322163	9322944	Shaft is over.
9323324	9323925	Shaft is over.
9324226	9327029	I know some big news that's coming up.
9327470	9327650	What?
9327750	9327911	Yes.
9331147	9335148	Okay, well, we've got Southern Hills Golf Land is closing.
9335409	9337269	That was one big news item that came out this week.
9337309	9344032	Shiggle, one of the big golf lands, of course, popular guy, Shiggle Boss over on some of the message boards.
9345232	9348553	And that place is closing.
9348633	9353455	Apparently what's happened is the city council has rezoned that area to be some residential housing.
9354095	9357598	So Shiggle's going to be closing down, and who knows where those games will be going.
9357658	9359880	Probably to the Camelot Golf Land nearby.
9359900	9366106	I was just going to mention that if anyone looked at their calendar this week, they would notice that the 20th falls on a Wednesday next week.
9366526	9370629	And so 20 November, obviously you're going to have a bunch of new stuff going on in the DDR community.
9370649	9371390	Big Bomani thing.
9371470	9374573	I happen to know there's one major website relaunching on 20 November.
9374653	9377996	Yes, the number one... You'll know the spot to go to.
9378056	9378236	Yes.
9379636	9384378	Yes, ddrspot.com is relaunching starting on the 20th, so check that out.
9385158	9388079	I know SoCalKicks' site just relaunched.
9388259	9390360	Actually, he had to cancel it.
9390540	9391360	That was the big news.
9392040	9392760	He had to cancel that.
9393001	9394621	And he has a new tagline, by the way.
9394641	9395921	I'll show this to you guys now.
9396081	9398322	Because remember last week we were talking about the SoCalKicks tagline.
9398622	9403844	And we love SoCalKicks because he did the Orange Lounge website, so we forever owe him sexual favors.
9406232	9406833	No, not just me.
9406873	9408154	But see, now he has new tagline.
9408494	9411037	SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just later.
9412358	9414219	Instead of just now, it'll be just later.
9414760	9416361	That's funny.
9416461	9420986	That kind of sucks for him, but we'll hope that he can get his website back up soon.
9421026	9425570	I know, but MoneyStyle's going to be doing something, and same with 2DXStyle.com.
9425810	9427472	Oh, they're going to be doing some special shit.
9428212	9444615	and maybe Orange Lounge Radio will do a special 20 November fuck off and you know what someone else is probably doing or I should say a certain somebody with a certain journal will be probably talking about 20 November as well since that does come out that day too
9444963	9446403	What about the 19th of November?
9448204	9448524	Yeah.
9449264	9452025	And everybody's neglecting 19 November, which is by far a better song.
9452385	9455546	Dear Diaries, today is 19 November.
9456026	9459987	Today is when I fap it furiously, because tomorrow Politary is coming to my house.
9460467	9462628	And I'll put pictures of the internet in my journal.
9463508	9468030	Speaking of journals, Jamie, you want to talk about the Orange Lounge Live Journal community that we have going now?
9468150	9471471	Yes, I set this up last Sunday right after the show.
9473141	9481786	If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, that is our orange lounge community.
9481826	9483667	And if you wish to join, it's open access.
9483707	9485848	However, if you fuck it up, we'll kick your ass out.
9486889	9490551	And what kind of posts will we expect to be seeing in the orange lounge live journal community?
9490631	9491551	Random shit.
9491731	9492792	Just like this show.
9492952	9501477	Well, basically, you know, those of us who have something to contribute to the show or the BitMoney community, or even things that have been slightly related, like I posted deep thoughts in there because we did talk about it last week.
9502678	9504500	or just, you know, things about the show.
9504680	9508064	You know, we announced the time changes, different things.
9508505	9509606	You know, go ahead and join up.
9509666	9514291	And make sure, by the way, that you actually join the community instead of set it to watch.
9514812	9517174	That way, if you join the community, you can post to it.
9517595	9521079	Also, everybody who is a member of the community is also on the friends list page.
9521199	9522561	But again, don't fuck it up.
9523001	9524183	Yeah, you fuck it up, your ass is out.
9524403	9528589	Yeah, but please post, because I think there's about five or six posts right now.
9528609	9530090	There's five, but there's plenty on the friends list.
9530391	9530851	Oh, boy.
9531452	9532754	You don't want to flood it, though.
9532974	9538642	I mean, so, you know, join, you don't have to post every day, but when you have something orange loungy to say, post it.
9539002	9542847	I hate to disappoint everybody, but I don't update my live journal ever.
9543187	9544369	Well, now you have a reason to.
9544389	9551137	No, because the only time that I talk in the live journal is like, guess what, my sim has a thousand songs now.
9551498	9554221	Guess what, my sim has a thousand and five songs now.
9554722	9555423	So it's just like...
9558414	9559935	We have a question from the chat room.
9560015	9561895	How exactly do I join the community?
9562236	9564616	Well, all you have to do, go to the info page.
9565017	9567157	When you go to the Orange Tops community, there's an info page.
9567177	9567777	It should be user info.
9567978	9569358	And it'll say right at the top.
9569458	9570218	Oh, yeah, user info.
9570258	9570959	It'll say right at the top.
9571059	9573139	If you want to join this community, click here.
9574260	9576581	And you want to list it as a friend, one of your friends.
9576601	9578701	It'll have a picture of a person with a PlaySmart by their head.
9578761	9581902	If you just listed as a friend, you're only going to be watching it.
9581922	9582883	You haven't actually joined it.
9584244	9586626	Oh, yes.
9586666	9596814	If you go to the profile and hit the click here link to join the community, it'll give you the option to set it as part of your Francis automatically, so you don't have to click the separate button on the profile page.
9597995	9598275	Thank you.
9598835	9600276	And we have a link posted in the chat room.
9600556	9603679	And another question, why can't we make it on YouJournal?
9604514	9607295	because everything else is just a rip-off of LiveJournal.
9607515	9609355	Actually, LiveJournal is open source.
9609795	9612455	LiveJournal is open source, so everything else basically rips off it.
9613396	9616956	But if you really, really need a LiveJournal code, I've got a few extra.
9616976	9617896	I have a couple.
9618877	9620837	If I think you don't suck, I'll give you one.
9620857	9624458	Yeah, PM me on a forum you know I'm on, and maybe I'll give you a code.
9625418	9625878	We'll see.
9625998	9626658	Maybe.
9628758	9629398	Maybe.
9629638	9630199	Possibly.
9630419	9631239	Okay, well, other news.
9631379	9632599	Any more money news we've got?
9634406	9642012	Um, no, but I was going to say that if you ever catch me in the chatroom, you can almost guarantee that I'll be throwing up random porn links every now and then.
9642333	9645555	So be sure to check... I'm there!
9646116	9647317	I've never seen you in there.
9648337	9649819	Loki comes in at about midnight.
9650539	9652040	Like, seriously, it's very late night.
9652341	9654282	Look at this chatroom statistics page.
9654322	9654983	He is on there.
9655003	9656344	Just very late at night.
9657335	9660016	He's on there at the under 80 posts, I think.
9660736	9662317	Yes, one of the low posters.
9662357	9667358	He's like, fine, I'm going to post... I think I've seen the channel like twice, okay?
9668279	9668999	I've been in there.
9669299	9670159	I was in there last night.
9670720	9672000	He's in there more often than I am.
9673200	9675261	Well, I'm in there more often than all of y'all.
9675281	9679643	Remember that one time I did the whole, like, you know, I'm making a sim file while I'm chatting thing?
9679843	9680123	Remember?
9681781	9684183	A big thank you, by the way, to all our chatters in the chat room tonight.
9684203	9685844	We've had a record.
9685904	9688305	We were pushing 20 people there at one point in the chat room.
9688345	9691447	So thanks, you guys, for blowing shit up in our chat room.
9691507	9694269	I used to go in the chat room more often, and so I got scared.
9694569	9700092	If you look at the stats, a lot of people are starting to idle more throughout the day and just talk at random points throughout the day.
9700172	9704175	So just come join our chat room.
9705424	9713172	For recent accomplishments, I passed many double Onis, because RVGL's Max 2 machine was on free play.
9713452	9713832	So, yay.
9714633	9720879	Yeah, it was on free play, because every Saturday morning, they turn all the machines on free play, and they have to go around to each one by hand.
9721360	9722300	So, I guess they forgot.
9722320	9722701	It happens.
9723201	9725664	And so, I got to beat lots of ones like Tempo Changer and stuff.
9725684	9726044	It was cool.
9727586	9727766	Yay.
9728559	9736589	Okay, so we're going to take another really quick break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to wrap up the show with final thoughts, and maybe another quick topic.
9736689	9738891	Oh, yes, Loki, before we go to... Really quick last minute.
9739011	9740914	It's kind of an FU that I forgot earlier.
9741294	9743096	Oh, boy.
9743356	9743697	Don't worry.
9743717	9744157	Okay.
9744938	9746620	It's a big FU to RVTL's...
9747998	9749719	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9769472	9771274	and then we will be back so we'll be back very soon
9812094	9812314	OHA!
9812514	9812955	OHA!
9813095	9813355	OHA!
9862782	9864623	The early bird gets the worm!
9864643	9864843	Yeah!
9864863	9865003	Woo!
9865023	9865583	Come on!
9865603	9865863	Get it!
9884582	9887284	Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!
9887945	9889986	Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!
9890026	9893628	Pump that body, pump that body, come on, come on, yeah!
9893648	9898792	Pump that body, pump that body, pump that body, put it, put it, put it, put it on!
9898892	9900133	It's time to scream it!
9900633	9902214	It's time to scream it!
9902434	9903435	It's time to scream it!
9926046	9927527	Music Music Music
9989546	9990347	Thank you for watching!
10073116	10074145	Thank you for watching!
10105319	10106172	Thanks for watching!
10169864	10176709	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
10177575	10183537	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
10183857	10185757	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
10186317	10190659	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
10203024	10204466	You're going to edit that down a little bit.
10204646	10206268	Well, I actually have an edited down version.
10206288	10209912	I thought I burned it on the CD, but that's the CD I listen to in the car, so I guess not.
10210573	10216820	That's Amanda, which was originally done by the 80s group Boston, and this new version is done by Brooklyn Queens.
10216900	10219603	It's a Ford's Transmix and can be found on...
10220223	10222604	Vic Latino presents 80s Now.
10222864	10225306	It's a CD that was on sale at Tower, so go check it out.
10225346	10228967	It's pretty good, but I'd probably recommend Time After Time, which is the CD I was looking for.
10229468	10230248	I don't know.
10230268	10231048	It's okay.
10231309	10231829	It's okay.
10232309	10232729	I bought it.
10233269	10234450	But it's okay.
10234470	10241553	I was on 80s with a kick after playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, so I just had to get some remixed 80s stuff.
10241573	10242334	What is up with this...
10242974	10267778	Grand Theft Auto Vice City, I never played those games, that game, so Dan's store was a fucking nightmare the day that game came out It was full of all stupid people But the CDs, oh my god, the CDs are awesome because they have You know, when you're playing GTA, you can change the station And you have the DJ come up and they say something funny Well, the DJs are on the CDs Introducing some of the tracks The Latina one is absolutely hilarious
10269708	10271111	And there's a new wave one too, which I like.
10274677	10277001	So we're coming into the final home stretch of the show.
10277062	10278805	I thought maybe we'd go around and talk about...
10279583	10281404	Our best Bomani moment of the week.
10282504	10283244	Of the week?
10283424	10284024	Yes, of the week.
10284064	10288866	Okay, Jamie hasn't picked up and played 2DX twice this week.
10288886	10289586	But what did you do?
10290246	10291747	I passed Fantasy on Light 7.
10291827	10292467	So there you go.
10292647	10298249	Okay, I'm always slow on the Bomani games, I will admit it.
10299269	10302210	But I had been trying to beat Fantasy on Light 7 forever.
10302330	10304711	It was one of two songs I had left to do on 4th style.
10305651	10306972	and I've been getting 76, 78, 76, 78.
10308953	10311475	I beat it with a 90% today, so I'm happy.
10311615	10312135	Woohoo!
10312435	10314736	And I'm getting there on Get On Beat.
10315697	10317478	Ooh, yeah!
10317798	10319599	And I almost beat Voltage today.
10320360	10320840	Very cool.
10321540	10323501	In 7 key, by the way, not in like 7.
10324342	10327144	Any Bamani moments of the week you would like to share with us?
10328260	10331522	I didn't really do anything other than download shit off the internet.
10332062	10333382	That was Bomani related.
10333442	10338765	I downloaded more sim files to add something like 1588 now or something like that.
10339545	10341266	But yeah, that's pretty much all I did.
10341406	10343507	Reorganized my sim stuff.
10344468	10348369	Updated some of my files with full sets instead of just the partial shit I had.
10349950	10360478	It's about it, I mean, you know, update my website, you know, fix some links and shit, uh, direct this guy who couldn't speak to, uh, find MP3s, so, like I said.
10361539	10361839	Cool!
10364821	10365942	Black Lab, yes.
10366522	10374128	Besides the obvious part of me now being a bitch of 2DX6 style, um... And 5th style, and 4th style.
10374388	10375109	Yes, that's true.
10376408	10378949	and ThirdStyle, which didn't have Celebrate.
10378969	10380030	I couldn't find Celebrate.
10380050	10381250	Maybe I just don't have it unlocked yet.
10381350	10381630	Anyway.
10382871	10383291	Anyways.
10384952	10385372	Let's see.
10386873	10389394	Other than that, I haven't done shit, Beemani-wise.
10390334	10393035	Haven't been to arcades, haven't been to Tapioca Express to play.
10395276	10399418	I really didn't play that much Beemani when I went home over the weekend.
10400879	10402740	And, yeah, I'm deprived.
10402900	10403560	Help me, please.
10406032	10407454	Oh, Jamie has another one she wants to share.
10408154	10409575	I full comboed Cowgirl.
10410196	10410796	Rad.
10411116	10413898	I'm happy, because gallops are one of my weakest things.
10414479	10417081	Did you go over for Boba and you beat it then?
10417121	10418582	No, this was right after Shaft.
10418622	10421164	I was damn tired, exhausted, and hardly got to eat anything.
10421684	10426668	So right before they were going to take the machine off of event mode, I was like, fuck all of you, I'm going to play, okay?
10426728	10433173	Damn it, I've been running back and forth just so that you people could have a good time, which I'm glad everyone did, and I was really happy.
10433908	10435309	I'm gonna play DDR, hell.
10435669	10437271	So I played Cowgirl, and I full combo'd it.
10437531	10437811	Ownage.
10438151	10440773	Well, I was dead tired, and then I went home and took Vicodin.
10442775	10443715	You took some drugs.
10444676	10445977	Yes, that's for 13 hours.
10446457	10448098	I actually don't know why I came up with this.
10448118	10449479	I don't have any Bimani news to report.
10449520	10450740	I barely played any at all.
10451301	10452322	I played a little 2DX.
10452362	10453643	I haven't passed shit new.
10453683	10455364	I'm still stuck at the same point I was.
10456465	10456485	I...
10457625	10464489	I keep fucking up the last few measures of V, otherwise I could pass the goddamn song on 7-key.
10465150	10467311	I haven't really passed anything else.
10467331	10468532	I'm getting closer to DXY.
10468652	10470333	That's about it, personally.
10471193	10472934	So, I guess that's about it.
10472954	10474675	We've got only a few minutes left in the show.
10474815	10476976	Let's go around and get everybody's final... Where's Dave?
10476996	10477437	Get Dave in here.
10477457	10478497	We've got to get his final thought.
10482518	10485641	What did he pass?
10485921	10487903	He says he passed Presto, yay.
10488484	10489645	Hey, that's impressive.
10489985	10493628	Okay, so let's talk about everybody's final thought for today.
10494269	10495130	Jamie, your final thought.
10495150	10495630	I'll go final.
10496491	10496731	What?
10496751	10497552	I'll go final.
10497872	10498433	You'll go final.
10499373	10500274	Loki, your final thought.
10502196	10506719	Definitely be watching the Fry's ads because they've been having a lot of good stuff really cheap lately.
10506819	10516847	I mean, you can't beat... If I didn't want to stick with the name brand Yamaha, I could have gone with the verbatim CD-R burner for $19, a 40-speed CD burner.
10517007	10518188	Let's just put it this way.
10518208	10521150	40-speed... I put my shoes on today while I was burning a CD.
10521210	10524873	The CD burner finished burning my CD before my shoes were on.
10525433	10527615	I mean, that's just crazy shit right there.
10528195	10530357	So, definitely check that stuff out.
10530457	10531818	Watch my site later this week.
10531878	10534581	There should be some updates, I hope, if I get around to it.
10534841	10535602	I've been kind of busy.
10536222	10537984	And, yeah, that kind of shit.
10538164	10539065	So, watch that.
10539185	10542187	Look for TourneyMix because you're going to have a lot of cool files to download there.
10542267	10544650	And, yeah, just that kind of stuff.
10544690	10545110	Have fun.
10547252	10548573	Black Lab, your final thought for today?
10550034	10550795	Let me think.
10551636	10551776	Um...
10553092	10556253	I have a paper due tomorrow morning that I need to finish when I get home.
10556473	10556954	Slacker.
10558054	10558874	Yeah, I'm right, I am.
10560215	10561355	And, uh, let's see.
10561836	10567778	The next time Twin says Mac suck, I'm gonna go down to Florida and take one of those puck mice from the early IMAX and shove it up his ass.
10569639	10571599	We don't wanna go to that area.
10572020	10574381	I don't wanna know about things going up Twin's ass.
10576421	10578662	Hey, I mean, uh, I don't know.
10579102	10579343	Mac?
10579363	10579903	Rob!
10580783	10582624	I'm not done with my final thought yet, dammit.
10584112	10584453	Damn it.
10586635	10588176	Damn it, you made me forget what I was going to say.
10589677	10590358	Wrong text.
10592320	10592720	Whatever.
10593961	10594942	Yeah, I had fun tonight.
10595583	10595963	Go meet.
10597365	10597565	No.
10598706	10599546	No, Loki, you're done.
10602089	10602709	I'll let him talk.
10602830	10603150	Loki.
10604897	10613179	Expect some more Guitar Freak's 7th and 8th music and also popping music stuff to be appearing in our playlist later this week.
10613579	10613899	Check it out.
10614099	10614299	Yes.
10615080	10621161	We actually already have some 8th and 7th in there, but popping music, per that email, we finally, we ordered our albums and we got them.
10621701	10622181	Wink wink.
10622742	10625762	So we'll be adding the popping music stuff like we promised we would this week.
10626402	10630123	And the Paula Tanberry's, the Paula Terry band is over now.
10630143	10631424	No, no it's not.
10631624	10632684	Oh, we're going to ban her for another week?
10633564	10634324	Banner for a month.
10635144	10636185	We'll banner until next year.
10636425	10638906	Alright, so Politary's banned for the rest of the year.
10641866	10647588	And my final thought is, I still need a date, but it looks like I might have one this week, so that's cool.
10649129	10650229	Shut up.
10650789	10653070	And I guess that's it.
10653170	10654910	I need to go play DDR because I'm getting fat.
10655230	10657431	And I don't like being fat.
10658251	10658571	That's it.
10659052	10659432	My turn.
10659532	10660412	Jamie, your final thought.
10663175	10663595	That's it.
10663856	10664316	That's it?
10664356	10669640	That's your final thought?
10669740	10671080	I guess Dave doesn't have a final thought.
10671141	10671681	Dave loses.
10671961	10673642	Dave doesn't have a single thought in his head.
10673682	10674763	Dave doesn't have a thought in his head.
10677385	10677985	Dave's final thought.
10678025	10678846	Oh yeah, Dave and Presto.
10678866	10679546	That was his final thought.
10679566	10682448	So what did you guys think of... Oh god.
10683129	10683829	Here he comes.
10685630	10686511	I passed Presto.
10686711	10687752	Yay.
10687832	10688832	I already said that.
10688892	10689373	Get out of here.
10689393	10691114	You're banned with Politary.
10692634	10694695	We're locking Impolitary in the closet.
10695296	10695556	What?
10696417	10698838	You and Impolitary are getting locked in the closet.
10699038	10704562	Coming next week... Coming next week is Impolitary Upskirt Cam.
10704882	10705442	Exclusive.
10705462	10705502	Oh.
10707464	10712347	Dear Diary, I went to open my closet and there was Impolitary with an underage American.
10712927	10716370	What was that cracker boy doing in my closet, you might ask?
10716890	10719812	Well, that will be in my next week's diary.
10720112	10721353	So what did you guys think of the three hour show?
10721894	10723455	That three hour trainwreck.
10725175	10728196	I was very disappointed there was no Gilligan's Island music in the intro.
10729697	10731277	I thought about it, but that's so cliche.
10731717	10734258	I promoted it as a three hour tour, so that was about it.
10734979	10735919	What did you think of three hours?
10738020	10740280	It's a hell of a lot better when you're actually in here.
10741861	10742121	Yeah.
10742801	10749664	And even though it's kind of a small room, it's a hell of a lot better sitting down on my computer and my ass getting numb from not moving.
10751549	10757791	It would have been better if we had a lot more Belmani news going on, but since everyone is kind of like, eh, nope.
10758192	10760893	Maybe we'll get out and do some interviews this week, so we'll have something to talk about next week.
10760913	10762493	We need to take care of the interviews from Shaft.
10762733	10764294	Yes, we're going to try and get that at some point.
10765935	10769436	I am very scared of the best of tape that you're going to put together here.
10769516	10770936	Coming soon, coming soon.
10771016	10771637	Do your worst.
10773314	10774775	And next week we need three microphones.
10774935	10775756	Just thought I'd mention that.
10775796	10776616	We'll see what we can do.
10778058	10779098	And another chair.
10780259	10781080	We'll see what we can do.
10781100	10782141	Oh, and the phone.
10782581	10784202	The magic phone box, too.
10784242	10785063	We can't do that.
10785263	10786123	We'll see what we can do.
10786364	10788825	Alright, thanks for listening, everybody.
10788845	10789906	We appreciate your support.
10789946	10790647	Stay tuned.
10790747	10793169	More Monty music to come after this very show.
10793189	10796171	And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
10797461	10800101	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10800141	10801322	Fuck, fuck, fuck, mother motherfucker.
10827714	10840865	Fuck, noice, noice, noice One, two, one, two, three, four Noice, noice, noice Smokin' weed, smokin' weirs Doin' coke, drinkin' beers Drinkin' beers, beers, beers Rollin' baddies, smokin' blunts Who smokes the blunts?
10841125	10841846	Who smoked the blunts?

10855078	10858735	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
