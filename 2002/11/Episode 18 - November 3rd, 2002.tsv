8520	9360	It's a videotape!
9740	10181	Put it in!
10201	10641	Put it in!
13522	16382	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.
16442	17923	Our live talk program begins now.
17963	18423	Boring!
18443	19223	This video sucks!
34489	37913	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
37953	41156	Orange Lounge may contain nudity.
41737	45081	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
45501	48725	Hide Orange Lounge radio from the fucking children.
49505	52248	The last Metroid is in captivity.
53390	55452	The galaxy is at peace.
68470	71774	I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.
72254	75098	My kind of people, and assholes.
75838	76219	One.
77941	78501	One.
79803	80504	He's good.
80944	82486	Mischief by that much.
82846	84308	That's Dr. Evil's cat.
84628	85269	How can you tell?
85569	86711	I never forget a pussy.
87555	89617	I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
114013	132005	DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 18 for November the 3rd of 2002.
133506	142312	That's funny, during the intro in here, if you sit in the studio, when it comes to that part where it goes, My girlfriend's got 37 dicks, everybody in the room all at once goes, Try not to suck any dick on the way to the parking lot.
142512	142732	Anyway...
143706	148007	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most wonderful radio station of all things Bomani.
148167	150388	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
150888	155189	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
155369	156729	You know her better as DarkSakura.
157669	159630	Say hello as well to our newest co-host.
159830	161450	Well, not really, because he's been here since the beginning.
161490	162530	It's our sim god, Loki.
162970	163590	Hello, everybody.
164491	168051	And with us tonight in studio is always our most special guest in the world.
168111	169032	Say hello to Dave.
169052	170212	He's our pet brownie.
172027	174928	Dave brought us brownies tonight.
176288	177829	People are buying us crap tonight.
177869	179629	We're getting pizza from Loki.
179849	181430	We got spongy brownies from Dave.
182810	184470	Does life get any better than this?
184551	185391	Yeah, I have Propella.
185411	185971	Life is good.
187311	189532	Except that stupid fly needs to get the hell out of here.
190832	192333	I know a lady who swallowed a fly.
193173	194333	I don't know why she swallowed a fly.
195033	197834	Loki's doing this whole karate kid thing here, trying to catch the fly.
199198	204646	For our listeners, a fly has made it into the studio and it's going to die sometime during the duration of the show.
206816	208937	All right, we'll be talking to everybody more a little bit later.
209017	215178	First, we're going to take an opening break, and we're going to play a bunch of stuff from Max USA, because that is the big news this week.
215238	218358	DDR Max USA finally hits shelves this week.
218779	225100	Lots of surprises in there, including a lot of really great new tunes, and we're going to play some of those for you right now.
226740	234702	Here we go on Orange Lounge Radio, a whole block of Max USA songs, and we'll be right back to talk about Max USA.
329651	331475	It's a long way to go, honey.
332498	332838	I know.
333881	334943	But I'm afraid.
334983	336065	Where are we going?
336186	339333	Into the dark, black forest.
419987	422510	We interrupt this music for a special announcement.
423010	424372	Loki has killed the fly.
427476	428517	He has dropped the bomb.
449756	466273	The Closest Diner, what it takes is a service call, we make a few mistakes, what we gotta do is so momentum, if we need the right tools and best, it's right the way, it's not copy the rhythm of the market, it's just we gotta get with it, the rain is setting on my car, you can do it now, you're not the mango collar, yes I already hate that ball, I'm using it to call the rock and ball, yeah, rock and ball, rock and ball.
529089	530670	Thanks for watching!
607802	612204	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.
615525	621148	Watch all your favorite monster hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki, engage in the Bomani Battle Royale.
621428	623709	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, at 7 p.m.
623729	627290	Pacific Time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.
627610	630251	May I be suitable for children under six, pregnant women, retards, and residents of all.
630632	631532	Are you ready?
632532	633953	Ready for the race, are you?
635512	640454	You're already listening to Orange Lounge Live Radio, but I hadn't played that promo yet during the live show, so I thought I would.
640474	642494	What do six-year-olds and retards have to do with it?
645155	646415	I just decided I'd be random.
646435	649616	And if you listen very carefully, it also says residents of Baltimore.
650096	655878	And we're picking on Baltimore because when I pulled up the stats for what cities listen to us the most, Baltimore was in last place.
656198	658059	So we're picking on them.
659559	663280	Which is a bummer because Baltimore is where all the John Waters films are set.
663320	665121	And if you know me, I love John Waters, so...
666783	670448	Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the Max USA crap that we just played for you.
671290	674174	It wasn't crap, it was more like diarrhea.
674234	677980	Max USA just came out this week and we're all happy happy.
678780	680521	It was really special.
682521	686503	I noticed we have a lot of new people listening tonight, so I thought I'd point out some things for you.
686523	690885	If you want to join our chat room, just go to any Other Side IRC server.
691045	698187	You're going to just put in your server as irc.eggheads.org, or you're going to put in karma.othersideirc.net, either one of those.
698527	703189	That's where all the big Mamani chat rooms are, and you're just going to join Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.
703229	704610	That's where the cool kids hang out.
704630	705090	That's right.
705850	707952	If you're too lazy to get on IRC, that's cool.
707992	712835	We're making an effort to keep our Yahoo box online while we're doing the show.
712855	713916	So you can just shoot us an email.
713936	715097	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
715117	715817	That's all one word.
716257	719339	OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and we'll check that box throughout the show.
719519	720880	That's for all the cool kids in the email.
721641	721881	Thank you.
721901	723042	You want to be a cool kid, don't you?
724372	734940	While we're talking about, you know, station news and events, as you noticed in the beginning of the show, we have decided to make Loki an official co-host now.
735100	736561	May as well, he's here all the time.
737002	742366	You know, this guy shows up, he sits over here, he gives commentary, we give him a segment.
742746	743847	We don't even let him sit in a chair.
745158	745899	Here, ask it over.
746520	747100	God damn it!
747340	750924	Just like last week, there's people outside the studio here fucking honking at the neighbors.
750944	751705	We don't care!
753086	756289	Shut up!
756550	757250	Where's my gun?
757270	759132	Boom!
759292	762616	Anyway, now... This is my boomstick!
763497	766279	Now that... God damn!
766359	768221	Somebody fell asleep on the horn out there.
768281	768582	Excuse me.
771260	777583	We realize that your horn works, but we don't need to hear it.
778823	781824	Yes, I'm very happy to be the... Oh yeah, speech, speech, speech, speech.
782244	782465	Yes.
783085	784245	Thank you for all the little people.
784765	785826	All the little people that support me.
788539	790381	Is it just me or did the horn get quieter?
790541	791242	Like it died.
792443	793404	Like it was a pathetic horn.
793424	794725	I put a fear of DS into them.
795226	795886	Where's my bat?
796967	797287	Okay.
798409	798829	No, no, no.
798909	800250	I have neighbors, Jamie.
800290	800811	I have neighbors.
803954	805255	That horn gets a fuck you.
806576	807797	We'll do the fuck you's of the week a bit later.
809179	809799	No, it stopped.
809919	810300	It stopped.
810720	811141	There you go.
811181	811781	Everything's fine now.
811921	812462	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
815151	815651	There we go.
816011	817272	See, Jamie can be polite, too.
817953	818413	Yeah.
819273	820134	I'm sorry, did you have anything else?
820154	821455	I could have said, thank you, bitches.
821835	822515	Okay, fuck them.
823756	824576	They started up again.
824916	829679	I wish we had a microphone outside, but we don't, so the whole listening public out there is going, what the hell are they talking about?
832060	833401	Live on the horn, Mike.
837123	838304	Jamie finally shut the window.
839315	846139	Yes, right now I'm having Dave play my DDR Max save game so he can beat my Onis.
846159	847640	Because you suck at the Oni.
847780	848220	I suck.
848300	849561	I hate Onis, okay?
849701	855524	I incredibly hate Onis, and when I found out that you have to play the Oni courses to unlock songs, that really pissed me off.
855904	862308	Well, you don't have to, but if you want to get them like this month... I unlocked a song by failing one.
863088	863689	Now that's cool.
863709	868655	That's something, that was the first thing that made me think, gosh, this game really is for Americans.
869055	870998	That you get unlocks by failing things.
871058	872379	It's like, good effort.
873520	876404	Just got Gradius Cyber today, yay.
878486	879888	That song was Zinkonomics.
881129	883312	I love getting unlocks from games I already own.
887024	889205	That's my one bitch about Max USA.
889245	892706	I mean, don't get me wrong, great game, pretty kick-ass.
893526	895226	One of the best home releases they've done yet.
895286	898327	I really haven't decided if I like Fifth Mix more or if I like this one more.
898387	899168	But, I mean, it's good.
899228	904289	It's definitely, by far, better than either of the other two games we've got so far in the U.S.
904329	904809	That's for sure.
904829	907710	It would have been cool if they had a databank with saved edits.
907750	910971	That's what makes Fifth stand out for me, in my opinion.
911431	921782	The only problem is they would be all Konomics or DDR USA edits, which would be totally pointless because, I mean, you can't play them on the arcade machine, so that kind of sucks.
922728	922948	Yeah.
923508	926289	But, um, I don't know, it's pretty good so far.
926349	927750	I mean, Oni courses are alright.
928030	928950	I just don't like them.
929250	930511	Playing them off heads sucks.
930651	931992	You just like being able to see them.
932052	933912	Like, if I wanted to play Oni, I could.
934072	934713	Yeah, exactly.
934813	935933	I want them to be there.
936053	941295	Maybe have, like, one song unlocked with an Oni instead of, like, you know, the two last songs.
943496	944976	The songs you want most of all.
945257	946197	Yeah, exactly.
946557	948658	I mean, I can't possibly, you know...
949980	953427	Steal the steps and put them in sim files if, you know, I can't play them.
953548	954009	Now can I?
955635	960637	Speaking of which, you want to give a plug for your big contribution to the scene this week?
960837	971341	Yeah, well, I would say I was helping NMR and those people, the crew of people that were supposedly making Max USA sim files.
971941	977883	This crew seemed to have pulled out two files, while myself, in like two days, pulled out 11 files.
978063	979163	Didn't we time you last night?
979203	983785	It took you about a half hour to get out, you leave me alone, like all six difficulties, single and double?
983965	986145	Yeah, singles and doubles, it took me 34 minutes.
986606	986866	Nice.
987606	990126	I think I went to bed before you finished, but... Yeah, it was fun.
990626	993547	I also finished last night, you know, the other five.
994287	1000468	So, everything's up except for Drop the Bomb, System FX, FX Mix, and... System SF.
1001088	1001708	SF, yes.
1002489	1003229	Like San Francisco.
1003729	1003949	Yes.
1004509	1009430	System San Francisco Mix, and the... Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
1012193	1016356	and the Do It Right two-step harmonized mix or whatever the hell that is.
1016376	1017297	I don't even know what it's called.
1017317	1018898	The decent version of Do It Right, basically.
1018958	1019479	I guess.
1019619	1020299	Yeah, whatever.
1021720	1022341	You like the original?
1022361	1023142	I like the original.
1023162	1023222	Why?
1023262	1024202	I'm a fan of the original.
1024823	1026424	I like the bass in it better.
1027925	1028486	I really do.
1028566	1029366	Alright, fair enough.
1029567	1030387	I'm entitled to.
1030427	1031688	So deal with it.
1031708	1033409	You can like whatever you want, Jamie.
1033429	1033910	That's fine.
1034310	1035091	Except let them move.
1035131	1036852	No one's allowed to like that song except Gwen.
1036892	1040155	Because I say so.
1041030	1041430	All right.
1042291	1042851	I'm the chick.
1043472	1043792	Thank you.
1043832	1044632	Because you're the chick.
1044652	1045813	Look, the horn drove off.
1047034	1048315	What are you looking at, Loki?
1048435	1051817	Loki's... The fly is still... Oh, he's looking to see if the pizza guy's here.
1051837	1056880	But the fly, by the way, which we left twitching on the windowsill, has managed to slide off and is stuck to the edge of it.
1057700	1058981	Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
1059001	1062523	We have prop... Now the fly is actually dead.
1062563	1064665	There was the fly's last moment on this earth.
1065285	1066366	See you in hell, fly.
1066386	1068607	The fly is now splattered against a propel bottle.
1068667	1069508	Dave's back in the room.
1069648	1069928	Hi, Dave.
1070441	1071961	What do you want to say about Max USA, Dave?
1072381	1073282	That's really good.
1074362	1075742	Dark Black Forest is really cool.
1075842	1076482	That's right.
1076542	1078043	That's what I do like about Max USA.
1078063	1079263	This is what they did right.
1079803	1081244	They didn't just do it right.
1081284	1083024	They did it fucking better than right.
1083444	1086625	The licensed USA tracks fucking rule.
1087065	1089645	Dark Black Forest is one of the best Bomani songs ever.
1090106	1091746	And I will cut you if you think any different.
1092326	1096808	and You Leave Me Alone is something, it sounds like it's right off like a Dance Mania album, but better.
1097168	1101570	I mean, I don't know who thought to license those songs, because I certainly never heard them before, Max USA.
1101890	1103511	I don't know anybody that did know those songs.
1104031	1109113	Loki, you said you thought you'd heard Dark Black Forest before, or somebody on this show said they heard that before.
1109153	1109433	I don't know.
1109453	1110454	No, I'd never heard it before.
1111234	1111814	They announced it.
1112115	1113595	It's a very hard song to find.
1113855	1119598	I'm very concerned because the trucker there looks like a guy walked out with a bag of something and went to that other house.
1120618	1123079	That's probably cocaine, don't worry about it.
1124760	1130523	But I swear, that's the one thing they did right, was those license tracks, Rule, I don't know who thought to pick those.
1130824	1133885	They were cool, except for I Like To Move It, which that song sucks!
1134205	1135526	God, I hate that song!
1136086	1137867	I Like To Move It, reel to reel.
1137927	1142590	I would like to say that that Move It song, yeah.
1143945	1148207	No, I just want to say that they could have done better on making the songs harder, though.
1148247	1150749	Like Sandstorm, I wanted it to be hard.
1151209	1155171	It's just like Freeze Arrows, they went overboard on the Freeze Arrows way too much.
1155211	1162595	Okay, if SCK was here right now, which he's not, so he can't bitch at us whenever we make fun of Max USA, he'd say, that's what edit mode's for.
1163857	1166699	Yeah, I know, but they went way overboard on the freeze era.
1166719	1168440	They're like, hey, we've got a new mode that we can use.
1168460	1169120	Let me make you steps.
1169680	1170601	Let me make you steps.
1170921	1171181	Yeah.
1172042	1175643	Sandstorm is a cool song, but they made shitty-ass steps for it.
1175684	1178405	They needed to do the do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
1178565	1182627	Instead, they were like, freeze, freeze, note, note, note, freeze.
1182647	1184809	Well, the thing I was disappointed in is there's no new katas.
1185509	1185929	None at all.
1186029	1190692	Yeah, that was kind of weird that there's no new katas, but I guess, you know, that's to be gentle to us, you know, stupid Americans.
1193190	1193870	God damn it.
1194350	1195711	It's the fucking horn again.
1197131	1199552	And I beat the adrenaline honey for Loki.
1199732	1200092	Pizza.
1201272	1202512	Maybe it's the pizza guy honking.
1203112	1203412	I don't know.
1203432	1204193	Loki ran to get his pizza.
1204213	1205973	Then we'll get our pizza and then shoot him.
1206493	1207734	We'll get our pizza and throw it.
1207774	1209114	We'll pull a Braveheart on him.
1209134	1212135	We'll throw artichoke hearts at the... I'm going to eat those.
1212815	1220837	What do you think about the old... What do you think about getting old Dance Mania tracks and tracks that were licensed for Japan and getting some of those on USA?
1221197	1221797	I must admit...
1222977	1227358	I thought it was fucking cool that Captain Jack was on Max USA.
1227458	1229839	That was the coolest thing ever.
1230379	1230919	Captain Jack.
1231279	1236181	I was feeling really crappy when I started playing my game, so I only thumb-bumped it and didn't get very far into it.
1236221	1241362	But, you know, Brilliant to You, Orchestra Groove was on there, so that made me instantly a happy bunny.
1241922	1248644	And me being the only person who likes to love that feeling, I was ecstatic to have that song in the game.
1250425	1250625	What?
1250985	1251185	What?
1251205	1251705	Uh-oh.
1252662	1254224	Dave has just unlocked it, right?
1254304	1255205	Two-step harmonized.
1255345	1255886	How'd he do it?
1256386	1257948	He beat the adrenaline, Oni.
1257988	1258429	Did he really?
1258449	1258949	So guess what?
1258989	1262333	You're going to see a sim file for that on my site tonight.
1262433	1263495	Alright.
1263535	1263815	Cool.
1264676	1265677	You heard it here first, I guess.
1265697	1268020	Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy.
1269141	1277109	Did you notice the interesting use of some of the recycled videos, like how Love This Feelin' has the Let's Groove video in it?
1277330	1279072	I don't know if you looked into it that much.
1279132	1280353	I was just happy it was there.
1281694	1289783	Dan was there, and I didn't want to torture him with the multi-genre, multi-tempo song, even though I like it.
1290043	1294445	Twin says he loves Love This Feelin', and he made me play it on Wednesday's little thing, which is true.
1294465	1296826	I don't know what to think about that, because he also likes Let Them Move.
1299187	1303949	No, I actually, you know, you've got good taste, thank you.
1304169	1308692	If you were missing it, this is one of the reasons why you want to listen to Orange Lounge, you know, throughout the week as well.
1309172	1318336	On Wednesday night, when we picked up the game, I came in here and had this elaborate setup in here, and unfortunately, Jamie was at home playing it herself, and Loki wasn't here.
1318536	1319757	Jamie was at home sick.
1320117	1322159	Jamie was at home sick and playing it for yourself.
1322219	1327362	But I just got on the stream, fired up the Orange Lounge stream, and just started playing it on air and playing all the new tracks and stuff.
1327402	1330865	So if you listen during the week, sometimes you get little surprises like that.
1330925	1332926	So listen to Orange Lounge all the time.
1333166	1339651	I would still like to say that I'm still having an open commission, I guess, for someone to make me Dynamite R5.
1340963	1342744	Remember that JB made you that one.
1342764	1347046	I mean... In the way that you imagined it in your head.
1347206	1349007	A professionally styled mixed one.
1349387	1350327	You didn't like JB's version?
1350367	1352088	It was special.
1352228	1352848	Thank you, JB.
1353648	1354389	It was special.
1355629	1357430	But it's not quite the way I envisioned it to be.
1357450	1358991	Did we actually play that on a show?
1359011	1359691	No.
1359951	1361372	Oh, then maybe we ought to play that later.
1361572	1361872	I don't know.
1362372	1363453	I don't even know if I still have it.
1363513	1363933	Hopefully I do.
1363993	1364293	We'll see.
1365774	1366654	You made JB cry.
1368295	1369115	No, I didn't cry.
1371053	1377657	Oh, no, I, look, it was good, but it's not how I envisioned it.
1378357	1380078	I guess you'd have to sort of read my mind.
1380138	1381399	Okay, new one.
1381879	1382120	Okay.
1382320	1382680	New one.
1382820	1383420	Okay, a new one.
1385762	1387323	What's a good one that will work?
1387483	1391045	How about mixing Holic.
1391325	1391765	Holic.
1392906	1394227	With...
1395979	1396999	Stoic.
1397759	1399180	No, not stoic.
1400560	1406442	Missholic with, Mixholic with, um, um, um, um, um, Gentle Stress.
1406862	1409942	Holic doesn't really mix, though, because it's, uh, different measures.
1410282	1411283	It's on seven.
1411303	1412163	Two, it's seven, eight.
1413163	1414904	Okay, Era with Gentle Stress.
1415064	1415304	All right.
1416204	1417204	Gentle Era.
1418624	1420345	The Era-sensual mix.
1422655	1428359	If someone can make me a good mix of era and gentle stress, I'll give you a dollar.
1428499	1432741	Because we can't use the word sexual in a game, we have to use sensual.
1433602	1436664	That pisses me off, because that's why they can't license any erotic songs.
1437524	1440726	I remember saying on DDR Freak a while back, why not just call him exotic?
1441967	1445349	And I think somebody ran with that, I've heard that used again lately, but you know.
1447225	1447725	It's all good.
1448246	1452489	I really would want to see something like Kiss Me or Temple of Love in DDR.
1452529	1453309	It would be rad.
1453389	1455711	Well, we've already seen those songs in DDR.
1455731	1464757	A year and a half before I had even heard of DDR, there was a song that my friend sent me called Don't Talk Dirty, which was the very first erotic song I ever heard.
1465277	1467319	And I would like that to be in DDR.
1467359	1468139	That song owns.
1468199	1468980	Maybe I'll play that later.
1469360	1469760	We have it.
1469861	1470321	I do have it.
1470541	1471782	That would make me a happy bunny.
1472122	1497974	I need to put Lollipop in DDR Lollipop, Lollipop No, not that No, the DJ Alligator Project Lollipop Suck on my lollipop, I wanna lick it Last week on Orange Lounge Hunters I'll bring that song, it's awesome Black Lab has announced he'd like to see Dr. Dick in DDR Help me, Dr. Dick
1498948	1500513	Max, don't have sex with your ex.
1501035	1503383	Hey, they have the 2003 one or 2002 version of that.
1505287	1508548	Yeah, on the new Dance Mania Red, or not Red, uh, EX.
1508849	1509829	Dance Mania EX one.
1511010	1515131	Oh, Dance Mania Extreme!
1515191	1520134	I still fear that, you know, I hope what Dan said doesn't come to pass for DDR.
1520194	1520574	What's that?
1521014	1527537	You know, once they release a series of games, then add Extreme to the end of the most recent release, that means the series is about to die.
1528137	1530778	But if it's coming, it's gotta be the final.
1531479	1531659	Right?
1533007	1541651	Yeah, it had to be like, you know, DDR extreme, super duper extreme, fun, dance party, final mix, too.
1542231	1545492	Or something like that, I don't know.
1545532	1548073	You know, DDR happy crack mix, and have it all happy hardcore.
1548314	1548754	Bye!
1550421	1551562	Let's play some Tetris, motherfucker
1577580	1581762	Well, could that mean that they're going to be starting over with some new kind of dance game?
1582602	1584663	Oh my God's 8-panel DDR or something?
1585404	1586624	DDR 2DX?
1587185	1587405	No.
1588245	1589526	No, then we'd have Technomotion.
1592367	1592787	Exactly.
1595069	1596469	So, is the pizza here?
1597410	1598070	Oh, no, it wasn't.
1598110	1598950	Oh, that was a false alarm.
1599611	1600231	I'm sorry to hear that.
1600551	1601772	Dick with the horn.
1602532	1602972	That sucks.
1603052	1604033	Okay, Dick with the horn.
1605293	1606234	He hasn't honked in a while, though.
1606892	1611616	Yeah, but if he does it next week, I swear I'm going to go over there and cut off his hands.
1613418	1615479	And then if he uses his head, I'll just cut that off too.
1615900	1616800	And then we'll make him eat it.
1617161	1617381	Wait.
1618742	1620584	Oh, we hear a yes from the other room.
1620904	1624547	Oh, I wonder what Dave got.
1624847	1625948	Dave might unlock something else.
1626128	1626489	We'll see.
1629011	1630312	Any other thoughts you have on Max Rosen?
1631011	1631592	It's pretty.
1632432	1644640	And by the way, I have to give a big pile, you know, a big six-bar box of kudos to Jason Enos for those funny little blurbs whenever you unlock a song.
1660891	1662913	Yeah, whenever you play a song.
1663834	1668218	Well, some it works with the unlocks, but I think that it's mainly when you actually play the song.
1669511	1670452	I have to read one of them.
1670492	1671792	It was so hilarious.
1671812	1672713	Let's see if I can find it.
1675234	1676315	Yes, I do have it.
1676335	1676935	We have one.
1677095	1679597	Okay, this is for when you unlock So In Love.
1679637	1687661	It says, You have unlocked the song So In Love by Caramel S, oozing with stories of love just like melted caramel over a hot flame.
1688001	1693924	This down-tempo song has elements of 70s pop, smooth jazz, and lounge all rolled into every bite.
1694325	1694585	Yum!
1695685	1696706	That is so cool.
1696726	1697946	That was my favorite.
1698246	1699366	Just that they have yum.
1700367	1701267	That was so cool.
1701787	1703228	Three little letters add so much.
1703628	1704148	They really do.
1705128	1706149	Is there another one I have here?
1706589	1708930	Oh yes, this is another one that's very popular.
1708950	1711050	I think this is already posted on some message boards.
1711591	1713771	You have failed game mode for the first time.
1714231	1717593	As a result, you have unlocked the song Celebrate by JJ Company.
1718133	1718753	Celebrate.
1719053	1724115	Now you can celebrate your first failure in style, but don't give up on your dream to be the ultimate dancer.
1727359	1731222	Which, by the way, is one of the most god-awful songs I've ever heard in DDR.
1731362	1732543	Celebrate!
1732843	1733904	Celebrate!
1733964	1734464	What's that?
1735445	1738426	Oh, this is information mode when you... Oh, anyways.
1738446	1739447	Maybe we'll play that later, too.
1740468	1742189	Maybe I'll play Celebrate just to torture everybody.
1742209	1746031	No, he just beat Candy on quarter stage, so I unlocked Candy.
1746372	1746792	Ah, cool.
1746912	1749574	Now he's playing home base, the Oni, the 17 song Oni.
1750995	1752055	What do you get when you beat that, though?
1752095	1752776	Don't you get a...
1756281	1758863	Oh, that's, um... Is there anything else you haven't unlocked yet?
1758883	1759323	Spin the Disc.
1759623	1760824	Oh, Spin the Disc, that's a good one.
1760844	1762945	That's Spin the Disc, and the last one's Drop the Bomb.
1763045	1764426	I hope it's Drop the Bomb, you never know.
1764806	1766307	Drop the Bomb is in this one.
1766907	1769048	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed online.
1769068	1771810	You have to beat the 21 song order to get it.
1772050	1779274	I mean, it starts off with a three-footer, and the highest thing is, uh... The hardest song in there is gonna be Midnight Blaze, Maniac.
1779474	1781696	That's it.
1782076	1785118	Tal says that failing an Oni gets you gentle stress.
1786059	1786620	And that's true.
1786700	1795086	There was a really funny information that says, like, Oni mode can be so stressful, but, you know, smooth out with a sensual song.
1795427	1800811	Yeah, I remember that one because, of course, I failed my Oni on the first song because I don't like Onis.
1802392	1802912	That's okay.
1804213	1805294	The ferret hates them, too.
1807196	1807356	Arrgh.
1807376	1808237	Arrgh.
1810780	1814961	So, anything that you wish you would have seen on Max USA that didn't end up making it?
1816481	1816961	Nemesis?
1818061	1819141	Yeah, what happened to those songs?
1819181	1823542	I remember on an early list, we had Nemesis, we had a remix of Superstar, didn't we?
1823562	1828623	I am not at all unhappy that the Superstar remix is not there.
1828663	1829683	I know you hate that remix.
1829923	1832364	What's the one, the M2 step from Six Style?
1832384	1834284	There was an M2 step, I believe that was supposed to be in there too.
1834304	1835064	I wonder what happened to those.
1835924	1837605	Also, I think More Deep was on there too.
1838545	1839305	Maybe, I don't remember.
1840653	1842574	Um, let's see what else was supposed to be on there.
1842874	1843234	I don't know.
1843774	1852038	My guess, if anything, since, you know, they probably did have some data for those, Max too, that's all.
1853137	1853857	I think it'll be interesting.
1853897	1858059	Maybe somebody can go into the disc and see if they can find images for Nemesis and things like that.
1858339	1860500	I'm surprised nobody's thought to go in and see if those are in there.
1860620	1862761	I'm sure people have thought about it.
1862942	1864282	Actually, they're working on it right now.
1864522	1870705	There's a guy that I talked to on DDR Maniacs that was doing, like, hex editing on there.
1870725	1874087	He was, like, a cracker at one time, so he's, you know... Cracker!
1874967	1876728	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1878366	1884872	No, he's supposed to be going in there to rip the high quality backgrounds and stuff and the videos.
1885152	1886654	So, we'll see that.
1887895	1889076	That would be cool if they could find that stuff.
1889096	1893660	Because didn't somebody go into USA Mix and actually found a bad girl's background without the gun?
1894020	1894581	Things like that.
1894761	1904364	There's also, with the aid of GameShark with Konomics, they found modes that were in the fourth mix.
1904384	1906765	Well, because they basically ripped a fourth mix, right?
1906825	1909146	Yeah, but they found all of the challenge mode and things like that.
1910146	1912707	I was kind of sad that Challenge Mode didn't make it into Max.
1912787	1914027	Challenge Mode was evil.
1914087	1916848	I guess that's what they kind of called Oni Mode.
1917088	1918469	That was always fun.
1918489	1919369	This is a challenging mode.
1919429	1920149	I just love the picture.
1920349	1921390	I'm not going to cry about it.
1922370	1925731	And remember, there's STDs in DDR Max.
1925931	1931236	Did you notice though that when you're actually playing the game that it still has the little characters, the Asian ones?
1931296	1931556	Yeah.
1931837	1932637	Crazy, huh?
1932918	1933178	Yeah.
1934179	1935400	It's like, whoops, somebody got lazy.
1935440	1937582	And also on the high score screens it says DDR6.
1939724	1945049	Yeah, but it's kind of so subtle because it kind of goes with the whole little theme, the modernization theme they had going with that.
1945569	1946590	You don't really notice it.
1946630	1947371	Yeah, it's still cool.
1947851	1948412	Don't get us wrong.
1949269	1954032	I'm just glad that, you know, they would have had to put it on a DVD for as much crap as they put in there.
1954072	1954332	They did.
1954732	1955072	It is on DVD.
1955092	1956333	And I mean crap in a positive sense.
1956453	1957394	You know, it was nice crap.
1959195	1962396	You know, it fertilizes your, you know, music addiction.
1963677	1972442	The only other thing, the thing that kind of also disappointed me about Max USA is that the box, the back of the box says something like it links up with Konomics for special stuff.
1972962	1977905	And basically what it means, and when you read it in the manual, you can load your edits from Konomics.
1978205	1978285	Ooh.
1978565	1979326	Thanks for watching!
1997635	1999077	You could, but they just wouldn't show up.
2000278	2007346	The thing I was kind of laughing at the whole time while playing DDR Max was how much they're advertising for Konomics.
2007806	2010629	In the information screen, it's like, Go buy!
2011130	2012011	Go buy Konomics!
2012251	2012692	Go buy it!
2013012	2013312	Come on!
2013673	2013853	Go!
2014193	2014313	Go!
2015494	2018876	Well, Konomics is probably down to $19.99 by now, right?
2018957	2020478	I think most of the PS1 games are.
2020498	2024100	At last check, Konomics was at $29.99 at GameStop.
2024280	2027562	I would imagine eventually it'll probably go down to $19.99 though, right?
2027722	2029223	As most of the PS1 games probably will.
2029243	2031124	Eventually, but it still sells.
2031725	2032585	Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.
2033746	2034466	No question about it.
2034927	2039570	And if you're hooking new people onto DDR, I suppose why not let them know that Konomics is out there?
2039930	2044173	Of course, they didn't try to sell any copies of USA Mix, but that's okay because USA Mix was kind of crappy.
2045054	2051182	It was better than I would have expected for a first release.
2053265	2056629	Because, if you keep in mind, they were testing the waters.
2058331	2060915	From what I understand, Konami had little faith.
2061653	2064514	The DDR was going to be that big as it is now.
2064794	2068055	And you've noticed each release has been progressively better.
2068075	2071777	So now we have exactly just about the same copy.
2071817	2074137	We have a better one that was released in Japan.
2074357	2077438	I agree to an extent about the first mix.
2077539	2084421	I think they kind of should have already known from success in the arcades, from rabid followings such as DDR Freak, things like that.
2084901	2087364	The fact that import machines are more popular than the U.S.
2087404	2090789	machines, I kind of would have expected a little bit more faith.
2090809	2092211	But they really didn't have that much.
2093552	2094654	That's the fact of the matter.
2094694	2095154	They didn't.
2095335	2096336	It took convincing.
2096356	2098779	But we have it now.
2100129	2105493	Disney Mix, on the other hand, was an improvement over the Japanese one, I thought.
2105673	2106773	I don't think so.
2106974	2111536	It was missing some of the good songs, but it had Maniac Mode.
2112017	2113458	I really liked playing the oldies.
2113738	2116640	I mean, I loved playing Mr. Bassman.
2116680	2118761	I loved playing Surfing USA.
2118941	2120042	I hate the Macarena, though.
2120430	2122712	I sort of understand, you know, why they couldn't license them, though.
2122972	2124193	So, you know, it makes sense.
2124213	2125053	They took out Fire.
2125834	2128335	I'm hoping that they do... Not Fire, they took out Electric Light Parade.
2128715	2130136	Yeah, they took out the Electric Light Parade, which is great.
2130156	2131978	That was the one I liked.
2131998	2135520	I kind of hope if they do do a Disney mix, too, that we'll get the catch-up song.
2136064	2136364	No.
2137385	2137745	Never.
2138946	2139046	Never.
2139066	2139927	I miss battle.
2139987	2140907	I miss dance battles.
2159420	2170070	Battle, Dance Battle from Second Mix, Dance Magic I actually almost missed couple steps Having couple steps, like Second Mix was the last one to happen that I understand Didn't Third?
2170230	2180380	I don't know, maybe not Well, I mean, you can always do couples edits But it's not the same You know, I miss going up to a DDR machine and having to tell it to do verses
2182397	2192223	I remember going up to the 1.5 and holding my buttons down so I could play in versus mode so that we could have the same nifty little steps.
2192243	2192843	I kind of miss it.
2193944	2198867	I almost miss having to stomp around and do a code to put in Maniac.
2198987	2205231	I miss being totally messed up when USA came out because I was so used to playing on flat.
2205952	2206552	Right, right.
2208089	2232257	Okay, well, we're going to take a real quick break, and then we're going to come back, we'll talk a little bit more about MaxUSA, we'll talk about some other stuff, you know, while MaxUSA has been kind of taking all the news, kind of taking everyone's attention lately, there's been other news going on too, so we'll get to that, and a whole lot more, we've got a listless segment for you guys tonight, so do stay tuned, and we will be right back for you guys.
2232897	2238506	And we're going to start this off with a song that we kind of referenced a little bit during this last break.
2239147	2239348	Later.
2304915	2305856	Thanks for watching!
2351932	2367685	Touch me with your love and give me satisfaction When we get into action but don't talk dirty Take me in your arms and go for my obsession Give me all your passion, don't talk dirty to me Oh touch me, don't talk dirty to me
2398136	2398597	DarkSakura.com

2634913	2650377	Rockover London, Rockover Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio It's a good place to listen to the music That's not going to make sense to anybody unless you were listening that one Friday night Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio
2651462	2651742	Wee!
2651982	2652322	Wee!
2652743	2658005	And we've been talking about Max USA, and I believe Dave's in the other room right now trying to get through with the 17 song Oni.
2658025	2660646	He's on home base, the 17 song Oni.
2660766	2662487	He's on song 11 at the moment.
2662847	2664208	And he's passed all the hard stuff.
2664248	2672832	The only thing that I would be iffy on, because I haven't actually seen him in play yet, is the Do It Right, Two Step Harmonize, and the very last one, the Drop the Bomb System FX.
2673012	2675053	Oh, has he not even played that Do It Right mix yet?
2675453	2678375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2697411	2699073	Big news for us locally.
2699594	2700976	We had a tournament Saturday.
2701658	2702359	Big tournament.
2702439	2704061	Huge NorCal tournament this Saturday.

2729503	2732445	Registration starts at 10 o'clock right when the place opens.
2734145	2735686	Accuracy attack starts at 11.15.
2736146	2737987	Not perfect attack, accuracy attack.
2738007	2739147	We're having two lines.
2739407	2741748	We are having plenty of prizes, aren't we?
2742249	2747611	Loki, tell us about everybody who shows up has a chance to win huge prizes.
2748611	2749272	Tell us about this.
2749472	2750492	Oh, boy.
2751132	2755134	Well, I'm estimating already I'm bringing in at least 300 or 400 DVDs.
2755314	2756995	At least, and probably even more than that.
2757735	2763097	So why don't we have an opening stipulation for the first, say, 20 people who pre-register?
2763457	2764158	They get a DVD?
2765058	2766079	Or something, shit.
2766299	2767459	Oh, there's pizza.
2768079	2773962	Okay, so, yeah, as you heard, about 300 to 400 various DVDs that we're going to be giving away.
2774322	2779064	Now, we're not going to lie, they're not like cream-of-the-crop type DVDs, but they are good stuff.
2779084	2780424	There's great good stuff in there.
2780464	2781645	It's a lot of anime stuff.
2782585	2805383	and it's not all anime though we know not everybody who's into DDR is an anime fan like I don't know shit about a lot of animes but there's some other stuff in there too there's some great sci-fi stuff bling bling and things like that just tons and tons of DVDs are given away so just show up because you might win something I mean there's a very good chance you're going to walk out of there with something first 20 people who end up pre-registering are going to walk away with a DVD as well
2805623	2806804	Well, yeah, at least for $20.
2806904	2808925	If we register, we'll get a DVD.
2809025	2809705	Yep, at least.
2809965	2812046	So, going to be tons of prizes.
2813087	2815428	Do we want to talk about what kind of prizes are going to be given away?
2815448	2817669	Some of the special things that have been donated?
2817689	2818549	Or are we going to talk about that later?
2818569	2819450	There's still going to be secret with you.
2819470	2820150	Okay, there's going to be secret.
2820170	2821031	You will find out day of turning.
2821071	2826213	However, we are going to make, as Orange Lounge, we are going to be making a donation of a prize.
2826273	2826473	Yes.
2826513	2827494	The Orange Pack.
2827554	2829535	The Orange Pack will be donated as a prize.
2829695	2831936	Orange Lounge Radio is going to be donating an Orange Pack.
2832321	2834861	Yes, we've already bought one of the things for it.
2835182	2836342	It's funny.
2836922	2838722	Yes, and... Is that the pizza?
2838842	2839482	That wasn't the pizza?
2839662	2840242	Oh, okay, cool.
2840583	2842043	We'll take another break pretty soon then.
2842383	2849164	But for those that cannot make Shaft, because we know that we're an international show at this point.
2849184	2850564	We have lots of listeners in Japan.
2850904	2851524	Hello to you guys.
2851564	2852505	Thanks a lot for listening.
2852985	2855405	And Canada as well, got a lot of listeners, eh?
2856005	2858546	And where else do we have a lot of listeners I've been noticing?
2858566	2859026	Australia.
2859206	2859626	Australia.
2860046	2874379	Australia, yes Australia, Australia, we love you A place I am dying to visit someday Australia, we have a lot of listeners there And all over the globe, thanks to you guys for listening If you guys can't be there, that's okay We will bring Shaft to your living room
2875580	2877582	or your computer room or wherever you have your computer.
2878282	2882665	We are going to be broadcasting live from Shaft all day long.
2882745	2887669	The stream will start probably before the doors even open sometime at 9 or 10 in the morning.
2887689	2889150	We might get bored once we have everything set up.
2889170	2890791	Yeah, we might get bored once everything's set up.
2890811	2892532	We'll sing a little song.
2893053	2899857	Loki's going to pretty much be in charge of this because Jamie's kind of the queen of the tournament so she's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off making sure everything's in order.
2900058	2901859	I'm the empress, what you talking about?
2902299	2905502	and I'm going to be kind of emceeing the tournament with my buddy Tal.
2905562	2907904	I'm going to be up there doing the emcee duties.
2908265	2911568	So when Tal's doing the emcee stuff though, I'll be in the back helping Loki out with interviews.
2911608	2913049	But pretty much it's all going to be on Loki.
2913509	2915451	So welcome aboard as co-hosts.
2915551	2918234	Now do eight hours of radio all by yourself.
2918334	2919415	Oh yeah.
2919435	2919935	Gotta catch up.
2921056	2921216	So...
2922981	2929907	Basically, anybody who wants to, as you come off the stage from Perfect Attack, from Freestyle, whatever... What?
2930747	2931768	No?
2931788	2933269	Sorry, Accuracy Attack.
2933469	2935031	I gotta get in the habit, too.
2935111	2936772	I'm sorry, this ain't your mama's Perfect Attack.
2937412	2944498	As they come off the stage from Accuracy Attack, or Freestyle, or A-Team Freestyle... You just so sounded like Cartman.
2945299	2945799	A-Team.
2946880	2947640	Okay, whatever.
2947660	2951043	I'm calling it Perfect Attack if I want to, bitch!
2955574	2955754	Yes.
2955794	2956854	Jeez, Carmen!
2957815	2961037	As you guys finish, you can just walk right into the room.
2961057	2965460	You'll be escorted into the office and get the shit beaten out of you.
2965740	2965880	No.
2966281	2967622	And you'll be able to be interviewed.
2967642	2969663	Forge Lounge will tell all your friends to listen.
2970483	2973445	And if you are there at the event, you can't listen, that's okay.
2973485	2977508	We'll rebroadcast it probably at least twice on the station at some point.
2977988	2978969	If I can get it to archive.
2979009	2981151	I can't guarantee it'll be rebroadcasted, though.
2981411	2982972	We might not be able to get it to archive.
2983032	2983772	So I've just got to...
2985113	2986995	Get you guys all to listen on Saturday if you can.
2988556	2988736	Yep.
2989296	2989516	Yeah.
2990277	2990897	Anything else you want?
2991358	2991818	Oh, I burped.
2992118	2996001	Anything else you want to add about Shaft, Loki?
2997222	2998563	I'll be there judging.
2999523	3001325	Oh, you're doing the A-Team stuff, right?
3001405	3002405	Yeah.
3002966	3004627	So we got to plan.
3004687	3005367	Oh, shit.
3005407	3007629	Who's going to do interviews while you're judging for A-Team?
3007829	3009871	What about Rice Princess?
3009911	3010111	Oh, yeah.
3010131	3011772	We got Rice Princess and Brad, too.
3011932	3013113	We'll have them helping out.
3013564	3014105	Thank you, BR.
3014145	3014945	Raving Reporters.
3014985	3015166	Yes.
3015186	3016627	We have lots of people helping out.
3018329	3022713	So, if you want to pre-reg, that's open right now.
3023334	3028219	The address for pre-registration is ShaftStaff at Yahoo.com.
3029560	3033003	Make sure, though, that you actually look at the webpage first.
3033484	3036967	Go to SacPayMoney.com slash...
3038068	3043413	Sack09 Just go to SackBomani and follow the links.
3043513	3044954	That is the actual site.
3045375	3048137	That is the actual address that the pre-reg information is on.
3049498	3053762	Of course, you can just go to SackBomani.com click the link, click on Shaft and look there too.
3055303	3057445	I always like going directly to the site because that's just me.
3057585	3060086	Anyway, go ahead and have a look at it.
3060206	3065390	Make sure, though, that you do not leave any information out if you do not know what song you want to do.
3065730	3068592	By the way, the songs are located under the rules section.
3068932	3071794	Yeah, accuracy attack songs are up.
3072601	3075124	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3090037	3090877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3107522	3116008	I'm looking at, or AA in this case, I'm looking at the blink of an arrow a lot of the time to get the tempo, so I would kind of be fucked in that aspect, so it makes it a little more difficult.
3116228	3118630	You know, I would love to see you try to do something in Dark Reverse.
3118690	3123013	Well, sucks that I'm going to be up there doing, I can't participate because I already know all the songs.
3123033	3125354	We're going to be at Scandia before then.
3125414	3129377	I want to see you take the shaft challenge.
3130438	3131418	I think I can handle shafts.
3131458	3133059	Let's see if you can get the shaft.
3134060	3135541	I think I might like getting, anyway.
3137522	3140003	Whale.
3140363	3140703	Whale.
3140783	3141603	Is that special?
3141803	3144004	Also, Accuracy Attack, very game show.
3144624	3150605	The way we've got the brackets set up, very suspenseful, at least as much as a DDR tournament can be.
3151066	3153226	Don't rely on what we've named the categories.
3153286	3155867	We've got category names are starting to float around out there.
3156747	3157287	Nobody knows.
3157867	3160688	I say three people, I believe, on the planet know.
3160728	3161668	Literally three people know.
3161708	3164309	Literally three people know what are in those envelopes.
3164409	3166671	And only two of us actually have them written down.
3166711	3169033	Yes, and only two of us actually were there to write them down.
3169133	3173037	So, Scandia doesn't know what's in those envelopes?
3173077	3174418	Nope.
3175299	3177641	The best PA-ers in the nation don't know what's in those envelopes?
3177781	3179202	They can't be told either.
3180043	3181084	You can try bribing me.
3181804	3182465	It ain't gonna work.
3183345	3185667	You know, I'm like, let one song out for $90.
3185847	3188509	I wanted to wear a big sequined jacket to do the MC.
3188529	3191131	You totally need to do the Rod Roddy outfit.
3191651	3192732	Come on down!
3193432	3194373	Come on down!
3194573	3194853	Alright.
3195494	3198416	We're gonna take a really quick break because there's food here and we want to get some food.
3198456	3202519	So we're gonna play some Groovalicious 70s tune to get everybody in the mood for a shaft.
3203159	3207743	And then we'll come back and we're gonna talk some more about some other DDR things going on.
3208123	3209604	We hope you guys can tune in on Saturday
3210144	3213228	Saturday, starting at around 9 to 10 a.m.
3213848	3215450	for the Big Shaft livestream.
3215650	3215930	Yep.
3216311	3216631	All right.
3217272	3218233	We'll be right back.
3306765	3308952	Thanks for watching!
3375606	3377452	And now DJ, let's start rocking it, rocking it, rocking it
3444716	3449319	Whoa, hello, sorry gang, that's a bad mp3, so we're gonna just go right into the next song, sorry about that
3484856	3487318	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3514547	3515632	Thank you for watching!
3571318	3571758	and many more.
3617813	3628642	And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream The best thing for you, no, you can count on me, believe me There's a lovin' lady, you know what you found in me
3651928	3657716	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
3662285	3664286	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3664586	3671650	We were just talking about Sak Bamani hosting another fabulous tournament, also known as Shapt, which is going to happen this Saturday.
3671670	3673771	It's pretty soon already.
3673791	3674131	Yeah, I know.
3674151	3675031	I can't believe it's already here.
3675852	3676512	Crazy shit.
3677825	3678365	DDR Max USA DDR Max USA
3698914	3704197	All that they did was, Max 2 has been announced for the Japanese system, so we know that for a fact.
3704998	3710121	And now where people are getting their information is from GameFacts.com, and they said that it's been announced.
3710521	3712563	To be honest, I don't think it's credible at all.
3714043	3716105	I think, yeah, there probably will be one.
3716945	3717966	No, it hasn't been announced.
3718973	3719273	You know what?
3719313	3720253	I'm feeling the angst in this room.
3720273	3720433	Yes.
3741417	3742679	I'm thinking it's about time.
3742919	3744041	What, we're going to do some FUs?
3744341	3745403	Alright, let's do some FUs.
3745683	3747366	We're going to get into the FUs of the week.
3747406	3751933	This is the part where Jamie likes to go off and F something.
3753644	3756586	No, I had to go off and say, fuck them.
3757287	3761409	Fuck them right in their nose, because their ear and their ass aren't good enough.
3762070	3766113	Alright, and if you want to send your FUs of the week, just send them to me over in the chat room.
3766153	3770516	You can PM me over in the chat room, and we already had some people do that.
3770776	3774939	Or you can alternatively send us an email, but you've got to do it right now, because we only do this segment for a little bit.
3775419	3778521	Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.
3778661	3779082	Here we go.
3781198	3784039	Alright, my first one of the week.
3784419	3786140	Well, there's the fly, but the fly's dead.
3786800	3789841	There's the asshole with his horn, and I hope he dies.
3791442	3793342	I said what mine was going to be in the car, didn't I?
3794023	3794623	On the way over here?
3795263	3796123	Uh, license plate.
3796303	3797024	Yes, okay.
3798124	3803146	Dan comes home last night and proceeds to tell me that our license plate is missing off of our car.
3804506	3806247	It's nowhere to be found in the parking lot.
3807447	3809168	And the whole plate around...
3809972	3811053	The license plate is missing.
3811933	3818436	So, we're thinking it's either been stolen or has just fallen off, although it's kind of funny that two screws would fall off at once.
3818956	3827640	So, this actually, my fucker of the week is in, you know, for my man's benefit, that he has to spend however many hours at the DMV tomorrow to get that replaced.
3828380	3829160	My poor sweetheart.
3829801	3832042	And I'm going to hear about it all back tomorrow, too.
3832682	3834583	That's the worst part, is that now you have to deal with the bitching.
3834603	3839265	Drive your ass to work, and then go to the DMV, and then come back and work.
3840217	3841520	Oh my god, oh my god.
3842321	3846208	There are some days that we don't let the line move at all, we call those weekdays.
3848001	3848221	No.
3848921	3854203	Um, another fuck you of the week goes to this cold that just seems to be refusing to leave me.
3854643	3859325	I'm at the dead tail end of it and I'm still getting all I want to do is sleep.
3859485	3860585	I'm taking a nap.
3861285	3862746	Anyway, um, but yeah.
3862986	3866907	You know, they're not very big, powerful, evil fuck yous, but they are, so fuck you.
3867348	3868488	All of those things.
3868508	3869308	Yeah, whatever.
3870248	3871549	But, you know, thank you for people.
3872577	3873577	Is that all your FUs of the week?
3873817	3874157	Mm-hmm.
3874338	3875158	This is fucked up.
3875998	3876338	Okay.
3876698	3877979	Let's hear it from Loki.
3877999	3879019	You got any FUs of the week?
3880139	3881139	I have a new song.
3881720	3882100	Yes, you do.
3883100	3889662	And yes, I called this actually before the show, so for people that were recommending it during the show, I beat you to it.
3890202	3897704	Well, first FU of the week goes to Konami and DDR Max USA.
3899732	3900973	I hate Onis.
3901113	3902333	Yes, people like Onis.
3902514	3903334	I don't like Onis.
3903434	3905835	I don't like the fact I have to play Onis to unlock songs.
3906295	3906756	That sucks.
3906796	3908096	You don't have to.
3908656	3909317	Oh, yeah.
3909377	3909757	Oh, yeah.
3909797	3911238	I'll just play the game for months on end.
3911338	3912138	Don't fuck that.
3912178	3915540	I've got other games that came out the same week, like Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
3915560	3920162	They're beckoning my attention and not playing this stupid game constantly.
3920202	3922323	I've double-a'd almost everything on Heavy.
3922843	3928006	I don't need to fucking double-a everything in this whole game and still be playing and songs are still not unlocked.
3928866	3929406	It's fucked up.
3930106	3935288	Dave just beat, you know, the home base, you know, course, and the new Hardcore 21 still hasn't been unlocked.
3935528	3937088	So I guess I gotta play some more songs.
3937128	3937428	Really?
3937489	3938469	It didn't unlock Hardcore 21?
3938509	3939609	No, it didn't unlock that at all.
3939689	3943390	So I guess I gotta play about 500 more songs before that fucking thing gets undone.
3944611	3946911	But you got to see the Drop the Bomb remix, finally.
3947351	3947591	Yes.
3947911	3956734	Let me add that the Drop the Bomb remix, while the song is cool to step, suck ass, and the backgrounds, they took no time whatsoever to make that background.
3957134	3963156	They're like, yellow stick, you'll drop the bomb, background, and put System SF Remix on there.
3963896	3964456	Whoop-dee-doo.
3964957	3966437	So, that's my complaint.
3967737	3971919	Remember Brilliant to You, when they put out the orchestra groove, they just made it in pink.
3972859	3974200	But they changed colors, at least.
3974300	3975900	I mean, shit, they didn't do anything for this.
3976440	3978301	Okay, so, yeah, that's my complaint there.
3978541	3980902	The Onis, you know... Oh, that's another thing.
3980962	3981162	Part 421.
3982887	3987170	I took a 40-minute Oni, so if I fuck it up like 30 minutes into it, I gotta play it again?
3987570	3988071	Fuck that.
3988691	3989512	I'm not gonna do that.
3990132	3999238	No one should have to play a 40-minute Oni, and that and the fact, who's actually gonna have a homepad responsive enough to actually play a 40-minute Oni on a homepad?
4001383	4003885	You probably have to go through a couple of homepads while playing.
4003945	4007088	It's like you've burned out a whole new one just from playing that game.
4007808	4011051	I would feel bad for anybody trying to do that, like, not on a controller or whatever.
4011431	4014414	And even on a controller, your freaking hands are going to cramp up, too.
4014474	4019057	So, you know, F Konami for their... I mean, I like the fact that they put Onis in there.
4019098	4019578	That's cool.
4019878	4023981	But what the hell are you thinking, putting 21-song Onis and 17-song Onis?
4024022	4024922	That's just ridiculous.
4025803	4027304	That's like my 100-minute-long Oni.
4030660	4031901	Oh, does Dave have an FU?
4032281	4032821	A little bit.
4033582	4036363	Okay, this is better.
4037643	4041985	So, my FU also goes to Max USA, even though I've just played it like half an hour ago.
4043005	4045006	Also towards the Onis, but for a different reason.
4045486	4048648	I like them, but damn, I've got like Carpal Tunnel now.
4049228	4049668	Seriously.
4050248	4058972	And it's not just that, it's the fact that the backgrounds are really bright and really flashy, and so my eyes are really... You can turn that down in the options screen, you know?
4059972	4063735	I didn't know that after like three minutes, and I'm not going to go start over again.
4063755	4068820	Because, you know, to start over I have to play all the other songs again, I'm not going to do that shit.
4069661	4073564	So, FU, Oni, on Max USA.
4074285	4074585	Alright.
4074805	4077628	And how do you unlock Hardcore 21?
4078649	4082052	You have to basically give head to DDR Max USA.
4083231	4083892	That'll be hard.
4083912	4086915	Especially since it doesn't have either.
4089738	4090599	My FUs of the week.
4091540	4093362	I have a few, I guess.
4094143	4095825	My first FU of the week goes to Jamie.
4096626	4097247	What?
4097787	4099849	For getting me addicted to Animal Crossing.
4100050	4100770	You bitch.
4101929	4103970	Now I have to go spend money on a GameCube.
4105290	4108611	Just so I can have those annoying little assholes move into my neighborhood.
4109011	4109892	Rob lives in my neighborhood.
4109952	4111512	And an F you to Belle the cow.
4111912	4113153	You bitch, I hate you.
4113293	4114313	What did Belle do to you?
4114613	4116174	Belle's the nice one, Petunia's the bitch.
4116594	4118615	Yeah, an F you to Petunia, she sucks too.
4118935	4121896	And an F you to Mallory because she won't move out of our town.
4123417	4124899	However, Rob sent me fruit.
4125299	4126921	Yes, I mailed... He sent me an apple.
4127081	4130625	I mailed Jamie some fruit, and I mailed Dan some fruit, which he got.
4132107	4133408	Dan sent you clothes.
4133589	4134770	Yes, Dan sent me clothes.
4134790	4135611	I sent you rags.
4136392	4139275	So, F Jamie for getting me hooked on that crack rock.
4140797	4142399	My other F you goes to Psychos.
4143624	4146527	Psycho is online that want me to do dirty things on my webcam.
4146647	4147148	You suck.
4147288	4147808	Go away.
4148269	4148929	I don't like you.
4149890	4151051	Stop messaging me.
4151112	4151792	Stop mailing me.
4152233	4152673	It's sad.
4154415	4155296	F you to stalkers.
4158339	4160301	Now there's a difference between showing a little attention.
4160341	4162042	We like attention, but stalking, no.
4162283	4163123	Stop stalking, please.
4163204	4163604	It's sad.
4164064	4165426	I hate when I get runs in my stalkers.
4169136	4170116	I think that's all my FUs.
4170136	4171417	I don't think I really have anything else.
4172037	4173157	Maybe I'll think of something later.
4174057	4177158	Oh, FU to myself for sleeping through half of Halloween.
4178858	4185400	And FU, FU just like last week, FU to all my friends who get drunk while I have to drive.
4185740	4185940	FU.
4186240	4186660	I hate you.
4188581	4189141	Chatroom FUs.
4192944	4194605	My god, Twen, you've got too damn many.
4194625	4195806	I'm only reading your last three.
4196246	4200509	Twen says, F you, uh, from the manager to a dumbass.
4200609	4201530	It's supposed to be hard.
4201590	4202330	It's seventh mix.
4202850	4204511	Twen says, F you to another dumbass.
4204572	4205872	To me, I hate that song.
4205912	4206733	Every song he picks.
4207954	4208474	I've seen that.
4209475	4210415	Uh, F you to Konami.
4210435	4212837	They need to release more PS1 DDR titles in the U.S.
4214523	4215664	BlackLapSaga
4235124	4239467	F his roommate and his now girlfriend for once again getting naughty while he was in the room.
4239787	4247191	They went a bit further this time because moaning was heard, even over his headphones, and they ignored him when he threw a bottle at them to get them to stop.
4247271	4251613	Yes, that was my suggestion last night in the chatroom, to throw a bottle or poke him with a stick.
4251913	4253935	I was going for more of the poking with a stick.
4254855	4256076	Next time, set them on fire.
4257236	4257977	See if they notice.
4259322	4263444	He says, F everything that contributed to his inability to go to Shaft this Saturday.
4263504	4267766	Instead, he will be paintballing for his birthday, and he will not be able to listen to the broadcast.
4267786	4269527	Well, that's your choice, buddy.
4272408	4277151	Fuck his left side shift key for sticking so much lately, and fuck the fact that I still have no car.
4277211	4279132	Most of you know what I mean by that, and if you don't, too bad.
4280859	4281959	You should hang out in the channel more.
4282659	4283400	More Than Jay.
4284880	4288421	Fuck that slash emote sex doesn't work in real life.
4289581	4290982	I've never used a slash emote.
4291022	4291982	I guess that's... No.
4292442	4293262	Is that an AOL thing?
4293302	4293622	I don't know.
4293922	4294182	No.
4296283	4299164	And being sick and depressed sucks hard, so fuck that.
4299204	4299544	Yes, it does.
4299584	4299824	Yes, it does.
4299844	4300084	I agree.
4300104	4301264	You know what sucks worse than that?
4301404	4302485	Get back to my music for a minute.
4302905	4303245	Oh, okay.
4303285	4303425	Yes.
4305794	4309357	Having the flu and PMS at the same time.
4309938	4313200	That sucks more than anything has sucked before.
4313361	4314862	La la la la la la la.
4315182	4319286	Hey, this is the DJ... I just had to say that.
4319366	4319846	Mine tops.
4320246	4320527	Next.
4323049	4323970	Women in DDR.
4324630	4327312	Bite me.
4327433	4329795	Twin also says F you for not owning a PS2.
4329815	4330795	He just wants to clear that up.
4331296	4332257	Then get one.
4333157	4340300	Conundrum, a new person listening to the show, says, fuck you to the damn commies in the sky that watch me in DDR because DDR sucks.
4342501	4343002	I agree.
4345383	4351746	Fuck you to me for consistently changing names in the chat room because it was flipping back and forth between DarkSakura and Sky, so fuck that.
4351766	4353287	That's because I'm not at home.
4353707	4354107	When?
4354247	4358609	Rice Princess, our buddy, who's sometimes here during the live shows.
4358649	4359570	I wonder why she's not here tonight.
4359590	4360090	That makes me cry.
4361500	4366664	Fuck you to people who bring their babies to the 11pm showing of the movie The Ring last night.
4367004	4371067	You're hurting your child's ears as well as pissing off everyone who wants to enjoy the movie.
4371348	4371708	Thank you.
4372849	4374490	Oh, I have something along those lines too.
4374610	4374851	Yes.
4375251	4375891	Where's my music?
4377933	4378614	You and your music.
4380475	4382417	Okay, Dan and I were at Fresh Choice today.
4383758	4385641	Enjoying our lovely salads and soups.
4385901	4387223	I had really good acorn squash soup.
4387263	4388444	French Choice is a rip-off.
4388524	4389045	I'm sorry.
4389365	4390847	They charge something like nine bucks.
4390867	4392850	I'm trying to get my fuck you, so fuck you.
4392870	4393851	Let me have my fuck you.
4394172	4396495	Thank you.
4397756	4400059	This woman was... Do you still have that PMS thing going on?
4400480	4400700	No.
4400740	4401461	This is fucking weird.
4404116	4406738	Girl, I'm going to drop the bomb on your ass.
4407998	4410780	Nah, um, this little kid makes a mess.
4410820	4412120	You know, little kids make messes.
4412541	4416583	This woman comes up, her mom comes up to her and goes, Oh my God, what are you doing?
4416703	4417783	In the middle of a damn restaurant?
4417823	4418304	Oh my God.
4419284	4420385	And Dan and I look over.
4421198	4423200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4437035	4439537	And the thing is, is that you know who Dan and I are blaming for?
4439577	4440937	It is not the little girl we're blaming.
4440998	4442158	Her mom for being such a bitch.
4442678	4444500	So, fuck you, whoever you were, woman.
4444780	4446261	She didn't even look like a bitch, too.
4446361	4447141	Oh, my God.
4447201	4447441	Anyway.
4447561	4449542	Isn't that weird when, like, people just look like a bitch?
4449803	4450543	Like, you can just tell?
4450903	4451924	Some people should not breed.
4452224	4452524	Okay.
4454125	4456306	Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
4456687	4458067	Can I get back to the chatroom FUs now?
4458148	4458608	Okay, please.
4460005	4463808	We have another new person here, hello to you, it's EOSFVB.
4464768	4467871	I guess that's some kind of acronym, I don't know though.
4468351	4471933	He says, fuck you to AMD for making a 2.7 gigahertz.
4472333	4480479	When I get it, it's going to have this huge heat sink and fan, which is going to make a lot of noise, making him crazy, and also will exhaust a lot of heat, which will fuck over the whole global warming thing.
4481340	4481820	Don't run the heater.
4494073	4494893	I don't really have a choice.
4494973	4495893	Everyone else gets cold.
4496553	4497174	I don't get cold.
4497674	4497854	They do.
4497874	4503895	On Halloween, Dan and I were taking his dad out to dinner for his birthday, so that was more important.
4521741	4523042	and I was watching Friends.
4523682	4524722	Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
4526043	4527503	Hey, we were at Red Lobster.
4527744	4529184	IT vote Survivor, okay?
4529624	4531265	I didn't get to watch Survivor until the next day.
4531485	4532145	And I'm pissed.
4532425	4535347	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
4535967	4538308	Fuck you to Sukjai for voting out Sheehan.
4538488	4539068	Fuck you.
4540129	4540829	That's all I have to say.
4541689	4543050	And that means nothing to the rest of us.
4544531	4549132	JB says, um, F you to the little kid at RVGL who likes to grab asses.
4551101	4551482	What?
4554825	4555086	Okay.
4555106	4556187	All right, we'll just leave it at that.
4557288	4559571	Joe Mama, I think this is a good one to end on.
4559611	4560311	This is the last one.
4560351	4562974	He says, my fuck you is to school because it sucks.
4564616	4565137	Indeed.
4566018	4566819	That's why I don't go.
4570373	4572995	For those that don't know, I graduated high school several years ago.
4573055	4574396	I wish you were that simple.
4574517	4575017	I'm too old.
4575357	4576358	I'm too old for DDR.
4576458	4578260	F you to the fact that I have to go to work tomorrow.
4578920	4580141	Because I've had a whole week off.
4580862	4581302	That sucks.
4582143	4583564	Yeah, F you to work tomorrow.
4583704	4585946	I haven't had a week at all and I still don't want to go tomorrow.
4586306	4587107	I had Friday off.
4587127	4587788	That was so nice.
4587848	4588749	I could sleep until like 11.
4588789	4591831	I was supposed to meet Loki at like 9 and whoops, I slept.
4595640	4597141	Now that we've gotten those 5Qs out of the way.
4597401	4598401	Oh, I need to check the mail.
4598421	4599582	Let's see if we got any over email.
4600202	4602824	I have to give them the courtesy, because not everybody loves the chatroom.
4602944	4603084	Nope.
4603424	4607346	No 5Qs over mail, so... Fuck you to the listeners for not emailing us.
4607826	4608347	No, I'm just kidding.
4608367	4608847	We love listeners.
4608867	4609567	We love you.
4610828	4611628	We love you.
4611988	4612689	We love you.
4613149	4614550	We love you.
4614590	4615390	We love you.
4616070	4616331	What?
4616411	4617251	I don't know.
4617371	4619012	I can't think of anything that rhymed.
4620601	4623963	I brought up in one of the FUs, Survivor, a popular program on CBS.
4624463	4631566	Speaking of CBS, segue, segue, we have the early show finally happening tomorrow from what we're being told.
4631887	4634388	It's been delayed not once, but twice now.
4634408	4643372	It was supposed to happen on Halloween and I had the whole TiVo set up to tape it and lo and behold, it didn't even happen because I guess it rained or something so they couldn't do it.
4643992	4647274	The early show is like CBS's answer to Today, you know the Today show?
4647674	4648074	It's like a
4648414	4649635	Is this like a brand new show?
4649735	4651096	Okay, you know Good Morning America?
4651497	4653579	Okay, it's like, you know, the early new show.
4654119	4657862	And actually, yes, you're right, Loki, they just re-tailored the show recently.
4657882	4662606	They got rid of Brian, well, Brian Gumbel quit, I think, and the other chick got let go, and they have like a panel.
4664287	4665988	I don't know what the hell, but they're turning it into The View.
4666048	4668289	It's basically, now it's the early show, but it's The View.
4668969	4669289	But with men.
4669369	4675712	And by the way, for our listeners who are unfamiliar with my habits of watching TV, I don't.
4676312	4677953	Okay, just thought I'd clarify that for you.
4678493	4682455	So if somebody brings up a show to me, I'm usually going to go, what's that?
4683695	4686317	Or a commercial, I'm going to go, what's that?
4686957	4688517	The only thing I keep up with is Buffy.
4690037	4692000	And I haven't watched Buffy since the season started.
4693081	4696365	But I have to watch Buffy because I need to see James Marsters naked, okay?
4696946	4697307	Hello.
4697547	4698088	I need Spike.
4698476	4700057	Anyway, CBS, early show.
4702679	4704980	It's been delayed, but I guess it's finally going to happen Monday.
4705140	4709203	So if you guys are up early tomorrow, you should watch this, provided it doesn't get delayed again.
4709243	4712245	Perhaps I should check some of the big news sites and make sure it didn't get delayed again.
4712805	4717568	But I guess there's going to be some folks just out there playing DDR.
4717588	4718448	I'm not sure what they're going to do.
4718488	4720650	I don't know what arcade machine they're going to be playing or anything.
4721290	4721391	Wee!
4721571	4722352	That was the best dance!
4739781	4744506	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4760845	4762526	Okay, so we have the early show tomorrow.
4762946	4763666	What do you guys think?
4763726	4771169	I bet you it's going to be like, it's going to be one of those things they show in like cutting the commercials and then maybe they'll just kind of briefly mention it for two minutes.
4771489	4777551	They'll probably interview DJ 8-Ball or something and then, you know, we'll get to hear about it for weeks and weeks.
4779892	4784533	Wow, did you see that DDR was on CBS?
4784613	4785033	Wow.
4785353	4786634	Oh my God, it was to DDR.
4788166	4790827	And then, oh my god, they played Oops I Did It Again on MTV.
4790987	4792308	Bomani on TV, wow.
4797830	4799071	You know what MTV needs to play?
4799691	4800631	The Hot Limit video.
4801512	4803753	Oh my god, that video is so much ass.
4805173	4810115	You know what, you know what, we need to set aside a little bit of space and put the Hot Limit video up on the site.
4810436	4814457	I think at some point we're going to need to, because that video is like the fruitiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
4814717	4815878	That's fine, that's fine.
4817065	4817705	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4840985	4845627	Oh, I think I got one more FU coming, and it's for somebody that I like, Vandalus.
4846507	4851710	And he'll have to PM that to me, so send that over, and I'll get that FU in there before we go to another segment.
4853170	4856672	Moving along, would you like to do a sim update, Loki?
4856832	4858053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4877418	4878099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4903556	4908001	But no, keep your eyes on your TV people who are inclined to do so.
4908943	4919094	Also, for anybody who actually posts on the Sackman Money Board, if you go to the Leading Cyber Forum, there is a link to this commercial so you can download it for yourself and watch it.
4919495	4921117	It's absolutely hilarious.
4923408	4925369	Not as cool though as the Gacked one, I'm sorry.
4926989	4929050	For one of the other Metal Gear games.
4929090	4930650	I don't remember if it was Metal Gear Solid.
4930870	4932211	He's just going, I don't know.
4932731	4933351	I don't know.
4934151	4936011	The Gacked commercial was so funny.
4937292	4938432	I'll make that available somehow.
4938812	4939452	I'll make that available.
4939592	4940813	Gacked is the hottest woman.
4942753	4949115	I just have to say while we're on the topic of commercials, the one with Donald Trump and Grimace for McDonald's.
4949495	4950415	Okay, I'm clueless.
4951064	4952044	I know, I'm clueless too.
4952084	4953445	I don't watch enough TV.
4953465	4955165	Ever since I got TiVo, I fast forward through commercials.
4955585	4957586	Well, you know... I'm a whore for TiVo.
4957606	4958346	That shit is awesome.
4958986	4962507	Did you know... I have this theory, and I posted this on DDR Freak a while back.
4963167	4966828	That the McDonaldland characters represent different factions of the franchise.
4968228	4970609	Ronald represents the company itself.
4971329	4972809	The all-encompassing whole.
4974049	4976870	You have the early bird, who represents breakfast.
4978390	4980411	You have the fry guys, who represent the fries.
4981730	4989196	You've got Mayor McCheese, who's the cheeseburger, and Big Mac, the cop, and the Hamburglar.
4989356	4995401	Ronald isn't the crazy psycho who likes to lure children into his playlands.
4996122	4997763	But you know what?
4998103	5005169	Dan and I have been trying to think of what the Grimace represented, and we finally realized it.
5005550	5008312	This is what McDonald's wants its consumers to be.
5008979	5011060	Big, purple blobby things.
5011580	5015641	Is this like trying to compare the Wizard of Oz to the Dust Bowl, that whole thing in history class?
5015661	5016721	Is that where you're going with this?
5017201	5018541	Well, kind of, but no.
5018982	5023983	The other thing is, you know, the McDonald's franchise wants us all to be dim-witted, slow, and fat.
5024303	5025723	And live off of their food.
5026143	5028404	Where, you know what my impression of the Grimace is?
5028724	5031105	That's the expression you make after eating there.
5031625	5034446	No, but like, it's Donald Trump and Grimace.
5034666	5035846	You can't get a better couple.
5036466	5037627	I mean, that's too cool.
5037948	5038368	Donald Trump.
5038388	5039249	Maybe Ivana and Grimace.
5039269	5039829	And Grimace.
5040270	5042752	I'm sorry, Grimace is what you get after eating a Taco Bell.
5042832	5043893	I'm making a gift!
5045154	5045414	Hmm.
5046756	5051760	Ah, I got Vandalus' FU, and since we like Vandalus, we'll let him in a little late, because we didn't get it before.
5052421	5057646	Vandalus says FU to politicians for filling his mailbox the past week with snail mail spam.
5057666	5057866	Vandalus!
5061074	5065159	and for all those stupid fucking poster things that are out there.
5065680	5067141	I swear to God, there's like so many of them.
5067161	5070986	God, it's like being in high school and seeing all the posters around campus, you know.
5071006	5072507	It's like, hello people.
5072968	5074770	Vote Jamie for class president.
5074810	5075431	She rocks.
5075591	5078154	It's not the number of posters that wins you the votes.
5080151	5080551	Get a clue.
5081751	5084952	Is your vote going to be based on something different there, Dave?
5086133	5092554	Yeah, I'm going to go around and tabulate how many posters are up, and then I'll vote for the person who spent the most time putting them all up.
5093514	5095175	Thank God you're not 18 and can't vote.
5095655	5096575	You know what?
5097135	5098856	I remember how that was in high school.
5099776	5102957	And one year, I put up a poster that says, vote for me because I wasn't nominated.
5105587	5112579	I have a late response to your commercial about the Metal Gear Solid commercial from 23rd Magazine.
5112900	5114402	The truck has started to move!
5115224	5115564	Yes!
5115905	5117408	Oh my god, I love that!
5118636	5120717	Oh no, the Treadcafts started to move.
5123819	5125199	All right, we're going to take a really quick break.
5125219	5127661	We're going to come back and we're going to do a listless segment.
5128681	5129522	Everybody's favorite.
5129622	5133023	And now you can participate through email as well, but we like it if you're in the chat room.
5133464	5137145	Go ahead and join the chat room, any other side IRC server.
5137265	5140007	You can join irc.egheads.org as your server.
5140627	5143389	And you can join karma.othersideirc.net.
5143449	5147831	And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge is what you're going to join.
5148551	5153695	And tonight, the list list is going to be a little bit different.
5154836	5158118	We decided we're selling out this week since Max USA just came out.
5158719	5160700	And we're going to pretty much suck Konami's dick tonight.
5161300	5169166	And what we're going to do... The views expressed by Rob are not necessarily those views expressed by the cast members.
5170107	5176812	Pretty much tonight what we're doing, we're doing best Konami game, not the money.
5177792	5180473	So best Konami game that wasn't Bomani.
5180493	5181053	We're going old school.
5181093	5182353	Or we're possibly going new school.
5182433	5183913	It could be arcade games.
5184553	5186574	It could be damn near anything.
5186654	5187854	So stay tuned.
5187874	5189034	We're being specific with this.
5189674	5190994	We'll be right back.
5191014	5191995	We're going to start this off.
5192015	5197396	We're going to have an old school Beatmania song and a really old school DDR song in this mix.
5197656	5200936	We're going to start it off with one more new school Max USA track.
5201276	5205177	This is Do It Right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5392848	5403632	DMT is a tab, don't think what I suck, and T to bring something, don't sleep on the end, you see something like brother, it don't take time for me to blow your mind, it take a second to record because you dumb and block, so just laugh, but you're an empty cloud under the sun.
5427667	5428391	Thanks for watching!
5463189	5464749	I like to move it, move it.
5465030	5466770	You like to move it.
5467110	5468651	I like to move it, move it.
5469051	5470791	I like to move it, move it.
5470991	5472832	I like to move it, move it.
5472852	5474832	You like to move it.
5474892	5476533	I like to move it, move it.
5476673	5478674	I like to move it, move it.
5478754	5480374	I like to move it, move it.
5480634	5482335	You like to move it.
5482895	5484515	I've been all over the world.
5492318	5495375	And when you move your body, wanna move it nicer
5561434	5570102	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, letter A, and the number B9.
5570142	5575646	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
5576267	5578169	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5578809	5579109	Hi-ho.
5579129	5579750	Cut it, dude.
5582332	5584034	And as promised, here we go with...
5584761	5587423	Tonight's list list segment, yay!
5588964	5594428	This particular list list is non-Beinami Konami games.
5594728	5595228	That's right.
5595569	5602974	Whether it be stuff that's been in the arcade, whether it's been in America, whether it was only released in Japan, whether it's super obscure, we're talking about them.
5604580	5605961	Oh god, I love you!
5606782	5608023	Freakin' press your luck.
5608523	5609624	No whammy, no whammy!
5610004	5610425	Stop!
5611225	5611806	Okay.
5612206	5612906	Okay, sorry.
5614207	5615388	That's so old school, this is cool.
5615408	5617350	They're teasing you in the chatroom for saying Ben-Mommy.
5617370	5619712	I said Ben-Mommy.
5620452	5622394	No, you flubbed it up, that's okay.
5622914	5626877	Okay, my analysis is full of snot.
5627418	5630300	You try talking with a stuffed up head like mine...
5631540	5633184	And then we'll see, okay?
5633665	5633986	Bitches.
5634246	5634607	Here we go.
5634627	5635288	But I love you anyway.
5636290	5639377	So, best, and this can be as old school or as new school as you want.
5639457	5642704	Dave, your number three choice for best Konami, not a Bomani game.
5643044	5646106	Okay, my number three choice is an arcade game, Police 9-1-1-2.
5646126	5653550	Because that game is cool, and it kind of defeats the purpose of having the game be called 9-1-1-2.
5653610	5655291	The Police!
5655352	5659314	If you think about it, the Japanese name was Keisatsu-kan, so... It makes sense.
5659374	5659794	Yeah!
5666098	5666298	Yes.
5667199	5670723	Loki, what's your number three choice for Konami thing?
5671043	5671464	All right.
5671564	5674026	Totally old school arcade game here.
5674487	5676349	It's the Ninja Turtles arcade game.
5676449	5677270	Ninja Turtles.
5677570	5678191	Oh, yeah.
5681835	5682075	Why?
5683757	5686199	I used to plug so many quarters in that machine.
5686500	5687080	It's not even fun.
5688510	5690252	I remember one night being at the arcade.
5690792	5694115	This was, by the way, the same day my brother got hit by a car and was in the hospital.
5694375	5696977	But anyway, these guys paid me to play as Leonardo.
5697418	5698699	And we got to the end of the game.
5698779	5702342	We had freaking... What was the name?
5702382	5702682	Crane?
5703803	5711749	Yeah, we had Shredder beaten and the other guy, and then they turned off the machines at Lab's Castle because they were kicking us out.
5711949	5712269	Bitches.
5712569	5717953	The only multiplayer game that I liked more than the Ninja Turtles was the X-Men six-player game that came out.
5718453	5719474	I don't think that was Konami, though.
5720074	5721395	I don't think it was Konami.
5721835	5724017	Anyway, my number three... Jamie's number three.
5724557	5726939	And by the way, I picked games that I own because I'm cool.
5727779	5732144	I almost said Gradius II, because everybody knows how much I love Gradius II.
5732524	5733105	Burning Heat?
5733345	5733625	Yeah.
5733866	5738470	Well, instead what I picked for my number three was Kid Dracula on Game Boy.
5739331	5741954	Where you play as Super TV Alucard.
5741994	5743536	Damn, that's old school.
5744176	5754306	I, and you know, the thing is, is like, if you look on the old Funkoland lists, you know, when they used to have the prices on those pages like that, the game is a $30 game, even used.
5755327	5758350	So, it's really hard to find.
5758390	5765237	If anyone can find the game, you can get ROMs, though, for the Famicom, the Famicom ROM, online.
5766258	5767499	If no one's ever played it, check it out.
5767799	5768480	It's hilarious.
5770203	5773567	My number three pick is Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.
5773707	5777090	That game was the shit.
5777150	5778531	Fuck you if you don't like that game.
5781014	5782115	Two was the bomb.
5782235	5787000	Because they completely fucked up the first one in the best ways possible.
5787160	5788681	And the music owned and everything.
5789202	5791043	So, Castlevania II it is.
5791764	5793466	Dave, your number two pick.
5794498	5797380	My number two pick is Gradius, the original.
5798381	5799061	This is cool.
5799381	5804104	From newest of school to oldest of school, Gradius for what, Nintendo Arcade?
5804585	5805926	It doesn't matter, I'm not putting systems down.
5806026	5806486	Arcade.
5806526	5807987	I don't know.
5810328	5810929	I guess Arcade.
5811624	5816327	The reason why I'm specifying systems on mine is because a couple of games on here did have variations from system to system.
5816687	5818388	Yeah, well, we'll be okay, I guess.
5818708	5820309	I guess arcade is... I don't know.
5820469	5820769	Alright.
5822310	5823811	So, is there any particular reason, Gradius?
5824711	5825111	It's cool.
5825512	5826012	Alright, cool.
5829154	5829994	Loki, number two?
5830534	5836958	Alright, number two... I'm gonna have to go with Dracula X.
5839092	5844779	Ah, Dracula X, which one, the one that they put on what, TurboGrafx, or which one?
5846281	5849105	Which one, the number, Castlevania 5, or what?
5849645	5851768	I don't know, it's on PlayStation, I know that.
5851828	5853150	Alright, okay, that'll work.
5853690	5854511	Dracula X, okay.
5856394	5857275	Well... Dracula X...
5859258	5860358	No, that was my number one.
5860699	5861819	Well, that's okay.
5861899	5863020	We have a duplicate, so what?
5863940	5865301	Oh, oh, Loki's going to change it?
5865461	5866421	Okay.
5866461	5866961	What's that then?
5867421	5869402	We'll just go with Metal Gear Solid.
5869522	5870663	Metal Gear Solid, okay.
5874184	5876145	Switching gears and putting Metal Gear Solid.
5878526	5879626	Jamie, you're number two big.
5879766	5881907	Number two, Sexy Parodius for Saturn.
5882648	5883048	Yes.
5884788	5885829	Sexy Parodius.
5886508	5897957	I came close to saying Olshaberry Parodius, but Sexy Parodius just kicks its ass because you can play as Winby and Twinby and the guys on the paper airplane and the little bunny girls riding the rockets.
5898838	5899739	The game is so cool.
5900419	5904383	And what other game can you totally destroy a Las Vegas showgirl in?
5905584	5908486	And a pirate ship with a kitty cat face on it.
5909753	5912394	I see in the chat room, I see Guardian Legend being mentioned.
5912434	5913494	We should point out that's not Konami.
5913514	5914475	Guardian Legend was made by Irem.
5914595	5915975	That's made by Irem.
5916075	5916555	Broderbund.
5916975	5917876	Released by Broderbund.
5918336	5919756	Who were the same people that made Lode Runner.
5919776	5921057	And if you remember Lode Runner, you're cool.
5922137	5925018	My number two pick is Life Force.
5926004	5927506	Life Force is awesome.
5928086	5928927	Salamander series.
5928947	5930709	The honky version of Gradius II.
5931189	5932891	Well, it wasn't really Gradius II, it was Salamander.
5932911	5933472	Life Force was Salamander.
5933492	5933612	Right?
5933992	5936535	But they called it Gradius II here, in America at least, didn't they?
5936715	5937916	No, it was Life Force.
5938217	5941740	I remember they kind of... The reason why I know this is because I found my Nintendo cartridge of it last night.
5941881	5942361	Ah, okay.
5942822	5943102	Fair enough.
5944528	5948609	Okay, for my number one pick, I had Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
5949170	5949930	Ah, good pick.
5950190	5954351	I think that would have been on my list if I didn't already know you were picking that.
5954431	5957012	Yeah, I had trouble coming up with some Konami games.
5957912	5967595	But I just really love that game and the music owned, and the fact that you can play as Alucard and I think Richter and the girl, I forget.
5967996	5972317	You can only play as Maria on the Saturn version, and the Saturn version had two extra levels.
5973513	5976515	You can play as Maria after you... Well, that was a rumor, I think.
5976555	5978116	I don't think it ever really was possible.
5978396	5982879	The thing about it is that Maria was supposed to be playable on the original, plus they had the other two levels done.
5983339	5986661	If you notice, there's a little trick you can do when you first run into the corridor.
5987381	6000629	If you go back to that first corridor and stomp on this trapdoor, you can go down the trapdoor to a save room, but that save room leads to the underground garden on the Saturn version.
6001230	6003091	So, a little bit of trivia.
6003371	6003611	Hmm.
6004052	6004332	Okay.
6005053	6006775	Strider is Capcom, we should point out.
6006875	6014342	Frogger is a Konami game, but I think... I think somebody else put it out and then Konami distributed it.
6014683	6015323	I'm not sure.
6015684	6016184	It's Atari?
6016484	6016785	You sure?
6018246	6021608	I guess it's one that Konami distributed a version of it.
6022448	6024149	Maybe they were just the distributors of it or something.
6024169	6024429	I don't know.
6024449	6025089	Anyway, who cares?
6025450	6027070	It hasn't showed up on the list yet.
6027491	6028211	Alright, you're number one.
6029432	6030292	Loki, you're number one.
6032933	6035995	I'm torn, but I'm going to have to go with Contra.
6036915	6042758	Let's go with Contra Shattered Soldier because that's the brand new one and it's everything Contra should be.
6043299	6044939	Except very, very, very, very hard.
6045060	6047821	But I guess Contra's supposed to be very, very, very, very, very hard.
6048440	6050442	My number one is Dracula X, Rondo of Blood for the PC Engine Duo
6062717	6064018	Game was not released in America.
6064098	6069119	By the way, for all of you who own the Super Nintendo version, I feel so sorry for you because it's totally butchered.
6070100	6074221	Dracula X Rondo of Blood has the best music ever.
6074641	6075942	The best levels ever.
6076042	6081164	This is like... And I actually... My friend had to pay Dan and I back for...
6081984	6083325	DRACULAX
6105323	6108524	Very popular series in Japan, but they didn't do much with it here.
6108764	6115606	They released a couple games, I think, but I swear this is... I'm naming the American version of this because this is the one I remember playing as a kid.
6115886	6117147	This version was the shit.
6117407	6118387	This game is the shit.
6118887	6119548	It was awesome.
6119828	6122769	It had Gradius in it, you might remember, in one little part.
6123129	6124709	It is The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
6131473	6134615	The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was like the best Super Nintendo game they did.
6134635	6136416	Maybe next to like Actraiser, I don't know.
6136436	6139659	I do have to offer an honorable mention to a series.
6139939	6141120	The Konami World series.
6141721	6142561	Konami World.
6143081	6148262	They were released in Japan on the Famicom.
6148562	6153743	They were basically, you play as two generic characters who could go to different Konami games.
6154403	6155763	You had a Castlevania world.
6156364	6157944	You had a Gradius world.
6158004	6159364	It's like Kingdom Hearts Konami.
6160084	6164085	Yeah, it was kind of like that, but it's pretty funny.
6164485	6169346	But, you know, that's also one that you probably will have to find in a ROM now because it's...
6170146	6170406	Konami!
6170427	6170647	Konami!
6170667	6170827	Konami!
6191106	6209384	Police 911 Part 2, Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, Kid Dracula, Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest, Gradius Arcade, Metal Gear Solid, Sexy Proteus, Life Force Slash Salamander, Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Contra's Shattered Soldier, Dracula X, The PC Engine Version, and The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.
6210105	6210946	Shit, this is hard.
6211106	6213548	Okay, but you get to start it off, Dave.
6213668	6214990	Which one's coming off the list?
6216129	6216449	You're a bitch.
6216489	6219912	I still live for Castlevania 3, or Super Castlevania 4.
6220452	6220873	Anyway, Loki...
6246401	6262373	I'm never really a fan of a game where the bullets travel like 20 miles an hour, so I'm going to have to take off Police 911 too, because bullets are supposed to travel at bullet speed and not at fly, slow paper airplane speed.
6262813	6264534	That's the one I was going to eliminate, Daniel.
6264714	6272320	Did you not mention, did you forget to remember that you're Superman, you're faster than a speeding bullet, so everything moves like slow motion.
6273598	6285016	bullet time alright, Jamie, your turn god life force is so freaking hard you know, I'm thinking about see, I have memories attached to all of these games that's the sad thing
6286599	6292065	I have to leave Lifeforce on there, just because even though that game is harder than hell, it's awesome.
6292125	6295930	Symphony of the Night is awesome, even though the Saturn version is great.
6297331	6300335	Contra has the turtle with the fetus ass.
6302157	6306362	I never really played the Goemon game, so I had to give it a boot.
6307179	6308221	You are a bitch.
6308982	6309723	I'm sorry.
6309963	6313087	You know, I really... I'm just being picked on tonight.
6314108	6319716	You know, I've always wanted to, but because I have no experience attached to that game, I'm taking it out.
6320056	6320617	Alright, well...
6322119	6326162	That's okay, because I can get a little revenge, because this one was my next pick to go off the list.
6326803	6330645	So my apologies to Jamie, but Kid Dracula, come on.
6330746	6338691	Game Boy, I just don't have much sentiment attached to that game, and as Dave mentioned earlier, if you're going to have a Castlevania game on the list, it needs to be Symphony of the Night.
6338812	6341414	Or Dracula X is a good choice, too, but not Kid Dracula.
6341454	6344296	The Chibi-Alo card with the spiky dragon ball hair.
6344496	6346758	I played it once, and didn't need to play it again.
6347358	6348419	So, sorry, Jamie.
6348439	6350060	And when you hit them, they go, poof!
6350260	6353823	I was considering Contra Shattered Soldier, but I don't know.
6354043	6356745	That game is so disgustingly beautiful.
6357046	6357326	Alright.
6359207	6359928	Ninja Turtles.
6360088	6361990	Okay, so here's the final list you guys have to vote on.
6362030	6365873	You can send me your votes over a private message in the channel during the next song.
6366934	6368255	Random note right there for you, Jamie.
6368755	6369116	Look at that.
6370076	6370516	Okay, cool.
6370676	6370956	Thank you.
6371557	6373917	And I'm closing out all my windows so you guys can send me your votes.
6373957	6379199	As soon as I post the list in the chat room, you guys can send me your votes over private message.
6379319	6380800	Send them over to Sky in the chat room.
6380920	6382060	Or you can send them over email.
6382080	6382981	You've got to do it right now.
6383121	6387502	OrangeLoungeRadioYahoo.com Jamie's going to read for you all the final list here.
6387782	6388402	Once it's posted.
6389103	6389843	Alright, go for it.
6390503	6391544	As soon as you put those back up.
6391704	6392164	Yeah, there you go.
6392184	6392324	Sorry.
6393803	6408334	We have the Ninja Turtles Arcade Game, we have Gradius Arcade, we have Metal Gear Solid, we have Sexy Proteus, we have Life Force Salamander, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Contra Shattered Soldier, and Dracula X PC Engine Duo version.
6410126	6418369	So, we're going to play a quick song for you guys, and then we'll come back and... What, we're going to do Burning Heat?
6418489	6421270	Okay, that's kind of a cute one.
6422631	6423191	Let me pull it up.
6423211	6424632	I'm going to go ahead and do the one from 2DX.
6424672	6425672	We don't usually play this one.
6425732	6427033	We usually play the one from DDR.
6427073	6430554	So we'll do the one from 2DX, and we'll be right back.
6430594	6432555	So you guys have about two minutes to vote.
6432575	6434496	We'll do two songs, and then we'll come back.
6435356	6435596	See ya!
6509336	6510430	Thanks for watching!
6755031	6757176	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or we will kill you.
6764918	6765539	and your firstborn.
6766199	6766479	All right.
6768781	6769221	Here we go.
6769281	6771383	We have the final list all prepared for you guys.
6772684	6779890	The winners are, for the best non-Bamani, best burp goes to Sky.
6779930	6780290	Thank you.
6780770	6782692	Actually, Jamie had the best burp two weeks ago.
6783412	6783692	Thank you.
6784033	6785013	That one was really weak.
6786033	6787554	And now they're fighting over this question.
6787594	6789395	Before I get to the list, we'll answer this question.
6789735	6792297	They're fighting over how many options you can have in Gradius.
6792317	6792557	Four.
6793718	6794879	You're pretty convinced it's four?
6795019	6796960	You can have four options in Gradius.
6797040	6799602	But the Nintendo versions, you think there might have been only two?
6800002	6803304	I think in the Nintendo version you can only have two, and I think in Life Force you can only have two.
6803684	6810328	But in Gradius, you could have four options, because I know that there are some bosses that you cannot beat unless you do the straight line.
6810368	6813370	I seem to... You are up, and you have your options trailing behind you.
6813390	6814231	You know, I think...
6814671	6815392	Life Force was two.
6815432	6815852	Life Force was two.
6815892	6816173	And Gradius.
6816213	6817234	I know for a fact that Gradius was four.
6817254	6818034	Life Force is a fucking car.
6836152	6836432	DarkSakura.com
6853366	6854688	Go to my house and plug them in.
6854708	6855269	Super Eurobeat No. 1!
6868645	6870246	Anyway, here we have our winners.
6870366	6871166	Yes, we have our winners.
6871246	6874547	Jenny, in third place, what is our third place winner?
6874847	6875927	Sexy Parodius.
6876127	6876807	Yeah.
6877167	6879308	That game is so freaking cool.
6880048	6884489	Like for the reasons I mentioned before, just because I like blowing up a Las Vegas showgirl and killing her to death.
6885049	6885409	All right.
6885509	6886270	Killing her to death.
6886310	6887450	Yay, there's redundancy for you.
6888190	6890811	Number three, we have Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
6892092	6899356	Or, for those of us who imported it, it would be Dracula X2 Nocturne in the Moonlight.
6900797	6902198	It was officially in the Dracula X series.
6902218	6903378	Which is a travesty.
6903799	6904919	It should have been number one.
6905240	6907021	You people have no taste, but that's fine.
6907541	6908562	Number one.
6908982	6909762	Drumroll, please.
6911423	6912784	Ninja Turtles arcade game.
6914305	6915446	I have such fond memories of that.
6916075	6918040	By somewhat of a landslide, might I add.
6918200	6921629	My God, it got like, what, 65 votes, something like that?
6921649	6921849	A lot.
6921869	6923634	A lot for Turtles, the arcade game.
6924059	6926060	Which is okay.
6926520	6928341	It's an okay first choice, I guess.
6929482	6931623	But Symphony of the Night still should have been your number one.
6931863	6934004	And for that, I reprimand all of you in the chatroom.
6934584	6942608	I was so addicted to Symphony of the Night when it came out, but when the Saturn version came out, I blew through the whole game with Maria.
6943269	6945530	Oh my god, she kicks Alucard's ass.
6946591	6948331	Maria is so powerful in that game.
6949432	6951313	There's very few places that she can't get to.
6953522	6960165	And then, um... There's also, though, I mean... What?
6961405	6962486	I'm just laughing at chat things.
6962546	6962766	Okay.
6963126	6964667	Oh, yeah, you saw something I pulled in the chat.
6964687	6964847	Okay.
6965227	6968268	We'll let Jamie finish her thought, and then we'll go on to the other tangent.
6968288	6970329	My thought just got deflated, so you go ahead.
6970809	6971790	Go on your tangent.
6971830	6972530	See if I care.
6972950	6974271	I have my propel to keep me happy.
6976072	6976372	Okay.
6977532	6977732	Ooh.
6978893	6980234	Pardon me while I eat on air.
6980474	6981034	Nom, nom.
6983015	6983896	Only on the internet.
6997594	7002218	What other game could you get Castlevania with Metroid-style gameplay?
7002618	7002938	I know.
7003559	7010944	Hey, you can't forget the cliche Ninja Turtles thing, which had, well, two things, really.
7011125	7019291	For the pseudo-3D, it had the diagonal walking down part, you know, where you had, like, sort of, you're going towards the camera, but not really.
7019611	7024055	Then you also had the jet hover skateboard things, for no apparent reason.
7024335	7024495	Hmm.
7026329	7027229	All right, so whatever.
7027650	7030110	There's always going to be the Turtles people versus the Castlevania people.
7030130	7033191	Hey, Turtles in Time was cool, and fuck RVGL for getting rid of it.
7033512	7034072	Yeah, that's right.
7034112	7034492	Fuck them.
7034832	7037293	I was actually before... They need a Castlevania arcade game.
7037313	7039854	It was close between Ninja Turtles and the Simpsons arcade game.
7040594	7048817	The Simpsons arcade game was one I'm surprised didn't make the list, but it's the same engine as Turtles, so it's pretty much... I think a lot of people maybe are thinking Simpsons when they vote for TMNT.
7048837	7049097	Who knows?
7050278	7051239	Propel, Ghetto Kool-Aid, but not
7070902	7074183	Propel, the orange lounge choice of drink while playing DDR.
7074943	7075784	Another random note.
7076704	7089528	A new test version of Max Extreme, or Max Extreme, DDR Extreme came out this week, and apparently Sakura has been removed as the extra stage replaced with another paranoia, and Black Lab would like me to take a minute to tease Loki about it.
7089888	7090968	Tease, tease, tease.
7091749	7092349	Your response.
7092569	7093989	First off, the machine's not done yet.
7094649	7099351	So if they've had the song done and completed, and it's a Konami original...
7100186	7101387	Why wouldn't they put it in there?
7102247	7104248	Hello, there's going to be 200 fucking songs.
7104468	7106049	It's going to be in the goddamn machine.
7106989	7108430	It might not be an extra stage.
7108590	7111752	No, guaranteed it's probably not going to be an extra stage because that would be kind of redundant.
7111992	7114433	You play Max and you play Max again.
7115013	7115954	So that would be kind of stupid.
7115994	7117795	But it's going to be in the goddamn machine.
7117915	7120136	Revenge, the song's done.
7121717	7122897	It's a Konami original.
7123858	7124618	What more do you need?
7126169	7128050	Alright, that's Loki's official response.
7128430	7130591	Dave has another random note he wants to bring up before the show's over.
7131211	7135532	On a side note, I AAA'd the Remember Me or Remember You, what is it?
7135892	7136533	And nothing.
7137433	7138773	You obtained the highest dance level.
7139274	7139614	That's it.
7140954	7142695	No, you don't get shit for AAAing anything, I don't think.
7142735	7144235	I think you get one of the earlier unlocks.
7144455	7146156	Something you've already unlocked by playing enough songs.
7147296	7157199	Okay, and one more random note, because I promised you guys I would mention this in the chat room, I talked about this at the beginning of the show, somebody asked, when is Orange Lounge going three hours?
7158345	7159366	We've been discussing this.
7159386	7162487	We've been discussing this, and we are going to up the show to three hours.
7162747	7164288	And it's going to start... Eventually.
7164308	7165689	We're going to tell them.
7165709	7166029	Let's tell them.
7166489	7168510	We will start that with episode number 20.
7168631	7172333	Episode number 20 will be the first three-hour show, and that is, by the way, in two weeks.
7173373	7176475	Next week, we're going to be just too fucking exhausting after Shaft, I think.
7176515	7180877	We're going to have a lot of Shaft wrap-up, a lot of interviews, a lot of out-of-towners next Sunday.
7180897	7181557	That'll be a big show.
7181578	7183058	But the first three-hour show will be in two weeks.
7183078	7183779	Yeah, what do you want?
7183879	7185540	Shit, man, we're doing an eight-hour show.
7185600	7186040	Come on.
7188795	7192458	Okay, and Jamie's got some things she's talking about for the afterbirth here.
7192678	7199665	Yeah, for the afterbirth we'll go a little bit old school so I can, you know, let you know about one of the greatest and least appreciated systems ever.
7200791	7208637	All right, and give me some more, everybody go around and give us your final thought, because I'm still trying to get the show, end of show wrap-up in here.
7209177	7211679	Let's see, final thought, actually, I didn't get to do it.
7212980	7213821	All right, go for it.
7214742	7223028	Really not too much going on other than the DDR Max USA DWI is coming out, thanks to me, and Team Guilo Max, I guess.
7223428	7226450	Oh, speaking of Team Guilo, they're gone again.
7226590	7227671	I don't know where they went.
7227991	7230853	It's news to me, so they're just bye-bye.
7231174	7234476	And X-Step Release Candidate 4 is out.
7234756	7239880	It's also probably going to be version 1, so go check that out if you use it or not.
7240420	7249827	And see, other than that, I'm going to be getting back onto the 2DX project, so I'll have more of those 2DX sim files coming out for you guys to play on StepMania.
7251068	7252249	And that's about it.
7252429	7253670	Alright, Dave, any final thoughts?
7256090	7258151	Homework blows ass.
7258992	7259472	That's it.
7260332	7268815	MaxUSA, if anyone knows how to get the Hardcore 21 unlock, tell Rob, or post it, so I can look.
7269135	7269456	Alright.
7269836	7270676	Jamie, your final thought?
7273177	7274577	Besides your random coughing fits.
7277078	7281040	All of you people, go play Kid Dracula.
7282429	7283610	You'll love me for it.
7283790	7285391	Play Kid Dracula in Konami World.
7285832	7288373	Go obscure, because I say so.
7289254	7289894	And drink Propel.
7291075	7292276	And come to Shaft.
7292736	7293357	Come to Shaft.
7293417	7295058	My final thought of the night.
7295258	7298880	Come to Shaft, and I need a date.
7299141	7300922	That's it.
7301042	7301482	Stay tuned.
7301502	7303784	We're going to be playing more music for you after the show's over.

7340042	7342424	You fin to raise up and get your travel on?
7342945	7349171	From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes.
