Message for you, son!
Attention!
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?
That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.
What's your favorite scary?
Showgirls.
Absolutely frightful.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty.
And your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gang?
No one expects a Spanish exposition!
It's Kendo.
DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
We are live and this is episode number 20 for November the 17th of 2002.
But not November 20th.
It is our second season premiere.
And that was most rejoicing.
Yay.
It's like fall sweeps.
It's sweeps week.
In this episode, Jamie's going to get married.
I don't.
Fuck you.
And Loki's going to have a baby.
No.
No.
You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most premier radio station of all things Bimani.
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
You know who better as DarkSakura.
Say hello to our newest co-host.
Well, not really because he's been here since the beginning.
It's our TechMassaLoki.
Hello, everybody.
and we have some special guests in studio tonight.
Say hello first off to a chat room frequenter, our chat cookie that has finally crossed to the other side of the monitor and he's here in the studio tonight.
Say hello to Black Lab, everybody.
Hello, everybody.
Now fear me!
And of course, as always, because we just can't get rid of him, it's Dave.
Hello.
Thank you for watching!
Love, I just gotta have it, I believe
and...
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Here we are.
We, a little bit earlier than usual.
But that's the new game here, 6.30 to 9.30.
Because we're so bored and have nothing to do.
Yeah, we thought we'd share our boredom with the rest of you.
But I see that a lot of people caught on to it.
We've got a good amount of people on board right now.
Now Black Lab will burp the nations of the world.
Oh, Black Lab's going to do some burping for us?
Okay.
Um, no.
They're trying... The chat room... Oh, by the way, if you do want to join the chat room, it's super easy now because we have a brand new website.
Big thank you to SoCalKicks for helping out with that.
We are of you.
And we have a new chat thing on the website.
So just go to orangelounge.skie.cx Is it Java or Yava?
It's Yava.
Yava.
And Twen helped me out to figure out how we get a Java thing going.
So thank you to Twen, too.
Yes.
But I'm not going to kiss Twen.
No.
Oh, my phone's ringing.
My bad.
I'm not answering you on air, sorry.
That's my booty call.
Uh oh, Rob's got his booty call.
Whale.
So, the chat room right now, they're trying to get me to go to Vegas.
I think they want all of us to come to Vegas, really, to do a show on the road in Vegas.
Yeah, I know.
How are we going to... Well, I know that my buddy Irene, Rice Princess, she turned 21 this week, and now she's thinking about doing a Vegas trip.
Because it was supposed to be Reno this weekend.
We were all going to go to Reno.
Prostitution is legal in Vegas, right?
Prostitution is not legal in Vegas or Vegas County, I don't think.
But outside it is.
Sucks.
I'm sorry?
Isn't it legal in Nevada in general?
Yes, but certain cities have it.
There's like some big brothel that's right outside.
Mustang Ranch.
It's Mustang Ranch, man.
I remember the one time on Under Station Live, the show I used to do on Saturday nights, we actually called the Bunny Ranch and got an interview with some prostitutes at the Bunny Ranch.
It was great radio.
Maybe once we get that capability set up here, we can...
You want to interview some prostitutes, Jamie?
Sure.
What's it like to be a whore?
You are a whore, darling.
Speaking of whores, I made Jamie watch the best movie about Vegas that's ever been made.
Showgirls.
The motion picture.
Three hours of stripping crap.
It's so bad.
That's why it is fun to watch because it is so freaking horrible.
What's our folks from Saved by the Bell?
Jesse Spano was her... Well, it's Elizabeth Berkley is her real name, but she was Jesse Spano on Saved by the Bell.
She was most famous in one episode, which... Spazzy, I don't know if he's listening right now, but he was trying to send me an episode of this, and it's been sending, like, all night long.
He was sending me an episode of Saved by the Bell when Jesse has her caffeine pill addiction, and she breaks down.
I'm so excited!
I'm so excited!
I'm so scared!
Nobody else here watched Saved by the Bell?
Nobody.
You did, yes.
I knew somebody else here had to have seen it.
I used to be an avid Saved by the Bell fan when I was on TV, and then Saved by the Bell at college years, and then Saved by the Bell at the movies.
Okay, that's a little much.
You're a dork.
Shut up!
Because Zack's so dreamy.
It's like, Loki's a dork.
Who's running a radio station out of his house?
Hey, fuck you.
Not me.
I'm just visiting.
You're here, bastard.
That's all I have to say.
Yeah, there.
We got people in the chat room admitting that they used to watch that show.
I didn't watch Saved by the Bell because I think I was busy watching cartoons.
What cartoons were you watching instead of Saved by the Bell?
Saved by the Bell came on after all the cartoons.
I was taping Ronin Warriors in the morning while I was still asleep and then watching my tape when I got home in the afternoon after I watched all my other shows.
Well, aren't you special?
Yes, I am, quite.
Ah, Saved by the Bell, Tiffany Amber Thiessen.
Her debut.
Nah, Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, yes.
She was hot.
Now she's, like, stupid.
What show is she on now?
She's on some show on Fox, isn't she?
She was on, like... She was on 90210.
Yeah.
And now she's, like, in bit parts in B-movies and stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, I don't like to acknowledge the Ducks to Dunks sequel.
I mean, okay, okay.
Now, granted, number two did have Bruce Campbell in, so that made number two decent.
Ha!
I have to see that, then.
Bruce Campbell was in Sacramento last week, by the way.
What?
Yes, Bruce Campbell did a signing at Borders or something.
I just heard about it, like, last minute.
That's all right.
We saw him when he went to the crest and did, uh... Nah.
We saw Evil Dead.
There he is.
My friend has himself on videotape with Bruce Campbell at E3.
What was Bruce Campbell doing at E3?
Just because he's Bruce Campbell.
All right.
Well, we saw him when he was down at the Crust Theater, and it was pretty cool because he was doing signings and stuff.
And then they did a screening of Evil Dead 2, you know, Dead by Dawn, which was great.
Great movie.
It's really fun to watch in a theater full of people, especially people I've seen the movie before, because everyone's just all cheering at the right spots, you know.
And he's like, bullshit.
And everyone's like, yeah!
Yeah!
Why can't we get a screening of Showgirls at the Crest with, like, Elizabeth Berkley live and the chick who played the mama at the strip bar who had the... She'd go like that and her top would fly off and she was really ugly.
She can bump on... Oh, no, not the big fat chick.
I'm talking Elizabeth Berkley.
Hey, if we want to recreate... Elizabeth Berkley looks like a skank.
Ew.
Looks like my sister.
Quacks like a duck, must be a duck.
You don't care.
You can put a paper bag on her head.
Hey, don't ruin it.
Make, Edit, Get Porn
and you send that edit to me in any form.
I mean, you can make the edit with a Japanese version of, you know, a DDR game that happens to have the same song that, you know, is in DDR Max USA.
DWI, you make an .sm file, just some way to get step chart, some way to get it to me and then, you know, I'll take care of the rest and send you out a big box of porn.
That's how it works.
I tried proposing this to the DDR Maniacs forums and they just didn't get it.
They're all...
I like the idea of an edit contest, but why porn?
Because I've done other edit contests before and they're like, but why porn?
Because everything else has been done.
Yo, can you do a normal edit?
I want boys.
Well, sorry, I don't have that.
We will find a way to maybe donate some boy porn to the contest.
We'll see if we can figure something out.
We don't know if we'll have DVDs necessarily, but we'll get boy porn in one way or another.
Just for the ladies, okay?
All right, well, anyways.
Oh, go ahead, Dave.
Instead of, like, getting boy porn for the winner, how about just donate boy porn to Jamie?
Because I don't think anyone else, including me, would want boy porn.
Now, now, we're neglecting some locals like Anita, DDRholic, Rice Princess.
I don't know.
There's folks out there that might want boy porn.
Who knows?
I don't get it.
If, you know, guys are, can talk about, you know, just all girl porn, you know, why can't we have our all boy porn?
I'm not saying that you can't.
I'm just saying that, well, would you want girl porn, like girl on girl, girl on girl action?
Because homosexuality is wrong and fags go to hell, but being a lesbian is okay.
I, I don't.
I don't find fake body parts okay to be that attractive.
I like seeing pretty boys with nice abs.
They're not fake, they're enhanced.
I'll have you know those are ab implants, okay?
Now, but anyways, if I got free guy porn, then sure, I'd throw in free guy porn, but I just get free girl porn, so that's what's going in the box.
But yeah, no one did understand why I was doing a contest to get porn.
I was like, because it's funny.
Because it's porn!
Because it's fun!
They're all, why don't you do a normal contest with regular prizes?
So first I kind of caved for about a minute, and I said, eh, fuck them.
You want a normal at a contest, go enter Turnham Mix 3 or whatever.
This is a pornographic edit contest.
It's called Make Edit Get Porn, not Make Edit Get Something Not Porn.
I should have made that rule that all the titles for the edits have to be sexually ambiguous.
P-E-R-0-N.
Prawn.
If JB wins it, he'll try to deep fry it and you'll have deep fried prawn.
No, but seriously, there'll be quite a bit of stuff in this box here.
That might be the slight problem, though.
Obviously, this contest is only open for anyone of age that can view porn in your state or county.
As long as, if you enter, I'm assuming that you're of age and that you're... Or convincing enough to lie about it.
Yes, if you enter, I am assuming that you're of age.
Do not tell me otherwise.
It's don't ask, don't tell.
If you cannot have pornography mailed to your house, don't enter.
Remember, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.
Yes, and we're not talking about a little bit of porn.
We're talking a lot of porn.
So, this is going to... We'll arrange, you know, transportation of the porn to your house, but...
We'll arrange a nice brown paper bag.
Yes.
Like, not a little bit of porn, like a whole two and a half days worth of porn.
That's a lot.
It will paint a little green door on the package.
Anyways, yeah, so the contest is still on, I have no entrance yet, but I haven't even announced a date for it, so... So, I mean, you know, whenever, I'll think of a date.
In the meantime, just get your edits ready and...
Even though a lot of people aren't entering, like, haven't signed up or whatever for entering, I know that there is a lot of hype going on, especially within the Sakpamani forums, about people wanting to enter this, such as Orange Beanie and me and other people.
This isn't restricted just to Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento.
It's everybody.
Nationwide.
International.
International.
If you live in Belgium and you want prawn, enter.
As long as you have the right region for your DVD player, or a good hack.
Oh yeah, that's a good point though, because they're all U.S.
region DVDs.
You don't have to actually limit it to the continental United States.
What about Canada?
It's just that it gets a little expensive to ship stuff to other countries.
Oh, that's true.
Continental U.S.
then only.
Continental U.S., yes.
Maybe, if somebody internationally wants to enter, maybe we'll just send you some net porn.
We'll send you a few dirty pictures.
I'll arrange something, yeah, for those who can't do that.
I actually found, you know, this is really sad, is someone made a Nintendo 64 emulated porn.
A Nintendo 64 porn?
What is that, Mario Party or something?
No, it's just like, I don't know, it's like they made a ROM file with porn in it.
It's weird.
Wahoo.
They have those for Super Nintendo.
There's like 30 pictures in them.
I downloaded this ROM that was labeled as this game I wanted and it was porn.
Cool.
It was like big, you know, twat shot porn.
Ew.
I don't...
Need to see pixelated cooter, okay?
Plus they had an option.
I guess what it does is it activates the rumble pack for a very long time.
It has the vibrate function.
So that was really weird, but yeah.
It's out there.
You have no idea how many times I, like, click on something for Kazaa, and it's like, Initial D, episode 22.
Click on, oh, oh, wait, that's not Initial D, that looks like porn.
Not Initial D. Yeah, that pissed me off.
I was trying to find Jackass, the movie, and I ended up getting Sorority Boys.
Yeah, then you see the male ass.
I was like, no!
Of course, I'm downloading Chamber of Secrets right now, because I didn't get to go today.
Oh, you and your Harry Potter.
Speaking of porn.
Just kidding.
Speaking of porn, Harry Potter, come on.
I got lost.
Although I do know where to get to, didn't you?
How was Harry Potter anyway?
Very, very good.
Really?
We're planning on having a trip again to go see it sometime very soon if you want to come and join in on the action.
Yeah, sure.
Lots of me drooling over Alan Rickman on screen.
Yay, Alan Rickman on screen.
God, he was so fabulous.
But I don't think of him as fabulous like that.
Yeah, Harry Potter.
Word.
Oh, speaking of... Go from porn to Harry Potter.
Speaking of pornography, no, I have something that still goes along the lines of pornography.
This has kind of been circulating a lot of the web boards this week.
We've been given this link that talks about the DDR up the skirt camera.
I don't know if you guys, I'll post the link in the chat room for those that maybe haven't seen this, although I think it's been whored out on just about every forum out there.
Not to mention at least five live journals.
Yeah, like different live journals and such.
But just in case, there's the link in the chat room for you guys.
It's basically a pornography where it shows these Japanese schoolgirls, of course they're dressed like Catholic schoolgirls, you wouldn't have it any other way.
Sailor dresses.
Yeah, they all look like Sailor Moon.
and there's a little camera right in the center of a DDR pad that films up their skirt.
They even have a diagram illustrating where the camera is.
Yeah, it just points out, you know, insert camera here.
It's a big black dot.
Now, we should translate this page, shouldn't we?
I should run this through the translator because I haven't done that yet.
Let's see.
What do you guys think of this while I get it translated?
It has to do it really well, and...
I don't think it's really that working.
Let's see.
This is the English translation of the website.
Should we do some reading of the English translation of the website here?
Go for it.
Alright, I'm trying to get some website reading music here.
Yeah, but I just don't see how, like...
I mean, I can think of that you could hide the camera pretty well, but how many girls wear, like, mini skirts in play?
I don't think I've ever seen a girl wear a skirt or a mini skirt in play.
All right, let's hear what this porn cam site's advertising here.
Meanwhile, we have, like, the guys all ogling at the screen.
Make It Wait, ah, carried out.
A Playwoman quantity student's lower half of the body, collection of images of a shock.
The fourth cartridge, a ban, is removed at last.
This time it photographs before the first game in series and photography is ventured.
What surrender women quantity student with sufficient super qua?
Lump, T-Back, Photography, a success!
Let's hear it for Nifty at Global Gate.
The woman quantity students aimed at this time total six sets.
It clicks on each lower photograph and is to a verification page.
I don't know if that's like letting me view.
Oh, close-ups!
Look, it's... Oh, ass!
Let's see.
K.O.
are the women who show splendid dancing, like, while swaying the flair.
Well, we can tell it... It seems to be the dance of a proposal of marriage completely.
Okay, well, let me just put it this way.
They haven't been playing DDR very long, so they got some serious roles in that ass.
People like to be...
The whiter panties to the upper one of the leg extended smoothly, which seemed to be warm.
It is a fortunate shot.
Is it noticed that a camera is... Japanese.
Exciting moment.
She's looking right down at the camera.
A Supa Mini and loose exquisite balance and snow white panties cannot be removed too!
You wanna hear something very ironic about this whole thing?
There's no way that they wouldn't show anything other than a panty shot because it's illegal to show anything like that in Japan in the first place.
It totally blurs out.
Doesn't this look like a cooter right there?
Like this chick's not wearing underwear?
But is it just the lighting?
No, I can't click on it.
Let's see, I'm trying to look at more verification page.
See if we can see some... Oh, I don't know.
It's just white panties everywhere.
So it doesn't say how to order.
Does it?
Let me click on one of these.
Let's see how we order one.
Why?
Because we want to see how much they cost.
We're going to have one shipped to your house.
No!
Let's see.
It's loading.
No, it's not giving me shit.
Why would you want shit?
Oh well.
What are you pointing at?
Oh, the link.
Oh, it's a Shockwave file.
I don't know what I'm going to get.
Let's see.
Okay, so that's enough of that.
Let's click on this Shockwave file I've been getting.
So, any chance we'll ever see a series like this in America?
Panty Panty Revolution?
I don't know about that, but I'm sure they could put the Girls Gone Wild chicks on there, jumping around.
Just take a DDR machine and Mardi Gras.
and let fun ensue.
I see prophets!
Anyways.
I have no idea what this is that I just got in the chatroom.
It's a fish with legs.
It's a fish with legs and it's speaking a lot of Japanese.
He has a fish for a head and he's wearing a loincloth and a cape.
Kikkoman!
Yeah, it's like a soy sauce.
Yes, they can.
Did he just shoot a laser out of his nipple?
There's a kitty eating a fried egg.
Show me, show you, show me, show you Show me, show you, show you, show me
They look like little kittens.
They look like fried kittens.
Did you just say pussy?
Number one soy sauce.
What the hell?
Yikes.
Oh, somebody hung the kitten.
How sad.
That was homoerotic right there.
That was brawn right there.
A banana, a mushroom, and a fish.
Ice cream popsicle.
See, isn't that homoerotic right there?
That was beautiful.
I'm inspired to go eat sushi now.
Suggestion in the chatroom.
They should make Douche Douche Revolution.
What else is the chatroom saying?
Strip Strip Revolution.
Girls Gone Wild DDR.
Lose a song, take your top off.
Strip DDR.
You probably have to get the girls drunk first.
Actually, I was talking to someone that, uh, used to know the people that did the Girls Gone Wild, uh, tapes, and, yeah, that's what they do, is get them drunk first.
Uh, Jamie, uh, we're getting a suggestion about maybe boy porn for the DDR, same thing.
You never know when guys might be free-balling and wearing baggy shorts, so... Ooh!
Pantsless rage indeed.
Don't you think they'd be able to feel the breeze a little bit?
It's like DDR-ing in the nude, Jesus.
Wouldn't it be painful?
I would think so.
How would it be painful?
Floppy, floppy, floppy.
If you're a woman and you have big boobs, you'd be whacking yourself in the face.
Once, me and Pauliver, one of the first times I played, I went down to the Riptide Arcade, the old one.
Before it was the Riptide Arcade or whatever.
The old place in Pier 39, before it moved.
And there was this one girl who was playing and her boobs were bouncing up and down so much.
She was like Jiggle Jiggle Revolution, I think we called it.
I need to go throw up now.
I think I saw a freestyle like that the other day.
I need to go throw up a lot now.
Are we going to take a quick break and come back?
Yeah, let's take a quick break.
Okay, we're going to take a really quick break and we'll come right back.
And when we come back, we'll get off the pornography subject.
Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah right.
And we'll talk to Black Lab a little more because he's our special guest.
So we have to interview him while he's here.
So I'm going to get to a request that we had in the chat room a little bit earlier.
This is from 2DX8Style.
It's a super special secret stage at Xenon right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
and many more.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!

That's the genre Oh, it's the genre, sorry, my bad All the MP3s I got for Poppin' Music are from Feeling Pumo Oh, my bad
I don't know why they call it that.
Well, we had an email request for more poppin' music last week that we read on the show.
Now you can't say we don't listen to our emailers.
If you want to email us, just drop us a line at orangelaunchradio at yahoo.com.

Yeah, Pomu is pop and music.
Pomu.
Pop music.
Get it?
I get it.
Still sounds vaguely... Click, click, click, click, ding.
...vaguely twatty.
Did you just say it sounds twatty?
Yes, I did!
If you're just now joining us, a friendly reminder, Orange Lounge Season 2 debuted tonight, and we start the show a half hour earlier now.
And we run it a half hour later.
Is that on?
Which means it's three hours long.
No, the webcam is on.
Okay, because people would be looking at my feet right now.
The big show starts now at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.
So wake up earlier.
Yes.
Get your ass here earlier.
Hi, Black Lab.
How are you?
Let's talk to Black Lab.
It's our favorite puppy.
Yeah.
Good puppy.
Sit.
Sit, Ubu, sit.
I'm already on the ground, dammit.
Yes, because you can't have my chair.
Black Lab's already sitting here on his knees.
Don't go there!
Don't go there.
Yes?
Yes.
I had my experience working at Castro Valley Golf Land and I know it's small and I know it's probably most people consider it ghetto because Milpitas and Sunnyvale are much bigger.
Living in the ghetto.
It's not really ghetto, it's more like, well, it's Castro Valley.
It's like a white and partially Latino hood.
Okay.
And it's up in the hills.
It's not like down in the city area.
It's not even a real city, though.
So, what kind of Bomani games do they have in Castro Valley?
Oh, we have the usual standard Max 2s.
Oh, we have a 3rd Korean, yeah!
Don't see many of those anymore.
And then we also have a 4th Plus.
Oh yeah, a US version of Guitar Freaks and a Beat Stage 5th Mix.
With a discolored screen, I might add.
What exactly did you used to do at Castro Adolfo?
You weren't a tech, you just...
I was general maintenance.
I made sure the place didn't collapse on itself.
Now, were you there for the big tournament they did at Caster Valley a couple months ago?
Oh, yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
Most people probably don't know this.
If it weren't for me, that whole thing would have fallen flat on its frickin' face.
Oh, I see.
Ego, ego.
No, I'm serious though.
I was like the main link to the management and it kind of got screwed over at the last minute without my knowledge because I was trying to make sure that the machine would be going outside for the tournament.
But no, the manager changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to tell anyone until the next morning.
When I'm there an hour before the place even opens to get this machine moved outside and the supervisor that morning comes in and is like,
Oh, the machine's not going outside.
And I'm like, oh shit.
And I pretty much damn near killed myself trying to make sure there was enough room for people to be in there, and I ended up missing pretty much the entire tournament because I had a migraine from nearly killing myself.
Ouch.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And then I had to come and clean up after you bastards!
I didn't go, so you didn't clean up after me.
And why didn't we have any fucking music playing during that?
That's not really as fuck you.
That's not really as fuck you.
That's as fuck you of like three months ago.
That's not the fuck you of this week.
We'll get to those later.
Post-dated FU.
Well, you have to catch up.
You usually send about ten FUs of the week every week, so.
Well, it's been kind of going down lately.
You're getting a little happier with life.
A little.
But so now you've moved from Castro Valley to the wide, wonderful... I didn't live in Castro Valley.
I lived in San Leandro, which is like... Which is right nearby, obviously, if you were to Castro Valley, right, okay.
But you've moved basically to Sacramento.
You don't live in Sacramento, but you live in the People's Republic of Davis, which is a small hippie town just, you know, right outside of Sacramento.
With a college!
Oh, wow.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
Abandon hope I have.
So how does Davis differ than the Bay Area for you?
It's full...
You get a fine for breathing.
Davis, by the way, the town that arrested the lady for snoring too loud, I think.
Wasn't that Davis?
I didn't hear anything about Davis.
That was years ago.
It was probably before you were born.
Pretty little flat college town with absolutely nothing in it.
And it's boring as hell.
And the college sucks because they aren't letting first year students have their cars when there's plenty of parking.
And I'm hating it.
and Calamari
Yeah, it would be shrimp too, but they ran out of the shrimp there.
It's sad, but... But it's a max one there, and it's like, the volume's not that loud, and... Yeah.
So how did you get into playing DDR?
Was it something... Were you working at CBGL before Bomani got big and they got the game one day?
No, I... Listen, it was almost two years ago when I started, when I actually first played DDR.
Where did you first play DDR?
At Caster Valley Golf Land, as a matter of fact.
Oh, okay.
All right.
I just played the USA mix there and failed, stomped to my beat on my first song, and yeah, I was pretty much hooked after that.
And I've lost many hours and many 20s since then.
And now, you didn't get the job at Golfland so you could play more free DDR, did you?
Because that's sad.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, I needed a tour.
I knew people that were there, and they knew me, and it made it easier to get a job there for a summer job to get money to go to college.
I mean, the free only $20 in tokens every two weeks that I got wasn't that big.
But hey, at least I got to play some stuff.
Yeah.
Cool.
Alright, that's Black Lab, everybody.
Yay.
Alright.
So, what do we talk about now?
We gotta fill three hours in this bitch.
This is the moment on Orange Lounge where we yodel.
Give the mic to Loki, he's got something to say.
Has anyone out there seen that show, um, Three South?
Three South?
No, what station's that on?
MTV.
No, I don't watch crap.
I broke the clip again.
Okay, anyways, no, it's this really cool cartoon.
Do you want the clip or the mic?
I want the clip.
Anyways, so it's this really pretty funny show, actually.
It's the new cartoons they have on there, and it's about these three college guys, and from what I gathered, they're pretty retarded.
SoCalKick says it's stupid.
I watched it.
It was funny.
Your opinion counts for Jack.
Anyways.
So, it was pretty funny.
Today's episode is about constructing the Stomach Pump 2000.
Right.
Is that like Sorority Life, but animated?
With less bitching and no hot chicks.
Sorority Life was set in Davis.
That's something Davis is famous for.
Yeah, now we know publicly that there's plenty of bitches in, uh, fucking Davis Yeah, and that really helps me a lot Uh-huh Yeah I'm sorry to interrupt, you were talking about some crappy show on MTV?
It was entertaining, okay?
I mean, I had fun watching it.
I now know it's on Thursdays.
It gives me something to watch on Thursdays before I'm waiting for, I don't know, the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
Now that's quality television.
That show owns.
I love that show.
I don't know where the pin is.
I lost the pin.
I broke the clip again.
Didn't you think some of the older animated shows on MTV were much better, though?
Like Beavis and Butthead, Aeon Flux, Liquid Television that brought birth to both of those two shows.
Yes.
Because that rocked.
Frog Baseball Ciffle and Ollie
I've never heard of that.
Oh my god, it was the shit.
I think it's still online somewhere.
I just, I haven't followed up on it.
It was a show that did all of two shows of this on MTV.
The Idiot Box with Alex Winter, as in Bill and Ted Fane.
Ah.
I just remember the one show where he got shot in the head at the beginning of it.
And so the whole episode he was bleeding.
And he didn't realize it until he reaches up to scratch his head and then he goes, Ah, I'm bleeding!
And dies.
Well, then there was those two other shows that we probably want to forget about.
The State.
The State.
Oh, The State was like the best.
Okay, sorry.
I'm talking about animated shows.
We're talking like The Head.
I liked The Head.
I liked The Head.
Fuck you.
She likes Head.
Anyways, and then there's also The Max.
The Max was cool, too.
I like when they were talking about the Izzes, the ones that were just like, I think it was the Izzes, the stupid slugs that would jump like 50 feet in the air and then couldn't land.
They'd jump and just splat.
It was cool.
You know what we need an animated series of?
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
Well, we have Zim.
Oh, fuck that, dude.
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac would be awesome.
Maybe later.
Like Little Shorts of Happy Noodle Boy.
Just Happy Noodle Boy would even be good.
The chatroom, Vandalist in the chatroom is asking, does anybody remember a show on Nickelodeon called Turkey Television?
Barely.
I barely remember it too.
I remember not liking it.
I remember the name, but like, barely anything about it.
I used to watch Out of Control.
Was that the one that the guy went cut it out?
Was that?
Yeah, in a head.
Yes.
Diz.
Yes.
The one that looked like Cyndi Lauper.
She would tell her story.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, that show was the shit.
And the guy looked like Mark Summer from Double Dare, but it wasn't.
Yes.
I know what you're talking about.
It was the guy from Full House.
He did the cut it out.
Yeah.
I hella remember that show.
And I remember seeing Atlantis.
As long as we're reminiscing about old school TV.
And Pinwheel.
What else are they talking about here?
Funhouse with J.D.
Ross, man.
That show was awesome.
That show fucking ruled.
I had a computer game of Funhaus.
That was the shit.
I was actually looking up stuff about Funhaus this week, and they had a J.D.
Ross fan club, and man, talk about that guy being fucking homo.
That guy was like a homo pedophile, I swear to God.
He's sending photos of him just all sprawled out for children to enjoy.
As Loki's imitating the pictures here in the corner of the room.
That guy was sad.
That guy was really sad.
I mean, he was like one step below Vanilla Ice.
And just horrible.
I remember that show, but remember that J.D.
Roth was also the host of GameProTV.
Well, I just brought this show to a screeching halt with that name.
No.
I have to say, though, that Funhaus was awesome.
It was kind of funny, though, because some of the prizes that they had to get, they had to stick to their head with, like, Velcro.
It was like they'd have giant, like, boxes with the brand new Nintendo system, so they'd just, you know, stick that to their head, and they'd have to run out, and they'd get, like, cash and money and prizes and shit, and it was awesome.
That show was awesome.
Ah, you'll appreciate this one, Jamie.
I know you knew this show.
Skyline's asking if you remember a show called Out of This World.
Yes.
It was, ding, you put your fingers together and... Okay, in my live journal, one of my old icons was Troy, her dad, in his prismatic thingam-thingy.
The show, the 280 shows I remember, because they used to be on back-to-back.
Small Wonder, thank you very much.
That show was the shit.
With Vicky.
And the girl I used to actually have a crush on, Punky Brewster.
Punky Brewster was cool.
Soleil Moon Frye.
Dude, did you hear Soleil Moon Frye had to get a boob job?
She got her boobs reduced because they were so big.
I just couldn't believe that, that Punky Brewster had big tits.
Because, you know, when you saw her, she had no tits.
Because she was five or something.
Twelve, you know.
It doesn't matter.
You know, speaking, we've kind of been talking about game shows and TV shows.
Did you ever hear those rumors a while back that they were filming a pilot for a Dance Dance Revolution game show, which has to be the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my entire life.
A load of crap.
Exactly.
It's even a bad joke.
You know, that took off about as well as, uh, the DDR movie?
It was the DDR Freak movie, remember?
Yes, it was a movie called DDR Freak.
I've seen the supposed script for it, and it was bull and shit at the same time.
Was that the script that started at Milpitas Golf Land?
Because that was faker than Elizabeth Berkley's moves.
I tried...
Who wrote that again?
I'm pretty sure it was one of the South Bay folks, but I don't know.
I actually tried at the time to get the script for it.
However, the only way you can get... Was it... I think it was...
I'm sure it's somebody that's now banned from DDR Freak.
And for writing that piece of crap, you deserved it.
I'm just kidding.
I actually, I tried getting the script at the time when that was like the big news, you know, it was the stupid DDR Freak movie.
Right.
But the only problem was, the only way you could get a script of the movie is if you were a member of this casting group or whatever.
You know, I almost wanted to sign up for that just because I wanted to know.
I wanted to know how fake this shit was.
Someone posted the whole script on DDR Freak.
You could just go click the link and get it.
Really?
I thought it was fake, though.
It was in a thread.
The supposed script, it was on there.
Interesting.
Yeah, well, it was crap, and, yeah.
I would have liked to see it made, I mean, because I've, to be honest, I've seen worse made, and it's actually sold.
I think they could make a DDR movie, but not that group that was trying to do it.
I mean, you don't, what, what the fuck did you do, pay money to be in a movie?
Let me, let me go over a couple.
You have to pay money to audition, that's lame.
A couple actual movies that are out here.
Let's just see here.
Spectrum Entertainment, they're an awesome company that distributes just anything that they get their hands on.
And I mean anything.
Let's see, we've got Ankle Biters, the old midget vampire movie.
That one's great.
We have one that's called Night Chills.
It's about...
About, um, this guy that plays Dungeons and Dragons And then all of a sudden, like, people are getting killed that play Dungeons and Dragons By this guy that's dressed up like a giant knight in an armor suit thing It's crap And then there's another one called Envy Full title, Penis Envy It's about these two chicks that are wandering through the desert And just decide, you know what?
Our lives would be a lot better if we had penises So what happens?
This giant drag queen fairy Just, uh, the penis fairy goes
Oh, you all have penises now!
And it's like a couple hours of them just like doing shit with their penises and growing mustaches and it's just really nasty shit and at the very end of the movie they make a trip down to L.A.
to meet the penis fairy again and to get it removed and it ends in tragedy as like one of the girls gets shot and killed and
I just really didn't care.
There's no plot to the movie at all other than what would happen if two white trash hookers got penises and started running around screwing the white trash redneck locals there and yada yada yada yada.
And like for some reason no one notices that they're chicks with mustaches with giant dicks.
Did they have boobs too?
They had boobs and dicks?
Yeah, that would appear and disappear at will.
It's like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I actually have a collection of the worst movies known to man.
I actually go out of my way to find these movies and buy them.
The next two movies that have been sent to me are Feeders 2, rated 1, the lowest rated movie ever watched on SomethingAwful.com.
So I'm getting that movie.
Don't forget Manos, The Hands of Fate.
Oh, God.
That movie is so bad.
It put me to sleep watching it on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.
It was so bad that Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch it.
It was awful.
And then there was also, what other ones did we get?
Of course, Wild Zero was pretty bad.
That Japanese rock and roll punk.
It was a punk rock zombie alien movie with some chick that was a guy.
Weird shit.
I don't know.
What other movies did I watch that were really crappy?
Let me see here.
We had one, he came from Planet K. I had one really funny part in it where the alien walked up to this guy who got shot, picked up his gun, shot him in the leg, healed his leg, shot him in his leg again, healed his leg, shot him in the leg again.
That was just hilarious at the time.
So now what's your plan?
How are we going to convince this company that they need to make a DDR movie?
You just made it to them.
They're all, it's done?
Okay, we'll take it.
Well, so are we going to have to have Jamie star in the movie and, like, grow a dick?
No.
Do we have to do some stunts like that?
Use Twin.
I think you need some, like, upskirt panty cam stuff going there.
Maybe a zombie just for kicks.
Maybe some topless chicks.
And an exploding toilet.
And people who can't act to save their life.
Oh, yeah.
Dude, so we should all star in it.
Dude, they should make DDR Freak the porno.
Dude, you could cast like a bunch of hot Japanese chicks just playing DDR and having sex on the pad.
DDR Freak?
No, no.
DDR Freak and hot Japanese people are not like two things that can be used in the same sense.
Fine.
Ah, DDR sex freaks or something like that.
There you go.
First of all, there's already hentai art done involving a dance pad that I've, like, seen one picture because someone posted it somewhere.
I have not had the urge to go look for it, but I know it exists.
Why does it seem like all of our conversations seem to stray back to porn?
That's alright.
Gets ratings.
I just don't know what it is.
Hansel Strange, 3-2-9-E.
But yeah, there was some really bad movies.
There was one that was like an American vampire, and that was with Carmen Electra.
And she was like some vampire, and then there was even, they actually had a part in this movie, a track that you can listen to, that was making fun of the movie.
It was so bad.
They had a track, an audio track, where people were making fun of the movie.
I was just like, okay.
Interesting.
Well, I think we need to make that our mission, is we need to make an actual DDR movie.
Orange Lounge, the motion picture.
How about it?
Let's break out the 8mm cam.
Jamie, take off your top.
No, Rob.
It's for artistic purposes.
No, Rob.
No.
I have yo-yo.
Man, if only I hadn't gotten rid of my hooker hook up there, man.
I could have, like... Wait, you knew a hooker or something?
Well, we can go into this story.
Oh, God.
All right.
Why not?
We got three hours to film now.
Okay.
This is a story of how I accidentally met a hooker.
And one can say, accidentally, how does one accidentally meet a hooker?
Well, it's quite interesting, actually.
And here's how it goes.
Okay, one day I decided, you know, I took a Friday off and I needed to get my hair cut because, you know, it kind of gets long sometimes.
So I got my hair cut and everything, and this is during the summer once.
You just got a haircut or you got them all cut?
Worst joke ever.
Anyway.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and, um, this, it looks like, I swear to God, she was, she couldn't have been that old, she, I thought it was a high school student, and looked like her little brother, so I, so they, so she's like, can we get a ride down the street to our apartment?
She was in high school, I swear!
I swear, well, that's what I thought it was, and they're like, it's kind of hot out here, can we get a ride down to our apartment?
I'm like, where do you guys live?
Oh, just Creekside.
I was like, oh, okay, because there's a couple blocks down the street.
So that was fine, so they got in the car, and so I couldn't quite make the left to go to Creekside, which was two blocks, so I had to go around the block.
So, you know, we go around the block and stuff, and her kid, you know, who I found out was her son, you know, was playing around in the backseat because I had a bunch of anime movies back there and stuff, and she was talking to me, and she kept hitting on me.
She's all, she's all, so, what are you doing later?
Do you want, do you want to go out tonight?
Stuff like that.
Hey, baby.
Stuff like that.
And I was like, I'm all, now I got a girlfriend, you know, I, I'm,
I'm actually, you know, we're going out later and stuff, so I took her back to her place, and she's all, she's all, can I give you gas money?
Yeah, Loki has a girlfriend that hates DDR.
Yeah, I'm just messing with you.
Oh no, no, she'll play DDR, just when I'm not there.
She played it like once in Tahoe, and, well anyways, back to the story, with the hooker.
So, so she...
I take her back to her apartment and she's like, here, let me give you gas money.
I'm like, no, that's fine.
Wait, so a hooker was going to pay you?
She was going to pay me for gas money to give her a ride to her house.
Oh, right, gas money.
Gas money, yes.
I refused the gas money because it was only... I refused the gas money because it was only... You were being a good Samaritan.
I was being a good Samaritan.
It was only a few blocks and it was like... You were helping your fellow hooker.
I was...
I didn't know she was a hooker, okay?
We haven't gotten to the part where I figured out she was a hooker.
Right now I thought she was some... Now she was?
SoCalKick says she needed to fill up.
Hey, she was... Okay, she was pretty hot, okay?
And she was... I thought she was just some really desperate single mom who wanted some action or some shit like that.
Who happened to look like she was in high school.
At the time, yeah, she looked pretty young, so, I mean, I placed her anywhere from, like, 17 to 20, low 20 range, so, I'm not good with age.
Shit, man, now with age, I mean, fucking 12-year-olds look like 16-year-olds, so what am I supposed to judge?
Anyway, how'd you find out she was younger?
Okay, so, I refused my answer, she's like, here, you want a soda?
So, I was like, okay, so, I went into her apartment, probably mistake number one here.
Whoops!
Yeah, oh, you were forced in at gunpoint into her apartment.
I was not forced!
I wanted that damn soda, okay?
Oh, you wanted to taste the sweet juice, yes.
So, went to her apartment, phone rang right when we got in there, so... Actually, it was kind of weird because I didn't quite realize it at first, but she had told her son to go play because mommy was working or something like that, and I was like, huh?
So...
Anyway, so we went to the apartment, I got, no, I got the soda, and she was, you know, the phone rang, so I just sat down drinking soda, and then, like, midway out of, like, fucking nowhere, because I guess it was her mom on the phone, she just, like, puts her hand over the phone, walks up to me, and she's like, do you want a blowjob?
I'm like...
Uh, no.
What kind of man are you?
You know, I should have, but I said no, that's morally wrong.
You should have said, yes, I want a blowjob, but not from you, you skanky whore.
So anyways, so I said no.
She got off the phone.
She kind of explained to me how she was working.
She thought I was like afraid that she was a cop or something.
So she, you know, pulls down her shirt to show me her tits and says, you know.
Oh, that would have gone nice.
Yeah.
So there was some gratification in that.
Oh, yeah.
Got a nice brush.
A reward.
A reward, I guess.
But no, she was just trying to prove to me that she wasn't wired or some shit like that.
And
So I was like, uh, no, that's really alright, no, so, and this is where I probably should have just said, fuck it, I'm leaving, yeah, just get me the hell out of here.
But you got to see some titties, so now you were kind of wondering what's going to happen next.
Yes, but, okay, so now, so I was just like, okay, no, I can't do that, so, so she's like, okay, well, can I ask you another favor?
I'm like, alright, what?
She's like, I need a ride down to Ranja, so I was like...
Okay, fine, because that's on my way home, so I was going to give her a ride down to Rancho for some reason.
Okay, so we go down 50, and during the way she's, you know, talking to me and shit, and she's like, you know, still trying to push the hole, she wants to give me a blowjob thing.
Okay.
I mean, Ray, after refusing so many times, you'd think I'd say yes, but just for some reason, I still said no.
And so, she started explaining the whole basic business structure of prostitution, which is quite interesting, actually.
Was she talking about her boss?
No, actually, she was the pimp.
It's quite weird.
It was a really strange infrastructure she's got going there.
She basically finds, you know, it's really easy to become pink.
You just gotta basically find women there walking around.
They'll know where they're going or what.
They'll look lost and stuff.
You just say you'll take care of them.
They can make lots of money and that kind of shit.
Right now I was kind of tuning around listening to the radio.
Then she started talking about how she had a bunch of apartments in different places and stuff like that.
I took her to Rancho and she saw some other hooker walking around.
A hooker buddy.
She wanted me to come get this hooker to be my hooker.
I'd be the pimp for this hooker.
I'm like, no, that's alright.
I'm all...
I'm all, I'm all, I gotta, and then she wanted to give me her pager number, so in case I had any friends.
Now, I, I thought about... Like, refer a friend to the wonderful world of whoredom.
Oh, exactly, and I get a cut off the top, you know?
I was like, I was like, maybe not, you know, that, no.
So then she got on my car finally, and that's why I sped off and went back home.
Okay, now, the question about all this.
How the fuck does this have anything to do with Bomani?
Okay.
Did we actually talk about Imani all day?
Oh shit, we're almost halfway through the show and we haven't talked about Imani.
Oh boy, okay.
Well, anything else to add to your little wonderful wide world of whoredom story there?
She also thought that I didn't want to blowjob her because she was black.

Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
You're listening to Porringe Lounge Radio, as somebody in the chat room referred to it earlier.
It's porntastic.
It's fat-tastic.
Makes my mouth water.
Where we don't talk about Pomani ever on this program.
That's just a side show.
To DDR.
Ha ha ha.
Not here.
Yeah.
Anyway, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I know is Jamie's favorite segment, right?
Yeah.
Teehee.
Is this your favorite part of the show?
Yes?
One of them.
One of them.
I like the whole thing.
This is the FU of the week where Jamie just goes off on something that pisses her off and then we all play along.
We all talk about things that piss us off.
So, without further ado...
Jamie, what the hell is pissing you off this time?
First thing that pisses me off is the fact that I've been using the same version of Schlagwerk.
So I think in the future when we should use the, quote, terror mix.
Well then, get me an MP3 of the terror mix and we'll do the terror mix.
Easily done.
But now my real one goes toward the events that happened early this morning.
I was over here watching Showgirls.
You are a whore, darling.
Anyway, we were over here watching Showgirls.
We went live on the show, which was fun and random.
Yes, which we do occasionally, which is more incentive to listen to our Bomani Music Amore program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station.
We're in the show out.
Anyway, I get home.
I knew Dan was going to be having people over for that piece of shit Xbox Live crap.
I go in there and there's like everybody and God in my living room.
God was in your living room?
Well, no.
Amazing.
Because if God were there, he wouldn't be playing the Xbox.
Anyway.
He'd be too busy smiting people.
He'd be playing Animal Crossing, where everybody can be a god.
Anyway, I go, and there's just all these fucking people there.
And I'm exhausted.
So we go upstairs, we play some 2DX, and then Bailey will walk in and...
Ryan.
Black Lab.
I was tired.
Rise from your grave.
I was very hyper.
Did you see all that candy you ate?
No, it was actually caffeine.
What?
Anyway, this is my fuck you, so leave your candy out of it.
Anyway.
I go downstairs.
and say, okay, please guys, one last game.
Dan goes, no!
You knew we were going to be here.
How inconsiderate, you know?
I come home, and I'm tired.
Was it his time of the month?
Yeah, it must have been.
We had the Oriental Boa.
Anyway.
Anyway.
I know, it's one thing, I admit I came home late, and that's one thing.
I would have thought that they would have wrapped it up by then, or would have just wrapped it up.
You came home late out of consideration for the party, because you didn't want to see no stinking Xboxes, because they're just giant paperweights.
Instead I come home, and there's five TVs in my living room, and three Xboxes hooked up, and they're playing some stupid mecha ball game.
Mecha Balls?
No, like, you go to, like, the one, like, Capture the Five, you have a ball, and you have to kick the ball across.
It's really stupid.
They were playing with balls all night, basically.
And it was fucking loud.
You had a bunch of men in your living room playing with balls.
Yes.
Just checking.
So, I go upstairs and decide to make my icons, and I made, like, two Draco Malfoy ones.
I was like, this sucks.
So, this is what, you know, I thought that maybe he was going to be considerate and, you know, have everybody go home.
And then this is what I hear.
Okay, one more game.
Fuck!
I'm upstairs going, go home!
You heard me!
I was like, it's just, go home, get out of my house, I want to go to bed.
I would not have been able to go to bed with all of that bullshit going on.
And I was fucking tired.
Okay, I had been up all for a while.
You need to have your revenge.
You need to have people over.
You need to have people over for a gem marathon.
Yes.
No, I'll just have another good money party at the apartment.
How's that?
The last one we had, we had, what, 20 people showed up?
Yeah.
In my living room!
Which, you know, the living room, you know, it's probably, it's a two-bedroom, no, you only have really a one, no, you have a two-bedroom apartment.
I have a two-bedroom, but it's a two-story apartment.
Sort of like a townhouse, but not quite.
But anyway, you know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but it really pissed me off.
And he's like mad at me for being mad at him.
I'm like, huh?
Excuse me?
You know, I've gotten it out of my system now.
I want the whole world to know my displeasure.
I want all the Xbox balls to die.
A big thank you to Xbox for ruining Jamie's life.
Yeah, fuck you, Gates.
I hope you die.
May your brakes fail on the freeway and you go off of a cliff and land in a gigantic tank of sulfuric acid and dissolve slowly for hours until you finally die.
And then I hope your soul doesn't go to hell or doesn't go to heaven.
I hope you're stuck in purgatory where you're bored forever.
My, are you done ranting?
Are you finished?
I don't think so.
Excuse me, world!
This is my segment, hello.
You know, all of your little input is just, you know, consequence.
This is my segment.
Funny, you just had to, like, reset the little, uh, FU song, like, three times by now.
So you can keep ranting.
I'm the ranty bitch of the show, I'm allowed.
That's right, that's my role on the program.
Music bitch.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
This is just... Okay, I'm being seemed about it.
I've made several noises of displeasure.
Okay, breathe in, breathe out, do some yoga, drink some boba, feel better.
I get boba tonight.
This is a good fucking night.
Anyway, next!
Alright, moving along.
Loki!
Alright, how can you possibly follow up that porn story?
Okay.
Oh!
Let's see.
Well, I have to give a big FU to my cold, which is now gone, thank God.
But it lasted too long, and it was annoying, so thank God it's gone.
A big FU to the putters at Golf Land, because they keep chipping my shots.
Every time I hit the ball, it goes flying up in the air.
I have to add to that because they're like made crooked.
I swear to God they are.
I mean, I've looked at all of them when I worked there and if you actually hold the putter up and look at it, the faces are crooked.
You can't punch straight with those things.
They're made to fuck with you like that.
Yeah, see, they make the putters just like they make all of the clubs.
See, they go straight and then they turn so you can hit the ball.
But I think that you meant the shafts are crooked.
No one likes a crooked shaft.
Like, how's it hanging?
A little bent right now.
Crooked.
Small shrivels and two left.
That's actually a real, like, disorder.
And a crooked shaft.
Anyways, um, another FD goes to, uh...
Can I finish?
Can I finish?
Thank you!
No, play my music!
Now, um, another FU goes to Folsom Lake Bowl for being one of the most ghetto bowling alley, actually it's the only bowling alley in Folsom, but it's very ghetto.
In fact they have these things that are called
Little Homies.
So I bought one, it's a stupid little thing that comes in a bottle.
Oh, dude, the Homies dolls, I know what you're talking about.
They're cool.
So, I took one of those, and I took it to Golfland, and I wanted the homie to go down the rapids, because, you know, that's what the homie's gonna do when the ball is go down the fucking rapids.
So I threw him up in the fountain, and the fucking homie got stuck in the middle of the fountain, and the goddamn thing couldn't get it back, and my homie's gone!
So anyways, NFB to the fountain that stole my homie And uh, let's see
And on top of that, that would be the price for making me spend $200 there for putting stuff very cheap in a... They had 40-speed CD burners for $19 there.
How awesome is that?
I mean... It's a good brand.
Yeah.
Oh, verbatim.
It was pretty decent.
But I ended up buying a $129 one because of Yamaha.
And it burns these really cool disc tattoo things that you can't see on normal discs.
They tell you that in the manual, not on the outside of the box.
That kind of sucks.
Um, FD to me for buying two Saturns and Chords for one.
Because I bought one from Denios from this chick that couldn't speak English, but it was $10, so I was like, okay.
And then this other one was like $75 and came with games and Chords and shit, so I bought that and it was awesome.
But yeah, FD to that stupid chick who couldn't speak English because she's learning to speak English.
She lives in the freaking United States!
Speak English, dammit!
We don't speak Italian here!
English!
So... So yeah.
Aside from that, FD to my mom for making me listen to this stupid, like, spa music tape on the way down to Denial's.
Okay, this guy, he took a cover... I mean, he was covering, like, Fur Elise in, um... He called it Imagine, but I don't think he said it.
Yeah, it was so important.
It was so masculine.
I have some really weak FUs this week.
FU for me not being a good FU.
Yeah, fuck you.
Play my music.
Oh, and F you to my fucking co-worker of mine, Linda.
Freaking keeps telling me to get back to work and stop browsing the internet when I have the highest phone time out of the company.
I took like 400 calls in one day and shit, which is pretty huge.
And she just has the nerve to start bitching at me about being on the phone.
Then she goes back and starts talking with the other girl who's not on the phone.
Talking about, like, her boyfriend or some guy that she thought was cute and had a nice ass and all that shit.
So, yeah, after her and that's it.
I'm done.
That was fucked up.
Next.
I have a couple FUs this week, believe it or not.
No!
Um, my first F you goes to, um, anybody I've ever gone out clubbing with before, because I've always had to drive in the past.
But this week, I got to be a participant in the drinking festivities when I went out to the bar.
I got so drunk off my ass, I had to be carried out of the bar, and I had so much fun, that I've just been missing out all these years.
So, um, F people who always make me be the designated driver.
Um, a big F you to Politary, I hate you.
Um, yes.
Everybody knows your collar is covered.
They're probably trying to do you a favor.
F you, lady.
No.
Step on your foot.
Ow.
Watch out or I'll kick your face in.
Like, what's your face in there?
A big F you to my 2DX controller.
You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
I second that.
A big F you to the song DXY.
You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
No, it's tack!
And a big F you to Colors for the same reason.
You're a piece of shit and I hate you.
F you to whoever called me during the show.
That was embarrassing.
F you to anyone that doesn't live in Sacramento because you live in a better place, I'm sure.
No, except for Davis.
Davis sucks.
And Chico sucks too.
That's Republican Davis.
Gwen lives in Naples, Florida.
You're right, I'm sorry.
And Florida is also exempt from that because you have twins.
They also messed up the... They still messed up the fucking ballot counts down there in Florida for like the governor race.
Dude, that's a dump of fucking chads!
What's a chad?
What's a poop in a freaking home for?
I swear to God, they're so stupid.
Yeah, they're stupid.
Stupid old people that live in Florida.
Old people suck.
That'd be the old people.
Why don't you die?
No one wants you around.
That's why they're sending you to Florida.
Just go die.
Die.
No one misses you.
Die.
They'll make room for more resorts.
Florida is like the gateway to hell.
It's like where they keep all the old people and wait to die.
Actually, hell is really close to there.
It's a small little island.
But yeah, it's crazy hot and humid every day.
Oh, and F you to Spazzy, who's in the chat room right now, because he got to go see Hot People last night, and I didn't, and I'm jealous.
So F you.
Okay.
Is it my turn now?
Yes, it's your turn, Dave.
No, I get it.
My song.
My song's gay.
Literally.
Okay.
I don't really have that many F yous, but many of them are like Rob's.
Okay, first, F you to my parents for not wanting to take me out here.
I have to, uh, I actually have to stop that for a minute because I have to thank Dave's parents for the taquitos.
Oh, okay.
That's all.
Tacos!
The taquitos.
Okay.
That was horrible.
Die.
The taquitos.
Yes.
Okay.
Anyway.
Fuck them for not wanting to take me out here and for making me read 100 pages of a shitty-ass book today so I could cum.
Because a yellow raft in blue water is crap.
I hate reading.
And then, also I fuck you's to many 2DX songs which I can't pass, such as StarMind for the fucking last ten, like, two seconds of it.
Because it has, like, 20 notes at once, and I always get down to 58% or whatever it is when you miss all of them.
So fuck that.
And fuck all the seven stars that I can't pass.
Okay.
I think that's it.
That's it.
It's Raining Men.
Fuck this song.
Oh wait, no.
And fuck Twen because he said that he wanted to be fucked.
No, he said that he wanted to be... Whatever makes you happy.
He said that he wanted to be everyone's fuck you.
So.
And now we're... And now we're gonna go to Black Labs FUs.
And this song is meant to be ironic.
It's the cat song.
Yay.
Okay, first, fuck this song.
Because it's about cats.
I would have rather heard Who Let the Dogs Out than this.
I can erase that, don't tempt me.
Okay, like it.
No.
Okay, let's see.
First of all...
I didn't get to do my FUs of last week, so fuck that.
Because I was not around.
I was at home most of the weekend.
Oh, you had a birthday or something that you think is more important.
Oh, shut up, Rob.
Yeah, well, it happened to be my 18th birthday, which was actually this past Wednesday, but I went home the weekend before, which made me mishap.
And I went paintballing, which was cool, but we got rained out.
I found out that he found my live journal and read through every single entry.
And that kind of pissed me off, really.
It's on the internet.
It's not private.
No, but the fact is that... But there's more to it.
Yeah, see, it's kind of a longer story here, but what he did was he actually first...
saw it on my computer and then went and snooped through it then he gave it the addresses to the rest of the people in the suite that I live in and they all read it and now they're they get all they're like all freaked out now and then they're they actually one of them actually told me that they thought they kind of had the consensus that I was going to go snap and fucking kill them because of all the ranting I do in my live journal so say yes ha ha
The fact that they actually went through and started using it against me really irked me.
And then my roommate actually went and decided to instant message a couple of my friends from my friends list asking about the stuff in there.
And it was like, okay, that's just getting a bit too fucking nosy.
And that really pissed me off.
I think that's the first time anyone's ever said irk on this show.
I beg to differ.
I believe I would have said that word in the past.
Come on.
I like that word.
Ert.
Like Erkel.
I think Irina said it before.
I will have to check the archives.
Anyway, Black Lapis is continuing.
Yes.
I'm going to continue.
Let's see.
Fuck the dining halls at Davis because they serve the same food over and over again and I'm sick of it already.
And next time I eat there, I swear I'm going to puke all over the table there.
What?
No, let him finish.
Let me finish, damn it!
I'm just... I'm just... You didn't let him move.
No.
Let Twen move.
Okay.
Let's see.
Fuck the rain for messing up this wheel on my bike so that now my brakes don't work.
I have to get those fixed now.
And, uh, let's see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, uh, yeah, this one's kinda recent here.
Fuck Rob for getting me addicted to 2DX.
You're welcome.
I spent, like, when I came over here last night and, like, let's see, we got here sometime, like, what was it, like, 8 o'clock or something?
Yeah, about then.
And then, I started playing 2DX, and I was like, okay, this is cool, and the next thing I know, I'm still playing, and it's 9 o'clock in the morning!
I played for probably 10 or 11 straight hours before I decided, oh shit, I think I need to get some sleep.
So I slept for two hours, and then went and played some more.
And I still want to go back and play more now.
And now I have to go home and have 2DX and I'm going to cry.
I'm done.
Alright, this song needs to be in DDR extreme.
Maybe it will be.
Any other FUs in the room before I get... Alright, Dave has another one.
Alright, Dave, yes.
Wait.
Oh shit.
I had it!
Fuck.
Wait.
Loki, Loki has it.
Okay, real quick, FU2, Old Navy, that place is Satan, it's just, it's evil, I hate the commercials, I hate the old stars that get on there for the stupid commercials, I wish they'd all go to hell, and then the whole place, when you walk in there, it's just like one big giant Old Navy commercial, it's like...
It's like so annoying!
I hate them!
And the only reason I went through to buy clothes was because I had a fucking gift certificate for $50.
So I thought I spent all the money on the gift certificate, because I was trying to get out of there as quick as possible.
Then I got there.
Oh, you have $6 left in your card!
DAMMIT!
NOOOOOO!
And I had to go back there and shop more.
No matter what, they're just gonna keep me there!
No!
Anyways, that's it.
Alright, it's chat room time.
Let's go to the chat room FUs.
Here we go.
I'm going to run through these as fast as I can.
This is the longest FUs I've ever, but that's alright.
JB says, um, F you to Winamp because it skips too much.
And DSCS says, um, F me, Sky, for making him work, fuck being sick for almost two weeks, fuck the doctors for scaring him about possibly having tuberculosis, and fuck homework.
Typical T-Gangs right there.
Why don't you go to the doctors?
What you don't know won't kill you.
I... No.
Twenz says, uh, fuck you to lesbians, fuck you to chicks without dicks, fuck you to chicks without tits.
Hey, hey, hey, okay, no titted chicks need lovin' too, okay?
He said, F you to chicks without dicks.
Anywho, uh, fuck you to Loki for not giving him the patron number to that hooker.
I don't have the pager number, so how can I give it to you?
Fuck you to still having his fucking cold, and fuck you to Macintoshes.
And, Twin, stop saying that, because I'll, like, hack your ass with my Mac, okay?
Mac's rule, bitch!
Let me talk about the Mac.
Let me see.
My toaster has more processing power than a fucking Mac.
Anyway, moving on.
More chatroom FUs.
EOSFBB.
That must be an acronym for something I don't know.
YASVB.
I'm just going to call him YASVB.
YASVB says, many fuck yous go out to Cox Cable.
Providers for Vegas.
Cox Cable.
Who took away his tech TV last year.
Fuck you to Gail Berman, Fox executive, who cancelled his show Dark Angel.
Fuck you to the DMV just for being hell with the whole Baskin Robbins system going on.
Now serving number 21.
Number 21.
Fuck you to Dave for not beating the Ancient Boy game and fuck you to VidPower for not letting me plug his restaurant.
Dude, that game is a bitch.
I played for maybe half an hour straight and I could get down to one little fucking egg with two cracks in it and I couldn't beat it and it just bounced around and I hit it like 30 times back and forth and it never hit it.
It was such shit.
And then I was about to hit it and then a pop-up window came and I lost.
It's like, fuck!
By the way, I'm being told it's Yoastbub.
Yoastbub?
Yoastbub.
Yeah, Yoastbub, it wasn't my fault.
Go Yoastbub yourself.
Anyway.
Andrew says, what are the FUs for?
I have a private message, what are the FUs for?
Hopefully you're getting the hit by this point.
DCB says, no FU, he just wants to plug his tournament Fremont 2, January 11th, 2003 at Funtime Pizza He wants special FU music, but I didn't give it to him because I'm lazy Skyline DC505 says, FU to HISP for not letting me get sleep and sucking at Shaft and getting me sick this weekend, thanks
Dark Tetsuya says, fuck you to mom's work, that's why I miss chef.
Vid Pawa says, I don't have an FU of the week, but rather a thank you of the week.
Oh, he has a thank you of the week, how nice.
My thank you of the week goes to Cube Club, which is a public event sponsored by Nintendo and Panasonic.
Basically, I played GameCube games and got free shit.
Plus, I got a Nintendo wristband for beating total strangers at Mario Party 4, so thank you to the Cube Club.
Aww, wasn't that special.
I'm going to that Cube Club thing in, like, two weeks.
I got tickets.
Where's the Cube Club at?
I wanna go to the Cube Club.
They're doing it in San Francisco.
Are they doing it in Sacramento, I wonder?
I don't know if they're doing it in Sacramento.
I wanna go to the Cube Club!
They're doing it in San Francisco on Thanksgiving weekend.
I'm going!
Yeah!
I'm gonna whoop some ass at Mario Party.
Get myself some free shit.
See, what I'd do if I went to that thing is if someone started beating me at Mario Party and just started kicking the ass of the person next to me, I'd be like, you don't wanna do that.
Fucker!
Vandalist says fuck you to Pac Bell for not installing DSL in his area.
Dial-up sucks.
Prowny face.
Jomama says fuck you to Toys R Us for being out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
For Vandalist, try winfirst.com.
By the way, Yu-Gi-Oh, can you play my music real quick?
Fuck Yu-Gi-Oh because, okay, get this.
I, now this is just picky for me because being a Japanese major, I go into the Kadan store to hang out sometimes because my dad manages a game shop in Rancho Cordova.
People go, do you have any of those Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
Oh, you only have the Chinese ones.
Fuck you, they're Japanese.
Can't you see?
There's a difference.
They look different.
Stupid people.
Anyway, but no.
This whole Yu-Gi-Oh!
craze is retarded.
Okay, get this.
I have a comic book.
This is how comics come in Japan when they're new.
They come in a bound volume of different comics in one volume.
Well, I have a Yu-Gi-Oh!
one from 1991, okay?
It's old.
Get over it!
It's a show about playing a card game!
It's fucking old!
Yay!
Then again, there's also Hikaru no Go, which is about playing Go.
The cards come to life!
No, but I think that the anime is like Pokemon except with cards.
Yeah, and more strategy.
Which means it's just as lame as Pokemon.
Yeah, but like the cards cost like $4 a booster pack.
That's some ridiculous amount of money.
So remember this.
Digimon owes you.
Watch it in Japanese.
Digimon, I've never seen the Japanese.
I have two DVDs.
I will show you.
Okay, cool.
Oh, I remembered my F.U.
now.
F.U.
to my back for looking all ugly, and F.U.
me for being tall, because now I have nasty-ass stretch marks on my back.
They're the most disgusting stretch marks of all time.
Really?
No, they're so disgusting.
I'll show you later.
Right.
I have a few more chat rooms.
Two more chat room F.U.s, and then we're done.
EOSFVB!
Did you do it already?
Says it's name change time.
I did do him already, but I'm giving the correct pronunciation.
It's E-O-S-F-B-E-B.
Whatever.
And Andrew did submit an F-U after all.
He says F-U-Rob.
Thank you.
Fuck you too, bitch.
That's it.
Oh, I have to check the mailbag.
Mailbox!
I predict emptiness.
Yeah, I predict emptiness too, but we're gonna check the mailbox.
If they don't know where to send emails by now, they're out of luck.
Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com We have one unread message.
Let's see.
I like radio.
I like oranges.
I like lounges.
I like Orange Lounge Radio.
Wow, what a concept.
Beautiful.
I like anything that's on a happy note.
No alias, just a Ryan G. We like you, Ryan G.
You're cool.
He's a real G. What up, G?
Alright, we're going to take another break.
Coming from the room full of the most cracker-ass people.
F you to crack us.
On that note, we're going to take a quick break and we will come back.
And at that point, we're going to do a little segment we call List List.
And it's a five-person list list tonight, so it should be exciting.
The topic is very interesting.
That's all I have to say.
So, here we go.
We're taking another quick break.
We'll be back in a little bit.
See ya.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
I can't wait until I find the real tomorrow.
SAKEDOWN Music that sounds like an explosion.
A rising tension.
It doesn't go far.
It's an engine development.
I'll jump on this wind.
All the light and sadness.
I'll throw them all away.
I'm not the kind of person who likes boring sad things.
Thank you for watching!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge being on a music and more show?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
Hi.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We're back.
No one would dance with that guy even if he did ask.
The only decent DDR film ever made, by the way.
That was fucking hilarious.
Oh, I'm sorry, Loki disagrees.
That was stupid.
He disagrees it was decent.
Let's do our list list.
Some people have a very big experience in their wrist action, so that should help for them.
But... You know, hey, I know people that freestyle playing 2DX, namely me.
It's fun.
So, um, I think that, uh... So let's explain, because this is the season premiere and we have some new people listening.
Let's explain what listless is.
And it's not list list, it's list less.
So, um, listless is the segment... Now they get it.
I just talk funny, I'm sorry.
Listless... Quirky!
Um...
This segment of the show, we make the definitive list on some topic.
And basically the way it works is that we're all going to name our top three.
So we'll have a list of 15 beverages that are great to play, or that are great to drink while playing DDR, 2DX, whatever.
And then we'll all go around the room and everybody eliminates one thing from the list.
And then the chat room will vote to decide the ultimate DDR beverage, Bimani beverage.
So...
That's how it works.
And if you ever saw the old VH1 show, The List, nothing to do with it.
Absolutely nothing to do with that.
Nothing at all.
Okay, so... Wait, wait.
That show is the stupidest fucking show ever.
Because, okay, they let the audience pick their favorite that gets put on the list, but the audience already picked their favorite.
So, why wouldn't they just pick it again?
The reason why that show sucked is that Lauryn Hill somehow ended up on every single list they ever did.
It could be Best Male Artist of the 80s, and Lauryn Hill was number one.
Every time.
Every time.
She did one good album.
One good album.
I mean, unless you count the Fugees, but you don't, because that wasn't a solo thing.
But anyway, that's a whole other rant.
Let's go for our list list.
I'll do an F you to Lauryn Hill fans next week.
So, because I'm special, I'll start.
My number three is Oxygenated Water.
Oxygenated Water.
I don't remember the brand, but I bought Oxygenated Water one time, and I felt like absolutely freaking refreshed after it.
It was really cool.
Did you just do the same thing as by shaking up a bottle of water?
I mean, that's what's Oxygenated.
This is like super Oxygenated Water.
I don't know.
But it was kind of cool, and I felt a little lightheaded.
So, um, yeah.
Next.
Loki, your number three choice for best beverage for Bologna.
I suddenly really drink one thing.
The rest are just going to be what I would be drinking if I wasn't drinking one thing.
I'm going to have to say a 40-ounce malt liquor.
That's the winner.
No need to add anything.
All right, 40-ounce malt liquor.
A cult 45.
We're going to have Billy Dee Williams come out and play DDR.
Okay, now... Dave, you're number three, Vic.
Yeah.
Um, I don't really drink too many varieties of drinks, or soft drinks, or power drinks, or, you know, sports drinks, or whatever.
But, I know that one drink that gets me hyper as fuck, so I can play Keto and get all the way to Max X, is Jolt, because that gets me so, like... Jolt!
All the sugar and twice the caffeine.
That's what got me through college, by the way.
Yes.
Jolt.
Okay, Black Lab, your number three choice for best Pomani beverage.
All righty here.
As you may not know, the only DDR machine in Davis is in the Tapioca Express.
Excuse me.
So, appropriately enough, the drink that I usually get every time I go in there would be a strawberry snow bubble from the Tapioca Express.
It's kind of like a Slurpee.
So you're specifically stating a strawberry snow bubble?
Yes, I am.
Okay.
Okay.
Just wanted to double check.
Well, well, yeah.
I know, it'll get wiped out pretty easy.
I just need something to fill space, but... Yeah, it was... It's like, kind of like a Slurpee, except it's like, they use like a special syrup in it, and it's kind of like they use milk in it too, so it's like milky, and it's like really, really, really, really good.
And plus it's really good when you have tapioca in it too.
Yeah.
Alright, Strawberry Snowbubble from Black Lab.
My number three pick for best Vimani beverage, and if you've ever been to one of my infamous house parties, you'll know why I'm naming this one.
My number three pick is Goldschlager.
Yes.
Instant Fun, Just Add Goldschlager is my number three pick.
That's all I have to say.
For all the kiddies, it basically tastes like drinking cough syrup, but it fucks you right up.
It just fucks you right up.
Here I am trying to be healthy.
Okay, my number two pick is Berry Propel.
Berry Propel.
And the thing is, I usually have this with me more often than my number one choice because my number one choice is harder to find.
However...
There's a bottle of Berry Propel freaking sitting in Rob's refrigerator because I bought it, but I had to have my vanilla Coke first.
All right, so Berry Propel is Jamie's number two drink.
Loki, your number two pick for best banani beverage.
Well, as I stated before, I don't really have anything other than my number one pick, so I'm going to have to go with imported Mexican tap water.
I'm sorry, imported Mexican what?
Tequila?
I'm sorry, tap water?
Ew!
Yuck!
It's not with the cayenne pepper to go with it, it'd be for pooping.
Imported Mexican tap water.
By the way, little known fact for people who don't have the, you know, years of natural healing experience that I do, if you're going to go to Mexico and drink the water...
Better eat cayenne pepper before you do, because it will keep you from shitting all over everything.
Okay.
Oh, Jesus.
Alright.
Um, where are we?
Dave, yes, your number two choice.
Well, I'm not sure I can beat imported Mexican tap water.
But, um, my number two choice is, uh, Vanilla Coke Icy.
Because those things are hella good.
And they're really, really sweet.
Like, twice as sweet as a normal Vanilla Coke.
Vanilla Coke Icy.
Good choice.
Good choice.
Quackwab, you're number two pick, please.
This one of mine is just like a recently discovered thing, I just tried it out once, it was like, oh, this is hella good!
It's, uh, it's made by Snapple, it's the Atomic Elements drink, which is Jack Apple flavor.
It's got caffeine and ginseng and a bunch of other good shit that keeps me awake and hella hyper, and that's one of the things that I had last night to help contribute to my 2D expansion.
Very nice.
My number two pick?
My number two pick was Red Bull and Malibu.
However, at the risk of sounding like a lush, I'm just going to cut that to Red Bull.
Oh, the drink that looks like urine.
Yes, the drink that smells like pussy.
Or so I've heard.
It actually does look like urine.
Yeah, it does look like pee.
But you know, my favorite bar has it now where it comes out of the spray.
Like, they don't even have to open up the cans anymore.
It's just right in the tap.
It's like Pepsi, Sprite, Red Bull.
Fucking rules.
Alright, so now we're down to our number one picks.
Jamie, your number one best Behmany beverage.
Well, I have often said that one of these days I'm actually going to own one of the vending machines for this beverage.
I have ordered this stuff plenty of times and brought it in to our Viggo to play and drink and stuff.
Pocari Sweat, the drink that actually does look like sweat.
And it tastes much better than Gatorade.
Pocari Sweat.
Yes.
Alright.
It's sweatalicious.
Pokari Sweat is kind of an intimidating name to me, I don't know.
I don't know how I feel about Pokari Sweat, but anyway.
Let's move right along, shall we?
Loki, your number one pick for best bemani beverage.
Uh, I'm just gonna go with Surge, because I love that stuff, it's good.
Surge!
Surge sounds like it should be with Slim Jim, I don't know, but anyway.
Alright, so Surge, which they don't even make anymore, correct?
Did they still make it?
Did they?
I don't know where to get it.
No.
Dave, your number one pick for best Baymadi beverage.
I can't believe I was like, after I said Vanilla Coca-Icy, I completely forgot what I was going to say for this one, but I finally remembered.
Hawaiian Punch.
Because they sell that down at the shell for like 99 cents for a two liter.
And I remember the days when it's raining and everyone runs over there and buys like ten of them.
And then you all just take them back and put them in between the two DVR machines.
Would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?
Punch.
Don't punch!
Blackwab, your number one choice, please, for Best Pay Money Beverage.
As the people in the room can see, I have a hat on.
It has the logo splattered all over it.
And for those of you that aren't in the room and can't see it, it happens to be Mountain Dew Code Red.
It is fucking addicting to me.
I get it.
I always get leaders of it.
All the time.
I probably go through maybe... Well, let's see.
Actually, no.
I have two cases of cans in my dorm room right now.
One of which is in the fridge.
And I have Mountain Dew Code Red stuff on my walls.
That shit tastes worse than Cherry Nightville.
It does not.
No!
Touch code red and die!
Alright, my number one pick.
Now...
Those of you know, I know we have a lot of people from Vegas in the chat room, so I know you guys will agree with me on this one, because this is the best Bimani drink I've ever had.
I had the most fun playing Bimani.
Who's in Vegas?
We have a few people from Vegas in the chat room.
Isn't, like, Eos?
Yes, I believe they're from Vegas.
And Maple also, right?
No, Maple's in the Vegas.
Oh, really?
Okay, never mind.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I believe VidPower's from Vegas.
We have some other folks there.
Anyway, can I finish?
Can I finish?
No.
So those of you in Vegas know about the Hilton.
And the Hilton's got this little place called the Star Trek Experience.
And at that experience, they sell a drink.
Oh, you bitch.
The Warp Core Breach, ladies and gentlemen.
I fucking love the Warp Core Breach.
I have done Drunken DDR on the Warp Core Breach and it is the shit.
Warp Core Breach.
Seven different kinds of Bacardi, Asobi, and Razzmatazz all mixed together in a fishbowl served with dry ice and they won't serve it to just one person.
Well, you can't order a one-person serving.
Oh yeah, they have it different now.
You can't order a one-person serving.
The DDR Freak Moderator's Trip.
I have a friend that lives in Vegas.
My friend Ciara.
There was me and Iguana Girl and her boyfriend Islander and my friend Tiara and her man.
We all go to the Warp Corp.
We all go to the Star Trek experience and proceed to go on the ride once.
Then have a warp core breach.
Go on the ride again.
That's exactly what I did at the 25th RockyCon, which was the first time I ever saw DDR, by the way.
Well, my friends left, and it was just me and Iguana Girl and Islander, and we all decided that we were going to go over to Circus Circus and play DDR in there.
That's exactly what I ended up doing, and I ended up... I believe I threw up the Romulan chicken strips later that night.
It was a tribute to that first time on DDR.
Uh...
And it was, half the tab was broken.
And it was just like the... Drunken DDR is cool.
Drunken DDR rules.
Especially on a Warp Corp, because we were like plenty drunk after we played DDR.
Anyway.
So now here we do it.
We have a list.
This is a... I was not expecting the list to look this diverse, that's for sure.
A few notable exceptions.
According to our chatroom, we have made a few notable exceptions, including...
Water.
I said oxygenated water.
Pepsi Blue is the big thing right now.
That stuff is shit.
It tastes like someone ate strawberries and puked them.
I was thinking about that, but Vanilla Coke Icy's like so own that, because they do.
That Pepsi Blue shit is nasty.
I heard it makes you shit green, but I haven't really tested that.
Anyway, nope, nope, alright.
And then, uh, also, uh, Pussy Juice was another suggestion.
I was actually thinking of saying that, but then I was like, no.
Red Fusion, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.
You know what, let's just go ahead and vote.
You know, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.
So they didn't make the list, so F you.
Here's our list.
Oxygenated water, 40 ounce malt liquor, Jolt,
Strawberry Snowbubble, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Imported Mexican Tap Water, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Red Bull, Picari Sweat, Surge, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
So, we're going to start eliminating shit from this list right now.
Jamie, what the fuck's coming off this list?
The imported Mexican tap water.
I would prefer not to play DDR until they have explosive diarrhea.
Diarrhea, diarrhea revolution.
So, imported Mexican tap water's coming off the list.
And we have a cry.
Loki, what's coming off the list?
I'm going to have to say goodbye to Red Bull because, yeah, it does look like pee.
It smells like pee and probably is pee, but that's all right.
All right, so Red Bull's gone.
Fine.
But you know what?
You gotta mix it with Malibu, but I didn't want to sound like a lush, because I don't know if you realize, but all my other drinks are alcoholic.
So anyway.
Okay.
Dave, what's coming off the list?
Having not had most of these, such as the Warp Core Breach or something like that, or, you know, Goldschlager... You're just gonna have to trust us.
I think... Yeah, I know.
I think I'll take off the Strawberry Snowbubble, because... What...
I mean, it would seem like it would be too heavy to play DDR afterwards if it was all milky.
I know, but it just doesn't seem like the type of DDR drink.
Oh, I think they'll go have a strawberry snow bubble and go play Waka Laka.
I wouldn't have been able to do that in the first place because it's only a max one.
Strawberry snow bubbles off the list.
All right.
Black Lab, what's coming off this list of what's left here?
Yeah, let's see.
As original as some of these are, I'd say the 40 ounce has to go.
That's just a bit too much liquid to drink.
40 ounce malt liquors coming off the list.
You just made Billy Dee cry.
I would like to watch him cry.
When I come home from a hard day of playing DDR, I like to relax with a nice ice cold Colt 45.
Oh, another notable exception we left off the list.
Balls.
Balls!
Let's give Balls the honorable mention.
Nope.
Balls got forgotten.
Obviously none of us are drinking Balls.
And I'd say maybe if we thought of it before we started eliminating drinks, then yes.
But no, too late now.
Too late now.
It gets an honorable mention.
How's that?
Balls gets an honorable mention.
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
Yes, you have to repeat it.
Black Lab said... Okay, I said, I had never had balls.
Referring to the drink.
Blue balls on top of that.
Anyway, can I finish?
Do I get to take my drink off now?
Whatever.
My drink, this is an easy pick for me.
I think this stuff tastes like turpentine, cat pee, I hate it.
Bye bye, Surge.
I hate Surge.
I fucking love search.
Dude, this is the first time that none of mine have been eliminated ever.
I've been keeping track.
Poor Matt is denied.
The first time ever.
You are denied.
For those keeping score at home, all of Loki's picks got eliminated.
And how does that make you feel?
That's right.
I'll live.
God, Surge tastes like shit.
Okay, important message.
Okay, if you don't like Surge, you can drink that Pesty Blue shit.
Yes.
For the record, yes.
For Lamb's Blood, but, you know, I didn't add that on there.
Lamb's Blood?
You're a sick bastard.
How about, like, cow brain mucus?
All right.
Yuck, you guys are weird.
You guys are so weird.
I'm sure it was the time that we were at Brookfields and Sheepham ordered, what was it, a monkey's brain or something?
I don't remember.
I don't think I was there.
That was great.
No, but he ordered it.
I'm loading up a song here to play during the break here.
Hi, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to have Jamie read the list and then I'll paste it in the chat room and you guys will have five minutes to vote.
So, Jamie, would you please let me post it in the chat room.
You've got to send me your vote over a private message in the chat room.
Jamie, would you be so kind as to read this list off?
There, unhighlighted.
Oxygenated water.
Goldslugger.
Berry Propel, Vanilla Cook IC, Snapple Atomic Elements, Bokari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
All right, so there it is.
Send me your votes over private message in the chat room.
If they don't come over private message, they don't count.
In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break.
I'm just trying to cue up some music for you guys.
No, just to...
Just to reiterate for you guys, no, what you vote for will not be taken off the list.
We've already done that.
That was all done in-house.
We're the celebrities, so we get to do that.
You guys are picking the winners.
You guys are picking the top three.
So out of that list, you're just going to send me your favorite.
and whatever gets the most votes wins.
First place and whatever gets second most votes gets second place.
So you're voting for your very favorite out of that list.
In the meantime, here's a song that is often requested on the station ever since we played it on one of Jamie's... No, not Dirty.
Dirty is requested, but it's not that.
It's something that Jamie put on one of her pre-shows and everybody's loved it since then, so we're going to play it during the actual show.
Here you go.
You got five minutes to vote.
We'll be right back.
Let's play some Tetris, motherfucker.
And you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
And you feel it, feel it And you feel it, feel it
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Hi, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just finished up, or we're finishing up, we're bringing an end to our listless segment, where we are determining the best Behmany drink.
And this was the final list, what Dave?
I just beat Spin the Disc on 2DX and 7.
Wow.
Yay, that's my fifth seven star.
All the girls want to have sex with you now.
Oh, yeah.
How many girls are even listening?
I don't know how many girls are listening.
I don't get that kind of breakdown.
Twin.
Anyway.
We're kidding.
Oh.
Newt.
Newt.
Newt.
Anyway.
This is the list.
Oxygenated Water, Jolt, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Pocari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.
And now... Wait, hold on, hold on.
What?
I just have to say, if, like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date him.
Anyway!
She's in a lesbian drive.
Anyway!
What does that have to do with the money?
That is not cool.
Not cool.
Spreading personal information out on the radio.
Nope.
Oh yeah, after you're talking about your whole hooker experience.
Hey, that is me sharing, okay?
That's not me sharing about someone else.
I apologize if the hooker was listening to the radio show.
I didn't mean anything about it.
Call me.
Can we read the list now, or should we just throw the list away?
No, but I haven't read the top three, the climax of this whole segment.
Oh.
Surely you guys wouldn't let me get through a segment without climaxing.
No guy would.
Surely Temple.
Okay, go.
Alright.
The number three best Bomani drink is Hawaiian Punch.
Yay, Hawaiian Punch.
Hey, want a Hawaiian Punch?
Bam!
Alright.
The number two best Bomani drink is a Vanilla Coke Icy.
Yay!
Damn all you trendy whores.
No, I'm just kidding.
Vanilla Coke Iced, these are good.
And the number one best Behmany drink of all time is... Pocari Sweat.
Jamie is a winner.
This is the second one I've gotten the first place on.
Alright, so there you go.
That is the list.
That was cool.
That's it, I know, we still got a half hour of show left.
We don't end at 9 anymore, we end at 9.30.
Yes, Loki!
What?
We've got plenty to fill a half an hour.
And this is Bomani?
No, it's Bomani stuff, not another hooker story.
I only have one hooker story and I just used it.
Sim update.
We've got plenty of stuff to talk about.
Okay, first thing, Tourney Mix 3 has been finally announced officially, so it's on.
Judging will begin sometime, I don't know, I don't have the dates in front of me.
I know it ends on the 31st, that's when the results will be posted, but
A lot of... I guess December 15th is when they start doing it.
Can't hear you unless you're talking to the mic.
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Anyways, so... Yeah, it's on, so just, you know, go check out the rules because there's plenty of them.
You need to... They're really being strict about what they're doing this time, so do check that out.
Also, there's another tournament going on.
I'm not even sure what it is.
It's like...
I don't know, it's some other sim tournament that I really wasn't paying attention to.
Yeah, it's out there too, so I'm sure someone will... Oh yes, and MakeEditGetPorn, that is still going on, so don't forget about that one.
One thing I forgot to ask about the MakeEditGetPorn contest is everybody who enters get porn, or just the winners?
Just the winners.
Just making sure.
I was going to say, that's a lot of porn for you to be sending out.
I could do it, but... So just the winners.
Just the top three.
Just the winners will get porn.
Third place gets a little porn.
Second place gets... Nope.
Just first place.
Oh.
The first place person is going to get all the porn?
Yeah.
That's a lot of porn.
We'll see.
We'll see how much porn I can acquire from...
And we're going to have an honorary... You have to specify if you want girl porn or boy porn, because there is going to be a boy porn prize.
Okay, well, not by me, but... We'll find something.
Orange Lounge will donate a boy porn prize.
Okay.
But anyways, yeah, Max Beats is the other one.
That's the other contest going on there, and there's like five categories entered there.
No prizes for that, but yeah, it's fine.
So go check that one out, too.
And, see, other than that, there's been some updates...
DWI finally decided to update their stuff.
So now they're trying to play catch up.
They're, I guess, playing catch up.
Anyways, they added the extra stage support for that, which Step Mania's had for a while now.
And they're also fixing a few other bugs.
They're still a good mile behind Step Mania.
No updates on Step Mania, but it's pretty good so far, so just check it out.
Other than that, DDRUK, they are putting together a lot of synced sets, full sets of files to download.
They have full sets of Disney's Rave.
Well, I have to say that's not completely full.
They're missing some of the double steps, but I mean, for the most part.
That's just if you're being anal retentive.
Yes, for the most part, it's complete.
They also have full sets of Euromix 1 and 2, all synced.
And they have Club Mix, the club of pens on there.
You're starting a fight here in the chatroom, StepMania versus DWI.
Oh, I don't care.
Let them fight!
Let them kill each other!
Anyway, so, yeah, those, go check that out, and I know for a fact, because I kind of help, that there will be a MOHA stuff.
Yes, Jamie has a question Have they ever done any of the Tokimeki songs?
Yep, all of them
I still haven't figured out how to get to that point, because I have Tokimeki 2.
Yeah, I have all of them.
I'm sure they'll be releasing a pack for that, too.
Let's see.
I'm actually considering entering Tourney Mix 3, by the way.
I have to ask you if my song's been used before, though, but I'll ask you off-air.
The one I want to do.
Well, I've already... See, this is what I've been doing today, is deciding which song I want to do.
I've narrowed it down to a couple options.
I already know, but I have a feeling it's been done.
Okay, number one was Things of Manory, and that was by Tack.
You'll instantly get my vote.
It's a six minute long song, I just cut it down to just over two and a half minutes.
So I have that one.
I have an 80s track that's being remixed, which is so far in the lead in my picks.
It's Amanda, originally by Boston, and it's covered by Brooklyn Queens.
It's a Ford's Transmix.
It's a really catchy song, so maybe we can play that later.
Oh, I've heard of this album.
So it's pretty sweet.
This is like another 80s trance.
I'm going to need to copy this before you leave, okay?
Yeah, okay.
It's got Journey on it.
Cool.
Yeah.
But it's not really Journey.
It's like an update.
I bought an album just like this the other day.
That's so crazy.
What album did you get?
I got one.
It's called Time After Time.
Damn it!
That's the one I've been looking for.
I got that one.
I need to get a copy of that.
Okay.
Sweet.
Anyways, back on the subject.
Back on the subject here.
Also, you've got a random Beatmania track.
I was looking at Hyperboundary Gate or Alien World.
I think that's by Ping Pong.
It's from Beatmania the final, I think.
But I was deciding between one of those.
But it's probably going to be Amanda because it's just a catchy song.
I don't think I've recognized the original, but it's just a catchy song and it'll be fun.
So now you're going to get five people doing that because they all heard you were going to do it.
They're all going to copy you.
That's fine, whatever, I don't care.
But yeah, has that ever happened in those contests where two people end up doing the same song?
Yeah, there was one with Mr. Larpus, I think.
That was Tourney Mix 1, they did that.
Dope.
They both end up losing, huh?
because they cancel each other's votes out.
That's why I've got to make sure my song hasn't been done before.
Yeah, so I'm doing that one, and it'll be pretty cool.
I mean, I'm sure there'll be someone probably doing Sakura and someone probably doing Xenon, which those have been done.
I mean, Sakura has 4,000 of them out there, so no one's going to vote for that.
And I'm sure BimaniRuler will sneak one out.
There's only one song that he has that was being released in the last set of released ones that he didn't quite get out, and that was The Return.
My guess, if he was to enter and be lazy and not actually make a new file, it'd be here to release the return.
Which, I heard is a really good transtrack, but it's seven minutes long, so that's probably not going to happen.
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But yeah, also my site, of course I've got to plug it again, leechfromloki.tk I'm getting to a point where I'm going to try to upload every single Beatmania song I have made right now by other people.
I just got a few more the other day.
I got Happy Wedding from... Happy to, happy to, happy to...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There's a few other ones I got files for.
So I'm going to be trying to upload.
I've got to reformat my whole page just to organize them in style groups and that type of thing so I can actually start uploading them easier that way.
But that's a lot of work.
Probably come see that next week.
Maybe I'll try to upload something tonight.
That's it.
Oh, oh, and releases, as far as home releases, Dancing Stage Party Edition finally came out.
Only problem is it has a huge freaking bug in it, which won't make it play on PS1s or PlayStations.
So that kind of sucks.
It only plays on PS2s for some reason, even though it's a PS1 game.
Whoops.
I want a copy of that, because I want to dance to Kylie Minogue.
Can't get you out of my head.
Well, hey, you know what, I'm sure that... I'm sure you'll see people that are in the UK, like NMR and that kind of stuff, they'll probably rip them.
So you'll probably see those out there.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I guess this is really old news, but it's new to me, and I'm just behind the times.
What can I say?
There's actually a hack done on Mega Man that's all done with DDR music.
I've heard of that.
Didn't Aaron in Japan do that one?
Yeah, DDR Man.
I don't know if he did it, but he's got it on his site.
I've got the MIDI files on my computer.
I'll bring them next week.
I believe we, you know what, I think we did that one episode.
You weren't here.
We went through it.
We talked about Game Boy DDR music.
Yes.
I've got them to 2DX midis.
We could do those.
Ah, 2DX Middies, that would be a fun show.
Wow, so what else is going on in DDR Bomani world right now?
Shaft is over.
Shaft is over.
I know some big news that's coming up.
What?
Yes.
Okay, well, we've got Southern Hills Golf Land is closing.
That was one big news item that came out this week.
Shiggle, one of the big golf lands, of course, popular guy, Shiggle Boss over on some of the message boards.
And that place is closing.
Apparently what's happened is the city council has rezoned that area to be some residential housing.
So Shiggle's going to be closing down, and who knows where those games will be going.
Probably to the Camelot Golf Land nearby.
I was just going to mention that if anyone looked at their calendar this week, they would notice that the 20th falls on a Wednesday next week.
And so 20 November, obviously you're going to have a bunch of new stuff going on in the DDR community.
Big Bomani thing.
I happen to know there's one major website relaunching on 20 November.
Yes, the number one... You'll know the spot to go to.
Yes.
Yes, ddrspot.com is relaunching starting on the 20th, so check that out.
I know SoCalKicks' site just relaunched.
Actually, he had to cancel it.
That was the big news.
He had to cancel that.
And he has a new tagline, by the way.
I'll show this to you guys now.
Because remember last week we were talking about the SoCalKicks tagline.
And we love SoCalKicks because he did the Orange Lounge website, so we forever owe him sexual favors.
No, not just me.
But see, now he has new tagline.
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just later.
Instead of just now, it'll be just later.
That's funny.
That kind of sucks for him, but we'll hope that he can get his website back up soon.
I know, but MoneyStyle's going to be doing something, and same with 2DXStyle.com.
Oh, they're going to be doing some special shit.
and maybe Orange Lounge Radio will do a special 20 November fuck off and you know what someone else is probably doing or I should say a certain somebody with a certain journal will be probably talking about 20 November as well since that does come out that day too
What about the 19th of November?
Yeah.
And everybody's neglecting 19 November, which is by far a better song.
Dear Diaries, today is 19 November.
Today is when I fap it furiously, because tomorrow Politary is coming to my house.
And I'll put pictures of the internet in my journal.
Speaking of journals, Jamie, you want to talk about the Orange Lounge Live Journal community that we have going now?
Yes, I set this up last Sunday right after the show.
If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, that is our orange lounge community.
And if you wish to join, it's open access.
However, if you fuck it up, we'll kick your ass out.
And what kind of posts will we expect to be seeing in the orange lounge live journal community?
Random shit.
Just like this show.
Well, basically, you know, those of us who have something to contribute to the show or the BitMoney community, or even things that have been slightly related, like I posted deep thoughts in there because we did talk about it last week.
or just, you know, things about the show.
You know, we announced the time changes, different things.
You know, go ahead and join up.
And make sure, by the way, that you actually join the community instead of set it to watch.
That way, if you join the community, you can post to it.
Also, everybody who is a member of the community is also on the friends list page.
But again, don't fuck it up.
Yeah, you fuck it up, your ass is out.
Yeah, but please post, because I think there's about five or six posts right now.
There's five, but there's plenty on the friends list.
Oh, boy.
You don't want to flood it, though.
I mean, so, you know, join, you don't have to post every day, but when you have something orange loungy to say, post it.
I hate to disappoint everybody, but I don't update my live journal ever.
Well, now you have a reason to.
No, because the only time that I talk in the live journal is like, guess what, my sim has a thousand songs now.
Guess what, my sim has a thousand and five songs now.
So it's just like...
We have a question from the chat room.
How exactly do I join the community?
Well, all you have to do, go to the info page.
When you go to the Orange Tops community, there's an info page.
It should be user info.
And it'll say right at the top.
Oh, yeah, user info.
It'll say right at the top.
If you want to join this community, click here.
And you want to list it as a friend, one of your friends.
It'll have a picture of a person with a PlaySmart by their head.
If you just listed as a friend, you're only going to be watching it.
You haven't actually joined it.
Oh, yes.
If you go to the profile and hit the click here link to join the community, it'll give you the option to set it as part of your Francis automatically, so you don't have to click the separate button on the profile page.
Thank you.
And we have a link posted in the chat room.
And another question, why can't we make it on YouJournal?
because everything else is just a rip-off of LiveJournal.
Actually, LiveJournal is open source.
LiveJournal is open source, so everything else basically rips off it.
But if you really, really need a LiveJournal code, I've got a few extra.
I have a couple.
If I think you don't suck, I'll give you one.
Yeah, PM me on a forum you know I'm on, and maybe I'll give you a code.
We'll see.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Possibly.
Okay, well, other news.
Any more money news we've got?
Um, no, but I was going to say that if you ever catch me in the chatroom, you can almost guarantee that I'll be throwing up random porn links every now and then.
So be sure to check... I'm there!
I've never seen you in there.
Loki comes in at about midnight.
Like, seriously, it's very late night.
Look at this chatroom statistics page.
He is on there.
Just very late at night.
He's on there at the under 80 posts, I think.
Yes, one of the low posters.
He's like, fine, I'm going to post... I think I've seen the channel like twice, okay?
I've been in there.
I was in there last night.
He's in there more often than I am.
Well, I'm in there more often than all of y'all.
Remember that one time I did the whole, like, you know, I'm making a sim file while I'm chatting thing?
Remember?
A big thank you, by the way, to all our chatters in the chat room tonight.
We've had a record.
We were pushing 20 people there at one point in the chat room.
So thanks, you guys, for blowing shit up in our chat room.
I used to go in the chat room more often, and so I got scared.
If you look at the stats, a lot of people are starting to idle more throughout the day and just talk at random points throughout the day.
So just come join our chat room.
For recent accomplishments, I passed many double Onis, because RVGL's Max 2 machine was on free play.
So, yay.
Yeah, it was on free play, because every Saturday morning, they turn all the machines on free play, and they have to go around to each one by hand.
So, I guess they forgot.
It happens.
And so, I got to beat lots of ones like Tempo Changer and stuff.
It was cool.
Yay.
Okay, so we're going to take another really quick break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to wrap up the show with final thoughts, and maybe another quick topic.
Oh, yes, Loki, before we go to... Really quick last minute.
It's kind of an FU that I forgot earlier.
Oh, boy.
Don't worry.
Okay.
It's a big FU to RVTL's...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and then we will be back so we'll be back very soon
OHA!
OHA!
OHA!
The early bird gets the worm!
Yeah!
Woo!
Come on!
Get it!
Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!
Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!
Pump that body, pump that body, come on, come on, yeah!
Pump that body, pump that body, pump that body, put it, put it, put it, put it on!
It's time to scream it!
It's time to scream it!
It's time to scream it!
Music Music Music
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
You're going to edit that down a little bit.
Well, I actually have an edited down version.
I thought I burned it on the CD, but that's the CD I listen to in the car, so I guess not.
That's Amanda, which was originally done by the 80s group Boston, and this new version is done by Brooklyn Queens.
It's a Ford's Transmix and can be found on...
Vic Latino presents 80s Now.
It's a CD that was on sale at Tower, so go check it out.
It's pretty good, but I'd probably recommend Time After Time, which is the CD I was looking for.
I don't know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I bought it.
But it's okay.
I was on 80s with a kick after playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, so I just had to get some remixed 80s stuff.
What is up with this...
Grand Theft Auto Vice City, I never played those games, that game, so Dan's store was a fucking nightmare the day that game came out It was full of all stupid people But the CDs, oh my god, the CDs are awesome because they have You know, when you're playing GTA, you can change the station And you have the DJ come up and they say something funny Well, the DJs are on the CDs Introducing some of the tracks The Latina one is absolutely hilarious
And there's a new wave one too, which I like.
So we're coming into the final home stretch of the show.
I thought maybe we'd go around and talk about...
Our best Bomani moment of the week.
Of the week?
Yes, of the week.
Okay, Jamie hasn't picked up and played 2DX twice this week.
But what did you do?
I passed Fantasy on Light 7.
So there you go.
Okay, I'm always slow on the Bomani games, I will admit it.
But I had been trying to beat Fantasy on Light 7 forever.
It was one of two songs I had left to do on 4th style.
and I've been getting 76, 78, 76, 78.
I beat it with a 90% today, so I'm happy.
Woohoo!
And I'm getting there on Get On Beat.
Ooh, yeah!
And I almost beat Voltage today.
Very cool.
In 7 key, by the way, not in like 7.
Any Bamani moments of the week you would like to share with us?
I didn't really do anything other than download shit off the internet.
That was Bomani related.
I downloaded more sim files to add something like 1588 now or something like that.
But yeah, that's pretty much all I did.
Reorganized my sim stuff.
Updated some of my files with full sets instead of just the partial shit I had.
It's about it, I mean, you know, update my website, you know, fix some links and shit, uh, direct this guy who couldn't speak to, uh, find MP3s, so, like I said.
Cool!
Black Lab, yes.
Besides the obvious part of me now being a bitch of 2DX6 style, um... And 5th style, and 4th style.
Yes, that's true.
and ThirdStyle, which didn't have Celebrate.
I couldn't find Celebrate.
Maybe I just don't have it unlocked yet.
Anyway.
Anyways.
Let's see.
Other than that, I haven't done shit, Beemani-wise.
Haven't been to arcades, haven't been to Tapioca Express to play.
I really didn't play that much Beemani when I went home over the weekend.
And, yeah, I'm deprived.
Help me, please.
Oh, Jamie has another one she wants to share.
I full comboed Cowgirl.
Rad.
I'm happy, because gallops are one of my weakest things.
Did you go over for Boba and you beat it then?
No, this was right after Shaft.
I was damn tired, exhausted, and hardly got to eat anything.
So right before they were going to take the machine off of event mode, I was like, fuck all of you, I'm going to play, okay?
Damn it, I've been running back and forth just so that you people could have a good time, which I'm glad everyone did, and I was really happy.
I'm gonna play DDR, hell.
So I played Cowgirl, and I full combo'd it.
Ownage.
Well, I was dead tired, and then I went home and took Vicodin.
You took some drugs.
Yes, that's for 13 hours.
I actually don't know why I came up with this.
I don't have any Bimani news to report.
I barely played any at all.
I played a little 2DX.
I haven't passed shit new.
I'm still stuck at the same point I was.
I...
I keep fucking up the last few measures of V, otherwise I could pass the goddamn song on 7-key.
I haven't really passed anything else.
I'm getting closer to DXY.
That's about it, personally.
So, I guess that's about it.
We've got only a few minutes left in the show.
Let's go around and get everybody's final... Where's Dave?
Get Dave in here.
We've got to get his final thought.
What did he pass?
He says he passed Presto, yay.
Hey, that's impressive.
Okay, so let's talk about everybody's final thought for today.
Jamie, your final thought.
I'll go final.
What?
I'll go final.
You'll go final.
Loki, your final thought.
Definitely be watching the Fry's ads because they've been having a lot of good stuff really cheap lately.
I mean, you can't beat... If I didn't want to stick with the name brand Yamaha, I could have gone with the verbatim CD-R burner for $19, a 40-speed CD burner.
Let's just put it this way.
40-speed... I put my shoes on today while I was burning a CD.
The CD burner finished burning my CD before my shoes were on.
I mean, that's just crazy shit right there.
So, definitely check that stuff out.
Watch my site later this week.
There should be some updates, I hope, if I get around to it.
I've been kind of busy.
And, yeah, that kind of shit.
So, watch that.
Look for TourneyMix because you're going to have a lot of cool files to download there.
And, yeah, just that kind of stuff.
Have fun.
Black Lab, your final thought for today?
Let me think.
Um...
I have a paper due tomorrow morning that I need to finish when I get home.
Slacker.
Yeah, I'm right, I am.
And, uh, let's see.
The next time Twin says Mac suck, I'm gonna go down to Florida and take one of those puck mice from the early IMAX and shove it up his ass.
We don't wanna go to that area.
I don't wanna know about things going up Twin's ass.
Hey, I mean, uh, I don't know.
Mac?
Rob!
I'm not done with my final thought yet, dammit.
Damn it.
Damn it, you made me forget what I was going to say.
Wrong text.
Whatever.
Yeah, I had fun tonight.
Go meet.
No.
No, Loki, you're done.
I'll let him talk.
Loki.
Expect some more Guitar Freak's 7th and 8th music and also popping music stuff to be appearing in our playlist later this week.
Check it out.
Yes.
We actually already have some 8th and 7th in there, but popping music, per that email, we finally, we ordered our albums and we got them.
Wink wink.
So we'll be adding the popping music stuff like we promised we would this week.
And the Paula Tanberry's, the Paula Terry band is over now.
No, no it's not.
Oh, we're going to ban her for another week?
Banner for a month.
We'll banner until next year.
Alright, so Politary's banned for the rest of the year.
And my final thought is, I still need a date, but it looks like I might have one this week, so that's cool.
Shut up.
And I guess that's it.
I need to go play DDR because I'm getting fat.
And I don't like being fat.
That's it.
My turn.
Jamie, your final thought.
That's it.
That's it?
That's your final thought?
I guess Dave doesn't have a final thought.
Dave loses.
Dave doesn't have a single thought in his head.
Dave doesn't have a thought in his head.
Dave's final thought.
Oh yeah, Dave and Presto.
That was his final thought.
So what did you guys think of... Oh god.
Here he comes.
I passed Presto.
Yay.
I already said that.
Get out of here.
You're banned with Politary.
We're locking Impolitary in the closet.
What?
You and Impolitary are getting locked in the closet.
Coming next week... Coming next week is Impolitary Upskirt Cam.
Exclusive.
Oh.
Dear Diary, I went to open my closet and there was Impolitary with an underage American.
What was that cracker boy doing in my closet, you might ask?
Well, that will be in my next week's diary.
So what did you guys think of the three hour show?
That three hour trainwreck.
I was very disappointed there was no Gilligan's Island music in the intro.
I thought about it, but that's so cliche.
I promoted it as a three hour tour, so that was about it.
What did you think of three hours?
It's a hell of a lot better when you're actually in here.
Yeah.
And even though it's kind of a small room, it's a hell of a lot better sitting down on my computer and my ass getting numb from not moving.
It would have been better if we had a lot more Belmani news going on, but since everyone is kind of like, eh, nope.
Maybe we'll get out and do some interviews this week, so we'll have something to talk about next week.
We need to take care of the interviews from Shaft.
Yes, we're going to try and get that at some point.
I am very scared of the best of tape that you're going to put together here.
Coming soon, coming soon.
Do your worst.
And next week we need three microphones.
Just thought I'd mention that.
We'll see what we can do.
And another chair.
We'll see what we can do.
Oh, and the phone.
The magic phone box, too.
We can't do that.
We'll see what we can do.
Alright, thanks for listening, everybody.
We appreciate your support.
Stay tuned.
More Monty music to come after this very show.
And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, mother motherfucker.
Fuck, noice, noice, noice One, two, one, two, three, four Noice, noice, noice Smokin' weed, smokin' weirs Doin' coke, drinkin' beers Drinkin' beers, beers, beers Rollin' baddies, smokin' blunts Who smokes the blunts?
