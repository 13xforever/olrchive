00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Boring!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
This video stopped!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
See you later, friends on the next day!

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Hide or launch radio for the fucking children!

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
One.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
One.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Disco.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Missed it by that much.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
How can you tell?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I never forget a pussy.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Cat.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Thirty-seven. My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
In a row?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
You are the weakest link in the fight.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
So you get nothing.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You lose.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Good day, sir.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
I would like, if I may, to take you on a straight journey.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Dark Sakura.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Sky.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
No.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Everything alright?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.800
We are live, and this is episode number 19 for November the Tenored, is the way I wrote

02:13.800 --> 02:19.800
it on the script here, whoops, November Tenored, November 10th of 2002.

02:19.800 --> 02:26.560
Oh, it's been a long ass weekend, that's all I have to say.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.080
You're tuned into the Bahmani Scene's most shafted radio station of all things Bahmani.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.760
me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers,

02:37.760 --> 02:38.840
you know who better is Darksek Rock?

02:38.840 --> 02:42.000
I'm more on the funny farm.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
No comment.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.400
They're coming to take me away, they're coming to take me away.

02:46.400 --> 02:51.080
Say hello also to our newest co-host, although he has been here since the beginning, he's

02:51.080 --> 02:53.280
still the noob, say hello to Loki.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
Everybody.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.280
And that's it, it's just the three of us tonight.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.520
Dave couldn't get a ride here, he was begging me for one about an hour before the show started,

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
but...

03:02.520 --> 03:08.760
at home with my copy of freaking signed that bastard. Oh, do you have some hate mail for

03:08.760 --> 03:15.400
Dave? Well, let's wait until the F.U. is the week. Okay. We'll be talking to everybody

03:15.400 --> 03:20.400
else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a really quick break. I know.

03:20.400 --> 03:27.080
If you can't tell, my throat's slightly going today. And no, it's not from anything dirty.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.080
you sick bastards

03:30.080 --> 03:32.960
anyway uh... we got a lot of big announcements we got

03:32.960 --> 03:34.480
local news

03:34.480 --> 03:37.080
about the big tournament we had yesterday but that includes like

03:37.080 --> 03:39.680
everything we've got some

03:39.680 --> 03:46.360
show news including big changes coming next week coming to our website i think

03:46.360 --> 03:50.120
tonight as we speak at this very moment

03:50.120 --> 03:53.480
yeah we won't play the song changes you have nothing to worry about

03:53.480 --> 03:57.560
although and then uh... and i'd ask you to myself

03:57.560 --> 04:01.520
is also coming up later but it's something very very bad yesterday uh...

04:01.520 --> 04:04.760
very very bad and not

04:04.760 --> 04:08.480
i was a naughty boy

04:08.480 --> 04:09.560
not by you honey

04:09.560 --> 04:13.480
uh... claiming

04:13.480 --> 04:15.800
alone never mind and gave up the vote

04:15.800 --> 04:17.480
he just got the blame cuz he left

04:17.480 --> 04:19.160
and he was easily anyway

04:19.160 --> 04:23.360
It was all DDR Mike, he blamed you, he pointed the finger at you.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.880
Which sign, was it the...

04:25.880 --> 04:26.840
The movie, Signs.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.520
Signs, Noel Gibson, M. Night Challenge.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.800
Because Loki gets the hookup and gets the promo stuff, so he has a promo of Signs.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.380
Anyway, let's take a quick break, we're going to play the full

04:37.380 --> 04:41.700
remix version of one of the new Max USA License tunes.

04:41.700 --> 04:48.700
This is a speed remix of Venus with You Leave Me Alone here on Orange Lounge Radio.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.660
Oh I can't, oh I can't, oh I can't!

06:13.660 --> 06:32.660
Out of control, I'm missing you Because you're gonna hurt me

06:32.660 --> 06:37.660

Why do you leave me alone? Tell me why

07:08.160 --> 07:11.160

07:11.160 --> 07:16.160
Leave me alone if I'm not right

07:16.160 --> 07:20.160
And why you leave me alone so many days

07:20.160 --> 07:23.160
Just to give up you so many nights

09:29.120 --> 09:31.120
Don't tell me why

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
Don't tell me why

10:01.120 --> 10:31.080
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10:31.080 --> 10:38.080
You know what? I had Mel cracking up in the car today because I pointed out something

10:39.280 --> 10:43.280
to him that I noticed from day one. The one and only Mel B, right? Or are we talking Melody?

10:43.280 --> 10:47.780
Mel B. Alright. The QQQ sounds like ducks.

10:47.780 --> 10:52.780
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. Seriously, you're one of the bracelets. Well,

10:52.780 --> 10:56.700
Well, we played it during the pre-show, but uh QQQ

10:58.380 --> 11:01.900
You want me to pull up QQQ yeah folks, okay, let's listen now

11:01.900 --> 11:06.780
We're gonna pull this up and I want to take a you know a survey from the chat room here

11:06.780 --> 11:12.700
Tell me that this if this does or does not sound like ducks down to the laughter in the background

11:12.700 --> 11:29.020
it sounds like the music they play in the electric parade at dinky land.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.020
it's like a spiced up version of the chicken dance.

11:31.020 --> 11:37.980
No, I think it sounds like ducks, but it doesn't feel like chicken.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.940
Chat room, what do you think?

11:39.940 --> 11:41.940
It's not like ducks, am I right?

11:41.940 --> 11:43.940
Say yes.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.940
They said work, work, work.

11:45.940 --> 11:47.940
They must be a little bit behind you.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.940
Yay, there is the clown.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.940
Demon child laughter.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.940
Sounds like ducks.

11:53.940 --> 12:00.940
Or they're comparing it to the dying giraffe noise.

12:00.940 --> 12:03.940
bleh, bleh, bleh

12:30.940 --> 12:36.440
at a holic and then you get stoic. Yeah, that's your expression after listening to it. You're

12:36.440 --> 12:45.520
like just flat and stoic. Oh, lots of big news. My God. I know. Today is just one big

12:45.520 --> 12:50.640
sigh isn't it? I slept thirteen and a half hours. Did you really? Yes I did. I came home

12:50.640 --> 12:56.640
and took Vicodin. Well, let's fill everyone in that may have missed it. You know, we are

12:56.640 --> 13:03.180
Our international show, Orange Lounge Radio, for the International Bahmani community.

13:03.180 --> 13:06.580
But here in Sacramento, where we're based, as you probably may or may not know, in Northern

13:06.580 --> 13:10.940
California, we're based out of Sacramento, we had a huge tournament yesterday, Shaft.

13:10.940 --> 13:15.380
So we were all a big part of this, and we're all tired as fuck.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.400
And if any of you guys might have been tuned in for our live broadcast, Orange Lounge did

13:19.400 --> 13:21.900
broadcast the whole day live from Shaft.

13:21.900 --> 13:30.300
We cut it off around improv freestyle because it was starting to, yeah, there's only so

13:30.300 --> 13:32.180
much you can talk about at a tournament.

13:32.180 --> 13:38.720
I have to apologize for all those who did listen to the live broadcast, I hope you never

13:38.720 --> 13:41.660
have to be subjected to something that horrible ever again.

13:41.660 --> 13:45.300
I'll tell you what, you know what, it was interesting, it was experimental radio, there

13:45.300 --> 13:47.460
were some great highlights.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.460
I haven't listened to the archive yet, I do have an archive of it, I will be putting together

13:51.460 --> 13:54.500
some kind of best of as soon as I can get a hold of that archive file.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
Be gentle.

13:55.500 --> 14:00.020
I'm going to get some clips of Loki going insane, but there were some great moments.

14:00.020 --> 14:04.680
All I know is that I was standing on the Max 2 machine, and I looked over in the corner,

14:04.680 --> 14:09.660
and they'd taken the microphone, some of the folks that were helping us out, and drug it

14:09.660 --> 14:10.660
out the window.

14:10.660 --> 14:11.660
That was Evan.

14:11.660 --> 14:12.660
Yeah, it was Evan that did that.

14:12.660 --> 14:13.660
It was Evan that did that.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.580
I'm definitely going to talk about Evan a little bit here, too, because he did a great

14:15.580 --> 14:16.580
job.

14:16.580 --> 14:21.060
And the microphone was out the window, and Jahi was holding onto it, and I know this

14:21.060 --> 14:24.380
This is going to translate well to radio, but he was standing there and he's just going

14:24.380 --> 14:29.080
like this, looking like he's ranting about something and I'm like, there's quality radio

14:29.080 --> 14:33.280
going on in the corner right now, and I'm like, I so wish I could be there right now.

14:33.280 --> 14:38.640
But yes, a big, big thank you to everybody that helped out with that live broadcast yesterday

14:38.640 --> 14:41.200
because Jamie was so busy with tournament things.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.780
I was so busy with tournament things.

14:42.780 --> 14:47.600
We let the new Blokey kind of take the brunt of a lot of that towards the beginning, towards

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
the beginning.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
You did a fabulous job.

14:49.600 --> 14:55.900
I kept going in the back room, and kept just hearing the interviews going one after another,

14:55.900 --> 15:01.900
interviewing practically everybody who did an accuracy attack, and I just remember seeing

15:01.900 --> 15:09.520
a microphone in my face a few times going, huh, oh, we're live, I have to go over here

15:09.520 --> 15:10.880
now, bye.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.160
Just especially like a big thank you to everybody that helped out with that, Loki of course,

15:16.160 --> 15:23.120
Brad, Irene, JB, 23M, Jahi, just everybody that helped out.

15:23.120 --> 15:27.400
And a big, big thank you to Evan because he got really creative with it.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.960
Evan was born for Internet Radio.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.080
Can we have some fly boys over here?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.320
Evan is a fucking riot.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
I got judged.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.360
He sat at the judges.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.360
He wasn't a judge for freestyle, but he sat at the table for a little while and saw some

15:39.360 --> 15:40.360
forms.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.880
That's one contributing factor to how you guys ran out during improv freestyle, but

15:43.880 --> 15:44.880
that's okay.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.880
That's okay.

15:45.880 --> 15:50.060
judge me and he wrote down on the scene nice flaming blue shirt

15:50.060 --> 15:51.680
just all this funny stuff

15:51.680 --> 15:53.360
evan cracks me up and i wish

15:53.360 --> 15:55.680
i wish you could have been there the whole day

15:55.680 --> 15:56.360
just take

15:56.360 --> 15:59.480
to the kind of ease the tension but he's i'm gonna have to get him on the show

15:59.480 --> 16:00.840
he he's not

16:00.840 --> 16:01.960
he plays

16:01.960 --> 16:05.400
but money i think she's kind of a closet but money families not he's maybe played

16:05.400 --> 16:07.880
once or twice but he wouldn't

16:07.880 --> 16:10.680
be able to talk about it like we do but he's still funny

16:10.680 --> 16:13.500
so i have to get him on here sometime i think he might be listening so hello

16:13.500 --> 16:14.840
evan if you're listening

16:14.840 --> 16:21.540
He had to kind of play relief because I was very sick yesterday at the same time doing

16:21.540 --> 16:27.040
the radio show as anyone that listened realized, and I was losing my voice.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.400
In fact, I had pretty much lost my voice by the end of the day.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.040
And so, I was talking on the radio, trying to think of, it was pretty much me being sick

16:35.040 --> 16:41.220
and all like, just miserable, just ranting on about whatever came to mind.

16:41.220 --> 16:45.320
And it probably wasn't incoherent at parts, but uh...

16:45.320 --> 16:47.400
Much like early episodes of this very show.

16:47.400 --> 16:52.620
And it might as well just call it like, you know, deep thoughts from Loki yesterday.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.660
It's just... it was awful.

16:55.660 --> 16:56.900
It was so awful.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.900
Go donut.

16:57.900 --> 16:58.900
That's all I have to say.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.740
Go donut.

17:01.740 --> 17:07.160
Have you ever seen a beautiful, beautiful sunset, and a flamingo is flying across the

17:07.160 --> 17:08.160
sunset.

17:08.160 --> 17:14.160
Also, it's holding a rose in its beak and a painting in its paws...er, claws, I guess.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.160
Also, you're drunk.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.160
Another Deep Thought, by Jack Handy.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.660
That was beautiful.

17:20.660 --> 17:24.160
I have had a cry, thank you.

17:24.160 --> 17:28.160
I actually do actually have the Deep Thoughts book.

17:28.160 --> 17:33.160
I had three of them somewhere and I lost them all because I suck.

17:33.160 --> 17:37.160
I remember one day, we would go visit my Uncle Cave Band.

17:37.160 --> 17:42.160
We called him Uncle Caveman because he lived in a cave, and one day he would eat one of us.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
Later on we found out he was a bear.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.160
The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.160
I think my favorite deep thought of all time was,

17:54.160 --> 17:58.160
It's true that every time you hear a bell ring, an angel gets its wings.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.160
But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set

18:02.160 --> 18:10.120
on fire.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.120
So anyway, yes, Shaft!

18:12.120 --> 18:15.920
The big topic, it's weighing heavily on our minds.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.920
No wait, you're sitting on my face.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.920
No, I'm...

18:17.920 --> 18:21.000
No, the funny thing to tell a child is that when it rains, God is crying, probably because

18:21.000 --> 18:23.400
of something you did.

18:23.400 --> 18:33.280
Then there was one about how Disneyland burned down.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.720
I like to play jokes on my little cousins.

18:37.720 --> 18:45.680
One day our parents drove us to an abandoned warehouse that told us Disneyland burned down

18:45.680 --> 18:48.240
and then drove us home.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.240
It was like, I'd like to play jokes on little children.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.800
So I took my little, yeah.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.840
But it was getting pretty late.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.880
Yeah, we pieced it together in there somewhere.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.160
Yes, Shaft.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.000
Deep fried Twinkies.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.840
That's your mouth.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.840
Deep fried Twinkies.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.680
Oh my God.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.280
What DER tournament ever has deep fried Twinkies?

19:05.280 --> 19:06.880
Had a big sale nonetheless.

19:06.880 --> 19:11.840
We had the whole RTF versus Step Squad Twinkie eat out.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.680
I don't know that.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.560
Whoa, whoa.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.640
Did you just say the RTF Step Squad Twinkie eat out?

19:17.640 --> 19:22.640
I didn't mean it that way. My apologies.

19:22.640 --> 19:27.640
I don't know, apparently there was some sort of little mini...

19:27.640 --> 19:30.640
I think it was just teasing back at... Shut up!

19:30.640 --> 19:32.640
Last week on Org's Loud Show.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.640
If you use that, I'm going to kick you.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.640
No, but we were... basically it was just like...

19:39.640 --> 19:41.640
everyone was talking about the heart attack they were going to get,

19:41.640 --> 19:45.640
and then I hear something coming from a Kiyoki saying,

19:45.640 --> 19:47.800
I just took one for Step Squad.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.800
Took one what?

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
Twinkie?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.800
It was funny.

19:51.800 --> 19:57.040
And there was actually a guy there named Mr. Twinkie, which was pretty cool.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
Sir Twinkie, I'm sorry.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
Sir Twinkie.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.040
I met Sir Twinkie's mom.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
She was nice.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
Oh, very cool.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.560
There were some people that came in from out of town.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.480
I know there was a caravan that came in from Reno, a bunch from the bank.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.080
Biggest thanks to Fury for flying out from Omaha.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.200
Oh my lord.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.440
Omaha in the house.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.440
And some SoCal.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.040
leaders and your main expos from so-called

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
and my apologies for keep

20:17.520 --> 20:21.540
for constantly stay on the radio that is from kansas because i was sick and out

20:21.540 --> 20:22.520
of it

20:22.520 --> 20:23.940
i heard all the hospital

20:23.940 --> 20:25.340
kansas

20:25.340 --> 20:27.140
kansas nebraska

20:27.140 --> 20:28.840
california word and thank you

20:28.840 --> 20:29.400
uh...

20:29.400 --> 20:32.480
and california originally

20:32.480 --> 20:36.180
uh... and

20:36.180 --> 20:38.740
uh... what else about chapters there's so much talk about

20:38.740 --> 20:41.440
let's talk about the winning freestyle return all the freestyle really

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
Which I saw three pieces of.

21:11.440 --> 21:17.120
We'll get into that, but definitely I'd have to say my two favorites, you know, obviously

21:17.120 --> 21:21.000
first and second place, Trent Howard, you know, his routine was awesome.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.600
I only got to see that from this, and I was playing Max Two Guard during that time, so

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
I only got to see it from distance.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.520
There were too many people blocking the way, so I only, like, saw the top half of it, like

21:28.520 --> 21:29.680
it said, bobbing up and down.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.720
It was very, very, very good, and I did see it.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.720
It was so smooth.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.720
It was really nice.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.720
It was very good.

21:35.720 --> 21:43.720
awesome freestyler. Even his improv was right on. It was great. It looked like a routine.

21:43.720 --> 21:51.580
It was crazy. Then first place obviously went to Bruce Leroy and all I have to say is, man,

21:51.580 --> 21:53.120
that guy's got some funk in him.

21:53.120 --> 21:58.060
I have one thing to say about Wendell. Mm-mm, good.

21:58.060 --> 22:02.340
Yeah, I was actually just about to say, and our chat room is going crazy about it right

22:02.340 --> 22:06.060
now because wendell and i i can't remember the name of his partner do

22:06.060 --> 22:07.540
you remember who was like

22:07.540 --> 22:09.280
i feel like an ass

22:09.280 --> 22:11.300
okay thank you all yes holland i wasn't

22:11.300 --> 22:15.940
uh... they did this a hilarious routine that to uh... a d r song that

22:15.940 --> 22:21.940
usually annoys a lot of people

22:21.940 --> 22:23.300
uh...

22:23.300 --> 22:26.440
basically what they did it is the chat rooms going

22:26.440 --> 22:29.840
roast beef, roast beef, hot, hot, hot.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.840
And basically, they did this routine to this song

22:32.840 --> 22:36.760
where basically Wendell was fighting for a sandwich,

22:36.760 --> 22:37.640
kind of thing.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.240
The other guy had a sandwich, Holland had a sandwich,

22:40.240 --> 22:42.440
and just the way they were choreographed to the words

22:42.440 --> 22:45.960
was great, that was hilarious, I loved that.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.880
That was one of the better routines I saw all day,

22:47.880 --> 22:51.340
I thought, although really, every routine,

22:51.340 --> 22:53.280
I mean, I didn't, now, take it, keep in mind,

22:53.280 --> 22:56.040
I didn't get to stick around for improv freestyle,

22:56.040 --> 22:59.640
But every routine I saw that day was great. It really was.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.360
Now to point out some of the more hilarious routines, or I don't even know if we can call

23:03.360 --> 23:08.960
them routines, there was one that's, I don't even know who was doing it because there ended

23:08.960 --> 23:13.440
up being like six or seven people on the stage when it happened, is for Twilight Zone where

23:13.440 --> 23:17.720
they're doing the Mortal Kombat rendition there, that was hilarious.

23:17.720 --> 23:23.400
The Goro made that. The Goro thing where they're stomping on the ground, that was the shit.

23:23.400 --> 23:31.400
Also, notably, probably the most eyebrow-raising routine of the evening was about ten people

23:31.400 --> 23:37.200
all in the routine area doing It's Raining Men, and Irene the Rice Princess is a frequent

23:37.200 --> 23:40.760
contributor to the show, and also I think one of the world's only holders of an Orange

23:40.760 --> 23:45.120
Lounge t-shirt, which we don't even have, as host of the show.

23:45.120 --> 23:50.720
She just was up there singing, and she had her Fly Boys, oh yes, DDR-holic, Anita, was

23:50.720 --> 23:51.720
up there.

23:51.720 --> 23:57.000
Anita was doing the actual dancing so they wouldn't fail and then Irene was

23:57.000 --> 24:00.400
just singing and then they had fly boys and and if you'd heard Evan saying

24:00.400 --> 24:04.840
earlier in the evening I need some fly boys we need to get some fly boys and of

24:04.840 --> 24:09.080
course the first two people to speak up Sunia and Ry Ry two two cute younger

24:09.080 --> 24:14.960
girls are all we'll do it you're not a boy that's okay it was great I mean that

24:14.960 --> 24:17.840
was kind of a very eyebrow-raising routine where a lot of people just like

24:17.840 --> 24:27.840
I just remember walking by the Michigan Hill and seeing Bruce LeRoy with his hands in the air doing the swish, like he shot the perfect free throw.

24:27.840 --> 24:33.840
That was Bruce's routine, really, was swish. And that guy has come a long way. I did see a routine.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
He was wearing orange.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.840
The one tournament I ever was a freestyle judge at was an old Sac State tournament.

24:38.840 --> 24:45.840
And this was before Hypnotics and Bruce LeRoy were really well known as freestylers throughout the scene, and they were both there and they did an excellent job.

24:45.840 --> 24:58.400
Yes. Very good. I did see a little bit of the improv, and a little bit of what I saw was good.

24:58.400 --> 25:05.720
Improv, by the way, was a last-minute addition to Shaft, because we just wanted to keep it going.

25:05.720 --> 25:12.240
We had a few hiccups with attorney, which we'll come to in my fuck-y's of the week,

25:12.240 --> 25:18.320
week, but everything seems to go pretty good, and by the way, I have to say right now, a

25:18.320 --> 25:23.720
big congratulations to Orange Beanie for making, in his first tournament, fourth place.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.720
Yeah.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.760
And we're probably playing favorites because he's a Sacramento kid, but you know, we got

25:28.760 --> 25:29.760
to show some sacral love.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.760
Even so.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.760
Yeah, even so.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.760
To come in fourth place at your first tournament is quite a...

25:33.760 --> 25:38.160
You know, Jessica and I were talking a few weeks ago about how he came up and said, oh

25:38.160 --> 25:41.680
my god, how can you perfect attack so well?

25:41.680 --> 25:48.120
And to have him come up and do that well when only not too long ago he was, you know, looking

25:48.120 --> 25:53.000
up to all of us, that right there, he gets a big pause from me.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
All I gotta say is yesterday some of the most unorthodox things happened at that tournament.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.400
Let's start off with the set up with, you know, obviously we had fourth mix down that

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
day.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
Which I need to give a little bit of background on.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
Okay.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
Go ahead.

26:08.400 --> 26:13.760
I don't know how many people know about how a DDR machine works, but you have a CD that

26:13.760 --> 26:18.720
links up to a security card and the security card basically makes you able to play the

26:18.720 --> 26:19.720
disc.

26:19.720 --> 26:26.200
Well, what it is is they needed a cartridge that will sync the security card to the disc

26:26.200 --> 26:31.720
and their fourth mix came preloaded so they didn't have that cartridge because Melody

26:31.720 --> 26:36.600
was telling me that her solo did the same thing when it had damage done to it.

26:36.600 --> 26:42.880
So we got the card in, but they weren't synced, so the fourth mix stayed down.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.680
Another big thanks to Maple and Iguana Girl for going and modding those pads for us during

26:47.680 --> 26:52.320
the tournament so that we could have them to put on the stage instead of the fourth

26:52.320 --> 26:53.800
mix pads.

26:53.800 --> 26:59.800
We were going to hook up a fourth mix on the PS2, but we didn't have a third mix because

26:59.800 --> 27:01.800
of the transfer team.

27:01.800 --> 27:08.640
Sorry, I was just going to say a big congratulations to everybody that was involved getting the

27:08.640 --> 27:11.320
fourth mix situation to work.

27:11.320 --> 27:16.120
I think this is probably not the first time PlayStation has been used in a big tournament

27:16.120 --> 27:19.240
like this because I know a while back they were going to do something with the Club of

27:19.240 --> 27:21.920
Pens and OHA or something like that and I don't know if that ever happened or not.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.760
It was supposed to be at the last two-neck tournament.

27:24.760 --> 27:30.720
But certainly the simulator ending up having to use StepMania to do a third mix song just

27:30.720 --> 27:32.720
because there was just no options left.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.720
That was downright innovative.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.720
Let's give Matt the applause.

27:39.720 --> 27:44.720
Yes, me and my stupid sim, you know, I just happened to have my computer with me because

27:44.720 --> 27:48.720
I was using it for, well actually it was for the after party.

27:48.720 --> 27:53.720
I had my sim with me and everything and I have all the setup to rig everything together.

27:53.720 --> 27:58.720
So we went ahead and rigged it with my TV out onto the TV and we had the pads going

27:58.720 --> 28:04.940
through my inputs, and it worked great. We had a third mix after the Game of Love working

28:04.940 --> 28:12.580
there, and come to find out, it was for Tran Power. He was going to have to pull out otherwise,

28:12.580 --> 28:18.020
and he actually placed second, so he definitely thanked me enough times for that.

28:18.020 --> 28:21.520
We also, Fury, his only routine was on fourth.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.560
I know, and look at this. You've got two guys. You've got one guy who came all the way from

28:24.560 --> 28:28.540
Omaha for the tournament, and then you've got Tran, who hasn't really been very active

28:28.540 --> 28:33.100
in the scene for the past four months or so, you know, he hasn't been very active.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.780
He took a little hiatus, you know, whatever the reason be, personal whatever, but it was

28:35.780 --> 28:39.140
good, it was great to see him back and doing a freestyle again, and it would have been

28:39.140 --> 28:43.100
so awful to have to turn these guys away, but it was really a situation that was just

28:43.100 --> 28:44.100
out of our hands.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.100
There's nothing we could do.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.100
It turned out to work out well for them.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.360
And it worked out awesome.

28:47.360 --> 28:53.260
I'm so happy that all worked out, so big props to the 4th Mix repair people, I guess we'll

28:53.260 --> 28:54.260
call them that.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.260
Yes, thank you.

28:55.260 --> 29:03.660
We took a major hiccup and made it more of a productive burp.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.700
And a big thank you, I believe too, and I apologize if I get this wrong, I believe it

29:06.700 --> 29:09.660
was JM3P that brought the metal pad for Max USA?

29:09.660 --> 29:10.660
Yes, I think so.

29:10.660 --> 29:11.860
Yes, I think so too.

29:11.860 --> 29:14.380
Big thanks to the folks that helped that get set up.

29:14.380 --> 29:19.600
And a thank you to the DDR Spot staff that was there doing the videos, filling in for

29:19.600 --> 29:24.600
Thanks to Mike Ngo and AJ for taking care of filming all that for us.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.600
Also, one of the biggest thanks goes to, of course, Konami and Jason Enos for donating.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
Definitely.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.600
DVR Max, and a few t-shirts to give out for prizes.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.600
And hopefully, maybe we'll see Jason in a tournament in the future, maybe.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
Hopefully.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
If we can swing it.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.600
Hopefully we'll be able to.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
Hopefully we'll get something.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
Maybe we'll get Jason on the show someday.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
That would be nice.

29:47.600 --> 29:53.520
try that so we'll see so again we'll get a shaft best of together in the next

29:53.520 --> 29:58.160
couple weeks for this program Loki mentioned the after party that I had here

29:58.160 --> 30:03.240
at the house one thing after a tournament it's probably not the best

30:03.240 --> 30:08.200
idea to have a party honestly because everybody is so dead and so tired just

30:08.200 --> 30:11.800
especially amongst the staff you know if we weren't all local people maybe we'd

30:11.800 --> 30:15.800
have more energy in us but we were just so dead we just all kind of sat here and

30:15.800 --> 30:20.080
watched movies and played video games but I do have one thing I have to say

30:20.080 --> 30:28.200
about last night. I love the power glove. It's so bad.

30:28.320 --> 30:33.960
Yeah well just keep your power gloves off for a pat huh? That's all I have to say.

30:33.960 --> 30:45.160
Thank you. Yeah I was exhausted after you know we were supposed to be having fun

30:45.160 --> 30:48.880
stuff and I had a major headache you know being sick and everything and I

30:48.880 --> 30:53.680
came back and I set up my metal pads and all that and of course every time I

30:53.680 --> 30:57.160
set my metal pads and they never worked the first time and I ended up having to

30:57.160 --> 31:01.120
dissect these damn things to get them to work so that took forever and finally

31:01.120 --> 31:04.280
got it done everyone started playing I sat there on the couch we watched the

31:04.280 --> 31:09.320
movie and it's just as all fuzzy from there I fell asleep and just slept until

31:09.320 --> 31:14.240
till morning. I was so tired.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.040
We just found out the weasel here, the weasel in the studio. Introduce the weasel to our

31:18.040 --> 31:29.040
listeners. His name is Baby Bush Baby. Anyway, so I'm getting the sense in the chat room

31:29.040 --> 31:32.720
and if you want to join our chat room, you're just going to join any other side IRC server

31:32.720 --> 31:36.920
and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge. I'm getting the sense that some of

31:36.920 --> 31:40.160
the people who weren't here in town are kind of left here with question marks

31:40.160 --> 31:42.680
over their head right now so let's let's talk about something a little more

31:42.680 --> 31:45.920
adaptable to folks that are listening to us international what were some things

31:45.920 --> 31:49.240
that we learned from the tournament that other people can take to their

31:49.240 --> 31:52.200
tournaments have the initial d-game there because people love to go to our

31:52.200 --> 31:59.040
vehicle to play it well it happened and people that are available to go play

31:59.040 --> 32:03.760
make sure that you have backups for everything that you do make sure that

32:03.760 --> 32:05.760
You have plenty of paper for the printers.

32:05.760 --> 32:10.980
Make sure that you have one cash box.

32:10.980 --> 32:16.060
Make sure it's better to have a big staff because things will run a lot smoothly if

32:16.060 --> 32:17.720
you've got everything coordinated.

32:17.720 --> 32:24.160
The staff this year was probably three times as big as last year and it helped immensely.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.760
This made me feel very good to hear that lots of people came up and said that we had a very

32:27.760 --> 32:28.840
efficient staff.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.120
Oh, good.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.280
That's a very good compliment.

32:33.280 --> 32:38.540
Make sure, you know, I thought it was a great idea that we had Elektra Tal as our backup

32:38.540 --> 32:39.540
NCE.

32:39.540 --> 32:44.460
I am especially glad because after you guys added that other tournament and my voice was

32:44.460 --> 32:48.480
already starting to go, I was like, eh, but Tal took the reins on that and from what I

32:48.480 --> 32:50.240
understand did a fabulous job.

32:50.240 --> 32:55.000
Unfortunately I had to get to the house before anybody else did to get the party started.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.860
Make sure that if you're going to introduce another portion of the tournament the day

32:59.860 --> 33:03.540
of the tournament that you had back up to just because our judges did look pretty tired.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.700
I'm sorry guys, but thank you for sticking it out like that.

33:06.700 --> 33:11.140
Well, I mean we kind of expected it would be that long anyway, but A-team unfortunately

33:11.140 --> 33:14.980
with the fourth mix problems didn't catch on, so to speak.

33:14.980 --> 33:19.740
So we're going to have to just do it again.

33:19.740 --> 33:24.300
Really I think that everything else went as smoothly as it possibly could, and everything

33:24.300 --> 33:27.540
seemed to flow except for the change over to the fourth mix.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.660
Yeah, that was a big stop.

33:29.660 --> 33:34.460
A little bit, we hear a little bit, we had a little bit too much time in between each

33:34.460 --> 33:39.780
freestyle routine, but do remember that one big thing that we like to do here in Sacramento

33:39.780 --> 33:41.700
with the tournaments is feedback.

33:41.700 --> 33:46.100
And when the judges are not just giving scores, they're giving comments and suggestions on

33:46.100 --> 33:48.500
how to better the freestyle, and that all takes a little bit of time.

33:48.500 --> 33:53.300
So we tried best we could to kind of get people up there and interview them, and we had some

33:53.300 --> 33:54.300
good stuff.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.380
We had some great in-between stuff.

33:55.380 --> 33:59.900
Brand got up there and did a hilarious imitation of...

33:59.900 --> 34:04.300
I don't know what you'd call him, but it was funny.

34:04.300 --> 34:11.340
Bruce Leroy did a great improv little beatbox thing, which was great.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.340
I did hear that.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.340
That was awesome.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.340
That was cool.

34:14.340 --> 34:18.820
I think they did that on Orange Lounge a little later, too, so that was cool, too.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.820
Great stuff.

34:20.820 --> 34:24.500
I was as frazzled as I was.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.580
I had a good time and I got hugged a lot.

34:27.580 --> 34:29.740
That's the best part of a tournament, isn't it?

34:29.740 --> 34:32.580
Isn't that the best part of a tournament is just random drive-by huggings?

34:32.580 --> 34:33.580
Yes, it was nice.

34:33.580 --> 34:34.580
It made me feel happy.

34:34.580 --> 34:38.420
But the best comments that I could have heard the whole time that I kept hearing is that

34:38.420 --> 34:43.540
we had a good time and, you know, just hearing we had a good time and when's the next one.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.900
That made me feel really good.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.980
Whole tournament set up actually reminded me of sort of an anime convention because

34:48.980 --> 34:53.360
Because we had like, you know, it was just kind of crazy and you had people doing their

34:53.360 --> 34:56.500
own thing everywhere, like watching movies on their laptops.

34:56.500 --> 35:01.980
We had, you know, I was kind of bored at certain points, you know, before we actually got the

35:01.980 --> 35:02.980
tournament running.

35:02.980 --> 35:05.400
And so we had people playing DDR Max on metal pad.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.820
We had someone else playing StepMania on a sim.

35:08.820 --> 35:15.980
I had, you know, people were playing the DDR Max 2 on free play and I had my sim sitting

35:15.980 --> 35:20.660
there because we were using my computer for the PA system and I was playing

35:20.660 --> 35:25.940
through there too and and of course because what what term it would be you

35:25.940 --> 35:31.060
know without Tanook Tanook we went ahead and played that too during one of the big

35:31.060 --> 35:36.780
breaks and also played one of those ah shit I can't remember the artist you know we

35:36.780 --> 35:43.620
played B4U what was it a coup to what I forget what it's called

35:43.620 --> 36:07.940
What was the biggest advice we could give from Sacramento to the rest of the world from

36:07.940 --> 36:09.540
what we learned this weekend?

36:09.540 --> 36:10.540
Make your tournament fun.

36:10.540 --> 36:13.540
That's the number one priority you need to have when scheduling a tournament.

36:13.540 --> 36:14.540
Fun, fun, fun.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.540
Keep the drama away from your tournament.

36:17.540 --> 36:19.940
If you've got something going on behind the scenes, you don't need to let the rest of

36:19.940 --> 36:20.940
the people know it.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.900
As far as they need to see, things are running fine.

36:24.900 --> 36:30.100
And really, it wasn't, I mean, there were, sure there were things falling apart behind

36:30.100 --> 36:31.100
the scenes.

36:31.100 --> 36:34.820
I wouldn't say falling apart, but you know, just problems, but they were solved and there

36:34.820 --> 36:36.440
was no drama.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.440
There really wasn't.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.900
At least not that I really saw.

36:38.900 --> 36:43.220
maybe I'm just ignorant but I didn't see any drama which is great so I think

36:43.220 --> 36:47.580
there almost was with some people that were there but we won't make comments on

36:47.580 --> 36:53.660
those people you know and on any of that just that I want to thank people who

36:53.660 --> 36:59.380
kept their patience you know with certain situations poopy on drama yeah

36:59.380 --> 37:04.740
poo-poo all right the feces we are going to take a quick break and when we come

37:04.740 --> 37:11.100
back I'm being told that around eight o'clockish that DSCS SoCal kicks our

37:11.100 --> 37:16.300
buddy down in SoCal who is being our HTML whore basically because I can't

37:16.300 --> 37:19.700
seem to get our old website updated anymore because it's just over my head

37:19.700 --> 37:25.020
so he said okay you suck I'm gonna just do the damn site so I'm like cool so

37:25.020 --> 37:29.260
he's been working very hard on it and I believe he's gonna have it done tonight

37:29.260 --> 37:32.580
and we're gonna look at the site on the very show and we're gonna peruse it and

37:32.580 --> 37:35.760
to give our feedback, our instant feedback.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.960
I'm sure we're all going to love them forever.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.380
So we'll be talking about some show stuff

37:40.380 --> 37:41.280
right after the break.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.520
Things that you'll want to hear if you're

37:43.520 --> 37:44.480
a fan of Orange Lounge.

37:44.480 --> 37:45.480
And we thank you for listening.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.220
We're going to start this off with a song

37:47.220 --> 37:49.400
we heard a lot of yesterday, and we just

37:49.400 --> 37:51.440
still can't get enough of it.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.720
Not Sugaru, don't worry.

37:53.720 --> 37:54.640
No, not Sugaru.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.000
Not the accuracy attack song.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.520
How about the freestyle song of the day, shall we?

37:58.520 --> 37:59.640
All right, here we go.

38:29.640 --> 38:36.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

38:36.640 --> 38:44.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

38:44.640 --> 38:48.640
I'll take it all out from where

38:48.640 --> 38:51.640
They're all that I need, yeah

38:51.640 --> 38:55.640
I'll take it all out from where

38:55.640 --> 39:00.640
We stand on the edge of the edge

39:00.640 --> 39:05.640
For the woman let's drive

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
For the woman

39:07.640 --> 39:10.640
You're the one I'd like to try.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.640
Everybody pull that chick down

40:24.040 --> 40:25.540
Come on, let's jump, here we go

40:25.540 --> 40:26.340
Jump, jump, jump, jump

40:26.340 --> 40:27.740
Everybody just get up, up, up, up

40:27.740 --> 40:28.740
This is what I get down

40:30.040 --> 40:31.540
Get it on, come on, come on

40:31.540 --> 40:32.740
Jump, jump, jump, jump

40:32.740 --> 40:33.240
Let's go

40:33.240 --> 40:34.740
Everybody pull that chick down

41:04.740 --> 41:08.740
I have powers that people have served as a pro at this point.

42:34.740 --> 43:02.340
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Melby can join

43:02.340 --> 43:07.020
us on all the fun together. Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

43:07.020 --> 43:11.420
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

43:11.420 --> 43:16.220
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

43:16.220 --> 43:22.300
best things in life are free. That's right, our buddy Mel B, who was in the studio literally

43:22.300 --> 43:27.060
minutes before we went on Airbnb, but unfortunately they have a long trip ahead of them and couldn't

43:27.060 --> 43:30.820
really stick around. But we thank them for being here this weekend because I know they

43:30.820 --> 43:38.300
both were helping out immensely with the tournament this weekend so how'd that go

43:38.300 --> 43:42.500
I think we went to the same Mongolian barbecue place though I believe Friday

43:42.500 --> 43:48.880
and today crashing out last night while I was making a special banner for Wendell

43:48.880 --> 43:59.740
in in a tribute to his a roast beefy goodness really roast beef anyway so uh

43:59.740 --> 44:02.740
It was pretty good. Now I'm going to go get my taquitos.

44:29.740 --> 44:32.700
and how he's currently expanding his pornography collection.

44:32.700 --> 44:33.700
Beautiful.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.740
That's always a good idea.

44:35.740 --> 44:36.780
Got to keep a variety.

44:36.780 --> 44:37.900
Hooray for pornography.

44:37.900 --> 44:43.100
Speaking of pornography, they were watching yesterday

44:43.100 --> 44:44.260
at the tournament.

44:44.260 --> 44:46.580
Yes, we're talking about pornography, Jamie.

44:46.580 --> 44:47.900
You miss all the good stuff.

44:52.260 --> 44:55.540
Dave's getting pissed in the chat room

44:55.540 --> 44:58.140
because he brought those taquitos for the party

44:58.140 --> 44:58.980
last night.

44:58.980 --> 45:05.980
but we were so dead that nobody thought to cook them. Thank you for my dinner, Dave.

45:05.980 --> 45:12.980
First we don't give him a ride here, and then we eat his food. We are such assholes.

45:13.420 --> 45:17.540
I'm not an asshole, I'm a bitch. Give me a ride.

45:17.540 --> 45:20.780
Oh, God, where the fuck was I?

45:20.780 --> 45:24.180
I don't know anymore. I don't care.

45:24.180 --> 45:28.700
We were talking about...

45:28.700 --> 45:32.580
shaft? No, we were talking about, um... Oh, porn! We were talking about porn!

45:32.580 --> 45:36.700
Dear God, how could I forget? We were talking about pornography.

45:36.700 --> 45:40.380
And the tournament yesterday, um,

45:40.380 --> 45:44.100
at the tournament yesterday, on the little iMac, they were watching the

45:44.100 --> 45:47.020
dirty video by Christina Aguilera, in between

45:47.020 --> 45:51.580
the Titanium Power book, yes, watching Christina Aguilera dirty, and then they were

45:51.580 --> 45:53.820
watching, I believe, the Girls Gone Wild videos.

45:53.820 --> 45:57.420
I missed the... The melody made for, uh,

45:57.420 --> 46:01.420
Did she make the disc for Islander?

46:01.420 --> 46:04.420
She made it, and then Mike no took it.

46:04.420 --> 46:07.420
Aw man, I missed the Girls Gone Wild videos.

46:07.420 --> 46:10.420
Oh gee, I miss all the good shit at tournaments.

46:10.420 --> 46:16.420
We do agree though that next time we do an Orange Lounge live broadcast from a tournament,

46:16.420 --> 46:23.420
we're going to actually go to the tournament as participants and not staff.

46:23.420 --> 46:28.420
And then we're going to demand that we be allowed a sports center in the back of the room.

46:28.420 --> 46:33.420
We don't have to be in front of the machine, but in the back of the room so we can actually see the machine instead of being...

46:33.420 --> 46:41.420
You know, to add to the whole porn thing, I could have brought about a couple hundred tapes of Playboy videos to pass out along the DVDs,

46:41.420 --> 46:43.420
but I thought that wouldn't be family oriented.

46:43.420 --> 46:47.420
No, that's not a family fun center function, unfortunately.

46:47.420 --> 46:51.980
Now, uh, you know, maybe at a different kind of, maybe for the next edit contest?

46:51.980 --> 46:56.120
Oh, that should be your next edit contest, Loki's Edit Contest of Pornography.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.120
Make edit get porn.

46:58.120 --> 47:00.320
Make edit get porn. Beautiful.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.720
That should be like a, that should be an international thing.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.920
I think Orange Lounge needs to sponsor that contest.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.320
Make edit get porn.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.820
All right, you heard it here.

47:12.820 --> 47:13.320
All right.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.720
I will do this.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.220
I will do this that you ask.

47:16.220 --> 47:33.220
Alright, the Make-Edit-Get-Porn contest. Details coming soon. To get those details, you'll

47:33.220 --> 47:40.940
want to log on to our website, which is currently being reinvented as we speak, and I'm waiting

47:40.940 --> 47:56.220
I'm waiting for the word from SoCal Kicks to SoCal Kicks and everything's finished and

47:56.220 --> 47:57.800
we'll go look at the new site.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
And we'll-

47:58.800 --> 48:00.820
Save me some boy porn and I'll do it.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.460
Do you have any boy porn?

48:02.460 --> 48:06.580
Not really, no.

48:06.580 --> 48:10.220
But maybe there's a guy on girl porn that actually shows the guy.

48:10.220 --> 48:17.220
I mean, well, we've got, I know for a fact they can get a whole ton of Playboy videos.

48:17.220 --> 48:22.500
For like the last eight months, I have every single video that's been released, and they're

48:22.500 --> 48:23.500
all crap.

48:23.500 --> 48:28.180
I mean, they're great, but no, it's just, I don't know.

48:28.180 --> 48:33.140
They have their own series that's called Playboy Exposed that's actually like Girls Gone Wild,

48:33.140 --> 48:36.940
except kind of even more ridiculous, but whatever.

48:36.940 --> 48:39.020
Completely off topic from Imani, anything?

48:39.020 --> 48:43.380
I heard they're making a movie out of Girls Gone Wild, but it's going to be like actual

48:43.380 --> 48:48.160
actresses who portray these sorority girls that end up participating in the videos.

48:48.160 --> 48:55.660
It sounds like Porky's 3 or something.

48:55.660 --> 48:58.780
It'll be bigger than jackass, I guarantee it.

48:58.780 --> 49:00.640
And this is inside news for everyone.

49:00.640 --> 49:08.280
I read today on Weekly World News, okay, that, um, that Nostradamus predicted that Britney

49:08.280 --> 49:10.760
Spears is going to convert to Islam.

49:10.760 --> 49:13.400
Nostradamus predicted it, then it must be true.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.400
Yes.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.600
You might want to have to dispute this rumor going on in the chat room here, Loki.

49:17.600 --> 49:21.360
I don't know what you have to say about this, but you need to set something straight, so

49:21.360 --> 49:22.360
to speak.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.360
I prefer Playgirl.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.360
I've never even seen Playgirl.

49:25.360 --> 49:28.200
What the hell is that?

49:28.200 --> 49:29.200
SoCal kicks just being a jerk.

49:29.200 --> 49:34.200
No, I've just not turned on about the fact that they don't really do anything.

49:34.200 --> 49:37.200
I mean, all the movies are exactly the same.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.200
They all put them in situations where they start feeling themselves up for no apparent reason.

49:41.200 --> 49:47.200
They appear to try to have sex, but for some reason just get nowhere near having sex.

49:47.200 --> 49:53.200
I mean, granted, there are some movies that are pretty good, but they're not the ones that are actually like, you know,

49:53.200 --> 50:00.680
Playboy Girls of whatever or something like that, but the actual ones like I had I just got a sex court TV the movie

50:07.200 --> 50:09.200
And this one's actually pretty sweet, but

50:10.280 --> 50:11.800
We're fine

50:11.800 --> 50:13.840
There's no bimani talk tonight. Just porn

50:15.440 --> 50:17.820
This one's actually pretty pretty cool. You've got um

50:17.820 --> 50:25.140
Julia Strains in it, she's pretty famous, and actually Sexcore TV is a really live show

50:25.140 --> 50:31.740
that they have on Playboy TV, where they, it's really stupid, it's like, my girlfriend

50:31.740 --> 50:37.620
doesn't let me go down on her, well your punishment is you let him go down on you, in my courtroom

50:37.620 --> 50:44.060
on the show right now, and that's what happens, it's kind of stupid, but, oh oh, and I have

50:44.060 --> 50:56.060
I have to add, I forget what their booth is or whatever, but it's this giant seashell bed thing that looks like something out of a Little Mermaid porno sequence or something like that.

50:56.060 --> 51:07.060
It's the weirdest thing. But that's definitely a good movie. Plus I have a couple of other ones that are really strange. I just had to get it because I saw the poster for it and it was just funny.

51:07.060 --> 51:09.060
Playmate of the Apes.

51:09.060 --> 51:12.060
That one's hilarious.

51:12.060 --> 51:27.060
I was just gonna say, I've only ever seen two porn. One of them was the boneheads, like the coneheads with collapsible tops. As in inwardly collapsible, so they could use them. And Final Fuck X.

51:27.060 --> 51:29.060
Final Fuck X is a winner.

51:29.060 --> 51:32.860
Well okay, I have to add that these aren't true pornos, these are softcore porn.

51:32.860 --> 51:33.860
Oh!

51:33.860 --> 51:34.860
Skinemax porn!

51:34.860 --> 51:35.860
Yeah, Skinemax porn.

51:35.860 --> 51:40.460
Okay, now, if you want to get some good porn, you need to definitely go with the Vivid

51:40.460 --> 51:41.460
DVDs.

51:41.460 --> 51:42.460
Vivid DVDs are awesome.

51:42.460 --> 51:47.620
I mean, the extras on them are worth another movie right there, plus a lot of them are

51:47.620 --> 51:48.620
like a twofer.

51:48.620 --> 51:52.900
You get one movie plus bonus features, plus another movie with bonus features, so a definite

51:52.900 --> 51:53.900
way to go.

51:53.900 --> 51:58.620
You've got like six hours worth of porn per DVD, so go for that.

51:58.620 --> 52:00.940
I realize this says I'm eating a taquito.

52:00.940 --> 52:06.180
When next time you're sick of DDR and you need something else to do, go buy yourself

52:06.180 --> 52:07.180
some vivid porn.

52:07.180 --> 52:12.260
Well, I know, in the Sacramento area, I mean, in the Sacramento area, I know that you can

52:12.260 --> 52:18.020
go to Video Clearance Center, they've got porn as cheap as like two bucks, so go there

52:18.020 --> 52:19.740
and check it out, man.

52:19.740 --> 52:23.220
You are pretty much being worshipped in the chat room right now.

52:23.220 --> 52:25.780
And another bit of money in the news.

52:25.780 --> 52:32.180
Loki knows his porno, and remind me when I go to NorCal to go to Loki's, and Loki is

52:32.180 --> 52:33.700
pornified.

52:33.700 --> 52:37.380
And porn on talk on Orange Lounge, I never thought I would see today.

52:37.380 --> 52:38.380
I have a taquito.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.380
It's pornographic.

52:39.380 --> 52:40.380
You have a taquito?

52:40.380 --> 52:42.340
I don't know.

52:42.340 --> 52:47.300
And then we have a comment, porn and orange chicken, which, you know, yesterday at the

52:47.300 --> 52:53.400
tournament, take this back to Imani a little bit, you brought over some Boston Market,

52:53.400 --> 52:54.400
and you got a half chicken.

52:54.400 --> 53:23.480
It was hilarious because they were trying to pass me a demo of the scorecard sheet thing

53:23.480 --> 53:29.480
My hands were all greasy and sticky from, you know, the chicken, from the goddamn chicken.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.480
Okay? The chicken was damn good.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.480
Get him a norelco for those palms.

53:34.480 --> 53:40.480
Okay. But the chicken was very greasy, so, you know, obviously I was just, you know, going,

53:40.480 --> 53:44.480
uh, don't hand me that because I don't want to touch that, you know, get all these grease marks all over it.

53:44.480 --> 53:46.480
But good chicken.

53:46.480 --> 53:52.480
The answer that nobody did give, though. We got grape soda, we got porn, nobody said waffles.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.480
Chicken and waffle!

54:22.480 --> 54:33.480
I will cut you. Orange Lounge is great. Showgirls is like the greatest movie ever because it is so bad.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.480
But I like watching train wreck cinema.

54:35.480 --> 54:40.480
I like watching your bump and grind on people so that was all worth it for me.

54:40.480 --> 54:47.480
And in other Bimani news, I like DDR. I like Beatmania.

54:47.480 --> 54:52.480
Apparently, other people like Beat It mania.

54:52.480 --> 55:00.480
You know, DDRaholic says I may not be a guy, but I like porn.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.480
Amen sister, we need more porn freaks in this world.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.480
Porn is funny.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.480
My girlfriend likes porn.

55:07.480 --> 55:08.480
An ideal woman.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.480
She likes porn more than I do.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
Hey.

55:11.480 --> 55:14.480
I like boy porn.

55:14.480 --> 55:35.160
Jamie is a yaoi fanatic as she shoves her iron fist of justice into the air.

55:35.160 --> 55:40.100
So just when we're starving to get a new topic, I have SoCal Kicks in this typical IRC way

55:40.100 --> 55:46.760
way, telling me 40 times in the chat room, line after line, that he has finished.

55:46.760 --> 55:54.040
So let's see what we get if we go to our website right now at orangelounge.skie.cx.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.040
We're gonna go to it right now.

55:55.040 --> 55:56.040
Here we go.

55:56.040 --> 55:57.040
Loading, loading, loading.

55:57.040 --> 56:04.480
It says, oh, we've got the big fat orange, and it says welcome.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.360
I feel like we should be playing the big O theme.

56:37.360 --> 56:44.360
this is pretty sick that here we are, the host of the show, we don't know a damn thing

56:44.880 --> 56:51.880
about our own website alright, before we go to the website, we can click right here on

56:53.080 --> 56:59.600
the main page, let's see what we get ooh, Orange Lounge, welcome to the newly redesigned

56:59.600 --> 57:06.200
Orange Lounge site, thanks to me, SoCalKick, yes, thanks to you

57:06.200 --> 57:10.480
This site will be very easy to run to the point Rob can even update it, hahaha, oh I

57:10.480 --> 57:11.480
appreciate that.

57:11.480 --> 57:15.960
Well now, all pages are very under construction as Sky himself goes in and makes this site

57:15.960 --> 57:16.960
his own.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.480
Well, you know, Jamie and Cloak, you might want to participate too.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.480
We're going to have pictures.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
Different pictures.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.040
Yes, we'll have new pictures, because we don't want to-

57:24.040 --> 57:25.720
Or it actually looks like my nose.

57:25.720 --> 57:29.160
We don't want to be supermodels anymore, we're just going to take, we're going to jump in

57:29.160 --> 57:30.160
the garbage can and take a private life.

57:30.160 --> 57:32.440
I will no longer look like Barbra Streisand.

57:32.440 --> 57:35.040
You did not look like Barbra Streisand.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.040
The nose was.

57:36.040 --> 57:37.040
The nose was.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.040
Oh, no.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.040
I think it looked cute.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.040
The nose was not my nose.

57:40.040 --> 57:41.040
But that's okay.

57:41.040 --> 57:44.040
We'll take new pics just because people want updated pictures of ourselves.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.040
Yes.

57:45.040 --> 57:47.040
Of ourselves in the singular.

57:47.040 --> 57:50.040
Rob, is there something you're not telling us?

57:50.040 --> 57:51.040
How many of you live in there?

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
Knock, knock!

57:52.040 --> 57:53.040
Forty.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.040
In a row.

57:54.040 --> 57:55.040
Thirty-seven.

57:55.040 --> 58:04.040
Try not to get into more personalities on your way out of the parking lot.

58:04.040 --> 58:09.040
Let's see, let's see, for now be sure to listen to Orange Lounge Radio. Yes, good point. Be sure to listen.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
Always, every day.

58:10.040 --> 58:12.040
Every second.

58:12.040 --> 58:18.040
Visit the Live 365 page for more info and a direct link goes to the station site.

58:18.040 --> 58:22.040
And now if you know me well, you know I like whoring out SCK, so here goes nothing.

58:22.040 --> 58:29.040
And then he hoars out, continues to whore out the Friday, November 15th launch date of SoCalKicks.com version 5.0.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.040
Yes.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.040
Beautiful.

58:31.040 --> 58:35.040
Let's see if we have anything on these different pages yet.

58:35.040 --> 58:39.040
Oh, no, it just says under construction.

58:39.040 --> 58:43.040
Under construction. Oh, here's what it says for chat. Under construction.

58:43.040 --> 58:47.040
No, wait. For now, I just won't make it pretty and just say what's needed.

58:47.040 --> 58:52.040
The channel is Orange Lounge and can be found on any other IRC.otherside.net server such as IRC.acontrol.org and others.

58:52.040 --> 58:56.040
Very nice. Very pretty. Oh, forums.

58:56.040 --> 59:00.040
Under construction. Of course. Cast.

59:00.040 --> 59:03.040
Oh, come on, Sokal Kix, I know you know who's on cast.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.040
That's alright.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.040
It looks very pretty.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.040
Uh, music.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.040
Normal links.

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
Nothing.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.040
Links.

59:10.040 --> 59:13.040
Under construction, but here's your first link.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.040
Hey, Sacre Mani needs to be on there.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
And there's the link to Sokal Kix.

59:17.040 --> 59:19.040
In the upcoming, we will have...

59:19.040 --> 59:22.040
Might I add, that's one giant link banner.

59:22.040 --> 59:28.040
I'll just have to make, like, one's just as big for Sacre Mani as CDR3 and CDR5.

59:28.040 --> 59:29.040
That's huge.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.040
That's huge.

59:31.040 --> 59:34.040
It's huge! It's like an orange found on a toothpick!

59:34.040 --> 59:40.040
Wow, so the site is very pretty, and we appreciate DSCS and all his hard work.

59:40.040 --> 59:44.040
So a big kisses from all of us to DSCS.

59:50.040 --> 59:54.040
Well, be sure you're involved in any future Twinkie Eating competitions.

59:55.040 --> 59:58.040
Yes, you too can eat out of Twinkie.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:06.360
I have to scream out his slogan. Should we scream it out in agony, ecstasy, pain? How

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.720
should we scream out his slogan?

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:19.720
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.520
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just now.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.240
That was very ingrishy.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.240
Thank you.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240
will get to club.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:38.180
So there we go. Oh, in Rave style! I like that idea. Let's say his slogan, in Rave style.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.580
Yes, I like that idea. Let's do that. Let's do it that way. I have to go find my glow

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.900
sticks real fast, then I can come back and do this in Rave style.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.140
I don't want to know where your glow sticks are.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:54.140
S.C.K. Accomplishes Ultimate Evolution Just Now!

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.780
RS for great justice move orange lounge

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.740
And anyway

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.540
Let's take it. We're gonna take another quick break. Yes, sir

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.700
Rob can like go put his glow sticks away and then we're gonna come back

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.180
We're just gonna be a quick break and we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk about

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.020
We'll do a little dream do a happy hopper in this break. We're gonna do silhouette of my mind in this break

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.020
We're going from extremes here.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.020
Yes, we're going from very happy to very wrist-slitting-ish.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:56.020
Actually, we're going to go the other way around. We're going to go from wrist-slitting to happy.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:01.020
I look as the blood splashes upon the blackness of my soul.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.020
Woe is me. I dread everything.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.020
I'm so goth that when the night comes, so do I.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:11.020
SCK accomplishes Ultimate Evolution.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.020
Welcome to goth talk.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.020
And I'm Asriel of the Sea Prince of Sorrow!

01:02:44.020 --> 01:03:07.020
A mask inside of me, trapped in a motion Where I want to go with you

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:13.020
I need to leave, I need to let go

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:21.020
Of all the friends and thoughts inside my mind

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:25.020
From all the chains that bind

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:31.020
How can I find my way through you?

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.520
When it's broken and there's no one left

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.520
I keep reaching for my hand

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.520
For all the secrets, secrets of my heart

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.020
Reaching to take my hand

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:55.520
To trace the silhouette of my mind

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.520
Like a child

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.520
How can I find my way to you?

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.020
I don't care what I don't know

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:26.520
You can't see the red of my blood

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:07.640
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.320
Watch all your favorite monster hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki engage in the Bahmani

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.320
Battle Royale.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.000
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, at 7 p.m. Pacific Time, heads will roll and arrows will scroll.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, be suitable for children under 6, pregnant women, retards, and residents of Baltimore.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Are you ready?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Are you ready for the race?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Are you ready?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Are you ready?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we're back.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Two residents of Omaha.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And we're live.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Huh?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Two residents of Omaha.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Residents of Baltimore.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Oh.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
No, I wouldn't do that.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.320
Well, remember that the reason why I said F.U. to Baltimore was because they were the

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.940
lowest ranked on the list of what cities are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.000
I think they had a whopping, like, second.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.300
who

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.320
somebody must have turned it on like right at the moment we were playing like

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.480
uh... the new wesley willis promo or something i just didn't get it

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.560
uh...

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.480
know cuz we do not play let them move

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.560
on orange lounge radio

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.360
uh... one thing

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.600
uh... this piece of the shower we have a new we have a new face the chat room

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.800
tank i don't recognize uh... this person new person he's saying that

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.880
while the musical variety is making me feel like a teen girl and that's really

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.780
big

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.780
I'm as happy as a little girl.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.780
This is the time of Sprookus when we dance?

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.780
This is the part when I want to dance when we dance.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.780
A big welcome to all our new chatters. I see Orange Beanie's in the chat room too.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.780
Hi Beanie!

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.780
Hi Beanie, great job at chat yesterday.

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.780
And all of our chatters, our chat room's been picking up lately.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.780
Our cutesy girly girl.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.780
We got EOSFVB's a new person too, I think they came in last week and Vidpower started chatting here last week.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.780
And all of our regulars, we love them.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:47.780
I think during our next break we need to do our tribute to one of our famous people in our chat room, DJ Konami.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:16.780
You gotta start it off. It's your baby. It's your little crack-infested baby.

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.780
Crack-infested baby?

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.780
Never do a drug named after part of your own ass!

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.780
Wakalaka gives you wings, but...

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:36.780
It is that time of the show, ladies and gentlemen, where Jamie and the rest of us all get pissed off as hell, and we give our FUs of the week!

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.280
I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
Damn it!

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.780
Okay, fuck yous a week.

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:49.280
Um, first one is gonna go, and this wasn't anything anyone could control, so I'm saying fuck you to fate

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.780
for fucking with us in the fourth mix machine yesterday at Shaft.

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.780
Damn fate.

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.280
F you.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280
Damn you all to hell!

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280
Okay.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:03.780
Um, another one goes toward, um...

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.780
Um, you know, I really need some sleep.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.780
I guess there's just a blur.

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.780
Okay, okay. Fuck you to hoarding at the end of the day.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.780
And thank you to Vicodin.

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.780
Fuck you to sleeping for thirteen and a half hours.

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780
Sleep feels good though.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.780
Oh fuck yeah, but I will get something to eat.

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:26.780
Um, fuck you to, um, you know what?

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.780
I really am not filled with that in my checks today.

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.780
Are you really, Jamie, or are you an imposter?

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.780
I feel... good.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:44.780
That fucking sucks! Fuck you to my good mood, dammit, because I can't be eggsy enough to go off and out something enough to just be super pissed.

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.780
And I have to be super pissed to be ready to kill people too.

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.780
Okay, oh.

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.780
No, no, I can't. You don't need to.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.780
Fuck next.

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.780
Okay, so much for that.

01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:00.780
Sorry to hear that. Well, you know, after 19 weeks of being pissed off, it's time for Jamie to be in a loving sharing mood, right?

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.780
Fuck that, okay? That pisses me to hell. Okay.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:09.780
Alright, let's talk to Loki and see what his Fuck You of the Week is.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.780
Fuck You of the Week? Yeah, Fuck Yous of the Week. That's definitely for sure.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.780
First one goes to my cold. I don't like having a cold and it snuck up all the way up Friday and that really sucked.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.780
It's probably all the rain's fault, so F.U. to the rain, even though I like rain.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.780
F.U. for my battery being dead this morning in my car.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.780
At least it works now, I think, so that's cool.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:38.780
F.U. to Sagaru, because I hate that song, and they played it way too many times at the tournament yesterday.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.780
Also, a big, huge F.U. to something we're going to be covering in just a little bit.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.780
F.U. to Super Eurobeat, the new song that's going to be on GDR Extreme,

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.780
One of the most evil things on the face of the Earth.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:11:01.780
When you add Naoki with B4U with Politary, who was another person, you know that's going to be pure evil right there.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:05.780
So I'm very scared and concerned about that one.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.780
I show great concern for this new song.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.780
Um, also, let's see, what else do we got here?

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:20.780
FU to my, uh, pads for being faulty sometimes and me constantly having to repair them.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:31.780
FU for myself for getting shocked by my stereo numerous times while I was putting wires to it because I'm an idiot and I was tired and didn't unplug it when I was hooking up wires and just kept going,

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:34.780
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:41.780
Little Elder sounded vaguely pornographic.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:17.780
There's something I remember seeing yesterday that I was going to do an FU bout but I can't remember what it was.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.780
Damn it.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.780
Well, fuck that. We'll come back to you, Loki.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780
Yes!

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.780
In the meantime, my FU of the Week.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.780
We'll come back.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.380
My FU of the week goes to myself.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:40.620
Yesterday during the Orange Lounge live broadcast we were doing live from Shaft, we did some

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.860
music breaks so that Loki and whoever was on air could actually have a break to get

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.280
up and go out and do something.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.020
And one of the CDs that I used during the break was Dance Mania 20.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.980
So unfortunately yesterday I unknowingly played Bye Bye Baby Balloon on this station.

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:00.460
You bitch.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:05.780
So a big fuck you to me for breaking that rule that I put down weeks and weeks ago when

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.340
Bye Bye Baby Balloon was voted by the listless process as the worst Bomani song next to Let

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.340
Them Move.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.340
I played it yesterday.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.700
Not only did I play it, I played the full version.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.540
Wait, so this is gonna play dirty.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.020
I didn't play dirty yesterday, however I have in the past.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.020
I have a fuck you.

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.020
I have one.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.020
Yes. I have one.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.020
Okay, we have to go back to your music.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.020
Yes, of course.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:34.020
My fuck you goes toward that damn song for finally growing on me. Oh my god.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.020
I found myself at work with that song stuck in my head.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.020
What song, by the way?

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.020
Fucking dirty.

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.020
I'm pointing a finger at you.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.020
Stop swimming at me.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.020
Everybody yell at Rob.

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.020
Meanie.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.020
Did Loki- Oh, Loki, you thought of your FU?

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.020
Alright.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.020
Okay, this is a general FU.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.020
FU do speed mixes.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.020
They're the dumbest things in the face of the Earth.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.020
I hate everybody that does speed mixes of any sort.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.020
This goes with Jenny Rom and the Zippers.

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.020
I hate them all!

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:15.020
I hate them all!

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.020
JB is rocking here right now.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.020
I'm just gonna rock a lock on your ass.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:23.020
I don't care, okay. No, no, they've done some slower stuff, it's cool.

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.020
Amen, just wanted to make a-

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:28.020
But I hate- I hate bean mixes. I hate them to death, okay?

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:34.020
Now, okay, I'll give credit to, you know, Jenny Rahm and stuff, because some of her stuff is good, I do like it, you know?

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:40.020
But I dislike, for instance, we just heard the Venus, um, was it, uh, you can leave me alone?

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020
Yeah, we just heard it, like, an hour ago.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.020
Whatever, okay?

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.420
But so we heard it, it sounds like shit, okay?

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:50.520
That's just... just like, okay, I've heard one more time, that sounds like shit,

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.620
I've heard, like, I don't know, there's a bunch of stuff that I've heard, all of it sounds like crap!

01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.220
You just speed it up and have some guy cover it because you can't pay the artist royalty fees,

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.420
and it sounds like shit.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.420
And then the comedy goes,

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.020
Ooh! It's fast!

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.820
Let's put it in our next New York Stream super duper mix,

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.920
and then, you know, people play it and go,

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.520
Damn, this is tiring.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.120
I dislike it. I hate it.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120
And living in America sucks ass.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.120
Remember, CDR isn't just a power, it's a super duper power.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.120
Ugh, God.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.120
Ugh!

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.120
Stupid freakin'...

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120
Wow.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120
And F you to Nayoki because...

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120
I wanna say that.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.120
Well the chat room...

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.120
And F you to freakin' Nayoki Jirls because he's not putting anything good in there.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.120
And why is he speaking Japanese?

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.120
Why is he Japanese or something?

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.120
He can't speak English like everybody else in the face here.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.120
Why does this fuck you speak that?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.120
I was good in America after I sucked that one guy.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.120
To find out what this fuck is!

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120
I'm done!

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120
I'm finished.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120
The chat room is yelling at you, Loki.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120
They're half with you and half against you.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.120
Half of them are with you and half of them are against you.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Oh dear god.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Okay.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120
Are we ever going to get to the chat rooms?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.120
Fuck the chat rooms.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.120
I'm sorry, I love you guys, so forget that.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.120
First of all, speed mixes are okay.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.120
Some of them suck ass.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.120
Some of them suck ass. Major fuck yous go to Polteri for still being around.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:52.120
The woman, I've been listening to Polteri now, unfortunately, for days, because it keeps coming up.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:56.120
I say that we have a one week ban on Polteri from our radio show.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120
Oh, we're going to ban Polteri for the radio show?

01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120
Just for a week.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120
Just for a week?

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.120
There are some songs that have good music in them that are just really nice.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:10.120
Alright, fair enough. Starting tomorrow, Orange Lounge has banned Politary from its playlist completely.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:19.120
Um, I have another proposition. I am offering a $500 bounty for Politary. Dead.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.120
No, no, you can't kill her! This killing is wrong!

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.120
Alright, how about this?

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120
$500 for her to go mute.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.120
Shove, like, acid down her throat?

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120
Shove a Twinkie down her throat.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.120
A dry Twinkie!

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.120
$500 for a super hot fried Twinkie, shoved down volunteer's throat.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.120
To dissolve her larynx, and she can't sing anymore.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.120
I want her tongue sent to me in a plastic baggie through the mail.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:50.120
Make sure that you vacuum seal it so that it stays fresh so we can see it still twitch.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.120
Oh my God! We've had sex, we've had violence.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.120
We've had sex in the first hour of the show, we have violence right now.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.960

Also, I'm going to have to say that, um, oh, shoot, what else was one of my, uh, FUs?

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:44.560
Oh, FU to Scandia for having their party room window covered up by blue paint or something because I couldn't see the friggin' machine.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.560
But Scandia rules, so we'll forgive him this one time.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.560
Ah, yes, Orange Lounge Vice City tonight. That's what we're being called.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:59.560
You know, oh, F you to Vice City, because I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.560
She gets in my car, she takes money, and she goes, you know what, that's your sound clip from now on.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:09.560
For the life of me, I can't get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.560
This is now chat room fuck you time, so Rob, go at it.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.560
Oh yes, okay.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Oh, I had special music for them, that's okay.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:29.560
I like KOGD3. They kick ass, instead of Red Monster Hyper.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:59.560
I have to beta-test SDK Max 5.0 in the next 2-3 days, finish my special art project by Wednesday, or get an F on it, and make an Avid site out of my ass before December 7th.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:07.560
And F you to Loki, tell him to get him on fuckin' AIM because I'm home all effing gay.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:14.560
Dave, I have to give Dave special music. I don't remember what Dave's FU song was, though. Does anybody remember Dave's FU song?

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.560
I'm just gonna play this song for Dave, he'll like it.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:51.560
I'm reading without thinking. Sorry. I hope she's not listening with her speakers turned up, but somebody's in trouble.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560
My bad, sorry guys.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.560
Back to the arrested chat room.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.560
God, he's got too many. I'm only doing part of these.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.560
F you for not understanding a single word of the Shaft stuff tonight. F every female on this planet.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.560

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.560
and celebrate

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.020
at the entire cbsd dr coverage which we've got to talk about for the shows

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.020
over

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.200
at those stupid dancers who won the s two and pads on that

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:28.640
and f low-key because he asked for

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.160
twenty-third maggots uh... f roulette he expects something on race style when he

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.920
does improv freestyle or something like sugaru for improv

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.200
that's really

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.200
Instead, as we all know, he got Nori Nori Nori. Kill!

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.200
I still should get an award for most incongruous routine. Fuck you, Nori Nori Nori.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.200
DJ Konami

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.200
F you to Kakumei Encore Stage because I failed on the sixth step.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.200
SoCal Kicks, I missed a part and I closed the window. I'm sorry, resend it to me. I'll read it.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.200
JB says

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.200
F you to anyone who doesn't like Hello Panda cookies. They should be stabbed with sporks.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.200
F you to hurting after the turning and burning myself in the deep fryer.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200
I like how he has a cookie.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.200
And I say Polteri can sing and Naoki can't compose.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.200
I'd like to add that JB, you know, kind of that was your fault

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.200
since you're deep frying everything that you could get your hands on.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:27.200
I mean, that was pretty entertaining watching him deep fry pretty much everything.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:30.200
And I think one of the most popular things that was being deep fried yesterday

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.200
other than Twinkies had to be the candy corn.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200
Deep fried candy corn.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.200
By the way, you're very welcome. I hope you enjoyed your Hello Kitty Yan Yan.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:09.440
the girls gone wild there should be a guys gone wild series

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.440
g-o-s-s-b-b says wow

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:19.440
fuck you

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.680

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.320
so he says china power so we'll leave it at that

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.520
vidpower says my nephew of the week goes to the official animal crossing site

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:37.520
because they've taken down the Donkey Kong Jr. Nest game and it's now replaced with Clu Clu Land D.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.520
I think we have the codes for that if you need it.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.520
Now I can't get Donkey Kong Jr. in my town now.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.520
Also, F you to wrapping paper because I like to keep my DVD covers in excellent condition

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.520
and the wrapping paper took about 45 minutes to get off because of all the extra tape they put on it.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.520
I have another fuck you.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.520
You've hit your quota for tonight.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.520
Uh, I'm the angsty happy bunny.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:05.520
My fuck you of the week goes to my fiancé Dan for hitting Mallory in the head with the bug net.

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.520
Mallory is a bitch and she needs to die.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520
She needs to burn in Animal Crossing hell.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520
I do not want Mallory to-

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.520
Go to Animal Crossing hell and burn Mallory. I hate you.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.520
And also to our town lesbian Dina.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:22.520
Because she went ahead and took care of her errand myself just because it was a day late.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:35.520
And, and, and, and fuck you to, um, well, you know what, I need people to play Phantasy Star with, so if anyone else Phantasy Star Online in a broadband thingy for the GameCube, let me know, or if not, then fuck you.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.520
I don't wanna play with you.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.520
SoCalKick says F you to whoever hates on Loki.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520
He doesn't get my music.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.520
I'm sorry, you're right, he doesn't get your music.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.520
Give him Miracle Moon.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
He gets something even better.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.940
1... 2... 3... 4...

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:52.320
F you to whoever hates on Loki because that was the best rant-a-thon I've heard in ages.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:54.260
Awwww!

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:59.120
23rd Magus, uh, Pauletari sounds like Yoko Ono with Laryngitis.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.260
Co-co-co-co-co...

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.480
Gwen says F you to me because I wasn't supposed to say that female one on the air.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.740
My bad!

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:11.360
EOSFBB says F you to me for being quote unquote racism.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.120
Sorry, you just kind of used some kind of words. I don't want to stay on the air. It's kind of bad

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.720
And DDR and it's on a happy note. Thanks for the kudos Rob and Jamie

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.320
Yes, whoever took my signed tape

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.260
And I have to watch my bootleg DVD which has really bad stuff

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840
F that

this is dedicated to all DJ Konami fans of the world, here you go, enjoy

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:22.480
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.480
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.200
Listen carefully and try to follow

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.480
The object will come down from the top

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:38.480
When it hits the red line, push the button.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.480
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480
You get it?

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.480
Alright, let's practice.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:57.480
First, hit the white keys.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.480
Now, hit the black key!

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480
Yeah.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.480
Yeah.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480
Yeah.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:14.480
Okay, now a combination of both white and black key!

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.480
Easy, huh?

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.480
Alright, let's go on to the Scratch game.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.480
Can the object reach the red line?

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480
Scratch!

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.480
With the fast note, the technique is to Scratch fast.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.480
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.480
It's hard, but you can do it!

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.480
Okay, effector time!

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.480
And here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.480
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.480
That's the effect on an on switch.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.480
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.480
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.480
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.480
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:53.480
This powerful sound system's whooping, everybody!

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.480
Ha!

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.480
All right, gotta go!

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.480
Knock me out with your fabulous sounds

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.480
Some very little version of good speed man, yeah

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.480

Everybody wants a piece of the pie

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.860
Bolsa mila means the eye

01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.660
Coso los a la gravity I know the fight

This is the way we dance

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.360
This is the way we rock

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.760
This is the way we fight

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.060
As we demonstrate

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.060
As we demonstrate

Everybody wants a piece of the pie

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.540
Pull the meat, I miss the eye

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:24.900
Push the moves when I cover the eye

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.500
Throw the fight cause I spy

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.500
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.500
This is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.500
As we demonstrate, everybody wants a piece of the pie

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500
Who's a reader, mister I

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Who's a loser, like nobody I know the fight

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.500
Cause I smile, this is the way we dance

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:46.500
It's just the way we rock and it's just the way we ride

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
Tonight

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.500
I'll try to let you remember

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:16.500
All the time, that we were having together

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:23.500
Sing a song, you and me can be singing

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:28.500
Tonight, such a pleasure, come on

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.500
And let yourself go

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:45.500
Flotation, feel the flow It's time to let yourself go

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:59.500
Flotation, feel the flow Come on, live your life

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.500
You don't get second chances

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.500
Love the night

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:11.500
Release the seven senses

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.500
Feel the flow

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.500
It's time to let yourself go

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.500
Tonight

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.500
Such a pleasure

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.500
Come on!

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:27.500
Just let yourself go

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:34.500
Feel the flow, it's time to let yourself go

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:42.500
Lose control, let yourself go

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:48.500
It's time to let yourself go

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Feel the flow flow, and let yourself go

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Lotation

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:18.500
Just let yourself go, let yourself go

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Let yourself go, feel the flow now

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
Oh...

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.500
Oh...

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
Incorporate yourself, Oh...

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
Oh...

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:36.500
Pop this out

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:40.500
Feel the flow inside to let yourself go

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500
Feel it fall down

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500
Lose control, control

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.500
Let yourself go

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.500
Oh...

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500
Foundation

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Let the, let yourself go

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500
Flotation

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:00.500
Feel the flow now, oh now

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.500
Flotation

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500
Feel the flow

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500
It's time to let yourself go

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.500
Flotation

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.500
Lose control

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:30.940
What?

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.780
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:37.200
If you don't know Wesley Willis, maybe you should.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.260
That's where that little promo comes from.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:46.760
It was a joke, and I don't even think it was really something I ever intended on putting into the station rotation, but we need a new promos. What can I say?

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.260
We'll make more, then.

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.260
We'll make more.

01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:56.260
Yeah, sometime this...now that the tournament's over, we can, sometime this week, get you guys over, we'll work on more promos. That'll be fun.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:03.260
Oh, they're asking about the Bubble Bobble techno song that we played one night. Do you remember what that was, Jamie?

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.260
That was last week. It should be on...it's on this disc.

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:10.260
We don't have to play it right now because we probably don't have enough time because we've got enough stuff that we want to talk about.

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:15.260
Maybe we'll get to it in the after birth, but do you remember what that was called and where you got it?

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.260
It was one of the Overclocked remixes.

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:19.260
So probably Overclocked.org?

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.260
Yep, should be Overclocked.org, look under B.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.260
Search for Bubble Bubble and you'll probably find it.

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:28.260
All I've got to say is, you know, I've been, you know, especially nowadays, you know,

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:35.260
I'm totally browsing the internet while I'm working, because I like to exploit their T1 line there.

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:42.260
I've been checking out a lot of these Overclock remixes, and there's this one artist in particular,

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:48.260
I believe his name is DJ Final Fantasy, or DJ Fantasy or something like that.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.260
And he's actually done some stuff for Final Fantasy VII.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:57.260
He did this one that's called Strings Machine, that's just an awesome trance.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:01.260
I mean, this guy should be doing professional stuff, I mean, I don't know why he's not.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:11.260
Yes, the ones to check out are definitely Strings Machine, then there's also one that's a Geneva Trance remix, that's really cool, there's a few other ones.

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:18.260
Metalroid is another good one to check out, it's a Metroid themed remix, it's kind of hard rock, which is pretty cool.

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:19.260
What's that URL one more time?

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:23.260
It's, I believe it's remix.overclock.org.

01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:27.260
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay, that's cool, remix.overclock. Good stuff.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.260
If you just do a web search for overclock, you'll find it.

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:34.460
Well you might want to do Overclock Remix otherwise you're going to get a bunch of sites.

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.460
Don't clack me.

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:39.680
Alright, let's talk about, we've got about 20 minutes left in the show, we've got a bunch

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.860
of Imani news to cram in, but speaking of time left in the show, this is an announcement

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.900
we haven't made yet during the show, we probably should have opened the show saying it, but

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:55.620
starting next week with episode 20, Orange Lounge season number 2 debuts a whole new

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.620
season.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:01.560
I'm concerned the past 21 shows or however many we did because we had a couple have shows in there

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.880
They've all been leading up to next week. Yes, it's all been practice

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.380
Because next week we're taking orange lounge to three hours a three hour tour

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.200
Save a three hour tour

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:22.240
We're gonna start the show at 630 Pacific Standard Time half hour earlier. We're gonna run it a half hour later to 930 and

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.440
Loki

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.880
officially on board as the third co-host since he's been the past couple weeks

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.480
and uh... we gotta rework a new intro because we'll have to get Loki in there and

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.600
all sorts of stuff. It's gonna be a whole new season. Now we got a new website to match.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.160
So we're getting a facelift. We're getting a facelift.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.720
Maybe we should be here when

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.240
Rob makes the intro or maybe

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.440
someone should hook me up with a particular program that we need to let somebody else make an intro.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.880
I can hear it now.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.480
Loki! For the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me!

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.080
Thank you for giving that to me once again, nice and clear. That'll make editing a lot easier, thank you.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:03.980
Um, so that's how it's gonna go. It's gonna go 6.30 to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:10.580
The replays will still be 7 o'clock on Monday and 2 o'clock on Thursday for the time being.

01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.380
As long as I get to be an angsty, happy bunny.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.980
Of course, as always.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.680
Happy. Or angsty, or both.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.520
that's uh...

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.040
pretty much all you need to know new season starts next week now you know and

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.680
knowing is half the battle

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.680
okay

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.160
but money news this week way back to monday day after we did this show cbs

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.840
on the early show i was asleep did

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.560
uh... a little ddr promotion on it

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.880
is basically one gigantic infomercial for ddr where everybody did not know

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.160
shit

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:49.760
that would be the best way to describe it. It was like taking the audience members from

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.760
an infomercial and having them do the infomercial. Here's what they did. They got this local

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.480
dance school to come down there, and they had these people that I guess were from some

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.440
dance school from what it looked like, a local school and everything, and they were playing

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.680
DDR. The dance school of Jennifer Lopez. Okay, it was pretty bad. I mean, no one really knew

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:12.200
what they were doing, watching like newbie people playing DDR USA. They had three machines

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.480
there and then all speaking of the machine setup

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.120
this pissed me off I don't know why I get angry about it but I just find it

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.200
kinda irritating

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.520
they had max two machines with USA banners on them

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.600
that's I'd

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.680
that really strikes a bad chord with me it's kinda like

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:39.000
Konami why why you have to lie why don't you just give us a new mix

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.560
Oh, that's interesting.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.560
Did you not notice that?

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560
I did not notice that.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.960
There was freeze arrows they were playing, and one of the songs being played was Japan.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960
They had Max II...

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960
Matsuri, Japan.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.880
Sorry, Matsuri, Japan.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.480
One of the machines, the one in the middle was a USA machine, the one that the CBS host

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.620
played on that was a USA machine, however the two side machines were Max II machines.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:04.900
And it's kind of like, you kind of feel like, you know, obviously for Joe, Q, Public, those

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.860
Those that don't know DDR very well, you know, it doesn't matter, it's not a big deal.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:15.300
But you're kind of like, why are you misrepresenting the product here?

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.900
I mean, now the home version of Max is similar to Max 2, it's got a lot of the cool things

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:20.900
Max 2 does.

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.140
Why didn't we just have somebody demo the home version of Max?

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:29.300
Why did we have to invent these arcade machines that don't exist in the US?

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.860
I don't know.

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:35.520
It doesn't sit well with me, and I think Konami deserves a big slap on the wrist for that.

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.180
Well, one of the highlights I thought that was pretty interesting...

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.340
Or whoever made that decision, maybe Konami didn't make that decision.

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:46.060
You gotta love that they had a video game expert there who was talking about DDR and

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.420
had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.

01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:55.260
All I could think of during that whole thing was, that guy's really gay.

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:56.420
He's really, really gay.

01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.620
He's saying gay things.

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.940
He's kinda talking gay.

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:02.620
This whole segment is kind of gay.

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:08.380
I don't know, I didn't see this, and I'm sounding vaguely glad that I didn't.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.820
I was asleep.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:15.940
I'm being reminded that one reason they probably did the marquee switch was because the imports

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:16.940
are illegal.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:17.940
Okay?

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:18.940
True that.

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:24.020
But that doesn't get around the issue of you used an import machine, you just lied about

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.020
it.

01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:26.020
Exactly.

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.860
it's like, you know, okay, so they had trouble importing USA machines.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:34.620
Fine. Why didn't we promo Max USA? It's a damn good product.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.100
That's what we should have been demoing. You know, if they had, you know, maybe

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.700
out of PlayStation, a couple ignition pads, could have hoard out Red Octane,

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:46.780
or the official Konami pads if Konami wasn't over off their own product.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:50.980
Well, what they ended up doing is they had a drawing throughout the show, which anyone watching a show

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.580
really didn't give a rat's ass.

01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.580
It was only for the people actually at the show.

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.580
Yeah, I know. Super contest, which has been pre-taped.

01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:07.580
It was two pretty shitty-ass third-party dance performance pads and a, what was it, PlayStation 2 and a DDR Max USA game.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.580
Which is pretty, I mean, obviously that's pretty cool, you know, I'd love to win that if I was there.

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:15.580
The thing is, they didn't really plug the game that much.

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.580
I mean, they talked about, you know...

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.580
No. No, they kind of didn't. They were just kind of like,

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:25.220
Well, it's this new game that's sweeping the nation, and we're going to let these ignoramus

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:29.100
dent students play it, and we're going to give one of them a fabulous prize of a home

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.780
version game that we're going to just kind of show you, the box art of.

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.940
What's funny is Konami is kind of trying to forget about DDR USA.

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:38.940
You think?

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.940
Yes.

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:43.700
Notice, on the show, they only mention DDR Max and Konami.

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.260
There's no mention of DDR USA.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.300
Oh, the first PlayStation version?

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:48.580
No one wants to remember that.

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:52.540
comparison economics USA mix is inferior I mean it's just like you wouldn't talk

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:58.100
about first mix in Japan anymore I mean DDR USA was kind of our first mix I

01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.980
guess yeah but I mean that's a whole nother debate that we've had too many

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:09.900
times on the show and also it might not have been Konami's fault that whole

01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:13.600
switcheroo might not have been Konami's fault it may have been CBS that made

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.420
that decision but F whoever did that because that wasn't cool

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.940
Whoever's decision it was f them. Yeah, I saw some pictures from it

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.360
And honestly if you're going to show off something

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:29.780
It's like having a product if you're gonna show a product you put it in the most positive light possible

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.780
And you don't do it by putting

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:36.140
People who have no idea what they're doing there. It's like basically

01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.660
Being told how

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.340
Being instructed in the cop in the Kama Sutra by a priest

01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:48.780
It's the same difference.

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:54.060
They have no idea how to do any of that, unless they've been reading confiscated material.

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.060
I don't know about some of them, but you know.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.060
No, I agree.

01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:00.020
I don't understand why they didn't interview the dance expert.

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:02.460
They had all these DDR people in.

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:06.460
They flew 8-Ball out there, or he flew out there, I don't know what the hell the arrangement

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:11.260
was there, but he was just kind of there in the background, wearing a DDR Freak t-shirt.

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.260
I thought I...

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.260
What was that?

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.160
Didn't he make a comment during one of the clips?

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.260
I'm not sure, because I didn't exactly...

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.500
I don't know what 8-Ball looks like, to be honest.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.160
And I thought there was some guy that looked like he knew he was talking about, and...

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.860
He was the only guy wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.020
That might have been him, then.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.020
I don't know.

01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.020
I can't remember.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.020
If I remember correctly.

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.020
It was...

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.020
I don't know, either.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.580
But yeah, they should have...

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:37.180
The dance school's kids should not have been there, and whoever that guy was wasn't kamami.

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:38.180
He shouldn't have been there, either.

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.820
Let me just put it this way, though.

01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:42.260
Any publicity is good publicity.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:45.300
That's very true, and you know, it's going to sell the game a little more.

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:48.500
Maybe we will get an arcade machine in the US that's like Max 2, but...

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:52.620
You know, we had the discussion about it, you know, it was me and I don't remember who

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.860
I was talking to about it, but we were making the discussion that now that the whole Endo

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:04.220
Mirror suit's been settled, or is in process of settling, it opens the door for a new mix,

01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:11.100
And I don't think that necessarily that Konami themselves have to do the work on it.

01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:15.300
I mean if they're allowing third parties to do the arcade releases, they could just easily

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.060
have a team set aside.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:22.740
I know, it's just kind of like, you just kind of want to know, you know, if you, if we were

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.260
just in the know a little more, if we knew a little bit more about how that, all that

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:30.860
operation works, you know, what goes on inside Konami's roof, inside Konami's Japan roof,

01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:34.620
inside of Comedy of America's Roof, it would probably make a lot more sense to us, and

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.980
we wouldn't be so bitter about this game that we've wasted so much money on.

01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.700
The fact is we don't.

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.480
And so we're just confused, and we don't get it.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.300
But luckily at least the home releases are moving in the right direction by far.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:52.100
So if they do end up doing a Max 2 in the U.S., which I don't see why they wouldn't,

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.540
it'll probably kick a lot of ass.

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:58.500
All right, CBS, yes.

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:02.500
So, I guess we can talk about other smaller stuff that went on.

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.500
Any other news you know?

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Well, we've got, of course, the eighth release of characters for DDRPC.

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.500
Not that anyone ever plays that game anymore.

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.500
I'm sure there are certain people that play that game, but I know for me...

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.500
I did see this morning.

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.500
I did not play this. I don't play this game anymore.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500
It crashes on my computer and whatever.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
The newest character to be released?

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
The newest characters that we have.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:29.220
I got two Latin people, I don't remember what their names are, it doesn't really matter.

01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.580
But the most important one is Jason Enos.

01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.580
Yes, Jason Enos is a playable character in DDR.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:39.820
Which we all pretty much knew about ever since the game came out that he would be released

01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:40.820
at some point.

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.820
That's really cool, but his head is small.

01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:42.820
That's exactly what I said.

01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.760
His head is smaller than the rest of his body.

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:48.120
Some graphic artist really fucked up on that.

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.540
And his shirt looks like your shoes.

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:50.540
That was cool.

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:51.540
Dude, I love the shirt.

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:52.540
I want that.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.700
The shirt was awesome, but he has a shrunken head.

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:55.700
That's a real bummer.

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:56.700
But it's still pretty neat.

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.700
But I don't know.

01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.700
We didn't play it in-game.

01:46:58.700 --> 01:46:59.700
I haven't played it in-game yet.

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.700
So he probably looks okay there.

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:01.700
But that little preview picture of him.

01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:02.700
Whoops.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.820
It's still really cool.

01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:08.500
You know that you've made it when you are in DDR.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:13.420
DJ Konami is hoping that they release Kyle Snyder as a hidden character at some point.

01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:15.380
Probably not going to happen.

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:17.300
And the Sky character, yes.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.300
And the Dark Sakura.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.420
Sky and Dark Sakura should be a team that comes up.

01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:22.420
No.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.060
But we'd have to have orange bats.

01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:27.060
Okay, if they gave us orange bats, would you be a DDR PC character?

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.060
Okay, I would.

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:32.220
But, you know, someone let us know if you can, you know, make skins for the characters

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.220
or something.

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:35.180
Let us know if anyone's figured out how to hack it.

01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.820
And then Loki can be in DDR PC, too, and he'll kind of have that big trench coat of his on

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:44.060
doing that whole Keanu Reeves thing, whoa, I know DDR.

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:47.060
Whoa, I forgot my steps.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:51.420
A little inside there.

01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:58.420
Other than that, some stuff is probably going to be announced, I'm not positive it's going to be announced next week, but that's when it's scheduled to be announced.

01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:02.420
Turning Mix 3! Yes, Turning Mix 3 is coming up.

01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.420
Oh, this would be the SimNews portion.

01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:10.420
Yes, SimNews, I guess. Turning Mix 3 is going to be started, so we're going to see a lot more Sim files, hooray!

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:21.420
And, you know, this time around I'm expecting BemaniRuler not to enter, you know, unless, of course, you know, almost all of his files are out there except for one, and that's the return.

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:25.420
And so, well, if he is gonna enter, it'll probably be that one.

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:35.420
Which is a, you know, sounds like a cool file, but really, I think we're all sick of BemaniRuler. In fact, I believe part of yesterday's ranting on the radio was me ripping on BemaniRuler.

01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:43.420
Which, I don't give a shit because he's a punk as far as I'm concerned, but that's just my opinion.

01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:45.420
Loki gets on his soapbox!

01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:47.420
Yeah, okay, off my soapbox here.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:56.420
So, Turning Mix 3, they're talking about actually having prizes. There was going to be some DVDs provided by myself, but they never took me up on that and now it's too late.

01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:00.420
So, oh well, screw that, they're going to have to buy their own prizes.

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:07.420
So there's probably going to be prices this time around. There might be a section where you actually have to pay to enter, so that's kind of crap, but whatever.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:14.420
This time, this time, unlike the last two times that I said I was going to enter, this time I will enter because I'm actually making sim files now.

01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:19.420
So you'll see something from me in there if it's not, you know, something that I've already made.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.420
So we'll see something from me in the tournament this time.

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:29.420
I guess I can plug my site a little bit, you know, of course everyone knows about www.leechfromloki.tk

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:35.420
I'm going to be uploading, probably tonight, my finished copy of Outer Limits.

01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:38.420
I finished that, no, actually yesterday.

01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:39.420
Yay!

01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:41.420
How did you have any time to finish that yesterday?

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:45.420
Well, technically yesterday, if you consider like 1 a.m. yesterday.

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.420
Oh, okay.

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:51.420
And so, I finished that yesterday, so it's almost, it's all ready to go.

01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:52.420
I just need to upload it.

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.420
It's kind of fun.

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.420
Pretty difficult.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:50:00.420
I tried playing it on the pad today and I just realized I can't do 10-footers on a pad, so yay.

01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:03.420
Other than that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs.

01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:09.420
They've got another user sim file section updated to where people can submit files now

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.420
and you'll see a bunch of cool stuff come on there.

01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:17.420
Also, DDR UK, if you're not a member of that site, I recommend becoming one

01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:21.420
Who also you might know from his Bantu originals and that kind of thing.

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:25.420
He actually is doing synced sets for DDR.

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:32.420
He's got synced sets for EuroMix and EuroMix 2 full sets with MP3s and everything that you can download when you zip or by themselves.

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:37.420
And also he has Disney's rave done and he's working on Club Mix and he's going to do the rest.

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:44.420
And actually if you find his site, which I can't remember the URL by itself, he's got synced sets for Max 2 and DDR Max.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:57.420
He's got sync sets for Max 2 and DDR Max, and I think he had at one point all the other original one through fifth, but I have them, but they're not on the site anymore.

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:01.420
So you'll have to find them somewhere else. But they're out there, so just keep looking.

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:07.420
Other than that, I don't think there's any more updates with StepMania. I haven't heard anything.

01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.420
The final just got released.

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.420
Some tumbleweed rolled by.

01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:17.420
The final got released a couple of weeks ago, so not too much going on there.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.420
Really, that's pretty much it.

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:29.420
I know there's a few people still trying to find out a way to crack the DDR Max 2 edit machine code thing there.

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:34.420
Something I've been working on for months and kind of giving up on because I don't play the arcade machines anymore.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:43.420
Maybe we'll crack that, and then I'll go play again and make some more edits, and I'm supposed to make some edits to be on SoCalKick's site, so look for those.

01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:48.420
That's pretty much it. Not too much going on this week. It's kind of dry. Hopefully we'll see you a little bit more this week.

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:54.420
And always check in on Tuesday night to find out what Naoki's journal is going to be. Oh! That's right.

01:51:54.420 --> 01:52:03.420
One other thing, not Simphile related, but DDR Extreme News. We did find out that there is another song announced. It's going to be...

01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:10.420
Love is the Power, which is the ending theme from DDR Second Mix, so that's going to be in there, another Naoki track.

01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:24.420
Also, as I mentioned earlier, in my FUs of the Week, Super Eurobeat, which is going to be done by Naoki, featuring the DDR All-Stars, which is Polteri, B4U, and some other chick, I can't remember the name.

01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:30.420
And so, yeah, you'll have to listen for that one, I'm sure it's going to sound like a train wreck.

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:46.420
Also, a few more Oni courses, there's a really particular evil one that's got a bunch of slow songs like Bag and Orion78 played at half speed, so it's going to look like one giant mass of arrows coming up the screen that you can't read, so that'll be fun, I guess.

01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:56.420
Check Aaron in Japan's site, he's got a really cool comprehensive list on there, and his stuff's pretty updated really frequently, so go check that out.

01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.420
And that's pretty much it.

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:04.060
Alright, well, we've got a few more minutes left in the show, and I thought what I'd do

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:06.300
is open up the mailbag.

01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:12.640
We're going to open up the email mailbag right now on the station, so let's get some mailbag

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.640
and music, shall we?

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.640
Let's do it.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.640
I'll do it.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.060
Let me go ahead and make a mention of something while you're filling that out.

01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:19.060
Yes, please do.

01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.660
I'm working on a little something now that I have some spare time again.

01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.820
This tournament's over, thank God.

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:31.980
Basically, go ahead and send in an email to OrangeChallengeRadio.com with what your favorite

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:33.420
joke of the show is.

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:43.940
That would be whether it's a Nalky's Diary, maybe, or maybe our hatred of Politary, or

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:47.760
your favorite segment, or maybe even our listless segment.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:52.620
What is your favorite staple discussion of our show?

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:59.620
go ahead and send that and just put attention DS for the subject and you may see something

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.620
come of that over the next few weeks.

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:08.220
Alright cool. The email address is orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com and we're going

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.220
to go check the mailbag right now.

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:17.220
Go into the mailbag. Go into the mailbag. Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.

01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:20.220
Yes, we're opening up the mailbag right now.

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.220
Ah, I see this entire week we've gotten one new email.

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:27.220
Hey, that's one more than we got last week.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:29.220
Yes, and a lengthy one it is, too.

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.220
Yes, this is a great email.

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:35.220
This comes to us from somebody who refers to themselves as

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:41.220
Mask-kun of Suspenseful on behalf of the entire Closet Poppers Society.

01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.220
Now when I first read this, I thought,

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:46.220
Closet Poppers, that sounds kind of like a rave thing.

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.220
Read the letter.

01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:49.220
Let's read the letter.

01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:54.220
Good evening, I'm speaking for all of the members of the Closet Poppers Society, affectionately

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.220
known in our inner circles as Judy's Basement.

01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:00.220
And we as a whole listen to your radio station almost religiously.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:01.220
Well thank you.

01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.220
We love you.

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:06.780
In fact, number 349, Sanchez, quartet of the mariachi, is such a fan that he maintains

01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:11.140
a small shrine to both of you, which is all, there is three of us now, thank you, which

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:17.340
is located between the paint cams at his hardware store, which he is not at one of our meetings.

01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:24.340
Your 24-hour Bahmani words of wisdom inspire us all. I love people that can kiss some ass.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:30.020
We try our best to play every game that they make. Unfortunately, we feel that there may

01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:34.660
be major bias within those divine offices, and it is starting to get on the coalition's

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:39.500
nerves just a tiny bit. What are we talking about? Basically, we've chalked up numerous

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:45.060
hours of listen time, many thanks to Danny of Surf Punk and Yamye of Asian Ska, who took

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:50.160
the time to set up the player, and on most occasions felt that each of the great Konami's

01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:54.100
honorable franchises has been fairly represented in regards to each other. If the collection

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:58.740
of 2DX music began to eclipse that of Guitar Freaks or Keyboard Mania, the system would

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.580
quickly be brought back into relative balance.

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:06.260
Actually, I think we have more 2DX music than any of those, but I'm pretty sure we do, but

01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.260
I don't know if...

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:09.260
But we do have a good selection of the others.

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:26.260
Fair enough. We do have a good selection of most Bamani music. However, our society is mainly composed of pop and music 1 through 8 fans, and out of the many times we have tuned in, we have only heard maybe 2 or 3 songs out of the well over 350 that exist, and we feel that you're not doing the license any justice.

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:28.260
If I can find pop and music songs...

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.260
You know, I think I know a place where I can find some.

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:36.260
I will make it my mission to download plenty of pop and music stuff for you guys.

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:41.220
Alright, Jean-Marc of Arty Pop has been especially traumatized by the imbalance and keeps running

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:45.180
into walls, rambling about buttons that never were.

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.800
To make a long story short, we've come to beg you to add more pop and music tracks to

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:49.900
the lineup.

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:54.480
All we ask is maybe two to three a month until the series catches up to its brethren and

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.880
its long-lived potential.

01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:00.400
We repeat, give the poppers the reparization they deserve.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.740
You asked for it, you got it.

01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:02.940
You asked for it, you got it.

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:04.100
We've got the space for it, we can accommodate it.

01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:09.100
This week on Orange Lounge, Politary is out, Poppin' Music is in.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:13.100
But my personal request, we need Poppin' Music and the Melo stuff.

01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.100
I have to have the Cutie Honey theme on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:20.100
We will make it our mission to go find ourselves some Poppin' Music.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:27.100
Of course, here on Orange Lounge, we always go out and buy the legit soundtracks before we put songs into rotation.

01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:35.100
Of course! So, we're going to go right now and order soundtracks!

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.100
We will order them!

01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:44.100
And as soon as those ordered soundtracks are in our possession, we will replay them and play them for you.

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:49.100
In fact, I will have mine rushed overnight so that they get here on time for this week.

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:54.100
We will have them rushed overnight! Yes, we shall do that! That's a fabulous idea.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:58.100
We will make sure that they are sent by a special electronic courier.

01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:03.100
Yes. Yes, electronic courier. I like that idea.

01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:06.100
Alright.

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:10.100
Okay, I'll repeat my comment. End the show. I have to go to the bathroom.

01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:15.100
Okay, we're going to end the show, but I need to queue up the music real fast.

01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:18.100
So, is this tonight's fortune cookie right there? Yes it is.

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:23.100
Okay, so I need to ask really fast though if you guys have any final thoughts.

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:45.100
1 Must Fall Battlegrounds

01:58:53.100 --> 01:59:17.100
I want to hear the fortune cookie.

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:21.660
They want to know the mailbag music. The mailbag music is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:29.540
Mania 2nd Mix. And Baquah is not on any DDR soundtracks. It's from the artist's CD, Lee

01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:35.900
Jung Hyun. And I'm too honky to pronounce that correctly. Good night!

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:42.940
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:56.980
of the day.

01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:02.980
Prepare for trouble!

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:06.060
And make it double-double!

02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:10.060
Quit imitating us!

02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:16.260

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:23.740
