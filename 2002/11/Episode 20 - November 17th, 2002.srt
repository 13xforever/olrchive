1
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:03,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:04,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:08,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:16,049
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:22,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:26,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:29,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:32,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:34,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode... Hey, are there any boys down there?

12
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.

13
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,895
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite scary?

14
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,145
[SPEAKER_11]: What's yours?

17
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:55,646
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:56,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:58,648
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

21
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:03,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,031
[SPEAKER_11]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:06,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

26
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:15,277
[SPEAKER_04]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

27
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:16,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Kendo.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,221
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

29
00:01:38,277 --> 00:01:42,661
[SPEAKER_16]: We are live and this is episode number 20 for November the 17th of 2002.

30
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,843
[SPEAKER_17]: But not November 20th.

31
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:48,666
[SPEAKER_16]: It is our second season premiere.

32
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:50,408
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was most rejoicing.

33
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:51,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

34
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,170
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like fall sweeps.

35
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It's sweeps week.

36
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:58,675
[SPEAKER_16]: In this episode, Jamie's going to get married.

37
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:00,516
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

38
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:01,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you.

39
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,738
[SPEAKER_16]: And Loki's going to have a baby.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,280
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

41
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,340
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

42
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:13,746
[SPEAKER_16]: You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's most premier radio station of all things Bimani.

43
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,608
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

44
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

45
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,033
[SPEAKER_16]: You know who better as DarkSakura.

46
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello to our newest co-host.

47
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, not really because he's been here since the beginning.

48
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,218
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our TechMassaLoki.

49
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, everybody.

50
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,695
[SPEAKER_16]: and we have some special guests in studio tonight.

51
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:45,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello first off to a chat room frequenter, our chat cookie that has finally crossed to the other side of the monitor and he's here in the studio tonight.

52
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello to Black Lab, everybody.

53
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, everybody.

54
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:49,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Now fear me!

55
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:55,163
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, as always, because we just can't get rid of him, it's Dave.

56
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

57
00:02:58,584 --> 00:02:59,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

58
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Love, I just gotta have it, I believe

59
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:49,546
and...

60
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:28,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

61
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,661
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

62
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:36,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we are.

63
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,835
[SPEAKER_16]: We, a little bit earlier than usual.

64
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:43,178
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's the new game here, 6.30 to 9.30.

65
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we're so bored and have nothing to do.

66
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we thought we'd share our boredom with the rest of you.

67
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:50,866
[SPEAKER_16]: But I see that a lot of people caught on to it.

68
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,528
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got a good amount of people on board right now.

69
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Now Black Lab will burp the nations of the world.

70
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Black Lab's going to do some burping for us?

71
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:57,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

72
00:08:58,614 --> 00:08:59,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no.

73
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:08,012
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying... The chat room... Oh, by the way, if you do want to join the chat room, it's super easy now because we have a brand new website.

74
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Big thank you to SoCalKicks for helping out with that.

75
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,294
[SPEAKER_17]: We are of you.

76
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a new chat thing on the website.

77
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,598
[SPEAKER_16]: So just go to orangelounge.skie.cx Is it Java or Yava?

78
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:20,778
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Yava.

79
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Yava.

80
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And Twen helped me out to figure out how we get a Java thing going.

81
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you to Twen, too.

82
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:26,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

83
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:26,961
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm not going to kiss Twen.

84
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:28,002
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

85
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:29,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my phone's ringing.

86
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:34,523
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

87
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:36,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not answering you on air, sorry.

88
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,427
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my booty call.

89
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:38,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh oh, Rob's got his booty call.

90
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,391
Whale.

91
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So, the chat room right now, they're trying to get me to go to Vegas.

92
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:54,417
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they want all of us to come to Vegas, really, to do a show on the road in Vegas.

93
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:55,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

94
00:09:55,798 --> 00:10:03,700
[SPEAKER_16]: How are we going to... Well, I know that my buddy Irene, Rice Princess, she turned 21 this week, and now she's thinking about doing a Vegas trip.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it was supposed to be Reno this weekend.

96
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,841
[SPEAKER_16]: We were all going to go to Reno.

97
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Prostitution is legal in Vegas, right?

98
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:13,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Prostitution is not legal in Vegas or Vegas County, I don't think.

99
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,203
[SPEAKER_16]: But outside it is.

100
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Sucks.

101
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

102
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't it legal in Nevada in general?

103
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, but certain cities have it.

104
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,271
[SPEAKER_17]: There's like some big brothel that's right outside.

105
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustang Ranch.

106
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,332
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Mustang Ranch, man.

107
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:36,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the one time on Under Station Live, the show I used to do on Saturday nights, we actually called the Bunny Ranch and got an interview with some prostitutes at the Bunny Ranch.

108
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,074
[SPEAKER_16]: It was great radio.

109
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:40,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe once we get that capability set up here, we can...

110
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,449
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to interview some prostitutes, Jamie?

111
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:43,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

112
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,050
[SPEAKER_17]: What's it like to be a whore?

113
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,171
[SPEAKER_17]: You are a whore, darling.

114
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:56,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of whores, I made Jamie watch the best movie about Vegas that's ever been made.

115
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Showgirls.

116
00:10:59,116 --> 00:10:59,977
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion picture.

117
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:02,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Three hours of stripping crap.

118
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:03,579
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so bad.

119
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:08,241
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why it is fun to watch because it is so freaking horrible.

120
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,522
[SPEAKER_17]: What's our folks from Saved by the Bell?

121
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:18,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Jesse Spano was her... Well, it's Elizabeth Berkley is her real name, but she was Jesse Spano on Saved by the Bell.

122
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:27,036
[SPEAKER_16]: She was most famous in one episode, which... Spazzy, I don't know if he's listening right now, but he was trying to send me an episode of this, and it's been sending, like, all night long.

123
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:33,579
[SPEAKER_16]: He was sending me an episode of Saved by the Bell when Jesse has her caffeine pill addiction, and she breaks down.

124
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,920
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so excited!

125
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so excited!

126
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so scared!

127
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:40,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody else here watched Saved by the Bell?

128
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody.

129
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,102
[SPEAKER_16]: You did, yes.

130
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:45,044
[SPEAKER_16]: I knew somebody else here had to have seen it.

131
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:51,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to be an avid Saved by the Bell fan when I was on TV, and then Saved by the Bell at college years, and then Saved by the Bell at the movies.

132
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:52,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's a little much.

133
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:53,271
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a dork.

134
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up!

135
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Zack's so dreamy.

136
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,278
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, Loki's a dork.

137
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:03,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's running a radio station out of his house?

138
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:05,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, fuck you.

139
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:05,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Not me.

140
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:06,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just visiting.

141
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,244
[SPEAKER_16]: You're here, bastard.

142
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,385
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

143
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, there.

144
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:15,068
[SPEAKER_16]: We got people in the chat room admitting that they used to watch that show.

145
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,270
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't watch Saved by the Bell because I think I was busy watching cartoons.

146
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,852
[SPEAKER_16]: What cartoons were you watching instead of Saved by the Bell?

147
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Saved by the Bell came on after all the cartoons.

148
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:31,177
[SPEAKER_17]: I was taping Ronin Warriors in the morning while I was still asleep and then watching my tape when I got home in the afternoon after I watched all my other shows.

149
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, aren't you special?

150
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I am, quite.

151
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:37,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, Saved by the Bell, Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

152
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:38,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Her debut.

153
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:41,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Nah, Loki's giving the thumbs up to that, yes.

154
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,475
[SPEAKER_15]: She was hot.

155
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:45,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Now she's, like, stupid.

156
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,836
[SPEAKER_16]: What show is she on now?

157
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:49,737
[SPEAKER_16]: She's on some show on Fox, isn't she?

158
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,538
[SPEAKER_15]: She was on, like... She was on 90210.

159
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:52,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

160
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And now she's, like, in bit parts in B-movies and stuff.

161
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:57,737
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

162
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,301
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I don't like to acknowledge the Ducks to Dunks sequel.

163
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:19,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, okay, okay.

164
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:23,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, granted, number two did have Bruce Campbell in, so that made number two decent.

165
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:24,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha!

166
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:25,343
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to see that, then.

167
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Bruce Campbell was in Sacramento last week, by the way.

168
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:27,924
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

169
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Bruce Campbell did a signing at Borders or something.

170
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:31,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I just heard about it, like, last minute.

171
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:32,565
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

172
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,727
[SPEAKER_15]: We saw him when he went to the crest and did, uh... Nah.

173
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:38,507
[SPEAKER_15]: We saw Evil Dead.

174
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:39,267
[SPEAKER_15]: There he is.

175
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,188
[SPEAKER_17]: My friend has himself on videotape with Bruce Campbell at E3.

176
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,329
[SPEAKER_16]: What was Bruce Campbell doing at E3?

177
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because he's Bruce Campbell.

178
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,700
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

179
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we saw him when he was down at the Crust Theater, and it was pretty cool because he was doing signings and stuff.

180
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:14,503
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they did a screening of Evil Dead 2, you know, Dead by Dawn, which was great.

181
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Great movie.

182
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:23,624
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really fun to watch in a theater full of people, especially people I've seen the movie before, because everyone's just all cheering at the right spots, you know.

183
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:25,185
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like, bullshit.

184
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,485
[SPEAKER_15]: And everyone's like, yeah!

185
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:26,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

186
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:40,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Why can't we get a screening of Showgirls at the Crest with, like, Elizabeth Berkley live and the chick who played the mama at the strip bar who had the... She'd go like that and her top would fly off and she was really ugly.

187
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,854
[SPEAKER_15]: She can bump on... Oh, no, not the big fat chick.

188
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking Elizabeth Berkley.

189
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:51,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, if we want to recreate... Elizabeth Berkley looks like a skank.

190
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:51,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Ew.

191
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Looks like my sister.

192
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Quacks like a duck, must be a duck.

193
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,980
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't care.

194
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,981
[SPEAKER_16]: You can put a paper bag on her head.

195
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:02,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, don't ruin it.

196
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:07,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Make, Edit, Get Porn

197
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:28,839
[SPEAKER_15]: and you send that edit to me in any form.

198
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:38,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you can make the edit with a Japanese version of, you know, a DDR game that happens to have the same song that, you know, is in DDR Max USA.

199
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:47,388
[SPEAKER_15]: DWI, you make an .sm file, just some way to get step chart, some way to get it to me and then, you know, I'll take care of the rest and send you out a big box of porn.

200
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,089
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how it works.

201
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried proposing this to the DDR Maniacs forums and they just didn't get it.

202
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:54,692
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all...

203
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:57,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the idea of an edit contest, but why porn?

204
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:02,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've done other edit contests before and they're like, but why porn?

205
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Because everything else has been done.

206
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:05,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Yo, can you do a normal edit?

207
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:07,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I want boys.

208
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, sorry, I don't have that.

209
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,518
[SPEAKER_16]: We will find a way to maybe donate some boy porn to the contest.

210
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:13,938
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see if we can figure something out.

211
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,619
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know if we'll have DVDs necessarily, but we'll get boy porn in one way or another.

212
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for the ladies, okay?

213
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:22,751
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, anyways.

214
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:24,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, go ahead, Dave.

215
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:29,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of, like, getting boy porn for the winner, how about just donate boy porn to Jamie?

216
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't think anyone else, including me, would want boy porn.

217
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:38,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, now, we're neglecting some locals like Anita, DDRholic, Rice Princess.

218
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,321
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

219
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,022
[SPEAKER_16]: There's folks out there that might want boy porn.

220
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:42,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Who knows?

221
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:43,282
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get it.

222
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:52,448
[SPEAKER_17]: If, you know, guys are, can talk about, you know, just all girl porn, you know, why can't we have our all boy porn?

223
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:54,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying that you can't.

224
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying that, well, would you want girl porn, like girl on girl, girl on girl action?

225
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:04,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Because homosexuality is wrong and fags go to hell, but being a lesbian is okay.

226
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:07,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I, I don't.

227
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:11,923
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't find fake body parts okay to be that attractive.

228
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:13,924
[SPEAKER_17]: I like seeing pretty boys with nice abs.

229
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,724
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not fake, they're enhanced.

230
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have you know those are ab implants, okay?

231
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:28,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, but anyways, if I got free guy porn, then sure, I'd throw in free guy porn, but I just get free girl porn, so that's what's going in the box.

232
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:33,554
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, no one did understand why I was doing a contest to get porn.

233
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, because it's funny.

234
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:35,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's porn!

235
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's fun!

236
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,962
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all, why don't you do a normal contest with regular prizes?

237
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:47,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So first I kind of caved for about a minute, and I said, eh, fuck them.

238
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:51,492
[SPEAKER_16]: You want a normal at a contest, go enter Turnham Mix 3 or whatever.

239
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,494
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a pornographic edit contest.

240
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:59,098
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called Make Edit Get Porn, not Make Edit Get Something Not Porn.

241
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:04,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I should have made that rule that all the titles for the edits have to be sexually ambiguous.

242
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:06,123
[SPEAKER_17]: P-E-R-0-N.

243
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:08,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Prawn.

244
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:13,469
[SPEAKER_15]: If JB wins it, he'll try to deep fry it and you'll have deep fried prawn.

245
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:26,591
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but seriously, there'll be quite a bit of stuff in this box here.

246
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,512
[SPEAKER_15]: That might be the slight problem, though.

247
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:36,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, this contest is only open for anyone of age that can view porn in your state or county.

248
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,017
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as, if you enter, I'm assuming that you're of age and that you're... Or convincing enough to lie about it.

249
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:44,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, if you enter, I am assuming that you're of age.

250
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Do not tell me otherwise.

251
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,982
[SPEAKER_15]: It's don't ask, don't tell.

252
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:52,166
[SPEAKER_16]: If you cannot have pornography mailed to your house, don't enter.

253
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.

254
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and we're not talking about a little bit of porn.

255
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,493
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking a lot of porn.

256
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:08,680
[SPEAKER_15]: So, this is going to... We'll arrange, you know, transportation of the porn to your house, but...

257
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,637
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll arrange a nice brown paper bag.

258
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

259
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:15,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, not a little bit of porn, like a whole two and a half days worth of porn.

260
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:16,542
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot.

261
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:19,745
[SPEAKER_17]: It will paint a little green door on the package.

262
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:34,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, yeah, so the contest is still on, I have no entrance yet, but I haven't even announced a date for it, so... So, I mean, you know, whenever, I'll think of a date.

263
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,239
[SPEAKER_15]: In the meantime, just get your edits ready and...

264
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:54,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though a lot of people aren't entering, like, haven't signed up or whatever for entering, I know that there is a lot of hype going on, especially within the Sakpamani forums, about people wanting to enter this, such as Orange Beanie and me and other people.

265
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:58,000
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't restricted just to Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento.

266
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,820
[SPEAKER_16]: It's everybody.

267
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Nationwide.

268
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:00,461
[SPEAKER_16]: International.

269
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:01,662
[SPEAKER_16]: International.

270
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,824
[SPEAKER_16]: If you live in Belgium and you want prawn, enter.

271
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:08,166
[SPEAKER_17]: As long as you have the right region for your DVD player, or a good hack.

272
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:10,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, that's a good point though, because they're all U.S.

273
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:10,767
[SPEAKER_15]: region DVDs.

274
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:13,869
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to actually limit it to the continental United States.

275
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,750
[SPEAKER_15]: What about Canada?

276
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:21,974
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that it gets a little expensive to ship stuff to other countries.

277
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:22,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's true.

278
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Continental U.S.

279
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:23,955
[SPEAKER_16]: then only.

280
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Continental U.S., yes.

281
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:30,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, if somebody internationally wants to enter, maybe we'll just send you some net porn.

282
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,467
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll send you a few dirty pictures.

283
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,268
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll arrange something, yeah, for those who can't do that.

284
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:46,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually found, you know, this is really sad, is someone made a Nintendo 64 emulated porn.

285
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,052
[SPEAKER_16]: A Nintendo 64 porn?

286
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,433
[SPEAKER_16]: What is that, Mario Party or something?

287
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:53,934
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's just like, I don't know, it's like they made a ROM file with porn in it.

288
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:54,974
[SPEAKER_15]: It's weird.

289
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:55,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Wahoo.

290
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,244
[SPEAKER_17]: They have those for Super Nintendo.

291
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,927
[SPEAKER_17]: There's like 30 pictures in them.

292
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:03,811
[SPEAKER_17]: I downloaded this ROM that was labeled as this game I wanted and it was porn.

293
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

294
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:08,157
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like big, you know, twat shot porn.

295
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:08,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Ew.

296
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:08,938
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't...

297
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Need to see pixelated cooter, okay?

298
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus they had an option.

299
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:22,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess what it does is it activates the rumble pack for a very long time.

300
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,618
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the vibrate function.

301
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:28,082
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was really weird, but yeah.

302
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:30,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It's out there.

303
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:36,633
[SPEAKER_14]: You have no idea how many times I, like, click on something for Kazaa, and it's like, Initial D, episode 22.

304
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:41,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Click on, oh, oh, wait, that's not Initial D, that looks like porn.

305
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Not Initial D. Yeah, that pissed me off.

306
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:47,623
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to find Jackass, the movie, and I ended up getting Sorority Boys.

307
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, then you see the male ass.

308
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, no!

309
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:55,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I'm downloading Chamber of Secrets right now, because I didn't get to go today.

310
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you and your Harry Potter.

311
00:21:59,163 --> 00:21:59,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of porn.

312
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:01,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

313
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of porn, Harry Potter, come on.

314
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:07,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I got lost.

315
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Although I do know where to get to, didn't you?

316
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:12,321
[SPEAKER_14]: How was Harry Potter anyway?

317
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:13,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Very, very good.

318
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:14,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

319
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:18,805
[SPEAKER_17]: We're planning on having a trip again to go see it sometime very soon if you want to come and join in on the action.

320
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:19,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sure.

321
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Lots of me drooling over Alan Rickman on screen.

322
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:23,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, Alan Rickman on screen.

323
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,429
[SPEAKER_17]: God, he was so fabulous.

324
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,210
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think of him as fabulous like that.

325
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:33,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Harry Potter.

326
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:34,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Word.

327
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:36,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, speaking of... Go from porn to Harry Potter.

328
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of pornography, no, I have something that still goes along the lines of pornography.

329
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,814
[SPEAKER_16]: This has kind of been circulating a lot of the web boards this week.

330
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,964
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been given this link that talks about the DDR up the skirt camera.

331
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:55,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you guys, I'll post the link in the chat room for those that maybe haven't seen this, although I think it's been whored out on just about every forum out there.

332
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to mention at least five live journals.

333
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:59,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, like different live journals and such.

334
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:02,470
[SPEAKER_16]: But just in case, there's the link in the chat room for you guys.

335
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,533
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically a pornography where it shows these Japanese schoolgirls, of course they're dressed like Catholic schoolgirls, you wouldn't have it any other way.

336
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Sailor dresses.

337
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they all look like Sailor Moon.

338
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:18,456
[SPEAKER_16]: and there's a little camera right in the center of a DDR pad that films up their skirt.

339
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,737
[SPEAKER_17]: They even have a diagram illustrating where the camera is.

340
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:24,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it just points out, you know, insert camera here.

341
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,240
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a big black dot.

342
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, we should translate this page, shouldn't we?

343
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:32,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I should run this through the translator because I haven't done that yet.

344
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:32,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

345
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,324
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think of this while I get it translated?

346
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,431
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to do it really well, and...

347
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's really that working.

348
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

349
00:24:11,822 --> 00:24:14,505
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the English translation of the website.

350
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we do some reading of the English translation of the website here?

351
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:19,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Go for it.

352
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I'm trying to get some website reading music here.

353
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I just don't see how, like...

354
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:30,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I can think of that you could hide the camera pretty well, but how many girls wear, like, mini skirts in play?

355
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:33,592
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I've ever seen a girl wear a skirt or a mini skirt in play.

356
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,374
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's hear what this porn cam site's advertising here.

357
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:39,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Meanwhile, we have, like, the guys all ogling at the screen.

358
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:46,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Make It Wait, ah, carried out.

359
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:51,919
[SPEAKER_16]: A Playwoman quantity student's lower half of the body, collection of images of a shock.

360
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,920
[SPEAKER_16]: The fourth cartridge, a ban, is removed at last.

361
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,122
[SPEAKER_16]: This time it photographs before the first game in series and photography is ventured.

362
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:05,765
[SPEAKER_16]: What surrender women quantity student with sufficient super qua?

363
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:10,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Lump, T-Back, Photography, a success!

364
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:16,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's hear it for Nifty at Global Gate.

365
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:21,792
[SPEAKER_16]: The woman quantity students aimed at this time total six sets.

366
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:26,733
[SPEAKER_16]: It clicks on each lower photograph and is to a verification page.

367
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's like letting me view.

368
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:31,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, close-ups!

369
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:34,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, it's... Oh, ass!

370
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:35,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

371
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:36,738
[SPEAKER_16]: K.O.

372
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:41,362
[SPEAKER_16]: are the women who show splendid dancing, like, while swaying the flair.

373
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:46,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we can tell it... It seems to be the dance of a proposal of marriage completely.

374
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:48,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, let me just put it this way.

375
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:52,410
[SPEAKER_15]: They haven't been playing DDR very long, so they got some serious roles in that ass.

376
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,172
[SPEAKER_15]: People like to be...

377
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:02,128
[SPEAKER_16]: The whiter panties to the upper one of the leg extended smoothly, which seemed to be warm.

378
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,450
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a fortunate shot.

379
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it noticed that a camera is... Japanese.

380
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:10,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Exciting moment.

381
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:14,285
[SPEAKER_17]: She's looking right down at the camera.

382
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:20,387
[SPEAKER_16]: A Supa Mini and loose exquisite balance and snow white panties cannot be removed too!

383
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,889
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanna hear something very ironic about this whole thing?

384
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:30,174
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no way that they wouldn't show anything other than a panty shot because it's illegal to show anything like that in Japan in the first place.

385
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:30,814
[SPEAKER_15]: It totally blurs out.

386
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Doesn't this look like a cooter right there?

387
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:34,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Like this chick's not wearing underwear?

388
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:36,559
[SPEAKER_16]: But is it just the lighting?

389
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,160
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I can't click on it.

390
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, I'm trying to look at more verification page.

391
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:45,181
[SPEAKER_16]: See if we can see some... Oh, I don't know.

392
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:51,683
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just white panties everywhere.

393
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,044
[SPEAKER_16]: So it doesn't say how to order.

394
00:26:58,884 --> 00:26:59,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it?

395
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:00,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me click on one of these.

396
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:01,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see how we order one.

397
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:02,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

398
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:05,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we want to see how much they cost.

399
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:07,544
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to have one shipped to your house.

400
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,264
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

401
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:15,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

402
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,531
[SPEAKER_17]: It's loading.

403
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,153
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not giving me shit.

404
00:27:19,493 --> 00:27:21,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would you want shit?

405
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:23,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh well.

406
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,081
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you pointing at?

407
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:29,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the link.

408
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's a Shockwave file.

409
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:31,342
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what I'm going to get.

410
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:32,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

411
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that's enough of that.

412
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:35,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's click on this Shockwave file I've been getting.

413
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:41,264
[SPEAKER_16]: So, any chance we'll ever see a series like this in America?

414
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Panty Panty Revolution?

415
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:49,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about that, but I'm sure they could put the Girls Gone Wild chicks on there, jumping around.

416
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Just take a DDR machine and Mardi Gras.

417
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:55,555
[SPEAKER_16]: and let fun ensue.

418
00:27:57,736 --> 00:27:58,977
[SPEAKER_15]: I see prophets!

419
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:00,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways.

420
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea what this is that I just got in the chatroom.

421
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,083
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a fish with legs.

422
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,866
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a fish with legs and it's speaking a lot of Japanese.

423
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:19,333
[SPEAKER_17]: He has a fish for a head and he's wearing a loincloth and a cape.

424
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:22,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Kikkoman!

425
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like a soy sauce.

426
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they can.

427
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he just shoot a laser out of his nipple?

428
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,722
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a kitty eating a fried egg.

429
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Show me, show you, show me, show you Show me, show you, show you, show me

430
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:04,291
[SPEAKER_16]: They look like little kittens.

431
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:05,912
[SPEAKER_16]: They look like fried kittens.

432
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just say pussy?

433
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:09,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one soy sauce.

434
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:09,814
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

435
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes.

436
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, somebody hung the kitten.

437
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:35,294
[SPEAKER_03]: How sad.

438
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:40,937
[SPEAKER_03]: That was homoerotic right there.

439
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That was brawn right there.

440
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,341
[SPEAKER_16]: A banana, a mushroom, and a fish.

441
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Ice cream popsicle.

442
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,766
[SPEAKER_16]: See, isn't that homoerotic right there?

443
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,201
[SPEAKER_16]: That was beautiful.

444
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm inspired to go eat sushi now.

445
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:07,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Suggestion in the chatroom.

446
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,645
[SPEAKER_16]: They should make Douche Douche Revolution.

447
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,167
[SPEAKER_16]: What else is the chatroom saying?

448
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Strip Strip Revolution.

449
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Girls Gone Wild DDR.

450
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:17,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Lose a song, take your top off.

451
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:19,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Strip DDR.

452
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:24,052
[SPEAKER_16]: You probably have to get the girls drunk first.

453
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:33,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I was talking to someone that, uh, used to know the people that did the Girls Gone Wild, uh, tapes, and, yeah, that's what they do, is get them drunk first.

454
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:39,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Jamie, uh, we're getting a suggestion about maybe boy porn for the DDR, same thing.

455
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:46,108
[SPEAKER_16]: You never know when guys might be free-balling and wearing baggy shorts, so... Ooh!

456
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:48,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Pantsless rage indeed.

457
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you think they'd be able to feel the breeze a little bit?

458
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:54,354
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like DDR-ing in the nude, Jesus.

459
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't it be painful?

460
00:30:58,055 --> 00:30:58,755
[SPEAKER_16]: I would think so.

461
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:00,656
[SPEAKER_16]: How would it be painful?

462
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:04,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Floppy, floppy, floppy.

463
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:08,100
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a woman and you have big boobs, you'd be whacking yourself in the face.

464
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Once, me and Pauliver, one of the first times I played, I went down to the Riptide Arcade, the old one.

465
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Before it was the Riptide Arcade or whatever.

466
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,726
[SPEAKER_14]: The old place in Pier 39, before it moved.

467
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:26,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was this one girl who was playing and her boobs were bouncing up and down so much.

468
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:28,388
[SPEAKER_14]: She was like Jiggle Jiggle Revolution, I think we called it.

469
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,269
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to go throw up now.

470
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,909
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I saw a freestyle like that the other day.

471
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:33,770
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to go throw up a lot now.

472
00:31:34,363 --> 00:31:35,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we going to take a quick break and come back?

473
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:36,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's take a quick break.

474
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we're going to take a really quick break and we'll come right back.

475
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,268
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we come back, we'll get off the pornography subject.

476
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah right.

477
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,712
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll talk to Black Lab a little more because he's our special guest.

478
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to interview him while he's here.

479
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:54,135
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to get to a request that we had in the chat room a little bit earlier.

480
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:56,136
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from 2DX8Style.

[SPEAKER_16]: Pop music.

00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,141
[SPEAKER_17]: I get it.

510
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Still sounds vaguely... Click, click, click, click, ding.

511
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:34,504
[SPEAKER_17]: ...vaguely twatty.

512
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:37,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you just say it sounds twatty?

00:40:38,553 --> 00:40:39,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I did!

[SPEAKER_16]: And we run it a half hour later.

516
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:50,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that on?

517
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:52,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Which means it's three hours long.

518
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,238
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the webcam is on.

519
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, because people would be looking at my feet right now.

520
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,160
[SPEAKER_16]: The big show starts now at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So wake up earlier.

522
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:02,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

523
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Get your ass here earlier.

524
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:06,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Black Lab.

525
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:06,462
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

526
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:07,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk to Black Lab.

527
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:09,625
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our favorite puppy.

528
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

529
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:12,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Good puppy.

530
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Sit.

531
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Sit, Ubu, sit.

532
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:18,095
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm already on the ground, dammit.

533
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:20,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, because you can't have my chair.

534
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab's already sitting here on his knees.

535
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't go there!

536
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:28,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't go there.

537
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:56,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes?

538
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:56,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

539
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:06,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I had my experience working at Castro Valley Golf Land and I know it's small and I know it's probably most people consider it ghetto because Milpitas and Sunnyvale are much bigger.

540
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Living in the ghetto.

541
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:10,984
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not really ghetto, it's more like, well, it's Castro Valley.

542
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:17,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a white and partially Latino hood.

543
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

544
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's up in the hills.

545
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:22,707
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not like down in the city area.

546
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,129
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not even a real city, though.

547
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what kind of Bomani games do they have in Castro Valley?

548
00:42:28,018 --> 00:42:32,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we have the usual standard Max 2s.

549
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we have a 3rd Korean, yeah!

550
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:36,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't see many of those anymore.

551
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:38,168
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we also have a 4th Plus.

552
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:44,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, a US version of Guitar Freaks and a Beat Stage 5th Mix.

553
00:42:44,914 --> 00:42:46,535
[SPEAKER_16]: With a discolored screen, I might add.

554
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,738
[SPEAKER_16]: What exactly did you used to do at Castro Adolfo?

555
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:49,979
[SPEAKER_16]: You weren't a tech, you just...

556
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I was general maintenance.

557
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I made sure the place didn't collapse on itself.

558
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:00,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, were you there for the big tournament they did at Caster Valley a couple months ago?

559
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:03,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

560
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:05,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Most people probably don't know this.

561
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:08,704
[SPEAKER_16]: If it weren't for me, that whole thing would have fallen flat on its frickin' face.

562
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:09,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I see.

563
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:11,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Ego, ego.

564
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,426
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm serious though.

565
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:24,888
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like the main link to the management and it kind of got screwed over at the last minute without my knowledge because I was trying to make sure that the machine would be going outside for the tournament.

566
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:30,790
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, the manager changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to tell anyone until the next morning.

567
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:39,012
[SPEAKER_16]: When I'm there an hour before the place even opens to get this machine moved outside and the supervisor that morning comes in and is like,

568
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:40,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the machine's not going outside.

569
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm like, oh shit.

570
00:43:44,813 --> 00:43:55,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And I pretty much damn near killed myself trying to make sure there was enough room for people to be in there, and I ended up missing pretty much the entire tournament because I had a migraine from nearly killing myself.

571
00:43:56,502 --> 00:43:56,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Ouch.

572
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:57,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:00,806
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I had to come and clean up after you bastards!

574
00:44:01,546 --> 00:44:02,907
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't go, so you didn't clean up after me.

575
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:06,350
[SPEAKER_17]: And why didn't we have any fucking music playing during that?

576
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,784
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not really as fuck you.

577
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:09,685
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not really as fuck you.

578
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:11,247
[SPEAKER_16]: That's as fuck you of like three months ago.

579
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:12,428
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the fuck you of this week.

580
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:13,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to those later.

581
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Post-dated FU.

582
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you have to catch up.

583
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:20,436
[SPEAKER_16]: You usually send about ten FUs of the week every week, so.

584
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:22,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's been kind of going down lately.

585
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:24,720
[SPEAKER_16]: You're getting a little happier with life.

586
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:25,760
[SPEAKER_16]: A little.

587
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,381
[SPEAKER_16]: But so now you've moved from Castro Valley to the wide, wonderful... I didn't live in Castro Valley.

588
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:34,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I lived in San Leandro, which is like... Which is right nearby, obviously, if you were to Castro Valley, right, okay.

589
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,982
[SPEAKER_16]: But you've moved basically to Sacramento.

590
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:42,843
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't live in Sacramento, but you live in the People's Republic of Davis, which is a small hippie town just, you know, right outside of Sacramento.

591
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:43,723
[SPEAKER_17]: With a college!

592
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:43,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wow.

593
00:44:43,923 --> 00:44:45,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

594
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:48,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Abandon hope I have.

595
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:51,965
[SPEAKER_16]: So how does Davis differ than the Bay Area for you?

596
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:53,065
[SPEAKER_16]: It's full...

597
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:56,375
[SPEAKER_17]: You get a fine for breathing.

598
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:01,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Davis, by the way, the town that arrested the lady for snoring too loud, I think.

599
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't that Davis?

600
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear anything about Davis.

601
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That was years ago.

602
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:07,505
[SPEAKER_16]: It was probably before you were born.

603
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:10,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty little flat college town with absolutely nothing in it.

604
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,129
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's boring as hell.

605
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And the college sucks because they aren't letting first year students have their cars when there's plenty of parking.

606
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:20,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hating it.

607
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:21,486
[SPEAKER_16]: and Calamari

608
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it would be shrimp too, but they ran out of the shrimp there.

609
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:47,344
[SPEAKER_16]: It's sad, but... But it's a max one there, and it's like, the volume's not that loud, and... Yeah.

610
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,184
[SPEAKER_16]: So how did you get into playing DDR?

611
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:54,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it something... Were you working at CBGL before Bomani got big and they got the game one day?

612
00:45:55,247 --> 00:46:02,089
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I... Listen, it was almost two years ago when I started, when I actually first played DDR.

613
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:03,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Where did you first play DDR?

614
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,510
[SPEAKER_16]: At Caster Valley Golf Land, as a matter of fact.

615
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:05,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

616
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:06,131
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

617
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:13,934
[SPEAKER_16]: I just played the USA mix there and failed, stomped to my beat on my first song, and yeah, I was pretty much hooked after that.

618
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:18,776
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've lost many hours and many 20s since then.

619
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:24,938
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, you didn't get the job at Golfland so you could play more free DDR, did you?

620
00:46:25,238 --> 00:46:26,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that's sad.

621
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:27,259
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't.

622
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:30,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I needed a tour.

623
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,681
[SPEAKER_16]: I knew people that were there, and they knew me, and it made it easier to get a job there for a summer job to get money to go to college.

624
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:45,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the free only $20 in tokens every two weeks that I got wasn't that big.

625
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,824
[SPEAKER_16]: But hey, at least I got to play some stuff.

626
00:46:49,984 --> 00:46:50,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

627
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:50,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

628
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:53,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that's Black Lab, everybody.

629
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

630
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:56,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

631
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,727
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what do we talk about now?

632
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:01,449
[SPEAKER_16]: We gotta fill three hours in this bitch.

633
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:03,931
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the moment on Orange Lounge where we yodel.

634
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Give the mic to Loki, he's got something to say.

635
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:11,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Has anyone out there seen that show, um, Three South?

636
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:13,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Three South?

637
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:15,120
[SPEAKER_16]: No, what station's that on?

638
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,720
[SPEAKER_15]: MTV.

639
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:17,302
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't watch crap.

640
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:19,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I broke the clip again.

641
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, anyways, no, it's this really cool cartoon.

642
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want the clip or the mic?

643
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:26,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I want the clip.

644
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:31,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so it's this really pretty funny show, actually.

645
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:37,742
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the new cartoons they have on there, and it's about these three college guys, and from what I gathered, they're pretty retarded.

646
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,303
[SPEAKER_16]: SoCalKick says it's stupid.

647
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:41,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I watched it.

648
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:42,616
[SPEAKER_15]: It was funny.

649
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Your opinion counts for Jack.

650
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:46,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways.

651
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,582
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it was pretty funny.

652
00:47:49,623 --> 00:47:52,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Today's episode is about constructing the Stomach Pump 2000.

653
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:55,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

654
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that like Sorority Life, but animated?

655
00:47:59,852 --> 00:48:02,274
[SPEAKER_15]: With less bitching and no hot chicks.

656
00:48:02,294 --> 00:48:03,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorority Life was set in Davis.

657
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:06,498
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something Davis is famous for.

658
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:21,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, now we know publicly that there's plenty of bitches in, uh, fucking Davis Yeah, and that really helps me a lot Uh-huh Yeah I'm sorry to interrupt, you were talking about some crappy show on MTV?

659
00:48:23,746 --> 00:48:25,247
[SPEAKER_15]: It was entertaining, okay?

660
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:27,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I had fun watching it.

661
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:29,530
[SPEAKER_15]: I now know it's on Thursdays.

662
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:36,394
[SPEAKER_15]: It gives me something to watch on Thursdays before I'm waiting for, I don't know, the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

663
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:38,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that's quality television.

664
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:39,616
[SPEAKER_15]: That show owns.

665
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that show.

666
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know where the pin is.

667
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:44,459
[SPEAKER_15]: I lost the pin.

668
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:46,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I broke the clip again.

669
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:50,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't you think some of the older animated shows on MTV were much better, though?

670
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:58,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Beavis and Butthead, Aeon Flux, Liquid Television that brought birth to both of those two shows.

671
00:48:58,189 --> 00:48:58,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

672
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that rocked.

673
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Frog Baseball Ciffle and Ollie

674
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never heard of that.

675
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:20,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, it was the shit.

676
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:22,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's still online somewhere.

677
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:24,673
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, I haven't followed up on it.

678
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:27,095
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a show that did all of two shows of this on MTV.

679
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:31,077
[SPEAKER_17]: The Idiot Box with Alex Winter, as in Bill and Ted Fane.

680
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:32,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah.

681
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:35,660
[SPEAKER_17]: I just remember the one show where he got shot in the head at the beginning of it.

682
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,701
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the whole episode he was bleeding.

683
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:42,944
[SPEAKER_17]: And he didn't realize it until he reaches up to scratch his head and then he goes, Ah, I'm bleeding!

684
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:43,264
[SPEAKER_17]: And dies.

685
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:48,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then there was those two other shows that we probably want to forget about.

686
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:48,944
[SPEAKER_16]: The State.

687
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:49,685
[SPEAKER_16]: The State.

688
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, The State was like the best.

689
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:52,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, sorry.

690
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:54,406
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking about animated shows.

691
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:56,047
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking like The Head.

692
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:57,207
I liked The Head.

693
00:49:58,247 --> 00:49:59,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I liked The Head.

694
00:49:59,188 --> 00:49:59,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you.

695
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:00,628
[SPEAKER_15]: She likes Head.

696
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:04,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, and then there's also The Max.

697
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,050
[SPEAKER_17]: The Max was cool, too.

698
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:16,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I like when they were talking about the Izzes, the ones that were just like, I think it was the Izzes, the stupid slugs that would jump like 50 feet in the air and then couldn't land.

699
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:18,585
[SPEAKER_15]: They'd jump and just splat.

700
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:19,365
[SPEAKER_15]: It was cool.

701
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,565
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what we need an animated series of?

702
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:23,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

703
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:25,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we have Zim.

704
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:26,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, fuck that, dude.

705
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Johnny the Homicidal Maniac would be awesome.

706
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:30,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe later.

707
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Little Shorts of Happy Noodle Boy.

708
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:35,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Just Happy Noodle Boy would even be good.

709
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:44,789
[SPEAKER_16]: The chatroom, Vandalist in the chatroom is asking, does anybody remember a show on Nickelodeon called Turkey Television?

710
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,910
Barely.

711
00:50:46,571 --> 00:50:47,451
[SPEAKER_16]: I barely remember it too.

712
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:48,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember not liking it.

713
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:51,974
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the name, but like, barely anything about it.

714
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:55,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to watch Out of Control.

715
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:59,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that the one that the guy went cut it out?

716
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:00,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that?

717
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:01,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in a head.

718
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:01,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

719
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:02,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Diz.

720
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:03,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

721
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:04,500
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that looked like Cyndi Lauper.

722
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,060
[SPEAKER_16]: She would tell her story.

723
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

724
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

725
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that show was the shit.

726
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,680
[SPEAKER_17]: And the guy looked like Mark Summer from Double Dare, but it wasn't.

727
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

728
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:10,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I know what you're talking about.

729
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:11,301
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the guy from Full House.

730
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:12,661
[SPEAKER_16]: He did the cut it out.

731
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:13,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

732
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:14,342
[SPEAKER_16]: I hella remember that show.

733
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,702
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember seeing Atlantis.

734
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:19,423
[SPEAKER_16]: As long as we're reminiscing about old school TV.

735
00:51:19,463 --> 00:51:19,923
[SPEAKER_16]: And Pinwheel.

736
00:51:19,963 --> 00:51:20,883
[SPEAKER_16]: What else are they talking about here?

737
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:22,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Funhouse with J.D.

738
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:23,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Ross, man.

739
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,204
[SPEAKER_15]: That show was awesome.

740
00:51:26,664 --> 00:51:29,706
[SPEAKER_15]: That show fucking ruled.

741
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:33,187
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a computer game of Funhaus.

742
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:34,248
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the shit.

743
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:38,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I was actually looking up stuff about Funhaus this week, and they had a J.D.

744
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Ross fan club, and man, talk about that guy being fucking homo.

745
00:51:43,913 --> 00:51:46,174
[SPEAKER_15]: That guy was like a homo pedophile, I swear to God.

746
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:51,397
[SPEAKER_15]: He's sending photos of him just all sprawled out for children to enjoy.

747
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:55,239
[SPEAKER_15]: As Loki's imitating the pictures here in the corner of the room.

748
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:58,101
[SPEAKER_15]: That guy was sad.

749
00:51:58,321 --> 00:51:59,282
[SPEAKER_15]: That guy was really sad.

750
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:02,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he was like one step below Vanilla Ice.

751
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:04,926
[SPEAKER_15]: And just horrible.

752
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:06,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that show, but remember that J.D.

753
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Roth was also the host of GameProTV.

754
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:13,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I just brought this show to a screeching halt with that name.

755
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:14,373
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

756
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:18,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say, though, that Funhaus was awesome.

757
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,183
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of funny, though, because some of the prizes that they had to get, they had to stick to their head with, like, Velcro.

758
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:36,233
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like they'd have giant, like, boxes with the brand new Nintendo system, so they'd just, you know, stick that to their head, and they'd have to run out, and they'd get, like, cash and money and prizes and shit, and it was awesome.

759
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:37,634
[SPEAKER_15]: That show was awesome.

760
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:39,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, you'll appreciate this one, Jamie.

761
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you knew this show.

762
00:52:40,817 --> 00:52:43,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Skyline's asking if you remember a show called Out of This World.

763
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:44,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

764
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:55,408
[SPEAKER_17]: It was, ding, you put your fingers together and... Okay, in my live journal, one of my old icons was Troy, her dad, in his prismatic thingam-thingy.

765
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:59,732
[SPEAKER_16]: The show, the 280 shows I remember, because they used to be on back-to-back.

766
00:53:00,032 --> 00:53:01,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Small Wonder, thank you very much.

767
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:02,554
[SPEAKER_16]: That show was the shit.

768
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:03,635
[SPEAKER_17]: With Vicky.

769
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:07,178
[SPEAKER_16]: And the girl I used to actually have a crush on, Punky Brewster.

770
00:53:07,523 --> 00:53:08,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Punky Brewster was cool.

771
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:11,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Soleil Moon Frye.

772
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, did you hear Soleil Moon Frye had to get a boob job?

773
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,567
[SPEAKER_16]: She got her boobs reduced because they were so big.

774
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I just couldn't believe that, that Punky Brewster had big tits.

775
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:21,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, when you saw her, she had no tits.

776
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:25,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Because she was five or something.

777
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Twelve, you know.

778
00:53:27,192 --> 00:53:29,113
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't matter.

779
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:35,209
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, speaking, we've kind of been talking about game shows and TV shows.

780
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:44,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever hear those rumors a while back that they were filming a pilot for a Dance Dance Revolution game show, which has to be the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my entire life.

781
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:46,611
[SPEAKER_16]: A load of crap.

782
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:47,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

783
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:48,852
[SPEAKER_15]: It's even a bad joke.

784
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:52,253
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that took off about as well as, uh, the DDR movie?

785
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:56,176
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the DDR Freak movie, remember?

786
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:58,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it was a movie called DDR Freak.

787
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:04,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I've seen the supposed script for it, and it was bull and shit at the same time.

788
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:07,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that the script that started at Milpitas Golf Land?

789
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:12,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that was faker than Elizabeth Berkley's moves.

790
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:13,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried...

791
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:15,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Who wrote that again?

792
00:54:16,278 --> 00:54:19,621
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm pretty sure it was one of the South Bay folks, but I don't know.

793
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually tried at the time to get the script for it.

794
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:26,787
[SPEAKER_15]: However, the only way you can get... Was it... I think it was...

795
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:35,288
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure it's somebody that's now banned from DDR Freak.

796
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:37,830
[SPEAKER_16]: And for writing that piece of crap, you deserved it.

797
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:38,390
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

798
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:44,994
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually, I tried getting the script at the time when that was like the big news, you know, it was the stupid DDR Freak movie.

799
00:54:45,254 --> 00:54:45,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

800
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:55,497
[SPEAKER_15]: But the only problem was, the only way you could get a script of the movie is if you were a member of this casting group or whatever.

801
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:59,438
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I almost wanted to sign up for that just because I wanted to know.

802
00:54:59,718 --> 00:55:01,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to know how fake this shit was.

803
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone posted the whole script on DDR Freak.

804
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,200
[SPEAKER_17]: You could just go click the link and get it.

805
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:05,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

806
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was fake, though.

807
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:08,021
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in a thread.

808
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:10,502
[SPEAKER_17]: The supposed script, it was on there.

809
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:11,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

810
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, it was crap, and, yeah.

811
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:22,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have liked to see it made, I mean, because I've, to be honest, I've seen worse made, and it's actually sold.

812
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:27,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they could make a DDR movie, but not that group that was trying to do it.

813
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:31,634
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you don't, what, what the fuck did you do, pay money to be in a movie?

814
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:33,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me, let me go over a couple.

815
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:37,078
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to pay money to audition, that's lame.

816
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:40,699
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple actual movies that are out here.

817
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just see here.

818
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Spectrum Entertainment, they're an awesome company that distributes just anything that they get their hands on.

819
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:48,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean anything.

820
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, we've got Ankle Biters, the old midget vampire movie.

821
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:53,664
[SPEAKER_15]: That one's great.

822
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:56,345
[SPEAKER_15]: We have one that's called Night Chills.

823
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:56,805
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about...

824
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:16,755
[SPEAKER_15]: About, um, this guy that plays Dungeons and Dragons And then all of a sudden, like, people are getting killed that play Dungeons and Dragons By this guy that's dressed up like a giant knight in an armor suit thing It's crap And then there's another one called Envy Full title, Penis Envy It's about these two chicks that are wandering through the desert And just decide, you know what?

825
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:19,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Our lives would be a lot better if we had penises So what happens?

826
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:23,799
[SPEAKER_15]: This giant drag queen fairy Just, uh, the penis fairy goes

827
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:25,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you all have penises now!

828
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:37,049
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like a couple hours of them just like doing shit with their penises and growing mustaches and it's just really nasty shit and at the very end of the movie they make a trip down to L.A.

829
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:43,974
[SPEAKER_15]: to meet the penis fairy again and to get it removed and it ends in tragedy as like one of the girls gets shot and killed and

830
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:45,535
[SPEAKER_15]: I just really didn't care.

831
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:58,040
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no plot to the movie at all other than what would happen if two white trash hookers got penises and started running around screwing the white trash redneck locals there and yada yada yada yada.

832
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:02,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And like for some reason no one notices that they're chicks with mustaches with giant dicks.

833
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:05,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Did they have boobs too?

834
00:57:05,544 --> 00:57:06,504
[SPEAKER_16]: They had boobs and dicks?

835
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:09,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that would appear and disappear at will.

836
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:09,646
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like...

837
00:57:10,478 --> 00:57:12,359
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

838
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually have a collection of the worst movies known to man.

839
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:37,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually go out of my way to find these movies and buy them.

840
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:46,811
[SPEAKER_15]: The next two movies that have been sent to me are Feeders 2, rated 1, the lowest rated movie ever watched on SomethingAwful.com.

841
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:49,012
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm getting that movie.

842
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't forget Manos, The Hands of Fate.

843
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:52,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

844
00:57:52,513 --> 00:57:53,653
[SPEAKER_15]: That movie is so bad.

845
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:57,495
[SPEAKER_15]: It put me to sleep watching it on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.

846
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:01,316
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so bad that Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch it.

847
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:04,142
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awful.

848
00:58:04,722 --> 00:58:08,104
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there was also, what other ones did we get?

849
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:10,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, Wild Zero was pretty bad.

850
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:12,786
[SPEAKER_15]: That Japanese rock and roll punk.

851
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:18,548
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a punk rock zombie alien movie with some chick that was a guy.

852
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:20,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Weird shit.

853
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

854
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,932
[SPEAKER_15]: What other movies did I watch that were really crappy?

855
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:28,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see here.

856
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:44,238
[SPEAKER_15]: We had one, he came from Planet K. I had one really funny part in it where the alien walked up to this guy who got shot, picked up his gun, shot him in the leg, healed his leg, shot him in his leg again, healed his leg, shot him in the leg again.

857
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:46,380
[SPEAKER_15]: That was just hilarious at the time.

858
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:49,683
[SPEAKER_16]: So now what's your plan?

859
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:52,925
[SPEAKER_16]: How are we going to convince this company that they need to make a DDR movie?

860
00:58:54,154 --> 00:58:55,255
[SPEAKER_15]: You just made it to them.

861
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:56,096
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all, it's done?

862
00:58:56,236 --> 00:58:56,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll take it.

863
00:58:57,016 --> 00:59:00,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, so are we going to have to have Jamie star in the movie and, like, grow a dick?

864
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

865
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:06,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have to do some stunts like that?

866
00:59:06,323 --> 00:59:07,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Use Twin.

867
00:59:08,265 --> 00:59:11,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you need some, like, upskirt panty cam stuff going there.

868
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:14,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe a zombie just for kicks.

869
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe some topless chicks.

870
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:18,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And an exploding toilet.

871
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:20,554
[SPEAKER_15]: And people who can't act to save their life.

872
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:22,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

873
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:23,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, so we should all star in it.

874
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, they should make DDR Freak the porno.

875
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:36,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, you could cast like a bunch of hot Japanese chicks just playing DDR and having sex on the pad.

876
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:37,928
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Freak?

877
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:38,388
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no.

878
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:43,651
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Freak and hot Japanese people are not like two things that can be used in the same sense.

879
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:43,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

880
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:48,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, DDR sex freaks or something like that.

881
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:49,113
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

882
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:57,416
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, there's already hentai art done involving a dance pad that I've, like, seen one picture because someone posted it somewhere.

883
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:02,218
[SPEAKER_17]: I have not had the urge to go look for it, but I know it exists.

884
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:06,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does it seem like all of our conversations seem to stray back to porn?

885
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,560
[SPEAKER_16]: That's alright.

886
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Gets ratings.

887
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't know what it is.

888
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:11,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Hansel Strange, 3-2-9-E.

889
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:17,218
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, there was some really bad movies.

890
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:22,684
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one that was like an American vampire, and that was with Carmen Electra.

891
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:31,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was like some vampire, and then there was even, they actually had a part in this movie, a track that you can listen to, that was making fun of the movie.

892
01:00:31,313 --> 01:00:32,014
[SPEAKER_15]: It was so bad.

893
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:37,019
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a track, an audio track, where people were making fun of the movie.

894
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just like, okay.

895
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:41,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

896
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:46,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think we need to make that our mission, is we need to make an actual DDR movie.

897
01:00:47,174 --> 01:00:48,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge, the motion picture.

898
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:49,456
[SPEAKER_16]: How about it?

899
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:51,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's break out the 8mm cam.

900
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:54,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie, take off your top.

901
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,363
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Rob.

902
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,044
[SPEAKER_16]: It's for artistic purposes.

903
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:02,366
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Rob.

904
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:05,008
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

905
01:01:06,926 --> 01:01:07,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I have yo-yo.

906
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:12,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Man, if only I hadn't gotten rid of my hooker hook up there, man.

907
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:15,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I could have, like... Wait, you knew a hooker or something?

908
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:18,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we can go into this story.

909
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:19,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God.

910
01:01:19,293 --> 01:01:19,593
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

911
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:20,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

912
01:01:20,374 --> 01:01:21,434
[SPEAKER_16]: We got three hours to film now.

913
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:21,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

914
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:25,356
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a story of how I accidentally met a hooker.

915
01:01:26,337 --> 01:01:29,919
[SPEAKER_15]: And one can say, accidentally, how does one accidentally meet a hooker?

916
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:32,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's quite interesting, actually.

917
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:34,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And here's how it goes.

918
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:40,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, one day I decided, you know, I took a Friday off and I needed to get my hair cut because, you know, it kind of gets long sometimes.

919
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:43,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got my hair cut and everything, and this is during the summer once.

920
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:46,290
[SPEAKER_16]: You just got a haircut or you got them all cut?

921
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:49,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Worst joke ever.

922
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:50,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

923
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:51,758
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

924
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:19,251
[SPEAKER_15]: and, um, this, it looks like, I swear to God, she was, she couldn't have been that old, she, I thought it was a high school student, and looked like her little brother, so I, so they, so she's like, can we get a ride down the street to our apartment?

925
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,613
[SPEAKER_16]: She was in high school, I swear!

926
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:27,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear, well, that's what I thought it was, and they're like, it's kind of hot out here, can we get a ride down to our apartment?

927
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:28,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, where do you guys live?

928
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:30,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, just Creekside.

929
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:32,135
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, oh, okay, because there's a couple blocks down the street.

930
01:02:32,555 --> 01:02:39,740
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was fine, so they got in the car, and so I couldn't quite make the left to go to Creekside, which was two blocks, so I had to go around the block.

931
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:52,992
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, we go around the block and stuff, and her kid, you know, who I found out was her son, you know, was playing around in the backseat because I had a bunch of anime movies back there and stuff, and she was talking to me, and she kept hitting on me.

932
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:55,615
[SPEAKER_15]: She's all, she's all, so, what are you doing later?

933
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:58,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want, do you want to go out tonight?

934
01:02:58,878 --> 01:02:59,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Stuff like that.

935
01:02:59,599 --> 01:02:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, baby.

936
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Stuff like that.

937
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,103
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, I'm all, now I got a girlfriend, you know, I, I'm,

938
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:11,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually, you know, we're going out later and stuff, so I took her back to her place, and she's all, she's all, can I give you gas money?

939
01:03:11,546 --> 01:03:13,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Loki has a girlfriend that hates DDR.

940
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:19,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm just messing with you.

941
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, no, she'll play DDR, just when I'm not there.

942
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:28,753
[SPEAKER_15]: She played it like once in Tahoe, and, well anyways, back to the story, with the hooker.

943
01:03:29,213 --> 01:03:30,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so she...

944
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:35,394
[SPEAKER_15]: I take her back to her apartment and she's like, here, let me give you gas money.

945
01:03:35,514 --> 01:03:36,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, no, that's fine.

946
01:03:37,454 --> 01:03:39,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, so a hooker was going to pay you?

947
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:42,896
[SPEAKER_15]: She was going to pay me for gas money to give her a ride to her house.

948
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:44,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, right, gas money.

949
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:45,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Gas money, yes.

950
01:03:46,137 --> 01:03:54,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I refused the gas money because it was only... I refused the gas money because it was only... You were being a good Samaritan.

951
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,401
[SPEAKER_15]: I was being a good Samaritan.

952
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:59,002
[SPEAKER_15]: It was only a few blocks and it was like... You were helping your fellow hooker.

953
01:03:59,022 --> 01:03:59,182
[SPEAKER_15]: I was...

954
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:01,083
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know she was a hooker, okay?

955
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:04,505
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't gotten to the part where I figured out she was a hooker.

956
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:07,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now I thought she was some... Now she was?

957
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:09,589
[SPEAKER_16]: SoCalKick says she needed to fill up.

958
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, she was... Okay, she was pretty hot, okay?

959
01:04:14,412 --> 01:04:23,378
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was... I thought she was just some really desperate single mom who wanted some action or some shit like that.

960
01:04:23,718 --> 01:04:25,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Who happened to look like she was in high school.

961
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:35,459
[SPEAKER_15]: At the time, yeah, she looked pretty young, so, I mean, I placed her anywhere from, like, 17 to 20, low 20 range, so, I'm not good with age.

962
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Shit, man, now with age, I mean, fucking 12-year-olds look like 16-year-olds, so what am I supposed to judge?

963
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, how'd you find out she was younger?

964
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so, I refused my answer, she's like, here, you want a soda?

965
01:04:46,722 --> 01:04:51,043
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I was like, okay, so, I went into her apartment, probably mistake number one here.

966
01:04:51,163 --> 01:04:51,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoops!

967
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:56,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, oh, you were forced in at gunpoint into her apartment.

968
01:04:57,043 --> 01:04:57,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not forced!

969
01:04:58,003 --> 01:05:00,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted that damn soda, okay?

970
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:02,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you wanted to taste the sweet juice, yes.

971
01:05:06,185 --> 01:05:22,908
[SPEAKER_15]: So, went to her apartment, phone rang right when we got in there, so... Actually, it was kind of weird because I didn't quite realize it at first, but she had told her son to go play because mommy was working or something like that, and I was like, huh?

972
01:05:22,928 --> 01:05:22,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

973
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:41,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so we went to the apartment, I got, no, I got the soda, and she was, you know, the phone rang, so I just sat down drinking soda, and then, like, midway out of, like, fucking nowhere, because I guess it was her mom on the phone, she just, like, puts her hand over the phone, walks up to me, and she's like, do you want a blowjob?

974
01:05:41,878 --> 01:05:42,138
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like...

975
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no.

976
01:05:46,244 --> 01:05:47,286
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of man are you?

977
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:52,714
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I should have, but I said no, that's morally wrong.

978
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:56,540
[SPEAKER_16]: You should have said, yes, I want a blowjob, but not from you, you skanky whore.

979
01:05:57,102 --> 01:05:58,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, so I said no.

980
01:05:58,983 --> 01:05:59,863
[SPEAKER_15]: She got off the phone.

981
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,725
[SPEAKER_15]: She kind of explained to me how she was working.

982
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:05,546
[SPEAKER_15]: She thought I was like afraid that she was a cop or something.

983
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:09,268
[SPEAKER_15]: So she, you know, pulls down her shirt to show me her tits and says, you know.

984
01:06:09,308 --> 01:06:11,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that would have gone nice.

985
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:11,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

986
01:06:12,529 --> 01:06:14,130
[SPEAKER_16]: So there was some gratification in that.

987
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

988
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:15,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Got a nice brush.

989
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:16,151
[SPEAKER_15]: A reward.

990
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:17,592
[SPEAKER_15]: A reward, I guess.

991
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:21,534
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, she was just trying to prove to me that she wasn't wired or some shit like that.

992
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:21,714
[SPEAKER_15]: And

993
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:30,636
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was like, uh, no, that's really alright, no, so, and this is where I probably should have just said, fuck it, I'm leaving, yeah, just get me the hell out of here.

994
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:33,997
[SPEAKER_16]: But you got to see some titties, so now you were kind of wondering what's going to happen next.

995
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:43,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, but, okay, so now, so I was just like, okay, no, I can't do that, so, so she's like, okay, well, can I ask you another favor?

996
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, alright, what?

997
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,101
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, I need a ride down to Ranja, so I was like...

998
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, fine, because that's on my way home, so I was going to give her a ride down to Rancho for some reason.

999
01:06:52,386 --> 01:07:01,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we go down 50, and during the way she's, you know, talking to me and shit, and she's like, you know, still trying to push the hole, she wants to give me a blowjob thing.

1000
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:02,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1001
01:07:03,016 --> 01:07:08,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Ray, after refusing so many times, you'd think I'd say yes, but just for some reason, I still said no.

1002
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:17,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, she started explaining the whole basic business structure of prostitution, which is quite interesting, actually.

1003
01:07:18,894 --> 01:07:20,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Was she talking about her boss?

1004
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:22,317
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually, she was the pimp.

1005
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:27,946
[SPEAKER_15]: It's quite weird.

1006
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:30,587
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a really strange infrastructure she's got going there.

1007
01:07:30,727 --> 01:07:35,088
[SPEAKER_15]: She basically finds, you know, it's really easy to become pink.

1008
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:38,329
[SPEAKER_15]: You just gotta basically find women there walking around.

1009
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:41,131
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll know where they're going or what.

1010
01:07:41,211 --> 01:07:42,531
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll look lost and stuff.

1011
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:44,352
[SPEAKER_15]: You just say you'll take care of them.

1012
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,193
[SPEAKER_15]: They can make lots of money and that kind of shit.

1013
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:50,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now I was kind of tuning around listening to the radio.

1014
01:07:50,854 --> 01:07:55,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Then she started talking about how she had a bunch of apartments in different places and stuff like that.

1015
01:07:57,096 --> 01:08:01,558
[SPEAKER_15]: I took her to Rancho and she saw some other hooker walking around.

1016
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,598
[SPEAKER_15]: A hooker buddy.

1017
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:08,180
[SPEAKER_15]: She wanted me to come get this hooker to be my hooker.

1018
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be the pimp for this hooker.

1019
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, no, that's alright.

1020
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:12,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all...

1021
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:17,662
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all, I'm all, I gotta, and then she wanted to give me her pager number, so in case I had any friends.

1022
01:08:17,962 --> 01:08:21,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I, I thought about... Like, refer a friend to the wonderful world of whoredom.

1023
01:08:21,383 --> 01:08:22,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, exactly, and I get a cut off the top, you know?

1024
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:28,045
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I was like, maybe not, you know, that, no.

1025
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:32,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So then she got on my car finally, and that's why I sped off and went back home.

1026
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:36,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now, the question about all this.

1027
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:38,628
[SPEAKER_16]: How the fuck does this have anything to do with Bomani?

1028
01:08:39,769 --> 01:08:40,069
Okay.

1029
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:44,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we actually talk about Imani all day?

1030
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:49,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit, we're almost halfway through the show and we haven't talked about Imani.

1031
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:52,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh boy, okay.

1032
01:08:52,352 --> 01:08:57,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, anything else to add to your little wonderful wide world of whoredom story there?

1033
01:08:58,115 --> 01:09:00,917
[SPEAKER_15]: She also thought that I didn't want to blowjob her because she was black.

1034
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:05,305
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

1035
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:41,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Just send me your FUs of the week over private message in the chatroom And if you're not in our chatroom, you ought to get there You can get in right through our website now Just go to http://orangelounge.skie.cx And you can get to the chatroom from there Or if you want to send them over email

01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:43,814
[SPEAKER_16]: That's certainly possible as well.

1037
01:09:43,874 --> 01:09:48,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Just send an email to orangeloungeradio, all one word, at yahoo.com.

1038
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,179
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to send those right now.

1039
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,600
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you want to.

1040
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,263
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to start off this break with something from Max USA, I think.

1041
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:57,344
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like a good idea.

1042
01:09:57,464 --> 01:10:03,689
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's hear a song from Max USA, and then we're going to come back and do the FUs of the week.

1043
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:07,171
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to work an erotic song into this break, too, because it's pretty fitting.

1044
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,313
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll see you guys in a little bit.

1045
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:19,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the ball, I got the ball, I got the ball, I got the ball

1046
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:48,326
Yes, I ready to kick that ball, I need to make the call to drop the ball

1047
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we get into the next song, a real quick request.

1048
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:45,492
[SPEAKER_16]: JB in the chatroom wants to hear Jamie say, Poopy on JB's mommy.

1049
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:46,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Poopy on JB's mommy.

1050
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:48,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Big piles of feces.

1051
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:50,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me, give me, give me your love.

1052
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me, give me, give me your heart.

1053
01:11:53,754 --> 01:11:57,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me, give me, give me your passion.

1054
01:11:57,415 --> 01:11:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be loud.

1055
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:00,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Your body takes part.

1056
01:12:00,636 --> 01:12:01,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So let go.

1057
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:10,089
I will troll the back of you, come on, come on, I'll dream some too, I want you to

1058
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:30,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1059
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,848
Thanks for watching!

1060
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:53,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1061
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:55,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?

1062
01:17:55,794 --> 01:17:56,154
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1063
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we care what people think of us?

1064
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1065
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:03,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1066
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:07,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1067
01:18:08,406 --> 01:18:13,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1068
01:18:14,429 --> 01:18:19,790
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Porringe Lounge Radio, as somebody in the chat room referred to it earlier.

1069
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,630
[SPEAKER_17]: It's porntastic.

1070
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,690
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fat-tastic.

1071
01:18:24,611 --> 01:18:26,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Makes my mouth water.

1072
01:18:28,111 --> 01:18:30,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Where we don't talk about Pomani ever on this program.

1073
01:18:31,012 --> 01:18:32,152
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just a side show.

1074
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:33,632
[SPEAKER_17]: To DDR.

1075
01:18:34,493 --> 01:18:35,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha ha ha.

1076
01:18:35,593 --> 01:18:36,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Not here.

1077
01:18:36,473 --> 01:18:36,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1078
01:18:37,253 --> 01:18:42,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I know is Jamie's favorite segment, right?

1079
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:42,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1080
01:18:43,621 --> 01:18:43,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Teehee.

1081
01:18:44,682 --> 01:18:46,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this your favorite part of the show?

1082
01:18:46,164 --> 01:18:46,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes?

1083
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:47,045
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them.

1084
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:47,605
[SPEAKER_16]: One of them.

1085
01:18:48,286 --> 01:18:49,087
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the whole thing.

1086
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:58,176
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the FU of the week where Jamie just goes off on something that pisses her off and then we all play along.

1087
01:18:58,216 --> 01:18:59,498
[SPEAKER_16]: We all talk about things that piss us off.

1088
01:18:59,538 --> 01:19:00,419
[SPEAKER_16]: So, without further ado...

1089
01:19:01,877 --> 01:19:03,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, what the hell is pissing you off this time?

1090
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:07,281
[SPEAKER_17]: First thing that pisses me off is the fact that I've been using the same version of Schlagwerk.

1091
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:10,423
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think in the future when we should use the, quote, terror mix.

1092
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:14,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Well then, get me an MP3 of the terror mix and we'll do the terror mix.

1093
01:19:15,266 --> 01:19:15,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Easily done.

1094
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:20,090
[SPEAKER_17]: But now my real one goes toward the events that happened early this morning.

1095
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:23,392
[SPEAKER_17]: I was over here watching Showgirls.

1096
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,281
[SPEAKER_17]: You are a whore, darling.

1097
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:29,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, we were over here watching Showgirls.

1098
01:19:29,482 --> 01:19:31,643
[SPEAKER_17]: We went live on the show, which was fun and random.

1099
01:19:31,783 --> 01:19:37,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, which we do occasionally, which is more incentive to listen to our Bomani Music Amore program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station.

1100
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:38,565
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the show out.

1101
01:19:39,705 --> 01:19:41,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I get home.

1102
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:46,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew Dan was going to be having people over for that piece of shit Xbox Live crap.

1103
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:51,662
[SPEAKER_17]: I go in there and there's like everybody and God in my living room.

1104
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:52,983
[SPEAKER_16]: God was in your living room?

1105
01:19:53,324 --> 01:19:54,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, no.

1106
01:19:54,484 --> 01:19:54,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Amazing.

1107
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:56,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if God were there, he wouldn't be playing the Xbox.

1108
01:19:58,607 --> 01:19:59,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1109
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:00,588
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd be too busy smiting people.

1110
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:03,851
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd be playing Animal Crossing, where everybody can be a god.

1111
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:07,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I go, and there's just all these fucking people there.

1112
01:20:07,593 --> 01:20:08,454
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm exhausted.

1113
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:13,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So we go upstairs, we play some 2DX, and then Bailey will walk in and...

1114
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:15,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Ryan.

1115
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:16,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab.

1116
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:17,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I was tired.

1117
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Rise from your grave.

1118
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I was very hyper.

1119
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:21,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you see all that candy you ate?

1120
01:20:21,871 --> 01:20:22,991
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it was actually caffeine.

1121
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:23,111
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1122
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, this is my fuck you, so leave your candy out of it.

1123
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:25,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1124
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:26,352
[SPEAKER_17]: I go downstairs.

1125
01:20:44,764 --> 01:20:48,207
[SPEAKER_17]: and say, okay, please guys, one last game.

1126
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan goes, no!

1127
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:52,950
[SPEAKER_17]: You knew we were going to be here.

1128
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:58,815
[SPEAKER_17]: How inconsiderate, you know?

1129
01:20:59,475 --> 01:21:01,657
[SPEAKER_17]: I come home, and I'm tired.

1130
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it his time of the month?

1131
01:21:03,799 --> 01:21:05,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it must have been.

1132
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:10,724
[SPEAKER_17]: We had the Oriental Boa.

1133
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:11,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1134
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:13,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1135
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:18,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, it's one thing, I admit I came home late, and that's one thing.

1136
01:21:19,393 --> 01:21:22,835
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have thought that they would have wrapped it up by then, or would have just wrapped it up.

1137
01:21:22,855 --> 01:21:28,998
[SPEAKER_16]: You came home late out of consideration for the party, because you didn't want to see no stinking Xboxes, because they're just giant paperweights.

1138
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:38,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead I come home, and there's five TVs in my living room, and three Xboxes hooked up, and they're playing some stupid mecha ball game.

1139
01:21:39,574 --> 01:21:40,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Mecha Balls?

1140
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:45,142
[SPEAKER_17]: No, like, you go to, like, the one, like, Capture the Five, you have a ball, and you have to kick the ball across.

1141
01:21:45,162 --> 01:21:45,963
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really stupid.

1142
01:21:47,409 --> 01:21:49,069
[SPEAKER_16]: They were playing with balls all night, basically.

1143
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:50,210
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was fucking loud.

1144
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:52,410
[SPEAKER_16]: You had a bunch of men in your living room playing with balls.

1145
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:52,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1146
01:21:53,991 --> 01:21:54,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Just checking.

1147
01:21:55,751 --> 01:22:00,652
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I go upstairs and decide to make my icons, and I made, like, two Draco Malfoy ones.

1148
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:02,273
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, this sucks.

1149
01:22:03,093 --> 01:22:09,515
[SPEAKER_17]: So, this is what, you know, I thought that maybe he was going to be considerate and, you know, have everybody go home.

1150
01:22:10,195 --> 01:22:11,235
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this is what I hear.

1151
01:22:11,855 --> 01:22:13,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, one more game.

1152
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:14,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck!

1153
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:17,348
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm upstairs going, go home!

1154
01:22:17,788 --> 01:22:18,309
[SPEAKER_17]: You heard me!

1155
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:22,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, it's just, go home, get out of my house, I want to go to bed.

1156
01:22:23,653 --> 01:22:28,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not have been able to go to bed with all of that bullshit going on.

1157
01:22:29,258 --> 01:22:30,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was fucking tired.

1158
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I had been up all for a while.

1159
01:22:33,801 --> 01:22:35,122
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to have your revenge.

1160
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:36,904
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to have people over.

1161
01:22:36,944 --> 01:22:38,625
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to have people over for a gem marathon.

1162
01:22:38,665 --> 01:22:38,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1163
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,601
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'll just have another good money party at the apartment.

1164
01:22:49,101 --> 01:22:50,182
[SPEAKER_17]: How's that?

1165
01:22:51,562 --> 01:22:54,663
[SPEAKER_17]: The last one we had, we had, what, 20 people showed up?

1166
01:22:54,723 --> 01:22:55,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1167
01:22:55,484 --> 01:22:56,424
[SPEAKER_17]: In my living room!

1168
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:05,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Which, you know, the living room, you know, it's probably, it's a two-bedroom, no, you only have really a one, no, you have a two-bedroom apartment.

1169
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:07,909
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a two-bedroom, but it's a two-story apartment.

1170
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:09,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Sort of like a townhouse, but not quite.

1171
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:15,992
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, you know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but it really pissed me off.

1172
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:18,943
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like mad at me for being mad at him.

1173
01:23:18,983 --> 01:23:20,384
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, huh?

1174
01:23:21,865 --> 01:23:22,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me?

1175
01:23:22,885 --> 01:23:26,828
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I've gotten it out of my system now.

1176
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:30,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I want the whole world to know my displeasure.

1177
01:23:30,891 --> 01:23:33,193
[SPEAKER_17]: I want all the Xbox balls to die.

1178
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:37,115
[SPEAKER_16]: A big thank you to Xbox for ruining Jamie's life.

1179
01:23:37,335 --> 01:23:39,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, fuck you, Gates.

1180
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:40,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope you die.

1181
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:56,181
[SPEAKER_17]: May your brakes fail on the freeway and you go off of a cliff and land in a gigantic tank of sulfuric acid and dissolve slowly for hours until you finally die.

1182
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I hope your soul doesn't go to hell or doesn't go to heaven.

1183
01:24:00,504 --> 01:24:02,806
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope you're stuck in purgatory where you're bored forever.

1184
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:05,590
[SPEAKER_16]: My, are you done ranting?

1185
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:06,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you finished?

1186
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:07,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.

1187
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:08,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, world!

1188
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,932
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my segment, hello.

01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:20,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny, you just had to, like, reset the little, uh, FU song, like, three times by now.

1192
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:21,598
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can keep ranting.

[SPEAKER_17]: This is just... Okay, I'm being seemed about it.

1201
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,601
[SPEAKER_17]: I've made several noises of displeasure.

1202
01:24:42,721 --> 01:24:48,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, breathe in, breathe out, do some yoga, drink some boba, feel better.

[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, next!

01:24:54,409 --> 01:24:56,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, moving along.

1207
01:24:57,191 --> 01:24:57,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki!

1208
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:03,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, how can you possibly follow up that porn story?

1209
01:25:03,315 --> 01:25:03,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1210
01:25:05,357 --> 01:25:05,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh!

1211
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:08,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1212
01:25:09,339 --> 01:25:13,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have to give a big FU to my cold, which is now gone, thank God.

1213
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:18,502
[SPEAKER_15]: But it lasted too long, and it was annoying, so thank God it's gone.

1214
01:25:19,263 --> 01:25:27,626
[SPEAKER_15]: A big FU to the putters at Golf Land, because they keep chipping my shots.

1215
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:30,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time I hit the ball, it goes flying up in the air.

1216
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:34,497
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to add to that because they're like made crooked.

1217
01:25:35,357 --> 01:25:36,318
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear to God they are.

1218
01:25:36,358 --> 01:25:41,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I've looked at all of them when I worked there and if you actually hold the putter up and look at it, the faces are crooked.

1219
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:43,242
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't punch straight with those things.

1220
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:45,103
[SPEAKER_14]: They're made to fuck with you like that.

1221
01:25:45,844 --> 01:25:48,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, see, they make the putters just like they make all of the clubs.

1222
01:25:48,965 --> 01:25:52,647
[SPEAKER_14]: See, they go straight and then they turn so you can hit the ball.

1223
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:56,290
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that you meant the shafts are crooked.

1224
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,251
[SPEAKER_14]: No one likes a crooked shaft.

1225
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:01,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, how's it hanging?

1226
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:03,732
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bent right now.

1227
01:26:03,912 --> 01:26:04,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Crooked.

1228
01:26:05,153 --> 01:26:06,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Small shrivels and two left.

1229
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a real, like, disorder.

1230
01:26:09,317 --> 01:26:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And a crooked shaft.

1231
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, um, another FD goes to, uh...

1232
01:26:19,327 --> 01:26:20,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I finish?

1233
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:21,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I finish?

1234
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:22,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you!

1235
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:23,330
[SPEAKER_17]: No, play my music!

1236
01:26:24,571 --> 01:26:34,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, um, another FU goes to Folsom Lake Bowl for being one of the most ghetto bowling alley, actually it's the only bowling alley in Folsom, but it's very ghetto.

1237
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:36,458
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact they have these things that are called

1238
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:37,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Little Homies.

1239
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:41,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So I bought one, it's a stupid little thing that comes in a bottle.

1240
01:26:41,519 --> 01:26:43,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, dude, the Homies dolls, I know what you're talking about.

1241
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:43,900
[SPEAKER_15]: They're cool.

1242
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:55,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I took one of those, and I took it to Golfland, and I wanted the homie to go down the rapids, because, you know, that's what the homie's gonna do when the ball is go down the fucking rapids.

1243
01:26:55,363 --> 01:27:02,185
[SPEAKER_15]: So I threw him up in the fountain, and the fucking homie got stuck in the middle of the fountain, and the goddamn thing couldn't get it back, and my homie's gone!

1244
01:27:03,038 --> 01:27:07,269
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, NFB to the fountain that stole my homie And uh, let's see

1245
01:27:13,129 --> 01:27:23,777
[SPEAKER_15]: And on top of that, that would be the price for making me spend $200 there for putting stuff very cheap in a... They had 40-speed CD burners for $19 there.

1246
01:27:24,258 --> 01:27:25,158
[SPEAKER_15]: How awesome is that?

1247
01:27:25,178 --> 01:27:26,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean... It's a good brand.

1248
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1249
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, verbatim.

1250
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:29,802
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty decent.

1251
01:27:30,142 --> 01:27:33,185
[SPEAKER_15]: But I ended up buying a $129 one because of Yamaha.

1252
01:27:33,265 --> 01:27:37,588
[SPEAKER_15]: And it burns these really cool disc tattoo things that you can't see on normal discs.

1253
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:41,071
[SPEAKER_15]: They tell you that in the manual, not on the outside of the box.

1254
01:27:41,676 --> 01:27:42,437
[SPEAKER_15]: That kind of sucks.

1255
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:46,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, FD to me for buying two Saturns and Chords for one.

1256
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:53,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I bought one from Denios from this chick that couldn't speak English, but it was $10, so I was like, okay.

1257
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:59,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this other one was like $75 and came with games and Chords and shit, so I bought that and it was awesome.

1258
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:04,173
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, FD to that stupid chick who couldn't speak English because she's learning to speak English.

1259
01:28:04,213 --> 01:28:06,435
[SPEAKER_15]: She lives in the freaking United States!

1260
01:28:06,535 --> 01:28:07,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Speak English, dammit!

1261
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:10,235

[SPEAKER_15]: Aside from that, FD to my mom for making me listen to this stupid, like, spa music tape on the way down to Denial's.

1265
01:28:23,402 --> 01:28:31,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this guy, he took a cover... I mean, he was covering, like, Fur Elise in, um... He called it Imagine, but I don't think he said it.

1266
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:33,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was so important.

1267
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:34,529
[SPEAKER_15]: It was so masculine.

1268
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:40,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I have some really weak FUs this week.

1269
01:28:41,248 --> 01:28:43,214
[SPEAKER_15]: FU for me not being a good FU.

[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and F you to my fucking co-worker of mine, Linda.

1273
01:28:52,360 --> 01:29:00,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Freaking keeps telling me to get back to work and stop browsing the internet when I have the highest phone time out of the company.

1274
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:06,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I took like 400 calls in one day and shit, which is pretty huge.

1275
01:29:06,371 --> 01:29:10,013
[SPEAKER_15]: And she just has the nerve to start bitching at me about being on the phone.

1276
01:29:10,033 --> 01:29:13,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Then she goes back and starts talking with the other girl who's not on the phone.

1277
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:19,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Talking about, like, her boyfriend or some guy that she thought was cute and had a nice ass and all that shit.

1278
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, after her and that's it.

1279
01:29:20,241 --> 01:29:20,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1280
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:21,702
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fucked up.

01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:25,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a couple FUs this week, believe it or not.

01:29:38,945 --> 01:29:39,485

01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:47,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, my first F you goes to, um, anybody I've ever gone out clubbing with before, because I've always had to drive in the past.

1285
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:52,354
[SPEAKER_16]: But this week, I got to be a participant in the drinking festivities when I went out to the bar.

1286
01:29:52,895 --> 01:29:59,760
[SPEAKER_16]: I got so drunk off my ass, I had to be carried out of the bar, and I had so much fun, that I've just been missing out all these years.

1287
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:03,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, F people who always make me be the designated driver.

01:30:08,926 --> 01:30:11,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody knows your collar is covered.

1291
01:30:11,307 --> 01:30:12,908
[SPEAKER_17]: They're probably trying to do you a favor.

1292
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:14,949
[SPEAKER_16]: F you, lady.

1293

01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:28,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, what's your face in there?

1298
01:30:29,296 --> 01:30:32,498
[SPEAKER_16]: A big F you to my 2DX controller.

01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,058
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a piece of shit and I hate you.

1300
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:34,899
[SPEAKER_17]: I second that.

[SPEAKER_16]: A big F you to the song DXY.

[SPEAKER_16]: F you to whoever called me during the show.

01:30:56,601 --> 01:31:00,283
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to anyone that doesn't live in Sacramento because you live in a better place, I'm sure.

1309
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:02,744
[SPEAKER_16]: No, except for Davis.

1310
01:31:02,764 --> 01:31:03,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Davis sucks.

1311
01:31:03,605 --> 01:31:04,405
[SPEAKER_16]: And Chico sucks too.

1312
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:05,346
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Republican Davis.

1313
01:31:06,744 --> 01:31:08,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Gwen lives in Naples, Florida.

1314
01:31:10,385 --> 01:31:11,485
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right, I'm sorry.

1315
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:15,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And Florida is also exempt from that because you have twins.

1316
01:31:15,305 --> 01:31:22,947
[SPEAKER_15]: They also messed up the... They still messed up the fucking ballot counts down there in Florida for like the governor race.

1317
01:31:23,727 --> 01:31:26,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that's a dump of fucking chads!

1318
01:31:27,288 --> 01:31:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a chad?

1319
01:31:28,528 --> 01:31:31,088
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a poop in a freaking home for?

1320
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:33,669
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, they're so stupid.

1321
01:31:34,509 --> 01:31:35,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're stupid.

1322
01:31:36,448 --> 01:31:38,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid old people that live in Florida.

1323
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:39,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Old people suck.

1324
01:31:39,491 --> 01:31:41,032
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be the old people.

1325
01:31:41,052 --> 01:31:42,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you die?

1326
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:43,315
[SPEAKER_15]: No one wants you around.

1327
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:44,676
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why they're sending you to Florida.

1328
01:31:44,756 --> 01:31:45,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Just go die.

1329
01:31:46,157 --> 01:31:46,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Die.

1330
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:47,759
[SPEAKER_15]: No one misses you.

1331
01:31:47,979 --> 01:31:48,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Die.

1332
01:31:48,499 --> 01:31:50,021
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll make room for more resorts.

1333
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:52,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Florida is like the gateway to hell.

1334
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:55,626
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like where they keep all the old people and wait to die.

1335
01:31:56,047 --> 01:31:57,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, hell is really close to there.

1336
01:31:57,648 --> 01:31:58,909
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a small little island.

1337
01:31:58,929 --> 01:32:01,732
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it's crazy hot and humid every day.

1338
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:09,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and F you to Spazzy, who's in the chat room right now, because he got to go see Hot People last night, and I didn't, and I'm jealous.

1339
01:32:09,848 --> 01:32:10,368
[SPEAKER_16]: So F you.

1340
01:32:11,128 --> 01:32:11,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1341
01:32:11,769 --> 01:32:13,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it my turn now?

1342
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:15,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's your turn, Dave.

1343
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,553
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I get it.

1344
01:32:18,593 --> 01:32:19,133
[SPEAKER_14]: My song.

1345
01:32:20,094 --> 01:32:21,075
[SPEAKER_14]: My song's gay.

1346
01:32:21,755 --> 01:32:22,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally.

1347
01:32:23,296 --> 01:32:23,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1348
01:32:24,377 --> 01:32:28,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really have that many F yous, but many of them are like Rob's.

1349
01:32:29,013 --> 01:32:32,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, first, F you to my parents for not wanting to take me out here.

1350
01:32:33,595 --> 01:32:38,077
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to, uh, I actually have to stop that for a minute because I have to thank Dave's parents for the taquitos.

1351
01:32:38,897 --> 01:32:39,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

1352
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,038
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

1353
01:32:41,358 --> 01:32:41,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Tacos!

1354
01:32:42,039 --> 01:32:42,779
[SPEAKER_16]: The taquitos.

1355
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:43,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1356
01:32:44,019 --> 01:32:46,320
[SPEAKER_14]: That was horrible.

1357
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:46,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Die.

1358
01:32:48,661 --> 01:32:49,982
[SPEAKER_14]: The taquitos.

1359
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:50,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1360
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:51,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1361
01:32:51,823 --> 01:32:52,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1362
01:32:52,659 --> 01:32:58,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck them for not wanting to take me out here and for making me read 100 pages of a shitty-ass book today so I could cum.

1363
01:32:59,244 --> 01:33:02,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Because a yellow raft in blue water is crap.

1364
01:33:03,047 --> 01:33:03,908
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate reading.

1365
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:15,658
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, also I fuck you's to many 2DX songs which I can't pass, such as StarMind for the fucking last ten, like, two seconds of it.

1366
01:33:16,078 --> 01:33:22,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it has, like, 20 notes at once, and I always get down to 58% or whatever it is when you miss all of them.

1367
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:23,443
[SPEAKER_14]: So fuck that.

1368
01:33:24,623 --> 01:33:26,844
[SPEAKER_14]: And fuck all the seven stars that I can't pass.

1369
01:33:27,404 --> 01:33:27,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1370
01:33:28,764 --> 01:33:29,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's it.

1371
01:33:29,524 --> 01:33:29,864
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1372
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:30,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Raining Men.

1373
01:33:31,265 --> 01:33:31,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck this song.

1374
01:33:32,105 --> 01:33:32,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wait, no.

1375
01:33:32,765 --> 01:33:34,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And fuck Twen because he said that he wanted to be fucked.

1376
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,286
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he said that he wanted to be... Whatever makes you happy.

1377
01:33:38,386 --> 01:33:40,186
[SPEAKER_14]: He said that he wanted to be everyone's fuck you.

1378
01:33:40,446 --> 01:33:41,667
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

1379
01:33:42,347 --> 01:33:46,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're... And now we're gonna go to Black Labs FUs.

1380
01:33:47,008 --> 01:33:48,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And this song is meant to be ironic.

1381
01:33:51,357 --> 01:33:52,038
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the cat song.

1382
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:53,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1383
01:33:53,519 --> 01:33:57,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, first, fuck this song.

1384
01:33:58,225 --> 01:33:59,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's about cats.

1385
01:34:01,148 --> 01:34:03,731
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have rather heard Who Let the Dogs Out than this.

1386
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:05,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I can erase that, don't tempt me.

1387
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:06,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, like it.

1388
01:34:08,015 --> 01:34:08,215
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1389
01:34:09,817 --> 01:34:10,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let's see.

1390
01:34:10,498 --> 01:34:11,179
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all...

1391
01:34:12,242 --> 01:34:14,503
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get to do my FUs of last week, so fuck that.

1392
01:34:14,843 --> 01:34:16,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I was not around.

1393
01:34:17,023 --> 01:34:19,604
[SPEAKER_16]: I was at home most of the weekend.

1394
01:34:19,744 --> 01:34:23,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you had a birthday or something that you think is more important.

1395
01:34:23,765 --> 01:34:24,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shut up, Rob.

1396
01:34:25,405 --> 01:34:32,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, it happened to be my 18th birthday, which was actually this past Wednesday, but I went home the weekend before, which made me mishap.

1397
01:34:33,747 --> 01:34:36,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And I went paintballing, which was cool, but we got rained out.

1398
01:34:37,884 --> 01:34:47,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I found out that he found my live journal and read through every single entry.

1399
01:35:09,465 --> 01:35:12,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And that kind of pissed me off, really.

1400
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:16,809
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on the internet.

1401
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,090
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not private.

1402
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:22,252
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but the fact is that... But there's more to it.

1403
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:30,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, see, it's kind of a longer story here, but what he did was he actually first...

1404
01:35:31,247 --> 01:35:59,435
[SPEAKER_16]: saw it on my computer and then went and snooped through it then he gave it the addresses to the rest of the people in the suite that I live in and they all read it and now they're they get all they're like all freaked out now and then they're they actually one of them actually told me that they thought they kind of had the consensus that I was going to go snap and fucking kill them because of all the ranting I do in my live journal so say yes ha ha

1405
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:09,545
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that they actually went through and started using it against me really irked me.

1406
01:36:09,906 --> 01:36:20,072
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my roommate actually went and decided to instant message a couple of my friends from my friends list asking about the stuff in there.

1407
01:36:20,173 --> 01:36:23,495
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was like, okay, that's just getting a bit too fucking nosy.

1408
01:36:24,636 --> 01:36:26,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And that really pissed me off.

1409
01:36:27,117 --> 01:36:30,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the first time anyone's ever said irk on this show.

1410
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,681
[SPEAKER_16]: I beg to differ.

1411
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:34,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe I would have said that word in the past.

1412
01:36:34,282 --> 01:36:34,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on.

1413
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:35,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that word.

1414
01:36:35,783 --> 01:36:36,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Ert.

1415
01:36:36,484 --> 01:36:37,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Like Erkel.

1416
01:36:38,245 --> 01:36:39,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Irina said it before.

1417
01:36:39,826 --> 01:36:40,947
[SPEAKER_16]: I will have to check the archives.

1418
01:36:41,448 --> 01:36:42,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, Black Lapis is continuing.

1419
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:42,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1420
01:36:43,009 --> 01:36:46,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to continue.

1421
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

1422
01:36:48,072 --> 01:36:54,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck the dining halls at Davis because they serve the same food over and over again and I'm sick of it already.

1423
01:36:55,798 --> 01:37:00,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And next time I eat there, I swear I'm going to puke all over the table there.

1424
01:37:02,637 --> 01:37:02,877
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1425
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:03,798
[SPEAKER_16]: No, let him finish.

1426
01:37:04,058 --> 01:37:05,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me finish, damn it!

1427
01:37:05,298 --> 01:37:07,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just... I'm just... You didn't let him move.

1428
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:08,680
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1429
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Let Twen move.

1430
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:13,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1431
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:16,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1432
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:21,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck the rain for messing up this wheel on my bike so that now my brakes don't work.

1433
01:37:22,345 --> 01:37:23,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to get those fixed now.

1434
01:37:24,186 --> 01:37:24,866
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, let's see.

1435
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:25,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1436
01:37:25,246 --> 01:37:25,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1437
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:32,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, uh, yeah, this one's kinda recent here.

1438
01:37:33,407 --> 01:37:35,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck Rob for getting me addicted to 2DX.

1439
01:37:36,107 --> 01:37:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1440
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:45,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent, like, when I came over here last night and, like, let's see, we got here sometime, like, what was it, like, 8 o'clock or something?

1441
01:37:45,629 --> 01:37:46,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, about then.

1442
01:37:46,889 --> 01:37:54,171
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, I started playing 2DX, and I was like, okay, this is cool, and the next thing I know, I'm still playing, and it's 9 o'clock in the morning!

1443
01:37:55,842 --> 01:38:02,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I played for probably 10 or 11 straight hours before I decided, oh shit, I think I need to get some sleep.

1444
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:06,170
[SPEAKER_16]: So I slept for two hours, and then went and played some more.

1445
01:38:08,272 --> 01:38:10,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And I still want to go back and play more now.

1446
01:38:11,474 --> 01:38:14,436
[SPEAKER_16]: And now I have to go home and have 2DX and I'm going to cry.

1447
01:38:15,337 --> 01:38:15,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1448
01:38:17,038 --> 01:38:19,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, this song needs to be in DDR extreme.

1449
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:20,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it will be.

1450
01:38:21,282 --> 01:38:24,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other FUs in the room before I get... Alright, Dave has another one.

1451
01:38:24,704 --> 01:38:25,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Dave, yes.

1452
01:38:26,243 --> 01:38:26,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait.

1453
01:38:27,246 --> 01:38:27,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh shit.

1454
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:28,990
[SPEAKER_16]: I had it!

1455
01:38:29,812 --> 01:38:30,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck.

1456
01:38:31,056 --> 01:38:31,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait.

1457
01:38:31,838 --> 01:38:32,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, Loki has it.

1458
01:38:37,348 --> 01:38:57,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, real quick, FU2, Old Navy, that place is Satan, it's just, it's evil, I hate the commercials, I hate the old stars that get on there for the stupid commercials, I wish they'd all go to hell, and then the whole place, when you walk in there, it's just like one big giant Old Navy commercial, it's like...

1459
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,774
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like so annoying!

1460
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:00,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate them!

1461
01:39:00,914 --> 01:39:05,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only reason I went through to buy clothes was because I had a fucking gift certificate for $50.

1462
01:39:06,017 --> 01:39:10,240
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thought I spent all the money on the gift certificate, because I was trying to get out of there as quick as possible.

1463
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I got there.

1464
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you have $6 left in your card!

1465
01:39:13,001 --> 01:39:13,501
DAMMIT!

1466
01:39:14,302 --> 01:39:15,603
[SPEAKER_15]: NOOOOOO!

1467
01:39:16,243 --> 01:39:17,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had to go back there and shop more.

1468
01:39:21,406 --> 01:39:24,248
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what, they're just gonna keep me there!

1469
01:39:24,928 --> 01:39:25,628
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1470
01:39:26,189 --> 01:39:26,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, that's it.

1471
01:39:30,427 --> 01:39:31,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it's chat room time.

1472
01:39:31,868 --> 01:39:34,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go to the chat room FUs.

1473
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:36,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

1474
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:38,130
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to run through these as fast as I can.

1475
01:39:55,106 --> 01:39:57,347
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the longest FUs I've ever, but that's alright.

1476
01:39:58,267 --> 01:40:03,009
[SPEAKER_16]: JB says, um, F you to Winamp because it skips too much.

1477
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:17,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And DSCS says, um, F me, Sky, for making him work, fuck being sick for almost two weeks, fuck the doctors for scaring him about possibly having tuberculosis, and fuck homework.

1478
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:18,854

[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and more strategy.

1578
01:45:41,587 --> 01:45:43,989

1579
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:47,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but like the cards cost like $4 a booster pack.

1580
01:45:47,131 --> 01:45:48,673
[SPEAKER_14]: That's some ridiculous amount of money.

1581

1628
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:34,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we're going to take another break.

1629
01:47:34,874 --> 01:47:37,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Coming from the room full of the most cracker-ass people.

1630
01:47:39,819 --> 01:47:40,619
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to crack us.

1631
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:47,540
[SPEAKER_16]: On that note, we're going to take a quick break and we will come back.

1632
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,564
[SPEAKER_16]: And at that point, we're going to do a little segment we call List List.

1633
01:47:53,524 --> 01:47:56,567
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a five-person list list tonight, so it should be exciting.

1634
01:47:57,227 --> 01:47:59,849
[SPEAKER_16]: The topic is very interesting.

1635
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:00,690
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

1636
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:03,492
[SPEAKER_16]: So, here we go.

1637
01:48:03,532 --> 01:48:04,493
[SPEAKER_16]: We're taking another quick break.

1638
01:48:04,553 --> 01:48:05,514
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back in a little bit.

1639
01:48:05,814 --> 01:48:06,375
[SPEAKER_16]: See ya.

1640
01:49:17,729 --> 01:49:18,353
Thanks for watching!

1641
01:52:14,162 --> 01:52:14,804
Thanks for watching!

1642
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:16,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1643
01:53:32,182 --> 01:53:34,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait until I find the real tomorrow.

1644
01:53:34,423 --> 01:53:36,584
[SPEAKER_08]: SAKEDOWN Music that sounds like an explosion.

1645
01:53:36,664 --> 01:53:37,524
[SPEAKER_08]: A rising tension.

1646
01:53:37,584 --> 01:53:38,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't go far.

1647
01:53:38,184 --> 01:53:39,765
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an engine development.

1648
01:53:39,825 --> 01:53:40,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll jump on this wind.

1649
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:41,926
[SPEAKER_08]: All the light and sadness.

1650
01:53:42,046 --> 01:53:42,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll throw them all away.

1651
01:53:42,826 --> 01:53:45,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the kind of person who likes boring sad things.

1652
01:54:06,039 --> 01:54:07,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1653
01:54:33,715 --> 01:54:39,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge being on a music and more show?

1654
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:46,806
[SPEAKER_00]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1655
01:54:47,126 --> 01:54:49,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unearthly.

1656
01:54:49,348 --> 01:54:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1657
01:54:55,032 --> 01:54:55,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1658
01:54:55,953 --> 01:54:57,654
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1659
01:54:57,674 --> 01:54:58,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We're back.

1660
01:54:58,535 --> 01:55:00,557
[SPEAKER_17]: No one would dance with that guy even if he did ask.

1661
01:55:01,057 --> 01:55:03,319
[SPEAKER_16]: The only decent DDR film ever made, by the way.

1662
01:55:05,557 --> 01:55:06,578
[SPEAKER_17]: That was fucking hilarious.

1663
01:55:06,798 --> 01:55:08,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry, Loki disagrees.

1664
01:55:08,261 --> 01:55:10,344
[SPEAKER_16]: That was stupid.

1665
01:55:11,566 --> 01:55:12,747
[SPEAKER_16]: He disagrees it was decent.

1666
01:55:13,484 --> 01:55:14,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do our list list.

1667
01:55:44,144 --> 01:55:48,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people have a very big experience in their wrist action, so that should help for them.

1668
01:55:49,988 --> 01:55:54,631
[SPEAKER_16]: But... You know, hey, I know people that freestyle playing 2DX, namely me.

1669
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:55,251
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fun.

1670
01:55:57,248 --> 01:56:03,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, I think that, uh... So let's explain, because this is the season premiere and we have some new people listening.

1671
01:56:03,691 --> 01:56:05,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's explain what listless is.

1672
01:56:05,752 --> 01:56:08,453
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not list list, it's list less.

1673
01:56:09,374 --> 01:56:13,476
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, listless is the segment... Now they get it.

1674
01:56:13,896 --> 01:56:15,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I just talk funny, I'm sorry.

1675
01:56:16,557 --> 01:56:20,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Listless... Quirky!

1676
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:21,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

1677
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:26,983
[SPEAKER_16]: This segment of the show, we make the definitive list on some topic.

1678
01:56:27,023 --> 01:56:30,764
[SPEAKER_16]: And basically the way it works is that we're all going to name our top three.

1679
01:56:31,405 --> 01:56:38,028
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll have a list of 15 beverages that are great to play, or that are great to drink while playing DDR, 2DX, whatever.

1680
01:56:38,668 --> 01:56:42,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we'll all go around the room and everybody eliminates one thing from the list.

1681
01:56:42,991 --> 01:56:49,914
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the chat room will vote to decide the ultimate DDR beverage, Bimani beverage.

1682
01:56:50,935 --> 01:56:51,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

1683
01:56:53,641 --> 01:56:54,381
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how it works.

1684
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:58,262
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you ever saw the old VH1 show, The List, nothing to do with it.

1685
01:56:58,562 --> 01:56:59,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely nothing to do with that.

1686
01:56:59,823 --> 01:57:00,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing at all.

1687
01:57:01,463 --> 01:57:02,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so... Wait, wait.

1688
01:57:03,804 --> 01:57:05,824
[SPEAKER_14]: That show is the stupidest fucking show ever.

1689
01:57:06,104 --> 01:57:12,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, okay, they let the audience pick their favorite that gets put on the list, but the audience already picked their favorite.

1690
01:57:13,286 --> 01:57:14,986
[SPEAKER_16]: So, why wouldn't they just pick it again?

1691
01:57:15,066 --> 01:57:19,748
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason why that show sucked is that Lauryn Hill somehow ended up on every single list they ever did.

1692
01:57:20,068 --> 01:57:24,089
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be Best Male Artist of the 80s, and Lauryn Hill was number one.

1693
01:57:24,209 --> 01:57:24,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time.

1694
01:57:25,329 --> 01:57:25,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time.

1695
01:57:26,969 --> 01:57:28,690
[SPEAKER_16]: She did one good album.

1696
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:29,650
[SPEAKER_16]: One good album.

1697
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:32,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, unless you count the Fugees, but you don't, because that wasn't a solo thing.

1698
01:57:33,031 --> 01:57:34,051
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, that's a whole other rant.

1699
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:35,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go for our list list.

1700
01:57:35,412 --> 01:57:37,512
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll do an F you to Lauryn Hill fans next week.

1701
01:57:38,232 --> 01:57:40,613
[SPEAKER_17]: So, because I'm special, I'll start.

1702
01:57:42,143 --> 01:57:45,124
[SPEAKER_17]: My number three is Oxygenated Water.

1703
01:57:45,884 --> 01:57:47,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Oxygenated Water.

1704
01:57:47,384 --> 01:57:52,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember the brand, but I bought Oxygenated Water one time, and I felt like absolutely freaking refreshed after it.

1705
01:57:52,886 --> 01:57:53,606
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really cool.

1706
01:57:53,626 --> 01:57:59,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you just do the same thing as by shaking up a bottle of water?

1707
01:57:59,188 --> 01:58:02,429
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that's what's Oxygenated.

1708
01:58:02,469 --> 01:58:04,609
[SPEAKER_17]: This is like super Oxygenated Water.

1709
01:58:04,649 --> 01:58:05,029
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1710
01:58:05,269 --> 01:58:07,170
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was kind of cool, and I felt a little lightheaded.

1711
01:58:08,210 --> 01:58:10,191
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, yeah.

1712
01:58:10,211 --> 01:58:10,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Next.

1713
01:58:11,859 --> 01:58:15,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your number three choice for best beverage for Bologna.

1714
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:16,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I suddenly really drink one thing.

1715
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:21,602
[SPEAKER_15]: The rest are just going to be what I would be drinking if I wasn't drinking one thing.

1716
01:58:22,042 --> 01:58:23,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to say a 40-ounce malt liquor.

1717
01:58:29,324 --> 01:58:30,124
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the winner.

1718
01:58:30,424 --> 01:58:31,224
[SPEAKER_14]: No need to add anything.

1719
01:58:31,264 --> 01:58:33,905
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, 40-ounce malt liquor.

1720
01:58:34,445 --> 01:58:35,725
[SPEAKER_17]: A cult 45.

1721
01:58:35,905 --> 01:58:38,346
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have Billy Dee Williams come out and play DDR.

1722
01:58:40,439 --> 01:58:43,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, now... Dave, you're number three, Vic.

1723
01:58:43,601 --> 01:58:44,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1724
01:58:45,102 --> 01:58:53,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I don't really drink too many varieties of drinks, or soft drinks, or power drinks, or, you know, sports drinks, or whatever.

1725
01:58:54,368 --> 01:59:04,915
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I know that one drink that gets me hyper as fuck, so I can play Keto and get all the way to Max X, is Jolt, because that gets me so, like... Jolt!

1726
01:59:05,636 --> 01:59:06,977
[SPEAKER_17]: All the sugar and twice the caffeine.

1727
01:59:07,717 --> 01:59:09,038
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what got me through college, by the way.

1728
01:59:09,659 --> 01:59:09,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1729
01:59:11,656 --> 01:59:12,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Jolt.

1730
01:59:12,196 --> 01:59:16,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Black Lab, your number three choice for best Pomani beverage.

1731
01:59:16,459 --> 01:59:16,959
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty here.

1732
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:24,704
[SPEAKER_16]: As you may not know, the only DDR machine in Davis is in the Tapioca Express.

1733
01:59:24,844 --> 01:59:25,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

1734
01:59:25,584 --> 01:59:34,630
[SPEAKER_16]: So, appropriately enough, the drink that I usually get every time I go in there would be a strawberry snow bubble from the Tapioca Express.

1735
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:36,111
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of like a Slurpee.

1736
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:38,732
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're specifically stating a strawberry snow bubble?

1737
01:59:38,932 --> 01:59:39,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I am.

1738
01:59:39,493 --> 01:59:39,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1739
01:59:39,613 --> 01:59:39,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1740
01:59:40,453 --> 01:59:41,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Just wanted to double check.

1741
01:59:41,935 --> 01:59:43,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, well, yeah.

1742
01:59:43,736 --> 01:59:45,017
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, it'll get wiped out pretty easy.

1743
01:59:45,057 --> 01:59:58,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I just need something to fill space, but... Yeah, it was... It's like, kind of like a Slurpee, except it's like, they use like a special syrup in it, and it's kind of like they use milk in it too, so it's like milky, and it's like really, really, really, really good.

1744
01:59:59,551 --> 02:00:02,093
[SPEAKER_16]: And plus it's really good when you have tapioca in it too.

1745
02:00:02,894 --> 02:00:03,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1746
02:00:04,015 --> 02:00:06,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Strawberry Snowbubble from Black Lab.

1747
02:00:06,498 --> 02:00:15,950
[SPEAKER_16]: My number three pick for best Vimani beverage, and if you've ever been to one of my infamous house parties, you'll know why I'm naming this one.

1748
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:18,332
[SPEAKER_16]: My number three pick is Goldschlager.

1749
02:00:22,317 --> 02:00:22,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1750
02:00:23,496 --> 02:00:28,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Instant Fun, Just Add Goldschlager is my number three pick.

1751
02:00:28,418 --> 02:00:30,239
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I have to say.

1752
02:00:30,299 --> 02:00:34,940
[SPEAKER_16]: For all the kiddies, it basically tastes like drinking cough syrup, but it fucks you right up.

1753
02:00:35,361 --> 02:00:37,121
[SPEAKER_16]: It just fucks you right up.

1754
02:00:37,321 --> 02:00:38,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Here I am trying to be healthy.

1755
02:00:38,662 --> 02:00:41,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, my number two pick is Berry Propel.

1756
02:00:42,123 --> 02:00:42,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Berry Propel.

1757
02:00:42,984 --> 02:00:47,946
[SPEAKER_17]: And the thing is, I usually have this with me more often than my number one choice because my number one choice is harder to find.

1758
02:00:48,546 --> 02:00:48,946
[SPEAKER_17]: However...

1759
02:00:50,518 --> 02:00:57,100
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a bottle of Berry Propel freaking sitting in Rob's refrigerator because I bought it, but I had to have my vanilla Coke first.

1760
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,581
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so Berry Propel is Jamie's number two drink.

1761
02:01:02,461 --> 02:01:04,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your number two pick for best banani beverage.

1762
02:01:06,362 --> 02:01:16,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, as I stated before, I don't really have anything other than my number one pick, so I'm going to have to go with imported Mexican tap water.

1763
02:01:21,534 --> 02:01:23,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, imported Mexican what?

1764
02:01:23,535 --> 02:01:24,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Tequila?

1765
02:01:24,716 --> 02:01:26,417
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, tap water?

1766
02:01:26,517 --> 02:01:26,577
Ew!

1767
02:01:28,098 --> 02:01:28,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Yuck!

1768
02:01:29,219 --> 02:01:31,941
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not with the cayenne pepper to go with it, it'd be for pooping.

1769
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:34,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Imported Mexican tap water.

1770
02:01:35,183 --> 02:01:45,050
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, little known fact for people who don't have the, you know, years of natural healing experience that I do, if you're going to go to Mexico and drink the water...

1771
02:01:45,859 --> 02:01:49,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Better eat cayenne pepper before you do, because it will keep you from shitting all over everything.

1772
02:01:52,622 --> 02:01:52,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1773
02:01:53,143 --> 02:01:53,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Jesus.

1774
02:01:54,423 --> 02:01:54,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1775
02:01:55,764 --> 02:01:56,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, where are we?

1776
02:01:56,324 --> 02:01:57,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave, yes, your number two choice.

1777
02:01:57,785 --> 02:02:00,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm not sure I can beat imported Mexican tap water.

1778
02:02:00,947 --> 02:02:05,489
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, my number two choice is, uh, Vanilla Coke Icy.

1779
02:02:05,869 --> 02:02:07,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Because those things are hella good.

1780
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,291
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're really, really sweet.

1781
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:11,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, twice as sweet as a normal Vanilla Coke.

1782
02:02:11,452 --> 02:02:12,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanilla Coke Icy.

1783
02:02:12,612 --> 02:02:13,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Good choice.

1784
02:02:13,193 --> 02:02:13,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Good choice.

1785
02:02:14,724 --> 02:02:16,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Quackwab, you're number two pick, please.

1786
02:02:17,565 --> 02:02:22,587
[SPEAKER_16]: This one of mine is just like a recently discovered thing, I just tried it out once, it was like, oh, this is hella good!

1787
02:02:23,087 --> 02:02:30,410
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, uh, it's made by Snapple, it's the Atomic Elements drink, which is Jack Apple flavor.

1788
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:41,553
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got caffeine and ginseng and a bunch of other good shit that keeps me awake and hella hyper, and that's one of the things that I had last night to help contribute to my 2D expansion.

1789
02:02:43,454 --> 02:02:43,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice.

1790
02:02:44,655 --> 02:02:45,536
[SPEAKER_16]: My number two pick?

1791
02:02:47,578 --> 02:02:50,101
[SPEAKER_16]: My number two pick was Red Bull and Malibu.

1792
02:02:51,182 --> 02:02:55,566
[SPEAKER_16]: However, at the risk of sounding like a lush, I'm just going to cut that to Red Bull.

1793
02:02:57,087 --> 02:02:58,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the drink that looks like urine.

1794
02:02:59,089 --> 02:03:00,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the drink that smells like pussy.

1795
02:03:02,223 --> 02:03:03,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Or so I've heard.

1796
02:03:03,344 --> 02:03:04,684
[SPEAKER_17]: It actually does look like urine.

1797
02:03:05,365 --> 02:03:06,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it does look like pee.

1798
02:03:06,705 --> 02:03:09,367
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, my favorite bar has it now where it comes out of the spray.

1799
02:03:09,647 --> 02:03:11,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, they don't even have to open up the cans anymore.

1800
02:03:11,188 --> 02:03:12,188
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just right in the tap.

1801
02:03:12,568 --> 02:03:14,509
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Pepsi, Sprite, Red Bull.

1802
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:15,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Fucking rules.

1803
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:18,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so now we're down to our number one picks.

1804
02:03:18,712 --> 02:03:21,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, your number one best Behmany beverage.

1805
02:03:22,406 --> 02:03:27,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I have often said that one of these days I'm actually going to own one of the vending machines for this beverage.

1806
02:03:28,552 --> 02:03:33,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I have ordered this stuff plenty of times and brought it in to our Viggo to play and drink and stuff.

1807
02:03:34,318 --> 02:03:37,261
[SPEAKER_17]: Pocari Sweat, the drink that actually does look like sweat.

1808
02:03:37,702 --> 02:03:39,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And it tastes much better than Gatorade.

1809
02:03:40,885 --> 02:03:41,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Pocari Sweat.

1810
02:03:42,246 --> 02:03:42,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1811
02:03:42,587 --> 02:03:43,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1812
02:03:44,028 --> 02:03:44,829
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sweatalicious.

1813
02:03:45,902 --> 02:03:48,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Pokari Sweat is kind of an intimidating name to me, I don't know.

1814
02:03:50,663 --> 02:03:52,664
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how I feel about Pokari Sweat, but anyway.

1815
02:03:53,764 --> 02:03:55,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's move right along, shall we?

1816
02:03:55,405 --> 02:03:58,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your number one pick for best bemani beverage.

1817
02:03:59,026 --> 02:04:02,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I'm just gonna go with Surge, because I love that stuff, it's good.

1818
02:04:03,167 --> 02:04:03,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Surge!

1819
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:07,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Surge sounds like it should be with Slim Jim, I don't know, but anyway.

1820
02:04:08,989 --> 02:04:11,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so Surge, which they don't even make anymore, correct?

1821
02:04:12,233 --> 02:04:12,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Did they still make it?

1822
02:04:13,054 --> 02:04:13,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Did they?

1823
02:04:13,914 --> 02:04:14,655
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know where to get it.

1824
02:04:15,115 --> 02:04:15,335
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1825
02:04:16,176 --> 02:04:19,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave, your number one pick for best Baymadi beverage.

1826
02:04:19,338 --> 02:04:24,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe I was like, after I said Vanilla Coca-Icy, I completely forgot what I was going to say for this one, but I finally remembered.

1827
02:04:25,343 --> 02:04:26,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Hawaiian Punch.

1828
02:04:26,944 --> 02:04:31,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they sell that down at the shell for like 99 cents for a two liter.

1829
02:04:32,028 --> 02:04:36,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And I remember the days when it's raining and everyone runs over there and buys like ten of them.

1830
02:04:36,612 --> 02:04:39,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you all just take them back and put them in between the two DVR machines.

1831
02:04:40,322 --> 02:04:41,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?

1832
02:04:42,744 --> 02:04:43,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Punch.

1833
02:04:45,707 --> 02:04:46,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't punch!

1834
02:04:47,329 --> 02:04:50,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Blackwab, your number one choice, please, for Best Pay Money Beverage.

1835
02:04:51,593 --> 02:04:55,217
[SPEAKER_15]: As the people in the room can see, I have a hat on.

1836
02:04:55,497 --> 02:04:57,359
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the logo splattered all over it.

1837
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:03,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And for those of you that aren't in the room and can't see it, it happens to be Mountain Dew Code Red.

1838
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:06,241
[SPEAKER_16]: It is fucking addicting to me.

1839
02:05:06,961 --> 02:05:07,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I get it.

1840
02:05:07,802 --> 02:05:09,243
[SPEAKER_16]: I always get leaders of it.

1841
02:05:09,463 --> 02:05:09,923
[SPEAKER_16]: All the time.

1842
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:12,685
[SPEAKER_16]: I probably go through maybe... Well, let's see.

1843
02:05:12,705 --> 02:05:13,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, no.

1844
02:05:13,085 --> 02:05:16,227
[SPEAKER_15]: I have two cases of cans in my dorm room right now.

1845
02:05:17,247 --> 02:05:18,288
[SPEAKER_15]: One of which is in the fridge.

1846
02:05:18,968 --> 02:05:22,330
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have Mountain Dew Code Red stuff on my walls.

1847
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:25,032
[SPEAKER_17]: That shit tastes worse than Cherry Nightville.

1848
02:05:26,152 --> 02:05:26,793
[SPEAKER_15]: It does not.

1849
02:05:27,953 --> 02:05:28,053
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1850
02:05:31,977 --> 02:05:33,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Touch code red and die!

1851
02:05:33,642 --> 02:05:35,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, my number one pick.

1852
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:36,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Now...

1853
02:05:37,779 --> 02:05:45,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Those of you know, I know we have a lot of people from Vegas in the chat room, so I know you guys will agree with me on this one, because this is the best Bimani drink I've ever had.

1854
02:05:46,023 --> 02:05:47,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the most fun playing Bimani.

1855
02:05:47,544 --> 02:05:48,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's in Vegas?

1856
02:05:48,485 --> 02:05:50,065
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a few people from Vegas in the chat room.

1857
02:05:50,085 --> 02:05:50,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't, like, Eos?

1858
02:05:51,046 --> 02:05:52,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I believe they're from Vegas.

1859
02:05:52,627 --> 02:05:54,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And Maple also, right?

1860
02:05:54,228 --> 02:05:55,128
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Maple's in the Vegas.

1861
02:05:55,388 --> 02:05:55,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?

1862
02:05:56,088 --> 02:05:56,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, never mind.

1863
02:05:56,929 --> 02:05:58,730
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't know what you're talking about.

1864
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:00,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe VidPower's from Vegas.

1865
02:06:00,591 --> 02:06:02,052
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some other folks there.

1866
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:04,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, can I finish?

1867
02:06:04,841 --> 02:06:05,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I finish?

1868
02:06:05,402 --> 02:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1869
02:06:05,943 --> 02:06:08,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So those of you in Vegas know about the Hilton.

1870
02:06:09,267 --> 02:06:11,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Hilton's got this little place called the Star Trek Experience.

1871
02:06:11,591 --> 02:06:13,213
[SPEAKER_16]: And at that experience, they sell a drink.

1872
02:06:13,233 --> 02:06:13,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you bitch.

1873
02:06:14,375 --> 02:06:16,458
[SPEAKER_16]: The Warp Core Breach, ladies and gentlemen.

1874
02:06:16,478 --> 02:06:17,780
[SPEAKER_17]: I fucking love the Warp Core Breach.

1875
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:22,983
[SPEAKER_17]: I have done Drunken DDR on the Warp Core Breach and it is the shit.

1876
02:06:23,303 --> 02:06:24,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Warp Core Breach.

1877
02:06:24,604 --> 02:06:33,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven different kinds of Bacardi, Asobi, and Razzmatazz all mixed together in a fishbowl served with dry ice and they won't serve it to just one person.

1878
02:06:34,231 --> 02:06:35,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you can't order a one-person serving.

1879
02:06:35,913 --> 02:06:37,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, they have it different now.

1880
02:06:37,614 --> 02:06:39,475
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't order a one-person serving.

1881
02:06:39,876 --> 02:06:41,397
[SPEAKER_17]: The DDR Freak Moderator's Trip.

1882
02:06:42,217 --> 02:06:43,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a friend that lives in Vegas.

1883
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:44,920
[SPEAKER_17]: My friend Ciara.

1884
02:06:46,048 --> 02:06:52,340
[SPEAKER_17]: There was me and Iguana Girl and her boyfriend Islander and my friend Tiara and her man.

1885
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,622
[SPEAKER_17]: We all go to the Warp Corp.

1886
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,932
[SPEAKER_17]: We all go to the Star Trek experience and proceed to go on the ride once.

1887
02:06:59,904 --> 02:07:01,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Then have a warp core breach.

1888
02:07:01,885 --> 02:07:03,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Go on the ride again.

1889
02:07:03,126 --> 02:07:07,949
[SPEAKER_16]: That's exactly what I did at the 25th RockyCon, which was the first time I ever saw DDR, by the way.

1890
02:07:07,969 --> 02:07:18,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, my friends left, and it was just me and Iguana Girl and Islander, and we all decided that we were going to go over to Circus Circus and play DDR in there.

1891
02:07:18,456 --> 02:07:24,339
[SPEAKER_16]: That's exactly what I ended up doing, and I ended up... I believe I threw up the Romulan chicken strips later that night.

1892
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,741
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a tribute to that first time on DDR.

1893
02:07:28,022 --> 02:07:28,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh...

1894
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:32,101
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was, half the tab was broken.

1895
02:07:32,941 --> 02:07:37,243
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was just like the... Drunken DDR is cool.

1896
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:38,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Drunken DDR rules.

1897
02:07:38,623 --> 02:07:42,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially on a Warp Corp, because we were like plenty drunk after we played DDR.

1898
02:07:42,965 --> 02:07:43,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1899
02:07:44,365 --> 02:07:45,305
[SPEAKER_16]: So now here we do it.

1900
02:07:45,345 --> 02:07:46,026
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a list.

1901
02:07:46,146 --> 02:07:50,307
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a... I was not expecting the list to look this diverse, that's for sure.

1902
02:07:50,927 --> 02:07:52,708
[SPEAKER_16]: A few notable exceptions.

1903
02:07:52,928 --> 02:07:56,329
[SPEAKER_16]: According to our chatroom, we have made a few notable exceptions, including...

1904
02:07:57,874 --> 02:07:58,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Water.

1905
02:07:59,796 --> 02:08:00,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I said oxygenated water.

1906
02:08:01,198 --> 02:08:03,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Pepsi Blue is the big thing right now.

1907
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:04,581
[SPEAKER_17]: That stuff is shit.

1908
02:08:04,862 --> 02:08:07,705
[SPEAKER_17]: It tastes like someone ate strawberries and puked them.

1909
02:08:08,205 --> 02:08:13,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking about that, but Vanilla Coke Icy's like so own that, because they do.

1910
02:08:14,031 --> 02:08:15,633
[SPEAKER_17]: That Pepsi Blue shit is nasty.

1911
02:08:17,125 --> 02:08:19,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard it makes you shit green, but I haven't really tested that.

1912
02:08:19,728 --> 02:08:21,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, nope, nope, alright.

1913
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:24,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, uh, also, uh, Pussy Juice was another suggestion.

1914
02:08:38,346 --> 02:08:41,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually thinking of saying that, but then I was like, no.

1915
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:45,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Red Fusion, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.

1916
02:08:45,373 --> 02:08:47,414
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, let's just go ahead and vote.

1917
02:08:47,675 --> 02:08:49,697
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, a bunch of those new trendy drinks.

1918
02:08:49,717 --> 02:08:51,838
[SPEAKER_14]: So they didn't make the list, so F you.

1919
02:08:52,759 --> 02:08:53,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's our list.

1920
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:56,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Oxygenated water, 40 ounce malt liquor, Jolt,

1921
02:08:56,883 --> 02:09:11,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Strawberry Snowbubble, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Imported Mexican Tap Water, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Red Bull, Picari Sweat, Surge, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

1922
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:15,361
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we're going to start eliminating shit from this list right now.

1923
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:17,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, what the fuck's coming off this list?

1924
02:09:17,582 --> 02:09:18,962
[SPEAKER_17]: The imported Mexican tap water.

1925
02:09:19,503 --> 02:09:25,625
[SPEAKER_17]: I would prefer not to play DDR until they have explosive diarrhea.

1926
02:09:25,685 --> 02:09:27,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Diarrhea, diarrhea revolution.

1927
02:09:27,465 --> 02:09:30,326
[SPEAKER_16]: So, imported Mexican tap water's coming off the list.

1928
02:09:31,426 --> 02:09:33,007
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a cry.

1929
02:09:33,827 --> 02:09:35,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, what's coming off the list?

1930
02:09:36,568 --> 02:09:42,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to say goodbye to Red Bull because, yeah, it does look like pee.

1931
02:09:42,837 --> 02:09:46,483
[SPEAKER_15]: It smells like pee and probably is pee, but that's all right.

1932
02:09:47,094 --> 02:09:48,395
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so Red Bull's gone.

1933
02:09:49,555 --> 02:09:49,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Fine.

1934
02:09:50,495 --> 02:09:51,116
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know what?

1935
02:09:51,136 --> 02:09:56,018
[SPEAKER_16]: You gotta mix it with Malibu, but I didn't want to sound like a lush, because I don't know if you realize, but all my other drinks are alcoholic.

1936
02:09:56,078 --> 02:09:56,478
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyway.

1937
02:09:59,059 --> 02:09:59,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1938
02:09:59,779 --> 02:10:01,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, what's coming off the list?

1939
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:09,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Having not had most of these, such as the Warp Core Breach or something like that, or, you know, Goldschlager... You're just gonna have to trust us.

1940
02:10:09,923 --> 02:10:11,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I think... Yeah, I know.

1941
02:10:12,264 --> 02:10:15,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'll take off the Strawberry Snowbubble, because... What...

1942
02:10:16,946 --> 02:10:23,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it would seem like it would be too heavy to play DDR afterwards if it was all milky.

1943
02:10:24,191 --> 02:10:27,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but it just doesn't seem like the type of DDR drink.

1944
02:10:27,413 --> 02:10:32,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I think they'll go have a strawberry snow bubble and go play Waka Laka.

1945
02:10:32,416 --> 02:10:35,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't have been able to do that in the first place because it's only a max one.

1946
02:10:35,618 --> 02:10:37,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Strawberry snow bubbles off the list.

1947
02:10:37,119 --> 02:10:37,439
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1948
02:10:38,468 --> 02:10:41,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab, what's coming off this list of what's left here?

1949
02:10:41,371 --> 02:10:43,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's see.

1950
02:10:44,274 --> 02:10:51,662
[SPEAKER_11]: As original as some of these are, I'd say the 40 ounce has to go.

1951
02:10:51,682 --> 02:10:54,044
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just a bit too much liquid to drink.

1952
02:10:54,064 --> 02:10:56,307
[SPEAKER_16]: 40 ounce malt liquors coming off the list.

1953
02:10:56,934 --> 02:10:58,196
[SPEAKER_17]: You just made Billy Dee cry.

1954
02:11:00,038 --> 02:11:01,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to watch him cry.

1955
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:08,809
[SPEAKER_17]: When I come home from a hard day of playing DDR, I like to relax with a nice ice cold Colt 45.

1956
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:12,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, another notable exception we left off the list.

1957
02:11:12,654 --> 02:11:13,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Balls.

1958
02:11:14,278 --> 02:11:16,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Balls!

1959
02:11:16,459 --> 02:11:17,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's give Balls the honorable mention.

1960
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:18,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

1961
02:11:18,901 --> 02:11:20,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Balls got forgotten.

1962
02:11:20,442 --> 02:11:22,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously none of us are drinking Balls.

1963
02:11:22,984 --> 02:11:26,846
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd say maybe if we thought of it before we started eliminating drinks, then yes.

1964
02:11:26,926 --> 02:11:28,127
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, too late now.

1965
02:11:28,227 --> 02:11:28,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Too late now.

1966
02:11:29,988 --> 02:11:31,309
[SPEAKER_16]: It gets an honorable mention.

1967
02:11:31,549 --> 02:11:31,970
[SPEAKER_16]: How's that?

1968
02:11:32,370 --> 02:11:33,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Balls gets an honorable mention.

1969
02:11:36,317 --> 02:11:37,258
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

1970
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:41,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have to repeat it.

1971
02:11:41,502 --> 02:11:46,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab said... Okay, I said, I had never had balls.

1972
02:11:47,027 --> 02:11:48,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Referring to the drink.

1973
02:11:48,868 --> 02:11:50,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Blue balls on top of that.

1974
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:52,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, can I finish?

1975
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:53,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I get to take my drink off now?

1976
02:11:53,452 --> 02:11:54,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1977
02:11:54,593 --> 02:11:56,295
[SPEAKER_16]: My drink, this is an easy pick for me.

1978
02:11:56,335 --> 02:11:59,478
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this stuff tastes like turpentine, cat pee, I hate it.

1979
02:11:59,818 --> 02:12:00,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye bye, Surge.

1980
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:01,540
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate Surge.

1981
02:12:04,114 --> 02:12:05,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I fucking love search.

1982
02:12:05,095 --> 02:12:08,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, this is the first time that none of mine have been eliminated ever.

1983
02:12:08,656 --> 02:12:09,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been keeping track.

1984
02:12:09,676 --> 02:12:10,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Poor Matt is denied.

1985
02:12:10,657 --> 02:12:11,597
[SPEAKER_17]: The first time ever.

1986
02:12:11,937 --> 02:12:12,737
[SPEAKER_17]: You are denied.

1987
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:16,059
[SPEAKER_16]: For those keeping score at home, all of Loki's picks got eliminated.

1988
02:12:17,919 --> 02:12:18,840
[SPEAKER_17]: And how does that make you feel?

1989
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:20,760
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

1990
02:12:21,901 --> 02:12:22,181
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll live.

1991
02:12:23,004 --> 02:12:24,626
[SPEAKER_16]: God, Surge tastes like shit.

1992
02:12:24,686 --> 02:12:26,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, important message.

1993
02:12:26,528 --> 02:12:31,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, if you don't like Surge, you can drink that Pesty Blue shit.

1994
02:12:32,074 --> 02:12:32,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1995
02:12:32,434 --> 02:12:33,855
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, yes.

1996
02:12:33,895 --> 02:12:36,979
[SPEAKER_15]: For Lamb's Blood, but, you know, I didn't add that on there.

1997
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:38,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Lamb's Blood?

1998
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,822
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a sick bastard.

1999
02:12:40,751 --> 02:12:43,713
[SPEAKER_17]: How about, like, cow brain mucus?

2000
02:12:44,174 --> 02:12:44,514
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2001
02:12:46,856 --> 02:12:48,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Yuck, you guys are weird.

2002
02:12:48,357 --> 02:12:50,138
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are so weird.

2003
02:12:50,538 --> 02:13:00,466
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure it was the time that we were at Brookfields and Sheepham ordered, what was it, a monkey's brain or something?

2004
02:13:01,187 --> 02:13:01,747
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember.

2005
02:13:01,787 --> 02:13:02,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I was there.

2006
02:13:02,628 --> 02:13:04,109
[SPEAKER_17]: That was great.

2007
02:13:04,129 --> 02:13:05,490
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but he ordered it.

2008
02:13:09,626 --> 02:13:11,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm loading up a song here to play during the break here.

2009
02:13:15,411 --> 02:13:22,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to have Jamie read the list and then I'll paste it in the chat room and you guys will have five minutes to vote.

2010
02:13:22,676 --> 02:13:25,999
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Jamie, would you please let me post it in the chat room.

2011
02:13:26,019 --> 02:13:28,621
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to send me your vote over a private message in the chat room.

2012
02:13:30,823 --> 02:13:33,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, would you be so kind as to read this list off?

2013
02:13:34,045 --> 02:13:35,646
[SPEAKER_17]: There, unhighlighted.

2014
02:13:35,846 --> 02:13:36,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Oxygenated water.

2015
02:13:38,368 --> 02:13:38,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Goldslugger.

2016
02:13:39,614 --> 02:13:49,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Berry Propel, Vanilla Cook IC, Snapple Atomic Elements, Bokari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

2017
02:13:50,877 --> 02:13:51,858
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so there it is.

2018
02:13:51,938 --> 02:13:54,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Send me your votes over private message in the chat room.

2019
02:13:54,278 --> 02:13:56,279
[SPEAKER_16]: If they don't come over private message, they don't count.

2020
02:13:56,779 --> 02:13:59,120
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break.

2021
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:01,240
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just trying to cue up some music for you guys.

2022
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:02,961
[SPEAKER_16]: No, just to...

2023
02:14:04,401 --> 02:14:08,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to reiterate for you guys, no, what you vote for will not be taken off the list.

2024
02:14:08,443 --> 02:14:09,284
[SPEAKER_16]: We've already done that.

2025
02:14:09,324 --> 02:14:10,445
[SPEAKER_16]: That was all done in-house.

2026
02:14:10,665 --> 02:14:12,546
[SPEAKER_16]: We're the celebrities, so we get to do that.

2027
02:14:12,926 --> 02:14:14,227
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are picking the winners.

2028
02:14:14,307 --> 02:14:15,868
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are picking the top three.

2029
02:14:15,928 --> 02:14:19,150
[SPEAKER_16]: So out of that list, you're just going to send me your favorite.

2030
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:25,955
[SPEAKER_16]: and whatever gets the most votes wins.

2031
02:14:26,055 --> 02:14:28,578
[SPEAKER_16]: First place and whatever gets second most votes gets second place.

2032
02:14:28,838 --> 02:14:31,460
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're voting for your very favorite out of that list.

2033
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:39,287
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, here's a song that is often requested on the station ever since we played it on one of Jamie's... No, not Dirty.

2034
02:14:39,387 --> 02:14:41,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Dirty is requested, but it's not that.

2035
02:14:41,909 --> 02:14:46,773
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something that Jamie put on one of her pre-shows and everybody's loved it since then, so we're going to play it during the actual show.

2036
02:14:47,675 --> 02:14:48,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Here you go.

2037
02:14:48,457 --> 02:14:49,762
[SPEAKER_16]: You got five minutes to vote.

2038
02:14:50,023 --> 02:14:50,726
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be right back.

2039
02:14:51,729 --> 02:14:53,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's play some Tetris, motherfucker.

2040
02:15:57,669 --> 02:15:59,390
And you're feelin' like I'm feelin'

2041
02:16:24,924 --> 02:16:27,946
And you feel it, feel it And you feel it, feel it

2042
02:19:55,083 --> 02:19:55,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2043
02:20:54,978 --> 02:20:55,720
Thanks for watching!

2044
02:21:23,442 --> 02:21:24,182
Thanks for watching!

2045
02:22:34,673 --> 02:22:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

2046
02:22:43,279 --> 02:22:49,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2047
02:22:49,483 --> 02:23:00,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just finished up, or we're finishing up, we're bringing an end to our listless segment, where we are determining the best Behmany drink.

2048
02:23:01,151 --> 02:23:02,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was the final list, what Dave?

2049
02:23:03,172 --> 02:23:05,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I just beat Spin the Disc on 2DX and 7.

2050
02:23:06,313 --> 02:23:06,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

2051
02:23:06,913 --> 02:23:08,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, that's my fifth seven star.

2052
02:23:08,953 --> 02:23:10,654
[SPEAKER_16]: All the girls want to have sex with you now.

2053
02:23:10,954 --> 02:23:11,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

2054
02:23:11,754 --> 02:23:13,134
[SPEAKER_14]: How many girls are even listening?

2055
02:23:13,514 --> 02:23:15,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how many girls are listening.

2056
02:23:15,275 --> 02:23:16,415
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get that kind of breakdown.

2057
02:23:16,835 --> 02:23:17,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Twin.

2058
02:23:17,635 --> 02:23:17,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

2059
02:23:18,676 --> 02:23:19,456
[SPEAKER_17]: We're kidding.

2060
02:23:19,476 --> 02:23:22,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

2061
02:23:22,616 --> 02:23:22,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Newt.

2062
02:23:23,137 --> 02:23:23,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Newt.

2063
02:23:23,597 --> 02:23:23,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Newt.

2064
02:23:23,877 --> 02:23:24,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

2065
02:23:26,525 --> 02:23:27,266
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the list.

2066
02:23:27,506 --> 02:23:37,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Oxygenated Water, Jolt, Goldschlager, Berry Propel, Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Pocari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

2067
02:23:37,292 --> 02:23:38,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And now... Wait, hold on, hold on.

2068
02:23:38,553 --> 02:23:38,813
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2069
02:23:39,033 --> 02:23:42,856
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have to say, if, like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date him.

2070
02:23:43,016 --> 02:23:43,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway!

2071
02:23:43,776 --> 02:23:44,517
[SPEAKER_14]: She's in a lesbian drive.

2072
02:23:44,577 --> 02:23:45,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway!

2073
02:23:46,318 --> 02:23:47,339
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that have to do with the money?

2074
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:47,999
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not cool.

2075
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Not cool.

2076
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:51,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Spreading personal information out on the radio.

2077
02:23:51,682 --> 02:23:51,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

2078
02:23:52,512 --> 02:23:55,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, after you're talking about your whole hooker experience.

2079
02:23:55,915 --> 02:23:57,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, that is me sharing, okay?

2080
02:23:58,036 --> 02:23:59,577
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not me sharing about someone else.

2081
02:24:01,239 --> 02:24:03,921
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize if the hooker was listening to the radio show.

2082
02:24:04,021 --> 02:24:05,422
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't mean anything about it.

2083
02:24:05,902 --> 02:24:09,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Call me.

2084
02:24:09,885 --> 02:24:12,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we read the list now, or should we just throw the list away?

2085
02:24:12,787 --> 02:24:18,031
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but I haven't read the top three, the climax of this whole segment.

2086
02:24:18,051 --> 02:24:18,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

2087
02:24:21,055 --> 02:24:23,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Surely you guys wouldn't let me get through a segment without climaxing.

2088
02:24:23,737 --> 02:24:24,337
[SPEAKER_16]: No guy would.

2089
02:24:24,537 --> 02:24:25,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Surely Temple.

2090
02:24:26,158 --> 02:24:26,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, go.

2091
02:24:27,199 --> 02:24:27,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2092
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:34,083
[SPEAKER_16]: The number three best Bomani drink is Hawaiian Punch.

2093
02:24:34,103 --> 02:24:37,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, Hawaiian Punch.

2094
02:24:37,805 --> 02:24:39,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, want a Hawaiian Punch?

2095
02:24:39,947 --> 02:24:40,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Bam!

2096
02:24:40,527 --> 02:24:40,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2097
02:24:43,029 --> 02:24:48,052
[SPEAKER_16]: The number two best Bomani drink is a Vanilla Coke Icy.

2098
02:24:48,092 --> 02:24:48,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

2099
02:24:51,710 --> 02:24:52,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn all you trendy whores.

2100
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:53,570
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

2101
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:55,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanilla Coke Iced, these are good.

2102
02:24:55,791 --> 02:25:03,812
[SPEAKER_16]: And the number one best Behmany drink of all time is... Pocari Sweat.

2103
02:25:06,933 --> 02:25:08,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie is a winner.

2104
02:25:08,373 --> 02:25:10,973
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the second one I've gotten the first place on.

2105
02:25:14,854 --> 02:25:15,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so there you go.

2106
02:25:16,034 --> 02:25:17,135
[SPEAKER_16]: That is the list.

2107
02:25:18,615 --> 02:25:19,395
[SPEAKER_16]: That was cool.

2108
02:25:20,208 --> 02:25:22,176
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it, I know, we still got a half hour of show left.

2109
02:25:22,216 --> 02:25:23,400
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't end at 9 anymore, we end at 9.30.

2110
02:25:23,982 --> 02:25:24,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Loki!

2111
02:25:24,846 --> 02:25:25,046
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2112
02:25:25,899 --> 02:25:27,940
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got plenty to fill a half an hour.

2113
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,541
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is Bomani?

2114
02:25:29,941 --> 02:25:32,062
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's Bomani stuff, not another hooker story.

2115
02:25:32,082 --> 02:25:34,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I only have one hooker story and I just used it.

2116
02:25:35,864 --> 02:25:36,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Sim update.

2117
02:25:36,985 --> 02:25:39,046
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got plenty of stuff to talk about.

2118
02:25:39,126 --> 02:25:45,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, first thing, Tourney Mix 3 has been finally announced officially, so it's on.

2119
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:50,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Judging will begin sometime, I don't know, I don't have the dates in front of me.

2120
02:25:50,692 --> 02:25:54,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it ends on the 31st, that's when the results will be posted, but

2121
02:25:55,615 --> 02:26:00,916
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of... I guess December 15th is when they start doing it.

2122
02:26:00,936 --> 02:26:02,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't hear you unless you're talking to the mic.

2123
02:26:02,116 --> 02:26:03,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever, it doesn't matter.

2124
02:26:03,457 --> 02:26:09,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so... Yeah, it's on, so just, you know, go check out the rules because there's plenty of them.

2125
02:26:10,178 --> 02:26:14,559
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to... They're really being strict about what they're doing this time, so do check that out.

2126
02:26:15,919 --> 02:26:17,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, there's another tournament going on.

2127
02:26:17,919 --> 02:26:19,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even sure what it is.

2128
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:20,360
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like...

2129
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:26,386
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, it's some other sim tournament that I really wasn't paying attention to.

2130
02:26:27,347 --> 02:26:35,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's out there too, so I'm sure someone will... Oh yes, and MakeEditGetPorn, that is still going on, so don't forget about that one.

2131
02:26:35,356 --> 02:26:40,622
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I forgot to ask about the MakeEditGetPorn contest is everybody who enters get porn, or just the winners?

2132
02:26:40,862 --> 02:26:41,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the winners.

2133
02:26:41,842 --> 02:26:42,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Just making sure.

2134
02:26:42,443 --> 02:26:44,664
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, that's a lot of porn for you to be sending out.

2135
02:26:45,264 --> 02:26:47,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I could do it, but... So just the winners.

2136
02:26:47,785 --> 02:26:48,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the top three.

2137
02:26:48,265 --> 02:26:49,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the winners will get porn.

2138
02:26:49,926 --> 02:26:51,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Third place gets a little porn.

2139
02:26:51,147 --> 02:26:52,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Second place gets... Nope.

2140
02:26:52,607 --> 02:26:53,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Just first place.

2141
02:26:54,268 --> 02:26:54,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

2142
02:26:55,009 --> 02:26:57,510
[SPEAKER_16]: The first place person is going to get all the porn?

2143
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:58,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2144
02:26:58,230 --> 02:26:59,711
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a lot of porn.

2145
02:26:59,731 --> 02:27:00,151
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2146
02:27:00,171 --> 02:27:02,052
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see how much porn I can acquire from...

2147
02:27:02,552 --> 02:27:08,277
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to have an honorary... You have to specify if you want girl porn or boy porn, because there is going to be a boy porn prize.

2148
02:27:08,417 --> 02:27:10,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, not by me, but... We'll find something.

2149
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:12,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge will donate a boy porn prize.

2150
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:13,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2151
02:27:14,241 --> 02:27:17,003
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways, yeah, Max Beats is the other one.

2152
02:27:17,644 --> 02:27:21,467
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the other contest going on there, and there's like five categories entered there.

2153
02:27:21,507 --> 02:27:23,228
[SPEAKER_15]: No prizes for that, but yeah, it's fine.

2154
02:27:23,608 --> 02:27:25,330
[SPEAKER_15]: So go check that one out, too.

2155
02:27:26,391 --> 02:27:30,394
[SPEAKER_15]: And, see, other than that, there's been some updates...

2156
02:27:30,774 --> 02:27:34,737
[SPEAKER_15]: DWI finally decided to update their stuff.

2157
02:27:35,378 --> 02:27:37,279
[SPEAKER_15]: So now they're trying to play catch up.

2158
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:39,181
[SPEAKER_15]: They're, I guess, playing catch up.

2159
02:27:39,241 --> 02:27:46,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, they added the extra stage support for that, which Step Mania's had for a while now.

2160
02:27:46,787 --> 02:27:50,189
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're also fixing a few other bugs.

2161
02:27:50,209 --> 02:27:53,312
[SPEAKER_15]: They're still a good mile behind Step Mania.

2162
02:27:54,473 --> 02:27:58,496
[SPEAKER_15]: No updates on Step Mania, but it's pretty good so far, so just check it out.

2163
02:28:00,437 --> 02:28:06,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, DDRUK, they are putting together a lot of synced sets, full sets of files to download.

2164
02:28:06,861 --> 02:28:10,444
[SPEAKER_15]: They have full sets of Disney's Rave.

2165
02:28:11,064 --> 02:28:13,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have to say that's not completely full.

2166
02:28:13,026 --> 02:28:16,048
[SPEAKER_15]: They're missing some of the double steps, but I mean, for the most part.

2167
02:28:16,208 --> 02:28:17,829
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just if you're being anal retentive.

2168
02:28:17,909 --> 02:28:19,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, for the most part, it's complete.

2169
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:24,933
[SPEAKER_15]: They also have full sets of Euromix 1 and 2, all synced.

2170
02:28:25,354 --> 02:28:28,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have Club Mix, the club of pens on there.

2171
02:28:29,825 --> 02:28:33,169
[SPEAKER_16]: You're starting a fight here in the chatroom, StepMania versus DWI.

2172
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:35,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I don't care.

2173
02:28:36,413 --> 02:28:37,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Let them fight!

2174
02:28:37,594 --> 02:28:38,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Let them kill each other!

2175
02:28:39,597 --> 02:28:47,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so, yeah, those, go check that out, and I know for a fact, because I kind of help, that there will be a MOHA stuff.

2176
02:28:50,128 --> 02:28:53,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Jamie has a question Have they ever done any of the Tokimeki songs?

2177
02:28:54,011 --> 02:28:54,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, all of them

2178
02:29:20,639 --> 02:29:23,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I still haven't figured out how to get to that point, because I have Tokimeki 2.

2179
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I have all of them.

2180
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:27,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure they'll be releasing a pack for that, too.

2181
02:29:28,401 --> 02:29:29,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

2182
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:32,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually considering entering Tourney Mix 3, by the way.

2183
02:29:32,222 --> 02:29:34,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to ask you if my song's been used before, though, but I'll ask you off-air.

2184
02:29:35,082 --> 02:29:35,683
[SPEAKER_16]: The one I want to do.

2185
02:29:35,983 --> 02:29:40,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I've already... See, this is what I've been doing today, is deciding which song I want to do.

2186
02:29:40,424 --> 02:29:43,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I've narrowed it down to a couple options.

2187
02:29:43,905 --> 02:29:45,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I already know, but I have a feeling it's been done.

2188
02:29:45,985 --> 02:29:50,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, number one was Things of Manory, and that was by Tack.

2189
02:29:51,328 --> 02:29:52,949
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll instantly get my vote.

2190
02:29:53,230 --> 02:29:58,433
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a six minute long song, I just cut it down to just over two and a half minutes.

2191
02:29:58,953 --> 02:30:00,094
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have that one.

2192
02:30:00,634 --> 02:30:05,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I have an 80s track that's being remixed, which is so far in the lead in my picks.

2193
02:30:05,897 --> 02:30:10,100
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Amanda, originally by Boston, and it's covered by Brooklyn Queens.

2194
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,241
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Ford's Transmix.

2195
02:30:11,821 --> 02:30:15,823
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really catchy song, so maybe we can play that later.

2196
02:30:15,843 --> 02:30:17,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I've heard of this album.

2197
02:30:17,724 --> 02:30:18,904
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's pretty sweet.

2198
02:30:18,924 --> 02:30:20,405
[SPEAKER_16]: This is like another 80s trance.

2199
02:30:20,445 --> 02:30:22,225
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to need to copy this before you leave, okay?

2200
02:30:22,345 --> 02:30:22,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, okay.

2201
02:30:22,926 --> 02:30:24,006
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got Journey on it.

2202
02:30:24,046 --> 02:30:24,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

2203
02:30:25,367 --> 02:30:25,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2204
02:30:25,547 --> 02:30:26,547
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not really Journey.

2205
02:30:26,727 --> 02:30:28,188
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like an update.

2206
02:30:28,268 --> 02:30:30,049
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought an album just like this the other day.

2207
02:30:30,109 --> 02:30:30,829
[SPEAKER_16]: That's so crazy.

2208
02:30:31,129 --> 02:30:31,909
[SPEAKER_16]: What album did you get?

2209
02:30:32,130 --> 02:30:32,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I got one.

2210
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:33,930
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called Time After Time.

2211
02:30:33,970 --> 02:30:34,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn it!

2212
02:30:34,330 --> 02:30:35,511
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the one I've been looking for.

2213
02:30:35,671 --> 02:30:36,251
[SPEAKER_15]: I got that one.

2214
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:37,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to get a copy of that.

2215
02:30:37,172 --> 02:30:37,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2216
02:30:37,392 --> 02:30:37,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Sweet.

2217
02:30:38,632 --> 02:30:39,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, back on the subject.

2218
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:42,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Back on the subject here.

2219
02:30:43,081 --> 02:30:45,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, you've got a random Beatmania track.

2220
02:30:45,762 --> 02:30:48,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I was looking at Hyperboundary Gate or Alien World.

2221
02:30:49,104 --> 02:30:51,365
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's by Ping Pong.

2222
02:30:51,605 --> 02:30:53,726
[SPEAKER_15]: It's from Beatmania the final, I think.

2223
02:30:54,226 --> 02:30:55,907
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was deciding between one of those.

2224
02:30:55,947 --> 02:30:59,789
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's probably going to be Amanda because it's just a catchy song.

2225
02:30:59,909 --> 02:31:06,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I've recognized the original, but it's just a catchy song and it'll be fun.

2226
02:31:06,912 --> 02:31:09,413
[SPEAKER_16]: So now you're going to get five people doing that because they all heard you were going to do it.

2227
02:31:09,433 --> 02:31:10,574
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all going to copy you.

2228
02:31:10,934 --> 02:31:12,375
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine, whatever, I don't care.

2229
02:31:12,916 --> 02:31:15,978
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, has that ever happened in those contests where two people end up doing the same song?

2230
02:31:16,158 --> 02:31:19,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there was one with Mr. Larpus, I think.

2231
02:31:20,902 --> 02:31:22,964
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Tourney Mix 1, they did that.

2232
02:31:23,064 --> 02:31:24,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Dope.

2233
02:31:24,225 --> 02:31:25,546
[SPEAKER_16]: They both end up losing, huh?

2234
02:31:26,987 --> 02:31:28,408
[SPEAKER_16]: because they cancel each other's votes out.

2235
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,628
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I've got to make sure my song hasn't been done before.

2236
02:31:30,648 --> 02:31:34,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I'm doing that one, and it'll be pretty cool.

2237
02:31:34,149 --> 02:31:39,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm sure there'll be someone probably doing Sakura and someone probably doing Xenon, which those have been done.

2238
02:31:39,731 --> 02:31:43,112
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Sakura has 4,000 of them out there, so no one's going to vote for that.

2239
02:31:43,432 --> 02:31:45,833
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure BimaniRuler will sneak one out.

2240
02:31:45,953 --> 02:31:54,856
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only one song that he has that was being released in the last set of released ones that he didn't quite get out, and that was The Return.

2241
02:31:55,436 --> 02:32:01,723
[SPEAKER_15]: My guess, if he was to enter and be lazy and not actually make a new file, it'd be here to release the return.

2242
02:32:02,023 --> 02:32:06,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, I heard is a really good transtrack, but it's seven minutes long, so that's probably not going to happen.

2243
02:32:07,089 --> 02:32:07,269
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

2244
02:32:07,813 --> 02:32:08,634
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2245
02:32:28,054 --> 02:32:41,442
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, also my site, of course I've got to plug it again, leechfromloki.tk I'm getting to a point where I'm going to try to upload every single Beatmania song I have made right now by other people.

2246
02:32:41,602 --> 02:32:42,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I just got a few more the other day.

2247
02:32:43,003 --> 02:32:46,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I got Happy Wedding from... Happy to, happy to, happy to...

2248
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:48,370
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2249
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:06,761
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few other ones I got files for.

2250
02:33:06,781 --> 02:33:08,121
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to be trying to upload.

2251
02:33:08,161 --> 02:33:16,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to reformat my whole page just to organize them in style groups and that type of thing so I can actually start uploading them easier that way.

2252
02:33:16,564 --> 02:33:18,425
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's a lot of work.

2253
02:33:18,465 --> 02:33:20,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably come see that next week.

2254
02:33:20,686 --> 02:33:21,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'll try to upload something tonight.

2255
02:33:22,967 --> 02:33:23,287
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

2256
02:33:24,324 --> 02:33:31,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, oh, and releases, as far as home releases, Dancing Stage Party Edition finally came out.

2257
02:33:32,134 --> 02:33:38,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Only problem is it has a huge freaking bug in it, which won't make it play on PS1s or PlayStations.

2258
02:33:38,461 --> 02:33:39,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So that kind of sucks.

2259
02:33:39,923 --> 02:33:42,747
[SPEAKER_15]: It only plays on PS2s for some reason, even though it's a PS1 game.

2260
02:33:42,967 --> 02:33:43,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops.

2261
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:49,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I want a copy of that, because I want to dance to Kylie Minogue.

2262
02:33:50,395 --> 02:33:51,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't get you out of my head.

2263
02:33:51,576 --> 02:34:02,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hey, you know what, I'm sure that... I'm sure you'll see people that are in the UK, like NMR and that kind of stuff, they'll probably rip them.

2264
02:34:03,249 --> 02:34:04,610
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'll probably see those out there.

2265
02:34:05,351 --> 02:34:06,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

2266
02:34:24,033 --> 02:34:24,634
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2267
02:34:44,034 --> 02:34:47,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess this is really old news, but it's new to me, and I'm just behind the times.

2268
02:34:47,915 --> 02:34:48,635
[SPEAKER_16]: What can I say?

2269
02:34:48,795 --> 02:34:52,676
[SPEAKER_17]: There's actually a hack done on Mega Man that's all done with DDR music.

2270
02:34:53,117 --> 02:34:53,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard of that.

2271
02:34:55,337 --> 02:34:56,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't Aaron in Japan do that one?

2272
02:34:57,258 --> 02:34:58,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, DDR Man.

2273
02:34:58,478 --> 02:35:00,519
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if he did it, but he's got it on his site.

2274
02:35:00,539 --> 02:35:01,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got the MIDI files on my computer.

2275
02:35:01,879 --> 02:35:02,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bring them next week.

2276
02:35:03,139 --> 02:35:05,460
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe we, you know what, I think we did that one episode.

2277
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:06,020
[SPEAKER_16]: You weren't here.

2278
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:06,720
[SPEAKER_16]: We went through it.

2279
02:35:07,341 --> 02:35:09,221
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about Game Boy DDR music.

2280
02:35:09,581 --> 02:35:09,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2281
02:35:10,021 --> 02:35:11,462
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got them to 2DX midis.

2282
02:35:11,562 --> 02:35:12,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We could do those.

2283
02:35:13,070 --> 02:35:14,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, 2DX Middies, that would be a fun show.

2284
02:35:17,697 --> 02:35:21,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, so what else is going on in DDR Bomani world right now?

2285
02:35:22,163 --> 02:35:22,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Shaft is over.

2286
02:35:23,324 --> 02:35:23,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Shaft is over.

2287
02:35:24,226 --> 02:35:27,029
[SPEAKER_16]: I know some big news that's coming up.

2288
02:35:27,470 --> 02:35:27,650
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2289
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:27,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2290
02:35:31,147 --> 02:35:35,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, we've got Southern Hills Golf Land is closing.

2291
02:35:35,409 --> 02:35:37,269
[SPEAKER_16]: That was one big news item that came out this week.

2292
02:35:37,309 --> 02:35:44,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Shiggle, one of the big golf lands, of course, popular guy, Shiggle Boss over on some of the message boards.

2293
02:35:45,232 --> 02:35:48,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And that place is closing.

2294
02:35:48,633 --> 02:35:53,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently what's happened is the city council has rezoned that area to be some residential housing.

2295
02:35:54,095 --> 02:35:57,598
[SPEAKER_16]: So Shiggle's going to be closing down, and who knows where those games will be going.

2296
02:35:57,658 --> 02:35:59,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably to the Camelot Golf Land nearby.

2297
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:06,106
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to mention that if anyone looked at their calendar this week, they would notice that the 20th falls on a Wednesday next week.

2298
02:36:06,526 --> 02:36:10,629
[SPEAKER_15]: And so 20 November, obviously you're going to have a bunch of new stuff going on in the DDR community.

2299
02:36:10,649 --> 02:36:11,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Big Bomani thing.

2300
02:36:11,470 --> 02:36:14,573
[SPEAKER_16]: I happen to know there's one major website relaunching on 20 November.

2301
02:36:14,653 --> 02:36:17,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, the number one... You'll know the spot to go to.

2302
02:36:18,056 --> 02:36:18,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2303
02:36:19,636 --> 02:36:24,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, ddrspot.com is relaunching starting on the 20th, so check that out.

2304
02:36:25,158 --> 02:36:28,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I know SoCalKicks' site just relaunched.

2305
02:36:28,259 --> 02:36:30,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, he had to cancel it.

2306
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,360
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the big news.

2307
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:32,760
[SPEAKER_16]: He had to cancel that.

2308
02:36:33,001 --> 02:36:34,621
[SPEAKER_16]: And he has a new tagline, by the way.

2309
02:36:34,641 --> 02:36:35,921
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll show this to you guys now.

2310
02:36:36,081 --> 02:36:38,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Because remember last week we were talking about the SoCalKicks tagline.

2311
02:36:38,622 --> 02:36:43,844
[SPEAKER_16]: And we love SoCalKicks because he did the Orange Lounge website, so we forever owe him sexual favors.

2312
02:36:46,232 --> 02:36:46,833
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not just me.

2313
02:36:46,873 --> 02:36:48,154
[SPEAKER_16]: But see, now he has new tagline.

2314
02:36:48,494 --> 02:36:51,037
[SPEAKER_16]: SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just later.

2315
02:36:52,358 --> 02:36:54,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of just now, it'll be just later.

2316
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:56,361
[SPEAKER_16]: That's funny.

2317
02:36:56,461 --> 02:37:00,986
[SPEAKER_16]: That kind of sucks for him, but we'll hope that he can get his website back up soon.

2318
02:37:01,026 --> 02:37:05,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, but MoneyStyle's going to be doing something, and same with 2DXStyle.com.

2319
02:37:05,810 --> 02:37:07,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, they're going to be doing some special shit.

2320
02:37:08,212 --> 02:37:24,615
[SPEAKER_15]: and maybe Orange Lounge Radio will do a special 20 November fuck off and you know what someone else is probably doing or I should say a certain somebody with a certain journal will be probably talking about 20 November as well since that does come out that day too

2321
02:37:24,963 --> 02:37:26,403
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the 19th of November?

2322
02:37:28,204 --> 02:37:28,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2323
02:37:29,264 --> 02:37:32,025
[SPEAKER_16]: And everybody's neglecting 19 November, which is by far a better song.

2324
02:37:32,385 --> 02:37:35,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diaries, today is 19 November.

2325
02:37:36,026 --> 02:37:39,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Today is when I fap it furiously, because tomorrow Politary is coming to my house.

2326
02:37:40,467 --> 02:37:42,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll put pictures of the internet in my journal.

2327
02:37:43,508 --> 02:37:48,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of journals, Jamie, you want to talk about the Orange Lounge Live Journal community that we have going now?

2328
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:51,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I set this up last Sunday right after the show.

2329
02:37:53,141 --> 02:38:01,786
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go to livejournal.com slash users slash orange lounge, that is our orange lounge community.

2330
02:38:01,826 --> 02:38:03,667
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you wish to join, it's open access.

2331
02:38:03,707 --> 02:38:05,848
[SPEAKER_17]: However, if you fuck it up, we'll kick your ass out.

2332
02:38:06,889 --> 02:38:10,551
[SPEAKER_16]: And what kind of posts will we expect to be seeing in the orange lounge live journal community?

2333
02:38:10,631 --> 02:38:11,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Random shit.

2334
02:38:11,731 --> 02:38:12,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like this show.

2335
02:38:12,952 --> 02:38:21,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, basically, you know, those of us who have something to contribute to the show or the BitMoney community, or even things that have been slightly related, like I posted deep thoughts in there because we did talk about it last week.

2336
02:38:22,678 --> 02:38:24,500
[SPEAKER_17]: or just, you know, things about the show.

2337
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,064
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we announced the time changes, different things.

2338
02:38:28,505 --> 02:38:29,606
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, go ahead and join up.

2339
02:38:29,666 --> 02:38:34,291
[SPEAKER_17]: And make sure, by the way, that you actually join the community instead of set it to watch.

2340
02:38:34,812 --> 02:38:37,174
[SPEAKER_17]: That way, if you join the community, you can post to it.

2341
02:38:37,595 --> 02:38:41,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, everybody who is a member of the community is also on the friends list page.

2342
02:38:41,199 --> 02:38:42,561
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, don't fuck it up.

2343
02:38:43,001 --> 02:38:44,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you fuck it up, your ass is out.

2344
02:38:44,403 --> 02:38:48,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but please post, because I think there's about five or six posts right now.

2345
02:38:48,609 --> 02:38:50,090
[SPEAKER_17]: There's five, but there's plenty on the friends list.

2346
02:38:50,391 --> 02:38:50,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, boy.

2347
02:38:51,452 --> 02:38:52,754
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to flood it, though.

2348
02:38:52,974 --> 02:38:58,642
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, so, you know, join, you don't have to post every day, but when you have something orange loungy to say, post it.

2349
02:38:59,002 --> 02:39:02,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate to disappoint everybody, but I don't update my live journal ever.

2350
02:39:03,187 --> 02:39:04,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now you have a reason to.

2351
02:39:04,389 --> 02:39:11,137
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because the only time that I talk in the live journal is like, guess what, my sim has a thousand songs now.

2352
02:39:11,498 --> 02:39:14,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Guess what, my sim has a thousand and five songs now.

2353
02:39:14,722 --> 02:39:15,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just like...

2354
02:39:18,414 --> 02:39:19,935
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a question from the chat room.

2355
02:39:20,015 --> 02:39:21,895
[SPEAKER_16]: How exactly do I join the community?

2356
02:39:22,236 --> 02:39:24,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, all you have to do, go to the info page.

2357
02:39:25,017 --> 02:39:27,157
[SPEAKER_16]: When you go to the Orange Tops community, there's an info page.

2358
02:39:27,177 --> 02:39:27,777
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be user info.

2359
02:39:27,978 --> 02:39:29,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And it'll say right at the top.

2360
02:39:29,458 --> 02:39:30,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, user info.

2361
02:39:30,258 --> 02:39:30,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll say right at the top.

2362
02:39:31,059 --> 02:39:33,139
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to join this community, click here.

2363
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And you want to list it as a friend, one of your friends.

2364
02:39:36,601 --> 02:39:38,701
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll have a picture of a person with a PlaySmart by their head.

2365
02:39:38,761 --> 02:39:41,902
[SPEAKER_16]: If you just listed as a friend, you're only going to be watching it.

2366
02:39:41,922 --> 02:39:42,883
[SPEAKER_16]: You haven't actually joined it.

2367
02:39:44,244 --> 02:39:46,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes.

2368
02:39:46,666 --> 02:39:56,814
[SPEAKER_16]: If you go to the profile and hit the click here link to join the community, it'll give you the option to set it as part of your Francis automatically, so you don't have to click the separate button on the profile page.

2369
02:39:57,995 --> 02:39:58,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2370
02:39:58,835 --> 02:40:00,276
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have a link posted in the chat room.

2371
02:40:00,556 --> 02:40:03,679
[SPEAKER_16]: And another question, why can't we make it on YouJournal?

2372
02:40:04,514 --> 02:40:07,295
[SPEAKER_16]: because everything else is just a rip-off of LiveJournal.

2373
02:40:07,515 --> 02:40:09,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, LiveJournal is open source.

2374
02:40:09,795 --> 02:40:12,455
[SPEAKER_16]: LiveJournal is open source, so everything else basically rips off it.

2375
02:40:13,396 --> 02:40:16,956
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you really, really need a LiveJournal code, I've got a few extra.

2376
02:40:16,976 --> 02:40:17,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a couple.

2377
02:40:18,877 --> 02:40:20,837
[SPEAKER_17]: If I think you don't suck, I'll give you one.

2378
02:40:20,857 --> 02:40:24,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, PM me on a forum you know I'm on, and maybe I'll give you a code.

2379
02:40:25,418 --> 02:40:25,878
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

2380
02:40:25,998 --> 02:40:26,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe.

2381
02:40:28,758 --> 02:40:29,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe.

2382
02:40:29,638 --> 02:40:30,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

2383
02:40:30,419 --> 02:40:31,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, other news.

2384
02:40:31,379 --> 02:40:32,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Any more money news we've got?

2385
02:40:34,406 --> 02:40:42,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, no, but I was going to say that if you ever catch me in the chatroom, you can almost guarantee that I'll be throwing up random porn links every now and then.

2386
02:40:42,333 --> 02:40:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to check... I'm there!

2387
02:40:46,116 --> 02:40:47,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never seen you in there.

2388
02:40:48,337 --> 02:40:49,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki comes in at about midnight.

2389
02:40:50,539 --> 02:40:52,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, seriously, it's very late night.

2390
02:40:52,341 --> 02:40:54,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at this chatroom statistics page.

2391
02:40:54,322 --> 02:40:54,983
[SPEAKER_16]: He is on there.

2392
02:40:55,003 --> 02:40:56,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Just very late at night.

2393
02:40:57,335 --> 02:41:00,016
[SPEAKER_14]: He's on there at the under 80 posts, I think.

2394
02:41:00,736 --> 02:41:02,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, one of the low posters.

2395
02:41:02,357 --> 02:41:07,358
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, fine, I'm going to post... I think I've seen the channel like twice, okay?

2396
02:41:08,279 --> 02:41:08,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been in there.

2397
02:41:09,299 --> 02:41:10,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in there last night.

2398
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:12,000
[SPEAKER_17]: He's in there more often than I am.

2399
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:15,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm in there more often than all of y'all.

2400
02:41:15,281 --> 02:41:19,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that one time I did the whole, like, you know, I'm making a sim file while I'm chatting thing?

2401
02:41:19,843 --> 02:41:20,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember?

2402
02:41:21,781 --> 02:41:24,183
[SPEAKER_16]: A big thank you, by the way, to all our chatters in the chat room tonight.

2403
02:41:24,203 --> 02:41:25,844
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had a record.

2404
02:41:25,904 --> 02:41:28,305
[SPEAKER_16]: We were pushing 20 people there at one point in the chat room.

2405
02:41:28,345 --> 02:41:31,447
[SPEAKER_16]: So thanks, you guys, for blowing shit up in our chat room.

2406
02:41:31,507 --> 02:41:34,269
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to go in the chat room more often, and so I got scared.

2407
02:41:34,569 --> 02:41:40,092
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the stats, a lot of people are starting to idle more throughout the day and just talk at random points throughout the day.

2408
02:41:40,172 --> 02:41:44,175
[SPEAKER_16]: So just come join our chat room.

2409
02:41:45,424 --> 02:41:53,172
[SPEAKER_14]: For recent accomplishments, I passed many double Onis, because RVGL's Max 2 machine was on free play.

2410
02:41:53,452 --> 02:41:53,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yay.

2411
02:41:54,633 --> 02:42:00,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was on free play, because every Saturday morning, they turn all the machines on free play, and they have to go around to each one by hand.

2412
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:02,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I guess they forgot.

2413
02:42:02,320 --> 02:42:02,701
[SPEAKER_14]: It happens.

2414
02:42:03,201 --> 02:42:05,664
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, I got to beat lots of ones like Tempo Changer and stuff.

2415
02:42:05,684 --> 02:42:06,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It was cool.

2416
02:42:07,586 --> 02:42:07,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

2417
02:42:08,559 --> 02:42:16,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we're going to take another really quick break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to wrap up the show with final thoughts, and maybe another quick topic.

2418
02:42:16,689 --> 02:42:18,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes, Loki, before we go to... Really quick last minute.

2419
02:42:19,011 --> 02:42:20,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of an FU that I forgot earlier.

2420
02:42:21,294 --> 02:42:23,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, boy.

2421
02:42:23,356 --> 02:42:23,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't worry.

2422
02:42:23,717 --> 02:42:24,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2423
02:42:24,938 --> 02:42:26,620
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a big FU to RVTL's...

2424
02:42:27,998 --> 02:42:29,719
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2425
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:51,274
[SPEAKER_16]: and then we will be back so we'll be back very soon

2426
02:43:32,094 --> 02:43:32,314
[SPEAKER_04]: OHA!

2427
02:43:32,514 --> 02:43:32,955
[SPEAKER_04]: OHA!

2428
02:43:33,095 --> 02:43:33,355
[SPEAKER_04]: OHA!

2429
02:44:22,782 --> 02:44:24,623
The early bird gets the worm!

2430
02:44:24,643 --> 02:44:24,843
Yeah!

2431
02:44:24,863 --> 02:44:25,003
Woo!

2432
02:44:25,023 --> 02:44:25,583
Come on!

2433
02:44:25,603 --> 02:44:25,863
Get it!

2434
02:44:44,582 --> 02:44:47,284
Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!

2435
02:44:47,945 --> 02:44:49,986
Make the beat loud, come on, come on, yeah!

2436
02:44:50,026 --> 02:44:53,628
Pump that body, pump that body, come on, come on, yeah!

2437
02:44:53,648 --> 02:44:58,792
Pump that body, pump that body, pump that body, put it, put it, put it, put it on!

2438
02:44:58,892 --> 02:45:00,133
It's time to scream it!

2439
02:45:00,633 --> 02:45:02,214
It's time to scream it!

2440
02:45:02,434 --> 02:45:03,435
It's time to scream it!

2441
02:45:26,046 --> 02:45:27,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Music Music Music

2442
02:46:29,546 --> 02:46:30,347
Thank you for watching!

2443
02:47:53,116 --> 02:47:54,145
Thank you for watching!

2444
02:48:25,319 --> 02:48:26,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2445
02:49:29,864 --> 02:49:36,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

2446
02:49:37,575 --> 02:49:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

2447
02:49:43,857 --> 02:49:45,757
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

2448
02:49:46,317 --> 02:49:50,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

2449
02:50:03,024 --> 02:50:04,466
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to edit that down a little bit.

2450
02:50:04,646 --> 02:50:06,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I actually have an edited down version.

2451
02:50:06,288 --> 02:50:09,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought I burned it on the CD, but that's the CD I listen to in the car, so I guess not.

2452
02:50:10,573 --> 02:50:16,820
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Amanda, which was originally done by the 80s group Boston, and this new version is done by Brooklyn Queens.

2453
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:19,603
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Ford's Transmix and can be found on...

2454
02:50:20,223 --> 02:50:22,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Vic Latino presents 80s Now.

2455
02:50:22,864 --> 02:50:25,306
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a CD that was on sale at Tower, so go check it out.

2456
02:50:25,346 --> 02:50:28,967
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty good, but I'd probably recommend Time After Time, which is the CD I was looking for.

2457
02:50:29,468 --> 02:50:30,248
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2458
02:50:30,268 --> 02:50:31,048
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

2459
02:50:31,309 --> 02:50:31,829
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay.

2460
02:50:32,309 --> 02:50:32,729
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought it.

2461
02:50:33,269 --> 02:50:34,450
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's okay.

2462
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:41,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I was on 80s with a kick after playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, so I just had to get some remixed 80s stuff.

2463
02:50:41,573 --> 02:50:42,334
[SPEAKER_16]: What is up with this...

2464
02:50:42,974 --> 02:51:07,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Grand Theft Auto Vice City, I never played those games, that game, so Dan's store was a fucking nightmare the day that game came out It was full of all stupid people But the CDs, oh my god, the CDs are awesome because they have You know, when you're playing GTA, you can change the station And you have the DJ come up and they say something funny Well, the DJs are on the CDs Introducing some of the tracks The Latina one is absolutely hilarious

2465
02:51:09,708 --> 02:51:11,111
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a new wave one too, which I like.

2466
02:51:14,677 --> 02:51:17,001
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're coming into the final home stretch of the show.

2467
02:51:17,062 --> 02:51:18,805
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought maybe we'd go around and talk about...

2468
02:51:19,583 --> 02:51:21,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Our best Bomani moment of the week.

2469
02:51:22,504 --> 02:51:23,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Of the week?

2470
02:51:23,424 --> 02:51:24,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, of the week.

2471
02:51:24,064 --> 02:51:28,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Jamie hasn't picked up and played 2DX twice this week.

2472
02:51:28,886 --> 02:51:29,586
[SPEAKER_16]: But what did you do?

2473
02:51:30,246 --> 02:51:31,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I passed Fantasy on Light 7.

2474
02:51:31,827 --> 02:51:32,467
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

2475
02:51:32,647 --> 02:51:38,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm always slow on the Bomani games, I will admit it.

2476
02:51:39,269 --> 02:51:42,210
[SPEAKER_17]: But I had been trying to beat Fantasy on Light 7 forever.

2477
02:51:42,330 --> 02:51:44,711
[SPEAKER_17]: It was one of two songs I had left to do on 4th style.

2478
02:51:45,651 --> 02:51:46,972
[SPEAKER_17]: and I've been getting 76, 78, 76, 78.

2479
02:51:48,953 --> 02:51:51,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I beat it with a 90% today, so I'm happy.

2480
02:51:51,615 --> 02:51:52,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Woohoo!

2481
02:51:52,435 --> 02:51:54,736
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm getting there on Get On Beat.

2482
02:51:55,697 --> 02:51:57,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh, yeah!

2483
02:51:57,798 --> 02:51:59,599
[SPEAKER_17]: And I almost beat Voltage today.

2484
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:00,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

2485
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:03,501
[SPEAKER_17]: In 7 key, by the way, not in like 7.

2486
02:52:04,342 --> 02:52:07,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Any Bamani moments of the week you would like to share with us?

2487
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:11,522
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't really do anything other than download shit off the internet.

2488
02:52:12,062 --> 02:52:13,382
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Bomani related.

2489
02:52:13,442 --> 02:52:18,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I downloaded more sim files to add something like 1588 now or something like that.

2490
02:52:19,545 --> 02:52:21,266
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, that's pretty much all I did.

2491
02:52:21,406 --> 02:52:23,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Reorganized my sim stuff.

2492
02:52:24,468 --> 02:52:28,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Updated some of my files with full sets instead of just the partial shit I had.

2493
02:52:29,950 --> 02:52:40,478
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about it, I mean, you know, update my website, you know, fix some links and shit, uh, direct this guy who couldn't speak to, uh, find MP3s, so, like I said.

2494
02:52:41,539 --> 02:52:41,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool!

2495
02:52:44,821 --> 02:52:45,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab, yes.

2496
02:52:46,522 --> 02:52:54,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides the obvious part of me now being a bitch of 2DX6 style, um... And 5th style, and 4th style.

2497
02:52:54,388 --> 02:52:55,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's true.

2498
02:52:56,408 --> 02:52:58,949
[SPEAKER_16]: and ThirdStyle, which didn't have Celebrate.

2499
02:52:58,969 --> 02:53:00,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't find Celebrate.

2500
02:53:00,050 --> 02:53:01,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I just don't have it unlocked yet.

2501
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:01,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

2502
02:53:02,871 --> 02:53:03,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways.

2503
02:53:04,952 --> 02:53:05,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

2504
02:53:06,873 --> 02:53:09,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, I haven't done shit, Beemani-wise.

2505
02:53:10,334 --> 02:53:13,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Haven't been to arcades, haven't been to Tapioca Express to play.

2506
02:53:15,276 --> 02:53:19,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I really didn't play that much Beemani when I went home over the weekend.

2507
02:53:20,879 --> 02:53:22,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And, yeah, I'm deprived.

2508
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:23,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Help me, please.

2509
02:53:26,032 --> 02:53:27,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Jamie has another one she wants to share.

2510
02:53:28,154 --> 02:53:29,575
[SPEAKER_17]: I full comboed Cowgirl.

2511
02:53:30,196 --> 02:53:30,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Rad.

2512
02:53:31,116 --> 02:53:33,898
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy, because gallops are one of my weakest things.

2513
02:53:34,479 --> 02:53:37,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you go over for Boba and you beat it then?

2514
02:53:37,121 --> 02:53:38,582
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this was right after Shaft.

2515
02:53:38,622 --> 02:53:41,164
[SPEAKER_17]: I was damn tired, exhausted, and hardly got to eat anything.

2516
02:53:41,684 --> 02:53:46,668
[SPEAKER_17]: So right before they were going to take the machine off of event mode, I was like, fuck all of you, I'm going to play, okay?

2517
02:53:46,728 --> 02:53:53,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn it, I've been running back and forth just so that you people could have a good time, which I'm glad everyone did, and I was really happy.

2518
02:53:53,908 --> 02:53:55,309
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna play DDR, hell.

2519
02:53:55,669 --> 02:53:57,271
[SPEAKER_17]: So I played Cowgirl, and I full combo'd it.

2520
02:53:57,531 --> 02:53:57,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Ownage.

2521
02:53:58,151 --> 02:54:00,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I was dead tired, and then I went home and took Vicodin.

2522
02:54:02,775 --> 02:54:03,715
[SPEAKER_16]: You took some drugs.

2523
02:54:04,676 --> 02:54:05,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's for 13 hours.

2524
02:54:06,457 --> 02:54:08,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually don't know why I came up with this.

2525
02:54:08,118 --> 02:54:09,479
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any Bimani news to report.

2526
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:10,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I barely played any at all.

2527
02:54:11,301 --> 02:54:12,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I played a little 2DX.

2528
02:54:12,362 --> 02:54:13,643
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't passed shit new.

2529
02:54:13,683 --> 02:54:15,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still stuck at the same point I was.

2530
02:54:16,465 --> 02:54:16,485
[SPEAKER_16]: I...

2531
02:54:17,625 --> 02:54:24,489
[SPEAKER_16]: I keep fucking up the last few measures of V, otherwise I could pass the goddamn song on 7-key.

2532
02:54:25,150 --> 02:54:27,311
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't really passed anything else.

2533
02:54:27,331 --> 02:54:28,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm getting closer to DXY.

2534
02:54:28,652 --> 02:54:30,333
[SPEAKER_16]: That's about it, personally.

2535
02:54:31,193 --> 02:54:32,934
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I guess that's about it.

2536
02:54:32,954 --> 02:54:34,675
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got only a few minutes left in the show.

2537
02:54:34,815 --> 02:54:36,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go around and get everybody's final... Where's Dave?

2538
02:54:36,996 --> 02:54:37,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Get Dave in here.

2539
02:54:37,457 --> 02:54:38,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get his final thought.

2540
02:54:42,518 --> 02:54:45,641
[SPEAKER_16]: What did he pass?

2541
02:54:45,921 --> 02:54:47,903
[SPEAKER_11]: He says he passed Presto, yay.

2542
02:54:48,484 --> 02:54:49,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, that's impressive.

2543
02:54:49,985 --> 02:54:53,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so let's talk about everybody's final thought for today.

2544
02:54:54,269 --> 02:54:55,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, your final thought.

2545
02:54:55,150 --> 02:54:55,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go final.

2546
02:54:56,491 --> 02:54:56,731
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2547
02:54:56,751 --> 02:54:57,552
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go final.

2548
02:54:57,872 --> 02:54:58,433
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll go final.

2549
02:54:59,373 --> 02:55:00,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your final thought.

2550
02:55:02,196 --> 02:55:06,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely be watching the Fry's ads because they've been having a lot of good stuff really cheap lately.

2551
02:55:06,819 --> 02:55:16,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you can't beat... If I didn't want to stick with the name brand Yamaha, I could have gone with the verbatim CD-R burner for $19, a 40-speed CD burner.

2552
02:55:17,007 --> 02:55:18,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just put it this way.

2553
02:55:18,208 --> 02:55:21,150
[SPEAKER_15]: 40-speed... I put my shoes on today while I was burning a CD.

2554
02:55:21,210 --> 02:55:24,873
[SPEAKER_15]: The CD burner finished burning my CD before my shoes were on.

2555
02:55:25,433 --> 02:55:27,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's just crazy shit right there.

2556
02:55:28,195 --> 02:55:30,357
[SPEAKER_15]: So, definitely check that stuff out.

2557
02:55:30,457 --> 02:55:31,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Watch my site later this week.

2558
02:55:31,878 --> 02:55:34,581
[SPEAKER_15]: There should be some updates, I hope, if I get around to it.

2559
02:55:34,841 --> 02:55:35,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been kind of busy.

2560
02:55:36,222 --> 02:55:37,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And, yeah, that kind of shit.

2561
02:55:38,164 --> 02:55:39,065
[SPEAKER_15]: So, watch that.

2562
02:55:39,185 --> 02:55:42,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Look for TourneyMix because you're going to have a lot of cool files to download there.

2563
02:55:42,267 --> 02:55:44,650
[SPEAKER_15]: And, yeah, just that kind of stuff.

2564
02:55:44,690 --> 02:55:45,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Have fun.

2565
02:55:47,252 --> 02:55:48,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab, your final thought for today?

2566
02:55:50,034 --> 02:55:50,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me think.

2567
02:55:51,636 --> 02:55:51,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2568
02:55:53,092 --> 02:55:56,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a paper due tomorrow morning that I need to finish when I get home.

2569
02:55:56,473 --> 02:55:56,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Slacker.

2570
02:55:58,054 --> 02:55:58,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm right, I am.

2571
02:56:00,215 --> 02:56:01,355
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, let's see.

2572
02:56:01,836 --> 02:56:07,778
[SPEAKER_16]: The next time Twin says Mac suck, I'm gonna go down to Florida and take one of those puck mice from the early IMAX and shove it up his ass.

2573
02:56:09,639 --> 02:56:11,599
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't wanna go to that area.

2574
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:14,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't wanna know about things going up Twin's ass.

2575
02:56:16,421 --> 02:56:18,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I mean, uh, I don't know.

2576
02:56:19,102 --> 02:56:19,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Mac?

2577
02:56:19,363 --> 02:56:19,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob!

2578
02:56:20,783 --> 02:56:22,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not done with my final thought yet, dammit.

2579
02:56:24,112 --> 02:56:24,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it.

2580
02:56:26,635 --> 02:56:28,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it, you made me forget what I was going to say.

2581
02:56:29,677 --> 02:56:30,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrong text.

2582
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:32,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

2583
02:56:33,961 --> 02:56:34,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I had fun tonight.

2584
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:35,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Go meet.

2585
02:56:37,365 --> 02:56:37,565
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2586
02:56:38,706 --> 02:56:39,546
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Loki, you're done.

2587
02:56:42,089 --> 02:56:42,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let him talk.

2588
02:56:42,830 --> 02:56:43,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

2589
02:56:44,897 --> 02:56:53,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Expect some more Guitar Freak's 7th and 8th music and also popping music stuff to be appearing in our playlist later this week.

2590
02:56:53,579 --> 02:56:53,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Check it out.

2591
02:56:54,099 --> 02:56:54,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2592
02:56:55,080 --> 02:57:01,161
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually already have some 8th and 7th in there, but popping music, per that email, we finally, we ordered our albums and we got them.

2593
02:57:01,701 --> 02:57:02,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Wink wink.

2594
02:57:02,742 --> 02:57:05,762
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll be adding the popping music stuff like we promised we would this week.

2595
02:57:06,402 --> 02:57:10,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Paula Tanberry's, the Paula Terry band is over now.

2596
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:11,424
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no it's not.

2597
02:57:11,624 --> 02:57:12,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we're going to ban her for another week?

2598
02:57:13,564 --> 02:57:14,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Banner for a month.

2599
02:57:15,144 --> 02:57:16,185
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll banner until next year.

2600
02:57:16,425 --> 02:57:18,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so Politary's banned for the rest of the year.

2601
02:57:21,866 --> 02:57:27,588
[SPEAKER_16]: And my final thought is, I still need a date, but it looks like I might have one this week, so that's cool.

2602
02:57:29,129 --> 02:57:30,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up.

2603
02:57:30,789 --> 02:57:33,070
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess that's it.

2604
02:57:33,170 --> 02:57:34,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to go play DDR because I'm getting fat.

2605
02:57:35,230 --> 02:57:37,431
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't like being fat.

2606
02:57:38,251 --> 02:57:38,571
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

2607
02:57:39,052 --> 02:57:39,432
[SPEAKER_16]: My turn.

2608
02:57:39,532 --> 02:57:40,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, your final thought.

2609
02:57:43,175 --> 02:57:43,595
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

2610
02:57:43,856 --> 02:57:44,316
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it?

2611
02:57:44,356 --> 02:57:49,640
[SPEAKER_16]: That's your final thought?

2612
02:57:49,740 --> 02:57:51,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess Dave doesn't have a final thought.

2613
02:57:51,141 --> 02:57:51,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave loses.

2614
02:57:51,961 --> 02:57:53,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Dave doesn't have a single thought in his head.

2615
02:57:53,682 --> 02:57:54,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave doesn't have a thought in his head.

2616
02:57:57,385 --> 02:57:57,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave's final thought.

2617
02:57:58,025 --> 02:57:58,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, Dave and Presto.

2618
02:57:58,866 --> 02:57:59,546
[SPEAKER_16]: That was his final thought.

2619
02:57:59,566 --> 02:58:02,448
[SPEAKER_16]: So what did you guys think of... Oh god.

2620
02:58:03,129 --> 02:58:03,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Here he comes.

2621
02:58:05,630 --> 02:58:06,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I passed Presto.

2622
02:58:06,711 --> 02:58:07,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

2623
02:58:07,832 --> 02:58:08,832
[SPEAKER_16]: I already said that.

2624
02:58:08,892 --> 02:58:09,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Get out of here.

2625
02:58:09,393 --> 02:58:11,114
[SPEAKER_16]: You're banned with Politary.

2626
02:58:12,634 --> 02:58:14,695
[SPEAKER_17]: We're locking Impolitary in the closet.

2627
02:58:15,296 --> 02:58:15,556
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2628
02:58:16,417 --> 02:58:18,838
[SPEAKER_16]: You and Impolitary are getting locked in the closet.

2629
02:58:19,038 --> 02:58:24,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Coming next week... Coming next week is Impolitary Upskirt Cam.

2630
02:58:24,882 --> 02:58:25,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Exclusive.

2631
02:58:25,462 --> 02:58:25,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

2632
02:58:27,464 --> 02:58:32,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, I went to open my closet and there was Impolitary with an underage American.

2633
02:58:32,927 --> 02:58:36,370
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that cracker boy doing in my closet, you might ask?

2634
02:58:36,890 --> 02:58:39,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that will be in my next week's diary.

2635
02:58:40,112 --> 02:58:41,353
[SPEAKER_16]: So what did you guys think of the three hour show?

2636
02:58:41,894 --> 02:58:43,455
[SPEAKER_17]: That three hour trainwreck.

2637
02:58:45,175 --> 02:58:48,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I was very disappointed there was no Gilligan's Island music in the intro.

2638
02:58:49,697 --> 02:58:51,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought about it, but that's so cliche.

2639
02:58:51,717 --> 02:58:54,258
[SPEAKER_16]: I promoted it as a three hour tour, so that was about it.

2640
02:58:54,979 --> 02:58:55,919
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you think of three hours?

2641
02:58:58,020 --> 02:59:00,280
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a hell of a lot better when you're actually in here.

2642
02:59:01,861 --> 02:59:02,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2643
02:59:02,801 --> 02:59:09,664
[SPEAKER_16]: And even though it's kind of a small room, it's a hell of a lot better sitting down on my computer and my ass getting numb from not moving.

2644
02:59:11,549 --> 02:59:17,791
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have been better if we had a lot more Belmani news going on, but since everyone is kind of like, eh, nope.

2645
02:59:18,192 --> 02:59:20,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we'll get out and do some interviews this week, so we'll have something to talk about next week.

2646
02:59:20,913 --> 02:59:22,493
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to take care of the interviews from Shaft.

2647
02:59:22,733 --> 02:59:24,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we're going to try and get that at some point.

2648
02:59:25,935 --> 02:59:29,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very scared of the best of tape that you're going to put together here.

2649
