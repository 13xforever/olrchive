1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh! Message for you, son! Attention! Do you wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this episode...

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
About the biggest fairy you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Showgirls.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Absolute frightful.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's yours?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now's the time on Scrockets, then we dance!

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know kung fu.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect for Spanish exercise is kendo.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, hey, hey!

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark Sakurai.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Shut up!

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sky.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Orange Lounge Radio

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We are live, and this is episode number 24, November the 17th of 2002.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But not November 20th.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It is our second season premiere!

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Woo!

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yay!

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then we're supposed to do a thing.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yay!

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's like fall sweeps.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's sweeps week.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,760
In this episode, Jamie is going to get married.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
I don't!

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Fuck you!

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,560
And Loki is going to have a baby.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
No.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:14,480
You are tuned in to the Bemani Scene's most premiered radio station of all things Bemani.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,680
My name is Rob Roberts and you might know me as Sky.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Summers.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Of course, as always, because we just can't get rid of him, it's Dave!

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Hello!

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
He's our favorite little pest.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Alright, we'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,680
and this break is going to feature some second songs, like Second Mix, Second Style, and all sorts of things like that,

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
because it is the second season of Orange Lounge.

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Or do you just have to go number two?

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes, I'm going to go take a big poopy right now. On your head!

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
AHH!

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Uh, we'll be right back to talk about, uh, a lot of stuff, and maybe something about DDR, I don't know. We'll see.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
DDR? Who plays that anymore?

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,680
I don't know, DRSK. Alright, see you in a little bit.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Is this love and love for me?

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Cause when we dance together

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,680
You're like a dream come true

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,680
I feel so beautiful

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Heart and sight

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Resolve those of you

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Love, I just gotta have it all

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I believe in love

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I can't be without it

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Come to me and make your confession

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Love, come let it go

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Love, I just gotta have it

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
I believe in love

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
I can't be without it

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Come to me and make your confession

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,660
Da!

74
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,520
Go Magic!

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Let's go!

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Oh,

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,520
oh,

78
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,520
oh,

79
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,520
oh,

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Love, love, love, love, love, love

81
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

82
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,520
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are.

83
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
We.

84
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
We, a little bit earlier than usual.

85
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,520
So that's the new game here, 6.30 to 9.30.

86
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
We're so bored and have nothing to do.

87
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah, we thought we'd share our boredom with the rest of you.

88
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,960
It's Java, and Twen helped me out to figure out how we get a Java thing going, so thank

89
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
you to Twen too.

90
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
But I'm not going to kiss Twen.

91
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
No.

92
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Oh, my phone's ringing!

93
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
That's my ringer.

94
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
My bad.

95
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm not answering it on air, sorry.

96
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,080
You should turn off your cell phone when we're on air.

97
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
That's my booty call.

98
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Uh oh, Rob's got his booty call.

99
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Wail.

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,120
Well, so the chat room right now, they're trying to get me to go to Vegas.

101
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,680
They want us, I think they want all of us to come to Vegas, really, to do a show on

102
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
the road in Vegas.

103
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Okay, are you going to pay?

104
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Yeah, I know.

105
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
How are we going to...

106
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,740
Well, I know that my buddy Irene, Rice Princess, she turned 21 this weekend, so now she's thinking

107
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,040
about doing a Vegas trip, because it was supposed to be Reno this weekend.

108
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
We were all going to go to Reno.

109
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,560
Prostitution is legal in Vegas, right?

110
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,300
Prostitution is not legal in Vegas or Vegas County, I don't think.

111
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
outside it is.

112
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
It sucks.

113
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm sorry?

114
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Isn't it legal in Nevada in general?

115
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,700
Yes, but certain cities have it.

116
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,660
There's like some big brothel that's right outside.

117
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,220
Mustang Ranch.

118
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,560
It's Mustang Ranch, man.

119
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,500
I remember the one time on Under Station Live, the show I used to do on Saturday nights,

120
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,780
we actually called the Bunny Ranch and got an interview with some prostitutes at the

121
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Bunny Ranch.

122
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
It's a great radio.

123
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,440
Maybe once we get that capability set up here we can...

124
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
You want to interview some prostitutes, Jamie?

125
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Sure.

126
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,940
What's it like to be a whore?

127
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,320
You are a whore, darling.

128
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,840
Speaking of whores, we watched, I made Jamie watch the best movie about Vegas that's ever

129
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,880
been made, Showgirls, the motion picture.

130
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,740
Three hours of stripping crap, it's so bad.

131
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,120
That's why it is fun to watch, because it is so freaking horrible.

132
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,920
What's our, what's our fuck from Saved by the Bell?

133
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,560
Jessie Spano was her, well it's Elizabeth Berkley is her real name, but she was Jessie

134
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
Spano on Saved by the Bell.

135
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,440
She was most famous in one episode, which Spazzy, I don't know if he's listening right

136
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,680
now, but he was trying to send me an episode of this, and it's been sending like all night

137
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
long.

138
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,800
He was sending me an episode of Saved by the Bell when Jessie has her caffeine pill addiction,

139
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
and she breaks down.

140
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
I'm so excited!

141
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm so excited!

142
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm so scared!

143
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,180
scared

144
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,280

151
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,740
who's running a radio station out of his house

152
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,660
Hey, fuck you! Not me, I'm just visiting. You're here, bastard.

153
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,820
That's all I have to say.

154
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,220
Yeah, there, we got people in the chat room admitting that they used to watch that show.

155
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,780
I didn't watch Shaved by the Bell, because I think I was busy watching cartoons.

156
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,860
What cartoons were you watching instead of Saved by the Bell? Saved by the Bell came on after all the cartoons.

157
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,980
I was taping Ronan Warriors in the morning while I was still asleep, and then watching my tape when I got home

158
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,860
in the afternoon after I watched all my other shows. Well, aren't you special?

159
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,320
yes i am quite

160
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,580

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,100
which is what she was she on now she's on some show and i was on my

165
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,580
she's on the two and i will tell you that i mean that she's like

166
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,540
in big parts of the movies

167
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,180
uh...

168
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,820
which means she's pretty much top was a lot of them right

169
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,720
no actually now

170
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Uh, the last movie I remember seeing her in was, um, what was it, uh, Shriek, if I know what you did last Friday the 13th.

171
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,620
Wasn't she, wasn't she in, um, uh, one of the Dust Till Dawn sequels, too?

172
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,620
You know, I don't like to acknowledge the Dust Till Dawn sequels.

173
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,920
I mean, okay, okay. Now, granted, number two did have Bruce Campbell in, so that made number two decent.

174
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,620
Ha!

175
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
I have to see that, then.

176
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,720
Bruce Campbell was in Sacramento last week, by the way.

177
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,420
What?

178
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,420
Yes, Bruce Campbell did a signing at Borders or something. I just heard about it, like, last minute.

179
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,420
That's alright. We saw him when he went to the Crest and did a...

180
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
No.

181
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
We saw Evil Dead there.

182
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Yes.

183
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,420
My friend has himself on videotape with Bruce Campbell at E3.

184
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Cool.

185
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
What was Bruce Campbell doing at E3?

186
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
They released that game, but he was there...

187
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Well, it was the year before. He was there for that Evil Dead game that was on Dreamcast. It was really shitty.

188
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,420
And then he was there last year, again, just signing stuff.

189
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Oh, just because he's Bruce Campbell.

190
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Well, we saw him when he was down at the Crest Theater and it was pretty cool because he

191
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,420
was doing signings and stuff and then they did a screening of You Let Too, Dead by Dawn,

192
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
which was great.

193
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,420
Great movie.

194
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,420
It's really fun to watch in a theater full of people, especially people I've seen the

195
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,420
movie for, because everyone's just all cheering at the right spots.

196
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
And he's like, tool shed!

197
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
And everyone's like, YEAH!

198
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Why can't we get a screening of Showgirls at the Crest with Elizabeth Berkley live, and the chick who played the mama at the strip bar who had the...

199
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,420
She'd go like that and her top would fly off and she was really ugly.

200
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Chicken bump on you.

201
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh, no, not the big fat chick. I'm talking Elizabeth Berkley.

202
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Hey, if we want to recreate through the scenes of the movie...

203
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Elizabeth Berkley looks like a skank. Ew.

204
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Looks like a duck. Looks like my sister. Quacks like a duck, must be a duck.

205
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You don't care. You can put a paper bag on her head.

206
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Hey, don't ruin it.

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Last week, by the way, if you missed it, we talked about Loki's wide collection of porn. Which reminds me, how's the contest coming?

208
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,420
Would you like to make an announcement on the new contest, Make Edit Get Porn?

209
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,060
get porn yes it's an actual real contest now

210
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,060
you basically you make an edit for any song that appears on ddrmax USA

211
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,200
and you send that edit to me in any form

212
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,740
i mean you can make the edit with the japanese version of

213
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,880
a ddr game that happens to have the same song that you know is in ddrmax USA

214
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,620
dwi you make an sm file just some

215
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,420
some way to get step chart

216
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
some way to get it to me

217
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,940
and then you know i'll take care of the rest and send you out a big box of porn

218
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,860
that's that's how it works

219
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,480
i tried proposing this to the

220
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,980
ddr maniacs uh... forms and it just didn't get there

221
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,820
i like the idea of an edit contest but why porn?

222
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
because i've done other edit contests before and they're like

223
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,860
but why porn? because everything else has been done! they're okay and you do a normal edit

224
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,160
i want boys. well sorry i don't have that

225
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,100
we will find a way to maybe donate some boy porn to the contest we'll see if we

226
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,380
can figure something out. We don't know if we'll have DVDs necessarily, but we'll get

227
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,420
boy porn in one way or another, just for the ladies, okay?

228
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,460
Alright, well anyways... Oh, go ahead, Dave.

229
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,940
Instead of, like, getting boy porn for the winner, how about just donate boy porn to

230
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,860
Jamie, because I don't think anyone else, including me, would want boy porn.

231
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:40,300
Now, now, we're neglecting some locals like Anita, DDRholic, RicePrincess... I don't know,

232
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,660
there's folks out there that might want boy porn, who knows?

233
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,380
i don't get it if you know guys

234
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,820
talk about you know

235
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,180
just all-girl porn you know

236
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,460
like here we have our all-boy porn

237
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,720
i'm not saying that you can understand it

238
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,220
what would you want girl porn like girl on coral

239
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,280
girl on girl action

240
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,500
because homosexuality is wrong and bags go to hell but being lesbians okay

241
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,700
i don't

242
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,020
fake body parts okay

243
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,260
to be that attractive. I like seeing pretty boys with nice abs.

244
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,680
They're not fake, they're enhanced.

245
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,040
I'll have you know those are ab implants, okay?

246
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,500
Now, but anyways,

247
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,040
if I got free guy porn, then sure, I'd throw in free guy porn, but I just get free girl porn,

248
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,140
so uh...

249
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,300
that's what's going in the box.

250
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,200
Um, but yeah, they just, no one could understand why I was doing a contest to get

251
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
porn, and I was like, because it's funny. Because it's porn! Because it's fun!

252
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm all, they're all, why don't you do a normal contest with regular prizes?

253
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,360
So first I like, I kind of caved for about a minute, and I said, ah fuck them.

254
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,360
You want a normal edit contest, go enter turn a mix three or whatever.

255
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,360
This is a pornographic edit contest. It's called make edit get porn, not make edit get something not porn.

256
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,360
I should have made that rule that all the titles for the edits have to be sexually ambiguous.

257
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Pr0n

258
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Pr0n

259
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I wanted Pr0n to go to freaking like, you know...

260
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,360
If JB, it's like JB wins it, he'll uh, he'll try to deep fry it and you'll have deep fried Pr0n

261
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,360
No, but seriously, there'll be quite a bit of stuff in this box here

262
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,360
That might be the slight problem though

263
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Obviously, this contest is only open for anyone of age that can view porn in your state or county.

264
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
As long as, if you enter, I am assuming that you are of age and that you're...

265
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
You're convincing enough to lie about it.

266
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Yes. If you enter, I am assuming that you're of age. Do not tell me otherwise. It's don't ask, don't tell.

267
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,360
If you cannot have pornography mailed to your house, don't enter. Don't.

268
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Remember, when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.

269
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Yes, and we're not talking about a little bit of porn, we're talking a lot of porn, so this is gonna, you gotta, we'll arrange, you know, transportation of the porn to your house, but we'll arrange a nice brown paper bag.

270
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes, like not a little bit of porn, like a whole two and a half days worth of porn. That's a lot.

271
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
It will paint a little green door on the package.

272
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
package.

273
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,440
Anyways, yeah, so the contest is still on. I have no entrance yet, but I haven't even

274
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,240
announced a date for it, so. So, I mean, you know, whenever, I'll think of a date. In the

275
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,980
meantime, just get your edits ready and, yeah.

276
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,320
Even though a lot of people aren't entering, like, haven't signed up or whatever for entering,

277
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,160
I know that there is a lot of hype going on, especially within the Sackpamani forums about

278
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,160
about people wanting to enter this, such as Orange Beanie, and me, and other people.

279
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,160
This isn't restricted just to Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Sacramento. It's everybody.

280
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Nationwide, international, international. If you live in Belgium and you want prawn, enter.

281
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,160
As long as you have the right region for your DVD player or a good hack.

282
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh yeah, that's a good point though, because they're all U.S. region DVDs.

283
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm going to have to actually limit it to the continental United States.

284
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Oh, okay. What about Canada?

285
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Yeah, it's just it gets a little expensive ship stuff to other countries.

286
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Oh, that's true. Continental US then only.

287
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Continental US, yes.

288
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Maybe if somebody internationally wants to enter, maybe we'll just send you some net porn.

289
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
We'll send you a few dirty pictures.

290
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I'll arrange something, yeah, for those who can't do that.

291
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I actually found, you know this is really sad,

292
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,660
Is someone made Nintendo 64 emulated porn?

293
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,600
A Nintendo 64 porn? What is that, Mario Party or something?

294
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,420
No, it's just like, I don't know, it's like they made a ROM file with porn in it. It was weird.

295
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,740
Wahoo!

296
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,540
They have those for Super Nintendo.

297
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:04,200
There's like 30 pictures of them. I downloaded this ROM that was labeled as this game I wanted and it was porn.

298
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,460
Cool!

299
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,140
It was like big, you know, twat shot porn.

300
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,940
Ew!

301
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,940
You need to see pixelated cooter, okay?

302
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,940
Plus, add an option.

303
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,940
I guess what it does is activates the rumble pack for a very long time.

304
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,940
What?

305
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,940
So that was really weird, but yeah.

306
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
It's out there.

307
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,940
You have no idea how many times I click on something for Kazaa.

308
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
It's like, Initial D, episode 22.

309
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Oh, wait, that's not Initial D. That looks like porn.

310
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,180
Not Initial D. Yeah, that pissed me off. I was trying to find Jackass, the movie.

311
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
I ended up getting Sorority Boys.

312
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,660
Yeah, then you see the male ass.

313
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
I was like, no!

314
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,700
Of course I'm downloading Chamber of Secrets right now.

315
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,180
I didn't get to go today.

316
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,100
Oh, you and your Harry Potter. Speaking of porn...

317
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,180
Just kidding.

318
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,240
Speaking of porn, Harry Potter, come on!

319
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,000
well i don't know i don't want to know if you know where to get to the g

320
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,120
how was harry potter anyway very very good

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,400
we're planning on having a trip again to go see it sometime very soon if you want

322
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,920
to come

323
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,400
and join in on the action

324
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,560
need ruling over alan rickman on-screen

325
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,640
okay alan rickman on he was so

326
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,540

327
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,260
Yeah, Harry Potter word.

328
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Oh, speaking of...

329
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,060
Go from porn to Harry Potter!

330
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,140
Speaking of pornography, you know I have something that still goes along the lines of pornography.

331
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,660
This has kind of been circulating a lot of the web boards this week.

332
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,940
We've been given this link that talks about the DDR up the skirt camera.

333
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
I don't know if you guys...

334
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,300
I'll post the link in the chat room for those that maybe haven't seen this, although I think

335
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,660
it's been hoarded out on just about every forum out there.

336
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
But just in case...

337
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,980
Not to mention there's at least five live journals.

338
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,580
Yeah, like different live journals and such.

339
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,020
But just in case, there's the link in the chatroom for you guys.

340
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,340
It's basically a pornography where it shows these Japanese schoolgirls, of course they're

341
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,620
dressed like Catholic schoolgirls, you wouldn't have it any other way.

342
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,080
And yeah, they all look like Sailor Moon.

343
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,460
And there's a little camera right in the center of a DDR pad that films up their skirt.

344
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,980
They even have a diagram illustrating where the camera is.

345
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,340
Yeah, it just like points out, you know, insert camera here.

346
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,780
It's a big black dot.

347
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,780
We should translate this page, shouldn't we? I should run this through the translator because I haven't done that yet. Let's see.

348
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,780
What do you guys think of this while I get translated?

349
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:46,780
I think this is the fakest thing I've ever seen in my life. Obviously all these girls have been paid to do the dancing, but what do you guys think?

350
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Well, they were probably paid to play the game, but they may not have known about the camera, even though it'd be kind of blatantly obvious to anyone that knows the game that there's a large black dot in the middle of the pad. It's like, why is that thing looking up at me?

351
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
No, I would think...

352
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,780
Take a picture so the girl's looking at the camera.

353
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,780
You could probably hide it under there pretty well.

354
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,780
You'd have to do it really well, and I don't think it's really that worth it.

355
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Let's see. This is the English translation of the website. Should we do some reading of the English translation of the website here?

356
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Go for it.

357
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Alright, I'm trying to get some website reading music here.

358
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Yeah, but I just don't see how, like, I mean I can think of that you could hide the camera pretty well, but how many girls wear, like, miniskirts and play? I don't think I've ever seen a girl wear a skirt or a miniskirt and play.

359
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Alright, let's hear what this PornCam site's advertising here.

360
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,780
I was, like, the guy's all ogling at the screen.

361
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Uh, it says, make it wait.

362
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,280
Ah, carry it out.

363
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,180
A playwoman, quantity students, lower half of the body,

364
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,260
collection of images of a shock.

365
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,660
The fourth cartridge, a ban is removed at last.

366
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,660
This time, it photographs before the first game in series,

367
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,380
and photography is ventured.

368
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,880
What?

369
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,620
Surrender, women, quantity student

370
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,220
with sufficient super qua.

371
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,420
Lump, teabag, photography, a success.

372
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,060
Let's hear it for Nistia Globalgate.

373
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,660
The woman quantity students aimed at this time

374
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,300
total six sets.

375
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,980
It clicks on each lower photograph

376
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,940
and is to a verification page.

377
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,380
I don't know if that's letting me do.

378
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,900
Yeah.

379
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,700
Oh, close ups.

380
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,860
Look.

381
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Let's see. K.O., the woman who shows splendid dancing, like, while swaying the flare.

382
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,860
It seems to be the dance of a proposal of marriage completely.

383
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Okay, well let me just put it this way. They haven't been playing DDR very long since they got some serious rolls on that ass.

384
00:25:52,860 --> 00:26:01,860
The whiter panties to the upper one of the leg extended smoothly, which seemed to be

385
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
warm.

386
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,080
It is a fortunate shot.

387
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,060
Is it noticed that a camera is, Japanese, is an exciting moment?

388
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,100
She's looking right down at the camera.

389
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,280
A super-mini and loose exquisite balance and snow-white panties cannot be removed too.

390
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
You want to hear something very ironic about this whole thing?

391
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,280
There's no way that they wouldn't show anything other than a panty shot because it's illegal to show anything like that in Japan in the first place.

392
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
It totally blows up.

393
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Doesn't this look like a cooter right there?

394
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
This chick's not wearing underwear?

395
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Is it just the lighting?

396
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
No, I can't click on it.

397
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Let's see, I'm trying to look at more verification page, see if we can see some...

398
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Oh, I don't know.

399
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,280
just

400
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Why would you want shit?

401
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I still don't think of you at first

402
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
My family's a concern

403
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
What do you point me at?

404
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Oh, the link. Oh, it's a Shockwave file. I don't know what I'm going to get.

405
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Let's see. Okay, so that's enough of that.

406
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Let's click on this Shockwave file I've been getting.

407
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,280
So, any chance we'll ever see a series like this in America?

408
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Panty Panty Revolution?

409
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I don't know about that, but I'm sure that they can, you know, put the girls gone wild chicks on there jumping around and that, you know.

410
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Just take a DDR machine and Mardi Gras.

411
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
And let fun ensue.

412
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I see profits!

413
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Anyways.

414
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,280
I have no idea what this is that I just got in the chat room.

415
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
It's a fish with legs.

416
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
It's a fish with legs and it's speaking a lot of Japanese.

417
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,280
There's a kitty eating a fried egg!

418
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Thank you, Kikoman!

419
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Show me, show you!

420
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,280
They look like little kittens. They look like fried kittens.

421
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,280
1. Soy Sauce 2. Iced Rice

422
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,280
3. Iced Rice

423
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,280
4. Soy Sauce

424
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,280
5. Soy Sauce

425
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
6. Soy Sauce

426
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:50,280
kinko man, kinko man, show me, show you, kinko man, right, right, kinko man, kinko man,

427
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Ice cream pops in the wiener!

428
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,280
You probably have to get the girls drunk first.

429
00:30:50,280 --> 00:31:00,640
little bit like DDR in the nude Jesus I would think so how would it painful

430
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,560
floppy floppy floppy if you got if you're a woman and you have big boobs

431
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,920
you'd be whacking yourself in the face I don't want once me and Paul over like

432
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,680
one of the first times I played I went down to uh I don't know the Riptide

433
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,120
arcade the old one before it was the Riptide arcade or whatever the old place

434
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,760
And there was this one girl who was playing, and her boobs were bouncing up and down so

435
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
much.

436
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,880
It was like Jiggle Jiggle Revolution, I think we called it.

437
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,240
I need to go throw up now.

438
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
I think I saw a freestyle like that the other day.

439
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
I need to go throw up a lot now.

440
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
Are we going to take a quick break and come back?

441
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Yeah, let's take a quick break.

442
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,080
Okay, we're going to take a really quick break, and we'll come right back, and when we come

443
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,360
back, we'll get off the pornography subject, ha ha ha ha, yeah right, and we'll talk to

444
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Black Lab a little more, because he's our special guest, so we have to interview him

445
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,720
while he's here. So, I'm going to get to a request that we had in the chatroom a little

446
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,000
bit earlier. This is from 2Dx8style. It's the super special Secret Stage at Xenon, right

447
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:10,000
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

448
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh

449
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's the seed of my heart, what you feel deep inside

450
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And it means you better stay behind

451
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's the death of your soul, that you tried to relieve

452
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Never until your body functions

453
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Feel it, feel it, baby

454
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Feel the fire, it's coming deep inside me

455
00:38:37,000 --> 00:39:02,320
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, tune in to hear live train wreck radio.

Are you ready?

463

You are listening to OrangeLawn's radio.

POMU is pop and music.

486
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,320
If you're just now joining us, a friendly reminder, Orange Lounge Season 2 debuted tonight

487
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,840
and we start the show a half hour earlier now and we run it a half hour later, which

488
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Which means it's three hours long. No, the webcam is not on.

489
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Okay, because people would be looking at my feet right now.

490
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Uh, the big show starts now at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

491
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
So wake up earlier.

492
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Yes. Get your ass here earlier.

493
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Hi, Black Lab. How are you?

494
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Let's talk to Black Lab.

495
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
It's our favorite puppy.

496
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Yeah.

497
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Good puppy.

498
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Sit.

499
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Sit, Ubu. Sit.

500
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm already on the ground, dammit.

501
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,880
Yes, because you can't have my chair.

502
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,480
Black Lab's already sitting here on his knees.

503
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,600
Don't go there.

504
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,360
Don't go there.

505
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,840
So you've been listening since what?

506
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,960
About the first episode of Orange Lounge, right?

507
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,080
Or a little later, right?

508
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,600
A little later.

509
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,280
I started listening, I think, episode six.

510
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,880
And then I went in the chat room like two weeks after that.

511
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,200
I've been whoring out the series.

512
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,680
Yes.

513
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, you're a walking billboard for Orange Lounge.

514
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,640
We appreciate that.

515
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,120
So, now you most notably might be known because you used to work at one of the many golf lands,

516
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
yes?

517
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,760
Yes, I had my experience working at Castro Valley Golf Land, and I know it's small, and

518
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,200
I know most people consider it ghetto, because Milpitas and Sunnyvale are much bigger, living

519
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
in the ghetto.

520
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,040
Well, it's not really ghetto, it's more like, well, it's Castro Valley.

521
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
It's the hood.

522
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,040
It's like a white and partially Latino hood.

523
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Okay.

524
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,040
And it's up in the hills, it's not like down in the city area.

525
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
It's not even a real city though.

526
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,040
So, what kind of Bamonians do they have at Castro Valley?

527
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Oh, we have the usual standard Max IIs.

528
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Oh, we have a 3rd Korean, yeah!

529
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
Don't see many of those anymore.

530
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
And then we also have a 4th Plus.

531
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh yeah, a US version of Guitar Freaks and a beat stage vidmix, which is with a discolored

532
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,680
screen I might add.

533
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,760
What exactly did you used to do at Castor Valley Golf League?

534
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
You weren't a tech.

535
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
You just...

536
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I was...

537
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
You were a jizmo?

538
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
General...

539
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
I was general maintenance.

540
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,360
I made sure the place didn't collapse on itself.

541
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Oh, I see.

542
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,120
Now were you there for the big tournament they did at Castor Valley a couple months

543
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
ago?

544
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Yeah.

545
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,360
Oh, yes I was, as a matter of fact.

546
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Most people probably don't know this.

547
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,640
If it weren't for me, that whole thing would have fallen flat on its frickin' face.

548
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Oh, I see. Ego, ego. No, I'm serious though. I was like the main link to the management

549
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,760
and it kind of got screwed over at the last minute without my knowledge because I was

550
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,640
trying to make sure that the machine would be going outside for the tournament, but no,

551
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,300
the manager changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to tell anyone until the next

552
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,160
morning when I'm there an hour before the place even opens to get this machine moved

553
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,480
outside and the supervisor that morning comes in and is like, oh, the machine's not going

554
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,480
outside. And I'm like, oh, shit. And I pretty much damn near killed myself trying to make

555
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,160
sure there was enough room for people to be in there, and I ended up missing pretty much

556
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,780
the entire term because I had a migraine from nearly killing myself. Ouch. Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,400
And then I had to come and clean up after you bastards! I didn't go, so you didn't clean

558
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,200
up after me.

559
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,520
Why didn't we have any fuck you music playing during that?

560
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
That's not really a fuck you. That's not really a fuck you. That's a fuck you of like three

561
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
months ago. I thought the fuck you of this week.

562
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,380
We'll get to those later.

563
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,600
Post dated F.U.

564
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,760
We have to catch up. You usually send about ten F.U.s of the week every week, so...

565
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,240
Well, it's been kind of going down lately.

566
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,120
You're getting a little happier with life.

567
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,060
A little.

568
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,520
So now you've moved from Castro Valley to the wide wonderful... I didn't live in Castro Valley.

569
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,560
Oh, I lived in San Leander, which is right nearby, obviously, if you were to catch my

570
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
right.

571
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Okay.

572
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
But you've moved basically to Sacramento.

573
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,800
You don't live in Sacramento, but you live in the People's Republic of Davis, which is

574
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,560
a small hippie town just, you know, right outside of San Leander.

575
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
With a college!

576
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
Oh, wow!

577
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,960
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

578
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,400
Abandon hope I have.

579
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,760
So how does Davis differ than the Bay Area for you?

580
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
It's for...

581
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,160
You get a fine for breathing.

582
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Davis, by the way, the town that arrested the lady for snoring too loud, I think, wasn't that Davis?

583
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I didn't hear anything about Davis.

584
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Those were years ago, probably before you were born.

585
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Pretty little flat college town with absolutely nothing in it, and it's boring as hell.

586
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,160
And the college sucks because they aren't letting first year students have their cars when there's plenty of parking, and I'm hating it.

587
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,160
And there's one DDR machine in the whole town, correct?

588
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:30,920
yes and it's a it's a max one in a tapioca express so you don't really see

589
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:38,840
many about it and DER yes a beautiful combination yeah it would be stripped

590
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,840
too but they ran out of the shrimp there but it's a max one there and it's like

591
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,400
the volume is not that loud and yeah so how did you get into playing DDR was it

592
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Were you working at CVGL before Beaumont got big and they got the game one day?

593
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,400
No, it was almost two years ago when I started, when I actually first played DDR.

594
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Where did you first play DDR?

595
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
At Castro Valley Golf Land, as a matter of fact.

596
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,400
I just played a USA mix there and failed to stomp to my feet on my first song.

597
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeah, I was pretty much hooked after that.

598
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I've lost many hours in many twenties since then.

599
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Now, you didn't get the job at Golfland so you could play more free DDR, did you?

600
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Because that's sad.

601
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
No, I didn't.

602
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Sure.

603
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,400
I knew people that were there and they knew me and it made it easier to get a job there

604
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,400
for a summer job to get money to go to college.

605
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,200
The free only $20 in tokens every two weeks that I got

606
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,240
wasn't that big.

607
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,280
But hey, at least I got to play some stuff.

608
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,400
Alright, that's Black Lab, everybody.

609
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,880
Yay.

610
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,440
Alright.

611
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,560
So, what do we talk about now? We've got to fill three hours in this fish.

612
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,600
This is the moment on Orange Island where we yodel.

613
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,880
Give the mic to Loki, he's got something to say.

614
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Has anyone out there seen that show Three South?

615
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,880
Three South? No, what station is that on?

616
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
MTV.

617
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,880
No, I don't watch crap.

618
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
I broke the clip again.

619
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,880
Okay, anyways, no, it's this really cool cartoon.

620
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Do you want the clip or the mic?

621
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,880
I want the clip.

622
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Okay, anyways, so it's this really pretty funny show, actually.

623
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,880
It's the new cartoon they have on there, and it's about these three college guys

624
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,280
And from what I gathered, they're pretty retarded.

625
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,080
Uh, SoCalKick says it's stupid.

626
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
I watched it, it was funny.

627
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,680
Your opinion counts for Jack.

628
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,980
Anyways.

629
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,580
So, it was pretty funny, um, it was about...

630
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,680
Today's episode is about constructing the, uh, Stomach Pump 2000.

631
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,280
Right.

632
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,680
Is that like Sorority Life, but animated?

633
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,180
With less bitching and, uh, no hot chicks and...

634
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,380
Sorority Life was set in Davis.

635
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,380
That's something Davis is famous for.

636
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Yeah, now we know publicly that there's plenty of bitches in fucking Davis.

637
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Yeah, and that really helps me a lot.

638
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Uh-huh.

639
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,380
Yeah.

640
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,380
I'm sorry to interrupt, you were talking about some crappy show on MTV.

641
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,380
It was entertaining, okay?

642
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,380
I mean, I had fun watching it.

643
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,380
I now know it's on Thursdays, it gives me something to watch on Thursdays before I'm waiting for

644
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:39,300
I don't know the daily the daily show with Jon Stewart. Yeah, that's quality television that show owns

645
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,340
That show I don't know where the pin is. I'd lost the pin

646
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:50,260
I broke the clip again cool didn't you think some of the older animated shows on MTV were much better though like

647
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,020
Beavis and Butthead

648
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,860
beyond television

649
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,360
Huh with television that brought birth to both of those two shows. Yes

650
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Siffle and Ollie

651
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,360
with alex winner hasn't built those have been

652
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,480
uh...

653
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,960
i just remember the one show where he got shot in the head beginning of it

654
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,680
and so the whole out that he was bleeding

655
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,180
he didn't realize until

656
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,000
he reached up scratch his head and then

657
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,940
yes i'm reading and i

658
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,320
well then there is this two other shows that we probably want to forget about

659
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,160
the state

660
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,380
the state or would

661
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,840
the state was like the best of it sorry

662
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,980
i'm talking about and uh... i wasn't like the head

663
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,920
I liked the head, fuck you.

664
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,840
She likes head.

665
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,500
Anyways, and then there's also the uh... the Max.

666
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,160
The Max was cool too.

667
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,820
It was comic book genius.

668
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,940
I liked when they were talking about the Izzes. The ones that were just like... I think it was the Izzes.

669
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,220
The uh... stupid slugs that would jump like fifty feet in the air and then couldn't land.

670
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,620
They'd jump and just splat. It was cool.

671
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,980
You know what we need an animated series of?

672
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,220
Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

673
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,060
Well, we have Zim.

674
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,940
Oh fuck that dude, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac would be awesome.

675
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,340
Maybe later.

676
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,260
Like little shorts of Happy Noodle Boy.

677
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,040
Just Happy Noodle Boy would even be good.

678
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,300
The chat room, Vandalous in the chat room is asking, does anybody remember a show on

679
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,460
Nickelodeon called Turkey Television?

680
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,780
I barely remember it. I remember not liking it.

681
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,000
I remember the name but like

682
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,780
barely anything about it.

683
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,220
i used to watch out of control

684
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,480
was that the one that the guy we cut it out was that

685
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,940
yeah i think that's good

686
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,620
yes

687
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,860
the one that would like to be longer yes all of that shows that mark summer from

688
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,580
double-dare but it wasn't yes i know what you're talking about it was the guy

689
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,660
from full house

690
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,840
he did the cut it out

691
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,640
yeah i hella remember that show

692
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,980
and uh... well i remember seeing a land when you can't have a long as we're

693
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,500
reminiscing about old school and we know what else is right about here

694
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,600
fun house with jd ross

695
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,680
that shows off them

696
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,320
that show bucky rule

697
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,820
i had i had a computer game that had

698
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,440
that uh... of but how's that with this shit i was actually look at stuff about

699
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,960
fun house this week and they have they had a jd ross fan club and then talk

700
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,120
about that i think

701
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,760
fucking uh... homo like

702
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,400
he had a little homo pedophile i swear to god he's like sending like

703
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,680
photos of him just all sprawled out for children said

704
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,160
enjoy any

705
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,100
As Loki's imitating the pictures here in the corner of the room.

706
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,320
That guy was sad.

707
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,780
That guy was really sad.

708
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,940
He was like

709
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,220
one step below Vanilla Ice.

710
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,500
And just horrible.

711
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:10,340
I remember that show, but remember that J.D. Roth was also the host of GameProTV.

712
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,400
Well, I just brought this show to a screeching halt with that name.

713
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,560
No, I have to say though that Funhaus was awesome.

714
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,560
It was kind of funny, though, because some of the prizes that they had to get, they had to stick through their head with, like, Velcro.

715
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,560
It was like they'd have giant, like, boxes with the brand new Nintendo system.

716
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:35,560
So they'd just, you know, stick that through their head and they'd have to run out and they'd get, like, cash and money and prizes and shit.

717
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,560
It was awesome. That show was awesome.

718
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Ah, you'll appreciate this one, Jamie. I know you knew this show.

719
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Skyline's asking if you remember a show called Out of This World.

720
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,560
Yes.

721
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
It was, ding!

722
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,560
You put your fingers together and...

723
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,600
Okay in my life journal one of my old icons was Troy her dad

724
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:02,460
Showed the 280 shows I remember because they used to be on my wedding small wonder. Thank you very much that show is the shit

725
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,200
And the the girl I used to actually have a crush on punky Brewster

726
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,080
Soleil moon fry

727
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,480
Dude, did you hear Soleil moon for I had to get a boob job. She got her boobs reduced because they were so big

728
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,360
I just couldn't believe that that Punky Brewster had big tits because you know when when you saw her she had no tits

729
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,880
She was five

730
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,760
Twelve

731
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,940
You know speaking

732
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,120
We're kind of been talking about game shows and TV shows you ever hear those rumors a while back that they were filming a pilot for

733
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:44,040
A Dance Dance Revolution game show which has to be the dumbest idea. I've ever heard in my entire life

734
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,040
Code of Crap!

735
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Exactly, it's not even a bad joke.

736
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,040
You know, that took off as well as, uh, the DDR Movie?

737
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,040
No, it was the DDR Freak movie, remember?

738
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,040
Yes, it was a movie called DDR Freak.

739
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,040
I've seen the supposed script for it and it was bullshit.

740
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,040
Was that the script that started at Milpitas Golf Land?

741
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Because that was like, faker than Elizabeth Berkley's moves.

742
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,640
least moves i tried

743
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,860
who wrote that again

744
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,800
uh... i'm pretty sure it was one of the south bay folks but i i i actually tried

745
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
at the time to get the script for it

746
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,080
however the only way you can get

747
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,040
was it

748
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,580
uh... i think i thought it was

749
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,040
uh... the name popping in my head was nashi

750
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,280
i'm sure it's somebody that's now banned from d r freak anyways and for writing

751
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,600
that piece of crap you deserved it i'm just kidding i actually i tried getting

752
00:54:39,600 --> 00:55:01,600
You know, I almost wanted to sign up for that just because I wanted to know. I wanted to know how fake this shit was.

753
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Someone posted the whole script on DDR Freak. You could just go click the link and get it.

754
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Really? I thought it was fake, though.

755
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
It was in a thread. The supposed script, it was on there.

756
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
Interesting.

757
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Yeah, well, it was crap.

758
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,600
I would have liked to see it made. To be honest, I've seen worse made, and it's actually sold.

759
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,600
I think they could make a DDR movie, but not that group that was trying to do it.

760
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,600
What the fuck did you do to pay money to be in a movie?

761
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Let me go over a couple.

762
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,600
Pay money to audition? That's lame.

763
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,600
A couple actual movies that are out here. Let's just see here.

764
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Spectrum Entertainment, they're an awesome company that services anything that they get their hands on.

765
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
And I mean anything.

766
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Let's see, we've got Anklebiters, the all midget vampire movie.

767
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
That one's great.

768
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:09,600
We have one that's called Night Chills. It's about this guy that plays Dungeons and Dragons and then all of a sudden people are getting killed that play Dungeons and Dragons by this guy that's dressed up like a giant knight in armor suit thing. It's crap.

769
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,000
And then there's another one called Envy, full title Penis Envy.

770
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
It's about these two chicks that are wandering through the desert,

771
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,840
and they just decide, you know what?

772
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Our lives would be a lot better if we had penises.

773
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,640
So what happens?

774
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,120
This giant drag queen fairy just saw the penis fairy goes,

775
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,240
oh, you all have penises now.

776
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,520
And it's a couple hours of them just doing shit with their penises

777
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,720
and growing mustaches.

778
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,160
And it's just really nasty shit.

779
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,080
And at the very end of the movie, they make a trip down to LA

780
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,560
to meet the penis fairy again and to get it removed and the ends of tragedy as one of

781
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,920
the girls gets shot and killed. I just really didn't care. There's no plot to the movie

782
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,760
at all other than what would happen if two white trash hookers got penises and started

783
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,360
right around screwing the white trash redneck locals there and yadda yadda yadda yadda.

784
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,360
And for some reason no one notices that they're chicks with mustaches with giant dicks.

785
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,600
Did they have boobs too? They had boobs and dicks?

786
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:12,280
Yeah, that would appear and disappear at will. It's, like, fucking weird, okay?

787
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,520
This weird shit that this company pays for, and people fucking buy this shit.

788
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,120
I'm like... You did.

789
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,880
Apparently. No, I got it for free. I don't buy that shit. But you watched it, you wasted two hours of your life.

790
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,080
Well, hell dude, I gotta see how crappy this... You wanted to see Chicks with Dicks.

791
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,000
Hey, listen, I collect bad movies. Chicks with Dicks!

792
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,320
I actually have a collection of the worst movies known to man, and I actually go out

793
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,380
of my way to find these movies and buy them.

794
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:44,120
The next two movies that I have being sent to me are Feeders 2, Rated 1, the lowest rated

795
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,840
movie ever watched on something-awful.com, so I'm getting that movie.

796
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,920
Don't forget Manos, The Hands of Fate.

797
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,400
Oh, God, that movie is so bad, it put me to sleep watching it on the Mystery Science Theater

798
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
3000 version.

799
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,400
It was so bad that Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch it.

800
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,400
It was awful.

801
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
And then there was also, what other ones did we get?

802
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Oh, of course, Wild Zero is pretty bad.

803
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,400
That Japanese rock and roll punk.

804
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,400
It was a punk rock zombie alien movie with some chick that was a guy.

805
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,400
Weird shit.

806
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,400
I don't know.

807
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,400
What other movies did I watch that were really crappy?

808
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Let me see here.

809
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
We had one. He came from Planet K.

810
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,400
I had one really funny part in it where the alien walked up to this guy who got shot, picked up his gun,

811
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,400
shot him in the leg, killed his leg, shot him in his leg again, killed his leg, shot him in the leg again.

812
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,400
That was just hilarious at the time.

813
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,880
So now what's your plan? How are we gonna convince this company that they need to make a DDR movie?

814
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,120
Now I just made it to them. They're all it's done. Okay, we'll take well

815
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,000
So are we gonna have to have Jamie star in the movie and like grow a dick?

816
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,880
No

817
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,800
Do we have to do some stunts like that?

818
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:11,580
I use twin. I think I think you need some like up skirt panty cam stuff going there

819
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:17,980
maybe a zombie just for kicks maybe some topless chicks and an exploding toilet

820
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:23,180
and people who can't act to save their life oh yeah do it so we should all star

821
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:32,180
in it dude they should make they should make DDR freak the porno dude you could

822
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,140
cast like a bunch of hot Japanese chicks just playing DDR and how you sex on the

823
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:43,140
DDR freak and hot Japanese people are not like two things that can be used in the same

824
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
sex.

825
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,140
Fine!

826
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,660
Uh, DDR sex freaks or something like that, there you go.

827
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:56,140
First of all, there's already hentai art done involving a dance pad that I've seen one picture

828
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,180
because someone posted it somewhere.

829
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,700
I have not had the urge to go look for it, but I know it exists.

830
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,220
Why does it seem like that all of our conversations seem to stray back to porn?

831
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
That's alright.

832
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,220
It gets ratings.

833
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,660
I just don't know what it is.

834
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,820
Yeah, it's a little strange.

835
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,820
3-2-N-E.

836
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,460
But yeah, there were some really bad movies.

837
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:23,340
There's one that was like an American vampire, and that was with Carmen Electra.

838
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,380
And she was like some vampire, and then there was even...

839
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,420
They actually had a part in this movie, a track that you can listen to, that was making

840
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,420
fun of the movie.

841
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:39,180
so bad. They had a track, an audio track where people were making fun of the movie. I was

842
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:44,080
just like, okay. Interesting. Well, I think we need to make that our mission, is we need

843
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:50,880
to make an actual DDR movie. Orange Lounge, the motion picture. How about it? Let's break

844
01:00:50,880 --> 01:01:01,360
out the 8mm cam. Jamie, take off your top. No, Rob. It's for artistic purposes. No, no,

845
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:08,360
No, Rob. No. I have a yo-yo.

846
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,360
Man, if only I hadn't gotten rid of my hooker hook up there, man. I could have, like, been

847
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,360
like, oh!

848
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Wait, you knew a hooker or something?

849
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,360
Well, we can go into this story.

850
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Oh, God. All right. Why not? We've got three hours to film now.

851
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:28,360
Okay. This is a story of how I accidentally met a hooker. And one can say, accidentally.

852
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:35,760
How does one accidentally meet a hooker? Well, it's quite interesting actually and here's here's how it goes. Okay, one day

853
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,760
I decided, you know, I took a Friday off and I needed to get my hair cut because you know

854
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,520
It kind of gets long sometimes so I got my hair cut and everything and this is during the summer ones

855
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,540
You just got a haircut or you got them all cut, huh?

856
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,480
Worst joke ever anyway, yeah first I went and got one cut then I realized oh they didn't do it

857
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,320
So anyway, so I got done getting my hair cut and I'm about to turn off from

858
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:03,320
Folsom Hair, which is obviously Folsom around here in the Sacramento area.

859
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:12,320
So I was about to turn off to go home, and it looks like, I swear to God, she couldn't have been that old.

860
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,320
I thought she was a high school student and looked like her little brother.

861
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,320
So she's like, can we get a ride down the street to our apartment?

862
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,320
She was in high school, I swear!

863
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,060
That's why I thought it was, and they're like, it's kinda hot out here, can we get a ride

864
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,060
down to our apartment?

865
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,060
I'm like, where do you guys live?

866
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,060
Oh, just Creekside.

867
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,620
I was like, oh okay, cause it was like a couple blocks down the street.

868
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,620
So I was fine.

869
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:38,500
So they got in the car, and so I couldn't quite make the left to go to Creekside, which

870
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,400
was two blocks to go around the block.

871
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:48,600
So we go around the block and stuff, and her kid, who I found out was her son, was playing

872
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,460
around in the backseat, cause I had a bunch of anime movies back there and stuff.

873
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,580
And she was talking to me, and she kept hitting on me.

874
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,700
She's all, she's all, so, what are you doing, lady?

875
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,660
Do you want, do you want to go out tonight?

876
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,500
There was stuff like that.

877
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,460
Hey, baby.

878
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,300
Stuff like that.

879
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,500
I was like, I'm all, uh, now I got a girlfriend, you know,

880
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,260
I, I'm actually, you know, we're going out later and stuff,

881
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,780
so I took her back to her place, and she's all, she's all,

882
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,620
can I give you gas money?

883
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,780
Yeah, Loki has a girlfriend that hates DDR.

884
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:20,620
Yeah, I'm just messing with you.

885
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,620
No, no, no. She'll play DDR just when I'm not there.

886
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:29,620
She played it, like, once in, uh, Tahoe. Oh, anyways, back to the story with the hooker.

887
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,620
So, so, she...

888
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,620
Oh, so we... I take her back to her apartment, and she's like,

889
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,620
Here, let me give you gas money. No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

890
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,620
And she's all, well...

891
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,620
Wait, so a hooker was gonna pay you?

892
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,620
What?

893
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,620
She was gonna pay me for gas money to give her a ride to her house.

894
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,620
Oh, right. Gas money. Gas money. Yes, okay, yes.

895
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,620
I refused the gas money because it was like...

896
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:53,780
I refuse the gas money because you know it was you know only if you were being a

897
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,180
good samaritan. I was being a good samaritan. It was only a few blocks and it was like

898
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:01,780
You were helping your fellow hooker. I didn't know she was a hooker, okay? We haven't

899
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:05,500
gotten to the part where I figured out she was a hooker. Right now I thought she was

900
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:12,540
some she and now she was. SoCalKick says she needed a fill up. Hey she was okay

901
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:18,420
she was pretty hot okay and she was no she's like I thought she was just some

902
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,000
really

903
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,540
really desperate single mom who wanted some action or some shit like that so

904
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,940
if i happen to look like she was in high school

905
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,420
at the time yes you look pretty young so

906
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,640
i i i place her anywhere from like

907
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,740
seventeen that twenty

908
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,500
low twenty range so

909
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,620
i'm not good with age

910
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,660
shipment nowadays in the pocket twelve-year-olds look like sixteen-year-old

911
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,620
so what am i supposed to judge anyway had to finish is ok

912
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,120
so

913
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,680
i did refuse my since you are here you are you are set up

914
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,480
so i was like

915
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,560
okay so

916
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:53,920
i went to our apartment probably mistake number one here warps

917
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,980
yeah all you were forced in a gunpoint into our apartment

918
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:01,120
i was not forced i wanted to get them so that i don't know all shit all you

919
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,520

920
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,760

921
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,200
went to apartment

922
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,000
phone rang

923
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,140
right when we got in there so

924
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,060
actually is kind of weird because i think quite you know

925
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:19,660
realize it at first but she told her son to go play because mommy was

926
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,780
working for some like that

927
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,500
hot

928
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,300
anyway so we went to the apartment

929
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,040
nagata said uh... and she was no

930
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,260
phone rings so

931
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,000
i just sat down drinking soda

932
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,920
and then like

933
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,280
midway out of

934
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,900
but you know works against is their mom on the phone

935
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,420
with her head over the phone

936
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,860
what that means that

937
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,780
do you want to blow job mike

938
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,460
uh...

939
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,220
no

940
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,740
what kind of man are you you know i said

941
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:55,680
but i said no that's morally said yes i want to blow job but not from you you

942
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,020
stinky or

943
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,780
so anyways so i said no she got the phone she cut it

944
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,620
explain to me how she was working she she thought i was like afraid that she

945
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,080
was a cop or something so

946
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,080
She pulls down her shirt to show me her tits, and says, you know...

947
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
Oh! How nice!

948
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,080
So there was some gratification in that.

949
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Oh, yeah. Got a nice brush on.

950
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Your reward!

951
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,080
A reward, I guess. But she was just trying to prove to me that she wasn't wired or some shit like that.

952
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,080
So I was like, oh, no, that's really alright.

953
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:29,080
And this is where I probably should have just said, fuck it, I'm leaving.

954
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
Yeah, just get me the hell out of here.

955
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,080
But she got to see some titties, so now you were kind of wondering what's going to happen next.

956
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,640
yes about it

957
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,980
so i just like okay now i i can't do that so

958
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,400
so she's like okay

959
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,160
will cast another favor i might

960
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,540
uh... right what's i need a ride down to ranch itself like

961
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:52,100
okay five that's on my way home so i was gonna get a ride down to rancho for some

962
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,920
reason

963
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,500
it's a good out fifty

964
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,420
and uh...

965
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,040
during the way she's no

966
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,840
talk to me and shit and she's like yeah

967
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,560
still try to push the whole she wants

968
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,080
to give me a blowjob thing

969
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,940
and okay

970
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,580
I mean, right after refusing so many times you'd think I'd say yes, but just for some

971
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,360
reason I still said no.

972
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:16,140
And so, she started explaining the whole basic business structure of prostitution, which

973
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,980
is quite interesting actually.

974
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,700
Was she talking about her boss?

975
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:26,140
No, actually she was the pimp.

976
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,140
Which is quite weird.

977
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:30,780
It was a really strange infrastructure she's got going there.

978
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:56,780
She's basically fine, you know, like, she's all, she's really easy to become, like, you know, pink. She's all, she's got to basically find women that are walking around, don't, you know, know where they're going or what, they'll look lost and stuff, and you just say you'll take care of them, that you can make, they can make lots of money and that kind of shit, and right now it's kind of tuning her out and listening to the radio, but, um, she, then she started talking about, like, how she, like, had a bunch of apartments in different places and stuff like that, and just crazy stuff.

979
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:01,580
So I took her to Rancho and she wanted, she saw some like other hooker walking around

980
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,580
like

981
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,580
A hooker buddy!

982
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,320
She wanted me to come, she wanted me to like come get this hooker that'd be like my hooker,

983
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:13,900
like I'd be the pimp for this hooker, and I'm like no that's alright, I'm all, I'm all,

984
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:18,020
I'm all, I gotta, and then she wanted to give me her pager number so in case I had any friends.

985
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,020
Now I thought about

986
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,980
Like refer a friend to the wonderful world of whoredom

987
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:30,420
off the top. I was like, maybe not. So then she got out of my car finally and that's why

988
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,060
I sped off and went back home.

989
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:38,260
Okay, now the question about all this. How the fuck does this have anything to do with

990
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,260
I don't know about Imani.

991
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,260
Did we actually talk about Imani all day?

992
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:51,260
Well shit, we're almost halfway through the show and we haven't talked about Imani.

993
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,260
Oh boy, okay.

994
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:58,260
Well, anything else to add to your little wonderful wide world of whoredom story there?

995
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:04,260
She also thought that I didn't want to blowjob her because she was black.

996
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,260
She tried to pull the race card on me.

997
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:42,500
you can get to the chatroom from there or if you want to send them over email, that's

998
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:49,600
certainly possible as well. Just send an email to orangeloungeloungeradio.com. You guys send

999
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
those right now.

1000
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
No, you want to.

1001
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,360
We're going to start off this break with something from Max USA, I think. It sounds like a good

1002
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,200
idea. So, let's hear a song from Max USA and then we're going to come back and do the F-You's

1003
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,800
of the week and we're going to work an erotic song into this break too because it's pretty

1004
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
So, we'll see you guys in a little bit.

1005
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,120
If you need to rise to a convention, rise away

1006
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,840
Time's counting, the rhythm is a part of the music

1007
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,360
We gotta get with it, the pain is centering

1008
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,420
All my heart, even do it now, you're just a tango

1009
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,300
Oh, yes, I ready to take that fall

1010
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,560
If you need to make the call, then drop the ball

1011
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,840
Get your hands off the ball

1012
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,040
Drop the ball

1013
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,160
Let me see that ball

1014
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,080
Young God, you spilled my medicine

1015
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,080
If you need to rise to a convention, rise away

1016
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,760
The sun's bouncing, the rhythm's the march, the system's the winner

1017
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,800
The pain is staring, all my heart is a-doin'

1018
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,000
Now you must stand, go slower

1019
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,440
The odds are raised to take that fall

1020
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,440
And it's up to you to take that call

1021
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
To drop the ball

1022
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,080
To drop the ball

1023
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
To drop the ball

1024
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:43,460
Before we get into the next song, a real quick request, JB in the chat room wants to hear

1025
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:50,460
Jamie say, poopy on JB's mommy. Poopy on JB's mommy. Big piles of feces.

1026
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:40,460
I won't hold it back on you, c'mon, c'mon, I'll do some to you, I want you, so don't you deny that you, you, you, wanna fight forever, we can make it tonight, I really wanna hold you tight, a little bit, it's not enough, so gimme, gimme, gimme your love

All you do is call to me

It's not so easy

1045
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,200
Can't you see I want you

1046
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,200
But I want it too much

1047
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,200
I'm so wild

1048
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,200
Still with trust

1049
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,200
Baby, gimme all your thoughts

Don't be alert

1075
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,700
Your body takes part

1076
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,700

Gimme, gimme, gimme your love

1086
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700

Gonna make me feel like you're not in the screen, yeah

1094
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:58,540
Gonna make me feel like you're not in the screen, yeah

1095
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:54,020
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1096
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,020
Do we want to be summoned by Hollywood?

1097
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,020
No!

1098
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,020
Do we care what people think of us?

1099
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,020
No!

1100
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,020
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1101
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,020
Yes!

1102
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:14,020
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1103
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:20,020
You're listening to, uh, Porridge Lounge Radio, as somebody in the chatroom referred to it earlier.

1104
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:23,020
It's porn-tastic. It's fat-tastic.

1105
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,020
Makes my math wolta.

1106
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,020
Where we don't talk about the money ever on this program. That's just a sideshow.

1107
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:36,020
To DDR? Ha, ha, ha. Not here.

1108
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:42,020
Anyway, now we're going to get into a part of the show that I know is Jamie's favorite segment, right?

1109
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,020
Teehee.

1110
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,020
Is this your favorite part of the show? Yes?

1111
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,020
One of them.

1112
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,020
One of them.

1113
01:18:48,020 --> 01:19:04,020
Alright, this is the FU of the week where Jamie just goes off on something that pisses her off and then we all play along. We all talk about things that piss us off. So, without further ado, Jamie, what the hell is pissing you off this time?

1114
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:11,020
First thing that pisses me off is the fact that I've been using the same version of Slagwort. So, I think in the future we should use the, quote, Terror Mix.

1115
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:18,020
then

1116
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,900
early this morning

1117
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,540
i was over here watching

1118
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,180
showgirls

1119
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,900
are

1120
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,540
over here watching

1121
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,360
went live on the show

1122
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,180
which we do occasionally which is a more incentive to listen to our money is

1123
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:39,580
more program twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, on this station.

1124
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,980
Anyway,

1125
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,060
I get home.

1126
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:48,080
I knew Dan was going to be having people over for that piece of shit Xbox Live crap.

1127
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,340
I go in there and there's like everybody and God in my living room. God was in

1128
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:57,140
your living room? Well, no. Amazing. Because if God were there, he wouldn't be playing the Xbox.

1129
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:02,660
Anyway, he'd be too busy smiting people. He'd be playing Animal Crossing.

1130
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,660
Where everybody can be a god.

1131
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:08,660
Anyway, I go, and there's just all this stuff, and I'm exhausted.

1132
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:14,660
Look upstairs, just like through PBX, and then, and then Bailey will walk in, um, and...

1133
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,660
Ryan, Black Lab.

1134
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,660
...

1135
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,660
I didn't... Yeah, it's Black Lab.

1136
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:26,660
Um, they, they go through, they look like, uh, I don't know, like, pretty hyper, but Robert, like, he was about to...

1137
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,660
I was tired.

1138
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,660
Rise from your grave!

1139
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,660
It was very hyper.

1140
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,660
Did you hear that candy you ate?

1141
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,660
No, it was actually caffeine.

1142
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:41,660
Anyway, this is my fuck you, so leave your candy out of it.

1143
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:48,660
Anyway, I go downstairs and say, okay, one last game.

1144
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,660
Dan goes, no!

1145
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,660
You knew we were going to be here.

1146
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:56,660
Weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba-weeba.

1147
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:01,660
How inconsiderate, you know? I come home, and I'm tired.

1148
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,660
Was it his time of the month?

1149
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,660
Yeah, it must have been.

1150
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,660
He had the Oreo coke bowl with him.

1151
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:18,660
Anyway, I admit I came home late, and that's one thing.

1152
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:22,660
I would have thought that they would have wrapped it up by then, or would have just wrapped it up.

1153
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:27,660
You came home late out of consideration for the party because you didn't want to see no stinkin' Xboxes

1154
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,660
because they're just giant paperweights.

1155
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:34,660
Instead I come home and there's five TVs in my living room and three Xboxes hooked up

1156
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,660
and they're playing some stupid mecha ball game.

1157
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
Mecha balls?

1158
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:45,660
No, like you go to the one that's captured with five and you have to kick the balls off.

1159
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,660
It's really stupid.

1160
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,660
They were playing with balls obviously.

1161
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,660
And it was fucking loud.

1162
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:52,660
You've got a bunch of men in your living room playing with balls.

1163
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,660
Yes.

1164
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,660
Just checking.

1165
01:21:55,660 --> 01:22:00,660
So, I went upstairs and tried to make my icons, and I made like two Draco Malfoy ones.

1166
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,660
I was like, this sucks.

1167
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:09,660
So, this is what, you know, I thought that maybe he was going to be considerate and, you know, have everybody go home.

1168
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,660
And then this is what I hear.

1169
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,660
Okay, one more game!

1170
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,660
Fuck!

1171
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,660
I'm upstairs going, go home!

1172
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,660
You heard me!

1173
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:28,660
I was like, it's just going to come, I'm going to get out of my house, I want to go to bed, I would not have been able to go to bed with all of that bullshit going on.

1174
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:33,660
And I was fucking tired. Okay, I had been up all, for a while.

1175
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,660
You need to have your revenge. You need to have people over.

1176
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,660
I've never been money party at my apartment.

1177
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:43,660
No, you need to have people over for a gem marathon.

1178
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,660
Yes.

1179
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,660
No, I'll just have another good money party at the apartment.

1180
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:54,660
And the last one we had, what, 20 people showed up?

1181
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,660
Yeah, that's a lot of people.

1182
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,660
In my living room!

1183
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:04,660
Which, you know, the living room, you know, it's probably, it's a two bedroom, you only

1184
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:05,660
have really a one, no, you have a two bedroom apartment.

1185
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,660
I have a two bedroom, but it's a two story apartment.

1186
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,660
Sort of like a townhouse, but not quite.

1187
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Anyway, you know, I'm trying not to dwell on it, but it really pissed me off.

1188
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:21,660
And he's like mad at me for being mad at me, and I'm like, huh?

1189
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,660
Excuse me?

1190
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:30,660
You know, I've got it out of my system now. I'd love a little world where my displeasure is if you lose it through my live journal.

1191
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,660
I want all the Xbox balls to die.

1192
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,660
A big thank you to Xbox for ruining Jamie's life.

1193
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:55,660
Fuck you, Gates. I hope you die. May your breaks fail on the freeway and you go off of a cliff and land in a gigantic tank of sulfuric acid and dissolve slowly for hours until you finally die.

1194
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:02,660
And then I hope your soul doesn't go to hell or doesn't go to heaven. I hope you're stuck in purgatory where you're bored forever.

1195
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,660
My, are you done ranting? Are you finished?

1196
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:10,660
Excuse me, world! This is my segment, hello.

1197
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:15,660
You know, all of your little input is just, you know, consequence. This is my segment.

1198
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:20,660
It's funny, you just had to, like, reset the little F.U. song, like, three times by now.

1199
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,660
I'm the ranty bitch of the show, I'm alone.

1200
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,660
That's right, that's my role on the program. Music bitch.

1201
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:33,660
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1202
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:42,660
This is just, ugh, okay, I'm over, I'm good being seen without it. I've made several noises of the treasure.

1203
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:48,660
Okay, breathe in, breathe out, do some yoga, drink some boba, feel better.

1204
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:53,660
I get boba every night. This is a good fucking night. Anyway, next!

1205
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:56,660
Alright, moving along.

1206
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,660
Loki!

1207
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:03,660
Alright, how can you possibly follow up that porn story?

1208
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:06,660
Oh!

1209
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,660
Um, let's see.

1210
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:13,660
Well, I have to give a big F to my cold, which is now gone, thank god.

1211
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:18,660
But it lasted too long, and it was annoying, so thank god it's gone.

1212
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:27,660
I'm a big f-you to the putters at Golf Land because they keep chipping my shots.

1213
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,660
Every time I hit the ball it goes flying up in the air.

1214
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:34,660
I have to add to that because they're like made crooked.

1215
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:41,660
I swear to God they are. I mean, I've looked at all of them when I worked there, and if you actually hold the putter up and look at it, the faces are crooked.

1216
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:45,660
You can't putt straight with those things. They're made to fuck with you like that.

1217
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:52,660
Yeah, see, they make the putters, just like they make all of the clubs. See, they go straight and then they turn, so you can hit the ball.

1218
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,660
But I think that you meant the shaft.

1219
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,660
No one likes a crooked shaft.

1220
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:04,660
Like, how's it hanging? A little bent right now. Crooked.

1221
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
It's all shrivels and two left.

1222
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,660
That's actually a real, like, controller.

1223
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,660
A crooked shaft.

1224
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:14,600
uh...

1225
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,500
another

1226
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,520
yet the right to go back to it

1227
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,520
can i finish thank you again i think that

1228
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,520
now uh...

1229
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,940
that if you go to the polls and like all the for being one of the devil

1230
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,480
pulling out the fact that it's still going on

1231
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,000
but it's very kiddo

1232
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,860
i think they're called

1233
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,380
uh... little homies

1234
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:41,380
So I bought one, it's a stupid little thing that comes in above the wall.

1235
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,380
Oh dude, the homies dolls, I know what you're talking about, they're cool.

1236
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:50,380
So I took one of those and I took it to Golfland, and I wanted the homie to go down the rapids,

1237
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:55,380
cause you know, that's what the homie's gonna do when the ball is go down the fucking rapids.

1238
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,380
So I threw him up in the fountain and the fucking homie got stuck in the middle of the fountain

1239
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:02,380
and the goddamn thing couldn't get it back and my homie's gone!

1240
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:14,700
So anyways, an F.E. to the fountain that stole my homie, and uh, let's see, and uh, on top

1241
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:19,700
of that, that'd be the prize for making me spend $200 there, for putting stuff very cheap

1242
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:25,660
in uh, they had 40 speed CD burners for $19 there, how awesome is that?

1243
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:26,660
I mean...

1244
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:27,660
Good brand?

1245
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:33,840
It was pretty decent, but I ended up buying a $129 one because it was Yamaha, and it burns

1246
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,680
these really cool disc tattoo things that you can't see on normal discs, and they tell

1247
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,840
you that in the manual, not on the outside of the box, so that kind of sucks.

1248
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:48,880
F.D. and me were buying two Saturns and Kords for one, because I bought one from Denyos

1249
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,640
from this chick that couldn't speak English, but it was $10, so I was like, okay.

1250
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:59,640
And then this other one was like 75 and came with games and chords and shit, so I bought that and it was awesome.

1251
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,640
But yeah, F.U., that stupid chick couldn't speak English because she's the only one who speaks English.

1252
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,640
She lives in freaking the United States! Speak English, dammit!

1253
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,640
We don't speak Italian here! English!

1254
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,640
So, yeah.

1255
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:22,640
Aside from that, F.U. and my mom for making me listen to this stupid, like, spa music tape on the way down the denials.

1256
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:31,640
Okay, this guy, he took a cover, I mean, he was covering, like, for a release, and, uh, he called it Imagine.

1257
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,640
I don't know if he was able to record it, so that's good.

1258
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:43,640
Oh my God, I have some really weak FUs this week. Uh, FU for me not being a good FU.

1259
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,640
Yeah, fuck you. Play my music.

1260
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1261
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:51,640
And F-you to my fucking, this coworker of mine, Linda,

1262
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,640
Freakin' keeps telling me to get back to work and stop, you know, browsing the internet

1263
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,640
when I have like the highest phone time out of the company, you know,

1264
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,640
and I took like 400 calls in like one day and shit, which is pretty huge, and

1265
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,640
and she just has the nerve to like start, you know, bitching at me about being on the phone.

1266
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:13,640
Then she goes back and starts talking with the other girl who's not on the phone,

1267
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:18,640
talking about, like, her boyfriend, or some guy that she thought was cute and had a nice

1268
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,640
ass, and I'm just like, shit.

1269
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:26,640
So yeah, I have to get her, and that's it. I'm good.

1270
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:38,640
I have a couple FUs this week, believe it or not.

1271
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,640
No!

1272
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:47,640
My first FU goes to anybody I've ever gone out clubbing with before, because I've always had to drive in the past.

1273
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:52,640
But this week, I got to be a participant in the drinking festivities when I went out to the bar.

1274
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:59,640
I got so drunk off my ass, I had to be carried out of the bar, and I had so much fun that I've just been missing out all these years.

1275
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,640
So, F people who always make me be the designated driver.

1276
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,640
A big FU to Politary, I hate you.

1277
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,640
Um, yes.

1278
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,640
Everybody knows your collar is covered.

1279
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,640
They're probably trying to do you a favor.

1280
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,640
F you, lady.

1281
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,640
No!

1282
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,640
What's up on your foot?

1283
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,640
Ow!

1284
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,640
Watch out or I'll like, kick your face in.

1285
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,640
Like, what's your face?

1286
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,640
Uh, a big F you to my 2DX controller.

1287
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,640
You're a piece of shit and I hate you.

1288
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:41,640
that

1289
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,320
and uh... i think if you did colors for the same reason

1290
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,440
your position

1291
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,400
uh...

1292
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:55,440
if you do whatever called me during the show that was embarrassing

1293
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,400
uh...

1294
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,480
if you did anyone that doesn't live in sacramento because you live in a better

1295
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,920
place i'm sure

1296
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,560
no separate a visit

1297
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:10,400
and she goes up to the public

1298
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,840
you're right i'm sorry

1299
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,860
and florida's also exempt from that because you have to add

1300
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,000
all right so that's not that

1301
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,840
they still met the fucking ballot calendar

1302
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,800
or like uh... governor race

1303
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,200
good doctor

1304
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,120
working

1305
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:31,120
Chad's! What's a Chad? What's that poop in the frickin' home for?

1306
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:36,120
I swear to God, they're so stupid that- Oh. Yeah, they're stupid.

1307
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:41,120
Stupid old people that live in Florida. Old people suck. That'd be the old people.

1308
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:46,120
Watch it die! No one wants you around! It's why they're sitting in Florida! Just go die!

1309
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:51,120
Die! No one misses you! Die! They'll make room for more resorts!

1310
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,120
Florida is like the gateway to hell. It's like when I keep all the old people that wait to die.

1311
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:00,120
Actually, hell is really close to there. It's a small little island, but yeah.

1312
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,120
We can see hot people every day.

1313
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:11,120
Oh, and F you to Spazzy, who's in the shower right now, because he got to go see hot people last night, and I didn't, and I'm jealous. So F you.

1314
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
Okay, that's it. You get my turn now?

1315
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,120
Yes, it's your turn, Dave.

1316
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,120
No, I I get my song

1317
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,680
my son

1318
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:25,680
Literally, um, okay. I don't really have that many of you

1319
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
But many of them are like Rob

1320
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:32,560
Okay, first that's you to my parents for not wanting to take me out here

1321
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:38,320
I have to uh, I actually have to stop that for a minute because I have to thank Dave parents for the taquitos. Oh

1322
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,280
Okay

1323
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,720
That's all tacos the taquitos

1324
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,080
Okay

1325
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,080
That was horrible, die!

1326
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,080
Hehe, I...

1327
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,080
The tackle you...

1328
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:59,080
Ok, anyway, fuck them for not wanting to take me out here, and for making me read a hundred pages of a shitty-ass book today so I could come.

1329
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:04,080
Because a yellow raft in blue water is crap. I hate reading.

1330
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:27,080
And then, I also have Fuck You's to many QDX songs which I can't pass, such as Star Mine for the fucking last two seconds of it, because it has like 20 notes at once, and I always get down to 58% or whatever it is when you miss all of them, so fuck that, and fuck all the seven stars that I can't pass.

1331
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,080
Okay. I think that's it. That's it.

1332
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,080
It's Raining Men.

1333
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,080
Fuck this song. Oh, wait, no.

1334
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,080
And fuck Twen, because he said that he wanted to be fucked.

1335
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
No, and he said that he wanted to be-

1336
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,080
Whatever makes you happy.

1337
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,080
He said that he wanted to be everyone's fuck you, so.

1338
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,080
All right.

1339
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,080
And now we're-

1340
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,080
Is there any way he can get it?

1341
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,080
And now we're going to go to Black Lab's FUs.

1342
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,080
And this song is meant to be ironic.

1343
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,080
It's the cat song.

1344
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,080
Yay.

1345
01:33:54,080 --> 01:34:01,080
Okay, first, fuck this song. Because it's about cats. I would have rather heard who

1346
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,280
let the dogs out than this. I can arrange that song.

1347
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:12,280
Dude, it's a pussy song, okay? Like it. No. Okay, let's see. First of all, I think

1348
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:18,400
it's due to my FUs of last week, so fuck that. Because I was not around. I was at home, most

1349
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,640
of the weekend. Yeah, you had a birthday or something that you think's more important.

1350
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,640
Oh, shut up, Robin!

1351
01:34:52,640 --> 01:35:07,640
I gotta kinda give F you to my nosey little roommate because just before I left for the weekend, last weekend, I found out that he found my live journal and read through every single entry.

1352
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,640
And that kinda pissed me off.

1353
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,640
Really?

1354
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,640
It's on the internet. It's not private.

1355
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,640
No, but the fact is is that-

1356
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,640
But there's more to it.

1357
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:28,640
there's more to it

1358
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:56,640
They kind of had the consensus that I was going to go snap and fucking kill them because of all the ranting I do in my live journal.

1359
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,640
Just say yes.

1360
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:09,640
The fact that they actually went through and started using it against me was really irk me.

1361
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:19,640
And then my roommate actually went and decided to instant message a couple of my friends from my friends list asking about this stuff.

1362
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,640
And it was like, okay, that's just getting a bit too fucking nosy.

1363
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,640
And that really pissed me off.

1364
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,640
I think that's the first time anyone's ever said irk on this show.

1365
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,640
I beg to differ. I believe I would have said that word in the past. Come on.

1366
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,640
I like irks.

1367
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,640
Irk. Like irkle.

1368
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,640
I think I already said it before.

1369
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,640
I will have to check the archives soon.

1370
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,640
Anyway, Black Lapis is continuing.

1371
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:42,640
Yes.

1372
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,640
This is a fuse, please.

1373
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,640
How does that continue?

1374
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,640
Uh, let's see.

1375
01:36:47,640 --> 01:37:00,640
Fuck the dining halls at Davis, because you serve the same food over and over again, and I'm sick of it already, and next time I eat there, I swear I'm going to puke all over the table there.

1376
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,640
What? No, let him finish. Let me finish, dammit! I'm just...

1377
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,640
Let him move!

1378
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,640
No. Let Twin move.

1379
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,640
p0k3smot42o i like the rain for messing up this wheel on my bike so that now my brakes don't work

1380
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:40,400
p0k3smot42o

1381
01:37:40,400 --> 01:38:09,400
p0k3smot42o I played for 10 or 11 straight hours before I decided, oh shit, I think I need to get some sleep. So I slept for 2 hours, and then went and played some more. And I still want to go back and play more now.

1382
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:36,680
p0k3smot42o

1383
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:43,400
FU2 Old Navy. That place is Satan.

1384
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:49,400
It's just... it's evil. I hate the commercials. I hate the old stars that get on there.

1385
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:52,400
For the stupid commercials, I wish they'd all go to hell.

1386
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:57,400
And then the whole place, when you walk in there, it's just like one big giant Old Navy commercial.

1387
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,400
It's like... it's like so ANNOYING! I hate them!

1388
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:05,400
And the only reason I went there to buy clothes was because I had a fucking gift certificate for $50.

1389
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:10,400
I thought I spent all the money on the gift certificate because I was trying to get out there as quick as possible.

1390
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:15,400
And then I got there. Oh, you have $6 left in your cart! DAMMIT! NOOOO!

1391
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,400
I'm gonna have to go back there and shop more.

1392
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,400
No matter what, they're just gonna keep me there! No!

1393
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,400
Anyways, that's it.

1394
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,400
Looks like he's being sleepy.

1395
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:40,400
I've had a vanilla coke and my chocolate cupcake and I still have to be tired.

1396
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:13,500
dscs f me sky for making him work fuck being sick for almost two weeks fuck the doctors

1397
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,040
for scaring him about possibly having tuberculosis and fuck homework

1398
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:22,040
Fuck you to the doctor, which you don't know won't kill you.

1399
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:31,040
Twins says, uh, fuck you to lesbians, fuck you to chicks without dicks, fuck you to chicks without tits.

1400
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:37,040
Hey, hey, hey, okay, no titted chicks need lovin' to you, okay?

1401
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:44,040
He said, F you to chicks without dicks.

1402
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:51,040
Anywho, uh, fuck you to Loki for not giving him the pager number to that hooker.

1403
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,680
I don't have the pager number, so how can I give it to you?

1404
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:02,680
Uh, fuck you to still having his fucking cold, and fuck you to Mackintosh's.

1405
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:09,440
And, Quinn, stop saying that, because I'll, like, hack your ass with my Mac, okay?

1406
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
The Macs rule, bitch!

1407
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:46,200
who canceled his show Dark Angel. Fuck you to the DMV just for being hell with the whole

1408
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:53,200
Baskin-Robbins system going on. Now serving number twenty-one. Number twenty-one. Fuck

1409
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,720
you to Dave for not beating the ancient boy game. And fuck you to Vid Power for not letting

1410
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:05,960
me plug his restaurant. Dude, that game is a bit. I played for maybe half an hour straight,

1411
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:10,280
And I could get down to one little fucking egg with two cracks in it, and I couldn't

1412
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:11,280
beat it!

1413
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,960
And it just bounced around and I hit it like thirty times back and forth, and it never

1414
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,960
hit it.

1415
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,580
It was such shit.

1416
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:21,800
And then I was about to hit it, and then a pop-up window came and I lost!

1417
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,960
Like fuck!

1418
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,280
By the way, I'm being, I'm being told it's YOSPUB.

1419
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,280
YOSPUB.

1420
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,280
YOSPUB.

1421
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,280
Yeah, YOSPUB, it wasn't my fault.

1422
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,280
How far have you gotten?

1423
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,280
Go YOSPUB yourself.

1424
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,280
Anyway.

1425
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,440
Andrew says, what are the FUs for?

1426
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,120
I have a private message, what are the FUs for?

1427
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:45,600
Hopefully you're getting the hit by this point.

1428
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,820
DCB says, no FU, he just wants to plug his tournament.

1429
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:55,960
Fremont 2, January 11, 2003 at Funtime Pizza.

1430
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:01,800
He wants special FU music, but I didn't give it to him because I'm lazy.

1431
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:08,920
SkylineDC505 says, F you to HISP for not letting me get sleep and sucking at Shaft and getting

1432
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,320
me sick this weekend, thanks.

1433
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:18,800
Dark Tetsuya says, fuck you to mom's work, that's why I miss Shaft.

1434
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,720
Vid Pawa says, I don't have an F you of the week, but rather a thank you of the week.

1435
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,840
Oh, he has a thank you of the week, how nice.

1436
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,840
My thank you of the week goes to Cube Club, which is a public event sponsored by Nintendo

1437
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,840
and Panasonic.

1438
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:38,840
Basically, I played GameCube games and got free shit. Plus, I got a Nintendo wristband for beating total strangers at Mario Party 4, so thank you to the Cube Club!

1439
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,840
Aw, wasn't that special?

1440
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,840
I'm going to that Cube Club thing in, like, two weeks.

1441
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,840
I gotta take a...

1442
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,840
Where's the Cube Club? I wanna go to the Cube Club.

1443
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
They're doing it in San Francisco, uh...

1444
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
Are they gonna do it in Sacramento, I wonder?

1445
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,840
I don't know if they're doing it in Sacramento.

1446
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
I wanna go to the Cube Club!

1447
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,840
They're doing it in San Francisco on Thanksgiving weekend.

1448
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,840
I'm going! Yeah!

1449
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:02,840
I'm going to whoop some ass at Mario Party and give myself some free shit.

1450
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:08,840
See, what I'd do if I went to that thing is if someone started beating me at Mario Party, I'd just start kicking the ass of the person next to me.

1451
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,840
I'd be like, you don't want to do that. Fucker!

1452
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,840
Vandalus says, fuck you to Pac Bell for not installing DSL in his area. Dial-up sucks.

1453
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,840
Crowny face.

1454
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,840
Jomama says, fuck you to Toys R Us for being out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1455
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:30,840
For vandalism try win first try win first by the way you

1456
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:38,000
Fuck you Gio because okay get this I

1457
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:45,780
Know this is picky for me because being a Japanese major I go into the dance store to hang out sometimes

1458
01:44:45,780 --> 01:45:13,140
I have a comic book, one of the, this is how comics come in Japan when they're new, they

1459
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:17,500
come in a bound volume of different comics in one volume. Well, I have a Yu-Gi-Oh! one

1460
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:27,500
from 1991, okay? It's old! Get over it! It's a show about playing a card game! It's fucking

1461
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:32,500
old! Yay! Then again, there's also Hikaru no Go, which is about playing Go. The cards

1462
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:38,300
come to life, and the, you know, but I think that the anime is like Pokemon except with

1463
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,620
cards

1464
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:41,540
yeah and more strategy

1465
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:44,100
which means it's just as lame as Pokemon

1466
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:49,100
yeah but like the cards cost like four dollars a booster pack for some ridiculous amount of money

1467
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:52,020
so remember this, Digimon owes you. Watch it in Japanese.

1468
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:54,020
Digimon, I've never seen the Japanese.

1469
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:56,820
I have sweeties with you so I will show you.

1470
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:58,820
Oh, I remembered my F.U. now.

1471
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:05,700
F.U. to my back for looking all ugly and F.U. to me for being tall because now I have nasty ass stretch marks on my back.

1472
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,540
They're the most disgusting stretch marks of all time.

1473
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:11,140
That was so pleasing to hear.

1474
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,660
No, they're so disgusting.

1475
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:15,300
I'll show you later.

1476
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:16,940
Right.

1477
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,460
I have a few more chat rooms.

1478
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,940
Two more chat rooms, Matthews, and then we're done.

1479
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:24,780
EOSFBB says his name changed time.

1480
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,500
I did do him already, but I'm giving the correct pronunciation.

1481
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:33,900
It's EOSFBB, whatever.

1482
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:34,860
Okey-dokey.

1483
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:38,860
And Andrew did submit an F.U. after all. He says F.U. Rob. Thank you.

1484
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:39,860
Fuck you too, bitch.

1485
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:43,860
That's it. Oh, I have to check the mailbag.

1486
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:47,860
Mailbox! I predict emptiness.

1487
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:50,860
Yeah, I predict emptiness too, but we're gonna check the mailbox.

1488
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,860
If they don't know where to send emails by now, they're out of luck.

1489
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:03,860
Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo Deck Inn.

1490
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:13,780

1494
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,700
On that note, we're going to take a quick break and we will come back and at that point

1495
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:53,580
we're going to do a little segment we call listless.

1496
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:58,300
And it's a five person listless tonight so it should be exciting.

1497
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:01,640
The topic is very interesting, that's all I have to say.

1498
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:06,000
So here we go, we're taking another quick break, we'll be back in a little bit, see

1499
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,640
You

Saki no mienu tenka ini vasu ni sonai Iso mae lo mokigii kaga yo yo yo

De no te do samame da jibushima gebe shaban Muka shikashi no tsuve de marumi e

1503
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,960
Sei boku hou miyatasuka irika ise, mizu kara ji tai kya

1504

Tsurudame ni mae ni mae ne, ni punei hou

Me lo mae ni tasu, maru doba, zon, tasu, no kabe ukabe

1507
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,380
Hey!

1508
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:05,880
One, two, one, two, three, four!

1509
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:25,580
This is the first time I saw this kind of reproduce in the magazine!

1510
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,880
What do you think of the Orange Lounge main line of music in Moore's show?

1511
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:46,880
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

1512
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:52,880
It's unearthly. It's like being in a club except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1513
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,880
Hi. You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're back.

1514
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,880
No one would dance with that guy even if he did ask.

1515
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,880
The only decent DDR film ever made, by the way.

1516
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:09,180
Oh, that was fucking hilarious. Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Loki disagrees. That was stupid.

1517
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:12,780
He disagrees it was decent.

1518
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:16,180
So let's do our list list. Let's do our list list.

1519
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:20,280
Alright, tonight on list list

1520
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:24,720
I gotta find tonight's theme music, but why don't you tell us about the topic,

1521
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,000
Jamie, for tonight's list list.

1522
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,200
The topic is your favorite beverage to have while playing

1523
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,520
a more active Bemani game, namely

1524
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:38,520
DDR, Pada Pada, Dance Maniacs, or if you really get into it, Drum Mania.

1525
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:43,520
You know, if you break a sweat playing 2DX, you know, all that wrist action.

1526
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:49,520
Some people have a very big experience in their wrist action, so that's a problem for them.

1527
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,520
But...

1528
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,520
You know, hey, I know people that freestyle playing 2DX, namely me. It's fun.

1529
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:00,520
So, I think that...

1530
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:03,800
Let's explain, because this is the season premiere and we have some new people listening,

1531
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,800
let's explain what List List is.

1532
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:09,440
And it's not List List, it's List Less.

1533
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:16,720
So List Less is the segment, now they get it, I just talk funny, I'm sorry.

1534
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:24,180
List Less, this list, this list, this list, this list, Corky, this segment of the show,

1535
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:28,980
we make the definitive list on some topic and basically the way it works is that we're

1536
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,780
We're all going to name our top three, so we'll have a list of 15 beverages that are

1537
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:39,200
great to play, that are great to drink while playing DDR, 2DX, whatever, and then we'll

1538
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:43,580
all go around the room and everybody eliminates one thing from the list, and then the chat

1539
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:51,020
room will vote to decide the ultimate DDR beverage, Bemani beverage.

1540
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:57,980
So that's how it works, and if you ever saw the old VH1 show, the list, nothing to do

1541
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:00,460
with it. Absolutely nothing to do with that. Nothing at all.

1542
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:05,180
Okay, so... Wait, wait. That show is the stupidest fucking

1543
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:11,160
show ever. Because, okay, they let the audience pick their favorite that gets put on the list,

1544
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:15,060
but the audience already picked their favorite. So why wouldn't they just pick it again?

1545
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:19,320
The reason why that show sucked is that Lauryn Hill somehow ended up on every single list

1546
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:24,080
they ever did. It could be best male artist of the 80s, and Lauryn Hill was number one.

1547
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,240
every time

1548
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:26,120
every time

1549
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,080
no and needed one

1550
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,720
good album one good album i mean let's check out the food you select you don't

1551
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:33,040
cuz that wasn't so

1552
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,320
but it was a whole nother and let's go for a little

1553
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,800
all that they'll do it after the war in hill fans next week

1554
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,120
uh... because i'm special off

1555
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:43,880
my number three

1556
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,720
is oxygenated water

1557
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:50,000
oxygenated water i don't remember the brand but i bought oxygenated water one

1558
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
time and I felt like absolutely freaking refreshed after it. It was really cool.

1559
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Do you guys see the same thing just by shaking up a bottle of water?

1560
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I mean, that's oxygenated.

1561
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
This is like super oxygenated water. I don't know. But it was kind of cool and I felt a little lightheaded.

1562
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
So, um, yeah. Next.

1563
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Ah, Loki, your number three choice for best beverage for baloney.

1564
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,240
I only really drink one thing, um, the rest are just gonna be what I would be drinking

1565
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:25,240
if I wasn't drinking one thing. I'm gonna have to say a 40 ounce malt liquor.

1566
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:32,240
That's the winner. No need to have anything. Alright, 40 ounce malt liquor.

1567
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:37,720
A freshy smooth malt 45. We're gonna have Billy D. Williams come out

1568
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:41,880
and play DDR. Okay, now, uh...

1569
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,880
Dave, you're number three Vic.

1570
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:51,880
Yeah, um, I don't really drink too many varieties of drinks or soft drinks or power drinks or,

1571
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:56,880
you know, sports drinks or whatever, but I know that one drink that gets me hyper as

1572
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:03,880
fuck so I can play keto and get all the way to Max X is Jolt, because that gets me so

1573
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:04,880
hyped up.

1574
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,880
Jolt!

1575
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,880
All the sugar and twice the caffeine.

1576
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:09,880
That's what got me through college by the way.

1577
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:10,880
Yes.

1578
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,880
Jolt. Okay, Black Lab, your number three choice for Best Pamani Beverage.

1579
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:23,880
Alright, here. As you may not know, the only DDR machine in Davis is in a Tapioca Express.

1580
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:24,880
Excuse me.

1581
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:33,880
So, appropriately enough, one of the drinks that I usually get every time I go in there would be a strawberry snow bubble for Tapioca Express.

1582
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,880
It's kind of like a Slurpee.

1583
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,880
So you're specifically stating a strawberry snow bubble?

1584
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:38,880
Yes, I am.

1585
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,460
yes i am okay

1586
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:41,900
just wanted to double check

1587
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,700
well well

1588
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:47,220
i know it'll get wiped out for these i just need something to fill space

1589
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,460
yeah it was

1590
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:53,100
it's like kinda like a Slurpee except it's like they use like a special syrup in it

1591
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:59,500
and it's kinda like they use milk in it too so it's like milky and it's like really really really really good

1592
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:03,980
and plus it's really good when you have taffy okay

1593
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:06,460
alright strawberry snow bubble from black lab

1594
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:11,240
my number three pick for best mamani beverage and if you've ever

1595
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:14,280
if you've ever been to one of my infamous house parties

1596
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,360
you'll know why i'm naming this one

1597
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:23,360
my number three pick is goldschlager

1598
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,960
instant fun just add goldschlager

1599
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,360
is my number three pick and for the kitty that's all i have to say

1600
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:34,000
for all the kitties it basically tastes like um... drinking cough syrup but it

1601
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,380
fucks you right up

1602
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:40,700
bucks you right out here

1603
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:45,620
is very propel very propel i usually have this with me more often than my

1604
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:48,460
number one choice because my number one choice is harder to find

1605
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,460
however

1606
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:53,740
there's a bottle of berry propel freakin sitting in rob's

1607
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:58,300
refrigerator because i bought it but i had to have my vanilla coke first

1608
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,580
all right so berry propel

1609
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,460
jamie's number two drink

1610
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:09,460
lucky you're number two pick for best money beverage

1611
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:12,740
early have anything other than my

1612
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:13,660
number one

1613
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:20,660
so i have to go with imported mexican

1614
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,540
what it makes him what

1615
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:29,100
tequila

1616
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:32,200
Is that what the cayenne pepper to go with it and keep you from pooping?

1617
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:35,000
Imported Mexican tap water!

1618
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:41,800
By the way, a little note of fact for people who don't have the, you know, years of natural healing experience that I do.

1619
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:45,700
If you're going to go to Mexico and drink the water,

1620
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:52,500
better eat cayenne pepper before you do, because it will keep you from shitting all over everything.

1621
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:52,900
Okay.

1622
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,300
Oh, Jesus.

1623
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,200
Alright, um, where are we?

1624
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,700
Dave, yes, you're number two choice.

1625
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:05,700
I'm not sure I can be imported next tap water, but my number two choice is vanilla coke icy.

1626
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:11,700
Because those things are hella good, and they're really, really sweet, like twice as sweet as a normal vanilla coke.

1627
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:14,700
Vanilla coke icy, good choice, good choice.

1628
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:17,700
Quack quack, be your number two pick, please.

1629
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:22,700
This one of mine is just like a recently discovered thing, I just tried it out once, it was like, oh, this is hella good.

1630
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:30,700
It's made by Snapple. It's the Atomic Elements drink, which is the jack-apple flavor.

1631
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:37,700
It's got caffeine and ginseng and a bunch of other good shit that keeps me awake and hella hyper.

1632
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:41,700
And that's one of the things that I had last night that helped contribute to my 2D expansion.

1633
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,700
Very nice.

1634
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:50,700
My number two pick? My number two pick was Red Bull and Malibu.

1635
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:55,700
However, at the risk of sounding like a lush, I'm just going to cut that to Red Bull.

1636
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,700
That's the drink that looks like urine.

1637
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,700
Yes, the drink that smells like pussy.

1638
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,700
Or so I've heard.

1639
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:04,700
It actually does look like urine.

1640
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,700
Yeah, it does look like pee.

1641
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:09,700
But you know, my favorite bar has it now where it comes out of the spray.

1642
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:12,700
Like, they don't even have to open up the cans anymore. It's just right in the tap.

1643
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,700
It's like Pepsi, Sprite, Red Bull. Fucking rules.

1644
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:21,300
Alright, so now we're down to our number one pick, Jamie, your number one best Bemani

1645
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,300
beverage.

1646
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:26,500
Well, I have often said that one of these days I'm actually going to own one of the

1647
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,420
vending machines for this beverage.

1648
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:32,820
I have ordered this stuff plenty of times and brought it in to our figgle to play and

1649
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:34,380
drink and stuff.

1650
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:38,420
Pocari Sweat, the drink that actually does look like sweat, and it tastes much better

1651
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:40,940
than Gatorade.

1652
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,940
Pocari Sweat.

1653
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:42,940
Yes.

1654
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,940
Alright.

1655
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:45,940
It's sweat-a-licious.

1656
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:48,940
Pocari Sweat is kind of an intimidating name to me, I don't know.

1657
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:51,940
I don't know how I feel about Pocari Sweat.

1658
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:54,940
But anyway, let's move right along, shall we?

1659
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:58,940
Loki, your number one pick for best bemani beverage.

1660
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:01,940
I'm just going to go with Surge, because I love that stuff.

1661
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:02,940
It's good.

1662
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,940
Surge!

1663
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:08,940
Surge sounds like it should be with Slim Jim, I don't know.

1664
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:11,940
Alright, so Surge, which they don't even make anymore, correct?

1665
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:16,940
I can't believe I was like, after I said vanilla coca ice, I completely forgot what I was going

1666
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:24,940
to say for this one, but I finally remembered. Hawaiian punch. Because they sell that down

1667
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:30,940
at the shell for like 99 cents for a two liter, and I remember the days when it's raining,

1668
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:33,940
and everyone runs over there and buys like ten of them, and then you all just take them

1669
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:36,940
back and put them in between the two DVR machines.

1670
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,940
just take them back and put them in between the two DVR machines.

1671
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:42,940
Would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?

1672
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:44,940
Punch.

1673
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:46,940
Don't punch!

1674
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:50,940
BlackWav, your number one choice, please, for Best Pay Money beverage.

1675
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:54,940
As the people in the room can see, I have a hat on.

1676
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:57,940
It has the logo splattered all over it.

1677
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:00,940
And for those of you that aren't in the room and can't see it,

1678
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:03,940
it happens to be Mountain Dew Code Red.

1679
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:25,940
kostjamrh That shit tastes worse than Cherry Nyquil.

1680
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:27,940
Does not.

1681
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:29,940
No!

1682
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,940
Touch code red and die!

1683
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,940
Alright, my number one pick.

1684
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:40,940
Now, those of you who know, I know we have a lot of people from Vegas in the chatroom,

1685
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:45,940
so I know you guys will agree with me on this one, because this is the best Bimani drink I've ever had.

1686
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:47,940
I had the most fun playing Bimani.

1687
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:48,940
Who's in Vegas?

1688
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:49,940
We have a few people from Vegas in the chatroom.

1689
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:51,940
Isn't like, Geos, Listen, Maple?

1690
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:52,940
Yes, I believe they're from Vegas.

1691
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:53,940
We have Maple also, right?

1692
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:54,940
No, Maple's in the bag.

1693
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,940
Oh, really? Okay, never mind.

1694
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,940
You don't know what you're talking about!

1695
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,940
I believe VidPower is from Vegas.

1696
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:02,940
We have some other folks there.

1697
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,940
Anyway, can I finish? Can I finish?

1698
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:05,940
No.

1699
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:08,940
So those of you in Vegas know about the Hilton.

1700
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:10,940
And the Hilton's got this little place called the Star Trek Experience.

1701
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:12,940
And at that experience, they sell a drink.

1702
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:13,940
Oh, you bitch.

1703
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:15,940
The Warp Core Breach, ladies and gentlemen.

1704
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:18,940
I fucking love the Warp Core Breach.

1705
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:22,940
I have done drunken DDR on the Warp Core Breach and it is the shit.

1706
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:33,940
Warp Core Breach, seven different kinds of Bacardi, Asobi, and Razzmatazz, all mixed together in a fish bowl, served with dry ice, and they won't serve it to just one person.

1707
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:35,940
Well, you can't order a one-person serving of it.

1708
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:38,940
Although, oh yeah, yes, they have it different now. You can order a one-person serving of it.

1709
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:45,940
Well, the DDR Freak Moderator's Trip, I have a friend that lives in Vegas, my friend Sierra.

1710
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:52,440
It was me and Iguana Girl and her boyfriend, Islander, and my friend, T'Nara, and her man.

1711
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,440
We all go to the Warp-

1712
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,440
We all go to the Warpcore Beach.

1713
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:58,940
We all go to the Star Trek Experience and proceed to go on the ride once.

1714
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:02,940
Then have Warpcore Beach go on the ride again.

1715
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:07,940
That's exactly what I did at the 25th RockyCon, which was the first time I ever saw DDR, by the way.

1716
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:10,940
Well, my friends left, and it was just me and Iguana Girl and Islander,

1717
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:16,940
and we all decided that we were going to go over to Circus Circus and play DDR there.

1718
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:23,940
That's exactly what I ended up doing. I believe I threw up the Romulan chicken strips later that night.

1719
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:27,940
It was a tribute to that first time on DDR.

1720
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:34,940
And half the tab was broken, and it was just like the...

1721
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:36,940
Drunken DDR is cool.

1722
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,940
Drunken DDR rules.

1723
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:49,940
So now here we do. We have a list. I was not expecting the list to look this diverse, that's for sure.

1724
02:07:49,940 --> 02:07:56,940
A few notable exceptions. According to our chat room, we have made a few notable exceptions, including...

1725
02:07:56,940 --> 02:07:58,940
Water?

1726
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:00,940
I said oxygenated water.

1727
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:02,940
Pepsi Blue is the big thing right now.

1728
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:08,140
thing right now. That stuff is shit. It tastes like someone ate strawberries and puked them.

1729
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:14,180
I was thinking about that, but vanilla coke icees, like, so own that, because they do.

1730
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:19,060
That Pepsi Blue shit is nasty. Actually, I would have said Pepsi Blue because I don't

1731
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:23,900
actually like it, but it's really heavily- Yeah, but you also like to go red. Well, yeah.

1732
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:28,620
I think it's really too heavily carbonated for me, and it makes me gassy. It makes you

1733
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:32,500
fart. I heard it makes you shit green, but I haven't really tested that. Anyway, nope,

1734
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,500
nope alright

1735
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:38,140
and then uh... also uh... pussy juice was another suggestion

1736
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,900
i was actually thinking of saying that

1737
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:43,920
but then i was like no red fusion

1738
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:47,180
a bunch of those new trendy drinks that's the new

1739
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:50,980
all right so uh... you know a bunch of those new trendy drinks so they didn't make the list

1740
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:52,340
so f you

1741
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:57,380
water here's our list oxygenated water forty ounce malt liquor jolt strawberry

1742
02:08:57,380 --> 02:09:00,140
snow bubble goldschlager berry propel

1743
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,220
imported mexican tap water

1744
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:08,700
Vanilla Coke Icy, Snapple Atomic Elements, Red Bull, Pocari Sweat, Surge, Hawaiian Punch,

1745
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:12,100
Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

1746
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:15,620
So we're going to start eliminating shit from this list right now.

1747
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:17,660
Jamie, what the fuck's coming off this list?

1748
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,140
The imported Mexican tap water.

1749
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:26,100
I would prefer not to play DDR and something like explosive diarrhea.

1750
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,540
Diarrhea diarrhea revolution.

1751
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:31,540
So imported Mexican tap water is coming off the list.

1752
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:33,540
We have a cry.

1753
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,540
Loki, what's coming off the list?

1754
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:42,540
I'm going to have to say goodbye to Red Bull because, yeah, it does look like pee.

1755
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:46,540
It smells like pee and probably is pee, but that's all right.

1756
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:48,540
All right, so Red Bull's gone.

1757
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:50,540
Fine.

1758
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:53,540
But you know what? You've got to mix it with Malibu, but I didn't want to sound like a lush

1759
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:55,540
because I don't know if you realize, but all my other drinks are alcoholics.

1760
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:57,540
So anyway.

1761
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,540
Okay.

1762
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:01,540
Dave, what's coming off the list?

1763
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:06,540
Having not had most of these, such as the warp core breach, or something like that,

1764
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,540
or, you know, gold schlocker.

1765
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,540
You're just going to have to trust us.

1766
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:12,540
I think I'll take, yeah, I know.

1767
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:19,540
I think I'll take off the strawberry snow bubble because, what, I mean, it would seem,

1768
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:24,540
it would seem like it would be too heavy to play DDR afterwards if it was all milky.

1769
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:27,540
I know, but it just doesn't seem like the type of DDR drink.

1770
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:32,540
I think they'll go have a strawberry snow bubble and go play Waka-Laka.

1771
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:35,540
I wouldn't have been able to do that in the first place because it's only a max one.

1772
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:38,540
Strawberry snow bubbles off the list. All right.

1773
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,540
Black Lab, what's coming off this list of what's left here?

1774
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:44,540
Yeah. Let's see.

1775
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:48,540
As original as some of these are, hmm.

1776
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:52,540
I'd say the 40-ouncer has to go.

1777
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:54,540
That's just a bit too much liquid to drink while you're playing.

1778
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:56,940
small lickers coming off

1779
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:59,780
he just made billy p cry

1780
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:02,660
how i would like to watch him cry

1781
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:07,620
i come home from a hard day of playing ddr i like to relax with a nice ice cold

1782
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:09,260
cold forty-five

1783
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:14,260
so oh another notable exception we left off the list balls

1784
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:15,860
ball

1785
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:18,740
let's give balls the honorable thing

1786
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:22,940
if balls got forgotten obviously none of us are drinking balls

1787
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:23,820
and i think

1788
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:27,660
Maybe if we thought of it before we started eliminating drinks, then yes, but no, too

1789
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:30,000
late now, too late now.

1790
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,340
It gets an honorable mention, how's that?

1791
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:36,260
Falls gets an honorable mention.

1792
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,820
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

1793
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:41,500
Yes, you have to repeat it.

1794
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:48,860
Black Lab said, I said I had never had Falls, and referring to the drink!

1795
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:50,660
Blue Balls on top of that.

1796
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:53,780
Anyway, can I finish, do I get to take my drink off now?

1797
02:11:53,780 --> 02:12:02,780
My drink, this is an easy pick for me. I think this tough stuff tastes like turpentine, cat pee, I hate it. Bye bye, Serge. I hate Serge.

1798
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,780
Dude, I fucking love Serge.

1799
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:09,780
Dude, this is the first time that none of mine have been eliminated ever. I've been keeping track.

1800
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:12,780
Poor Matt is denied. You are denied.

1801
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:17,780
For those keeping score at home, all of Loki's picks got eliminated.

1802
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:19,780
And how does that make you feel?

1803
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:21,780
That's right.

1804
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,780
Olive.

1805
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:24,780
God, Surge tastes like shit.

1806
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,780
How come we're not even that light?

1807
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:27,780
Okay, important.

1808
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:31,780
Okay, you don't like Surge that you can drink that pesky blue shit?

1809
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:32,780
Yes.

1810
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:33,780
For the record, yes.

1811
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:36,780
For Lamb's Blood, but you know, I didn't add that on there.

1812
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:40,780
Lamb's Blood? You're a sick bastard.

1813
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:43,780
How about, like, cow brain mucus?

1814
02:12:43,780 --> 02:12:46,780
Alright.

1815
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:50,780
Yeah, uh, you guys are weird. You guys are so weird.

1816
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:54,780
I wish it was the time that we were at Brookfield and, uh, uh,

1817
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:58,780
uh, sheep have ordered, uh, what was it, a, uh,

1818
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:02,780
a monkey's brain, or something? I don't remember, I don't think that was it.

1819
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:06,780
That was great. No, but he ordered it!

1820
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:10,780
I'm loading up a song here to play

1821
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:14,780
during the break here, so, um...

1822
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:18,900
Hi, so what I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to have Jamie read the list

1823
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:22,540
and then I'll paste it in the chat room and you guys will have five minutes to vote.

1824
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:25,940
So, Jamie, would you please, oh wait, let me post it in the chat room.

1825
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,700
You gotta send me your vote over private message in the chat room.

1826
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:33,380
Jamie, would you be so kind as to read this list off?

1827
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:35,660
There, un-highlighted.

1828
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:37,580
Oxygenated water,

1829
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:38,280

1830
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,540

02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:50,740
Bokari Sweat, Hawaiian Punch, Mountain Dew Code Red, and a Warp Core Breach.

1834
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:56,740
Alright, so there it is. Send me your votes over private message in the chat room. If they don't come over private message, they don't count.

1835
02:13:56,740 --> 02:14:01,740
In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break. I'm just trying to queue up some music for you guys.

1836
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:10,740
No, just to reiterate for you guys, what you vote for will not be taken off the list. We've already done that. That was all done in-house.

1837
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,960
Were the celebrities, so we get to do that.

1838
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,960
You guys are picking the winners, you guys are picking the top three.

1839
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,280
So out of that list, you're just gonna send me your favorite.

1840
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:27,680
And whatever gets the most votes, you know, wins first place, and whatever gets second

1841
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:28,680
most votes gets second place.

1842
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:31,640
So you're voting for your very favorite out of that list.

1843
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:36,000
In the meantime, here's a song that is often requested on the station ever since we played

1844
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,060
it on one of Jamie's –

1845
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:53,780
Let's play some Tetris motherfucker.

1846
02:15:37,060 --> 02:16:03,180
Can't you feel it?

1847
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:13,180
Can you feel it?

1848
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:23,180
Can you feel it?

1849
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:39,180
Can you feel it, feel it, can you feel it, feel it

1850
02:16:39,180 --> 02:17:01,180

1862
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:14,180
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that this is your first time playing this

1863
02:22:37,180 --> 02:22:42,180
Today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter

1864
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:44,180
A, and the number 59.

02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:49,180
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1866
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:50,180
Hi.

1867
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:54,980
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just finished up, or we're finishing

1868
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:59,580

1869
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:03,080
Beymani drink, and this was the final list, what, Dave?

1870
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:06,180
I just beat us in the disc on 2DX 7.

1871
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:08,720
Wow yeah that's my fifth 7 star.

1872
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:10,620
All the girls want to have sex with you now.

1873
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:13,300
Oh yeah! How many of them are even listening?

1874
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:16,640
I don't know how many girls are listening, I don't get that kind of breakdown.

1875
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:17,300
Twin.

1876
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:18,520
Anyway.

1877
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,540
We're kidding.

1878
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:22,440
Oh.

1879
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:24,520
Newt. Newt. Newt. Anyway.

1880
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:26,340
I just gave him a compliment.

1881
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,280
This is the list.

02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,900

02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:37,660
Breach.

1885
02:23:37,660 --> 02:23:38,660
And now...

1886
02:23:38,660 --> 02:23:39,660
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

1887
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:40,660
What?

1888
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:42,700
I just have to say, if like, if Twin was a girl, then his girlfriend would want to date

1889
02:23:42,700 --> 02:23:43,700
him.

1890
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:44,700
Anyway!

1891
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,700
She's in the lesbian drive.

1892
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:46,700
Anyway!

1893
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:47,700
What does that have to do with the money?

1894
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,940
That is not cool.

1895
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,940
Not cool.

1896
02:23:49,940 --> 02:23:51,940
Spray personal information out on the radio.

1897
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:52,940
Nope.

1898
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:53,940
Not cool.

1899
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:55,300
Oh yeah, after you're talking about your whole hooker experience.

1900
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:56,300
Hey!

1901
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,300
Hey!

1902
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,300
Hey, that is me sharing, okay?

1903
02:23:58,300 --> 02:23:59,860
That's not me sharing about someone else.

1904
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:00,860
What?

1905
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:01,860
Oh.

1906
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:08,860
if the hooker was listening to the radio show. I didn't mean anything about it.

1907
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:12,500
Can we read the list now or should we just throw the list away?

1908
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:19,500
No, but I haven't read the top three. The climax of this whole segment. Surely you guys

1909
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:24,740
wouldn't let me get through a segment without climaxing. No guy would.

1910
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:28,740
Shirley Temple. Okay, go.

1911
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:43,080

The number two best bemoni drink is Vanilla Coke Icy.

1913
02:24:55,960 --> 02:25:02,520
The number one best Bemani drink of all time is...

02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:06,920
Pecari Sweat.

1915
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:08,480
Jamie is a winner.

1916
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:14,800
This is the second one I've gotten the first place on.

1917
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:20,400
Alright so there you go, that is the list.

1918
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,280
That's it, I know we still got a half hour of show left.

1919
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:23,960

yeah it's on so it's just you know go check out the rules because there's

1937
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:10,200
plenty of them

1938
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:13,820
he needed if they're really being strict about what they're doing this time so do

1939
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:15,800

1940
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,580
also there's another target going on it

1941
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:21,340
i'm not even sure it is

1942
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:27,340
I don't know, it's some other sim tournament that I really wasn't paying attention to.

1943
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:30,340
Yeah, it's out there too, so I'm sure someone will...

1944
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:35,340
Oh yes, and Make Edit Get Porn, that is still going on, so don't forget about that one.

1945
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:38,340
One thing I forgot to ask about the Make Edit Get Porn contest is,

1946
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:41,340
does everybody who enters get porn, or just the winners?

1947
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:42,340
Just the winners.

1948
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:43,340
Alright, just making sure.

1949
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:45,340
I was going to say, that's a lot of porn for you to be sending out.

1950
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:46,340
Oh, I could do it, but...

1951
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:47,340
Alright.

1952
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:48,340
So just the winners, just the top three.

1953
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:50,340
Just the winners will get porn, so...

1954
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:55,700
gets a little porn, second place gets... Nope, just first place. Oh, the first place

1955
02:26:55,700 --> 02:27:00,620
versus going to get all the porn? Yeah. That's a lot of porn. We'll see. We'll see how much

1956
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:04,840
porn I can acquire from... And we're going to have an honorary... You have to specify

1957
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:08,580
if you want girl porn or boy porn, because there is going to be a boy porn prize. Okay,

1958
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:11,480
well, not by me, but yeah, we'll figure something out. We'll find something. Orange Lounge will

1959
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:18,620
donate a boy porn prize. Okay. But anyways, yeah, Max Beats is the other one. That's the

1960
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:21,560
other contest going on there and it's like five categories enter there no

1961
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:27,320
prizes for that but yeah it's fun so go check that one out too and see other

1962
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:34,280
than that there's been some updates DWI finally decided to well update their

1963
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:39,140
stuff so now they're trying to play catch up there I guess playing catch up

1964
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:45,440
anyways they added the extra extra stage support for that which no stepping is

1965
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:52,440
They're still a good mile behind Stepmania.

1966
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:58,440
There are no updates on Stepmania, but it's pretty good so far, so just check it out.

1967
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:06,440
Other than that, DDRUK is putting together a lot of full full sets of files to download.

1968
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:10,440
They have full sets of Disney's Rave.

1969
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:16,440
Well, I have to say that it's not completely full, they're missing some of the double steps, but, I mean, for the most part...

1970
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,440
Yeah, it's just if you're being anal-retentive.

1971
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:29,440
Yes. For the most part, it's complete. They also have full sets of Euromix 1 and 2, all synced, and they have Clubmix, the club of pens on there.

1972
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:34,440
You're starting a fight here in the chatroom, StepMania versus DWI.

1973
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:36,440
Oh, I don't care.

1974
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:39,440
Let them fight! Let them kill each other!

1975
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:48,440
Anyway, go check that out, and I know for a fact, because I kind of helped, that there will be a DD, um, Ohasta.

1976
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:54,440
Ohasta rules. If we take another break before the end of the show, we'll play some Ohasta tracks.

1977
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:59,440
They're going to be releasing a pack for that pretty soon, so...

1978
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:02,440
I never did figure out the card thing in Ohasta.

1979
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:17,440
Have you ever done any of the Tokimeki songs?

1980
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:19,440
Yep, all of them.

1981
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:24,440
Okay, I still haven't figured out how to get to that point because I have Tokimeki 2.

1982
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:28,440
Yeah, I have all of them. I'm sure they'll be releasing a pack for that too.

1983
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:35,440
I'm actually considering entering tourneymix3, by the way. I have to ask you if my song's been used before, though, but I'll ask you off-air. The one I want to do.

1984
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:43,440
Well, I've already... yeah. See, this is what I've been doing today, is deciding which song I want to do. I've narrowed it down to a couple options.

1985
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:45,440
I already know, but I have a feeling it's been done.

1986
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:50,440
Okay, number one was Things of Mannery, and that was by Tack.

1987
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:52,440
You'll instantly get my vote.

1988
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:59,440
It's a six minute long song, I just cut it down to just over two minutes, two and a half minutes, so I have that one.

1989
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:05,440
I have an 80's track that's being remixed, which is so far in the lead in my picks.

1990
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:11,440
It's Amanda, originally by Boston, and it's covered by Brooklyn Queens. It's a Ford's Transmix.

1991
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:15,440
It's a really catchy song, so maybe we can play that later.

1992
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:17,440
Oh, I've heard of this album.

1993
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:18,440
So, it's pretty sweet.

1994
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:21,440
This is like another 80's trans- I'm gonna need to copy this before you leave, okay?

1995
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,440
Yeah, okay.

1996
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:24,440
It's got Journey on it, cool!

1997
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:25,440
Yeah.

1998
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:26,440
But it's not really Journey.

1999
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,440
It's like an update.

2000
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:30,440
I bought an album just like this the other- that's so crazy.

2001
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,440
Cool.

2002
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:32,440
What album did you get?

2003
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,440
I got one, it's called Time After Time.

2004
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:34,440
Damn it!

2005
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:35,440
That's the one I've been looking for!

2006
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:36,440
I got that one.

2007
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:37,440
I need to get a copy of that.

2008
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,440
Okay.

2009
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:39,440
Alright.

2010
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:40,440
Okay.

2011
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:53,440
Back on the subject here, also a random Beatmania track. I was looking at Hyperband or Alien World. I think that's by Ping Pong. It's from Beatmania the final, I think.

2012
02:30:53,440 --> 02:31:06,440
But I was deciding between one of those, but it's probably going to be Amanda, because it's just a catchy song. I don't think I've recognized the original, but it's just a catchy song, and it'll be fine.

2013
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:09,440
So now you're gonna get five people doing that because they all heard you were gonna do it.

2014
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,440
They're all gonna copy you.

2015
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:12,440
That's fine, whatever, I don't care.

2016
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:15,440
But yeah, has that ever happened in those contests where two people end up doing the same song?

2017
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:19,440
Yeah, um, there was one with, um, um, Mr. Larpus, I think.

2018
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:22,440
Um, that was Tranny Mix 1, they did that.

2019
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:23,440
Don't!

2020
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:24,440
And, uh...

2021
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,440
They both end up losing, huh?

2022
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:26,440
Yep.

2023
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:30,440
Because they cancel each other's votes out, so that's why I gotta make sure my song hasn't been done before.

2024
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:32,440
Yeah, so I'm doing that one, and, uh...

2025
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:43,440
And uh, it'll be pretty cool. I mean, I'm sure there'll be someone probably doing Sakura and someone probably doing Xenon, which those have been done. I mean, Sakura has 4,000 of them out there, so no one's gonna vote for that.

2026
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:55,440
And I'm sure bmoni ruler sneak one out. There's only one song that he has, um, that was being released in the last set of release ones that he didn't quite get out, and that was The Return.

2027
02:31:55,440 --> 02:32:00,680
My guess, if he was to enter and be lazy and not actually make a new file, it'd be he'd

2028
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:02,120
release the return.

2029
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:05,720
Which I heard is a really good trance track, but it's seven minutes long, so that's probably

2030
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,240
not going to happen.

2031
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:10,840
But you know, maybe, who knows.

2032
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:11,840
Really I don't care.

2033
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:12,840
We shall see.

2034
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:13,840
I don't really care.

2035
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:18,000
He bitches too much about making sim files, and you know, so then he enters-

2036
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,840
Didn't you already rant on this one week?

2037
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:22,840
I think you did, because I was going through archives today making that new intro.

2038
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:24,720
Yes, you did.

2039
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:27,720
Maybe. Numerous times, no.

2040
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:33,720
But yeah, also my site, of course gotta plug it again, leechfromloki.tk.

2041
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:41,720
Gonna be getting to a point where I'm gonna try to upload every single BeatMania song I have made right now by other people.

2042
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:44,720
I just got a few more the other day. I got Happy Wedding from...

2043
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:47,720
Happy Do, Happy Do, Happy Do.

2044
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:49,720
No, that's a different song. Okay.

2045
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:50,720
I thought that was Happy Wedding.

2046
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:56,720
Happy Wedding is the one that's like the rap over the piano music type thing, I don't remember.

2047
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:58,720
Oh, maybe it's the long version, I'm thinking of it.

2048
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,720
I don't know, whatever, anyways.

2049
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:07,720
Happy Wedding, and I know there's a few other ones I got files for, so I'll be trying to upload.

2050
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:13,720
I've got to reformat my whole pages to organize them in style groups and that type of thing,

2051
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:18,720
so I can actually start uploading them easier that way, but that's a lot of work.

2052
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:25,160
come see that next week. Maybe I'll try to upload something tonight. That's it. Oh, oh!

2053
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:32,220
And releases, as far as home releases, Dancing Stage Party Edition finally came out. Only

2054
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:38,500
problem is it has a huge freaking bug in it, which won't make it play on PS1s or Playstations,

2055
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:43,500
so that kind of sucks. It only plays on PS2s for some reason, even though it's a PS1 game.

2056
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:48,300
Whoops! Oopsie! You know, so that's not gonna... I want a copy of that, because I want to dance

2057
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:50,380
to uh... kylee minnow

2058
02:33:50,380 --> 02:33:54,940
jim i had walked eight you know what i'm sure that i had

2059
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:55,900
land

2060
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:56,560
land

2061
02:33:56,560 --> 02:34:00,020
and i was really like um... people there there are in

2062
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:03,200
now you can't wait and amar and that that's of the prior

2063
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:05,180
so you price is out there

2064
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:06,780
i want to crack the field

2065
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,460
but i think that's a

2066
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:11,820
they'll be not in the same and but i think that was just a very serious

2067
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:18,820
Tranpower can definitely vouch for the fact that the sim is safe after Shaft, yes.

2068
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:23,820
That's all the sim news right now, just keep looking, there's more stuff going on everywhere.

2069
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:31,820
I was looking online today to see if there was any new news with that Feed a Fury, the Dreamcast game we talked about a couple weeks ago, and no, there's not. I was kind of disappointed.

2070
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:05,060
I'll bring them next week I believe we you know what I think we did that one

2071
02:35:05,060 --> 02:35:09,220
episode you weren't here we went through it and we talked about Gameboy DDR music

2072
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:17,780
yes I've never been to 2d x-mities ah 2d x-mities that would be a fun show wow

2073
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:22,900
so what else going on DDR baumannii world right now anything shaft is over

2074
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:31,780
shaft is over I know some big news and that's coming up what yes okay well

2075
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:37,020
So we've got Southern Hills Golf Land is closing, that was one big news item that came out this

2076
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:42,540
week, Shiggle, one of the big golf lands, of course, popular guy, Shiggle Boss over

2077
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:49,060
on some of the message boards, and that place is closing.

2078
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:52,500
Apparently what's happened is the city council has rezoned that area to be some residential

2079
02:35:52,500 --> 02:35:57,220
housing, so Shiggle's going to be closing down, and who knows where those games will

2080
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:59,860
be going, probably to the Camelot Golf Land nearby.

2081
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:06,860
I was just going to mention that if anyone looked at their calendar this week, they would notice that the 20th falls on a Wednesday next week.

2082
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:10,860
And so 20 November, obviously you're going to have a bunch of new stuff going on in the DDR Spot.

2083
02:36:10,860 --> 02:36:14,860
Big Bahmani thing. I happen to know there's one major website relaunching on 20 November.

2084
02:36:14,860 --> 02:36:16,860
Yes, the number one...

2085
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:18,860
You'll know the spot to go to.

2086
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:24,860
Yes, ddrspot.com is relaunching starting on the 20th, so check that out.

2087
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:28,860
I know SoCalKicks' site just relaunched on the 15th.

2088
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:32,860
Actually, he had to cancel it. That was the big news. He had to cancel that.

2089
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:35,860
And he has a new tagline, by the way. I'll show this to you guys now.

2090
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:37,860
Because remember last week we were talking about the SoCalKicks tagline.

2091
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:43,860
And we love SoCalKicks because he did the Orange Lounge website, so we forever owe him sexual favors.

2092
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,860
No, you do.

2093
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:47,860
No, not just me. But see, now he has a new tagline.

2094
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:50,860
SCK accomplishes ultimate evolution just later.

2095
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:53,860
Instead of just now, it'll be just later.

2096
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:55,860
That's funny.

2097
02:36:55,860 --> 02:37:00,860
That kind of sucks for him. We'll hope that he can get his website back up soon.

2098
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:05,860
I know, but my style is going to be doing something and same with 2dxstyle.com.

2099
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:07,860
Oh, they're going to be doing some special shit.

2100
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:08,860
So check those out on Wednesday.

2101
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:12,860
And maybe OrangeLount Radio will do a special 20 November fuck off.

2102
02:37:12,860 --> 02:37:16,860
Oh, and you know what someone else is probably doing?

2103
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:24,860
Or I should say a certain somebody with a certain journal will be probably talking about 20 November as well since that does come out that day too.

2104
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:27,860
What about the 19th of November?

2105
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:28,860
Yeah.

2106
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:31,860
And everybody's neglecting 19 November, which is by far a better song.

2107
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:35,860
Dear diary, today is 19 November.

2108
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:39,860
Today is when I fap it furiously, because tomorrow Politary is coming to my house.

2109
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:42,860
And I'll put pictures of the internet in my journal.

2110
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:47,860
Speaking of journals, Jamie, you want to talk about the Orange Lounge Live Journal community that we have going now?

2111
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:52,860
Yes. I set this up last Sunday right after the show.

2112
02:37:52,860 --> 02:37:56,380
If you go to livejournal.com

2113
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:59,620
slash users slash orange lounge

2114
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:04,120
that is our orange lounge community and if you wish to join it's open access however if

2115
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,900
you fuck it up we'll kick your ass out.

2116
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:09,540
And what kind of post will we expect to be seeing in the orange

2117
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:12,860
lounge live journal community? Random shit. Just like this show.

2118
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:15,880
Well basically you know those of us who have something to contribute to the show or the

2119
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:16,820
big money community

2120
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:19,980
or even things that have been slightly related like I posted deep thoughts in there

2121
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:21,660
because we did talk about it last week

2122
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:27,840
Or just, you know, things about the show, you know, we announced the time changes, different

2123
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,840
things.

2124
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:29,840
You know, go ahead and join up.

2125
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,920
And make sure, by the way, that you actually join the community instead of set it to watch.

2126
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:37,560
That way if you join the community, you can post to it.

2127
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:41,240
Also, everybody who is a member of the community is also on the friends list page.

2128
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:42,760
But again, don't fuck it up.

2129
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:44,760
Yeah, you fuck it up, your ass is out.

2130
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:48,720
Yeah, but please post because I think there's about five or six posts right now.

2131
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:50,720
There's five, but there's plenty on the friends list.

2132
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:56,100
We don't want to flood it though, so join, you don't have to post every day, but when

2133
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:58,980
you have something orange loungy to say, post it.

2134
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:03,300
I hate to disappoint everybody, but I don't know if I'd update my live journal ever.

2135
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:04,660
Well now you have a reason to.

2136
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:09,940
No, because the only time I talk in the live journal is like, guess what, my sim has a

2137
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,660
thousand songs now!

2138
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:14,780
Guess what, my sim has a thousand and five songs now!

2139
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:18,500
So it's just like...

2140
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:22,060
I have a question from the chat room, how exactly do I join the community?

2141
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:25,100
Well, all you have to do, go to the info page.

2142
02:39:25,100 --> 02:39:29,340
When you go to the Orangetox community, there's an info page, and it'll say right at the top,

2143
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:34,420
oh yeah, user info, if you want to join this community, click here.

2144
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:38,780
And you want to list it as a friend, one of your friends.

2145
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:42,400
If you just list it as a friend, you're only going to be watching it, you haven't actually

2146
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:45,580
joined it.

2147
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:50,620
If you go to the profile and hit the click here link to join the community, it will give

2148
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:54,220
you the option to set it as part of your friends list automatically, so you don't have to click

2149
02:39:54,220 --> 02:39:58,100
the separate button on the profile page.

2150
02:39:58,100 --> 02:39:59,100
Thank you.

2151
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:00,660
And we have a link posted in the chat room.

2152
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:04,920
And another question, why can't we make it on U-Journal?

2153
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:07,380
Because everything else is just a rip-off of Live Journal.

2154
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:09,900
Actually, Live Journal is open source.

2155
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:13,580
Live Journal is open source, so everything else basically rips off it.

2156
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:17,580
If you really, really need a LiveJournal code, I've got a few extra, maybe...

2157
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:21,580
I have a couple. If I think you don't suck, I'll give you one.

2158
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:25,580
Yeah, PM me on a forum you know I'm on, and MAYBE I'll give you a code.

2159
02:40:25,580 --> 02:40:29,580
We'll see. MAYBE. MAYBE.

2160
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:33,580
Possibly. Okay, well, other news. Any more money?

2161
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:37,580
Um, no, but I was gonna say that if you ever catch me in the chat room,

2162
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:41,580
you can almost guarantee that I'll be throwing up random porn links every now and then.

2163
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:48,580
I've never seen you in there.

2164
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:50,660
Loki comes in at about midnight.

2165
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:52,460
Like seriously, it's a very late night.

2166
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:54,380
Look at this chat room statistics page.

2167
02:40:54,380 --> 02:40:55,380
He is on there.

2168
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:57,460
Just very late at night.

2169
02:40:57,460 --> 02:41:00,500
He's on there at the under 80 posts, I think.

2170
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:02,300
Yes, one of the low posters.

2171
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:04,020
He's like, fine, I'm going to post.

2172
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:08,300
I think I've seen the channel like twice, okay?

2173
02:41:08,300 --> 02:41:09,300
I've been in there.

2174
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:10,300
I was in there last night.

2175
02:41:10,300 --> 02:41:12,300
He's in there more often than I am

2176
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:15,240
Yeah, well, I'm in there like more often than all y'all

2177
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:20,160
Remember that one time I did the whole like, you know, I'm making a sim file while I'm chatting thing? Remember?

2178
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:21,540
Yeah, that was what?

2179
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:25,840
A big thank you by the way to all our chatters in the chat room tonight. We've been had a record

2180
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:28,940
We were pushing 20 people there at one point in the chat room. So thanks you guys

2181
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:29,800
You guys are cool

2182
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:31,800
Blowing shit up in our chat room

2183
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:33,800
I used to go in the chat room more often and so I got scared

2184
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:38,480
Yeah, I mean there's a lot of if you look at the stats a lot of people are starting to idle more throughout the day and just

2185
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:44,200
Talk at random points throughout the day. So that's what it is. So just come join our chat room

2186
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,240
for a recent accomplishments that passed many double Oni's because

2187
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:51,200
RVGL's

2188
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:55,460
Max to machine was on free play. So yeah. Yeah, it was on free play because

2189
02:41:56,080 --> 02:42:00,760
Every Saturday morning they turn all the machines on free play and after they go around to each one by hand

2190
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:05,980
So I guess they forgot happens and so I got to be lots of ones like template change and stuff. That's cool

2191
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:11,960
Well, we're going to take another really quick break and we're going to come back and we're

2192
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:16,680
going to wrap up the show with final thoughts and maybe another quick topic.

2193
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:17,680
Oh, yes.

2194
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:18,680
Look, before we break.

2195
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:19,680
Really quick last minute.

2196
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,680
It's kind of an F you that I forgot earlier.

2197
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:22,680
Oh, boy.

2198
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:23,680
Don't worry.

2199
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,680
Okay.

2200
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:30,760
It's a big F you to RVGL's ticket counting machine because the damn thing sucks in the

2201
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:35,920
tickets and it's just all boop, boop, boop, like it'll suck in 20 tickets and count two.

2202
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:39,920
So because they're stupid and lazy and don't have to do it, that's why they do it.

2203
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,920
Alright, that's it.

2204
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:43,920
Alright. Thank you very much.

2205
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:48,920
We're going to take a quick break. We're going to start it off, as promised, with some Ohasta DDR.

2206
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:53,920
An Ohasta DDR track, and then we're going to play...

2207
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:55,920
What did you want, Jamie? You wanted Total Recall?

2208
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:57,920
Total Recall. From Beatmania Fiskmix.

2209
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,920
And then we will be back.

2210
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:07,920
So, we'll be back very soon.

2211
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:24,920
The early bird gets the worm!

2212
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:25,920
Yeah!

2213
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:27,920
I only stand so high for me

2214
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:30,920
So high, make me ready for me

2215
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:32,920
Woo!

2216
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,920
Woo!

2217
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:38,920
Woo!

2218
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:40,920
Come on, get it!

2219
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:41,920
Woo!

2220
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:43,920
Come on, get it!

2221
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,920
Make the beat pound

2222
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,920
Come on, get it!

2223
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:49,920
Make the beat pound

2224
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,920
Come on, get it!

2225
02:45:51,920 --> 02:46:08,920
Amanda! Amanda! Amanda! Amanda!

2226
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:33,920
Tomorrow's so far away, there's something I just have to say

2227
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:41,920
I don't think I can hide what I'm feeling inside another day

2228
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:44,920
Knowing I love you

2229
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,920
I hope you know I do

2230
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:54,920
And I'm getting too close again

2231
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:58,920
I don't wanna see it end

2232
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,920
If I tell you tonight

2233
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:03,920
Will you turn up the light

2234
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:05,920
And walk away

2235
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,920
Knowing I love you

2236
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:38,920
Oh Amanda, I'm gonna kill you right away, I can't wait another day

2237
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:20,920
And I feel like today's the day I'm lookin' for my words today

2238
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:27,920
Do you wanna be free? Are you ready for me to feel this way?

2239
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:35,920
I don't wanna lose you No, no, no, no, no

2240
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:40,920
Oh, you made me soon, I know

2241
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:45,920
Feelings take so long to grow

2242
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:49,920
If I tell you to take what you've done to me

2243
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:52,920
And let me go

2244
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:56,920
I don't wanna lose you

2245
02:48:56,920 --> 02:49:00,920
No, no, no, no, no, no

2246
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:07,920
I'm gonna take you on these crimes and make you realize I'm a man of love

2247
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:11,920
I'm gonna tell you right away I can't wait another day

2248
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:14,920
I'm a man of love

2249
02:49:14,920 --> 02:49:21,920
I'm gonna say it like I can and make you understand I'm a man of love

2250
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:27,920
I'm fine but I love you

2251
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:34,880
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

2252
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:36,680
us on all the fun together.

2253
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:40,520
But hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

2254
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:43,960
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

2255
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:46,480
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

2256
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:51,320
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

2257
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:56,120
Hey, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, season premiere, episode number 20, and Loki,

2258
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:59,120
Do you want to remind our chatroom what that last song was that we just heard?

2259
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:02,120
That last song was the song I'm doing for Turny Mix, probably.

2260
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:05,120
But you're going to edit that down a little.

2261
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:10,120
Well, I actually have an edited down version. I thought I burned it on the CD, but that's the CD I listened to in the car, so I guess not.

2262
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:17,120
That's Amanda, which was originally done by the 80's group Boston, and this new version is done by Brooklyn Queens.

2263
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:23,120
It's a Ford's Trance mix, and can be found on Vic Latino Presents 80's Now.

2264
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:26,680
CD that was on sale at Tower, so go check it out. It's pretty good, but I'd probably

2265
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:28,960
recommend Time After Time, which is the CD I was looking for.

2266
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:34,400
I don't know. It's okay. It's okay. I bought it. But it's okay.

2267
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:39,920
I was on 80 Music Kick after, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City, so I just had

2268
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:41,440
to get some Remix City stuff.

2269
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:46,560
What is up with this Grand Theft Auto Vice City thing? I never played those games, so...

2270
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:51,040
Okay. Dance Door was a fucking nightmare the day that game came out. It was full of all

2271
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:55,840
stupid people but the CDs oh my god the CDs are awesome because they have you

2272
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:59,500
know and when you're playing GTA you can change the station and you have the the

2273
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:04,880
DJ come up and they say something funny well the DJ's are on the CDs introducing

2274
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:10,000
some of the tracks the Latino one is absolutely hilarious yes and there's a

2275
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:16,360
new wave one too which I like so so we're coming into the final home

2276
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:20,080
stretch of the show I thought maybe we go around and talk about our best

2277
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:26,280
Spumani moment of the week maybe our big yes of the week since shaft picked up

2278
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:31,360
like just in play 2d x like but but what'd you do I passed fantasy in like

2279
02:51:31,360 --> 02:51:37,200
seven so there you go okay I'm you know I'm always slow on so on the big money

2280
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:41,800
games I will admit it but I had been trying to beat fantasy on light seven

2281
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:46,680
forever it was one of two songs I had left to do on fourth style and I've been

2282
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:53,720
getting 76, 78, 76, 78. I beat it with a 90% today, so I'm happy. And I'm getting there

2283
02:51:53,720 --> 02:52:00,480
on get on beat. And I almost beat voltage today.

2284
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:07,400
Very cool. Any Bahmani moments of the week you would like to share with us?

2285
02:52:07,400 --> 02:52:13,360
I didn't really do anything other than download shit off the internet. That was Bahmani related.

2286
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:19,800
I downloaded more sim files to add something like 1588 now or something like that.

2287
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:25,960
But yeah, that's pretty much all I did, reorganize my sim stuff, updated some of my files with

2288
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:28,960
full sets instead of just the partial shit I had.

2289
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:36,720
And that's about it, I mean, update my website, fix some links and shit, direct this guy who

2290
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:41,840
couldn't speak to find MP3s, so like I said.

2291
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:46,140
black lab yes

2292
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:49,460
besides the obvious part of me now being a bitch

2293
02:52:49,460 --> 02:52:52,240
of 2dx6 style

2294
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:57,380
and 5th style and 4th style yes that's true and third style

2295
02:52:57,380 --> 02:53:01,300
which didn't have celebrate I couldn't find celebrate maybe I just don't have it unlocked yet

2296
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:04,580
anyway anyways

2297
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:08,620
let's see other than that I haven't done shit

2298
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:10,300
bmani wise

2299
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:14,920
haven't been to arcades, haven't been to tapioca express to play

2300
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:18,440
i really didn't play that much bmani when i went to

2301
02:53:18,440 --> 02:53:20,160
went home over the weekend

2302
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:22,160
and yeah

2303
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:25,460
i'm deprived, help me please

2304
02:53:25,460 --> 02:53:28,060
oh, jamie has another one she wants to share

2305
02:53:28,060 --> 02:53:30,020
i full combo'd cowgirl

2306
02:53:30,020 --> 02:53:32,180
rad

2307
02:53:32,180 --> 02:53:35,140
gallops are one of my weakest things

2308
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:39,060
go over for Boba and you beat it then? No, this was right after Shaft. I was damn

2309
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:41,580
tired, exhausted, and hardly got to eat anything.

2310
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:44,440
So right before they were going to take the machine off of event mode,

2311
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:48,420
I was like, fuck all of you, I'm going to play, okay? Dammit, I've been running

2312
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:49,420
back and forth

2313
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:51,260
just so that you people could have a good time,

2314
02:53:51,260 --> 02:53:53,860
which I'm glad everyone did, and I was really happy.

2315
02:53:53,860 --> 02:53:55,580
I'm going to play DDR, hell!

2316
02:53:55,580 --> 02:53:58,140
So I played cowgirl, and I full combo'd it.

2317
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:02,700
While I was dead tired, and then I went home and took a Vicodin.

2318
02:54:02,700 --> 02:54:04,400
You took some drugs!

2319
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:29,400
I actually don't know why I came up with this anyway, so I don't have any of the money news to report. I barely played any at all. I played a little 2DX, I haven't passed shit, new, I'm still stuck at the same point I was. I keep fucking up like the last few measures of V, otherwise I could pass the goddamn song on 7 key. I haven't really passed anything else. I'm getting closer to DXY, that's about it.

2320
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:34,500
personally so I guess it's about it we got only a few minutes left in the show

2321
02:54:34,500 --> 02:54:37,620
let's go around and get everybody's final worse Dave get Dave in here we

2322
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:44,820
have to get final thought so what did he

2323
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:53,820
okay so let's talk about everybody's final thought for today

2324
02:54:53,820 --> 02:54:55,820
I'll go final.

2325
02:54:55,820 --> 02:54:57,820
I'll go final.

2326
02:54:57,820 --> 02:54:58,820
You'll go final.

2327
02:54:58,820 --> 02:54:59,820
Loki, your final thought?

2328
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:05,820
Um, definitely be watching the Fries ads because they've been having a lot of good stuff really

2329
02:55:05,820 --> 02:55:06,820
cheap lately.

2330
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:10,820
I mean, you can't beat, if I didn't want to stick with the name-brand Yamaha, you know,

2331
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:16,820
I could have gone with the verbatim CDR burner for $19, a 40-speed CD burner.

2332
02:55:16,820 --> 02:55:17,820
Let's just put it this way.

2333
02:55:17,820 --> 02:55:22,820
40 speed, I put my shoes on today while I was burning the CD, the CD burner finished

2334
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:29,260
burning my CD before my shoes were on. I mean, that's just crazy shit right there. So, definitely

2335
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:33,180
check that stuff out. Watch my site later this week. There should be some updates, I

2336
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:38,580
hope, if I get around to it. I've been kind of busy. And, yeah, that kind of shit. So,

2337
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:41,900
watch that. Look for Turny Mix because you're going to have a lot of cool files to download

2338
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:47,420
there and, yeah, just that kind of stuff. Have fun.

2339
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:50,000
Glad be a final thought for today.

2340
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,060
Let's me think.

2341
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:56,420
I have a paper due tomorrow morning that I need to finish when I get home.

2342
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:58,080
Slacker.

2343
02:55:58,080 --> 02:56:00,060
Damn right I am.

2344
02:56:00,060 --> 02:56:01,840
And uh... let's see.

2345
02:56:01,840 --> 02:56:05,420
The next time Twinz says back suck, I'm going to go down to Florida and take one of those

2346
02:56:05,420 --> 02:56:09,660
puck mice from the early IMAX and shove it up his ass.

2347
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:10,740
We don't want to go

2348
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:12,020
to that area.

2349
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:13,100
I don't want to know about

2350
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:16,420
things going up Twinz's ass.

2351
02:56:16,420 --> 02:56:19,100
Hey, I mean, uh, I don't know.

2352
02:56:19,100 --> 02:56:20,100
Mac?

2353
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:21,100
Rob!

2354
02:56:21,100 --> 02:56:24,100
I'm not done with my final thought yet, dammit.

2355
02:56:24,100 --> 02:56:25,100
You dammit.

2356
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:26,100
Um.

2357
02:56:26,100 --> 02:56:27,100
Dammit?

2358
02:56:27,100 --> 02:56:29,660
You maybe forgot what I was gonna say.

2359
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:30,660
Wrong text.

2360
02:56:30,660 --> 02:56:31,660
Yeah.

2361
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:32,660
Uh.

2362
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:33,660
Whatever.

2363
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:35,220
Yeah, I had fun tonight.

2364
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:37,220
Yee, go me.

2365
02:56:37,220 --> 02:56:38,220
No.

2366
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:39,220
No, Loki.

2367
02:56:39,220 --> 02:56:42,220
You're done.

2368
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:43,220
I let him talk.

2369
02:56:43,220 --> 02:56:44,220
Loki.

2370
02:56:44,220 --> 02:56:54,220
Expect some more Guitar Freak's 7th and 8th music and also popping music stuff to be appearing in our playlists later this week. Check it out.

2371
02:56:54,220 --> 02:57:06,220
We actually already have some 8th and 7th in there, but Popping Music, per that email, we ordered our albums and we got them. Wink wink. So we'll be adding the popping music stuff like we promised we would this week.

2372
02:57:06,220 --> 02:57:10,220
And um, the Paula Tamberry's, uh, the Paula Terry ban is over now, so...

2373
02:57:10,220 --> 02:57:11,220
No, no it's not!

2374
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:13,220
Oh, we're gonna ban her for another week?

2375
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:15,220
We'll ban her for a month.

2376
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:16,220
We'll ban her till next year.

2377
02:57:16,220 --> 02:57:19,220
Alright, so uh, Paula Terry's banned for the rest of the year.

2378
02:57:19,220 --> 02:57:27,220
Um, and uh, my final thought is, uh, I still need a date, but it looks like I might have one this week, so that's cool.

2379
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:29,220
Oooooooh!

2380
02:57:29,220 --> 02:57:30,220
And um, shut up.

2381
02:57:30,220 --> 02:57:35,220
And uh, I guess that's it, I need to go play DDR because I'm getting fat.

2382
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:37,220
I don't like being fat.

2383
02:57:38,220 --> 02:57:39,220
That's it.

2384
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:41,220
Jamie, your final thought?

2385
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:43,220
That's it.

2386
02:57:43,220 --> 02:57:45,220
That's it, that's your final thought?

2387
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:49,220
I guess Dave doesn't have final thought. Dave loses.

2388
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:49,220
Dave doesn't have a single thought in his head.

2389
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:53,220
Dave doesn't have a thought in his head.

2390
02:57:56,220 --> 02:57:58,220
Dave's final thought, oh yeah Dave pressed one.

2391
02:57:58,220 --> 02:58:00,220
So what do you guys think of…

2392
02:58:00,220 --> 02:58:01,600

2407
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:41,880

2408
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:42,440
at the

2409
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:45,160
yeah we're training

2410
02:58:45,160 --> 02:58:48,520
i was very disappointed there's no gilligan's island music in the intro

2411
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:52,720
do to do to do i thought about it but that's so cliche i i promoted it is the

2412
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:54,940
three hour tour so i was about it

2413
02:58:54,940 --> 02:58:57,880
what you think of three hours

2414
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,780
at the hell of a lot better when you're actually in here

2415
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:05,500
and even though it's kind of a small room it's a hell of a lot better

2416
02:59:05,500 --> 02:59:07,260
it's sitting down on my computer

2417
02:59:07,260 --> 02:59:09,060
and my ass getting numb

2418
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:11,220
from not moving

2419
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:12,400
but yeah otherwise that's cool

2420
02:59:12,400 --> 02:59:15,480
it would have been better if we had a lot more bimani news going on but

2421
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:18,100
since everyone was kind of like nope

2422
02:59:18,100 --> 02:59:21,100
maybe we'll get out and do some interviews this week so I'll have something to talk about next week

2423
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:29,780
I am very scared of the best of tape that you're going to put together here, but...

2424
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:30,780
Coming soon.

2425
02:59:30,780 --> 02:59:31,780

Do your worst.

2427
02:59:32,780 --> 02:59:35,980
And next week we need three microphones, just thought I'd mention that.

02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:43,420
The magic phone box, too.

2433
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:44,420
We can't do that.

2434
02:59:44,420 --> 02:59:46,420
We'll see what we can do.

2435
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:47,420
All right.

2436
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:48,420
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2437
02:59:48,420 --> 02:59:49,420
Thanks for going to take a nap.

We appreciate your support.

2439
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:56,420
And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
