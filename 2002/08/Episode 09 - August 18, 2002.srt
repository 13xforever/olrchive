00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All your days are belong to us.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content, and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
One, two, one, two, three, four, three, two, one.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy wave? You bitch!

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Bitch!

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,300
Now let me check that this goes 2-1-2, fuck you!

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,000
You have no morals, darling.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,500
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun in the scorching case of her case.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Mecha lecha hai, mecha hiney hoe.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Me too!

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
Ugh!

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Fucker, yeah?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm working on it.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Loser.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Lame!

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm as fine as my face.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Breathing.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Breathless.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Heaving.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Breath.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Heaving.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Whatever.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I am your singing hologram.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
You're tuned in to the Bamani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things B.E. Mani.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,900
i think the money because i get criticized i don't think the body like

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,080

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,900
i'll get criticized i don't think the money

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,200

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,260

this is episode number nine four

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,920
August 18th of 2002, and I know we've probably got a lot of new listeners tonight tuning

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,140
in for the coverage of the Dollar Mandy Tournament, and I'm pleased to announce we do have all

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,960
the interviews ready to broadcast for you all tonight, so we are going to bring you

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,140
some exclusive audio coverage and interviews of the tournament of the summer, do you think?

44
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
The tournament of the summer, Jayna?

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,140
It's probably the best fun one I've been to all summer, although I've missed some of the

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,540
past few wins, but it was really just a fun experience overall.

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,180
of the tournament

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,320
uh... courses always report joined by many many in studio friends actually

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,280

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,600

very proud of you if you get a gold star for attendance

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,920
and in that break we're going to have an original version of a famous DDR song,

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,420
which I'm sure y'all are going to enjoy.

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,920

No, we're not having Britney Spears!

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
No, Britney!

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
But we can get petite love!

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Oh

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:09,920
It's the first time in my life that I've known you since you've been here

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I've been waiting for you since you've been here

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Oh

Money, money, money, money

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Tonight, I'll try to let you remember All the times that we were happy

71
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,920
That we were happy together, sing a song

72
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,920
You and me can be singing tonight

73
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Such pleasure, come on

74
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920

Flotation, feel the flow

78
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,040
It's time to let yourself go

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,660
Oh, let yourself go

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Love the night, release the seven senses

Lose control, control

90
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Let yourself go

91
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Temptation

92
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
It's time to let yourself go

93
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600

Flatation

Just let yourself go

98
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Just let yourself

Just let yourself

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Let yourself go

108
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Feel the flow

109
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
It's time to let yourself go

110
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Feel the flow now

111
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Lose control

112
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Let yourself go

113
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Flotation

114
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Let the, let yourself go

115
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Flotation

116
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Feel the flow now, flow now

117
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Feel the flow

119
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
It's time to let yourself go

120
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Flotation

121
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Lose control

122
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Let yourself go

123
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

124
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,100
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

125
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,980
A real radio makes Jamie cry, too.

126
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,220
The chat room demanded more promos last week, so we got some together for this week.

127
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Just a few, though.

128
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,220
They did a special one, just because you guys bitched.

129
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,900
So anyway, and now they're bitching in chat room, we're just going to have to make a new

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,300
one for them, because they're not capable, apparently.

131
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,020
In that set, you heard some of the former members of Morning MasumÃ© have their own

132
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,620
little group uh... you wanna brown money thank you because i would have fed up

133
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,860
and uh... the original version of the deal of called to go to the top

134
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,540
took the total

135
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,160
uh... after that was the vocal version of the song into the exit

136
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,540
brings the closest orgasm flotation

137
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,100
by vincent amore the man

138
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,140
you're listening to katie m i radio don't i was kidding if you really

139
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,340
believe that honestly i think the years that great anyway i'd like to let

140
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,460
himself go

141
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:30,780
rotation. Tonight's radio program is very last minute. I've been given a lot of things

142
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,740
at the last minute. We're beginning a lot of news at the last minute, a lot of new MP3s

143
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,220
to play for you here at the last minute, and of course, we got the tapes from yesterday's

144
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,980
Dollar Mendy tournament, and we've got those interviews we're going to be airing for you.

145
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,920
We got that all put together at the last minute. I was a microphone hoe-er. But you got some

146
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,680
Some great interviews, Jamie, so we're going to be hearing that about the show.

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,080
We split it up into three parts, so we'll be playing a bunch of it throughout the show.

148
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,780
I want to start off the show with something I was just given literally two minutes before

149
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
we went on air.

150
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,540
It's a link to a post over on the, I love this name for a board, the DJ Trunks Owned

151
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,600
You board.

152
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
And this is a possible Max 3 song list.

153
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,160
I don't know the validity of it, of course I don't think any of us know at this point,

154
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:30,160
When did Captain Jack do a remix to Take Me Out to the Ballgame?

155
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,040
From what I remember, there's a Dance Mania sports album that's out now, and that's when

156
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,680
the song's on.

157
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,880
At least we didn't get the Baja Man with Who Let the Dogs Out, which was also on that CD.

158
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,200
That song would have been cool for DDR.

159
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
That song would have been ass for DDR.

160
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
You are in the minority, sir.

161
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,160
Now what I'm disappointed in is 9-1-1, I love their Friday Night song, but more than a woman,

162
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,460
Friday Night rocks it.

163
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,920
One interesting entry I see here, Eiffel 65 with Blue is on this list.

164
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,000
That's one that should have been in DDR maybe three years ago.

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
Go ahead and read off the list.

166
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,960
Okay, I'm going to read off what I can here.

167
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,520
We got Never End by Yoma Komawatsu, Midnight Town by the Divas, Secret Rendezvous, Baby

168
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Give Me Love, those songs.

169
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,720
Red the Fire by Scotty D, who I don't think has done anything since Drop the Bomb, correct?

170
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,800
No, he did something on 2DX.

171
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Next, you did...

172
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, he did the track with Magoo, stick around.

173
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Celtic music, Revenge vs. Desire, that's going to be very cool, as long as it doesn't sound

174
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,800
like Enya, because Enya facilitates release, as we've said on other shows.

175
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:48,080
B For You, of course, returns, hooray, with a song called Crazy Sound, which I've used

176
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,880
to describe B For You in the past.

177
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,280
max the xxxium

178
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,220
i have no idea that sounds a little lame to me but maybe who knows

179
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,660
uh...

180
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,820
love to

181
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
i don't know there's some japanese text in here i can't i can't get to

182
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,840
unfortunately i don't think i have the text expansion

183
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,480
uh... that's the one song that was in your mix

184
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
okay cool

185
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,100
uh... three two one stars

186
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
What?

187
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,100
If this list is true, we've got the 3-2-1 stars in there.

188
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
That would so work.

189
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Colors, Glorious Days, A, Le More et Libre, Kiss Kiss Kiss, and Mobo Moga.

190
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Yeah, you could just say Love and Liberty.

191
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Okay.

192
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Le More et Le Libre.

193
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,140
Stream, Mosque Nada, Bus Stop, Owner of A Lonely Heart, Venus, Sunshine In Our Music,

194
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:57,860
New York City Boy, What's Up 2000 by DJ Nico, New York City Boy by Pet Shop Boys, and Nancy

195
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,940
and the Boys with SOS.

196
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,140
I wonder if that's the same Dr. Bombay SOS or if we're talking like ABBA SOS or what?

197
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,300
If it's ABBA SOS, that would be cool.

198
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,940
DJ Chaos with Sweet Desire and DJ Magical with Rush Hour.

199
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,760
already in the chat room, some people think it's fake, some people think it's real. Take

200
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,920
it for what it's worth. If that was the real thing, remember you heard it here first. If

201
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
it was fake, oops, our bad, you know, blame the chat room.

202
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,320
Well, let me just put it this way. Max the XXXM?

203
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,420
That's the one that kind of, of course, they're saying in the chat room it's actually called

204
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,200
Max Infinity by Sigma. I don't know.

205
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Okay, well, Max Infinity sounds better. Max XXXM is really retarded.

206
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,680
Yeah. It's like, porno Max.

207
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,440
It writes the short best.

208
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,600
It's the promo for the new movie with Vin Diesel or something.

209
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,120
God no.

210
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,100
So there you go, possible Max 3 song list.

211
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,240
Let's see, what else did I want to get to? We have some...

212
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,320
Well speaking of Max 3, you know that Euro Mix 2 just came out recently,

213
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,280
and there were some new songs on Euro Mix 2 that are assumed to be

214
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,800
in Max 3, and I've got one of those songs that was just sent to me, and I

215
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,320
I haven't even pulled this up myself to listen to it.

216
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
I'm told the quality isn't the best,

217
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
but we'll play a little bit of it for you here.

218
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
If it's pretty good quality,

219
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,600
we'll even play the whole thing.

220
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,840
If it's kind of crappy quality, we won't play very much.

221
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,680
But let's listen to it.

222
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,800
This is Naoki featuring Polteri with Memories.

223
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,840
Oh, God.

224
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,720
Are you ready?

225
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
Here we go!

226
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm keeping the mics on for this,

227
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,040
for a live comment. No fucking Polteri, please.

228
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,400
Okay, so far I'm digging it.

229
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Wow, it's Destiny all over again.

230
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Why can't that woman hold a key?

231
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Her voice is pretty good in this, so it's not as noisy as it might be.

232
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Let's see if they've read it through a mixer.

233
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
It's fun to play people singing with her.

234
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,900
I have to let you go

235
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
I just want you to know

236
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Can you hear the cheering?

237
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I have to support

238
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
The one I love

239
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Super performance

240
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,400
That's a new one for you, Missy

241
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Super performance

242
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I

243
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You all think that's a

244
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
You are very good at that.

245
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
We have some stuff for you.

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Pretty good.

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Let me fuck your dick.

248
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
The one for love is

249
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I only have to let you go.

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
I just want you to know.

251
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I was like Polteri like Naoki's third head or something.

252
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Or like second head or something like that.

253
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,400
The rumor is Polteri is giving Naoki head actually.

254
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
For fights versa, that song has been lifted from like two or three other songs.

255
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Yeah, it doesn't sound that bad compared to half the other stuff.

256
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
But I'd play it if it had a good step chart. I don't know.

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Yeah, I think it's going to depend on the step chart. I like it though.

258
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Compared to most of their collaborations, that's on the higher end for me.

259
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Well, she doesn't sound like total ass, so it's okay.

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It could have been a lot worse. It could have been, I don't know, anything else.

261
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
She just can't sing very well. I'm sorry.

262
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,560
They're commenting in the chatroom. They're not even commenting about that song. They're saying,

263
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,440
God, the announcer got worse.

264
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,960
You are a super performer!

265
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
Alright, let's get to the first part of those interviews, shall we?

266
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,120
Let's hear some of the interviews from Dollar Mendy's... Well, let's talk about it,

267
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,400
because some of you guys went. I unfortunately, I really wanted to go to this tournament,

268
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,820
but I did have some... Somebody went to Cuzar.

269
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,040
I had some previous commitments that I had to do. Somebody went to Cuzar. So I didn't get to go.

270
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,280
Well, let's hear it. Excuse me.

271
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,280
He had to go run off the Q's hour with Paul over. He's stupid. He's like, oh PA is boring.

272
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
We were loyal. We raped the crane machine.

273
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Yeah, me and DarkSakura. Sorry, I forgot your name for a second. No.

274
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Get out.

275
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm old. I'm old. Yes, in my own special way. No, I won like 15 prizes off that game and I don't know how many she won.

276
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
A bunch. I was giving them away all day.

277
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,760
But PA got kind of boring because since it was on doubles everything went twice as slow

278
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,360
and giving everyone a qualifying practice round made it even longer and more boring.

279
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,280
But I made it through the qualifying round.

280
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,560
It got pretty intense once they started running through those homemade only courses though.

281
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,240
That was pretty insane.

282
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,160
Meanwhile, the cues are.

283
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,800
No, no cues are.

284
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,660
It was fun.

285
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,940
It was fun, but when I came back, freestyle was cool.

286
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,140
I have to say, my favorite part of the tournament had to have been Ruben's little intermission

287
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,340
stuff in between performers.

288
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,140
That was great.

289
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:35,240
After twenty people did Spin the Disc, he did a Spin the Disc freestyle with his stop-dropping

290
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,400
roll move halfway through the song, which was one of the highlights, along with Corey's

291
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
head spin.

292
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,280
Corey's head spin was the winner of the show.

293
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
That was awesome.

294
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
There were some really good routines, but I think I can get into that a little bit later.

295
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,200
One of the judges gave him a hundred and wrote, oh my god, head spin, and that was their card.

296
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I gave Ruben a negative sixty-nine for his routine.

297
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,600
That's pretty cool.

298
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,240
But in PA, just throw out some who won stuff.

299
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,520
For PA, Jimmy came in first, and I forget who came in second, or emphasis.

300
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I have all of the stuff.

301
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,920
Emphasis, Jimmy came in first, and Jazz came in third.

302
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Nope.

303
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
Second was radical.

304
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,120
I have the results right here, if you'll give me a second to pull everything up.

305
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,280
Of course this is taken from a DDR Freak.

306
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,420
For PA, first place, we have Emphasis, who I also noticed, I guess, is newly inducted

307
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
into RTF.

308
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
So, congratulations.

309
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Whatever.

310
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,320
Second place, Radical of Ass.

311
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,980
Third from Step Squad, we have Jazz, my Nike Neko Jazz.

312
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,060
Fourth was Chubbs.

313
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:48,260
For Group Freestyle, first place was Hypnotics and One Wish Mike or Boogaloo Shrimp I guess

314
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
going by now.

315
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,020
Second was DK Angel Wings of Step Squad and Kit Hero.

316
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,700
Third place was Marky Mark and Tommy L. I'm just reading off the list, I'm sorry.

317
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,540
For Comedy First Place, we have Mr. Wendell and Fancy Lala, who's his niece, that was

318
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,980
a very, very cute routine to Cowgirl.

319
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,340
have for single freestyle. First was Fuzzy Hat, second was Mr. Wendell, third was Rain

320
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:23,980
of RTS, and fourth was DK Angel Wing's dad, who got up there and just did some amazing

321
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,820
last minute freestyle. That was the coolest thing ever. That was probably the third coolest

322
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,580
thing about the tournament. He just got up and started like, he was better than almost

323
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,020
everyone else, and he made it up on the spot. That was awesome. But, you know, Fuzzy Hat's

324
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,340
the man because he had fire. Yeah, he used candles for raving. He did, he did a really

325
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:48,720
nice routine to healing vision and Wendell's was to center the heart, which I thought was

326
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,620
very, very well presented. Very funny. Of course, I was a judge. Actually, I was going

327
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,660
to ask you, Jamie, as a judge for the tournament, and awesome, I'm glad you got to participate

328
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,780
in that, what did you think of the level of freestyle at this tournament compared to other

329
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,660
tournaments you've either been to or heard about, seen videos of? I think that not everyone

330
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,740
was really taking the tourney seriously, however, it looked like people were having fun with

331
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,820
what they were doing and that always to me, one of the biggest things that I like to judge

332
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,020
on is energy, the amount of enthusiasm you put into doing your performance and I have

333
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,880
to say there was a good bit of energy in the performances.

334
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,060
That's what happens when everyone drinks like four pitchers of beer right before.

335
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,460
We have the other contest that was going on on the side and that's the drinking contest

336
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,500
between Step Squad and the members of RTF that were there.

337
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,420
I know that Mr. Wendell drank a lot because he fell over halfway through his group comedy

338
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,600
performance for Cowgirl and that was pretty funny.

339
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,380
We have the drinking results in 7th place.

340
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,880
We have Iguana Girl of Step Squad, 6th place Islander, 5th place Fuzzy Hat, 4th place Mr.

341
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,320
Wendell, 3rd Rain of RTF, 2nd place Kiyoki, and 1st place J-Connect of Step Squad.

342
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:12,320
I'd also like to give a shout out to the newer members of Step Squad and to my Step Squad

343
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
family.

344
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,280
Really, it was Step Squad all over the place at the tourney and it was a lot of fun.

345
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,160
How many beers did Jake and Edick have?

346
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,000
Because I know Rain had about nine.

347
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,800
All I have to say also is, wait until we get to the interviews, you're going to see just

348
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,440
how Step Squad was all over this tourney, especially in the interviews.

349
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,880
So I know that there were many, many pitchers of beer floating around.

350
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,400
I do also know that apparently I'm some alcohol connoisseur because I sniffed it and could

351
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,040
tell it was Heineken.

352
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,840
There was a whole lot of drinking going on.

353
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,520
I was worried for a few people and Kiyoki turned into the human billboard for the tournament.

354
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I think I signed his head somewhere and Cory signed his arm with 2DX style.

355
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,920
I'll go ahead and give a plug for 2DXstyle.net, check it out.

356
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,320
They have a plug for us too.

357
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Yes.

358
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Very cool site.

359
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,940
It was basically, there was the impromptu wrestling out in the parking lot.

360
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,880
We had Jay Kinetic putting Keshi in the walls of Jericho while I had to do a run-in with

361
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,500
the orange bat of justice, trademark.

362
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,580
The bat did get signed by just about everybody, so it's now owned.

363
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,980
Okay, let's go to the tape.

364
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
How's that sound?

365
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Sounds like winter.

366
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,000
All right, I'm going to leave the mics hot and we can pause these interviews as we feel

367
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the need to interject.

368
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,620
Sam, this is a hot mic from my hand.

369
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,060
All right, here we go.

370
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,660
this is jamie live at the uh... dollar mendy tournaments which was held just

371
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,220
yesterday on august seventeenth rob if you don't want

372
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,140
no it's not like that started well we're gonna play it live though

373
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,740
yeah but it's a new line like a life tape

374
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,260
recorded it was a report that she was like

375
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,980
here we go here's the tape

376
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,140
hi this is that fact that i can see you live from mountain mike's income card

377
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,660
are you what i tell you she's coming to you live

378
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,860
august seventeenth of two thousand and two

379
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,460
This is a series of interviews done here at the Dollar Mandy Summer Vacation Tournament

380
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,580
for Orange Challenge Radio.

381
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,300
And if you don't like it, too bad.

382
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,020
So now we are to our next segment of interviews for Orange Challenge Radio now, but I don't

383
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,260
have the pause button on the recorder, so let's go to...

384
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
It was...

385
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,380
No, I have to say it was Jamie's first time, so you know, there was bound to be a few mistakes

386
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,780
and one of them was the pause button, but that's okay.

387
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,500
I love that though, because one of the interviews I did, I started off with Naoki Iijoji, who...

388
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,080
Apparently, we had been trying to meet for the Sakura Batsuri in San Francisco for years

389
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,420
and years in a row, and we finally met up at Turning, so it was cool.

390
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
Oh, that's cool.

391
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Well, good for you guys.

392
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,700
But, by the way, this is the very first...we're going to do this more and more on Orange Lounge,

393
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,100
go out throughout the Bomani community and tape things at events, and this is kind of

394
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,100
the first in a series of those, so Jamie did an excellent job with this.

395
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
My applause to her.

396
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Well, let's listen to the rest.

397
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,100
To our current guests, go ahead and tell everyone who you are.

398
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Give me our mic, once again.

399
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
The Cockmaster.

400
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Yes, the Cockmaster.

401
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,100
And go ahead and let everyone know what you're doing for Trini, again.

402
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Staff, and Gumby has two inches of hot dick for you.

403
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Would you like to answer this?

404
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
There's something behind it.

405
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
No.

406
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
He said no.

407
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Okay.

408
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Yes.

409
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,660
who were hanging out in the party room, there was a TV feed from the main room with the

410
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,420
machine and there was a sign held up that says, two inches of hot dick for you. So that's

411
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,340
where that's from. Is there a point to two inches of hot dick? No, it was just a sign

412
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,820
held up in front of the camera. Okay, you crazy kids. Well. Exactly. So, I know I've

413
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,940
asked the question again because I'm a dork and had the pause button on, but. It's okay

414
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Hey, Jamie, we forgive you.

415
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Fight me.

416
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
Shut up.

417
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,940
So, um, you know, once again, who's looking to be the top server for a PA and what do

418
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
you think is going to happen for Freestyle?

419
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
Me, Dave.

420
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
No, you suck a cock.

421
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,300
Anyway, yeah, Jimmy, emphasis, I think he will do really well.

422
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
Hey, you're here.

423
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Hola.

424
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,380
Yes, Hugo just came in.

425
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Word.

426
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,580
Uh, yeah, I think emphasis will probably do really well for Perfect Attack and like I

427
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,000
I said before you don't know what's gonna happen for freestyle. There should be a good amount of routines like

428
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Yeah, DDR for God

429
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,020
He's gonna win DDR for God. How was the DDR for God routine? Oh

430
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
I don't know

431
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,980
Oh, well what a load of crap

432
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,860
Do you think we're gonna have any waste of time today the tournaments a waste of time itself

433
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,620
off.

434
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,820
And now you have it, that's it.

435
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,020
And here we have a very special interview guest for our Orange John's radio segment.

436
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,380
Go ahead and introduce yourself.

437
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Hi, I am the oh-so-annoyed-and-loving-life-I-want-a-girl.

438
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Oh, we love you anyway.

439
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:30,220
Well, um, so what brings you here to Tourney, are you competing or watching or just laughing

440
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
at everyone?

441
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
I'm mostly just laughing at everyone.

442
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Who do you think is going to come out for a PA?

443
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm thinking it's probably going to come down to emphasis,

444
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,220
probably emphasis Okie and Virtu.

445
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,220
And what do you think is going to happen for a freestyle?

446
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
I really have no idea.

447
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I think, somehow I think Wendell is going to come out of it as one of the top

448
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,220
just because Wendell has this insane ability to always come out ahead.

449
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,220
So overall, are you having a good time returning?

450
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,800
So far I haven't had too much time to

451
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,260
socialize, but I'm expecting to have a fun time.

452
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,020
Had she had any drinks by this point?

453
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,180
Not at that point. They ordered a pitcher of beer soon after.

454
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,380
It was very yummy. Salad bars for like $3.99 rock.

455
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,700
Alrighty, well thank you very much. Well then y'all are gonna have fun in Vegas

456
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,100
because they got 99-cent salad bars there.

457
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,900
and lots of alcohol.

458
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,700
Oh, speaking of which, Jamie won't be with us next week, unfortunately,

459
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,200
because she's, well, fortunate for her, because she's going to Vegas,

460
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,700
but I'm fortunate for the rest of the stuff at home.

461
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I'm going to have me a warp core breach and ride the Star Trek experience.

462
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,100
It's just going to be, I'm telling you, that's the way to do it.

463
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
That's the way to do the Star Trek experience.

464
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm going to have a drunken nerd night.

465
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,000
You're very welcome.

466
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,900
I like my microphone.

467
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You seem to like that phallic symbol.

468
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,500
Guess what? I'm being a microphone whore again.

469
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,500
We have yet another person to interview, so go ahead and state your name for the audience.

470
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
And you're done chewing.

471
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Can't chew, otherwise known as Kiyoki of the Step Squad.

472
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Okay. And what are you here doing, a tourney?

473
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Actually, no, I wish I was, but me and Jay, we're both on the inactive list because of injuries or what other reasons,

474
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
so we're both SSA and security today.

475
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Ah, cool. So what do you think of Perfect Attack so far, and who do you think will come ahead?

476
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
We're having language filters, right?

477
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Our show is rated for adult content, so go ahead.

478
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.

479
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
I don't give a flying fuck till the freestyle starts.

480
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
And what do you think is going to happen for freestyle?

481
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,500
As long as there is no nasty guy stripping, I'm all for it.

482
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
We did have Gumby's Boxers.

483
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Like I said, I was unable to make the tournament, and I apologize for that.

484
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I did see ass later on that afternoon, although I don't remember who it was.

485
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Oh my.

486
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah, there was a cop right across the room.

487
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
You didn't even know who it was?

488
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I didn't see he was locking on.

489
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Was it a dark room?

490
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
It was a nice butt, though.

491
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Well, well, well.

492
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
I really hope for that since I'm judging. Oh my God.

493
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I personally think that everybody performing for Step Squad is just going to kick ass.

494
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
You know, that's me.

495
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Oh, hell yeah. Step Squad will kick ass.

496
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
So, um, overall, you know, you having a good time?

497
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Yes, yes I am.

498
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,580
If only Hugo and Meg could finally figure out how much of what they own of me, it'd

499
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
be all nice.

500
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,660
So there's no scale yet?

501
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Well, apparently, Hugo owns my soul, Meg just owns my body.

502
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,460
That works for me.

503
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,260
It works perfectly fine with me that way.

504
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,940
All right, well, we'll leave it at that.

505
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
Thank you.

506
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Thank you.

507
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,140
So this is the first of Supra interview number one.

508
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Yay.

509
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,580
I am sitting here.

510
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,260
Go ahead and state your name for the lovely listeners.

511
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Roberto.

512
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Radical.

513
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Cool.

514
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,580
And so our... you're here...

515
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,780
Does that mean, like, his first name is Ver2 and his last name is Radical?

516
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,900
No, I can receive Radical, too.

517
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,300
Oh, okay. Oh, you did them both at once.

518
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,660
Sorta. It was mostly Corey, but...

519
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,580
Oh, okay. Cool, cool.

520
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,380
I didn't hear Bratical. I heard Radical.

521
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,820
Like, that was his last name.

522
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,100
Like, the Radical Ver2!

523
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,700
The 80s are making a comeback, you know.

524
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,220
So what are you doing for the tourney today?

525
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,060
I'm doing PA.

526
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,180
Anything else?

527
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,740
Um... PA?

528
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Cool, and how did you do?

529
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Okay, beat me by two.

530
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
But you qualified, right?

531
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Yeah.

532
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:31,740
Cool, so just give us a little bit of your Bimani history and what you might be well known for even though probably everybody already knows.

533
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:38,740
I started playing Bimani back in 99 with the good old BeatMania Complete Mix 1.

534
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Yeah, it's a very quick master up in this piece.

535
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,740
And then I played DDR, it was lame.

536
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,740
Then I got bored with BeatMania, then I went back to DDR, and I was like, wow, this is pretty cool.

537
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,740
And I took it like an ass for two years. Took it like an ass, in the ass, however you want to put it.

538
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:05,740
And then, here I am now. Big name that I don't want to be. Yeah, he's taking my place.

539
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Do you care to comment on that?

540
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
About what?

541
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
About taking his place.

542
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
I feel honored.

543
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Who do you think is going to come out ahead for Freestyle today?

544
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Come out ahead? Call me stupid for saying this.

545
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Probably one of the RTF peeps. If Tran comes, he's pretty strong and everything.

546
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Mel maybe. I don't know. I'll see what RTF has in store.

547
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,740
If anyone from Ass comes, they got it in the pocket too.

548
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,260
I don't know, I might pull something out of my ass and make an ass of myself like I do

549
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
all the time.

550
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Corey, yes, please.

551
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,180
Oh, there's that comedy section too.

552
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,380
Yeah, that's right.

553
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,980
I might pull out another burning key.

554
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,560
Wow, Brad just got blammed.

555
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
That's pretty harsh.

556
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,420
Can somebody explain to me what a blam is?

557
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,740
It beats the heck out of me.

558
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Okay.

559
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,960
I'm hearing some interesting noises coming from the side that I'm not going to comment

560
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
on.

561
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,880
So, do you have any final words that you want to say for our listeners?

562
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,280
I'm not that special, quit making me something special, I play a game, I pass a song, whoop-de-doo.

563
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
And there you have it.

564
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Oh my God, it was first time out!

565
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,260
So, you have now yet another interview, so go ahead and state your name for our beautiful

566
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,760
and talented listeners.

567
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
My name is Mr. Wendell.

568
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
I am part of the staff.

569
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,560
How many beers by this point?

570
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,080
I don't think any yet.

571
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,400
You've got to be kidding me.

572
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,880
He was outside guarding the people who had to be hid away for PA.

573
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,440
That's the reason he could keep up that act the whole time is because he had influence.

574
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,080
If he had been drinking a lot later, and he can really chug fast, I saw.

575
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,160
Wendell is the beer master.

576
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Was he like that beer guy on the man show?

577
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,160
He's not quite like the fox, but he's pretty fast.

578
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Alrighty then, let's hear what else Wendell has to say here.

579
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,160
For the Dollar Mandy summer vacation.

580
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,160
That reminds me, did Dollar Mandy ever make an appearance?

581
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Because he was supposedly in town.

582
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
No, he didn't.

583
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
What a bummer.

584
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Just staffing today and not competing, or are you competing?

585
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm also competing.

586
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
And you're doing what say?

587
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I am doing single freestyle, and comedy.

588
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Ah.

589
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,160
So, what do you think is going to happen so far for Trudy today?

590
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Who do you see coming ahead for a perfect attack?

591
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,160
and who do you think is going to be your fierce competition for freestyle?

592
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Well, there's a lot of really good double freestylers that, well, double PAers, I should say.

593
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,160
I mean, right now I have in my jail this little twerk by the name of Emphasis.

594
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,160
You know, he kind of like beat me during the Royal Rumble, and I had to like give him a pile driver, you know.

595
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,160
I had witnesses for that, but he's a really good kid.

596
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
He can do doubles pretty good.

597
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,160
There's another little kid by the name of Minetki-Nek, a jazz.

598
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,160
He's kind of like tall. He's red-headed.

599
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,160
He looks like a monster, but he's like a teddy bear.

600
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:44,160
And we also have that wacky little guy by the name of Okie, Okimoto.

601
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Yeah, that boy is good.

602
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Who do you think is going to be your composition in freestyle?

603
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Well there's a lot of really good competitors. I see a lot of really good free-stylers.

604
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:06,160
You have like that Hypnotics dude. He's got that Darren's groove thing going.

605
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:20,160
I also see that Fuzzy guy, Fuzzy Torso, or whatever he's got Fuzzy on him.

606
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
I don't know, you know, that's not my thing.

607
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:31,160
We also have the crazy, wacky players, and yeah, they're going to be really, really good.

608
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,720
good. There's so many right there that are really, really good and I can't say that I

609
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,520
have much competition for them, but I'll do my best.

610
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,120
I think you'll do a good job besides that Step Squad owns.

611
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Well, well, well, we represent, Step Squad is a good organization. It's really all about

612
00:39:51,120 --> 00:40:02,080
all about family. We do our best to promote peace in the community. We go out there and

613
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,380
promote the freestyle, make sure that nobody does them hand slaps, do them D-drops, bump

614
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:13,540
their head on the floor like I used to do back in the day. We try to have fun and make

615
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,620
it an entertaining scene when we do tournaments and just have fun.

616
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
So you're having a good time so far?

617
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,620
I'm having a very awesome, entertaining time right now.

618
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,620
Even though I'm kind of like running staff and running this little jail right here, you know.

619
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,620
I have my big old fan, you know, guys try to escape.

620
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,620
I have the Wilson butt, but, you know, I'm having a wonderful time

621
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,620
and I expect to have a lot more fun times when the freestyle starts.

622
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
All right, well thank you very much.

623
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
The pleasure is all mine.

624
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
Okay, more interviews, yay.

625
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,620
So go ahead and state your name for our beautiful listeners.

626
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Ben.

627
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Hi.

628
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
What's Ben's online name?

629
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
I couldn't remember right now.

630
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
It sounded like Chub's, was it Chub's?

631
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
Yeah it was.

632
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
For a moment my brain was totally flipping.

633
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
That's what I thought.

634
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
I heard this before the show and it was never made clear so I thought we'd state that.

635
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
What are you doing here at the tournament today?

636
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:15,620
I'm competing in Perfect Attack and I'm part of the staff, moving machines, kicking people out and stuff.

637
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,620
Sounds like grueling work.

638
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
It's free pizza.

639
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
That's always a good reason.

640
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,620
So what do you foresee happening for a perfect attack today?

641
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Who do you think is going to come ahead?

642
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I think Okie will sweep.

643
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
That's what you're talking about.

644
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
Okie is going to win first.

645
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
Corey is going to fail.

646
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
I see.

647
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,620
And what do you see happening for a freestyle later today?

648
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:54,620
I haven't really looked over the list, but I'm pretty sure Fuzzy Hat will come up as some improv, Hypnotics might win, and Kyle Snyder will entertain himself.

649
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
But Kyle Snyder never shows.

650
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,620
Indeed.

651
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,620
So just to go ahead and give everyone a little bit of history, what's your history in the Bemani scene?

652
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:08,620
Well, I've been playing at the boardwalk three years ago, two and a half.

653
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,620
My first big tournament was March Madness, which is about six months ago.

654
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,620
Until then, I've been at every tournament, pretty much, since March Madness.

655
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
All right, well, thank you for the interview.

656
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
No problem.

657
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
More interviews, yay.

658
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,620
Yay.

659
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,620
I got another person to interview, so go ahead and for our listeners,

660
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,620
state your name and your brief history in the Milwaukee community.

661
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
What's your favorite color?

662
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,620
My brief history and a big money community.

663
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,620
It's a community?

664
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
More like a commune.

665
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Yeah, a communist party.

666
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,620
Let's see.

667
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,620
I'll tell you what it's more like.

668
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,620
You ever hear about Waco?

669
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,620
It's a big inbred party.

670
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Somebody got a bus.

671
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Let's see.

672
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:15,620
I have a brother named STI, one of the three original founders of StepSquad, other than me, Jay Kinetic, and Strider Vegeta, aka Strizzy.

673
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Let's see, I've entered too many tournaments to count and just now I've actually taken

674
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:32,380
it seriously on freestyling, so instead of just half-assing everything I might as well

675
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,380
do a routine, so last time I got a routine but I failed the song, oh well, giving another

676
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,180
shot again, so that's why I'm here.

677
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,700
What do you think of your competition for freestyle today?

678
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,900
The dudes from ass is like really good and I think there's like two other people that

679
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,420
are doing the same song I am.

680
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,500
I've been practicing it today but I've been moving alright.

681
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,980
I don't know man.

682
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,780
Wendell is cool.

683
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:11,740
I don't consider them competition, so I don't care how high I place or whatever, and I don't

684
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:16,180
even care about placing, I'm just trying to have fun, do what I'm supposed to do, and

685
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,380
entertain people.

686
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,340
That sounds like a really good philosophy to have.

687
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,500
I've noticed that some people get really, really heavy on the competition, on the have

688
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,500
to be better aspect.

689
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,100
I mean, what do you think of that kind of attitude?

690
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,860
Yeah, it's like, I had this mentality, it's like, oh man, I have to place top five and

691
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,380
I never end up doing it. So it's just like, you know, forget it. I'm just going to do

692
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:48,700
what I want to do, just dance and just entertain people, just show off some dance moves, whatever.

693
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,500
I don't know. I'm just going to go do my thing. I don't care if people don't like it or whatever.

694
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,900
As long as I have fun out there and I feel okay.

695
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,660
Do you have a final word for the listeners?

696
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,660
Yeah.

697
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Word.

698
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,660
Indeed.

699
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Thank you.

700
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,660
All right.

701
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:12,540
That's it for the first round of interviews there from Dollar Mindy's summer vacation.

702
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,940
And it was quite fun.

703
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,940
Yes.

704
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,940
What did you think of that?

705
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,140
Good group of people to interview there.

706
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,180
They're all very good about it.

707
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,620
I want to thank you all for putting up with me, shoving a microphone up your nose or anything.

708
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,740
No complete drunks yet, but...

709
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,700
Not yet, but we get them later.

710
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,580
But we do have more sets of interviews coming a little later in the show.

711
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,300
There's a great interview with Jahi in the second set of interviews.

712
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,620
Oh, that was fun.

713
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,900
And in the last set of interviews, you've got Dark Sound.

714
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,260
You're interviewing him, the master of the tournament, and the reason why the webcast

715
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,140
on DDR4E didn't end up happening.

716
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,740
So for those of you that were curious about what happened there, he gives the explanation.

717
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
It's all there.

718
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,140
We're going to play that for you a little later in the show.

719
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,540
In the meantime, if you weren't listening to the show a little bit earlier, we played

720
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,620
for you Memories, the new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song, and that was given to me

721
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:08,420
from our chatroom comedian Pyroman, and I promised him since I played that that I would

722
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,420
play Destiny.

723
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,840
So I will play Destiny.

724
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:16,140
Right after Destiny, we've got two brand new 8th Style songs we're going to premiere for

725
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,220
you right here.

726
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,620
Vir2 from 2DX Style, big thank you to him.

727
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:26,380
Go ahead and visit 2dxstyle.net for all the latest and greatest 2DX news, if you haven't

728
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
already.

729
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,800
And we're going to hear some new stuff from 8th Style thanks to those guys there.

730
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,460
So let's first hear Destiny and then we'll get to the 8th Style stuff here on Orange

731
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
Lounge Radio.

732
00:46:36,460 --> 00:47:01,680
go.

733
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,180
I'm just a kind of person

734
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,680
And I'm not a part of no other thing

735
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,680
And I'm not lying to no one

736
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,680
And I'm not a thing

737
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,680
I'm not a thing

738
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,680
That's the way I dream and dream

739
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,680
I know I just can't just take you free

740
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:35,680
I used to keep on following you, never letting you go

741
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,680
Following you all day, all night, I'm calling on you

742
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Never letting you go, I'm following you

743
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,680
You, you were the destiny

744
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,680
I was getting what we had to do

745
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:19,860
All right, as promised, here we go with some new eighth style tracks.

746
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,820
This first one is DJ Taka with M.

747
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,520
And by the way, this is the first time I will have even

748
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,320
heard these.

749
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,640
Any of us in the room will have heard these live here on

750
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,600
Orange Lounge Radio.

751
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,040
From 8th Style, DJ Taka with M.

752
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Oh

753
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:23,720
From 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was DJ Taco with M. Big thanks to the

754
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,960
folks at 2dxstyle.net and 2dxstyle.com. They both work now. And they've been yelling at

755
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,660
because I haven't been saying.com. I guess that's how they're going to promote it now,

756
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,920
although it was.net, but whatever. Anyway, we were thinking, it sounds a lot like V,

757
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:45,160
doesn't it, that song? That song is ass, okay? That was crap. What the hell is he doing?

758
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,120
I'm going to take a classical piano piece and add a beat to it. Oh, gee, why don't you

759
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,600
just throw in Polteri into there, too? That'd be even better. That would make it suck. Chat

760
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,960
Room is racking their brains trying to figure out what original piece that's based off of.

761
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,800
Bradley thinks he has it figured out, why don't you tell him?

762
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,160
It's from Moonlight Sonata by Bach.

763
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,200
Moonlight Sonata by Bach is what we believe that to be based off of, so

764
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,440
we'll have to go download the original and see if we can match it up, see if it works out.

765
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,720
Although that would make sense, M for Moonlight Sonata, but maybe M is for

766
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,640
Mozart Suggested Chat Room, so who knows?

767
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,320
Anyway, we're gonna...

768
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,920
V was for Vivaldi, so that would make sense.

769
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,600
So, who knows?

770
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:32,600
We'll play this next track for you from 8th Style Preview, DJW with Gemini.

771
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Oh

772
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:25,500
That's DJW with Gemini, and we do believe the category for that will be

773
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,420
the elevator music dot that was awful i'm sorry that mom is it

774
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,860
makes you want to take a nap or go shopping or something i i don't like it

775
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,380
that's just my opinion your knowledge on satellite preferred and much more to that

776
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,340
uh... i i disagree with low-key i'd kind of dug him it was cool i like that whole

777
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,580
classical remake thing but

778
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,140
they he doesn't need to kind of reinvented it's kind of been done we've

779
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,380
had the we've had a cochran

780
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,400
it's time okay

781
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,580
and better be the last one it needs to go in a different direction

782
00:53:54,580 --> 00:54:02,580
Well, it's not that I don't like that genre of music. I mean, piano ambient is awesome, but it's just he didn't do anything with it. He just added a beat to it.

783
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:08,580
I mean, do a little bit more than just add a beat to the music, because it's really old. That's all.

784
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,580
Quite.

785
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:20,580
Well, I'm kind of wanting things to go back to sort of old school, how the songs used to be in Beatmania. I want 5-key style stuff, you know.

786
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:26,260
Well, really, the other tracks that we've heard recently, to me they sound like a lot

787
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,260
of the Five Key stuff.

788
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,080
I think 8th Style is going to be a very Five Key kind of game.

789
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,580
That's kind of what it's sounding like to me.

790
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,300
Well, I mean, obviously it's not a Five Key game, but with that same style of music, especially

791
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,860
with a lot of the artists coming over from the Five Key series, since Five Key isn't

792
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,860
going to exist anymore.

793
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,860
I miss Five Key.

794
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
I miss it already.

795
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:50,040
Anyway, I'm going to play one more song for you, just because I've got to pee soon here.

796
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:58,300
We're going to play something else from Euromix 2 that's one of the supposed max 3 new songs.

797
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,760
This is Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band here on Orange Lounge Radio

798
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:16,240
I'm going to go my way, get with me your mother, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, break the dollar,

799
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:25,240
get out of here, come with me now, now we are going our way, I wanna show you baby,

800
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
The world you've never seen

00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Nothing can stop us now

802
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,240
So hold on tight, babe

803
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,240
So I will out there

804

When you come, open your eyes

805
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
Don't need to be afraid

806
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,240
Stay with me, baby

807
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
You are the one

808
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,240
To keep me sane

809
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Baby, take my hand

810
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,240
And love me now

811
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
I don't wanna know

812
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:01,240
But they say, no, no, I don't care They can't tell me nothing, I'm gonna go my way

813
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,240
One, two, three, four, five, race it, darlin', get out of here

818
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:56,880
From the steps-wide to orange paths, this GDR sucks, holler, stop, stop, stop, stop,

819
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:05,840
we want our slimmers, exercise, PS, all right, TTPO.

820
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,960
our thoughts on the uh... mister brian in the final band with crash from your

821
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,260
own it's not fucking sucked that was the biggest bit of aspects of the guitar

822
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:14,920
school

823
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,560
through the japanese singer and throw in a kindergartener it sounds like an old

824
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,640
man seen crappy lyrics

825
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,120
or any town lyrics by no missus kimball's

826
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,800
kindergarten class sung by

827
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,920
this stupid guy that's really what it is just crap let's take a crappy song and

828
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,600
add a crappy guy to it and will get some more crap

829
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,640
while they just made another uh... i know that he could sing firefly to

830
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,800
or and you know why not think died

831
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,920
i'm sure his voice it's not awesome on dot

832
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,560
for true you know he'd be good for true

833
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,720
according to the chat room it's white guys try to do break down in english

834
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,000
so anyway um...

835
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,440
while that was really bad so um...

836
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,120
on behalf of orange lounge radio

837
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,000
on behalf of

838
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,160
the lovely dark sacra co-host

839
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,220
On behalf of myself, Sky, co-host, I would like to offer an apology for wasting one minute

840
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,940
and forty-four seconds of your life with that utter piece of crap song that is known as

841
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,340
Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

842
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,940
Will you please ever forgive us for that?

843
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,980
Send us money if you do.

844
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,060
Money can be sent to, you know, Jamie Summerscare over.

845
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:31,220
Do I smell, yeah, DDR Max USA exclusive track-

846
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Oh wait, now it wouldn't be exclusive. New original for DDR Max USA though. I can just see it right now. It smells like the festering pile of shit that DDR Max USA will probably become.

847
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
Maybe not.

848
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:49,220
No, maybe not. Let's give it a chance. Let's at least see the song list before we bash it because right now it sounded pretty darn good.

849
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,220
Yeah.

850
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,220
We just gotta see the song list and then we can, you know, be as critical as all hell.

851
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,220
Breakdown.

852
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,620
Um, damn it, there was something else I wanted to play here, but I forget what it was.

853
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,300
My, my, I got all back-ass-ward here.

854
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,740
What do we want to talk about next? I want to do my Fuck You of the Week. Oh yeah, that's what we want to do.

855
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,140
We want to do the Fuck You of the Week. Let's, uh, get to Jamie's

856
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,420
Fuck You of the Week. For those that are new to the show, Jamie likes every week, and I

857
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,820
sometimes do too, and I do have a Fuck You this week, by the way.

858
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,740
But Jamie likes, and so does Matt, uh, Jamie likes to

859
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:25,340
get all pissed off at something every week, and we call it Jamie's Fuck You of

860
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:30,720
the week segment she's in ornery she's not always the sweet innocent moderator

861
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:44,020
that you might think she is okay so let's get to Jamie's f you of the week

862
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:50,020
Okay, my Fuck You of the Week goes to...

863
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,020
I forgot where my Fuck You of the Week is going to be.

864
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,020
Oh, yes! Fucking fantasy!

865
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,020
In, like, seven of all things.

866
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:06,020
Okay, I've been, you know, Iguana Girl has been very nice to let me, you know, trade out my fifth style with her to play fourth style,

867
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,020
so I've been, I said, I'm gonna, you know, finally beat fantasy and pass that back,

868
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:19,620
because, you know, I haven't been playing 2DX that long, and I've always been slow with, you know, picking up some of the stuff from the Ronnie games,

869
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,020
although, once I learn something, I really don't forget it.

870
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:33,320
Um, so I've been struggling with fantasy, and I've been getting 72, 76, 78, 78, 78, 78, every damn time I play the song,

871
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:38,720
so I want my fucking border bonus, and it's about goddamn time that I get it, and then I can give it back.

872
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:55,720
Although on a good note, I did finally pass a check or two, and I am probably about a couple weeks away from having my first 7-star beaten to the voltage or Y31.

873
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,120
having any pepsi blue in stock today

874
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,040
assistant

875
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,400
it's it's a good dessert drink for me just let me have my fun

876
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,640
it's good shit

877
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,480
someone eight of them two strawberries and cotton candy and puked it into a jar

878
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,760
well regardless

879
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,560
walgreens did not carry the puke in the jar that i happen to like so big fuck

880
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,960

881
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,220

882
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,460

884
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,560
i had to give you a song i'm sorry

885
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,160
i hate this song

886
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,300
my a few of the week goes to the conquered city planners

887
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,120
what the hell were you thinking with the streets

888
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:51,120
streets are supposed to have perpendicular intersections okay this crap of winding

889
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,200
streets that you have in there is just

890
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,400
unnecessary i got lost about four times in conquered and it should have been really simple

891
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,880
how did i add that was on the same road

892
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,120
yes it was on the same damn roads

893
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,540
i feel like it was stratton or something like that

894
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,560
it was just pathetic

895
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:16,560
It's pathetic. This road makes three different turns and they have streets intersecting with it. It's crap. So, my F.U. goes out to them.

896
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,560
It's raining. Hallelujah.

897
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,560
Our chat room has some F.U.s of the week they want to dish out, so let me get to those.

898
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:30,560
SoCalKick says, F.U. GenomScream for not going to Power Station and F.U. DJ Ness for leaving early.

899
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:38,560
And fuck you Pepsi Blue for making me sick and having a crappy cap that's spilled on the cam I borrowed and it spilled on it and fucked the cam up, whatever that means.

900
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Pyro Man, our local chatroom comedian, would like to give a big fuck you to the live 365 lady that comes up whenever he tries to start the stream and it ends up delaying his stream by two minutes.

901
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,560
So, a big F you by them.

902
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,560
And that's our Fuck You of the Week. Good job, everybody.

903
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,760
I feel the leak goes toward Propel, put out by Gatorade.

904
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:04,480
This beautiful fitness water tastes like Ghetto Kool-Aid and owns you for free.

905
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,120
Let's get to the second part of the Daler-Mendy interview, shall we?

906
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
We shall.

907
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
We shall.

908
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Here we go.

909
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,520
More of Jamie live doing interviews at the Daler-Mendy tournament, which was just yesterday.

910
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,680
Yes, it was.

911
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,960
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

912
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
All day.

913
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
I'm doing more interviews.

914
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:27,660
doing more interviews. Anyway, go ahead and state for our listeners your name and a little

915
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,580
bit of your history in the Badminton community.

916
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah, I'm Hattori Hanzo and I've been in the DDR community for about two years now. I remember

917
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,560
starting out when we had some valley mall out here in Concord on a USA mix machine and

918
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,900
everybody's fan favorite Orochi would come and play all the time and would just scare

919
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:55,780
everyone off the pad, which is okay. We finally figured out how to play and we decided to

920
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:04,660
go along with it. I met people like Wendell and Shadow Me Twice and Drakonas over at the

921
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:10,400
mall and we became good friends once we got a machine over here at Mountain Mikes. From

922
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,900
there it's just been a tournament, hanging out, having fun, just trying to do what we

923
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:25,820
do then lately I just joined step squad with the with Wendell and the dark

924
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,860
Takumi there yeah it's pretty much what's really going on right now so

925
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:38,620
that's about it so what's your plans for the attorney today well I'm judging

926
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:43,240
freestyle today because I don't play doubles so perfect attack is pretty dumb

927
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:50,360
for me right now, and I really can't freestyle, so I decided to just be a judge, and that'll

928
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,360
be it.

929
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:56,200
Who do you think is going to come out on top for our freestyle today?

930
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Freestyle?

931
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
I don't know.

932
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,960
There's some pretty good people out there.

933
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,400
I know there's Wendell, and he got Takumi coming up with something, and then we got

934
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Fuzzy.

935
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,480
He's got some good names out there, so I can't really tell.

936
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,480
Overall, what's your opinion of the Baymani community as it is right now?

937
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Well, lately it's becoming more and more, quote-unquote, scrubby-fied with all these newbies trying to act like they know what they're talking about without asking questions beforehand.

938
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:38,420
So I'm one of the quote unquote old school people and respect is still there but these

939
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:45,080
newbies coming up they need to either just sit there and watch what's going on or ask

940
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,840
sensible questions because this immaturity is just not working.

941
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:55,240
So do you have any final thoughts or words that you want to leave with the listeners?

942
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:02,340
All I got to say is, Step Squad for life works.

943
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,980
And I'm going to go ahead and add my personal note that I totally 100% agree because Step

944
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,980
Squad owns.

945
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,980
Thank you.

946
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:08,980
You're welcome.

947
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,580
And we have more interview fun.

948
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,580
Yay!

949
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,520
So go ahead and for our listeners, go ahead and state your name and your history with

950
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,620
the Bemani community.

951
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,620
Let's see.

952
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:23,220
I'm ShadowMeTwice and I like playing DDR.

953
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:31,340
I've been playing DDR for like two years, and yeah.

954
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,620
That sounds absolutely awesome.

955
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,700
So what is your participation with the tournament today?

956
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,860
Are you competing or moral support or immoral support?

957
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,060
Well, I guess I'm just here for moral support, hanging out.

958
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,460
And if Dark Sound lets me, I might

959
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,020
do my little old school routine from back in the day.

960
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,020
Otherwise, I'm just going to stand and hang out and yeah.

961
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,140
That sounds pretty groovy.

962
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,660
So what do you think of the competition so far?

963
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,620
How do you think things are going?

964
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,180
Well, I don't know too much about PA,

965
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,780
but it looks pretty good.

966
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,500
I know I see some pretty good people here, like Virtu.

967
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,860
And I know Mananako Jazz is here.

968
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,340
So he's good stuff.

969
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,900
I'm waiting for that freestyle, though.

970
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,940
And I'm wondering if the webcam is working.

971
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,620
And I'll have to check on the cam.

972
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,620
But for last I heard, I think that everything

973
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,780
is supposed to be a go.

974
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,300
So do you have any final words for the Baymani community

975
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,860
or for our listeners or anything?

976
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:38,020
Yes, keep on playing the DDR and the Baymani.

977
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,620
Thank you.

978
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,040
Hi, go ahead and state your name and involvement

979
01:07:44,040 --> 01:08:10,040
What's your participation in the tournament today?

980
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:16,040
Well, I just got to the second round and I was first in qualifying.

981
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,040
That's for Perfect Attack?

982
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
Yes.

983
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Are you doing a freestyle at all?

984
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,040
No.

985
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,040
So who do you think is your strongest competition in Perfect Attack?

986
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Basically Okie because his scores in doubles only are insane.

987
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,040
Okay.

988
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,040
So what's your view of the Bimani community as it is today?

989
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,040
It's getting worse.

990
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,040
Like in what way?

991
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:46,040
More, it's just too much, as you say, drama.

992
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Drama sucks.

993
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:53,040
So, do you have any final words for the listeners?

994
01:08:53,040 --> 01:09:00,040
Freestyle takes creativity, PA takes nothing. That's why I PA.

995
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,040
Thank you.

996
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,040
What's with all this hate for PA today?

997
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,040
It's really boring.

998
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,040
It was long.

999
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,360
Yeah, very long, like six hours.

1000
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,520
It's about as exciting as golf is.

1001
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,680
There will be a tournament one day with exciting PA.

1002
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,680
I guarantee it.

1003
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,160
I'm telling you, when they start doing the trivia questions mixed in with PA and start

1004
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,820
beating people with bats when they get questions wrong, that will be the day.

1005
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:28,760
It is something I would like to do for the next PA if we do a tournament here in Sacramento,

1006
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,440
which, by the way, we are trying to plan.

1007
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,200
We'll have details on that for you as soon as we get them.

1008
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Nice little distant plug there.

1009
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,020
And now back to the interviews.

1010
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,140
This is around 20 million for the interviews.

1011
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:44,740
Go ahead and state your name and your history in the Baymani community for listeners.

1012
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,100
I'm Paulo Sambrano.

1013
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:50,500
I go in the DDR community as Rock My Socks Off, and in the Poetry Slam community I'm

1014
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
known as the Freaky Funky Space Monkey.

1015
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,080
Isn't that a flavor of Ben and Jerry's?

1016
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,820
I have no idea, but this guy was cool.

1017
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:57,820
Alright, he sounds pretty cool.

1018
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,340
And I've been involved in the Baynominee scene for about two years, although I've been playing

1019
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,980
DDR for about a year and three months now.

1020
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:11,100
So are you here competing or in moral support observing?

1021
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:16,100
Actually it's really funny you bring that up because I'm doing a documentary about DDR

1022
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:22,540
in the Bay Area, no Calcine and let's see, I didn't pre-register, I don't have a tripod

1023
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:27,140
but I have a camera and the only way that Ruben or Dark Sound is going to let me get

1024
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,900
in the actual pit area where all the freestyle action is going to go down, so I actually

1025
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:35,580
register under freestyle, I suppose.

1026
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:40,700
So I'm probably just going to register under freestyle and own the waste of time bracket

1027
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,180
just for the hell of it.

1028
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:48,500
And who do you think is going to be your number one competition in the waste of time bracket?

1029
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,500
I don't know.

1030
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,740
All I know is I'm going to own it, let's just put it that way.

1031
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,740
How's that for an honest answer?

1032
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:00,440
So what's your view on the Baymani community so far, especially in regards to that documentary

1033
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,440
you're doing?

1034
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,360
It's hard to say actually, because from what I could observe in the SF scene, it was really

1035
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:11,800
going down, then it was going up, with the whole Rise of Riptide arcade as being hailed

1036
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:18,280
as the golf land of SF, but I would have to say there's a lot less, I'm not sure, from

1037
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,560
what I could tell, unity in the community for some right now, because there's a lot

1038
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,960
of like, I don't know, disenchantment, I suppose, and a lot of noobs getting in the community.

1039
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,840
I'm not saying that's a bad thing, because we were all noobs, but it's a lot of cocky

1040
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,720
noobs and a lot of cynicism from the old schoolers, so that's what my take on it.

1041
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:41,080
Would you have any advice for new players or just, you know, for the listeners in general?

1042
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,280
Any final words?

1043
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:50,800
Advice-wise, to put it this way, I'm still a noob, although, I don't know, different

1044
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:59,360
standards, but just keep doing it. Keep trying. Fuck what everyone else has to say. Just do

1045
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,600
it because you love it, not because everyone else is telling you to do it. People call

1046
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,440
you a noob or a lamer. Fuck it because we're all noobs and lammers. They're just small

1047
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:16,380
dicks so they just need some sort of instant gratification. And last words, yeah, my doc

1048
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:25,380
The box is going to be out later this year. Come see it. I'm going to sell it to PBS and become moderately famous. Thanks a lot.

1049
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:32,380
I like how he says he's not going to be famous. He's just going to be moderately famous, like a local celebrity.

1050
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:41,380
Moderately famous like the woman, the British woman that insults everyone. I forget what show it's called.

1051
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,380
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

1052
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,380
That one.

1053
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,380
He'll be more famous than that for a DDR documentary.

1054
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,380
It's moderately famous because I don't know her name.

1055
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:56,380
And something. Damn it, now it's going to kill me all day.

1056
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,380
My point exactly.

1057
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,380
Shit! Alright, back to the interviews.

1058
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,380
Thank you.

1059
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,380
And now we have more witty words of wisdom.

1060
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,380
I dance to heal the world.

1061
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:13,380
It's like a performance artist. I don't want to be brash, but I think I'm the dandy...

1062
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,380
What the fuck was that artist's name? We did the Campbell's soup cat.

1063
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,380
That was Andy Warhol.

1064
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,380
Andy Warhol of DDR.

1065
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,380
The Andy Warhol of DDR.

1066
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,380
You heard it first on Orange Lounge.

1067
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:27,380
I prefer the Marilyn Monroe painting myself.

1068
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,380
But hey, to each his own.

1069
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,380
Oh my god, whee!

1070
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,380
I mean...

1071
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:36,380
I'm doing yet another interview, so...

1072
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:41,380
If you don't mind, go ahead and give us your name and association

1073
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:48,380
Hi, I'm Megumi, also known as Sweet Megumi. I am part of Pet Squad for Step Squad.

1074
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,380
And what's your history in DDR?

1075
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:57,380
I play DDR and I go to tournaments and I work for tournaments and stuff. I don't usually enter them, but I'm there.

1076
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:03,380
I'm interrupting this to say I looked it up. It's Anne Robinson. Thank you, Anne Robinson.

1077
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:10,820
See everyone and always friendly. Yes, the girl in the pink. Yes. So, um, what do you think of the tourney today?

1078
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,140
It's pretty cool

1079
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:16,900
There's a lot of people that I haven't seen for quite a while and I like the way Ruben has to set up as like

1080
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
you know the green room type of thing so

1081
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,500
And who do you think is gonna come out on top for a PA or for a freestyle?

1082
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,780
Of course, I'd say Oakey because he's my favorite and freestyle. I don't know who entered so

1083
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,740
So, if AJ's here, he'll probably win it.

1084
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,740
If not, I don't know.

1085
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:41,300
So, do you have any final words for the listeners or for the community or any sage words of

1086
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,620
wisdom from observation?

1087
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,620
I don't know.

1088
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,820
Just play DDR.

1089
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,820
Indeed.

1090
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:50,820
How honest.

1091
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,820
And, by the way, Stas Quadons.

1092
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,820
Yes.

1093
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:56,820
We do.

1094
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,820
Anyway, thank you.

1095
01:14:58,820 --> 01:14:59,820
Thank you.

1096
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,820
No problem.

1097
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,820
Whee!

1098
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:06,340
And the newest in line of interviews for Orange Lounge Radio.

1099
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,700
Go ahead and tell everyone who you are and a little bit about your involvement in the

1100
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,700
community.

1101
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,700
What's up, yo?

1102
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,340
This is Jay Kinetic representing the SSF Step Squad family as well as the Step Squad Assassins

1103
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,340
and Pet Squad.

1104
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,900
I've been playing this game since some of you didn't even know 1.5 was back in MGL so

1105
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,900
I could be considered an OG.

1106
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:27,220
Basically Step Squad was formed in order to bring more of a family element to DDR.

1107
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:31,580
We wanted to be the alternative to most of the DDR3 communities out there that are biased

1108
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:35,900
against gender, race, sexual orientation, you name it.

1109
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:39,660
We have about 30, 35 players right now who are dedicated to the game as well as getting

1110
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:45,900
each other through tough times and just being there for each other like family, I guess.

1111
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,500
One thing that I need to comment is that the squeal of daddy in the background was Draconis'

1112
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:56,500
daughter, Lily, who is famous for, she's also known as Fuzzy Half, and is also famous for

1113
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,020
the quote, this DVR sucks. So, I just thought I'd mention that because you can hear.

1114
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:05,340
Alrighty. Are you sure nobody was tied up at the tournament or anything like that?

1115
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,660
There was no bondage going on at the tournament that I saw.

1116
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:08,660
What a shame.

1117
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:13,500
What a person at the Step Squad owned...anyway.

1118
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:18,500
So, as far as tourney goes, are you competing or working or, you know, how's your involvement

1119
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
with this tourney here?

1120
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,500
Today I'm out in my SSA uniform and providing security.

1121
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:28,500
We haven't had too many rowdy people, so I'm sitting here enjoying the Heineken courtesy of my friends Wendell and Si.

1122
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,500
What's up, Thieves Guild?

1123
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Normally I do compete in tournaments. I didn't have time to prepare a routine this time,

1124
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,500
but the next tournament I'm looking forward to is Scandio or the Disney's Rave tournament,

1125
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,500
or I might pull an improv, I don't know, as well as PA.

1126
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,500
So far for the PA or the freestylers in each category, who do you think is going to come out on top?

1127
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:51,500
I'm hoping that Jazz comes out on top of the PA'ers in this particular tournament.

1128
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,500
Freestyle is still unpredictable. I'm still not sure who's entered, so I'm going to try to keep a close eye on that.

1129
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
We're going to be hanging out here until about 9 o'clock.

1130
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:02,500
But it's always a good crop. We have some of the most skilled freestylers out here today.

1131
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,500
We've got Rain from RTF out here, Fuzzy Half from Step Squad, just newly inaugurated.

1132
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,500
He's here. Wendell's here. I'm not sure if he's competing.

1133
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
It's going to be a hot competition as normal.

1134
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,500
What's your view on the Baymani community currently and what kind of advice would you give?

1135
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,700
There are a lot of veteran players who give some of the new school players shit just to

1136
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,660
give them shit, and I don't feel that that's right.

1137
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:53,500
I feel that there are a lot of online communities such as ddrspot.com, ddrfreak.com, and Step

1138
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:58,420
Squad message board, plug ourselves in there, that provide a quasi-decent environment.

1139
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,740
I'd say Step Squad out of the three does, but then again we're kind of a gay community

1140
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:05,860
in that respect because we only let in people that we know or people that are part of the

1141
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:06,860
squad.

1142
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:11,200
Doesn't mean you can't visit, but the reason why we keep it that way is because it gives

1143
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,580
all the players involved a chance to grow rather than having to deal with the prejudice

1144
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,640
and stereotypes of the DDR community at large. This doesn't mean that the community at large

1145
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,600
is a negative thing. Jason Coe, alias J-Dog, you may know him from the DDR Freak Boys,

1146
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,480
has encouraged a very large, very skilled community. It just means that with that exposure

1147
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,000
that you get from interacting with that larger community, you may encounter more prejudice

1148
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,640
and more stereotypes, because for every one intelligent person there is, there's at least

1149
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,600
another nine who are like, oh, I am easy and I am weak because I can pass all nine katas,

1150
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,840
that sort of thing. So I feel that the community is growing and I hope to see it progress a

1151
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,580
little bit more in the United States, even though Konami of America can kiss my ass because

1152
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:55,400
they screwed us. But at the same time, I still think it's going to grow.

1153
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,640
I didn't get screwed.

1154
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,240
I didn't get screwed.

1155
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Why weren't we invited?

1156
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,760
I don't think people are going to be playing it in the States, and if not, hell, I'll go

1157
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,720
play Pump It Up. I don't care.

1158
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,720
So do you have any parting words for the listeners?

1159
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:17,720
Shoutouts to RTF, Gary, Shintenchi, NoSkills, pretty much everybody in there, Rain, there's

1160
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:24,720

Thank you.

1168
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,680
That's what I do, thanks for having me on Jamie.

1169
01:19:51,680 --> 01:20:00,440
Alright, so that was the second part of our Dalamendi interview brought to us by the lovely

1170
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,820
other half of the show Jamie who was able to go out to the tourney yesterday

1171

1172
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:14,300

1173
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,700
going to be getting out of town and I might be going to some of the hot Bay

1174
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:22,660
Area arcades and getting some random interviews around there so you never

1175
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,980

1176
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,220
recorder and I'm coming after you.

1177
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:32,340
Anyway, a big hello to all of our new listeners tonight listening in for our coverage of the

1178
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,340
Dollar Mandy tournament.

1179
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:38,860
If you want to join our chat room, just join Channel Orange Lounge on any other side IRC

1180
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,860
server.

1181
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,260
That's the server that hosts all the big Bimani channels like DDR Freak, 2DX Styles, all those

1182
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,260
big channels.

1183
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:48,340
We're on there too under Channel Orange Lounge.

1184
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,820
And I'm being given some results from SoCal Kicks.

1185
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,060
There was another tournament that happened over the weekend and that was the Power Station

1186
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,480
2 tournament.

1187
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:01,360
And in PA, the first place winner was Trunks, second was Frost, third was Lazy Pinoy, and

1188
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,360
fourth was...

1189
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,800
How do you pronounce it?

1190
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,960
I don't want to mess it up.

1191
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,960
You've seen this before.

1192
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,960
I haven't.

1193
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,500
Sinai Butterfly, is that how you say it?

1194
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,500
Thank you.

1195
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,520
Freestyle, first place, Kenny Wood with Santa Doing Doubles, and second place was Hungry

1196
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,520
Asian.

1197
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
He doesn't remember the song.

1198
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:25,760
And then Jenneth with Remember You, and then to Sunny Butterfly again with Let's Talk It

1199
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,760
Over.

1200
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,280
And there's pictures at 2dxstyle.com slash sck.

1201
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,360
And it was all held on a 5th Mix machine.

1202
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,360
Pretty good stuff.

1203
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:43,600
So, also I should plug the Monty Music and More program, which is always on this network

1204
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,000
when we're not here.

1205
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,920
the music from DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania series, and there's other random stuff in there too,

1206
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
Bust-A-Groove, Parappa.

1207
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,920
Because we are indeed random.

1208
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,680
We'll play whatever the hell we feel like playing, Bomani and more, on a dial-up print

1209
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,680
in the stream.

1210
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,680
Did you mention our chat room?

1211
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,440
Yeah, I did Channel Orange Lounge, on the other side of the seat.

1212
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,040
And one other thing, the Monday night rebroadcast, if you missed any part of the show, if you

1213
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,540
missed our first set of interviews, we had a lot of people in the first set of interviews,

1214
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:13,120
we do rebroadcast the show, we'll be rebroadcasting these shows on Monday nights, so tomorrow

1215
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:18,320
night on August 19th. Tune in at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the rebroadcast

1216
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,160

1217
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:27,520
o'clock and 11 o'clock. Because you're special enough to have it twice. Yes, you're going

1218
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,560
to get it twice and in the middle there, you're going to get it twice. In the middle of that

1219
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,800
big sandwich, we're going to rebroadcast an old show. We're going to be rebroadcasting

1220
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,360
episode number 6 and for those that don't know, that was the one when we had Mel B and

1221
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,540
melody visiting us and so we have some in-house interviews with them so I'll be

1222
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:48,740

1228
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:13,340
ago. That was fun. That guy was like, I'm not going to say anything because I'm nice

1229
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:18,820
and he was retarded. Send all your love and hate mail to orangeloungeradio.com. That's

1230
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,520
all one word, Orange Lounge Radio. You want to intro this next song for us, Jamie? This

1231
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,920
is the one you were searching around for. Let's just make it a surprise. Let's just

1232
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,260
make it a surprise. It is not the full version, but it's close enough. We're going to take

1233
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:36,100
a quick break, and when we come back, more interviews! We'll do the interviews at the

1234
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,880
the show. We're going to do listless. We're going to do a really quick listless segment

1235
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:46,020
with the...you want to enter this? Best DDR background. The best DDR background. Not necessarily

1236
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,100
the video, but images, anything associated with it. For some of our new listeners, want

1237
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:54,700
to tell them some of the results of our previous listless competitions. Well, we've had best

1238
01:23:54,700 --> 01:24:04,420
2DX song. Was absolute. Absolute. Best 2DX video was...Love is Dreaminess. And the worst

1239
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,640
bimani song in history next to let them move because let them move is already assumed the

1240
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,020
worst bimani song in history bye bye baby balloon bye bye baby balloon was determined

1241
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,180
that song will no longer ever be on our playlist that song is banned from our playlist we will

1242
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,860
never play it i'd like to add the future song that should be added to that list and that

1243
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:27,260
would be have to be crash that song is ass and i just hope it doesn't get worse than

1244
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:32,260
that the name contrary to popular belief is not after you know an accident although the

1245
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,700
The song itself is an accident.

1246
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,100
I'm sorry, what did you say, Matt?

1247
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,740
I'm gonna go out there when you look at both of your eyes.

1248
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,620
God, this is awful.

1249
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,700
OK, I won't waste a break.

1250
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,380
Break down, then crash.

1251
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,060
What's the next one?

1252
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,260
Stall.

1253
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,220
All right, I promise.

1254
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:46,720
No, no, no.

1255
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,260
I promise a break.

1256
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:50,300
Basically, the name is a combination of crap and ass.

1257
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,300
You crash.

1258
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,420

01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:17,020
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

1265
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:21,020
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

1266

Of a keeper

Oh, baby, don't you see me? It's all in vain. It's all because I'm dying if you need me.

1298
01:33:52,820 --> 01:34:00,820
Don't dare to say I'm called un trois. Once more, it's just another word.

1299
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:11,820
Oh, baby, don't hurt me. Don't cut your dent, cut someone. And if there's life worth living, don't break my heart.

There's nothing wrong

1311
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,320
I'm calling for

1312
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,320
Don't cut down

1313
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
I'll be the worst

1314
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
Oh, baby, don't you see me?

1315
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
I'm in this all in vain

1316
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,320
It's all because

1317
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,320
I'm dying if you leave me

1318
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,320
Don't dare to say

1319
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,320
I'm calling for

1320
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,320
This world is just another world

1321
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,320
Oh baby don't hurt me

1322
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,320
Don't come to damn

1323
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,320
Come as you are

1324
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,320
And make this life worth living

1325
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,320

01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,320
I need more truth

1328
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,320
I give in please

1329
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:30,320
Don't share me

1330
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
Don't come to damn

1331
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,320
I love you so deep down inside

1332
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:39,320
What if I'm not alive?

1333
01:35:39,320 --> 01:36:08,320
Don't cut down, love your words Oh baby, don't you see me

1334
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:15,320
If it's all in vain, it's all because I'm dying if you need me

1335
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:22,320
Don't dare to say I'm going wild This world is just another world

1336
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:27,320
Oh baby don't hurt me I won't go to death

1337
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,320
Can't let someone Can make this life worth living

1338
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:35,320
Don't break my heart Let me move my blur

1339
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:58,320
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1340
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,320
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1341
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,320
No!

1342
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
Do we care what people think of us?

1343
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
No!

1344
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,320
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1345
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
Yes!

1346
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:18,320
Extreme Bamani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1347
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,320
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1348
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:26,320
Tonight we've been doing some of the Dollar Mendy coverage from that big tournament in Concord yesterday.

1349
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,600
We're taking a break to do listless, one of our favorite segments here on the show.

1350
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,920
We're going to be talking about tonight the best DDR background, that little image that

1351
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,760
comes up when you start the song.

1352
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,040
It's an artsy moment for DDR, it's kind of showing off the graphics capability or whatever

1353
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,000
you want to call it, I don't know.

1354
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,960
We were kind of debating, there was a lot of debate in house about whether we were counting

1355
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:50,000
the videos or not, and we decided no, we're not going to count the videos, we're just

1356
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,200
going to talk about the actual backgrounds themselves, maybe we'll do DDR videos at a

1357
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,200
later date.

1358
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:01,240
what's going to happen you guys in the chat room are going to be able to vote

1359
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:05,560
we will we will give each our top three and then we're going to go through an

1360
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:09,720
elimination round where once we have that big list of 12 songs there's four

1361
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:14,720
of us participating we each get to take one off of the list and then those of

1362
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,320
you in the chat room will get to vote you're going to send me a private

1363
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:22,040
message in the chat room with your vote and that'll be the winner and then we'll

1364
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:28,760
We'll get back to the last set of Dollar Mandy interviews and that will be a show.

1365
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,880
So let's get down to it.

1366
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,480
List list, best DDR background.

1367
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:37,240
Jamie what did you put down for your number three choice?

1368
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,240
Paranoia.

1369
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,240
That guy's head is scary.

1370
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,820
And I mean old school paranoia.

1371
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:48,120
So the very, very first paranoia.

1372
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,440
Alright paranoia it is.

1373
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,440
Matt, let's hear yours.

1374
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:56,480
okay mine has to go for in the mood for dancing because you've got that chick

1375
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:01,120
leaning over and just it's got the cleavage shot there so that's it all

1376
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,720
right fair enough Dave let's hear your number three choice

1377
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,160
mine is abyss because it's got the two like yellow aliens or whatever they're

1378
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:13,160
in the blue background good choice abyss my number three choice is conga feeling

1379
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,680
because I like that chick it's very abstract art she's got what the hell is

1380
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:21,160
that coming out of her mouth I like that conga feeling background okay so

1381
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,160
Alright, let's hear the number two choices.

1382
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,160
Brilliant to you for the mecha thingy.

1383
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,160
The mecha dog.

1384
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,160
Brilliant to you for the mecha dog.

1385
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,160
You're being very old school tonight.

1386
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:35,160
What do you mean tonight? I'm old school every night.

1387
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,160
That's true, very true.

1388
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:39,160
Don't send me your votes just yet, Chad, when we don't have a list yet.

1389
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:43,160
You can't vote yet. We have to have a list and then you vote off the list.

1390
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:48,160
Alright, well this would be considered the most offensive background I could find in DDR.

1391
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,520
finding DVR. That would have to go to Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick with the guy in the fucking

1392
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:59,520
underwear with the pistol. That's just disturbing. Fair enough. Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.

1393
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:07,360
Okay, mine is Secret Rendezvous. Secret Rendezvous. Two chicks. Always good. You buy into that

1394
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,920
whole Secret Rendezvous is about a bunch of lesbians theory? Dude, they're rubbing up

1395
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,860
against each other. Alright, fair enough. My number two choice would be the Afrinova

1396
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:23,580
a background, but the OG one from Third Mix, not the newer one, the chick, the reptile

1397
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:24,580
thing.

1398
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,580
Screaming into the thing.

1399
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:27,580
No.

1400
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:33,820
We just, also, by the way, our listeners did not hear what Dave just said.

1401
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,820
Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

1402
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:39,660
I said, I thought the one with the reptile was the primeval.

1403
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,980
No.

1404
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,980
The primeval one's all blurred, it's just- The first one had the person screaming at

1405
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:44,980
the thing.

1406
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,980
You got it.

1407
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,980
A number one for me.

1408
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:52,980
I'm no longer going to be old school with this. I say burning heat just because it's burning heat.

1409
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,980
Fair enough. Burning heat.

1410
01:40:54,980 --> 01:41:00,980
Okay. I saw burning heat and about pooped my pants because I was having a Gradius II moment.

1411
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:01,980
Oh my God, I pooped my pants!

1412
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:04,980
Because I was having a Gradius II, you know, orgasmic moment.

1413
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,980
I saw the ninja?

1414
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,980
Uh, yeah.

1415
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,980
Anyway, Matt, your number one choice.

1416
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:15,980
My number one choice is back from third mix. It has to be a get up and dance with the DJing penguin.

1417
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:22,980
and

1418
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,420
uh... my number one also has

1419
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,740
two things in it

1420
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,780
so you got to remember one best d r background

1421
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:38,020
last one on the list of my number one choice

1422
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:42,060
was also on a please not so quick so

1423
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:45,220
it started a revolution what can you say

1424
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:49,420
unfortunately dramatic faces that was a duplicate we're gonna go ahead and let

1425
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:52,060
one more random one on the list we have bradley back in the corner i'm gonna

1426
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,280
put him on the spot

1427
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,780
you remember anything you don't know anything how in it

1428
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,380

message just in breakdown with the big blue froggy thing at a break and i

1434
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:10,980
break down

1435
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:13,020
was that part of the or that was not the background

1436
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,020
It was part of the video.

1437
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,020
I thought it was part of the background too.

1438
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,020
The background was...

1439
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:19,080
Oh, that's right, the chick with the shirt, the letters.

1440
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,080
Oh, well that's so pretty.

1441
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,240
Alright, we're going to go with B for you?

1442
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,240
Breakdown?

1443
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,240
We'll do breakdown.

1444
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:25,240
We'll do breakdown.

1445
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,240
Alright, breakdown it is.

1446
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,240
Yeah, I know.

1447
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:31,680
That'll get one vote if it doesn't get eliminated from the list which we're going to do right

1448
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
now.

1449
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,680
Here's our list.

1450
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:39,380
So far we have Paranoia, In The Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Conga Feeling, Brilliant To You, Oh

1451
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,880
Nick Please Not So Quick, Secret Rendezvous, Afro Nova, Third Mix,

1452
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,740
6, Burning Heat, Get Up and Dance, Sugaru, Breakdown. This is going to be a hard one

1453
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:51,440
to start eliminating from, but Jamie gets the first pick.

1454
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,440
Breakdown.

1455
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:57,960
I'm sorry, person who suggested it, but you know, t-shirts aren't that interesting.

1456
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright, Breakdown's off. Matt?

1457
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:07,200
Alright, I'm going to have to go with, let's see here, Sugaru, because it's just kind of

1458
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,200
boring.

1459
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,200
Oh, Sugaru.

1460
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,680
It looks like they're beating each other with telephone poles. Was it just me that thought

1461
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:16,680
That was like big telephone poles.

1462
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,680
Still got to have gone.

1463
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,680
Dave, your pick.

1464
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:23,680
Okay, um, I guess I'll have to take off Burning Heat, because, I mean...

1465
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,680
Oh!

1466
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,680
Well done!

1467
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,680
That's it.

1468
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:32,680
I mean, it's not that great of a picture.

1469
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:34,680
Alright, Burning Heat's gone.

1470
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
This is a hard one for me.

1471
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,680
It's not that good of a picture.

1472
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:45,240
I, I like, I like all these backgrounds. Um, there's only one, I have two secret rendezvous's

1473
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,240
out of there.

1474
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,240
So we like the lesbian.

1475
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:51,600
I, I like the lesbian video but the background isn't all that. The background itself is kind

1476

That's alright here on Orange Lounge Radio.

You are the sweetest of you and me, but you're not a kingdom, oh

01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,700
Crazy, it's all right, yeah, yeah

1500
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,700
Better keep my love, love, love

1501
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,700
Feels so light, didn't I know?

1502
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:02,700
When you say my name, I wanna hear your kindness

1503
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,700
Because you've been such a blast

1504
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,700
So just listen to me, and I'll talk to you

1505
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,700
I'm attending to you, I'm saying your sound

1506
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,700
But I wanna hear your fucking music now

1507
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,700
I wanna dance with the heart of music right now

1508
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,700
You don't have to realize that life is just let's get on

1509
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,700
Let's get on

1510
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,700
This is what I think about

1511
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:21,700
You are my station to me

1512
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,700
Let's get on

1513
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:25,700
This is what I think about

1514
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,700
You are my station to me

1515
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,700
It's all right, yeah, yeah

1516
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,700
There's a case for la-la-la

1517
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:36,700
It's all right in an old grave

1518
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:40,700
See, it's the light, yeah, the kick, but la, la, la

1519
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:43,700
See, it's the light, yeah, I know, ah

1520
01:46:43,700 --> 01:47:06,660
I'm gonna play, uh, we're coming back, well no, we're not gonna play anything else, we're

1521
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:10,660
just gonna come right back into this, hi, we're, we're looking at the votes, no, we

1522
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:14,660
We need a few more minutes to tally votes here. I'm just gonna play one quick, quick-ass song here.

1523
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:19,660
Uh, hell, let's, oh, this song's only, like, a minute, so, uh, overblast.

1524
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:21,060
What's all that?

1525
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,680
What's all that?

1526
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:33,820
What's all that?

1527
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,000
I need What's all that?

1528
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,180
I need What's all that?

1529
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,860
What's all that?

1530
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,860
More than that

1531
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:27,860
I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe!

1532
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:32,860
Mr. random person on the street, what do you think of the orange lounge pay money music and more show?

1533
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:39,860
Beautiful night, isn't it? It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a blood sucker.

1534
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:54,260
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1535
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,740
That was a promo, a very random promo, a fan promo that was sent to us.

1536
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,820
So if you want to make a promo for our show, put your own damn voice in it, do whatever

1537
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:08,460
the hell you want, send it to Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.

1538
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:13,260
And now, announcing our listless results, I tallied up all your votes in the chat room

1539
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:14,520
and here they are.

1540
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:29,980
They are the results for the listless best DDR background.

1541
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:37,940
In third place for the best DDR background of all time, Paranoia.

1542
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:47,140
For second place, the best DDR video of all time, Abyss, yay, and the very first place

1543
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:55,260
winner for best DDR background of all time, Get Up and Dance, yay.

1544
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:58,860
How about some more dollar, let's hear the last of the dollar MND interviews now, shall

1545
01:49:58,860 --> 01:49:59,860
we?

1546
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:00,860
Let's show.

1547
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:03,260
Alright, this is very short, we've only got a couple interviews in this segment, it's

1548
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:06,740
only about three and a half minutes left of interviews, but we do have the interview with

1549
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:09,220
dark sound and the reason why

1550
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:13,540
the webcast didn't work

1551
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:14,980
yeah we're interviews

1552
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:19,380
so go ahead and tell everyone who you are and what you do in the community

1553
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:21,320
hey what's up my name is Fuzzy Hat

1554
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,740
I'm basically

1555
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,140
the youngest drunkard in the DVR community

1556
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:27,460
and freestyler debonair

1557
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:31,180
so what are you doing in the tourney today, doing freestyle?

1558
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:34,660
I'm doing some freestyle, mingling with some people, macking some chicks, you know

1559
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:39,300
Basically all that good stuff and so who do you think is your main competition for a freestyle today?

1560
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,860
Main competition will definitely have to be the drunk Wendell and also the drunk reign of RTF

1561
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:52,180
So, uh, do you have any parting words for the listeners or the community in general listeners of the community? I just want to say that

1562
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:58,740
For six bucks a pitcher of Heineken that fills eight glasses and it's not a bad deal. That's all

1563
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:09,740
Thanks. So now the tournament is over, and my final interview of the day goes towards the man. So, tell us who you are and your history in the band wanted community. Briefly.

1564
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:13,740
Hi, I'm Ruben Avdea, otherwise known as DarkSound, the jerk-off on DDR3.

1565
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:21,740
My DDR history started a year ago with SVM closing, the day I started playing DDR. I've been mountain bikers ever since, I suppose.

1566
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:27,740
A sign of things to come, might I say. Just teasing. If you're out there, Ruben, I'm just teasing.

1567
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:32,240
I've been called a swiggler, an asshole, a jerk-off, and a really sexy guy.

1568
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,240
That was me, by the way. They called him that.

1569
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:39,740
Um, so today we had this really cool tourney, and it was cool.

1570
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,240
Uh, you got any questions?

1571
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:45,240
Did the tournament, um, for PA or for freestyle turn out how you expected it to?

1572
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:49,240
Um, PA actually took not as long as I expected it to,

1573
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:54,240
especially with the, uh, the added delay of trying to set up computers to work right.

1574
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,740
Um, we were planning to have...

1575
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:01,540
I'm planning to have a webcast going at the same time.

1576
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:05,940
Unfortunately, that did not happen because I forgot some cables.

1577
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:07,060
You heard it here first.

1578
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,380
He forgot cables.

1579
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:12,740
And that's why the webcast did not happen.

1580
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:19,140
So yeah, it took us an hour longer to set up than we thought it would.

1581
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:21,780
Fortunately, we were able to get replacement pads the other night.

1582
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:25,220
And everything from then on went pretty good.

1583
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:26,180
Any other questions?

1584
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,720
how about the uh...

1585
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:30,460
as far as you know who won this and that, what do you think?

1586
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,980
uh... i think uh... first and second place for Singles Freestyle was

1587
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,840
really close, much too close

1588
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,080
i would have actually hoped for a tide and something made that close

1589
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,840
Gumby shut the hell up

1590
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,160
uh...

1591
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,340
maybe you messed up again

1592
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,640
maybe i messed up?

1593
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:49,380
what if your face is messed up you fat four-headed freak?

1594
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:52,500
Gumby's in the chat room right now so i might say address those cards and

1595
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,760
letters to uh... rubin i think it's dark sound at spiggle

1596
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,980
uh... yeah i i i think i enjoyed freestyle it was uh... it was amazing i

1597
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,060
wish more people would have

1598
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:03,260
came you

1599
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:07,100
i'm sorry i'm sorry i was going to come but i couldn't

1600
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,460
and yet

1601
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:12,140
yeah uh... secrets of our children

1602
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:15,580
uh... so it was incredible uh... manager like

1603
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:19,140
turnout and got some money i had fun no way i didn't do that the raffle thingy

1604
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:19,740
that

1605
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:21,260
enterprise leftover

1606
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:27,380
people just take them? Damn, that sucks. Okay, never mind. But yeah. So yeah, it was an amazing

1607
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:31,660
day. I enjoyed myself. It's going to be a pain in the ass to clean up, but oh well.

1608
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:35,020
And what are your final words for the listeners of Board jobs?

1609
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:38,580
DDR sucks. Go play Mr. Driller.

1610
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:39,580
Okay.

1611
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,580
Amen.

1612
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,580
Thank you.

1613
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:47,660
And everybody, anybody have final words all at once to confuse the listeners? Absolutely

1614
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,660
nothing.

1615
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:51,860
pulled down his pants. Yeah, I pulled down my pants.

1616
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:55,540
Don't be pulled down his pants, and there you have it.

1617
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:58,820
This is my last special interview with Wendell, because he's cute.

1618
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:04,660
Hey, how's it going? We're tired people, and Wendell got drunk.

1619
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:10,100
And may I have my bat? Come back here. That's how it ended. You didn't even really

1620
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:13,380
interview Wendell, you just said, hey, how you doing? I interviewed him

1621
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:16,020
earlier. Yeah, he interviewed him earlier, but I mean, he was talking with a

1622
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:19,340
normal voice that I do want to know when those normal voices there you have it

1623
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:24,180
that was just happened right there so there's our coverage of the dollar

1624
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:28,140
Mindy tournament the first of many tournaments will be covering hopefully

1625
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:32,460
I'll be able to cover one in the future and Jamie did an excellent job with that

1626
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:39,940
yeah thank you for that Jamie here I guess we're pretty much towards the end

1627
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:43,260
of the show is there anything that you guys wanted to add here at the end of

1628
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:49,980
the show. Any final thoughts from the week? One plus one is two. There, I added. The lyrics

1629
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:56,300
to stick around. Well, actually, I have something constructive. It's the sim update for the

1630
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:04,580
week. Let's see here. We've got a DWI 2 version or 2.02 out. Unfortunately, it looks like

1631
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:08,380
the videos in the background don't work anymore. It works and it doesn't work and it works

1632
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:11,380
That's out with the new solo arrows, and yay.

1633
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:17,380
StepMania Beta 6 is rumored to be coming out pretty soon. I hope to see that. That should be nice.

1634
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:25,380
And Team Guilo's site is actually back up. I haven't gotten the actual link yet. It's not teamguilo.com anymore.

1635
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:31,380
It's off of someone's computer, so it's an actual IP address, and I have to find that and maybe post it somewhere.

1636
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:37,500
somewhere and that's about it. Oh, and Turning Mix 2 is still going so check out those entries

1637
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:42,220
if the server is not too clogged. And that's it.

1638
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:47,900
Any other final thoughts from people here? What the hell are you doing? Oh my god, Dave

1639
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,740
is like, we have this, we have what we call LSD here in the room, although it's actually

1640
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:55,380
that, I don't know if you remember this from high school, at least it was high school for

1641
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:58,660
me, those little nuclear warhead candies that you could put in your mouth.

1642
01:55:58,660 --> 01:55:59,660
It's the liquid version.

1643
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:02,760
Now these are liquid versions, they come in little bottles that look like LSD.

1644
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,980
It slipped out of my hand, um, in my mouth.

1645
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:09,500
You almost swallowed the actual bottle, like the whole thing?

1646
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:10,500
Yeah.

1647
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:14,700
He likes it so much, he tried to get the very last of it back into the plastic.

1648
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,520
You can just keep that bottle, because I don't even want it now.

1649
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,280
That's why it's not safe for three-year-olds, and it's not safe for Dave, either, apparently,

1650
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,280
so...

1651
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:24,280
Hey, did I choke?

1652
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:25,280
Did I choke?

1653
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,280
I'm still here.

1654
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,280
The bottle is in the trash.

1655
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,280
You were about to choke.

1656
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:34,120
She didn't do what I do and spit propel water all over the floor, you know, yay.

1657
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:35,120
You're going to clean that up, by the way?

1658
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,120
No, I'm just kidding.

1659
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:39,980
This gag was brought to you by Gatorade.

1660
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:43,280
Next week, as we mentioned towards the beginning of the show, Jamie will unfortunately not

1661
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,280
be here.

1662
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,280
I'm fortunate for us.

1663
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:46,280
Unfortunately, my half.

1664
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,280
Yeah, fortunate for her.

1665
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,280
I'm going to be in Vegas.

1666
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:51,040
She's going to be partying in Vegas with a bunch of the other DDR freaks, so that'll

1667
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,360
be a lot of fun.

1668
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:54,360
Maybe I can manage some interviews.

1669
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,840
Maybe you should get us some interviews.

1670
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,640
I think that would be a fine idea.

1671
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,640
Maybe.

1672
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,640
If you can swing. If you're not too drunk...

1673
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,640
You never know, the more interesting ones may happen while I'm drunk.

1674
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,640
Next week, your co-host will be the one and only Matt, also known as Loki,

1675
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,640
because he's been here every other show, so it just kind of makes sense right now.

1676
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,640
He's been a big part of the show, so he'll be the temporary co-host.

1677
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:16,640
Of course, he's always in the big...

1678
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:17,640
He's like our footstool, you know.

1679
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:18,640
Yeah, he's...

1680
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,640
He sits on the floor, so...

1681
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,640
We just rest our feet here?

1682
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:22,640
I'm just going to put my feet right here.

1683
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:25,640
No, he's always been a loyal supporter of the show since the beginning.

1684
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,640
Just like everybody here.

1685
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,640
Thanks, you guys, for showing up. I always appreciate it.

1686
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:30,140
Uh, any-

1687
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,140
We are LeFou.

1688
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,140
It's time for the final words.

1689
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:35,140
Bradley.

1690
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:36,640
Mmm, nothing to say.

1691
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,140
Nothing to say, as usual.

1692
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,140
Dave.

1693
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,140
Um, this one's for Brad.

1694
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:43,640
Cunt, cock, bitch, fuck, dick, math.

1695
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,640
Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1696
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:46,640
Math.

1697
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,640
All I have to say is M is the greatest song in the wor-

1698
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:50,140
Oh, wait, that was V.

1699
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,140
Never mind. M sucks.

1700
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,140
M is the greatest letter.

1701
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:56,140
Dude, no.

1702
01:57:56,140 --> 01:58:13,140
My final thought is tournaments need to be more like they were yesterday with the fun that went on and I had a good time and Matt wants my microphone and he can't have it.

1703
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:16,140
And so is Dave. God damn it! You whores!

1704
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:22,140
Actually, one more thing. I hope when they do post the videos for this tournament that they actually include a...

1705
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:31,140
Basically a mega-mix of all of Ruben's little acts in between the actual freestyle because that was great and I'd love to see that.

1706
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,140
Team Dave for life!

1707
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:38,140
Don't forget to listen to our Bimani Music and More program, always playing on the station when we're not around.

1708
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:41,140
Whore out the show to all your friends. We could use the listeners.

1709
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:44,940
But we love you for listening. Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We love you. Bye-bye.

1710
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:49,940
Tune in next week. I don't know what we're going to be talking about next yet, but it'll be a fun show. I promise you!

1711
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:57,940
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1712
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:06,140
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1713
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:10,140
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1714
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,140
Alcohol is your best friend.

1715
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:14,140
And weed. It's all about the crime.

1716
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:18,140
Heineken and weed, the perfect combination for a summer party.

1717
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,140
Only if you're over 21 though.

1718
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:22,140
I don't want you 18 year olds writing me or anything.

1719
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:24,140
I got eyes, I got busts, don't write me.

1720
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:26,140
I still say, bike it in and vodka.

1721
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,140
And stay away from Mark Kelly.

1722
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:30,140
And stay away from Mark Kelly, he's evil.

1723
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:32,140
I don't know about 15 year olds that wouldn't have gotten me.

1724
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:34,140
I wouldn't have bought a whole car.

1725
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:37,140
Diablo 2, and then I got Mack on the 14 year old at the junior high?

1726
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:39,140
Oh fuck. I got busted by the cops.

1727
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:43,140
If you ain't drinkin' rut, you ain't playin' rut. Holla!

1728
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:56,140
Sponsored by Heineken, Sapporo, Corona, Spotten Beer, Maui Waui, Mota, and other types of various melwachas to Amsterdam.

1729
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:58,140
And Guinness!

1730
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:00,140
And Guinness!

1731
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:03,140
And all the other Scottish shows, because if there's no Scottish, it's crap!

1732
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,140
That's right, fuck Budweiser!

1733
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:05,140
Budweiser's shit beer!

1734
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,140
Fuck that beer!

1735
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:07,140
Fuck Tequila!

1736
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:08,140
Tequila's Satan!

1737
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:23,820
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
