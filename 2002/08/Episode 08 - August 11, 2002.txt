DarkSakura TV
This is episode number 8 for August the 11th of 2002, and of course, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends tonight.
We've got Irene.
Hi.
Bradley.
Hello.
And Brad.
Hello.
Who's eating a donut.
And Tal.
Yo.
And this is the first time that Tal's ever heard the intro, also, I think.
It gets old really fast.
We're going to have a new one for Show 10.
Show 10, we get a whole new thing.
We'll have a whole new website and everything.
Yes.
It's going to be special.
We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
And I'm going to work in a request I've been trying to play for like the past three weeks.
But I know that Jamie has an extra special request to give out.
So this goes out to Kelly.
Happy birthday.
And here is your request.
Happy birthday to you.
Yeah, whatever.
We'll be back.
Can you keep me like a nasty girl?
You wanna nasty love?
I know that you want me honey, but feeling so much pain
Thanks for watching!
All the chains combined I don't wanna find my way to you I'd be reaching for my head Speaking the secrets of my heart To chase the sun
Thank you for watching!
Oh, Ash!
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
And that said, you heard a special request.
Bambi with Cowgirl and Mr. T, Take Me Higher from 2DX4 style, 2DX6 style, Silhouette of My Mind.
Oh, ass!
Jamie thinks quite the opposite of ass when it comes to Silhouette of My Mind.
That is like my favorite song and I have two fuck you's of the week now.
There's my music.
The last file is messed up.
Yep.
I just think it was funny how at least a good fifth of the people at the last Spiegel tournament were doing the booty dance.
That was awesome.
I remember seeing a routine where somebody was actually dancing to that song, and I swear it was like, if it wasn't the exact booty dance, it was heavily influenced by the 2DX4 style booty dancers.
and for those that don't know the 2DX4 style booty dancers, there are these two dancers that appear in probably five or six of the videos in 4Style.
I know they show up in Conga, Take Me Higher, what else?
Gary Gary Daddy.
Gary Gary Daddy.
No, they don't show up as star mine.
Shut up, Brad.
And Nasty.
Nasty.
Ooh, Nasty Bella.
Every time I hear Nasty, I think of the Janet Jackson song.
No, we're not talking about the booty dancers from Third Style, because Third Style also has, like, Third Style has some real, like, Jerry Springer, ghetto booty dancers.
The Fourth Style ones, though, were still booty.
They were like Booty Max.
Booty Max.
You know, Third Style may be Booty Deluxe, I don't know.
Remember the solo mix booty dancers?
No, what?
They were in the background of virtually every freaking thing on solo bass, and they were like ugly ass people who were just kind of busting their groove, I guess is the proper term for this.
Don't forget about... That's the reason to ban a solo machine.
About the badly animated booty dancers from the old Beat Manias.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
That's not even like real videos, that's just like bad crappy animation, like two frames a second animation of like... They sure are booty.
Alright.
Oh, we're also being asked in the chat room, when am we...
We are speak good!
We are speak good!
So that means that there's another half of her floating around that's sort of pulsing and bloody and gory?
Ew.
And on that note, oh, let me plug the chat room real fast.
If you want to join in our chat room festivities, all you have to do is join any other side IRC server.
So if you just go and download MIRC at MIRC.com, and then you're just going to connect to any other side IRC server like IRC.
I have to interrupt this.
What?
That was the gayest hand gesture I've ever seen Rob make.
Shut up.
It's radio.
They can't see that.
They can't see it.
It's radio.
I could help it.
I started eating.
Thank you for watching!
And they did it again!
Anyway, you can join our chatroom at irc.eggheads.org Make it stop!
Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
Is this what kind of show we're going to have tonight?
I mean, honestly.
Well, we had pita stokes last week.
You know, 310 Emmy and Pantsless Rage.
Oh, Matt's here.
Matt's tardy for once.
What kind of punishment do we have for Matt?
Get the duct tape.
Okay.
Anyway.
Frosted shit.
We can make him drink the cigarette tree out back.
Okay.
We're not going to get into that.
Anyway.
Back to the chat room.
Back to my fuck you of the week.
Yes.
They know how to join the chat room by now.
Just channel Orange Lounge.
All right.
Let's get into Jamie's FU of the week.
I have two fuck yous of the week.
The first one goes to my cat, Shermie.
I finally double A'd.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This song just isn't going to work.
If you're going to rant about Shermie...
Okay, for the Shermie rant, you know, I'm not, I know I'm not a really great 2DX player, you know, I'm getting better, but I finally PA'd Silhouette of My Mind, not PA, why did I say PA?
I finally double A'd Silhouette of My Mind.
Shermie walks behind my PlayStation 2 and unplugs it before it saves, and I haven't been able to do it since I had like three pours, and that was driving me crazy.
Now play my pissy music.
Okay.
Now for my real fuck you of the week.
It goes toward germs and viruses.
I fucking hate them.
Tuesday, I'm happy.
Dan takes me to RBGL and I'm playing five games of DDR in a row and feeling good and happy and proud of myself.
I wake up Wednesday dead sick.
And I have been sick.
I hate nature!
I just wish the world would explode!
And then I could take over hell.
Well...
Wasn't that nice?
I don't mean explode, I mean implode.
So it would be a big black hole.
I have an FU of the week too, but this is a little silly.
My FU of the week is white t-shirts.
Because as you can see, I was eating chocolate ice cream earlier, and I had it sitting on my lap like a little container of Ben & Jerry's, and now it looks like someone pooed a perfect circle right on my shirt.
It does look like dried shit.
Actually, it looks like someone took that cigarette can you got in your back and someone smeared all that juice right there.
Yes, you can do it.
Wait, I've...
I don't... Yeah, I do have that.
Hold on a minute.
I'm getting Brad's Pissed Off Music.
I know I have Sexy Planet in here somewhere.
You don't get Sexy Planet.
You're going to have to settle for something... What is this?
This works.
Fine.
Okay, see, I'm kind of getting... I think the Fuck You of the Week is getting a little old, so I'm going to do a Fuck Me of the Week.
Irene, would you fuck me?
Alright!
Thank you.
Not right now.
The bathroom is down the hall.
Okay, use the closet.
I have one thing to say about that.
That's all.
Thank you.
That's what I feel like doing.
It takes me a little bit of time to load the sounds.
I'm not super fast.
Five minutes ago, she called me.
Shut up.
Anyway.
Oh, they're already done.
The chat room wants to get in on the fun.
I've got another FU of the week.
Since this one comes from DSCS SoCalKicks, he's been a longtime supporter of the show, so I think he deserves a FU of the week.
What song will we give him?
We'll give him this.
We'll give him the Dancing Pumpkins song.
SoCalKicks gives FU because he could not connect to Orange Lounge Radio tonight for quite some time because of his cable internet provider.
So, big FU to Cox Cable Internet.
Yeah, DJ Suck Cox.
Cox Sucks Cox.
Hey, if Brad goes through on his offer, you'll be getting Cox Cable pretty soon.
One more whole show of internet access.
I love when this show resorts to potty humor.
I haven't mentioned that.
No, no, no, my turn, my turn, my turn.
Oh wait, you want Fairytale.
Oh, wait, this is for Matt?
Oh, Matt gets very tall.
I thought I had Rainy Men last week.
Yeah, that's true.
You got Rainy Men last time.
Okay, it's very subtle.
It's a subtle backdrop to your FU.
Okay, my minor FU of the week goes to last week's show and the very abruptly cutting off of my rant at the very end of the show for added humor purposes.
I didn't quite like that too much.
That's all.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
How about we say fuck you to the heat?
It's a hundred freaking goddamn degrees every goddamn day this week.
Well, you see, Tal, this is an international show now.
We have people in all different countries and all places in the United States listening to this show.
And in some places in the world, believe it or not, it is cold.
Fuck them, too.
But, you know, isn't it still typhoon season in Japan?
I don't know.
I remember my ex... Do I look like the weather girl?
My ex-t roommate Candice was in Tokyo and she was telling me about how people, like, go to work during typhoon.
Well... My girlfriend's in Japan and she says it's just really hot.
Okay.
I think your girlfriend's just really hot.
Well, you're gay, so it doesn't matter.
Oh, the cat's out of the bag, Rob.
You don't know me.
You don't know a thing about me.
Are you gay?
Are you gay?
Are you gay?
Are you gay?
Are you gay?
Huggism Huggism Ace
One of our last 3rd Koreans in town finally got upgraded to a Max 2.
They should just give it to me.
But what do you think of this?
It seems like everybody who had a 3rd Korean now has a Max 2 or a 5th.
Like everybody's upgrading to 3rd Koreans, but do you think that's a bad thing?
Well, first of all, Max 2 kits are really easy to find for certain reasons that we don't want to accuse people of.
Bootlegs?
I'd say it.
No, you go I don't know, I'm not really missing third tree And I went and tried to play one the other day And now, forgive me, I started I really got playing on fifth makes I got good on sixth and better on seventh I went back to try to play third I couldn't see the goddamn arrows for one That's your problem
They do grade harder on 3rd Koreans And 3rd Koreans are hella hard I mean, obviously you've tried to play SSR You probably grew up on that machine and stuff But I really don't miss it at all Sky was trained on a DDR USA machine You know what?
I can totally one-up it Yeah, I know, I know, girl I started on a 3rd mix and played a lot on a 1.5 Yeah, I used to play in the bathtub
and, uh, this is about DDR.
For, uh, Tyler here, uh, why don't you call the whambulance?
I swear to God I'm going to fire you from this show.
Just kidding.
I didn't hire him.
Fire me.
I'm not even getting paid.
Somebody needs to tell Milton that we fired him a year ago.
You are getting paid, you're just not getting the money.
You're getting paid in donuts.
Oh wait, you bought the donuts.
But if they take his stapler, he'll set the building on fire.
Set the building on fire.
I'm sorry, yes, you have a comment?
He's getting into my head.
Somebody brought donuts?
Matt runs out of the room.
Well, anyways, 3rd VK, it's not really that good of a machine.
It's old, it's nostalgic, it's got gentle strats, strictly business.
But, I mean, really, think about it, the Max 2 has just got so many more songs, so many... It's new, you know, like the guy keeps saying in 4th Mix over and over.
It's new!
3rd Korean, excuse me, it is the shit.
It's the poopy!
We need to bring on our filters.
Oh, you just got hit by the filter.
It's the poopy.
Third Korean is the... Poopy!
Freaking poopy.
It's the freak poopy.
I like the third Koreans because there's just so many cheesy third mix songs that are just so much fun.
Like all the good erotic songs were in third mix.
Do It All Night, Oh Nick, Turn Me On were all in third mix.
Although you can play them all in fourth mix.
There's something about being able to play like... What do I like in third grade?
Starion?
Hogism?
I even like the regular third mixes.
The third mix has this nostalgic value for me because it was my first DDR machine.
I had been playing on second mix since April 2000.
I had played on the first mix for PlayStation in February 2000, but I went to Anime Expo and there was this gorgeous looking third mix machine, and I freaking saw SSR the first time and thought I was about to pee my pants or something.
Jamie does win the award, by the way.
for being the most old school.
Congratulations.
Yay.
All right.
Sorry, the only fanfare I have is like an hour long, so.
If it counts, I saw DDR in 1999 and thought it looked stupid.
I was busy playing Buster Move 2.
Right on.
So we've talked about Bomani's Path.
Anybody else want to say anything about 3rd Korean, and are we going to miss it at all, or...
I don't get that, that was confusing.
as you said, the third got no play and then you're saying it'll still get no play but it'll get more play than it ever did well if it got no play and it's gonna get no play now then it's never gonna get any play oh, sure, inject your logic into everything you're not getting any play you get no dub, no dub from me you know yes I'm, see the machine
Everyone's going to attach their own value.
Everyone has their favorite mix.
Like, I still think to this day my favorite overall would have to be second.
Yes.
Why?
Oh, I know why.
Because... I know why.
It has freaking battle mode.
That's step battle, yes.
Step battle owns...
Oh, they are warning you.
Some of the locals that chat in the chatroom, Matt, are warning you no memory card slots at Folsom Game Room.
Sorry.
Duh.
One thing I do have to say that I like for the mixes after 3rd is that the old 3rd mixes had the memory card slots in the back of the machines.
Oh, really?
That I remember.
I don't remember ever seeing one of those.
I thought they had them in the back of the machines.
I remember.
They're asking us... Are you guys okay there?
Are you getting situated?
Are you getting a little too hanky-panky back there?
Anyway, we need to... I remember hearing that older mixes had them in the back of the machines.
Someone in the chat room is asking about the battle mode that was in 4th Mix.
Well, it's not in Kona Mix, and that battle mode is different from the one that was Step Battle in 2nd Mix.
Step Battle in 2nd Mix had blocks of arrows go up where both players go and...
Well, shut the hell up.
Ah, they're just messing with us in the chat room.
The step battle was this different feature in Second Mix.
A lot of people haven't seen it, but what it was, basically, you could dance a particular pattern, and then your opponent had to dance that too, right?
Yeah.
Basically, you would have all four arrows, but they would be basically clear.
They would come up in a particular pattern, and you would follow that pattern stepping on whatever you wanted to.
Of course, you couldn't do more than two arrows at a time.
and then they would come up red for the ones that you picked and blue for the ones that your opponent picked, but you still had to dance them all.
Very cool.
And it can get intense, you know, you have to be really good at sight reading.
So out of second mix's step battle, third mix's unison, and fourth mix's battle, what was the best?
The one that was in Disney's rave home version.
No, was that adoption?
No, there was A, B, and C. There was no D. C...
I didn't really, like, because I played a second mix and I guess maybe I just couldn't hear it or something.
But it was like, I didn't get it.
I was just like, what the hell is going on?
What the hell is unison mode?
I never ever figured that out.
Basically, unison mode was you had one set of arrows in the middle of the screen.
And, like, you both had to dance the green ones and then, like, one person had to do the red ones.
It's like the battle mode, but it was harder because there's only one set going up the middle.
You got it.
Hey, they're going to fight.
That was the best part about 4th Mix's battle was it goes, they're gonna fight!
And then like, if you're in an arcade where the machines turned up really loud and the announcer says that, you'll get a bunch of those kids that call DDR gay and stuff, they'll turn around and go, what?
I remember playing the one on third mix, me and my girlfriend tried to do Jam Jam Reggae Maniac.
Now, Jam Jam Reggae Maniac is hella hard to begin with, especially when it's flat and the colors are all weird.
And we tried it, and we had no idea how to play a unison mode to begin with.
So it was like, what the fuck?
They're red and green and blue!
I stand corrected.
The arrows that both people have to dance to are actually yellow.
Green was fourth mixes.
Yeah.
I actually do think that I like the 1 and 4th mix better overall, but you know, still for purely nostalgic value, the second mix, Battle Mode, was really fun.
It's that battle.
Oh, you'd like this suggestion we're getting in the chatroom, Jamie.
Jabberwocky wants to make a DDR Puyo Puyo mix game.
Now, actually, if I'm not mistaken, there is a Bomani Puyo Puyo game, correct?
It's not Bomani.
Well, okay, I'm sorry, yeah.
It's not Bomani.
It's Bomani-like.
I can't believe it's not Bomani.
It basically plays almost exactly like Parappa, where you have your... I mean, the pattern's a little bit more complex, but you have your patterns come up, and, you know, your characters dance to it.
For those that don't know what Puyo Puyo is, it's probably best known in the States as Kirby's Avalanche.
Puyo Pop for Game Boy Advance.
Or didn't you have a Sonic version of it too on Sega?
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Mean Machine.
And yes, I do own that version too.
I have all kinds of versions of Puyo Puyo, but that's besides the point.
Okay, we've talked about some old school Bomani stuff.
Let's talk about some new school.
If that's a term I can use, new school.
New school.
DDR Max USA, some slight new news on it.
I mean, this was something I kind of already been assumed, but it has been confirmed by Konami of America.
We are going to have licensed tracks in Max USA, and not only are they licensed, they're going to be exclusive.
So that means they're new.
It's new!
On top of that, there's really not much else to add until we get further announcements.
I think Max is still, what, about three months out for USA?
So we'll probably be getting some more songs in the next few weeks.
Did you have something to say?
See, I thought you were raising your hand.
Anyway, anybody want to comment on that news or...
Isn't it coming out in November or was it October?
I don't remember really.
But I'm just waiting to play something like Sonomalette 0.5 speed, you know?
Is it going to replace our USA machine at RVGL, do you know?
Or are they going to replace USA's?
It's not an arcade machine, it's a home version.
And by the way, just my own little happy New Bay Money news, in five weeks I'll have my 2DX controller.
But yeah, there's no Konami of America arcade unit anymore, so there isn't going to be any upgrades ever.
Not true, not true.
They still could distribute through their third-party distributor, whoever they're going to team up with.
So there's really, we don't know what direction that's going to take it.
It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing, but probably going to be a good thing.
We just don't know.
So it's too early to say.
All we've got on the front now, though, is this new home version.
It will be special.
So...
Okay, anyone else want to say anything about Max USA coming up?
No, I mean, we just don't know a lot.
It's new!
It's new!
And that's about all we can say to it right now.
I'm hoping we can get some interviews in the future on this show with people that could tell us more, but we'll see.
We'll see if they'll even call us, or if they'll even talk to us.
Who are you?
What is this Orange Lounge show?
What I always do that works is you poison them first, and then you say if you want the antidote, then you gotta do the interview.
Stop it.
Anyway, also new, new school, Euromix 2.
It's pretty much, from what I'm hearing, it's Max 2 without everything good in it.
Like, Oni modes and... The interface is so freaked up, it's not even funny.
Actually, there is a pretty decent review of it on the DDR Freak boards in the United Kingdom Forum.
Really nice review, first-hand experience.
Which I believe links to another site called... I think it's musicgames.com.
I don't remember the site of it.
Dancing Games, thank you.
It's dancinggames.com, which is, I believe, a Euro-based site.
Something like that.
They'll tell us.
Pretty much, it's Max 2 without the Onis, without any unlocks that we know of.
Moreover, it's got the thing where you have to pick your difficulty after you pick the song.
It doesn't tell you the difficulty beforehand.
Yep, no groove meter.
And it's like USA, where you have to pick the song first, and then you'll pick the difficulty.
It's got some ridiculous looking... I mean, the song selection looks really cool, though, and it's got some of the Oni Mode songs already unlocked to be able to play, like Hysteria, and I forget which other ones.
But, I mean, think about it.
You can play the new songs with three levels of difficulty, and none of them are actual Oni difficulty level, I would think.
I'm being corrected on the site, that's actually dancegames.com is the name of the site.
We were close enough, alright.
So that'll be interesting to hear more about.
There's all sorts of new songs in there.
You get to dance now to Nick Carter and Steps.
Isn't that amazing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Aaron Carter.
Nick's the one that's actually a Backstreet Boy, huh?
Does the excitement ever start?
From what I... I haven't heard much about the steps, but I guess it's nothing too special, or we would have heard more about them.
I'm sure we'll see them for The Sims pretty soon, so we'll have to wait for this.
Good deal, good deal.
And for those of you who have been dying to dance to this song, for those of you who have been dying to dance to this, Kylie Minogue, Can't Get You Out of My Head.
I'm sorry, I can't hear the song without thinking of that one video from Anime Expo.
The Dancing Stage Party for the Euro Playstations will have Can't Get You Out of My Head by Kylie Minogue along with other songs.
An unknown Bloodhound Gang song I know is on the list.
Bloodhound Gang, oh.
We don't know.
But if you've ever just been dying to dance to those songs.
Thank you.
So that'll be coming out soon, and I haven't heard much about that.
I guess it's supposedly some kind of... Oh, Matt seems to know.
It's got the nice new shiny cabinet.
Oh, you're talking about the home version.
Yes, the home version.
Now, I saw pictures of the new Euromix cabinet.
It doesn't look any different at all.
It's just like a darker silver chrome color.
Well, it's got hardware upgrades, supposedly.
No one really seems to know.
But apparently Euromix 2 doesn't use it.
Thanks for watching!
But the home version thing, I'm still saying I'm jealous because the Europeans have two exclusive mixes with licensed songs in them, whereas we had two regurgitated pieces of shit, and now we're finally getting some new shit.
So what's up with that?
Well, I guess the whole theory is, though, is to get the new shit, you have to play the old shit.
Basically, is that they've got to prove that the old shit's successful to invest money in the new shit, basically.
Yeah, but that's not the point.
Like, Konami didn't want to spend, because licenses in America are expensive.
I mean, look at how much they're charging internet radio out there to play.
Well, you know, it's expensive, though.
Well, I point out to you also, like, when we're talking about licenses, Britney's dance beat has only five songs on it.
Five songs, that's all they could afford to put on the damn game.
So, basically, it's a matter of... You would buy a Britney Spears game anyway.
Because it's by the... Well, it's a good half an hour long rental.
But, um... I still would not pay money for anything with Britney Spears in it.
Because my money is worth more than, uh... than your tits and ass, I guess.
Basically, the bottom line on why we get recycled stuff is basically, it's kind of like... I guess it's kind of having to prove yourself.
Unfortunately...
I think a lot of folks at the Konami of Japan who kind of have the rights to all the DDR stuff, they don't really believe the DDR has kind of taken off here yet.
They give up, let them move in every mix.
Well, let's release this and see how it does over there.
And then now that it's doing well, it's like, okay, we'll give more of the rights and let you license your own stuff and spend the money on that and all that stuff.
So, yes, I'm being also mentioned in the chat room saying radio stations give out million dollar prizes.
They have money.
Not this one.
No.
I pay to do this show.
You can give me a dollar.
If you want to send us money, hey, great.
Maybe we'll set up a PayPal thing.
I don't know.
Yes.
Send us a dollar of nine and you get a vanilla cup.
Yats can get it.
Anyway, so we'll see.
As soon as we get more news on Max USA, we'll definitely give it over to you guys.
Also new, being location tested.
We talked about this last week on the show a little bit.
8th Style is brand new and is being location tested in Japan right now.
And some of the MP3s got leaked, but they were kind of bad quality.
However, now we've got some very good quality 2DX 8th Style MP3s that have been leaked to the internet.
And they've just spread around like a bad case of an aerial disease.
They're all over now.
But in case you haven't heard them yet...
I'm going to play them for you right now.
And they're all really good, in my personal opinion.
They sound a lot like the stuff that came out of Beatmania 6 plus Core Remix, and a lot of the same artists are there, such as my favorite Pink Pong and Athletics and such.
A lot of the new songs I like a lot, but most Beatmania purists, I guess, aren't very fond of the way it is.
Well, we shall see.
Let's see what the chat room thinks of these.
I'm going to play three songs in this break from 2DX 8th Style.
We're going to hear, starting off, Tiger Yamato with V35, and then we're going to hear Mr. T with Airflow, and we'll hear Pink Pong with Star Dreams.
So I'm going to play those three for you.
We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back to talk about 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you.
Thanks for watching!

Jamie doing a little reprise of the chicken there.
I think he just blew out somebody's speaker there.
It's a chicken getting raped, dude.
You just heard...
Three songs, brand new, just all over the internet like a wildfire this week.
They're shiny.
They're shiny, spankin' new.
We heard first, we heard Tiger Yamato with V35.
He's a spank.
Second was Mr. T with Airflow, and lastly, Pink Pong with Star Dream.
A little promo for that other show on Saturday nights, UnderSedationLive.org, a fun little program I've participated in.
It's special.
And Jamie participates in quite frequently lately.
Yeah, I'm the number one guest.
Last night was a very neat show because for the first time,
Travis played during one of the breaks a 2DX song, which is very scary if you know Travis because he really just thinks Bomani people are dorks, but in a good way.
Never Look Back, which is a cool song, because it's goth.
It is a cool song, I agree.
But that's a fun show, and if you like what we do here, you should definitely tune into that.
It's super fun.
I don't know how else to explain it, really.
Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...
Anyway, going back to 2DX8's style, what do y'all think of the music?
What do you think of Aderd's style so far?
It's special and shiny.
I'm sorry, but that one Tiger Yamato track freaking sounds like it's Taka.
You think maybe somebody messed up on the labeling?
I don't know, but it sounds like Taka.
They're probably all the same people.
They're all Nalki!
Well, yeah!
I mean, the one thing that surprised me, of course, about the list so far, and I do realize it's only a test location list, so obviously not everything that's going to be new to 8thStyle has been leaked to the internet yet.
No TAC yet, which is kind of surprising.
Which is a crime.
But we're just thinking he's taking a little summer vacation and he'll be back.
I made up a money funny.
That was a real D-Slapper.
Anyway.
No, no, no, no, no, there cannot be a 2DX without my man in it.
I'm being told that also, now I thought this was rumor, but it's being brought up again, Max 3 is supposedly location testing too, but from what I had heard, somebody actually that's in Japan that posts on some of the message boards locally went to the arcade that's supposedly location testing and didn't see it.
So I bet it's probably one of those cases where it's going to be really soon we're going to start hearing the Max 3 location tests if it's not already out, but we haven't heard anything yet.
But anyway, 2DX, 8style, location testing To me, it sounds very much like 5Key music And obviously that's a big duh, because they're both Beatmania And a lot of the 5Key artists, now that Beatmania the final is gone Don't really have a resource, so they're going to have to go to 2DX to put their songs in I think it kind of sounds a lot like the music in 6, plus core to me
Okay, well, way off topic here since you mentioned Max 3.
I heard actually that one of the songs, Crash, that's going to be on Max 3 is actually a heavy metal song, which is kind of cool.
That would be interesting.
But back to 8th Style, I mean, think about it.
It's just like a lot of the Keyboard Mania 4th Mix rumored thing.
A lot of those artists were saved and brought into 6th Style, like Frozen Ray and a bunch of other 6th Style songs that you know should have been Keyboard Mania but aren't.
Yeah, that was always kind of my thought, especially if you, uh, the one song, Deutz de Fatima by Osama Kubota is not Douche de Fatima, is that what you're calling it?
Is it really?
I thought it was Douche de, whatever it's called.
If it's really French, it's Dwatz.
It's Dwatz.
Dwatz?
It's like, uh, Dwatz de Fatima.
Dwatz de, whatever.
Whatever the hell it's called.
Y'all know what song I'm talking about by this one.
It's the one that goes, that song.
Does not sound like ever a 2DX song ever, but it sounds like Keyboard Mania to me.
The reason why I think it's French, by the way, is because that's French for right.
But Fatima is Portuguese and Latin for marry.
I figured out what it is.
I figured out what it is.
It's just a bunch of languages and they butchered them all and they stuck them in one together and fucking shit, cock, cunt, suck, fault.
Give me that.
Whatever happened to the actual licensed songs that they were talking about for 8th style, like Daft Punk and that kind of stuff?
Don't know.
Location tests don't usually have licensed songs in them, so we don't know.
But yeah, Team Guilo, before they went down, they rumored to put on Apex Twins' Girl Boy song as one of the test songs for 8th style.
And if that is true, then I would, like, die.
Because that's, like, one of the coolest songs ever.
I think they took somebody's, you know, little files for their home version and stuck it in the arcade to test it.
What, how they tested the 8th style?
How they got those MP3s?
I was joking.
I really have nothing to say about that.
Well then why did you take the microphone, honestly?
Because she knew you'd take it eventually.
Dude, he's such a mic whore.
We're going to have to get him a little headset like Matt had the first two weeks.
Well, thank you for calling Orange Lounge.
May you help me?
I'll just have to put you on hold until you can learn to speak in a more professional manner.
Yes, he worked in the call center for two years.
2DX8Style, what else did I want to say about it?
There was something.
It's special!
It's a special.
It's new!
It makes me tingle.
Down there?
No.
That's what the show's for.
Is it like dolphin blue?
Or head and shoulders?
It makes my scalp sparkle.
How about any other songs you guys liked for those of you that have heard all of the 8Style tracks to date?
Dancer's pretty fucking cool.
Yay!
Dancer rules!
Yeah, because it's like something you'd expect more in Guitar Freak's drum mania, but it kind of reminds me of Kiriyama Oka's Diamond Jealousy, which I really like.
So, yeah.
Way to go.
Yay!
Meltdown!
Meltdown!
Just a bunch more Eurobeat, because I thought the sixth style was 2DX Parapara edition.
I don't know if I should hit the keys or start waving my hands around.
Huh?
What?
You want this microphone?
Huh?
Huh, Sal?
Huh?
We have taunting going on.
The new Naoki song actually sounded really good.
I forget.
It's the one that's got...
It's not polytery!
And everybody cheers!
It's not polytery!
The song in the background, Youthful Urges, also known as Blue Impulse.
That is the Naoki.
For once, he ditched Politary and went with somebody named Yuki.
No!
I'm not starting the Politary debate again on this show.
As long as it's not Politary, I'm a happy girl.
I... What?
Yes?
I'm gonna choke on this microphone right now.
Whatever happened, weren't they supposed to get another chick for Dive?
Like, when DDR Max came out, you know how Dive has four people?
Weren't they going to get a fifth person?
Whatever happened with that?
Polite Jerry killed her.
I guess somebody realized, oh, I'm sorry, what the hell am I saying?
I'm sorry, a fifth girl for Dive.
I'm talking B for You, not Dive.
B for You sings Dive.
Be4U.
They were supposed to get a fifth chick in Be4U, and that didn't happen.
Politary scalped her, wore her scalp, and just, like, started singing Be4U songs.
I thought that one person had left, and they got a replacement, so that would make it to four again, right?
Yeah, I think that's actually what happened, but the thing is, I always thought that Naoki would just cross-dress and do it.
Yeah, yeah.
Because everybody thinks Naoki's a woman anyway.
I'm sorry, but Naoki's pretty good looking.
It is a woman.
Naoki is a very pretty man.
Naoki...
The Aoki is about as ambiguous as Gackt.
Let's put it that way.
Dude, he's pretty too.
I'm sorry, Gackt is funny.
Now, this is in the chat room.
Here's a line.
There's a line here.
According to Irene, he's Hodor-y.
Align here in the chatroom.
This would be a great Oni course.
Naoki not featuring Politary.
Yes.
That would be the best non-stop course ever.
Who said that?
Who said that?
That was DarkTetsuya, our friend.
I'm sorry, DT, you like our winner now.
Are you sorry?
Oh, I got an idea.
I got an idea.
How about the Politary course, not featuring Naoki?
It'll just be her singing.
No music, nothing.
God, then we can really tell how terrible she is.
I cry.
Player's worst.
I'm the first winner.
No, I mean loser, actually.
Thanks for watching!
Shut up!
Anyway, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, because we're seeing lots of people coming into the chatroom now, and you want to join the party, just go to Channel Orange Lounge.
Hey, Mr. DJ.
Anyway, sorry, inside joke.
If you want to join the Orange Lounge party, just join Channel Orange Lounge.
There's a party in my pants.
Anyway...
Any other side IRC server, it's listed on your MIRC list of servers.
Bongo is demanding to hear some Politary.
Bongo, shove it.
I love you, Bongo.
Bongo, we must marry.
I will allow you to date with me.
I have to go smite Brad now.
Pop!
Listen to Orange on Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
Sorry, Bongo.
If you were a bouncer at Club Top Academy, you'd get laid.
Anyway, we're going into all sorts of inside jokes on this show, and people are just kind of probably looking at this going, train wreck.
Although, we kind of already have that reputation, I'm sure.
Well, we've got people listening, so apparently it's not that bad.
Oh, we just had one drop.
Hey, hey, pantsless rage.
3-2 Debbie.
We need ratings.
That only worked last week, dear.
Speaking of which, oh, that does make me think, though.
DDRPC.
I got to play it a little more.
and unlocked some new... We were talking last week about hacking the characters.
Anyway, some new characters that are unlocked in TDRPC.
There's a character called Brother, who's a... Shaft!
He pretty much... Shut your mouth!
He's a cross between Shaft and Jam Jam Reggae, pretty much.
The whole little reggae hat thing.
And his name's Brother.
He's a brother.
Brother.
And then the other unlockable characters are Ruby and Sapphire, which are...
Which is pretty much, they kind of look like... Aren't those Sailor Moon characters or something?
I'm not sure.
No.
But it looks like... I don't think there's a Ruby Moon in Cardi B or Sakura.
It kind of looks like a cowboy and a cowgirl.
Ruby and Sapphire is kind of what they look like.
Sapphire's a guy?
Yeah.
Sapphire's a boy.
It's Falky!
Oh my god.
And then one of the other unlockable characters is Pink-Haired Emmy.
Or, not Emmy, Pink-Haired Lady.
Lovely.
She's from Second Mix or something.
Oh, if you're in the chat room right now, SoCalKicks on his lovely little site at SoCalKicks.com has some articles with pictures if you want to go see.
I know that because I gave him the picture of Brother.
And Angel Zukin.
And actually speaking of SoCalKicks, I think it's about time for me to once again repeat the challenge.
Alright, go for it.
Why not?
Both of my edits can be found on his page, I hope still.
If not, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.
OrangeloungeRadio at yahoo.com.
All one word.
And I will get you the Dex files for it for my Look to the Sky edit called Free Fall.
The first person to send me proof... Excuse me, Mr. SoCalKicks.
Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner for you!
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Hello.
Did you hurt yourself?
I think we have an injury.
Do you need a band-aid?
Do you need some vodka?
What do you need?
I'm okay.
Alright, I'm okay.
SoCalKick, send me a private message with your email and I'll make sure Matt gets it.
Because Matt has an assload of edits.
There's really no other way to describe it.
He just has an assload of edits.
He's got like J-Lo's leftover ass of edits.
Everything they took off of Ricky Lake, he's got in edits.
I just killed the show.
That was funny.
Anyway.
That was wrong.
Anyway, why don't we take a break now?
Gee, break.
What did I say I was going to play this break?
Oh, I said I'd play Jack and Mark Get Busy.
Yes.
And let's do another 8-style song.
How about... No, I want to do... Let's do Rainbow.
Oh, we want to do the Naoki song?
Why not?
Why not?
We'll get that in there and some other crap.
So enjoy.
Yeah.
We'll take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Rokkata!
Toshiki!
Jojo!
Miyato!
The King!
JoJo!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Dome's been-running music in more shows?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
The chat room, they seem to think Lab's okay.
Don't really care for Dancer, though.
They disagree with Brad and Irene in that respect.
But Brad and Irene went home, so they are not here to defend themselves.
So I guess the chat room wins that one.
So I can say this.
Politary sucks!
I hate her!
Die, die, die!
Also, we're kind of...
Thank you.
Yay for pizza.
And this yay for pizza was brought to you by Propel Water, put out by Gatorade.
And I was going to let Matt give a sim update, but he left to go get pizza, so now I'm stuck with nothing.
We'll have to tell Potty Joke.
I will give the sim update.
The best way to kill sims is to put them in a pool and remove the ladder.
I'm being sent files.
I don't know if this is a good thing or not.
We'll find out here.
You can also teach sims how to barbecue.
and then if you give them a low personality rating, when they set themselves on fire, nobody will come to help them.
I would love to know what SoCalKick sent me this file for.
It's a picture of his cable provider or something.
Are they exploding?
No, not yet.
It says his picture.
Look at... Jeez.
I don't know.
Anyway.
It's a thingy.
You want to give any more shoutouts to any of your friends that are listening?
Um, hi people who are listening.
I see some new faces in the chatroom tonight, very cool.
I mean, we never have a look.
Hi people!
Hello people in the chatroom, you're so cute.
I just want to eat them all up.
Oh, wow, hey.
With some fava beans.
And a fine Chianti.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So if you see a short girl wearing glasses come out of the Star Trek experience all fucked up That is the best place to get drunk in Vegas, by the way You'll know who had the Warp Core Breach You know you're a geek when That was, you know, sad but true, that was the first place I ever got really fucked up I love the Warp Core Breach The Star Trek experience on a Warp Core Breach Which for those that don't know It doesn't last, though For those that don't know, seven different kinds of Bacardi Sobe and Razzmatazz, all mixed in a fishbowl And some really freaking good juices mixed in with it, too And dry ice
So Jamie will not, unfortunately, be with us in a couple weeks, but we will somehow survive and the show will go on.
Who knows, maybe I'll be the one.
Matt's been dying to co-host a show, and I think he's been here every week since week one.
Why not?
We'll let Matt co-host a show for once.
Oh, Matt's back.
Hey, Matt, want to give us a sim update?
Are you too busy?
Let us finish chewing.
Swallow, Matt, swallow.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Anyways, as of today, see, there's a new DWI that just came out.
I believe it's 2.01.
Supposedly fixed some stuff.
One thing they added is percentages on the score screen.
So if you hit the upper left button, I believe it should put up percentages.
And very...
I was getting kind of close there.
Now it can hold 2048, so...
And for those that don't believe him, I will vouch for this.
His sim has so many freaking songs in it.
It was damn near pushing that number, yes.
So that's pretty much what's going on there.
Another thing that's pretty cool is DDR Maniacs, I think I might have mentioned it last week, is doing the user submitted files now.
And one of the files that they have on there is Ooh La La from Dancing Stage 1-5, the beta, I believe.
And it was one of the original songs that was going to be on Dancing Stage Euromix that was actually going to have three arrows at one time on there.
Or four, I can't remember.
I haven't played it yet, but...
That was actually going to be one of the songs that was supposed to be on DDR a long time ago.
Interesting.
So look for that.
What happened?
It just didn't make it in DDR?
It just didn't make it.
There was three songs that got cut.
I believe there was one by Run DMC also, so they all got cut.
Interesting.
And Team Guilo is still down, very sad, and that also means that DDR PC Central is also down, or the Melting Pot.
A moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
and also Tourney Mix 2 on DDR East Coast Invasion.
You'll probably start seeing the files pretty soon because they said they're releasing them on the 15th.
So, probably this week.
Cool.
Well, the 15th is this week.
Yes.
That would make sense.
Alright, that's it.
Thank you for that lovely update on the sim scene.
Back to potty jokes.
Poop!
Anyway.
Oh, ass!
Somebody suggested a good idea in the chat room that maybe you want to beg and plead anybody that might be coming through Sacramento that's going to the big tournament in Concord this weekend, you know, about your situation.
Well, if anybody can give me a ride to Concord, hey, I'll pay for a gas lunch.
Hey, hey.
So if you don't think you're capable of getting that look to the sky edit done, you don't think you're ever going to combo that.
You're not going to get as nice of a lunch for the another edit.
The another edit's going to have a nice lunch.
Yes, the another edit.
If you don't think you're going to be able to full combo the another edit anytime soon, come get Jamie and take her to Concord, because she needs it.
She needs a ride.
I'll give you pizza.
The big tournament in Concord, we'll give a shout out to this, because DarkSound's our buddy.
And he's doing a little tourney, putting together one on Saturday in Concord.
Dollar Mendy's Summer Vacation, I believe it's called.
And it's sure to be exciting.
It's going to be the very first...
One, broadcast over the internet.
They're going to have a little streaming thing going on there.
If I recall the page correctly, it's tunak.floop.net.
I am not sure.
That's probably it.
That sounds like it to me.
But you can also, on the tournament's discussion thread, I'm sorry, not thread, but forum on DDR Freak, there is a link to the page and some feedback on what's going on.
Cool.
It has the best freestyle category ever.
Waste of two minutes of my life and I want it back.
Right on.
That would be the one I would enter if I were to enter freestyle.
You would have to bat.
Oh yeah, we should get the bats.
I'm taking the bat to bang people over the head with.
Thanks for watching!
We might be involved on another level, but I don't know yet.
We're still dotting our I's and crossing our T's on that.
We don't know yet.
Pay close attention to the station.
Pay close attention to our website the next few days.
You may find some interesting news, but I don't know yet.
We'll see.
We have to have our people call their people and all that stuff.
but we know for sure we'll at least be covering it because Jamie's going to be going to the tournament assuming she gets a ride and doing some interviews.
I'll get there one way or another.
She'll be doing her woman on the street interviews.
I'm sorry?
We'll have Bradley do interviews.
We should have Bradley do interviews.
I think my idea for Bradley because Bradley Bradley kind of gets the rep on the show for not talking much I think I would like Bradley to do the interviews like at Golfland with the people who just look really scary and don't do anything with Bomani I'd love to get a microphone in front of Bradley and make him interview those people that would be fun won't you think Bradley?
no comment fair enough Matt has something he wants to say after I'm done chewing here but anyways swallow Matt swallow
Okay, glad I got that down.
Anyways, Jamie, I hate to do this to myself since I've pushed it back three weeks now.
Damn Cusar trip.
I may be able to give you a ride down the concrete.
I'll go ahead and do that, maybe push it back another week or so, or just stick with this to seven, and we'll go then.
And I'll just give you a ride down there.
You officially get the My Hero of the Year award.
This one's for Matt.
This one's for Matt.
Here you go.
That just really gets my heart.
We're going to take another really quick break because I'm selfish and I have to pee.
So we take a break when I have to pee.
You should have gone before we left.
Unless I can just get up and go.
Go pee!
Alright, fine.
It's the Jamie show now.
Have fun.
I have both of the mics in my hand.
I'm going to give the microphone to the microphone whore.
Yeah, that'll probably make some weird echo if you're talking in both mics at once or not.
But, um... Someone wants to get fucked.
Who wants to get fucked?
I don't know, who wants to get fucked?
Someone in the chatroom wants to get fucked.
Uh, who's he talking about?
Um... Sukkot Kix, dude, who are you talking, who wants to get fucked?
I don't know, come on.
He just says yes.
You wanna get fucked?
Yay!
He wants to get some!
No.
Um, you know what, I think actually at this point, you know, perhaps it might be in our best interest to, uh... Take a break?
Go to break, but in the meantime, why don't you, uh, give your Bitmoney experience of the week?
My Bitmoney experience of... I PASSED A CATA, DAMMIT!
Yes, I did, finally, it's a real one, it's actual, it's not like burning the floor, which is like a fake cata, you know...
This one's actually Kakumei.
Burning the Floor is a 7.
It just jumped up to a kata.
You know it's not a kata.
We know it's not a kata.
But damn it, Kakumei shouldn't be a kata, but is a kata.
Alright, well, we're going to break right now.
Even though Rob has now finished peeing.
Too bad, it's my turn and we're going to break.
I believe Executive Decision is coming to play.
We'll be back after these.
This song or so.
What are we playing now?
This potty break is brought to you by Propel Water.
Fitness water from Gatorade.
Yeah, whatever.
It's time to scream it!
It's time to scream it!
It's time to scream it!
Put it on!
Put it on!
Come on!
Get it!
Come on!
Get it!
Keep on pushing harder!
Put it on!
Put it on!
Thanks for watching!

DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we trouble people finger-bush?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Babani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
I say we let him go!
No!
Welcome back.
We're still here.
Hi, I'm back.
We've got pee-pee.
My bladder is empty, thank you.
Thank you for taking over the show there.
Now I know I can take a week off and leave the show in good hands.
We'll just have you in here.
We've got some fans in the chatroom who are sick of our old promos, who are threatening to make new ones.
Go for it.
We'd love to hear some fan-made promos.
I think that would be funny.
I just question, you know, if you're a fan of the show, let's get your voice on the station somehow.
It's everybody's show.
We want everybody to be a part of this show.
We don't have the call-in capabilities yet.
There's a party on our show and everyone's coming.
That's something we're looking for for the future is hopefully we can get some phone calls into the show.
But unfortunately that takes a kind of complex...
I don't know how that would go.
DarkSakura.com
Okay, the original version of Gentle Stress.
From 2DX, or... Yes, that's in our playlist.
Okay, then the AMD Sexual mix of Gentle Stress.
Give the mic back to Jamie now, please.
Wrong!
You win absolutely nothing!
Good suggestion from the chatroom, would an AOL Instant Messenger talk work?
I think actually it would, but not very well.
So I'm not sure if I want to try that just yet.
You might want to test it out with Yahoo Chat because you can't have multiple people.
Sometimes we do tests late at night when you guys aren't expecting it and we'll go live suddenly.
And pretty soon Jamie's going to be doing her own just spur-of-the-moment live shows.
Yep, I've been planning on playing non-stops in J-Rock.
I was going to say that Tech TV uses some sort of program for webcasting or something like that.
You might check in and see if they use the same program, see what they use.
You know, we need to get this show on television.
What do you guys think?
Yeah.
Let's write those people a letter to Tech TV.
What's that new station, G4 or whatever, all about video game talk?
Maybe.
Do you think Konami would ever let us do this show on there, though?
I have no idea if Konami even knows we exist.
I would doubt it.
But I would think, though, that if we did maybe something about all music games, which we pretty much do anyway.
We talk about all sorts of music games on the show.
We're all-encompassing.
It just happens to be Bomania's game right now.
When was the last time you talked about Pump It Up?
Well, let's talk about Pump It Up right now.
They have it at the Folsom Game Room.
What?
Not at Folsom Game Room.
Why did I say that?
I'm thinking of, you know, out in the boonies.
Are there any Pump It Up in Sacramento?
There's Florin Mall.
Really?
Where the hell is Florin Mall?
In the Tilt.
In the Ghetto Gate.
Yay.
Now, Florin Mall is in the Ghetto.
I was just there yesterday to get my booba.
Now, see, Pump It Up is a cool game that doesn't get much respect from people because it sucks.
And does it suck?
Well, I mean, it hurts to play.
You have to pound those damn keys.
Not really.
Okay, every Pump It Up machine I've played, you've had to pound all the keys.
Especially with their gimpy freeze arrows and that whole five arrow pad.
You know, it's almost like the Simpsons and Springfield and Shelbyville.
You know, everything that Pump It Up is is like utterly foreign and wrong in every way, shape, and form.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
However, I don't know.
I just can't get as obsessive with it as I do with DDR.
I couldn't sit here for two hours and talk about it.
Well, of course, we're having a hard time as it is sitting here for two hours talking about DDR.
But Pump It Up, I don't know.
It's just... It's not the same.
It's not the same.
Well, what if they got rid of, say, I don't know, the Sumo and put in a Pump It Up machine?
I would play it.
It's just like...
To me, it's like Guitar Freaks.
I'm never going to be that good at it, and I'm not going to play it a whole hell of a lot, but it's fun to do once in a while.
Just don't leave it next to the Parapara machine.
Oh, that would suck.
But now, having a pump-it-up machine would be a good idea at RBGL, mainly because it's just, it's good to have, you know, change.
That's why I sat down and learned to play Drum Mania, that's why I learned to play Keyboard Mania, because it sucks to sit there and freaking wait ten years for your turn at DDR Max, because no one in their right mind is going to play USA, I mean, let's be real here.
Um...
But playing Pump It Up is at least, like, that's why I like San Jose Golf Club.
I can go play Pump It Up, I can go play Max, play Soul Calibur 2, and go back and forth between the three, right?
Well, you know what my secret hope was for the longest time is that they would take the neat cabinet with the widescreen monitor like Pump It Up has and do a DDR with that kind of setup.
Or like the HD monitors like 2DX has and have something look good, although it'd burn out and no one would ever want to replace it.
One other game they were bringing up in the chatroom a lot here is Technomotion, which I don't know much about, but apparently there is one up the road a little ways in Nevada.
I believe it's an 8 or 9 panel DDR.
9 panel DDR?
That's gotta be interesting, but I hear the song selection really, really, really, really sucks.
At least Pump has some cool songs in it, but... Yes, ma'am?
I think actually they have a website you can check out.
During the game, I believe you can switch between 4, 5, or 8 panel.
Unfortunately, there's no 9 panel.
But you can play that, and I think they've got some A-list stuff, like, well, one-hit wonder stuff, like, you know, Mambo No.
5, and I think Livin' La Vida Local, and that kind of crap.
Just to intervene, though, Mambo No.
5 on Mambo Will Go Go?
Fuckin' rules.
Oh, by the way, Rob, I was reading my EGM yesterday, and I saw something that I know you're going to love this, dude.
You remember that tambourine game you played at AI, Shakota Tambourine?
It's coming to home version.
That tambourine thing is by far and wide the gayest game I have ever played in my life, is that tambourine game.
Which is why I immediately thought of you when I saw it.
Stevie Nicks impersonation.
That is all I could do when I'm playing that game.
I'm just like, you know, like, Rhiannon.
And she's like shaking this tambourine.
And that doesn't date Rob.
I'm not that old, dammit.
I'm old compared to you, but I'm not, well, not you, but you is in the chatroom, people.
But Jamie and I are the elders of the Sakmavani group, I know.
Bite your tongue.
Oh yeah, that's right, Bradley's... We're like the... He's Grandpa!
We're like the den parents or something, I don't know.
Isn't that what you had in... Damn ornery kids.
Isn't that what you had in Cub Scouts, was the den mother and the den father?
We would have got away for it too if it wasn't for those pesky kids.
I don't know if I want to compare this group to Cub Scouts, but anyway.
We're not like the Cub Scouts.
But seriously, Shikoto Tambourine has got to be... Rob is right.
It is freaking fruity as hell.
You have to pose with that goddamn thing.
Win it in circles and shit.
Samba de Amigo.
But Samba's kind of cool.
You have to do the crotch pose when they're both...
Watch this.
Watch this.
My favorite part is when it shows you, like, the little pattern, and you have to, like, shake it in a U pattern, like, around.
It's like, ooh, we're going around the world with a tambourine.
It's...
They're making it for the home, though, don't you think?
No, it actually, I believe it comes out this month for PlayStation 2.
There's already a tambourine game called Tam Tam Paradise.
Yeah, but this is the actual one, though, that AI, it's Shakoto.
It's coming, and I believe it comes with a tambourine thing, and you actually do have to shake it in a weird fucked up pattern, and it's a really retarded looking game, honest to God.
It's funny, you know what though, it does have a little bit of connection to Bomani because one of my favorite Bomani songs, My Sweet Darling, for Max is in that tambourine game.
I know because that was the only song I played because I failed it!
Yay!
You want to know what game pisses me off though?
Actually, you know, I don't ever recall hearing a tambourine playing in the background of my seat.
You're done.
You know what game really pisses me off is Kraken DJ.
The one chance I actually sat down to play Kraken, well I more like stood up to play Kraken DJ was last November at AI and I absolutely failed it.
But I saw this guy at Anime Expo.
I go in, I'm still in costume, like in these 4-inch platforms for my Mad Hatter costume.
And there was this guy doing all this expert stuff on the Kraken DJ.
And my god, I was more impressed with that than I am at most 2DX players.
Because that just takes some speed there.
Just to scratch like that and hit the little trigger in the center.
That was freaking awesome.
Crackin' DJ is a very cool game.
I've played it and I enjoy it a lot.
There's not very many stages.
I was kind of hoping they'd do a Crackin' DJ Part 2.
There's one.
Is there?
That was the one that was at AX, if I recall correctly.
My bad.
I stand corrected.
Other Bomani, not Bomani games, but they're like Bomani, that they're talking about at the chat room.
The grandpa, possibly, of Bomani games, Parappa the Rapper.
Kick Punch, it's all in the rhyme.
My guitar is in my mind!
I'm sorry, the baby stage ruled.
And actually, the baby stage... The baby stage used to be in... I'm so excited, I threw my pen.
The baby stage used to be in Rotation Orange Lounge.
I think we took it out recently, though.
We try not to let that stuff go to death.
But we do have a Parappa stage in Rotation.
We're going to have some Parappa 2 music coming very soon.
Now, the cool part of Unjammer Lammy was when you got to play through the stages of Parappa, and you got to sit and listen to the remixes of the various songs.
But I don't think Parappa 2 had very good music at all, really.
I disagree because the Toasty Burger song was very cool.
We're actually going to hear that in the next break.
The best, though, was Sister Miss Asia.
I do not have the game Parappa 2, but I have the music.
I obtained the music through a special source.
Hook a brother up, yo.
We'll see.
We'll see what kind of a mic or you are the rest of the show.
Yeah.
Hey, I left for a little while there.
That was plenty of time for you, don't you think?
Anyway...
Another one of my personal favorite music games, Vibriven.
I love Vibriven.
It's so cool.
I don't know what else to say.
Vibriven is just the bomb.
We're going to play that during the next break.
We'll play a song from Vibriven for you.
You want to play a little bit right now?
I'll let you get turned up a little.
Yes, I have Vibriven.
Oh, I don't know.
I was done.
Vibriven's just cool.
That's all.
I'm sorry, the little rabbit is on crack.
If you want to have fun, you play Vibraban to a non-stop.
That's insane.
I sat down and I turned a non-stop into one track, right?
I burned it onto a CD, and I played Vibraban to, I think, the max non-stop.
It's the hardest goddamn thing I think I've ever done.
The announcer just screws up the game every time he talks.
Vib-Ribbon
And so you've got, like, playing Max 300 is just ass.
It's absolutely horrible.
Since the hosts seem to be busy, I'm just going to keep talking here for a second.
No, bad idea.
Well, you know, one thing that surprised me on Vibravin when we put in, this was before Max 2, we put in Max 300, and we thought it was going to be evil, but So Deep was worse.
So Deep was evil on Vibravin.
You know, there's a bunch of other music games, though, there's Samba de Amigo, I mean, what other game can you play the Burning Rangers theme song to, or the Opa Opa song from Fantasy Zone?
You know, that was awesome.
You know, I know that Samba de Amigo is sitting in the next room over, but I have yet to ever even see that game.
We will do a Samba Fest after the show, but I do have to throw everyone out pretty soon after the show because I have to drive over to the bay tonight.
And then there's, of course, the greatest game ever, Rez, which is just amazing techno music with a really gimpy shooter attached to it.
And, I don't know, Frequency, I heard that was a music game.
I've never actually played that one.
Frequency looks pretty cool.
Frequency's very cool.
I've played Frequency.
It's cool.
Space Channel 5 Part 2 is a very nice sequel.
It goes there.
Space Channel 5 Part 2 just takes everything that the first game went there with and then shoots past it by a few miles.
Pudding!
I love Pudding.
You know, the best thing was, you know, not many people like Puyo Da.
I love Puyo Da.
It was basically the Puyo Puyo dancing game.
Which we talked about earlier in the show, yes.
People don't like the music in it, but I absolutely love the music.
Some of it's very cool, I remember.
Cheesy J-pop, it's cool.
Cheesy fun.
Hmm, any other not-Bomani games we can think of?
Yes.
There's a pretty fun one on Saturn that's basically a Parappa clone called Jong Rhythm.
I saw there was a post on it on DDR Freak.
I wanted to respond to it, but never got to.
It's a fun, it's like a Parappa clone.
It basically is a Parappa clone.
You follow along, your teacher tells you something, and then you follow along.
That's really good music, too.
I wish I could find an album of it, because the last, the sixth stage song is really awesome.
Too bad, I need a perfect, I want to find a perfect version, because it's a really good song.
I wonder if it's on the internet somewhere.
That's not the game that's all audio, is it?
Because there was a Saturn game that I saw in San Francisco that has absolutely no graphics, it's all audio.
It's like the real sound game, something like that.
I think that's it.
And, like, you get seeds with it.
Now, how about the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video?
I know a place where you can get that in town.
I was looking at Sean Baby today because I was quite possibly bored out of my mind, and he was describing the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video thing, and it seems like the most retarded game ever known to man.
I mean, honest to God, that thing looks awful.
I got to play for a little, little bit once the C&C Music Factory Make Your Own Music Video game.
Oh, God.
I would love to be able to play that again.
Just like, you know, ten years later.
That would be awesome to play that.
God, dude, I can't even remember them.
They were so... That sounded like 1994 or something.
How can you forget C&C Music Factory?
You know what game was absolute ass though?
I actually did rent the Shice Girls game.
Shiza?
The Spice Girls game.
Oh, oh yes, I'm sorry, yes.
I have the... Dude, I have Spice World in the other room.
Don't get me started.
Anyway... I thought we've already covered the fact that you're gay.
Shut up!
The game was very, very much ass.
You know, I never played the MTV Music Generator games, although I heard that they were pretty neat.
Yeah, they're alright.
I got the computer one.
Now, if we want to talk about ass, we'll talk about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Magical Mall.
Anyway, that's not a music game.
The king of the top of those, though, will always be the Bust a Move series.
And I'm not meaning Puzzle Bobble.
I mean Bust a Move.
That's one of Jamie's pet peeves.
You're not allowed to refer to it as Bust a Groove.
Funny, I like Bust a Groove quite a bit.
You die!
You die!
Ow.
Now, this is interesting.
You play Spice World but deny Britney?
There's a difference between playing cheesy and then just looking at a slut.
There's a difference between five sluts and one slut, okay?
No, I'm sorry.
Four sluts and Mel C. What?
You mean they're not drag queens?
I'm not so sure about Ginger, but hey.
No, she said it herself.
She didn't want to be with the group because she didn't want to look like a drag queen.
and now she can be found.
It's Reign of Men in Max 2.
I guess we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
So in this break I'm going to play a couple songs from games that we've been referencing.
We'll start it off with a song from Pump It Up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That's right, I'm in the house, here it comes, the extra, extra, feed all about it, the best burgers in town from all around, from around the world, come and get it, the line goes around like a merry-go-round, cause, uh-uh-uh, yes, you gotta, you gotta keep it.
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
I'll cook the patties Cook the patties Serve the drinks Serve the drinks And melt the cheese Melt the cheese French the fries French the fries
On the right, guys, we got no extra.
You watch the grill, control the flame, guys.
Follow through, stay productive, and guys, cook those burgers.
Cook those burgers.
Turn the party over.
Turn the party over.
Come on and watch them fries.
I'm not speaking.
Watch them fries.
Better execute than not.
Better.
Don't forget the cheese, don't forget the cheese Bring on the mustard, bring on the mustard Handle it with ease, handle it with ease Burgers, burgers, it's only half of mine We cook the best, best is in line Love with a dumb embrace, it's for you to know Any which way it tastes good, you know Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut the lettuce, don't forget the cheese
Yeah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.
Now go serve those burgers right now.
All right, I'm off to a good start.
Thanks for watching!
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
Yes, thank you Mel B. Give me a dollar.
Mel B. was here in the house a couple weeks ago.
It was a good show.
And Melody was here too.
Melody was here too, and hopefully they're going to be back.
We don't know when, but hopefully soon.
Vibraman
It's one of the original tracks that was on Viberbin.
I'm not sure if I actually have the file labeled right.
It is called Laughin' Beats.
Yes.
So, I don't know if that was the first or second stage or what, but whatever.
It's one of the original tracks from Viberbin.
Yes, very cool.
And a lot of people in the chatroom going, oh, that would be a very interesting song in DDR.
There'd be a lot of BPM changes they could...
Tempo changer out the ass.
Now, Loki sat here and did a Vibraban song on his sim, and it's got some absolutely ridiculous freaking tempo changes in there.
I'd like to correct Tal there.
I did not do that song.
I believe... I can't even remember who did it.
It was back... It was a BMS file somewhere.
And the same people did another Vib Ribbon song.
I believe it was... I don't even remember what it was called now.
Love and Peace or something like that.
Anyways, and the same people did this other song...
I can't remember what it was.
It was really awesome, though.
I think they also did, uh, what was it?
Just a little bit, whatever that song is.
Um, yeah, so, it wasn't me.
I don't really make that many songs.
But yeah, still, though, this thing sped up, slowed down at re- I mean, it does that in the game, too.
It really, really fucks with you.
I mean, the game will speed up and slow down.
I mean, it'll go with the song, but it'll still, you're not expecting it, and you guys need to play this game.
It's so good.
I can't wait till Mojiburbin comes out.
It's actually been re-released for, uh, the first one, though, has been re-released, I think, for PlayStation the Best, hasn't it?
Yes.
To my knowledge, yes.
Although, I have a nice original copy.
Yeah, I have an original copy, too.
Because piracy is bad.
Well, the original, though, isn't the best case.
It's backwards.
Yeah, but it's not that piracy is bad so much that we couldn't figure out for the lifeless how to copy the damn game.
And so, it only cost, I believe, 15 bucks off of NCSX.
So I went and bought it, like, that night.
Actually, all you gotta do is you load it up in Nero.
Anyway, um... You got it for 15 from NCSX?
They must have dropped the price.
When I bought mine, I bought mine for $40.
Wow.
I think it's $30 right now.
It wasn't $15.
I got it for $30.
I'm sorry.
Liar.
I paid $40 for mine.
A couple other topics before we close out the show.
Another road trip to Lodi How many animals did I walk out of there with?
Nine?
I had to get a bag.
So yeah, we might take this road on the show in the future.
Something they were talking about in the chat room earlier, I'm not sure if we've touched on this subject in an earlier show.
I seem to recall we might have discussed it, but favorite drink when playing Bomani games?
Have we talked about this?
Pocari Sweat.
Oh yeah, we did do this a couple weeks ago.
Although there are some new drinks out.
This Pepsi Blue, what do you think of that?
Has anybody had Pepsi Blue?
I have something like five or six bottles of Pepsi Blue in my fridge.
That stuff is...
Really, really good, but you can't really drink it.
You can't pound down a six-pack of it because you'll die of diabetes or something.
It looks like Windex, and it kind of tastes like strawberry soda and cotton candy.
I think it's the only way I can describe Pepsi Blue.
It's kind of a hybrid of the two of those.
I thought the fun of cotton candy was having it be dissolving and fluffy.
Crystal Pepsi was the shit.
I remember marching in Mardi Gras.
and Mobile.
Okay, everybody, I'm from the town that Mardi Gras originated in.
How many beads did you win that night?
Oh, God.
Cid Freak can just give them to us after the parade, but I digress.
They pulled out cases of Crystal Pepsi and said, they don't make this anymore, they gave it to us for free, drink it up.
Looks like Windex, tastes like you're sucking on Clorox wipes
Now, I take issue with that comment.
I mean, oh my god, Jamie's hawking up over here.
But no, I take issue with that comment.
I mean, it's a good soda.
It's just too sweet.
Drink one a day or something, maybe at most, you know.
But I like to do it, I mix it with my Indian green soda so it looks like this cool blue-green stuff and it tastes really sweet, but...
The ultra-saccharine nature of Pepsi Blue is a bit cut down a bit, and it tastes a whole lot better.
What about the people who are addicted to Ghetto Kool-Aid?
Do you think they'll have a problem with it?
No.
Because it does kind of taste like Ghetto Kool-Aid.
Pepsi Blue's kind of carbonated Ghetto Kool-Aid.
Although, I will say, though, out of all the new drinks out on the market, the winner is Vanilla Coke.
Vanilla Coke.
I utterly disagree, but that's because I've just never liked vanilla in Coke.
And you're just an ass, so... Just kidding.
We love Todd.
He is one big butt.
I can't believe that SoCalKick hasn't heard of Pepsi Crystal.
Where the hell have you been for the past ten years, bro?
Crystal Pepsi was on it.
When was Crystal Pepsi's out?
That's it.
I'm probably not going to use it, but I'm making a banner with a Crystal Pepsi can on it.
Crystal Pepsi era of growth was from something like 1993 up until about 1995 before it died.
Oh, we have a follow-up comment.
Hey, are you dissing Clorox wipes?
Have you even tried sucking on them?
Mmm, creamy Clorox goodness.
I've never heard Clorox described as creamy.
Your poo will smell lemon fresh.
No, we are not having any mint scattles reference.
But now we have, like, lemon scattles.
Feel the mint taste as rainbow.
Now, Coke, too, on the other hand, was the biggest pile of ass ever.
They still sell that in Britain.
New Coke is huge in Britain.
But then again, in Britain, you can also go into Burger King and buy a bean burger, okay?
So, they have no fucking taste.
Wasn't that just a tofu burger?
No, this is a burger.
It's got, like, you take fucking Taco Bell beans or something, and you lump it in between two buns with cheese and lettuce and all that shit.
It's called a bean burger.
It's a vegetarian thing.
Now, being the token vegetarian, I went and had one at the airport.
And, oh my god, I was crying for a goddamn tofu burger.
And I hate tofu.
They're so crazy.
Who will they think of next?
It's Marshall Beat!
We know that Frequency is online, but we also know that VibRibbon's sequel, Mojibribbon's online, which is really cool in that you take text files, run it through, and the little rabbit turns it into a custom-made rap.
It's like we used to do with our old voice reader things back in the old days of Windows 3.1 and shit, where you'd have the weird, funky voice read your little text messages.
I am the computer.
I'm going to say, Fook.
Fook you.
You look like shite.
There was the DOS program that was, this is my favorite one.
I was, I think in 8th grade, the psychologist.
and Dr. Sabato.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
I don't know if any of you ever saw that, but I do have a memory of that.
The Crystal Gravy was so funny.
Anyway, I guess you had to be there.
You know, that was back in the high period of Saturday Night Live, 93 to 94.
Back when I was like 12 or something.
Dude, I drank a gallon of Crystal Pepsi a day during school years, I think.
I started my senior year of high school in 93.
Don't make me feel bad.
We'll talk more about online games and all that stuff next week.
We will.
93?
I was in freaking 7th grade.
I graduated in 94.
No, 6th or 7th grade is when I got into 93.
Damn, you're old.
Bite my ass.
And on that note, I think we're going to end the show.
Any final notes other than fuck Tal?
What?
Yes, but fuck you next week.
Where's my music?
Oh, hold on.
We've got to find your music.
We played a lot of music tonight in the middle of the show.
I've got to find your music.
Here we go, I got it.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you.
Well put, thank you.
All right, we're ending the show now.
Any final thoughts from the lovely Miss DarkSakura?
I'm a mic whore.
You are.
Yes, you are.
Anything you'd like to say, Matt?
No.
All right, Bradley?
Nope, it is.
On behalf of everybody here in the studio tonight, goodnight.
Whatever.
Listen to our Bomani Music and More program because we want to whore up our ratings and that's the best way to do it is when we have listeners.
So listen to us all the time.
When you're sleeping, just leave it on and let the music fill your dreams.
Oh God, I feel sorry.
You'll be dreaming about everything from... Let Orange Lounge violate you.
Dancing Pompokolin to Pachinko Love and Fear Factory is there.
Alright, the end.
Goodnight.
And next week we'll have our Kutimu impression.
I'll let go of it!
Shut up, Shiva.
Microphone whore.
Bye.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Well, son, a funny thing about regret is that it's better to regret something you have done than to regret something you haven't done.
And by the way, if you see your mom this weekend, be sure and tell her... Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
