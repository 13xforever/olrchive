00:51.647 --> 00:52.367
[SPEAKER_11]: 212, fuck you!

00:52.387 --> 00:53.868
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no morals, darling.

00:53.968 --> 00:58.310
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching kiss of purpose.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.631

01:36.642 --> 01:38.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:38.864 --> 01:43.509
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things B-E-Mani.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.052
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:46.532 --> 01:50.617
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say B-E-Mani because I get criticized when I don't say B-E-Mani like the announcer did.

01:50.637 --> 01:51.357
[SPEAKER_08]: B-E-Mani.

01:51.397 --> 01:51.858
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.622
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll get criticized if I don't say B-E-Mani.

01:55.762 --> 01:56.563
[SPEAKER_08]: But poopy on that.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.384
[SPEAKER_08]: Poopy, poopy, poopy.

01:58.974 --> 02:02.339
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, joining me as always, the lovely Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

02:02.359 --> 02:03.181
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't say that.

02:03.201 --> 02:03.601
[SPEAKER_08]: You just said it.

02:03.621 --> 02:04.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm saying it.

02:04.363 --> 02:06.145
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it the past eight weeks in a row.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.281
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing today, Jamie?

02:09.681 --> 02:10.421
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm fucking tired.

02:10.821 --> 02:11.522
[SPEAKER_08]: I can imagine.

02:11.562 --> 02:12.762
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hear why very soon.

02:13.182 --> 02:16.484
[SPEAKER_08]: This is episode number 9 for August 18th of 2002.

02:16.944 --> 02:23.107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we've probably got a lot of new listeners tonight tuning in for the coverage of the Dollar Mendy Tournament.

02:23.688 --> 02:27.930

[SPEAKER_08]: No, I haven't.

03:07.114 --> 03:08.334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very proud of you.

[SPEAKER_08]: You get a gold star for attendance.

03:10.235 --> 03:11.475
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to get the sticker page.

03:11.996 --> 03:15.717
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

03:16.277 --> 03:22.220
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that break, we're going to have an original version of a famous DDR song, which I'm sure you're all going to enjoy.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Come join our chat room on any other side IRC server.

03:26.795 --> 03:29.659

[SPEAKER_08]: No Britney.

03:31.462 --> 03:32.543
[SPEAKER_08]: But we could get Petite Love.

04:03.355 --> 04:08.682
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just a little bit of an adult, but I want you to notice me.

04:08.702 --> 04:10.524
My beloved mama, my darling.

04:10.604 --> 04:14.068
I'm just a little bit of an adult, but I want you to notice me.

04:29.013 --> 04:30.074
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

04:59.537 --> 05:00.558
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

05:32.961 --> 05:36.004

05:36.064 --> 05:39.426
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll send you an email, even if it's just a little.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.088

08:03.214 --> 08:04.637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

09:58.587 --> 09:59.372
Thanks for watching!

11:11.107 --> 11:16.950
[SPEAKER_29]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

11:21.773 --> 11:25.455
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Real Radio makes Jamie cry, too.

11:29.943 --> 11:34.064
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom demanded more promos last week, so we got some together for this week.

11:34.104 --> 11:34.744
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few, though.

11:34.764 --> 11:38.465
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a special one, just because you guys bitched.

11:40.165 --> 11:43.926
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anyway, and now they're bitching in chatroom.

11:43.946 --> 11:47.167
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to have to make a new one for them, because they're not capable, apparently.

11:47.867 --> 11:48.587
[SPEAKER_17]: Chocotola Chocotola Chocotola

12:16.098 --> 12:17.760
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to KTMI Radio.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.220
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

12:18.280 --> 12:18.801
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kidding.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.424
[SPEAKER_08]: If you really believe that, honestly, you think DDR is that great?

12:21.444 --> 12:23.145
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob has to let himself go.

12:23.386 --> 12:24.006
[SPEAKER_18]: Flotation.

12:26.778 --> 12:27.959
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a microphone whore

12:50.362 --> 12:50.943
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Trunks Owned You Board

13:11.594 --> 13:15.939
[SPEAKER_08]: When did Captain Jack do a remix to Take Me Out to the Ball Game?

13:30.629 --> 13:37.511
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I remember, there's a Dance Mania Sports album that's out now, and that's when the song's on.

13:37.671 --> 13:42.592
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we didn't get the Baja Man with Who Let the Dogs Out, which was also on that CD.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.233
[SPEAKER_05]: That song would have been cool for DDR.

13:46.733 --> 13:48.433
[SPEAKER_08]: You are in the minority, sir.

13:49.473 --> 13:56.215
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm disappointed is, 9-1-1, I love their Friday Night song, but more than a woman, Friday Night rocks it.

13:57.428 --> 14:03.210
[SPEAKER_08]: One interesting entry I see here, Eiffel 65 with Blue is on this list.

14:03.731 --> 14:07.032
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one that should have been in DDR maybe three years ago.

14:07.052 --> 14:08.152
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead and read off the list.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm going to read off what I can here.

14:09.913 --> 14:16.736
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Never End by Yoma Komowatsu, Midnight Town by the Divas, Secret Rendezvous, Baby Give Me Love, those songs.

14:17.376 --> 14:21.558
[SPEAKER_08]: Red the Fire by Scotty D, who I don't think has done anything since Drop the Bomb, correct?

14:21.578 --> 14:21.618
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

14:21.858 --> 14:23.999
[SPEAKER_18]: No, he did something on 2DX.

14:24.899 --> 14:26.620
[SPEAKER_08]: He did the track with Megu, Stick Around.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.561
[SPEAKER_08]: Celtic Music, Revenge vs. Desire.

14:31.221 --> 14:33.742
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be very cool, as long as it doesn't sound like Enya.

14:33.802 --> 14:37.383
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Enya facilitates foul movement.

14:37.903 --> 14:39.304
[SPEAKER_08]: As we've said on other shows.

14:40.764 --> 14:44.946
[SPEAKER_08]: B4U, of course, returns, hooray, with a song called Crazy Sound.

14:45.866 --> 14:46.987
[SPEAKER_08]: Max the XXXium Love to...

15:08.980 --> 15:11.261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one song that was in Euromix too.

15:11.281 --> 15:12.202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it's called.

15:12.242 --> 15:12.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Something.

15:13.502 --> 15:15.523
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

15:15.543 --> 15:16.063
[SPEAKER_08]: 321 Stars.

15:17.144 --> 15:18.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally in DDR.

15:18.204 --> 15:18.425
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

15:18.485 --> 15:21.986
[SPEAKER_08]: If this list is true, we got the 321 Stars in there.

15:22.006 --> 15:22.747
[SPEAKER_08]: That would so work.

15:24.447 --> 15:33.532
[SPEAKER_08]: Colors, Glorious Days, A, L'Amour et Libre, Kiss Kiss Kiss, and Mobomoga.

15:35.312 --> 15:36.393
[SPEAKER_18]: You could just say Love and Liberty.

15:38.133 --> 16:03.145
[SPEAKER_08]: Lavo and La Liberté, Extreme, Masa Kenada, and then a bunch of other songs here, Bus Stop, Owner of a Lonely Heart, Venus, Sunshine in Our Music, New York City Boy, What's Up 2000 by DJ Miko, New York City Boy by Pet Shop Boys, not the 2DX4th version, that's the original, and then Nancy and the Boys with SOS, I wonder if that's the same Dr. Bombay SOS, or if we're talking like ABBA SOS, or what?

16:03.165 --> 16:04.646
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's ABBA SOS, that would be cool.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.353
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Chaos with Sweet Desire and DJ Magical with Rush Hour

16:27.955 --> 16:28.556
[SPEAKER_08]: by Sigma.

16:28.816 --> 16:29.156
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

16:29.216 --> 16:30.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, Max Infinity sounds better.

16:30.797 --> 16:33.800
[SPEAKER_04]: Max XXM is really retarded.

16:34.000 --> 16:34.260
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

16:35.321 --> 16:36.682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Porno Max.

16:36.742 --> 16:37.923
[SPEAKER_17]: It rides the short bus.

16:38.523 --> 16:41.826
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the promo for the new movie with Vin Diesel or something.

16:42.646 --> 16:43.167
[SPEAKER_17]: God, no.

16:45.191 --> 16:46.031
[SPEAKER_08]: Possible Max 3 Song List

17:04.461 --> 17:09.983
[SPEAKER_08]: in Max 3, and I've got one of those songs that was just sent to me, and I haven't even pulled this up myself to listen to it.

17:10.323 --> 17:14.304
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm told the quality isn't the best, but we'll play a little bit of it for you here.

17:14.744 --> 17:16.565
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's pretty good quality, we'll even play the whole thing.

17:16.585 --> 17:18.505
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's kind of crappy quality, we won't play very much.

17:18.846 --> 17:19.506
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's listen to it.

17:19.546 --> 17:22.987
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Naoki featuring Politary with Memories.

17:23.847 --> 17:24.627
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

17:25.868 --> 17:27.928
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you ready?

17:27.948 --> 17:28.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go!

17:28.308 --> 17:29.289
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm keeping the mics on for this.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.109
[SPEAKER_18]: No fucking Politary, please.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.130
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so far I'm digging it.

17:34.469 --> 17:39.571
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, it's Destiny all over again.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.711
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't that woman hold a key?

17:57.316 --> 18:00.518
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to, her voice is pretty good in this, so it's not as annoying as mine.

18:00.638 --> 18:02.118
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they've read it through a mixer.

18:02.238 --> 18:03.519
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to let you go.

18:03.679 --> 18:04.820
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want you to know.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.800
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear the change?

18:06.921 --> 18:07.461
[SPEAKER_18]: The one I love.

18:07.481 --> 18:08.081
[SPEAKER_18]: The one I love.

18:26.507 --> 18:29.971
[SPEAKER_17]: Super Performance!

[SPEAKER_17]: That's a new one for your music.

18:31.493 --> 18:32.514
[SPEAKER_17]: Super Performance!

18:33.695 --> 18:35.197
[SPEAKER_15]: You all take that back!

18:35.758 --> 18:37.099
[SPEAKER_15]: You are making that back!

18:37.159 --> 18:38.100
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to stop you!

18:38.120 --> 18:38.661
[SPEAKER_15]: We could!

18:50.663 --> 18:53.106
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want you to know I just want you to be mine

19:09.750 --> 19:15.813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Naoki Just like any other Naoki song is what I was saying Yeah, it doesn't sound that bad compared to half the other stuff

19:35.325 --> 19:36.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Performa!

20:06.115 --> 20:09.197
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get to the first part of those interviews, shall we?

20:09.497 --> 20:12.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear some of the interviews from DollarMendy's tournament.

20:12.318 --> 20:13.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's talk about it, because some of you guys went.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.601
[SPEAKER_08]: I, unfortunately, I really wanted to go to this tournament, but I did have some... Somebody went to QZAR.

20:17.861 --> 20:20.063
[SPEAKER_08]: I had some previous commitments that I had to do.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody went to QZAR.

20:21.123 --> 20:21.904
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't get to go.

20:22.004 --> 20:22.504
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's hear it.

20:22.564 --> 20:22.984
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me.

20:23.525 --> 20:24.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

20:24.245 --> 20:29.268
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki had to go run off to QZAR with Paul over his stupid... He's like, oh, PA is boring.

20:29.288 --> 20:30.148
[SPEAKER_18]: We were loyal.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.329
[SPEAKER_18]: We raped the crane machine.

20:31.549 --> 20:32.810
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me and...

20:35.174 --> 20:37.796
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, sorry, I forgot your name for a second.

20:38.316 --> 20:38.837
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

20:38.957 --> 20:39.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out!

20:39.597 --> 20:40.057
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm old!

20:40.258 --> 20:40.618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm old.

20:41.618 --> 20:43.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, in my own special way.

20:43.540 --> 20:47.322
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I won like 15 prizes off that game, and I don't know how many she won.

20:47.402 --> 20:48.103
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch.

20:48.603 --> 20:49.964
[SPEAKER_18]: I was giving them away all day.

20:50.364 --> 21:00.031
[SPEAKER_05]: But PA got kind of boring because since it was on doubles, everything went twice as slow, and giving everyone a qualifying practice round made it

21:00.663 --> 21:04.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Even longer and more boring, but I made it through the qualifying round.

21:04.387 --> 21:08.632
[SPEAKER_18]: It got pretty intense once they started running through those homemade Oni courses, though.

21:09.313 --> 21:10.274
[SPEAKER_18]: That was pretty insane.

21:10.954 --> 21:13.818
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, Akuzar... No!

21:13.978 --> 21:14.779
[SPEAKER_18]: No Akuzar!

21:16.832 --> 21:19.993
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun, but when I came back, the freestyle was cool.

21:20.993 --> 21:27.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, though, my favorite part of the tournament had to have been Ruben's little intermission stuff in between performers.

21:27.054 --> 21:27.774
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

21:28.115 --> 21:39.957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, after like 20 people did Spin the Disc, he did a Spin the Disc freestyle with his stop, drop, and roll move halfway through the song, which was one of the highlights along with Corey's headspin.

21:40.137 --> 21:42.060
[SPEAKER_18]: Corey's Headspin was the winner of the show.

21:42.201 --> 21:42.741
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

21:42.761 --> 21:48.210
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there were some really good routines, but I think I can get into... One of the judges gave him 100 and wrote, Oh my God, Headspin.

21:48.912 --> 21:49.633
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was their card.

21:50.299 --> 21:53.783
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave Ruben a negative 69 for his routine.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.245
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

21:56.445 --> 22:00.389
[SPEAKER_05]: But in PA, just throw out some who won stuff.

22:01.050 --> 22:03.573
[SPEAKER_05]: For PA, Jimmy came in first.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.275
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forget who came in second.

22:06.796 --> 22:09.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Emphasis, Jimmy came in first.

22:10.039 --> 22:11.521
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jazz came in third.

22:12.290 --> 22:12.790
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

22:12.810 --> 22:13.711
[SPEAKER_05]: Second was Radical.

22:14.711 --> 22:16.632
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the results right here.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.913
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'll give me a second to pull everything up.

22:20.093 --> 22:22.194
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, this is taken from DDR Freak.

22:22.214 --> 22:28.396
[SPEAKER_18]: For PA, first place, we have Emphasis, who I also noticed, I guess, is newly inducted into RTF.

22:29.236 --> 22:30.317
[SPEAKER_18]: So, congratulations.

22:31.037 --> 22:32.578
[SPEAKER_18]: Second place, Radical of Ass.

22:34.118 --> 22:37.479
[SPEAKER_18]: Third from Step Squad, we have Jass, Maneki Neko Jass.

22:37.819 --> 22:38.600
[SPEAKER_18]: Fourth, Flush Chubbs.

22:40.901 --> 22:48.825
[SPEAKER_18]: For group freestyle, first place was Hypnotix and One Wish Mike, or Boogaloo Shrimp, I guess, going by now.

22:48.926 --> 22:53.208
[SPEAKER_18]: Second was DK Angel Wings of Step Squad and Kid Hero.

22:53.308 --> 22:58.051
[SPEAKER_18]: Third place was Marky Mark and Tommy L. I'm just reading off the list, I'm sorry.

22:58.651 --> 23:06.756
[SPEAKER_18]: For comedy, first place we have Mr. Wendell and Fancy Lala, who's his niece, that was a very, very cute routine to Cowgirl.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.678
[SPEAKER_18]: and we have a single freestyle.

23:11.278 --> 23:25.105
[SPEAKER_18]: First was Fuzzy Hat, second was Mr. Wendell, third was Rain of RTF and fourth was DK Angel Wing's dad who got up there and just did some amazing last minute freestyle.

23:25.145 --> 23:26.485
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the coolest thing ever.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.426
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably the third coolest thing about the tournament.

23:28.446 --> 23:29.527
[SPEAKER_05]: He just got up and started like...

23:30.518 --> 23:33.061
[SPEAKER_05]: He was better than, like, almost everyone else.

23:33.101 --> 23:34.102
[SPEAKER_05]: And he made it up on the spot.

23:34.142 --> 23:34.723
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

23:35.083 --> 23:38.107
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, Fuzzy has the man because he had fire.

23:38.427 --> 23:40.830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he used candles for raving.

23:41.711 --> 23:45.335
[SPEAKER_18]: He did a really nice routine to healing vision.

23:45.875 --> 23:50.260
[SPEAKER_18]: And Wendell's was to center the heart, which I thought was very, very well presented.

23:50.380 --> 23:50.941
[SPEAKER_05]: Very funny.

23:51.817 --> 24:04.658
[SPEAKER_08]: of course I was a judge actually I was going to ask you Jamie as a judge for the tournament awesome, I'm glad you got to participate in that what did you think of the level of freestyle at this tournament compared to other tournaments you've either been to or heard about, seen videos of

24:05.365 --> 24:09.228
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that not everyone was really taking the tourney seriously.

24:09.468 --> 24:13.611
[SPEAKER_18]: However, it looked like people were having fun with what they were doing.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.614
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the biggest things that I like to judge on is energy.

24:18.215 --> 24:21.037
[SPEAKER_18]: The amount of enthusiasm you put into doing your performance.

24:21.737 --> 24:25.360
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to say there was a good bit of energy in the performances.

24:25.740 --> 24:29.383
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happens when everyone drinks like four pitchers of beer right before.

24:29.403 --> 24:39.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, and we have the other contest that was going on on the side, and that's the drinking contest between Step Squad and the members of RTF that were there.

24:39.710 --> 24:39.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

24:40.530 --> 24:48.556
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Mr. Windle drank a lot because he fell over halfway through his group comedy performance for Cowgirl, and that was pretty funny.

24:49.536 --> 25:04.225
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the drinking results in 7th place, we have Iguana Grove Step Squad, 6th place, Islander, 5th place, Fuzzy Hat, 4th place, Mr. Wendell, 3rd, Reign of RTF, 2nd place, Kiyoki, and 1st place, Jay Connecticut Step Squad.

25:05.165 --> 25:05.546
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool.

25:05.566 --> 25:12.109
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd also like to give a shout out to the newer members of Step Squad and to my Step Squad family.

25:13.830 --> 25:17.572
[SPEAKER_18]: Really, it was Step Squad all over the place at the tourney and it was a lot of fun.

25:19.229 --> 25:21.771
[SPEAKER_05]: How many beers did Jay Kinetic have?

25:21.931 --> 25:24.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know Rain had about nine.

25:24.694 --> 25:26.835
[SPEAKER_08]: All I have to say also is wait until we get to the interviews.

25:27.076 --> 25:31.039
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to see just how Step Squad was all over this journey, especially in the interviews.

25:34.222 --> 25:39.106
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, well, I know that there were many, many pitchers of beer floating around.

25:39.946 --> 25:45.211
[SPEAKER_18]: I do also know that, you know, apparently I'm some alcohol connoisseur because I sniffed it and could tell it was Heineken.

25:45.231 --> 25:45.891
[SPEAKER_18]: But...

25:48.493 --> 25:50.793
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a whole lot of drinking going on.

25:50.833 --> 25:56.614
[SPEAKER_18]: I was worried for a few people, and Kiyoki turned into the human billboard for the tournament.

25:57.875 --> 26:08.757
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I signed his head somewhere, and Corey signed his arm with 2DX Style, which I'll go ahead and give a plug for 2DXStyle.net.

26:09.657 --> 26:10.117
[SPEAKER_18]: Check it out.

26:10.877 --> 26:11.837
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a plug for us, too.

26:12.217 --> 26:14.458
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, very cool site.

26:14.638 --> 26:15.598
[SPEAKER_18]: It was basically...

26:16.727 --> 26:20.229
[SPEAKER_18]: There was the impromptu wrestling out in the parking lot.

26:20.889 --> 26:29.933
[SPEAKER_18]: We had Jay Kinetic putting Keshi in the walls of Jericho while I had to do a run-in with the orange bat of justice, trademark.

26:31.474 --> 26:35.596
[SPEAKER_18]: The bat did get signed by just about everybody, so it's now owned.

26:37.515 --> 26:38.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's go to the tape.

26:38.915 --> 26:39.555
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that sound?

26:40.095 --> 26:40.636
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like winter.

26:40.656 --> 26:44.976
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm going to leave the mics hot and we can pause these interviews as we feel the need to interject.

26:45.596 --> 26:46.477
[SPEAKER_18]: Sam, this is a hot mic.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.197
[SPEAKER_18]: Put my hands up.

26:47.577 --> 26:48.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

26:48.997 --> 26:53.838
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Jamie live at the Dollar Mendy Tournament, which was held just yesterday on August 17th.

26:53.898 --> 26:55.098
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, Rob, it's not live.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.159
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not live.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.439
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to play it live, though.

26:59.019 --> 26:59.379
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

26:59.419 --> 27:00.159
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Jamie live.

27:00.179 --> 27:01.039
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing a live tape.

27:01.259 --> 27:02.039
[SPEAKER_08]: I recorded it live.

27:02.119 --> 27:03.520
[SPEAKER_08]: When she recorded it, she was live.

27:04.160 --> 27:04.500
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

27:04.560 --> 27:04.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the tape.

27:05.755 --> 27:09.478
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, this is DarkSakura coming to you live from Mountain Mike's in Concord.

27:09.498 --> 27:10.799
[SPEAKER_18]: See, what'd I tell you?

27:10.819 --> 27:11.660
[SPEAKER_08]: She's coming to you live.

27:13.499 --> 27:13.799
[SPEAKER_18]: Bitch.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.041
[SPEAKER_18]: August 17th of 2002.

27:17.722 --> 27:23.746
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a series of interviews done here at the Dollar Mendy Summer Vacation Tournament for Orange Knowledge Radio.

27:24.446 --> 27:26.027
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you don't like it, too bad.

27:26.508 --> 27:29.510
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we are to our next segment of interviews for Orange Knowledge Radio.

27:29.550 --> 27:32.212
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that I don't have the pause button on the recorder.

27:32.312 --> 27:35.334
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's go to... I have to say it was Jamie's first time.

27:36.326 --> 27:39.567
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there was bound to be a few mistakes, and one of them was the pause button.

27:39.587 --> 27:54.254
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm upset, though, because one of the interviews I did, I started off with Naoki Ichidoji, who apparently we had been trying to meet for the Sakura Matsuri in San Francisco for years and years in a row, and we finally met up at tourneys, so it was cool.

27:54.474 --> 27:55.094
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's cool.

27:55.114 --> 27:56.195
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you guys.

27:56.735 --> 27:57.836
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, this is the very first.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.617
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do this more and more on Orange Lounge.

27:59.677 --> 28:02.599
[SPEAKER_08]: Go out throughout the Bomani community and tape things at events.

28:02.699 --> 28:04.760
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of the first in a series of those.

28:05.841 --> 28:07.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie did an excellent job with this.

28:07.622 --> 28:08.962
[SPEAKER_08]: My applause to her.

28:09.303 --> 28:10.043
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's listen to the rest.

28:10.323 --> 28:14.225
[SPEAKER_18]: To our current guests, go ahead and tell everyone who you are.

28:14.446 --> 28:15.126
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear our mic?

28:15.346 --> 28:15.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again.

28:17.247 --> 28:18.068
[SPEAKER_18]: The Cockmaster.

28:18.888 --> 28:20.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the Cockmaster.

28:22.665 --> 28:25.247
[SPEAKER_18]: and go ahead and let everyone know what you're doing for Trinity again.

28:26.468 --> 28:30.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Staff and Gumby has two inches of hot dick for you.

28:31.452 --> 28:32.973
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you like to answer this?

28:33.854 --> 28:34.955
[SPEAKER_18]: There's something behind that.

28:34.975 --> 28:35.495
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

28:35.836 --> 28:36.456
[SPEAKER_18]: He said no.

28:36.696 --> 28:36.997
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

28:37.317 --> 28:37.497
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

28:38.298 --> 28:48.165
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of us who were hanging out in the party room, there was a TV feed from the main room with the machine and there was a sign held up that says two inches of hot dick for you.

28:48.846 --> 28:50.207
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where that's from.

28:51.156 --> 28:53.378
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a point to two inches of hot dick?

28:53.418 --> 28:55.399
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was just a sign held up in front of the camera.

28:56.239 --> 28:57.440
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you crazy kids.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.100
[SPEAKER_18]: Swale!

28:59.421 --> 28:59.782
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

28:59.822 --> 29:06.766
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, I know I've asked the question again because I'm a dork and have the pause button on, but, um... It's okay, Jamie, we forgive you.

29:06.846 --> 29:07.146
[SPEAKER_18]: Bite me.

29:07.806 --> 29:08.127
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

29:09.908 --> 29:17.072
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, you know, once again, who's looking to be the top server for PA and what do you think's going to happen for Freestyle?

29:17.472 --> 29:18.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, Dave!

29:18.923 --> 29:20.664
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you suck a cock.

29:21.144 --> 29:25.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, Jimmy, Emphasis, I think he will do really well.

29:25.306 --> 29:26.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you're here.

29:26.506 --> 29:26.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Hola.

29:28.127 --> 29:29.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Hugo just came in.

29:29.548 --> 29:29.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Word.

29:30.768 --> 29:34.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think Emphasis will probably do really well for Perfect Attack.

29:34.570 --> 29:37.911
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said before, you don't know what's going to happen for freestyle.

29:38.332 --> 29:40.192
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be a good amount of routines.

29:42.393 --> 29:43.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DDR for God.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.854
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to win DDR4God How was the DDR4God routine?

29:48.234 --> 29:59.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I didn't see him Oh, I don't know I don't think he played Oh Well, what a load of crap Do you think we're going to have any waste of time today?

30:00.985 --> 30:07.531
[SPEAKER_18]: The tournament's a waste of time itself And now you have it That's it

30:08.679 --> 30:13.943
[SPEAKER_18]: And here we have a very special interview guest for our Orange Lounge radio segment.

30:13.964 --> 30:15.104
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead and introduce yourself.

30:15.685 --> 30:22.130
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I am the oh-so-annoyed and loving wife iguana girl.

30:23.251 --> 30:24.112
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we love you anyway.

30:25.273 --> 30:27.414
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, so what brings you here to tourney?

30:27.495 --> 30:30.357
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you competing or watching or just laughing at everyone?

30:31.238 --> 30:32.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Mostly just laughing at everyone.

30:33.159 --> 30:34.861
[SPEAKER_16]: Who do you think is going to come out for PA?

30:36.507 --> 30:42.072
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm thinking it's probably going to come down to Emphasis, probably Emphasis, Oki, and Virtue.

30:43.313 --> 30:44.915
[SPEAKER_16]: And what do you think is going to happen for Freestyle?

30:45.976 --> 30:47.016
[SPEAKER_16]: I really have no idea.

30:47.877 --> 30:55.063
[SPEAKER_16]: Somehow I think Wendell's going to come out of it as one of the top, just because Wendell has this insane ability to always come out ahead.

30:56.625 --> 30:59.727
[SPEAKER_16]: So overall, are you having a good time mentoring?

31:01.049 --> 31:03.551
[SPEAKER_16]: So far, I haven't had too much time to...

31:05.080 --> 31:05.881
[SPEAKER_16]: It was very yummy.

31:05.941 --> 31:07.603
[SPEAKER_16]: Salad bars for like $3.99 rock.

31:07.643 --> 31:07.943
[SPEAKER_18]: Alrighty.

31:07.963 --> 31:08.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you very much.

31:22.495 --> 31:25.097
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna have a drunken nerd night You seem to like that phallic symbol

31:50.018 --> 31:50.478
[SPEAKER_18]: Guess what?

31:50.618 --> 31:52.199
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being a microphone whore again.

31:53.680 --> 31:58.323
[SPEAKER_18]: We have yet another person to interview, so go ahead and state your name for the audience.

31:59.744 --> 32:00.484
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're done chewing.

32:01.725 --> 32:03.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Kansu, otherwise known as Kyokyo Step Squad.

32:04.567 --> 32:04.867
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

32:05.747 --> 32:07.468
[SPEAKER_18]: And what are you here doing, attorney?

32:08.229 --> 32:16.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I wish I was, but me and Jay were both on the inactive list because of injuries or other reasons, so we're both SSA and security today.

32:17.054 --> 32:17.374
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, cool.

32:17.967 --> 32:20.628
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do you think of Perfect Attack so far and who do you think will come ahead?

32:23.030 --> 32:24.410
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having language filters, right?

32:26.151 --> 32:29.933
[SPEAKER_18]: Our show is rated for adult content, so go ahead.

32:30.994 --> 32:32.815
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.

32:33.335 --> 32:36.077
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a flying fuck till the freestyle starts.

32:36.557 --> 32:38.058
[SPEAKER_18]: And what do you think is going to happen for freestyle?

32:38.978 --> 32:42.320
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as there's no nasty guys stripping, I'm all for it.

32:43.647 --> 32:45.048
[SPEAKER_18]: We did have Gumby's boxers.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.729
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I was unable to make the tournament and I apologize for that.

32:47.809 --> 32:50.550
[SPEAKER_18]: I did see ass later on that afternoon, although I don't remember who it was.

32:50.690 --> 32:51.090
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my.

32:51.590 --> 32:53.331
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there was a cop right across the room.

32:53.711 --> 32:54.771
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't even know who it was?

32:54.831 --> 32:55.851
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see he was walking off.

32:55.871 --> 32:56.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it a dark room?

32:56.852 --> 32:57.752
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a nice butt though.

32:59.093 --> 33:00.073
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, well, well.

33:00.093 --> 33:02.854
[SPEAKER_18]: I really hope for that since I'm judging, oh my god.

33:02.874 --> 33:08.016
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I personally think that everybody performing for Step Squad is just going to kick ass.

33:08.136 --> 33:09.016
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that's me.

33:09.436 --> 33:10.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hell yeah.

33:10.237 --> 33:11.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Step Squad will kick ass.

33:12.308 --> 33:15.451
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, overall, you know, you having a good time?

33:16.352 --> 33:17.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes I am.

33:17.873 --> 33:22.197
[SPEAKER_02]: If only Hugo and Meg could finally figure out how much of what they own of me, it'd be all nice.

33:23.558 --> 33:24.459
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no scale yet?

33:25.080 --> 33:27.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently Hugo owns my soul, Meg just owns my body.

33:28.643 --> 33:29.244
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.

33:29.444 --> 33:31.085
[SPEAKER_02]: It works perfectly fine with me that way.

33:31.746 --> 33:32.927
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well we'll leave it at that.

33:32.967 --> 33:33.287
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

33:33.808 --> 33:34.188
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

33:35.229 --> 33:37.571
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the first Super Interview number one.

33:38.172 --> 33:38.372
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

33:39.276 --> 33:42.760
[SPEAKER_18]: and I am sitting here, go ahead and state your name for the lovely listeners.

33:43.280 --> 33:43.620
[SPEAKER_27]: Virtue?

33:44.501 --> 33:44.821
[SPEAKER_27]: Radical.

33:45.482 --> 33:45.722
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

33:46.583 --> 33:51.708
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you're here... Does that mean like his first name is Virtue and his last name is Radical?

33:51.728 --> 33:52.589
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I interviewed Radical too.

33:53.069 --> 33:53.609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

33:53.870 --> 33:55.071
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you did them both at once?

33:55.411 --> 33:59.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Sort of, it was mostly Corey, but... Oh, okay.

33:59.075 --> 33:59.295
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool, cool.

33:59.315 --> 34:01.136
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't hear Bradical, I heard Radical.

34:01.437 --> 34:02.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that was his last name.

34:02.177 --> 34:02.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical!

34:02.898 --> 34:04.540
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the Radical Virtue!

34:06.149 --> 34:07.429
[SPEAKER_08]: The 80s are making a comeback, you know.

34:08.009 --> 34:09.650
[SPEAKER_18]: So what are you doing for the tourney today?

34:10.290 --> 34:11.030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing PA.

34:12.150 --> 34:12.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else?

34:14.411 --> 34:14.751
[SPEAKER_27]: PA.

34:15.771 --> 34:16.051
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

34:16.251 --> 34:16.791
[SPEAKER_18]: And how did you do?

34:18.211 --> 34:19.072
[SPEAKER_27]: Oki beat me by two.

34:20.772 --> 34:21.492
[SPEAKER_18]: But you qualified, right?

34:22.032 --> 34:22.272
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

34:22.692 --> 34:23.673
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

34:24.373 --> 34:30.674
[SPEAKER_18]: So just give us a little bit of your Bimani history and what you might be well-known for, even though probably everybody already knows.

34:31.754 --> 34:34.195
[SPEAKER_27]: I started playing Bimani back in 99 with...

34:36.010 --> 34:37.771
[SPEAKER_27]: The good old Beatmania Complete Mix 1.

34:37.811 --> 34:40.553
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's very quick master up in this piece.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.535
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I played DDR.

34:44.036 --> 34:44.516
[SPEAKER_27]: It was lame.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.419
[SPEAKER_27]: Then I got bored with Beatmania and then I went back to DDR and I was like, wow, this is pretty cool.

34:49.599 --> 34:51.361
[SPEAKER_27]: And I took it like an ass for two years.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.463
[SPEAKER_27]: Took it like an ass, in the ass, however you want to put it.

34:56.484 --> 34:58.485
[SPEAKER_27]: And then here I am now.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.427
[SPEAKER_27]: Big name that I don't want to be.

35:03.889 --> 35:04.970
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, he's taken my place.

35:06.369 --> 35:07.530
[SPEAKER_18]: Care to comment on that?

35:09.171 --> 35:09.591
[SPEAKER_27]: About what?

35:10.252 --> 35:11.333
[SPEAKER_18]: About taking his place.

35:12.654 --> 35:13.234
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel honored.

35:15.055 --> 35:15.376
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

35:16.637 --> 35:20.119
[SPEAKER_18]: So, who do you think is going to come out ahead for freestyle today?

35:20.820 --> 35:21.840
[SPEAKER_27]: Come out ahead?

35:24.502 --> 35:27.825
[SPEAKER_27]: Call me stupid for saying this, probably one of the RTF peeps.

35:27.865 --> 35:30.227
[SPEAKER_27]: If Tran comes, he's pretty strong and everything.

35:32.528 --> 35:33.229
[SPEAKER_27]: Mel, maybe.

35:34.584 --> 35:34.965
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

35:34.985 --> 35:36.205
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll see what RTF has in store.

35:36.826 --> 35:39.167
[SPEAKER_27]: If anyone from ASK comes, they got it in the pocket, too.

35:39.187 --> 35:40.768
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

35:40.808 --> 35:42.009
[SPEAKER_27]: I might pull something out of my ass.

35:42.409 --> 35:43.790
[SPEAKER_27]: Make an ass of myself like I do all the time.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.873
[SPEAKER_18]: There's that comedy section, too.

35:48.673 --> 35:49.273
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's right.

35:49.454 --> 35:50.234
[SPEAKER_27]: I might pull out another.

35:50.254 --> 35:51.555
[SPEAKER_27]: I might pull out another.

35:52.015 --> 35:53.456
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, Brad just got blammed.

35:53.476 --> 35:54.216
[SPEAKER_27]: That's pretty harsh.

35:54.917 --> 35:57.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Can somebody explain to me what a blam is?

35:59.420 --> 36:00.320
[SPEAKER_19]: Beats the heck out of me.

36:01.041 --> 36:01.361
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

36:02.734 --> 36:07.096
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm hearing some interesting noises coming from the side that I'm not going to comment on.

36:08.717 --> 36:12.159
[SPEAKER_18]: So, do you have any final words that you want to say for our listeners?

36:13.259 --> 36:19.162
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I'm not that special, quit making me something special, I play a game, I pass the song, whoop-de-doo.

36:20.163 --> 36:20.843
[SPEAKER_18]: And there you have it.

36:22.064 --> 36:22.844
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, I was first!

36:22.864 --> 36:26.006
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we have now yet another interview.

36:26.546 --> 36:30.428
[SPEAKER_18]: So, go ahead and state your name for our beautiful and talented listeners.

36:31.718 --> 36:33.319
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Mr. Wendell.

36:33.339 --> 36:34.341
[SPEAKER_24]: I am part of the staff.

36:34.701 --> 36:36.263
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think any yet.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.606
[SPEAKER_08]: It was outside guarding the people who had to be hid away for P.A.

36:48.713 --> 36:52.694
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the reason he could keep up that act the whole time, is because he had influence.

36:52.834 --> 36:57.576
[SPEAKER_05]: If he had been drinking a lot later, and he can really chug fast, I saw.

36:57.676 --> 36:59.037
[SPEAKER_05]: Wendell is the beer master.

36:59.097 --> 37:01.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he like that beer guy on the man show?

37:02.418 --> 37:06.700
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not quite like the fox, but he's pretty fast.

37:07.961 --> 37:10.041
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty then, let's hear what else Wendell has to say here.

37:10.982 --> 37:13.523
[SPEAKER_24]: For the Dallarmandy summer vacation...

37:16.095 --> 37:18.819
[SPEAKER_08]: That reminds me, did Dollar Mendy ever make an appearance?

37:18.839 --> 37:20.240
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he was supposedly in town.

37:20.461 --> 37:21.242
No, he didn't.

37:21.422 --> 37:22.163
[SPEAKER_08]: What a bummer.

37:22.183 --> 37:24.726
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you just staffing the day and not competing, or are you competing?

37:26.289 --> 37:29.453
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm also competing.

37:30.641 --> 37:36.945
[SPEAKER_24]: and you're doing what's this?

37:36.965 --> 37:45.771
[SPEAKER_24]: I am doing single freestyle and comedy.

37:48.633 --> 37:52.255
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do you think is going to happen so far for Trader Day?

37:52.275 --> 37:57.519
[SPEAKER_18]: Who do you see coming ahead for Perfect Attack and who do you think is going to be your fierce competition for freestyle?

37:58.183 --> 38:03.567
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there's a lot of really good double freestylers that, well, double PA-ers, I should say.

38:04.307 --> 38:09.791
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, right now, I have in my jail this little twerp by the name of Emphasis.

38:10.311 --> 38:12.493
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, he kind of, like, beat me during the Royal Rumble.

38:13.273 --> 38:15.495
[SPEAKER_24]: And I had to, like, give him a pile driver, you know.

38:16.556 --> 38:18.197
[SPEAKER_24]: I have witnesses for that.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.838
[SPEAKER_24]: But he's a really good kid.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.279
[SPEAKER_24]: He can do doubles pretty good.

38:22.620 --> 38:27.263
[SPEAKER_24]: There's also another little kid by the name of Maneke Nekajavs.

38:28.092 --> 38:33.895
[SPEAKER_24]: He's kind of like tall, he's redhead, you know, looks like a monster, but he's like a teddy bear.

38:38.498 --> 38:43.821
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also have like that wacky little guy by the name of Okimoto.

38:44.141 --> 38:46.723
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, he, that boy, good.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.868
[SPEAKER_24]: And who do you think is going to be your competition in freestyle?

38:51.229 --> 38:54.672
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there's a lot of really good competitors.

38:55.492 --> 39:02.518
[SPEAKER_24]: I see a lot of really good freestylers, but you have that Hypnotix dude.

39:03.219 --> 39:06.081
[SPEAKER_24]: He's got that Darren's Groove thing going.

39:06.621 --> 39:11.085
[SPEAKER_24]: I also see that Fuzzy guy, Fuzzy Torso.

39:17.220 --> 39:20.182
[SPEAKER_24]: or whatever he's got fuzzy on him.

39:20.342 --> 39:22.123
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, you know, that's not my thing.

39:23.483 --> 39:31.388
[SPEAKER_24]: We also have the crazy, wacky players, and yeah, they're going to be really, really good.

39:31.748 --> 39:39.952
[SPEAKER_24]: There's just so many right there that are really, really good, and I can't say that I have much competition for them, but I'll do my best.

39:40.573 --> 39:43.014
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you'll do a good job because that stuff's well-earned.

39:44.187 --> 39:49.592
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we represent Step Squad as a good organization.

39:50.854 --> 39:51.915
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really all about family.

39:52.655 --> 39:59.582
[SPEAKER_24]: We do our best to promote peace in the community.

40:01.284 --> 40:08.631
[SPEAKER_24]: We go out there and promote the freestyle, make sure that nobody does them hand slaps, do them knee drops, bump their head on the floor like I used to do back in the day.

40:09.580 --> 40:17.043
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, we try to have fun and make it an entertaining scene when we do tournaments.

40:17.163 --> 40:18.364
[SPEAKER_24]: And just, hey, have fun.

40:18.444 --> 40:20.025
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're having a good time so far?

40:20.865 --> 40:24.407
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm having a very awesome, entertaining time right now.

40:25.147 --> 40:28.708
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though I'm kind of like running staff and running this little jail right here, you know.

40:29.009 --> 40:29.949
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my big old fan.

40:30.509 --> 40:31.990
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, guys try to escape.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.010
[SPEAKER_24]: I have the Wilson butt.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.331
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know.

40:35.126 --> 40:36.067
[SPEAKER_24]: Ben What's Ben's online name?

40:55.186 --> 40:56.367
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't remember right now.

40:56.427 --> 40:57.467
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded like Chubbs.

40:57.487 --> 40:57.927
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Chubbs?

40:57.947 --> 40:58.307
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you remember?

40:58.327 --> 40:58.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was.

40:58.768 --> 40:59.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's what I thought.

40:59.548 --> 41:01.329
[SPEAKER_18]: For a moment, my brain was like totally flipping.

41:01.449 --> 41:01.889
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I thought.

41:01.909 --> 41:06.071
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard this before the show and it was never made clear, so I thought we'd state that.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.752
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you doing here at the tournament today?

41:08.372 --> 41:15.115
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm competing in Perfect Attack and I'm part of the staff, moving machines, kicking people out and stuff.

41:16.355 --> 41:17.796
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like grueling work.

41:18.796 --> 41:19.637
[SPEAKER_28]: It's free pizza.

41:20.625 --> 41:22.246
[SPEAKER_18]: That's always a good reason.

41:23.126 --> 41:26.107
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do you foresee happening for Perfect Attack today?

41:26.147 --> 41:27.408
[SPEAKER_18]: Who do you think is going to come ahead?

41:27.488 --> 41:29.129
[SPEAKER_28]: I think Oki will sweep.

41:33.230 --> 41:34.231
[SPEAKER_28]: Oki's going to win first.

41:34.811 --> 41:35.491
[SPEAKER_28]: Corey's going to fail.

41:36.972 --> 41:37.232
[SPEAKER_18]: I see.

41:38.352 --> 41:41.494
[SPEAKER_18]: And what do you see happening for Freestyle Literature?

41:42.254 --> 41:46.816
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't really looked over the list, but I'm pretty sure Fuzzy Hat will come up as some improv.

41:48.091 --> 41:54.054
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh... Hypnotics might win, and... Kyle Snyder will entertain us all.

41:54.514 --> 41:55.595
[SPEAKER_18]: But Kyle Snyder never showed.

41:55.615 --> 41:55.895
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed.

41:57.035 --> 42:02.978
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so just to go ahead and give everyone a little bit of history, you know, what's your history in the Demani scene?

42:03.598 --> 42:07.140
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I've been playing at the Boardwalk three years ago, two and a half.

42:08.320 --> 42:12.522
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh... My first big tournament was March Madness, which was about six months ago.

42:13.182 --> 42:16.964
[SPEAKER_28]: Until then, I've been at every tournament, pretty much, since March Madness.

42:17.651 --> 42:18.971
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, thank you for the interview.

42:19.711 --> 42:20.152
No problem.

42:21.732 --> 42:22.812
[SPEAKER_18]: More interviews, yay.

42:23.232 --> 42:23.472
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

42:24.413 --> 42:32.454
[SPEAKER_18]: I got another person to interview, so go ahead and for our listeners, state your name and your brief history in the Bimani community.

42:32.975 --> 42:33.815
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your favorite color?

42:33.835 --> 42:35.415
[SPEAKER_12]: My brief history in the Bimani community.

42:36.435 --> 42:37.356
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a community?

42:39.876 --> 42:40.676
[SPEAKER_18]: More like a commune.

42:41.136 --> 42:43.257
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a communist party.

42:44.312 --> 42:44.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

42:45.673 --> 42:46.774
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what it's more like.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.255
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever hear about Waco?

42:48.535 --> 42:49.496
[SPEAKER_17]: Big bread party.

42:53.839 --> 42:54.259
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

42:54.299 --> 42:55.019
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody got a bus.

42:56.260 --> 42:56.781
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

42:57.321 --> 42:58.942
[SPEAKER_12]: I go by the name STI.

43:01.244 --> 43:02.144
[SPEAKER_12]: What, my brief history?

43:03.105 --> 43:13.412
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of the three original founders of Step Squad, which is me, Jay Kinetic, and Strider, Vegeta.

43:14.261 --> 43:14.721
[SPEAKER_12]: A.K.A.

43:14.761 --> 43:15.161
[SPEAKER_12]: Strizzy.

43:17.162 --> 43:17.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

43:19.163 --> 43:27.646
[SPEAKER_12]: I've entered too many tournaments to count, and just now I've actually taken it seriously on freestyling.

43:27.726 --> 43:33.089
[SPEAKER_12]: So instead of just half-assing everything, I might as well do a routine.

43:34.569 --> 43:36.890
[SPEAKER_12]: Last time I got a routine, but I failed the song.

43:37.350 --> 43:39.051
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well, giving another shot again.

43:39.271 --> 43:40.272
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I'm here.

43:41.032 --> 43:43.693
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think of your competition for freestyle today?

43:45.633 --> 43:52.198
[SPEAKER_12]: The dudes from Ass is like really good, and I think there's like two other people that are doing the same song I am.

43:54.459 --> 43:58.602
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been practicing it today, but I've been moving alright.

44:00.564 --> 44:01.845
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, man.

44:01.905 --> 44:02.665
[SPEAKER_12]: Wendell's cool.

44:03.846 --> 44:09.470
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't consider him competition, so I don't care how high a place or whatever, and...

44:11.445 --> 44:13.006
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even care about placing.

44:13.026 --> 44:16.970
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to have fun, do what I'm supposed to do, and entertain people.

44:18.231 --> 44:21.093
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds like a really good philosophy to have.

44:21.433 --> 44:28.679
[SPEAKER_18]: I've noticed that some people get really, really heavy on the competition, on the have-to-be-better aspect of me.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.160
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think of that kind of attitude?

44:31.141 --> 44:33.803
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like I had this mentality.

44:33.823 --> 44:38.067
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, oh, man, I have to place top five, and I never end up doing it.

44:38.107 --> 44:39.848
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just like, you know, forget it.

44:39.888 --> 44:40.349
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to...

44:41.334 --> 44:47.437
[SPEAKER_12]: Do what I want to do, just dance and just entertain people, just show off some dance moves, whatever.

44:48.797 --> 44:49.278
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

44:49.678 --> 44:51.219
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to go do my thing.

44:51.239 --> 44:53.159
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if people don't like it or whatever.

44:53.179 --> 44:55.761
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as I have fun out there and I feel okay.

44:55.781 --> 44:57.882
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a final word for the listeners?

44:59.542 --> 45:00.023
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

45:02.404 --> 45:02.804
[SPEAKER_12]: Word.

45:05.565 --> 45:05.985
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed.

45:06.986 --> 45:07.246
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

45:07.688 --> 45:11.854
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it for the first round of interviews there from Dollar Mindy's Summer Vacation.

45:12.435 --> 45:13.436
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was quite fun.

45:13.756 --> 45:13.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

45:14.437 --> 45:15.519
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think of that?

45:15.599 --> 45:17.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Good group of people to interview there.

45:17.944 --> 45:19.605
[SPEAKER_18]: They were all very good about it.

45:21.126 --> 45:25.248
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all for putting up with me shoving a microphone up your nose or anything.

45:25.588 --> 45:29.430
[SPEAKER_08]: No complete drunks yet, but... Not yet, but we get them later.

45:29.630 --> 45:32.471
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have more sets of interviews coming a little later in the show.

45:32.491 --> 45:35.052
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a great interview with Jahi in the second set of interviews.

45:35.252 --> 45:36.033
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was fun.

45:36.513 --> 45:39.795
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the last set of interviews, you've got DarkSound.

45:39.815 --> 45:41.676
[SPEAKER_08]: You're interviewing him, the master of the tournament.

45:42.236 --> 45:46.458
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason why the webcast on DDR Freak didn't end up happening...

45:47.038 --> 45:50.619
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those of you that were curious about what happened there, he gives the explanation.

45:50.679 --> 45:51.099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all there.

45:51.119 --> 45:52.559
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play that for you a little later in the show.

45:53.119 --> 46:01.141
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, if you weren't listening to the show a little bit earlier, we played for you Memories, the new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song.

46:01.421 --> 46:05.042
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was given to me from our chatroom comedian, Pyro Man.

46:05.622 --> 46:09.203
[SPEAKER_08]: And I promised him, since I played that, that I would play Destiny.

46:09.263 --> 46:10.203
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will play Destiny.

46:10.703 --> 46:16.666
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after Destiny, we've got two brand new 8th Style songs we're going to premiere for you right here.

46:17.247 --> 46:19.448
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtue from 2DX Style, big thank you to him.

46:19.568 --> 46:23.750
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and visit 2DXStyle.net for all the latest and greatest 2DX news.

46:25.971 --> 46:26.652
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't already.

46:27.272 --> 46:31.674
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to hear some new stuff from 8th Style, thanks to those guys there.

46:31.754 --> 46:34.396
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's first hear Destiny and then we'll get to the 8th Style stuff.

46:34.696 --> 46:36.577
[SPEAKER_08]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.094
Thanks for watching!

48:16.297 --> 48:19.338
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, as promised, here we go with some new 8th style tracks.

48:19.758 --> 48:24.020
[SPEAKER_08]: This first one is DJ Taka with M. And by the way, this is the first time I'll have even heard these.

48:24.420 --> 48:27.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of us in the room will have heard these live here on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:27.682 --> 48:30.143
[SPEAKER_08]: From 8th style, DJ Taka with M.

49:31.324 --> 49:32.212
Thanks for watching!

50:19.195 --> 50:21.316
[SPEAKER_08]: from 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio.

50:21.336 --> 50:27.779
[SPEAKER_08]: That was DJ Taco with M. Big thanks to the folks at 2DXStyle.net and 2DXStyle.com.

50:27.919 --> 50:28.639
[SPEAKER_08]: They both work now.

50:29.340 --> 50:31.240
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've been yelling at me because I haven't been saying .com.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.721
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's how they're going to promote it now.

50:32.761 --> 50:34.202
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it was .net, but whatever.

50:34.922 --> 50:38.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we were thinking, sounds a lot like V, doesn't it, that song?

50:41.246 --> 50:42.967
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is ass, okay?

50:43.107 --> 50:43.867
[SPEAKER_04]: That was crap.

50:43.927 --> 50:44.888
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is he doing?

50:45.208 --> 50:48.470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a classical piano piece and add a beat to it.

50:49.050 --> 50:49.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gee.

50:49.790 --> 50:51.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you just throw Impolitary into there, too?

50:51.991 --> 50:52.752
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be even better.

50:52.892 --> 50:58.895
[SPEAKER_08]: That would make it sound... Chatroom is very... They're racking their brains trying to figure out what original piece that's based off of.

50:58.975 --> 51:00.475
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley thinks he has it figured out.

51:00.495 --> 51:01.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you tell him?

51:01.456 --> 51:02.396
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from Moonlight.

51:02.416 --> 51:03.417
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another vibe rock.

51:04.139 --> 51:04.779
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ W with Gemini

53:21.181 --> 53:26.626
[SPEAKER_08]: That's DJW with Gemini, and we do believe the category for that will be elevator music.

53:26.746 --> 53:27.767
[SPEAKER_08]: God, that was awful.

53:27.867 --> 53:28.427
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

53:28.447 --> 53:29.508
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's mall music.

53:29.809 --> 53:30.369
[SPEAKER_18]: God.

53:30.469 --> 53:32.451
[SPEAKER_18]: Makes you want to take a nap or go shopping or something.

53:32.551 --> 53:33.191
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like it.

53:33.672 --> 53:35.273
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion here on Orange Lounge.

53:35.293 --> 53:36.895
[SPEAKER_08]: I preferred M much more to that.

53:38.116 --> 53:39.197
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree with Loki.

53:39.357 --> 53:41.038
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of dug M. It was cool.

53:41.078 --> 53:43.460
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that whole classical remake thing, but...

53:44.721 --> 53:46.042
[SPEAKER_08]: He does need to kind of reinvent it.

53:46.082 --> 53:46.843
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of been done.

53:46.883 --> 53:48.784
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had V, we've had A, Kakumei.

53:49.245 --> 53:51.386
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time, okay, M better be the last one.

53:51.426 --> 53:53.188
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to go in a different direction from there.

53:54.389 --> 53:56.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not that I don't like that genre of music.

53:56.790 --> 54:00.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Piano Ambient is awesome, but it's just he didn't do anything with it.

54:00.433 --> 54:01.694
[SPEAKER_04]: He just added a beat to it.

54:01.714 --> 54:07.699
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do a little bit more than just add a beat to the music, because it's really old.

54:08.419 --> 54:08.780
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

54:08.900 --> 54:09.280
[SPEAKER_18]: Quite old.

54:10.862 --> 54:16.731
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm kind of wanting things to go back sort of old school, how the songs used to be in Beatmania.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.555
[SPEAKER_18]: I want 5-key style stuff, you know.

54:21.201 --> 54:21.802
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

54:42.446 --> 54:43.307
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss 5Key.

54:43.467 --> 54:44.147
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss it already.

55:16.801 --> 55:17.582
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Populence!

55:17.602 --> 55:18.022
100 Combo!

55:18.042 --> 55:18.622
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty good!

55:46.552 --> 56:02.667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't wanna know what they say, no, no, I don't care They can't tell me nothing, I'm gonna go my way One, two, three, four, five, break the dollars, get out of here Come with me now, now we are going out

56:22.748 --> 56:29.435
I know which way to go, just keep on going There is no time, no time to be wasted now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, now is the time to get out of here

56:49.778 --> 56:54.581
[SPEAKER_13]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!

56:54.941 --> 56:55.481
[SPEAKER_13]: Holler!

56:55.661 --> 56:55.741
[SPEAKER_13]: P.S.

56:55.761 --> 56:56.102
[SPEAKER_13]: TTPO!

57:05.794 --> 57:10.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Our thoughts on the Mr. Brian and the Final Band with Crash from Euromix 2.

57:10.156 --> 57:11.837
[SPEAKER_18]: That song fucking sucked.

57:12.197 --> 57:14.498
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the biggest bit of ass except the guitar was cool.

57:14.718 --> 57:19.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's remove the Japanese singer and throw in a kindergartner who sounds like an old man singing crappy lyrics.

57:20.541 --> 57:21.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakdown.

57:22.202 --> 57:27.605
[SPEAKER_04]: Lyrics by Mrs. Kimball's kindergarten class sung by this stupid guy.

57:27.845 --> 57:28.665
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what it is.

57:28.825 --> 57:29.486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just crap.

57:29.526 --> 57:33.508
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a crappy song and add a crappy guy to it and we'll get some more crap.

57:34.583 --> 57:39.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, why don't they just make another... I know, he could sing Firefly, too.

57:39.688 --> 57:41.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I know, why not sing Dive?

57:41.811 --> 57:44.894
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure his voice would sound awesome on Dive.

57:44.954 --> 57:46.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Or True, you know, he'd be good for True.

57:47.497 --> 57:50.720
[SPEAKER_08]: According to the chatroom, it's white guys trying to do breakdown in English.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.923
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, wow, that was really bad.

57:54.023 --> 57:54.163
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

57:56.459 --> 58:13.974
[SPEAKER_08]: On behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, on behalf of the lovely DarkSakura co-host, on behalf of myself, Sky co-host, I would like to offer an apology for wasting one minute and 44 seconds of your life with that utter piece of crap song that is known as Mr. Ryan and the Final Band.

58:14.975 --> 58:17.377
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you please ever forgive us for that?

58:17.797 --> 58:18.778
[SPEAKER_17]: Send us money if you do.

58:21.833 --> 58:25.136
[SPEAKER_17]: Many can be sent to, you know, Jamie Summer's care.

58:26.017 --> 58:31.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I smell, yeah, DDR Max USA exclusive track.

58:31.303 --> 58:32.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, wait, no, it wouldn't be exclusive track.

58:32.785 --> 58:35.087
[SPEAKER_04]: New original for DDR Max USA, though.

58:35.187 --> 58:36.228
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just see it right now.

58:36.268 --> 58:41.674
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like the festering pile of shit that DDR Max USA will probably become.

58:42.655 --> 58:43.656
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.

58:43.696 --> 58:44.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.

59:03.171 --> 59:04.853
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna do my fuck you of the week

59:20.526 --> 59:26.089
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie likes to get all pissed off at something every week, and we call it Jamie's Fuck You of the Week segment.

59:26.209 --> 59:27.070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting ornery!

59:27.350 --> 59:31.872
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not always the sweet, innocent moderator that you might think she is.

59:31.912 --> 59:33.333
[SPEAKER_18]: Bullshit, I'm sweet.

59:34.133 --> 59:38.995
[SPEAKER_18]: I try to be, but, you know, after keeping it pissed up inside, I have to let it out.

59:40.436 --> 59:43.458
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, let's get to Jamie's F.U.

59:43.578 --> 59:43.918
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Week.

59:45.675 --> 59:54.319
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, my fuck you of the week goes to, um, I forgot what my fuck you of the week was gonna be.

59:54.679 --> 59:59.221
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yes, fucking Fantasy, in like seven of all things.

59:59.301 --> 01:00:11.427
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I've been, you know, Iguana Girl has been very nice to let me, you know, trade out my fifth style with her to play fourth style, so I've been, I said I'm gonna, you know, finally beat Fantasy and pass that back, because...

01:00:13.028 --> 01:00:22.673
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been playing 2DX that long, and I've always been slow with picking up some of the stuff for the running runs, although once I learn something, I really don't forget it.

01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:27.096
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've been struggling with fantasy, and I've been getting 72, 76, 78, 78, 78, 78...

01:00:31.398 --> 01:00:37.479
[SPEAKER_18]: Every damn time I play the song, so I want my fucking border bonus, and it's about goddamn time that I get it.

01:00:37.779 --> 01:00:38.699
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I can give it back.

01:00:38.819 --> 01:00:41.100
[SPEAKER_18]: Although, on a good note, I did finally pass a check or two.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:42.520
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you go.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:51.402
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am probably about a couple weeks away from having my first seven-star beaten.

01:00:52.202 --> 01:00:52.942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're very close.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:53.662
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you play it today.

01:00:53.702 --> 01:00:54.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Voltage or Y31.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.163
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an F view of the week.

01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:10.540
[SPEAKER_08]: A big fuck you, this is going to be short and sweet, a big fuck you to Walgreens for not having any vanilla coke in stock today, and on top of that, not having any Pepsi Blue in stock today.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.202
[SPEAKER_18]: That stuff tastes like shit.

01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:16.025
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good dessert drink for me, just let me have my fun.

01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:18.098
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good shit.

01:01:18.118 --> 01:01:22.179
[SPEAKER_17]: It tastes like someone ate a bunch of strawberries and cotton candy and puked it into a jar.

01:01:22.419 --> 01:01:28.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, regardless, Walgreens did not carry the puke in the jar that I happen to like, so a big fuck you to Walgreens.

01:01:28.941 --> 01:01:29.981
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, you have a fuck you of the week.

01:01:31.181 --> 01:01:31.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:38.063
[SPEAKER_04]: My fuck you of the week... I had to give you a song, I'm sorry.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:39.383
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate this song.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.424
[SPEAKER_04]: My fuck you of the week goes to the Concord City Planners.

01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:45.235
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell were you thinking with the streets?

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.997
[SPEAKER_04]: Streets are supposed to have perpendicular intersections, okay?

01:01:49.197 --> 01:01:53.899
[SPEAKER_04]: This crap of winding streets that you have in there is just unnecessary.

01:01:54.339 --> 01:01:57.741
[SPEAKER_04]: I got lost about four times in Concord, and it should have been really simple.

01:01:58.341 --> 01:01:59.842
[SPEAKER_18]: Might I add that was on the same road.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was on the same damn roads.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:05.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was like Stratton or something like that.

01:02:05.533 --> 01:02:06.973
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just pathetic.

01:02:07.113 --> 01:02:12.996
[SPEAKER_04]: This road makes three different turns, and they have streets intersecting with it.

01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:14.036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crap.

01:02:14.316 --> 01:02:15.237
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my F.U.

01:02:15.277 --> 01:02:15.857
[SPEAKER_04]: goes out to them.

01:02:17.117 --> 01:02:18.158
[SPEAKER_18]: It's raining crap.

01:02:18.538 --> 01:02:19.258
[SPEAKER_18]: Hallelujah.

01:02:19.438 --> 01:02:23.420
[SPEAKER_08]: Our chat room has some F.U.s of the week they want to dish out, so let me get to those.

01:02:24.142 --> 01:02:52.263
[SPEAKER_08]: SoCalKick says, F you JenimScream for not going to Power Station and F you DJ Ness for leaving early and fuck you PepsiBlue for making me sick and having a crappy cap that spilled on the cam I borrowed and it spilled on it and fucked the cam up, whatever that means PyroMan, our local chatroom comedian, would like to give a big fuck you to the Live365 lady that comes up whenever he tries to start the stream and it ends up delaying his stream by two minutes so, a big F you by them

01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:54.864
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's our Fuck You of the Week.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:58.086
[SPEAKER_18]: But my Love You of the Week goes toward Propel, put out by Gatorade.

01:02:58.647 --> 01:03:01.889
[SPEAKER_18]: This beautiful fitness water tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid and owns you for free.

01:03:04.311 --> 01:03:08.494
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the second part of the Dallarmendy interview, shall we?

01:03:09.075 --> 01:03:09.755
[SPEAKER_08]: We shall.

01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:10.476
[SPEAKER_08]: We shall.

01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:11.096
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

01:03:11.276 --> 01:03:15.400
[SPEAKER_08]: More of Jamie live doing interviews at the Dallarmendy tournament, which was just yesterday.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:16.581
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it was.

01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:17.581
[SPEAKER_08]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:17.842 --> 01:03:18.142
[SPEAKER_18]: All day.

01:03:18.242 --> 01:03:18.382
[SPEAKER_18]: All day.

01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:22.029
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing more interviews.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:29.152
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, go ahead and state for our listeners your name and a little bit of your history in the Bad Bunny community.

01:03:31.053 --> 01:03:37.815
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I've been in the DDR community for about two years now.

01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:44.277
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember starting out when we had Sun Valley Mall out here in Concord on a USA mix machine.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:53.005
[SPEAKER_20]: and everybody's fan favorite Orochi would come and play all the time and would just scare everyone off the pad, which is okay.

01:03:53.225 --> 01:03:56.506
[SPEAKER_20]: We finally figured out how to play and we decided to go along with it.

01:03:58.227 --> 01:04:11.295
[SPEAKER_20]: I met people like Wendell and ShadowMeTwice and Draconis over at the mall and we became good friends once we got a machine over here in Mountain Mikes and from there it's just been...

01:04:12.156 --> 01:04:13.497
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's your plans for the tourney today?

01:04:37.276 --> 01:04:44.060
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm judging freestyle today, because I don't play doubles, so perfect attack is pretty dumb for me right now.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.784
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really can't freestyle, so I decided to just be a judge, and that'll be it.

01:04:52.525 --> 01:04:55.786
[SPEAKER_18]: So, who do you think is going to come out on top for freestyle today?

01:04:56.867 --> 01:04:57.347
[SPEAKER_20]: Freestyle?

01:04:57.547 --> 01:04:59.208
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, there's some pretty good people out there.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:05.392
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's Wendell, and you got Takumi coming up with something, and then we got...

01:05:06.304 --> 01:05:10.207
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuzzy, and you've already got some good names out there, so I can't really tell.

01:05:11.509 --> 01:05:15.432
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, overall, what's your opinion of the Beimani community as it is right now?

01:05:16.573 --> 01:05:28.823
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, lately it's becoming more and more, quote-unquote, scrubbified with all these newbies trying to act like they know what they're talking about without asking questions beforehand.

01:05:29.404 --> 01:05:34.408
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I know, I'm one of the, quote-unquote, old-school people here,

01:05:35.526 --> 01:05:47.608
[SPEAKER_20]: And respect is still there, but these newbies coming up, they need to either just sit there and watch what's going on or ask sensible questions because this immaturity is just not working.

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:53.330
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you have any final thoughts or words that you want to leave with the listeners?

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.470
[SPEAKER_20]: All I've got to say is, Step Squad for life.

01:05:58.611 --> 01:05:59.011
[SPEAKER_20]: Works.

01:06:00.411 --> 01:06:00.551
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

01:06:02.214 --> 01:06:06.517
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to go ahead and add my personal note that I totally 100% agree because Test Squad owns.

01:06:07.778 --> 01:06:08.038
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.480
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have more interview fun.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:11.920
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.343
[SPEAKER_18]: So go ahead and for our listeners, go ahead and state your name and your history with the Bimani community.

01:06:17.384 --> 01:06:18.084
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see.

01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:22.667
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm ShadowMeTwice and I like playing DDR.

01:06:23.127 --> 01:06:27.390
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've been playing DDR for like two years.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.171
[SPEAKER_23]: And yeah...

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.020
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds absolutely awesome.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.641
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is your participation with the tournament today?

01:06:36.681 --> 01:06:39.801
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you competing or moral support or immoral support?

01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:44.442
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I guess I'm just here for moral support, just hanging out.

01:06:45.322 --> 01:06:49.943
[SPEAKER_23]: And if Dark Sound lets me, I might do my little old school routine from back in the day.

01:06:50.003 --> 01:06:52.184
[SPEAKER_23]: Otherwise, I'm just going to stand and hang out.

01:06:55.064 --> 01:06:56.684
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds pretty groovy.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:59.605
[SPEAKER_18]: So what do you think of the competition so far?

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:00.625
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you think things are going?

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:06.410
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I don't know too much about PA, but it looks pretty good.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:14.515
[SPEAKER_23]: I know I see some pretty good people here, like Virtu, and I know Mononeko Jazz is here, so he's good stuff.

01:07:16.317 --> 01:07:19.639
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm waiting for that freestyle, though, and I'm wondering if the webcam is working.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.983
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I'll have to check on the cam, but from the last I heard, I think that everything is supposed to be a go, so...

01:07:26.827 --> 01:07:31.750
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you have any final words for the Bimani community or for our listeners or anything?

01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:36.954
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, keep on playing the DDR and the Bimani.

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:38.415
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:07:40.616 --> 01:07:46.220
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, go ahead and state your name and involvement in the Bimani community for the listeners.

01:07:48.222 --> 01:07:49.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat the question?

01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:54.085
[SPEAKER_18]: For our listeners, what is your name or your nickname and...

01:07:55.678 --> 01:07:57.539
[SPEAKER_18]: Your history with the Belmont community, so the listeners know.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:05.344
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Emphasis, and basically I just go to Sunnyvale Golf Land every Saturday.

01:08:06.785 --> 01:08:09.047
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's your participation in the tournament today?

01:08:09.927 --> 01:08:15.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just got to the second round, and I was first in qualifying.

01:08:15.131 --> 01:08:16.852
[SPEAKER_18]: That's for Perfect Attack?

01:08:17.272 --> 01:08:17.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:08:18.073 --> 01:08:19.474
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you doing a freestyle at all?

01:08:20.134 --> 01:08:20.394
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:08:21.455 --> 01:08:24.337
[SPEAKER_18]: So who do you think is your strongest competition in Perfect Attack?

01:08:25.575 --> 01:08:29.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, Oki, because his scores in doubles Oni are insane.

01:08:30.697 --> 01:08:31.037
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:08:31.697 --> 01:08:35.378
[SPEAKER_18]: So, what's your view of the Bimani community as it is today?

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting worse.

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:39.299
[SPEAKER_18]: Like in what way?

01:08:40.239 --> 01:08:45.741
[SPEAKER_03]: More, it's just, too much, as you say, drama.

01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:48.002
[SPEAKER_18]: Drama sucks.

01:08:48.302 --> 01:08:50.903
[SPEAKER_18]: So, do you have any final words for the listeners?

01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:52.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:55.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Freestyle takes creativity.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.321
[SPEAKER_03]: PA takes nothing.

01:08:57.922 --> 01:08:59.203
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I PA.

01:09:00.443 --> 01:09:00.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:09:02.124 --> 01:09:03.886
[SPEAKER_08]: What's with all this hate for PA today?

01:09:06.087 --> 01:09:06.967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really boring.

01:09:06.987 --> 01:09:07.548
[SPEAKER_17]: It was long.

01:09:07.808 --> 01:09:09.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very long, like six hours.

01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:12.031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's as exciting as golf is.

01:09:14.432 --> 01:09:17.454
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a tournament one day with exciting PA, I guarantee it.

01:09:17.878 --> 01:09:24.102
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, when they start doing the trivia questions mixed in with PA and start beating people with bats, when they get questions wrong, that will be the day.

01:09:24.762 --> 01:09:30.046
[SPEAKER_08]: It is something I would like to do for the next PA if we do a tournament here in Sacramento, which, by the way, we are trying to plan.

01:09:30.326 --> 01:09:32.407
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have details on that for you as soon as we get them.

01:09:33.108 --> 01:09:35.069
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice little distant plug there.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.050
[SPEAKER_08]: And now back to the interviews.

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:39.192
[SPEAKER_18]: This is round 20 million for the interviews.

01:09:40.072 --> 01:09:44.015
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead and state your name and your history in the Baymani community for the listeners.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:45.971
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm Paulo Zambrano.

01:09:46.252 --> 01:09:52.377
[SPEAKER_30]: I go in the DDR community as Rock My Socks Off, and in the Poetry Slam community I'm known as the Freaky Funky Space Monkey.

01:09:52.818 --> 01:09:54.279
[SPEAKER_30]: Isn't that a flavor of Ben and Jerry's?

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.621
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no idea, but this guy was cool.

01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:57.722
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, he sounds pretty cool.

01:09:57.742 --> 01:10:04.289
[SPEAKER_30]: And I've been involved in the Binami scene for about two years, although I've been playing DDR for about a year and three months now.

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.914
[SPEAKER_18]: So are you in here competing or moral support, immoral support, observing?

01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:17.784
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, it's really funny you bring that up because I'm doing a documentary about DDR in the Bay Area NoCal scene.

01:10:18.365 --> 01:10:20.627
[SPEAKER_30]: And let's see, I didn't pre-register.

01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:23.489
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have a tripod, but I have a camera.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:31.076
[SPEAKER_30]: And the only way that Ruben or DarkSound is going to let me get in the actual pit area where all the freestyle action is going to go down.

01:10:31.456 --> 01:10:34.899
[SPEAKER_30]: So I actually register under freestyle, I suppose.

01:10:35.539 --> 01:10:41.641
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm probably just going to register under freestyle and own the waste of time bracket just for the hell of it.

01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:46.202
[SPEAKER_18]: And who do you think is going to be your number one competition in the waste of time bracket?

01:10:48.582 --> 01:10:49.203
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know.

01:10:50.763 --> 01:10:51.943
[SPEAKER_30]: All I know is I'm going to own it.

01:10:52.103 --> 01:10:53.684
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's just put it that way.

01:10:53.704 --> 01:10:55.204
[SPEAKER_18]: How's that for an honest answer?

01:10:55.664 --> 01:10:58.465
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's your view on the Beimani community so far?

01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:00.685
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, especially in regards to that documentary you're doing.

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:02.926
[SPEAKER_30]: It's hard to say actually because...

01:11:03.633 --> 01:11:25.989
[SPEAKER_30]: It was really, from what I could observe in the SF scene, it was really going down, then it was going up, with the whole rise of Riptide Arcade as being hailed as the golf land of SF, but I would have to say there's a lot less, I'm not sure, from what I could tell, unity in the community for so right now, because there's a lot of, I don't know, disenchantment, I suppose, and a lot of noobs getting in the community.

01:11:26.009 --> 01:11:28.491
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not saying that's a bad thing, because we were all noobs, but...

01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:34.453
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a lot of cocky noobs and a lot of cynicism from the old schoolers, so that's what my take on it.

01:11:35.634 --> 01:11:40.996
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you have any advice for new players or just for the listeners in general?

01:11:41.056 --> 01:11:41.597
[SPEAKER_18]: Any final words?

01:11:42.977 --> 01:11:45.939
[SPEAKER_30]: Advice-wise, let's put it this way.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:53.462
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm still a noob, although, I don't know, different standards, but just keep doing it, keep trying.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.143
[SPEAKER_30]: Can I swear, actually?

01:11:56.303 --> 01:11:57.464
[SPEAKER_30]: Fuck what everyone else has to say.

01:11:58.952 --> 01:11:59.673
[SPEAKER_30]: And last words, uh...

01:12:15.077 --> 01:12:17.958
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, my doc is going to be out later this year.

01:12:18.978 --> 01:12:19.618
[SPEAKER_30]: Come see it.

01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:22.559
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to sell it to PBS and become moderately famous.

01:12:23.319 --> 01:12:24.939
[SPEAKER_30]: And, yeah, thanks a lot.

01:12:25.019 --> 01:12:26.619
[SPEAKER_30]: I like how he says he's not going to be famous.

01:12:26.659 --> 01:12:28.640
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just going to be moderately famous.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.140
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, like a local celebrity.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:38.522
[SPEAKER_05]: Moderately famous, like the woman, the British woman that insults everyone.

01:12:39.642 --> 01:12:40.822
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget what show it's called.

01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:42.703
[SPEAKER_08]: You are the weakest link.

01:12:42.743 --> 01:12:43.063
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye.

01:12:43.883 --> 01:12:44.243
[SPEAKER_05]: That one.

01:12:45.889 --> 01:12:48.111
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be more famous than that for a DDR documentary.

01:12:48.812 --> 01:12:50.814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's moderately famous because I don't know her name.

01:12:52.795 --> 01:12:53.396
[SPEAKER_08]: And something.

01:12:55.578 --> 01:12:56.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, now it's going to kill me all day.

01:12:56.979 --> 01:12:57.920
[SPEAKER_08]: My point exactly.

01:12:59.001 --> 01:12:59.321
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit!

01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:00.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, back to the interviews.

01:13:01.463 --> 01:13:01.783
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:13:03.064 --> 01:13:04.926
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we have more witty words of wisdom.

01:13:05.706 --> 01:13:07.128
[SPEAKER_30]: I dance to heal the world.

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:12.604
[SPEAKER_30]: I prefer the Marilyn Monroe painting myself, but hey, to each his own.

01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:14.405
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm doing yet another interview, so...

01:13:37.145 --> 01:13:43.346
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't mind, go ahead and give us your name and association and history of the Baymada community and whatnot.

01:13:43.826 --> 01:13:46.127
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, I'm Megumi, also known as Sweet Megumi.

01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:48.307
[SPEAKER_19]: I am part of Pet Squad for Step Squad.

01:13:50.368 --> 01:13:52.468
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's your history in DDR?

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:55.609
[SPEAKER_19]: I play DDR and I go to tournaments and I work for tournaments and stuff.

01:13:55.629 --> 01:14:00.490
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't usually enter them, but I'm there just... I'm interrupting this to say I looked it up.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:01.530
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ann Robinson.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:02.191
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:03.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Ann Robinson.

01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:04.171
[SPEAKER_19]: See you, everyone.

01:14:05.132 --> 01:14:06.294
[SPEAKER_18]: and Always Friendly.

01:14:06.755 --> 01:14:07.997
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the girl in the pink.

01:14:08.498 --> 01:14:08.699
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

01:14:09.239 --> 01:14:10.862
[SPEAKER_18]: So, what do you think of the tourney today?

01:14:11.604 --> 01:14:12.325
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cool.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:18.676
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people that I haven't seen for quite a while and I like the way Ruben has this set up as like, you know, the green room type of thing, so...

01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:24.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Who do you think is going to come out on top for PA or for Freestyle?

01:14:24.985 --> 01:14:27.106
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course I'd say Oki because he's my favorite.

01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:30.309
[SPEAKER_19]: And Freestyle, I don't know who entered.

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.591
[SPEAKER_19]: If AJ's here, he'll probably win it.

01:14:33.691 --> 01:14:34.732
[SPEAKER_19]: If not, I don't know.

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:42.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have any final words for the listeners or for the community or any sage words of wisdom from observation?

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.320
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.061
[SPEAKER_18]: Just play DDR.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:50.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed, how honest.

01:14:52.636 --> 01:14:53.677
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, Stas Kwarant.

01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:56.218
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we do.

01:14:57.599 --> 01:14:58.940
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, thank you.

01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:01.101
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.

01:15:03.263 --> 01:15:06.565
[SPEAKER_18]: And the newest in line of interviews for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:06.685 --> 01:15:10.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead and tell everyone who you are and a little bit about your involvement in the community.

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:16.046
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up, yo, this is Jay Kinetic representing the SSF Step Squad family as well as the Step Squad Assassins and Pet Squad.

01:15:16.366 --> 01:15:21.108
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been playing this game since some of you didn't even know 1.5 was back in MGL so I could be considered an OG.

01:15:22.429 --> 01:15:27.091
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, Step Squad was formed in order to bring more of a family element to DDR.

01:15:27.151 --> 01:15:34.655
[SPEAKER_21]: We wanted to be the alternative to most of the DDR free communities out there that are biased against gender, race, sexual orientation, you name it.

01:15:35.415 --> 01:16:04.530
[SPEAKER_18]: and we have about 30-35 players right now who are dedicated to the game as well as getting each other through tough times and just being there for each other like family I guess I have to say one thing that I need to comment is that the squeal of daddy in the background was Draconis' daughter Lily who is famous for she's also known as Fuzzy Half and is also famous for the quote this DVR sucks so I just thought I'd mention that because you can hear alrighty you sure nobody was tied up at the tournament or anything like that

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:07.469
[SPEAKER_18]: There was no bondage going on at the tournament that I saw.

01:16:07.549 --> 01:16:08.049
[SPEAKER_18]: What a shame.

01:16:08.789 --> 01:16:19.353
[SPEAKER_18]: So, as far as tourney goes, are you competing or working or, you know, how's your involvement with this tourney here?

01:16:19.893 --> 01:16:23.314
[SPEAKER_21]: Today I'm out in my SSA uniform, I'm providing security.

01:16:23.394 --> 01:16:28.876
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't had too many rowdy people, so I'm sitting here enjoying the Heineken courtesy of my friends Wendell and Cy, what's up Thieves Guild.

01:16:29.845 --> 01:16:31.966
[SPEAKER_21]: But normally I do compete in tournaments.

01:16:32.006 --> 01:16:39.869
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't have time to prepare a routine this time, but the next tournament I'm looking forward to is Scandia or the Disney's Rave Tournament, where I might pull an improv, I don't know, as well as PA.

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:45.612
[SPEAKER_18]: So far for the PA or the freestylers in each category, who do you think is going to come out on top?

01:16:46.072 --> 01:16:51.534
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping that Jazz comes out on top of the PA-ers in this particular tournament.

01:16:51.835 --> 01:16:52.955
[SPEAKER_21]: Freestyle is still unpredictable.

01:16:52.995 --> 01:16:55.516
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still not sure who's entered, so I'm going to try to keep a close eye on that.

01:16:55.536 --> 01:16:57.277
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to be hanging out here until about 9 o'clock.

01:16:57.657 --> 01:16:58.638
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's always a good crop.

01:16:58.658 --> 01:17:02.219
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some of the most skilled freestylers out here today.

01:17:02.259 --> 01:17:06.842
[SPEAKER_21]: We got Rain from RTF out here, Fuzzy Hat from Step Squad, just newly inaugurated.

01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:07.362
[SPEAKER_21]: He's here.

01:17:08.022 --> 01:17:08.443
[SPEAKER_21]: Wendell's here.

01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:09.523
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if he's competing.

01:17:09.563 --> 01:17:11.404
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be hot competition as normal.

01:17:12.124 --> 01:17:17.027
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's your view on the Bitmoney community currently and what type of advice would you give?

01:17:18.059 --> 01:17:22.004
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, okay, if you're just starting out, the main thing is, just go for yours.

01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:25.108
[SPEAKER_21]: Just do what you want to do, and do you.

01:17:25.509 --> 01:17:29.394
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't try to emulate what you see in the videos exactly, but get tips from it.

01:17:30.035 --> 01:17:30.756
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:58.593
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel that there are a lot of online communities such as DDRspot.com, DDRfreak.com, and the Step Squad message board, plug ourselves in there, that provide a quasi-decent environment.

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:06.175
[SPEAKER_21]: I say Step Squad out of the three does, but then again we're kind of a gay community in that respect because we only let in people that we know are people that are part of the squad.

01:18:06.195 --> 01:18:09.916
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't mean you can't visit, but the reason why we keep it that way is because

01:18:10.974 --> 01:18:17.740
[SPEAKER_21]: It gives all the players involved the chance to grow rather than having to deal with the prejudice and stereotypes of the DDR community at large.

01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:21.663
[SPEAKER_21]: This doesn't mean that the community at large is a negative thing.

01:18:22.383 --> 01:18:29.548
[SPEAKER_21]: Jason Ko, alias J-Dog, you may know him from the DDR Freak Boys, has encouraged a very large, very skilled community.

01:18:29.828 --> 01:18:35.913
[SPEAKER_21]: It just means that with that exposure that you get from interacting with that larger community, you may encounter more prejudice and more stereotypes.

01:18:36.193 --> 01:18:42.457
[SPEAKER_21]: Because for every one intelligent person there is, there's at least another nine who are like, Oh, I'm AZN and I'm Lee because I can pass all nine counters.

01:18:42.637 --> 01:18:43.258
[SPEAKER_21]: That sort of thing.

01:18:43.898 --> 01:18:54.722
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I feel that the community is growing and I hope to see it progress a little bit more in the United States, even though Konami of America can kiss my ass because they screwed us, but at the same time I still think it's going to grow.

01:18:55.442 --> 01:18:56.242
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't get screwed.

01:18:56.682 --> 01:18:57.422
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get screwed.

01:18:59.143 --> 01:19:00.003
[SPEAKER_08]: Why weren't we invited?

01:19:00.663 --> 01:19:04.745
[SPEAKER_21]: I still think people are going to be playing it in the States, and if not, hell, I'll go play Pump It Up, I don't care.

01:19:05.605 --> 01:19:08.526
[SPEAKER_18]: So, do you have any parting words for the listeners?

01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:26.996
[SPEAKER_21]: Shoutouts to RTF, Gary, Shintenshi, NoSkills, pretty much everybody in there, Rain, this is way too many heads of shoutouts, StepSquad, THC, TCL, Tag, the DJ Trunks message board, Orange Lounge, where he put me on this interview.

01:19:27.136 --> 01:19:28.796
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm on my third beer, I'm about to go get a fourth.

01:19:29.457 --> 01:19:32.318
[SPEAKER_21]: Jessica, Under Sedation Live, go to that website.

01:19:32.578 --> 01:19:34.159
[SPEAKER_21]: That show is funny as hell.

01:19:34.179 --> 01:19:34.959
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, thank you.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:36.840
[SPEAKER_21]: Travis, Ross...

01:19:38.735 --> 01:19:40.719
[SPEAKER_21]: Shouts to NorCal DDR, keep it live, man.

01:19:40.739 --> 01:19:41.801
[SPEAKER_21]: These other people getting lazy.

01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:43.164
[SPEAKER_21]: Tequila, shout out to him.

01:19:43.424 --> 01:19:46.830
[SPEAKER_21]: Shout out to nobody but Jen representing NY and the whole movement, basically.

01:19:48.273 --> 01:19:48.614
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

01:19:49.312 --> 01:19:49.812
[SPEAKER_21]: It's what I do.

01:19:49.832 --> 01:19:50.673
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for having me on, Jamie.

01:19:50.913 --> 01:19:51.233
[SPEAKER_21]: Always.

01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:21.233
[SPEAKER_08]: and getting some random interviews around there.

01:20:21.353 --> 01:20:23.075
[SPEAKER_08]: So you never know.

01:20:23.215 --> 01:20:24.195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you better watch out.

01:20:24.415 --> 01:20:27.397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be running around the bay with a tape recorder and I'm coming after you.

01:20:28.318 --> 01:20:33.321
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, a big hello to all of our new listeners tonight listening in for our coverage of the Dollar Mendy Tournament.

01:20:33.521 --> 01:20:39.325
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to join our chat room, just join Channel Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.

01:20:39.345 --> 01:20:43.768
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the server that hosts all the big Bimani channels like DDR Free, 2DX Styles, all those big channels.

01:20:44.148 --> 01:20:46.730
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on there too under Channel Orange Lounge.

01:20:48.184 --> 01:20:50.946
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm being given some results from SoCalKicks.

01:20:50.966 --> 01:20:54.848
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another tournament that happened over the weekend, and that was the Power Station 2 tournament.

01:20:55.388 --> 01:21:05.814
[SPEAKER_08]: And in PA, the first place winner was Trunks, second was Frost, third was LazyPinoy, and fourth was... How do I pronounce?

01:21:05.854 --> 01:21:06.595
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to mess it up.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.156
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen this before, I haven't.

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Senai Butterfly, is that how you say it?

01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:11.651
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

01:21:12.132 --> 01:21:15.695
[SPEAKER_08]: Freestyle, first place, Kenny Wood with Santa doing doubles.

01:21:16.115 --> 01:21:19.278
[SPEAKER_08]: In second place with Hungry Asian, he doesn't remember the song.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.739
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Jenith with Remember You.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.823
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Senai Butterfly again with Let's Talk It Over.

01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:30.787
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's pictures at 2dxstyle.com slash sck.

01:21:31.207 --> 01:21:34.189
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was all held on a fifth mix machine.

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:36.111
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good stuff.

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:44.394
[SPEAKER_08]: So, also I should plug our Bomani Music and More program, which is always on this network when we're not here.

01:21:44.874 --> 01:21:48.717
[SPEAKER_08]: All the music from DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania series.

01:21:49.177 --> 01:21:50.898
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's other random stuff in there too.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:51.879
[SPEAKER_08]: Busta Groove, Parappa.

01:21:51.899 --> 01:21:52.639
[SPEAKER_08]: We are indeed random.

01:21:52.679 --> 01:21:54.560
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll play whatever the hell we feel like playing.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.282
[SPEAKER_08]: Bomani and More on a dialogue-friendly stream.

01:21:57.802 --> 01:22:00.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did Channel Orange Lounge on the other side of the RC.

01:22:01.285 --> 01:22:03.606
[SPEAKER_08]: And one other thing, the Monday night rebroadcast.

01:22:03.626 --> 01:22:09.791
[SPEAKER_08]: If you missed any part of this show, if you missed our first set of interviews, we had a lot of people in the first set of interviews, we do rebroadcast this show.

01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:12.132
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be rebroadcasting these shows on Monday nights.

01:22:12.533 --> 01:22:18.857
[SPEAKER_08]: So tomorrow night on August 19th, tune in at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the rebroadcast of this show.

01:22:19.277 --> 01:22:20.839
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, we'll be doing it twice.

01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:23.561
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to rebroadcast it at 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock.

01:22:24.915 --> 01:22:26.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you're special enough to have it twice.

01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:54.566
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one other thing, the email.

01:22:54.926 --> 01:23:01.668
[SPEAKER_08]: Any songs you want to hear, any comments on the show, marriage proposals for myself or Jamie, send them along.

01:23:02.088 --> 01:23:03.149
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just refuse them though, sorry.

01:23:03.409 --> 01:23:06.350
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead and send us some hate mail too because we need some comedy.

01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:08.470
[SPEAKER_08]: We did get some hate mail a couple weeks ago.

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:09.530
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.

01:23:10.131 --> 01:23:14.092
[SPEAKER_18]: That guy was like, I'm not going to say anything because I'm nice and he was retarded.

01:23:14.192 --> 01:23:18.673
[SPEAKER_08]: Send all your love and hate mail to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.133
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all one word, orangeloungeradio.

01:23:20.973 --> 01:23:22.794
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to intro this next song for us, Jamie?

01:23:23.419 --> 01:23:25.341
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the one you were searching around for.

01:23:25.361 --> 01:23:26.422
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's just make it a surprise.

01:23:26.663 --> 01:23:27.664
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just make it a surprise.

01:23:27.884 --> 01:23:29.826
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the full version, but it's close enough.

01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:34.071
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back... More interviews!

01:23:34.111 --> 01:23:34.752
[SPEAKER_08]: Listless.

01:23:35.092 --> 01:23:36.454
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do the interviews at the end of the show.

01:23:36.474 --> 01:23:37.134
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do listless.

01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:39.237
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a really quick listless segment with...

01:23:40.054 --> 01:23:42.557
[SPEAKER_08]: Best DDR Background Best 2DX Song

01:23:56.974 --> 01:23:57.875
[SPEAKER_08]: was Absolute.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:23:58.595
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolute.

01:23:58.736 --> 01:24:02.739
[SPEAKER_18]: Best 2DX video was Love is Dreaminess.

01:24:03.139 --> 01:24:09.645
[SPEAKER_08]: And the worst Bomani song in history, next to Let Them Move, because Let Them Move is already assumed the worst Bomani song in history.

01:24:09.805 --> 01:24:10.886
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

01:24:10.906 --> 01:24:13.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye Bye Baby Balloon was determined.

01:24:13.028 --> 01:24:15.069
[SPEAKER_18]: So that song will no longer ever be on our playlist.

01:24:15.089 --> 01:24:16.991
[SPEAKER_08]: That song is banned from our playlist.

01:24:17.031 --> 01:24:17.511
[SPEAKER_04]: We will never play it.

01:24:17.531 --> 01:24:23.656
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to add the future song that should be added to that list, and that would have to be Crash.

01:24:24.097 --> 01:24:25.258
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is ass, and

01:24:25.798 --> 01:24:27.581
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope it doesn't get worse than that.

01:24:28.543 --> 01:24:33.631
[SPEAKER_18]: The name, contrary to popular belief, is not after, you know, an accident, although the song itself is an accident.

01:24:33.671 --> 01:24:34.453
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, what'd you say, Matt?

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.471
[SPEAKER_08]: God, this is awful.

01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:42.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakdown, then Crash.

01:24:42.633 --> 01:24:43.454
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the next one?

01:24:44.154 --> 01:24:44.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Stall?

01:24:45.275 --> 01:24:45.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I promise.

01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:50.159
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, the name is a combination of crap and ass.

01:24:50.579 --> 01:24:50.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Crash.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.524
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, Listless, and you have to be, if you want to participate, this is an audience participation segment.

01:24:56.804 --> 01:25:01.888
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be in our chatroom, Channel Pound, Orange Lounge, on any other side IRC network.

01:25:02.088 --> 01:25:03.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatroom gets to participate in Listless.

01:25:03.889 --> 01:25:06.191
[SPEAKER_08]: Best DDR background when we come back from this quick break.

01:25:12.096 --> 01:25:12.796
Thanks for watching!

01:26:16.147 --> 01:26:17.488
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:09.428
Run for your life!

01:27:09.488 --> 01:27:10.490
Run for your life!

01:28:54.975 --> 01:28:56.038
Thanks for watching!

01:33:25.604 --> 01:33:26.834
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S

01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:06.973
Don't break my heart

01:34:58.904 --> 01:34:59.865
Thank you for watching!

01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:10.295
Thank you for watching!

01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:36.351
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:37:02.848 --> 01:37:04.188
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we care what people think of us?

01:37:04.848 --> 01:37:06.689
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:08.149
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:37:08.609 --> 01:37:11.530
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:14.551
[SPEAKER_29]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

01:37:14.771 --> 01:37:17.492
[SPEAKER_29]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:18.314 --> 01:37:21.135
[SPEAKER_08]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:21.655 --> 01:37:26.236
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight we've been doing some of the Dollar Mendy coverage from that big tournament in Concord yesterday.

01:37:26.256 --> 01:37:29.516
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking a break to do Listless, one of our favorite segments here on the show.

01:37:29.916 --> 01:37:36.318
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be talking about tonight the best DDR background, that little image that comes up when you start the song.

01:37:36.658 --> 01:37:41.819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an artsy moment for DDR, kind of showing off the graphics capability, or whatever you want to call it, I don't know.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.145
[SPEAKER_08]: We were kind of debating, there was a lot of debate in house about whether we were counting the videos or not.

01:37:47.446 --> 01:37:52.412
[SPEAKER_08]: And we decided, no, we're not going to count the videos, we're just going to talk about the actual backgrounds themselves.

01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:55.536
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll do DDR videos at a later date.

01:37:56.077 --> 01:37:58.540
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what's going to happen, you guys in the chat room...

01:37:59.884 --> 01:38:01.345
[SPEAKER_08]: are going to be able to vote.

01:38:01.725 --> 01:38:13.149
[SPEAKER_08]: We will give each our top three, and then we're going to go through an elimination round, where once we have that big list of 12 songs, there's four of us participating, we each get to take one off of the list.

01:38:13.789 --> 01:38:16.050
[SPEAKER_08]: And then those of you in the chat room will get to vote.

01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:20.891
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to send me a private message in the chat room with your vote, and that'll be the winner.

01:38:21.592 --> 01:38:23.392
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll get back to the last...

01:38:26.092 --> 01:38:26.752
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, paranoia it is.

01:38:26.772 --> 01:38:27.413
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, let's hear yours.

01:38:51.946 --> 01:38:59.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, mine has to go for In the Mood for Dancing, because you've got that chick leaning over, and it's got the cleavage shot there.

01:38:59.593 --> 01:39:00.253
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's it.

01:39:01.054 --> 01:39:01.795
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

01:39:02.495 --> 01:39:03.817
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave, let's hear your number three choice.

01:39:04.357 --> 01:39:08.881
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is Abyss, because it's got the two yellow aliens, or whatever they are, in the blue background.

01:39:09.161 --> 01:39:10.422
[SPEAKER_08]: Good choice, Abyss.

01:39:10.823 --> 01:39:14.506
[SPEAKER_08]: My number three choice is Conga Feelin', because I like that chick.

01:39:14.546 --> 01:39:15.647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very abstract art.

01:39:15.727 --> 01:39:17.629
[SPEAKER_08]: She's got, what the hell is that coming out of her mouth?

01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:18.970
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that Conga Feelin' background.

01:39:20.811 --> 01:39:21.712
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so number two.

01:39:21.732 --> 01:39:23.714
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's hear the number two choices.

01:39:24.154 --> 01:39:25.756
[SPEAKER_18]: Brilliant to you for the mecha thingy.

01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:29.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Brilliant to you for the mecha dog.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.381
[SPEAKER_08]: You're being very old school tonight.

01:39:33.563 --> 01:39:34.364
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you mean tonight?

01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:35.165
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm old school every night.

01:39:35.205 --> 01:39:35.946
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, very true.

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't send me your votes just yet, chat room.

01:39:38.718 --> 01:39:39.638
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a list yet.

01:39:40.459 --> 01:39:41.139
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't vote yet.

01:39:41.519 --> 01:39:43.641
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to have a list, and then you vote off the list.

01:39:43.681 --> 01:39:43.901
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:44.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Matt.

01:39:44.901 --> 01:39:48.983
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be considered the most offensive background I could find in DDR.

01:39:49.044 --> 01:39:51.185
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have to go to OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.

01:39:51.205 --> 01:39:52.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.

01:39:52.165 --> 01:39:54.767
[SPEAKER_04]: With the guy in the fucking underwear with the pistol.

01:39:54.827 --> 01:39:56.588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just disturbing.

01:39:57.608 --> 01:39:58.068
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

01:39:58.148 --> 01:39:59.369
[SPEAKER_08]: OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.

01:39:59.649 --> 01:40:02.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, mine is Secret Rendezvous.

01:40:02.231 --> 01:40:03.271
[SPEAKER_05]: Secret Rendezvous.

01:40:03.311 --> 01:40:03.611
[SPEAKER_05]: Two chicks.

01:40:04.272 --> 01:40:04.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Always good.

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:09.896
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy into that whole secret rendezvous about a bunch of lesbians theory?

01:40:10.936 --> 01:40:12.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, they're rubbing up against each other.

01:40:12.818 --> 01:40:13.078
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:14.639
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:21.385
[SPEAKER_08]: My number two choice would be the Afranova background, but the OG one from Third Mix.

01:40:22.005 --> 01:40:24.007
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the newer one with the chick, the reptile thing.

01:40:24.087 --> 01:40:26.048
[SPEAKER_18]: Screaming into the thing.

01:40:26.068 --> 01:40:26.429
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope.

01:40:29.151 --> 01:40:29.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

01:40:31.103 --> 01:40:33.668
[SPEAKER_18]: We just also, by the way, our listeners did not hear what Dave just said.

01:40:33.929 --> 01:40:34.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

01:40:35.112 --> 01:40:38.840
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I thought the one with the reptile was the primeval.

01:40:39.682 --> 01:40:39.802
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:40:40.962 --> 01:40:42.343
[SPEAKER_08]: The Primeval one's all blurred.

01:40:42.363 --> 01:40:44.724
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one had the person screaming at the thing.

01:40:44.964 --> 01:40:45.304
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it.

01:40:45.805 --> 01:40:46.685
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one for me.

01:40:46.765 --> 01:40:47.706
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one choice, Jamie.

01:40:47.766 --> 01:40:48.846
[SPEAKER_08]: Best DDR background.

01:40:49.147 --> 01:40:50.887
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm no longer going to be old school at this.

01:40:50.967 --> 01:40:53.149
[SPEAKER_18]: I say Burning Heat just because it's Burning Heat.

01:40:54.089 --> 01:40:54.509
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:55.030
[SPEAKER_08]: Burning Heat.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:55.290
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:40:56.671 --> 01:41:02.234
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw Burning Heat and about pooped my pants because I was having a Gradius II... Oh my god, I pooped my pants!

01:41:02.554 --> 01:41:05.435
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I was having a Gradius II orgasmic moment.

01:41:05.475 --> 01:41:06.156
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw the ninja...

01:41:08.274 --> 01:41:08.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:41:08.675 --> 01:41:10.737
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Matt, your number one choice.

01:41:11.057 --> 01:41:13.560
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one choice is back from third mix.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.603
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be Get Up and Dance with the DJing Penguin.

01:41:17.725 --> 01:41:18.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good choice.

01:41:18.626 --> 01:41:19.587
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, good choice.

01:41:21.578 --> 01:41:23.700
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that, that's an often overlooked background.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:28.003
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my number one also has two things in it, like all my other ones.

01:41:28.264 --> 01:41:31.646
[SPEAKER_05]: Suguru, it's got the two guys in the yellow background.

01:41:31.907 --> 01:41:34.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Suguru, number one best DDR background.

01:41:35.029 --> 01:41:40.254
[SPEAKER_08]: Last one on the list, my number one choice, was also, oh Nick, please not so quick, so...

01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:43.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it started a revolution.

01:41:43.286 --> 01:41:43.766
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you say?

01:41:45.347 --> 01:41:50.649
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, since that was a duplicate, we're going to go ahead and let one more random one on the list.

01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:51.870
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Bradley back in the corner.

01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:52.951
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to put him on the spot.

01:41:53.251 --> 01:41:53.971
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't remember anything?

01:41:53.991 --> 01:41:54.611
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know anything?

01:41:54.751 --> 01:41:55.312
[SPEAKER_18]: Hot Limit.

01:41:55.832 --> 01:41:56.312
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot Limit.

01:41:57.633 --> 01:41:58.553
[SPEAKER_08]: I kept getting one.

01:41:58.573 --> 01:41:59.534
[SPEAKER_18]: You say Summer Love.

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:00.694
[SPEAKER_18]: B for you.

01:42:01.055 --> 01:42:01.515
[SPEAKER_08]: B for you?

01:42:02.415 --> 01:42:03.016
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about this?

01:42:03.136 --> 01:42:08.158
[SPEAKER_08]: One from the chat room suggested, I got a private message suggesting Breakdown with a big blue froggy thing.

01:42:08.358 --> 01:42:08.899
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Breakdown.

01:42:08.919 --> 01:42:09.419
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Breakdown.

01:42:10.356 --> 01:42:10.656
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

01:42:28.195 --> 01:42:31.977
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll get one vote if it doesn't get eliminated from the list, which we're going to do right now.

01:42:32.477 --> 01:42:33.258
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our list.

01:42:33.538 --> 01:42:46.845
[SPEAKER_08]: So far we have Paranoia, In the Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Conga Feelin', Brilliant to You, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Secret Rendezvous, Afronova, Third Mix, Burning Heat, Get Up and Dance, Sugaru, Breakdown.

01:42:46.885 --> 01:42:51.347
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be a hard one to start eliminating from, but Jamie gets the first pick.

01:42:51.447 --> 01:42:51.928
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakdown.

01:42:52.268 --> 01:42:52.568
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakdown.

01:42:53.569 --> 01:42:58.151
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, person who suggested it, but t-shirts aren't that interesting.

01:42:58.211 --> 01:43:06.177
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they're beating each other with telephone poles.

01:43:06.197 --> 01:43:07.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it just me that thought that?

01:43:07.597 --> 01:43:08.898
[SPEAKER_04]: They were working in rice fields.

01:43:08.918 --> 01:43:09.619
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like big telephone poles.

01:43:09.639 --> 01:43:09.919
[SPEAKER_08]: Sugaru, gone.

01:43:18.447 --> 01:43:19.247
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave, your pick.

01:43:19.788 --> 01:43:24.430
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, I guess I'll have to take off Burning Heat, because, I mean... Oh!

01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:28.011
[SPEAKER_05]: Although... It's a good song.

01:43:28.291 --> 01:43:28.832
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

01:43:29.132 --> 01:43:32.493
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not that great of a picture.

01:43:32.853 --> 01:43:34.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Burning Heat's gone.

01:43:34.654 --> 01:43:35.574
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a hard one for me.

01:43:35.594 --> 01:43:38.516
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not that good of a picture.

01:43:38.536 --> 01:43:40.517
[SPEAKER_08]: I like all these backgrounds.

01:43:40.537 --> 01:43:41.097
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

01:43:42.998 --> 01:43:43.819
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only one.

01:43:43.919 --> 01:43:45.660
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to... Secret Rendezvous is out of there.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.243
[SPEAKER_08]: So we like the lesbian... I like the lesbian video, but the background isn't all that.

01:43:50.543 --> 01:43:51.964
[SPEAKER_08]: The background itself is kind of boring.

01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:53.325
[SPEAKER_08]: The video's good, background sucks.

01:43:53.465 --> 01:43:53.905
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's gone.

01:43:54.265 --> 01:43:56.547
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's our list starting at the beginning.

01:43:56.587 --> 01:43:58.248
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to post this in the chat room.

01:43:58.308 --> 01:43:59.669
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys can vote now.

01:43:59.709 --> 01:44:01.330
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to take a really quick break.

01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:02.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one...

01:44:03.052 --> 01:44:04.735
[SPEAKER_08]: One or two songs and you guys will vote.

01:44:04.755 --> 01:44:06.077
[SPEAKER_08]: You only have two minutes to vote.

01:44:06.518 --> 01:44:11.126
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to send me your votes over private message in the channel or it doesn't count.

01:44:11.226 --> 01:44:15.775
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got two minutes and Jamie's now going to read the list for you guys and I'm going to post it in chat room.

01:44:16.463 --> 01:44:19.165
[SPEAKER_18]: As soon as Rob pulls up the thing so I can actually see it from a distance.

01:44:19.265 --> 01:44:19.625
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:44:20.165 --> 01:44:30.892
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Paranoia, In the Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Konga Feeling, Brilliant to You, Nick Please Not So Quick, Afronova, third mix version, and Get Up and Dance.

01:44:31.332 --> 01:44:32.593
[SPEAKER_18]: So vote now or die.

01:44:32.953 --> 01:44:34.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, vote now or die.

01:44:34.494 --> 01:44:36.355
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, one quick song.

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:37.616
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got two minutes to vote.

01:44:37.656 --> 01:44:40.257
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play one more brand new eighth style track.

01:44:40.318 --> 01:44:40.678
[SPEAKER_08]: This is...

01:44:41.539 --> 01:44:47.130
[SPEAKER_08]: and Shochiro Hirata featuring Saki with a song called It's Alright here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:03.505 --> 01:46:04.468
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

01:47:02.386 --> 01:47:18.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, sorry about that, we got dead air, I'm gonna play, uh, we're coming back, no, we're not gonna play anything else, we're just gonna come right back into this, hi, we're looking at the votes, no, we need a few more minutes to tally votes here, I'm just gonna play one quick, quick-ass song here, uh, hell, let's, oh, this song's only like a minute, so, uh, overblast.

01:48:28.464 --> 01:48:32.845
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Play Money Music and More Show?

01:48:33.866 --> 01:48:36.186
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful night, isn't it?

01:48:36.887 --> 01:48:40.288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.

01:48:41.028 --> 01:48:43.089
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:55.123 --> 01:48:58.624
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a promo, a very random promo, a fan promo that was sent to us.

01:48:58.664 --> 01:49:07.625
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to make a promo for our show, put your own damn voice in it, do whatever the hell you want, send it to Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.

01:49:08.366 --> 01:49:11.486
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, announcing our listless results.

01:49:11.686 --> 01:49:13.947
[SPEAKER_08]: I tallied up all your votes in the chat room and here they are.

01:49:14.467 --> 01:49:21.088
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the results for the listless best DDR background.

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:27.082
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to get a fanfare.

01:49:29.924 --> 01:49:34.907
[SPEAKER_08]: In third place for the best DDR background of all time, Paranoia.

01:49:35.648 --> 01:49:36.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

01:49:37.749 --> 01:49:42.493
[SPEAKER_08]: For second place, the best DDR video of all time, Abyss.

01:49:43.853 --> 01:49:44.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

01:49:45.274 --> 01:49:51.358
[SPEAKER_08]: And the very first place winner for best DDR background of all time, Get Up and Dance.

01:49:52.479 --> 01:49:53.220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

01:49:55.168 --> 01:49:58.869
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some more Dollar... Let's hear the last of the Dollar and Mindy interviews now, shall we?

01:49:59.129 --> 01:49:59.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's shall.

01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:00.090
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:01.570
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very short.

01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:03.131
[SPEAKER_08]: We've only got a couple interviews in this segment.

01:50:03.171 --> 01:50:05.491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only about three and a half minutes left of interviews.

01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:10.973
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have the interview with DarkSound and the reason why the web test didn't work.

01:50:13.514 --> 01:50:14.214
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay, more interviews.

01:50:14.234 --> 01:50:18.756
[SPEAKER_18]: So go ahead and tell everyone who you are and what you do in the community.

01:50:19.352 --> 01:50:19.932
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, what's up?

01:50:19.993 --> 01:50:21.053
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Fuzzy Hat.

01:50:21.394 --> 01:50:26.497
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm basically the youngest drunkard in the DDR community and freestyler debonair.

01:50:27.458 --> 01:50:29.720
[SPEAKER_18]: So, what are you doing in the tourney today?

01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:30.640
[SPEAKER_18]: Doing freestyle?

01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:35.924
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm doing some freestyle, mingling with some people, macking some chicks, you know, basically all that good stuff.

01:50:36.885 --> 01:50:39.327
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, who do you think is your main competition for freestyle today?

01:50:39.587 --> 01:50:43.910
[SPEAKER_25]: My main competition will definitely have to be the drunk Wendell and also the drunk Reign of RTF.

01:50:45.533 --> 01:50:49.756
[SPEAKER_18]: So, do you have any parting words for the listeners or the community in general?

01:50:50.277 --> 01:50:57.942
[SPEAKER_26]: Listeners of the community, I just want to say that for six bucks, a picture of Heineken that fills eight glasses is not a bad deal.

01:50:58.423 --> 01:50:58.863
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all.

01:50:59.323 --> 01:50:59.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

01:51:00.584 --> 01:51:05.368
[SPEAKER_18]: So now the tournament is over, and my final interview of the day goes toward the man.

01:51:05.948 --> 01:51:09.391
[SPEAKER_18]: So, tell us who you are and your history in the Baimani community, briefly.

01:51:09.911 --> 01:51:13.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Ruben Abdi, otherwise known as DarkSound, the jerk-off on DDR Freak.

01:51:14.936 --> 01:51:19.359
[SPEAKER_09]: My DDR history started a year ago with SVM closing the day I started playing DDR.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.141
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been Matt Mikers ever since, I suppose.

01:51:22.281 --> 01:51:24.483
[SPEAKER_08]: A sign of things to come, might I say.

01:51:25.284 --> 01:51:25.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Just teasing.

01:51:25.984 --> 01:51:27.245
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're out there, Ruben, I'm just teasing.

01:51:27.606 --> 01:51:31.789
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been called a swiggler, an asshole, a jerk-off, and a really sexy guy.

01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.950
[SPEAKER_08]: That was me, by the way.

01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.610
[SPEAKER_08]: They called him that.

01:51:35.031 --> 01:51:39.095
[SPEAKER_09]: So today, we had this really cool tourney, and it was cool.

01:51:39.935 --> 01:51:40.576
[SPEAKER_09]: You got any questions?

01:51:41.093 --> 01:51:44.656
[SPEAKER_18]: Did the tournament for PA or for Freestyle turn out how you expected it to?

01:51:46.337 --> 01:51:53.502
[SPEAKER_09]: PA actually took not as long as I expected it to, especially with the added delay of trying to set up computers to work right.

01:51:54.843 --> 01:52:01.247
[SPEAKER_09]: We were planning to have a webcast going at the same time.

01:52:01.588 --> 01:52:04.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, that did not happen because I forgot some cables.

01:52:05.991 --> 01:52:06.991
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard it here first.

01:52:07.111 --> 01:52:10.434
[SPEAKER_08]: He forgot cables, and that's why the webcast did not happen.

01:52:12.795 --> 01:52:17.497
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, yeah, um, took us an hour longer to set up than we thought I would.

01:52:18.178 --> 01:52:24.020
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, fortunately we were able to get replacement pads the other night, and, uh, everything from then on went pretty good.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:25.701
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions?

01:52:26.241 --> 01:52:29.862
[SPEAKER_18]: How about the, uh, as far as, you know, who won this and that, what do you think?

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:35.425
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think, uh, first and second place for singles freestyle was really close, much too close.

01:52:35.885 --> 01:52:38.426
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have actually hoped for a tie than something made that close.

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:39.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Gumby, shut the hell up.

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:41.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

01:52:43.431 --> 01:52:44.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I messed up?

01:52:44.652 --> 01:52:46.913
[SPEAKER_09]: What if your face is messed up, you fat-foreheaded freak?

01:52:48.113 --> 01:52:48.713
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right!

01:52:49.434 --> 01:52:53.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Dummy's in the chatroom right now, so I might say, address those cards and letters to Ruben.

01:52:53.595 --> 01:52:55.056
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's DarkSound at Spiggle.

01:52:55.196 --> 01:52:55.536
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

01:52:56.056 --> 01:52:58.537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I enjoyed Freestyle.

01:52:58.597 --> 01:52:59.918
[SPEAKER_09]: It was amazing.

01:52:59.958 --> 01:53:02.239
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish more people would have came, you flakes.

01:53:03.291 --> 01:53:09.095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was going to come, but I couldn't, I promise.

01:53:09.495 --> 01:53:11.697
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, stupid Soul Calibur 2 attorney.

01:53:12.577 --> 01:53:17.540
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it was incredible, manager-like turnout, got some money, I had fun.

01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:19.422
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, I didn't do the raffle thingy, did I?

01:53:19.662 --> 01:53:20.743
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there any prizes left over?

01:53:21.223 --> 01:53:21.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Did people just take them?

01:53:22.544 --> 01:53:23.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, that sucks.

01:53:23.124 --> 01:53:23.604
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, never mind.

01:53:23.905 --> 01:53:27.667
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so yeah, it was an amazing day.

01:53:28.087 --> 01:53:30.389
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoyed myself, it's going to be a pain in the ass to clean up, but oh well.

01:53:31.534 --> 01:53:35.996
[SPEAKER_18]: And what are your final words for the listeners of Orange Lodge?

01:53:36.016 --> 01:53:36.456
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR sucks.

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:37.917
[SPEAKER_09]: Go play Mr. Driller.

01:53:39.397 --> 01:53:39.617
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:53:39.957 --> 01:53:40.317
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen.

01:53:40.337 --> 01:53:40.618
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:45.479
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody, anybody have final words all at once to confuse the listeners?

01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:47.980
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely nothing.

01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:49.741
[SPEAKER_25]: Gummy pulled down his pants.

01:53:50.501 --> 01:53:51.602
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I pulled down my pants.

01:53:51.982 --> 01:53:53.803
[SPEAKER_18]: Gummy pulled down his pants, and there you have it.

01:53:55.683 --> 01:53:58.504
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my last special interview with Wendell, because he's cute.

01:53:58.945 --> 01:53:59.925
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, how's it going?

01:54:01.087 --> 01:54:04.229
[SPEAKER_18]: We're tired people and Wendell got drunk.

01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:06.131
[SPEAKER_18]: And Matt has my back!

01:54:06.311 --> 01:54:06.831
[SPEAKER_18]: Come back here!

01:54:08.432 --> 01:54:09.213
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it ended.

01:54:09.493 --> 01:54:12.415
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't even really interview Wendell, he just said, Hey, how you doing?

01:54:12.815 --> 01:54:14.036
[SPEAKER_08]: I interviewed him earlier.

01:54:14.056 --> 01:54:14.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you interviewed him earlier.

01:54:15.017 --> 01:54:16.878
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, he was talking with a normal voice that time.

01:54:16.898 --> 01:54:19.320
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to know what Wendell's normal voice is, there you have it.

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:20.781
[SPEAKER_08]: It just happened right there.

01:54:22.176 --> 01:54:25.158
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's our coverage of the Valor Mindy tournament.

01:54:25.738 --> 01:54:27.739
[SPEAKER_08]: The first of many tournaments we'll be covering.

01:54:27.799 --> 01:54:30.000
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I'll be able to cover one in the future.

01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:32.582
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie did an excellent job with that.

01:54:33.982 --> 01:54:34.943
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that, Jamie.

01:54:34.963 --> 01:54:37.244
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

01:54:38.745 --> 01:54:40.346
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we're pretty much towards the end of the show.

01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:43.567
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything that you guys wanted to add here at the end of the show?

01:54:43.888 --> 01:54:44.988
[SPEAKER_08]: Any final thoughts from the week?

01:54:45.008 --> 01:54:46.749
[SPEAKER_18]: One plus one is two.

01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:48.170
[SPEAKER_18]: There, I added.

01:54:49.525 --> 01:54:50.766
[SPEAKER_04]: The lyrics to Stick Around.

01:54:52.146 --> 01:54:54.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I have something constructive.

01:54:54.808 --> 01:54:56.568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the sim update for the week.

01:54:57.909 --> 01:54:58.529
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

01:54:58.569 --> 01:55:02.531
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got DWI 2 version 2.02 out.

01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:06.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it looks like the videos in the background don't work anymore.

01:55:06.593 --> 01:55:07.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:55:23.167 --> 01:55:31.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Actual link yet, it's not TeamGuilo.com anymore, it's off of someone's computer, so it's an actual IP address, and I have to find that and maybe post it somewhere.

01:55:32.475 --> 01:55:34.297
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about it.

01:55:34.517 --> 01:55:38.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Turning Mix 2 is still going, so check out those entries if the server's not too clogged.

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:39.521
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

01:55:42.108 --> 01:55:43.628
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other final thoughts from people here?

01:55:45.409 --> 01:55:46.709
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell are you doing?

01:55:47.029 --> 01:55:58.613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Dave is like, we have this, we have what we call LSD here in the room, although it's actually that, I don't know if you remember this from high school, at least it was high school for me, those little nuclear warhead candies that you could put in your mouth.

01:55:58.713 --> 01:55:59.613
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the liquid version.

01:55:59.653 --> 01:56:02.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Now these are liquid versions, they come in little bottles that look like LSD.

01:56:02.734 --> 01:56:04.995
[SPEAKER_05]: It slipped out of my hand and down in my mouth.

01:56:05.955 --> 01:56:09.236
[SPEAKER_08]: You almost swallowed the actual bottle, like the whole thing.

01:56:09.256 --> 01:56:09.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.585
[SPEAKER_18]: He likes it so much he tried to get the very last of it by consuming the plastic.

01:56:14.645 --> 01:56:16.927
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just keep that bottle, because I don't even want it now.

01:56:17.368 --> 01:56:24.235
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it's not safe for three-year-olds, and it's not safe for Dave either, apparently, so... Hey, did I choke?

01:56:24.695 --> 01:56:25.076
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I choke?

01:56:25.116 --> 01:56:25.656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still here.

01:56:26.257 --> 01:56:27.639
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottle is in the trash now.

01:56:27.659 --> 01:56:28.680
[SPEAKER_05]: You were about to choke.

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:32.564
[SPEAKER_18]: She didn't do what I do and spit Propel water all over the floor, you know.

01:56:34.009 --> 01:56:35.010
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to clean that up, by the way.

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.470
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:38.573
[SPEAKER_18]: This gag was brought to you by Gatorade.

01:56:39.774 --> 01:56:43.777
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, as we mentioned towards the beginning of the show, Jamie will unfortunately not be here.

01:56:44.277 --> 01:56:44.958
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately for us.

01:56:44.978 --> 01:56:45.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, my ass.

01:56:45.959 --> 01:56:47.020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fortunate for her.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.760
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be in Vegas.

01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:52.104
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to be partying in Vegas with a bunch of the other DDR freaks, so that'll be a lot of fun.

01:56:52.184 --> 01:56:53.905
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I can manage some interviews.

01:56:54.025 --> 01:56:55.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you should get us some interviews.

01:56:55.907 --> 01:56:57.328
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be a fine idea.

01:56:57.889 --> 01:56:58.269
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

01:56:59.010 --> 01:56:59.510
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can swing.

01:56:59.530 --> 01:57:00.431
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not too drunk...

01:57:01.793 --> 01:57:04.354
[SPEAKER_18]: You never know that more interesting ones may happen while I'm drunk.

01:57:04.995 --> 01:57:11.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, your co-host will be the one and only Matt, also known as Loki, because he's been here every other show, so it just kind of makes sense right now.

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:14.760
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been a big part of the show, so he'll be the temporary co-host.

01:57:15.455 --> 01:57:18.036
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, he's always in the big... He's like our footstool, you know.

01:57:18.056 --> 01:57:19.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's... He sits on the floor.

01:57:19.916 --> 01:57:21.056
[SPEAKER_18]: We just rest our feet here.

01:57:21.076 --> 01:57:22.957
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to put my feet right here.

01:57:23.377 --> 01:57:26.197
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's always been a loyal supporter of the show since the beginning.

01:57:26.417 --> 01:57:27.337
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like everybody here.

01:57:27.858 --> 01:57:28.758
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, you guys, for showing up.

01:57:28.798 --> 01:57:29.618
[SPEAKER_08]: I always appreciate it.

01:57:30.218 --> 01:57:30.998
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, LeFou.

01:57:31.518 --> 01:57:32.659
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for the final words.

01:57:33.219 --> 01:57:33.559
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley.

01:57:35.979 --> 01:57:36.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to say.

01:57:36.819 --> 01:57:37.960
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing to say, as usual.

01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:38.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave.

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.660
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's for Brad.

01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:43.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Cunt, cock, bitch, fuck, dick.

01:57:43.541 --> 01:57:44.661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:57:45.854 --> 01:57:48.837
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, all I have to say is M is the greatest song in the world.

01:57:48.977 --> 01:57:51.239
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, that was V. Never mind, M sucks.

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.160
[SPEAKER_04]: M is the greatest letter.

01:57:55.122 --> 01:57:55.783
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, no.

01:57:56.443 --> 01:57:57.124
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ending this show.

01:57:57.184 --> 01:57:58.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Jamie, any final thoughts?

01:57:58.536 --> 01:58:12.422
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is, um, tournaments need to be, you know, more like they were yesterday with just the, you know, the fun that went on and, you know, I had a good time and Matt wants my microphone and he can't have it.

01:58:13.403 --> 01:58:14.003
[SPEAKER_18]: And so does Dave.

01:58:14.023 --> 01:58:14.623
[SPEAKER_18]: God damn it!

01:58:15.084 --> 01:58:15.564
[SPEAKER_18]: You whores!

01:58:16.184 --> 01:58:16.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Dave for life!

01:58:34.005 --> 01:58:37.930
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget to listen to our Bimani Music and More program, always playing on the station when we're not around.

01:58:38.271 --> 01:58:39.673
[SPEAKER_08]: Whore out the show to all your friends.

01:58:39.733 --> 01:58:40.694
[SPEAKER_08]: We could use the listeners.

01:58:41.295 --> 01:58:42.256
[SPEAKER_08]: But we love you for listening.

01:58:42.276 --> 01:58:43.598
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

01:58:43.638 --> 01:58:43.998
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you.

01:58:44.339 --> 01:58:44.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

01:58:44.499 --> 01:58:44.859
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:45.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Tune in next week.

01:58:46.101 --> 01:58:48.764
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what we're going to be talking about next yet, but it will be a fun show.

01:58:49.145 --> 01:58:49.766
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise you.

01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:54.132
[SPEAKER_29]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:58:54.692 --> 01:58:57.835
[SPEAKER_29]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

01:58:58.495 --> 01:59:06.061
[SPEAKER_29]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

01:59:06.542 --> 01:59:10.185
[SPEAKER_29]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

01:59:10.845 --> 01:59:12.967
[SPEAKER_29]: Alcohol is your best friend.

01:59:13.127 --> 01:59:13.488
[SPEAKER_22]: And weed.

01:59:13.548 --> 01:59:14.889
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all about the crime.

01:59:15.049 --> 01:59:16.270
[SPEAKER_22]: Heineken and weed.

01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:18.372
[SPEAKER_22]: The perfect combination for a summer party.

01:59:18.972 --> 01:59:20.093
[SPEAKER_22]: Only if you're over 21, though.

01:59:20.193 --> 01:59:22.534
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want any of you 18-year-olds writing me or anything.

01:59:22.554 --> 01:59:26.736
[SPEAKER_18]: I still say, bike it in and vodka.

01:59:27.016 --> 01:59:28.477
[SPEAKER_18]: And stay away from Mark Kelly.

01:59:28.697 --> 01:59:29.878
[SPEAKER_18]: And stay away from Mark Kelly.

01:59:29.918 --> 01:59:30.538
[SPEAKER_18]: He's evil.

01:59:30.618 --> 01:59:33.260
[SPEAKER_20]: If you ain't drinking right, you ain't playing right.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:33.400
[SPEAKER_20]: Holla!

01:59:45.927 --> 01:59:55.915
[SPEAKER_22]: Sponsored by Heineken, Sapporo, Corona, Spottin' Beer, Maui Waui, Mota, and other types of various marijuana.

01:59:55.935 --> 01:59:56.715
[SPEAKER_22]: Shouts to Amsterdam.

01:59:57.296 --> 01:59:57.876
[SPEAKER_22]: And Guinness!

01:59:59.097 --> 01:59:59.598
[SPEAKER_22]: And Guinness!

02:00:00.379 --> 02:00:03.040
[SPEAKER_15]: and all the other sky shows because if it's not Scottish it's crap!

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:03.560
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right!

02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.420
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck Budweiser!

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.800
[SPEAKER_15]: Budweiser's shit beer!

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:06.641
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck that beer!

02:00:06.661 --> 02:00:07.281
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck tequila!

02:00:07.301 --> 02:00:08.421
[SPEAKER_15]: Tequila's Satan!

02:00:08.441 --> 02:00:09.961
[SPEAKER_15]: Tequila's the mark of the beast!

02:00:10.122 --> 02:00:10.382
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey!

02:00:10.422 --> 02:00:12.182
[SPEAKER_18]: Leave Adam alone!

02:00:12.422 --> 02:00:15.583
[SPEAKER_18]: Because personally we find your American beer a lot like making love in a canoe.

02:00:15.783 --> 02:00:16.263
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right!

02:00:16.283 --> 02:00:17.423
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking close to water.

02:00:17.603 --> 02:00:18.224
That's right!

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:19.624
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

02:00:20.264 --> 02:00:23.805
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
