You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
All your days are belong to us.

One, two, one, two, three, four, three, two, one.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy wave? You bitch!

00:49.000 --> 00:49.500
Bitch!

00:49.500 --> 00:52.300
Now let me check that this goes 2-1-2, fuck you!

00:52.300 --> 00:54.000
You have no morals, darling.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.500
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun in the scorching case of her case.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.500
Mecha lecha hai, mecha hiney hoe.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Me too!

01:07.000 --> 01:07.500
Ugh!

01:07.500 --> 01:08.000
Fucker, yeah?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.500
I'm working on it.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.000
Loser.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.500
Lame!

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
I'm as fine as my face.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.500
Breathing.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.500
Breathless.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.000
Heaving.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Breath.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.500
Heaving.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.500
Whatever.

01:18.500 --> 01:24.500
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.500
I am your singing hologram.

01:29.500 --> 01:36.500
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:38.500 --> 01:43.500
You're tuned in to the Bamani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things B.E. Mani.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500

01:49.900 --> 01:53.080

02:28.960 --> 02:35.140
some exclusive audio coverage and interviews of the tournament of the summer, do you think?

02:35.140 --> 02:36.140
The tournament of the summer, Jayna?

02:36.140 --> 02:40.140
It's probably the best fun one I've been to all summer, although I've missed some of the

02:40.140 --> 02:44.540
past few wins, but it was really just a fun experience overall.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.180
of the tournament

02:48.180 --> 02:52.320
uh... courses always report joined by many many in studio friends actually

very proud of you if you get a gold star for attendance

03:11.920 --> 03:15.920
We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break,

03:15.920 --> 03:20.920
and in that break we're going to have an original version of a famous DDR song,

03:20.920 --> 03:22.420
which I'm sure y'all are going to enjoy.

03:22.420 --> 03:25.920
Come join our chatroom on any other side IRC server,

03:25.920 --> 03:27.920
Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.920
No, we're not having Britney Spears!

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
No, Britney!

03:30.920 --> 03:32.920
But we can get petite love!

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
Oh

It's the first time in my life that I've known you since you've been here

05:09.920 --> 05:15.920
I've been waiting for you since you've been here

05:45.920 --> 05:47.920
Oh

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
Oh

07:15.920 --> 07:21.920
She is not all you need is love

07:21.920 --> 07:30.920
Money, money, money, money

07:30.920 --> 07:57.920
Tonight, I'll try to let you remember All the times that we were happy

07:57.920 --> 08:04.920
That we were happy together, sing a song

08:04.920 --> 08:10.920
You and me can be singing tonight

You don't get second chances

Love the night, release the seven senses

08:57.600 --> 09:03.600
Feel the flow, it's time to let yourself go

09:04.600 --> 09:11.600
Tonight, such pleasure, come on, just let yourself go

09:13.600 --> 09:17.600
Feel the flow, it's time to let yourself go

09:17.600 --> 09:20.600
All these hurts

09:57.460 --> 09:59.360
Just let yourself

Just let yourself go

10:00.900 --> 10:02.600
Just let yourself

Lose control

10:58.100 --> 11:01.100
Let yourself go

11:11.100 --> 11:17.100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

11:21.100 --> 11:25.100
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

11:25.100 --> 11:29.980
A real radio makes Jamie cry, too.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.220
The chat room demanded more promos last week, so we got some together for this week.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.220
Just a few, though.

11:35.220 --> 11:40.220
They did a special one, just because you guys bitched.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.900
So anyway, and now they're bitching in chat room, we're just going to have to make a new

11:44.900 --> 11:49.300
one for them, because they're not capable, apparently.

11:49.300 --> 11:54.020
In that set, you heard some of the former members of Morning MasumÃ© have their own

11:54.020 --> 11:58.620
little group uh... you wanna brown money thank you because i would have fed up

11:58.620 --> 12:01.860
and uh... the original version of the deal of called to go to the top

12:01.860 --> 12:05.540
took the total

12:05.540 --> 12:10.160
uh... after that was the vocal version of the song into the exit

12:10.160 --> 12:12.540
brings the closest orgasm flotation

12:12.540 --> 12:16.100
by vincent amore the man

12:16.100 --> 12:19.140
you're listening to katie m i radio don't i was kidding if you really

12:19.140 --> 12:22.340
believe that honestly i think the years that great anyway i'd like to let

12:22.340 --> 12:23.460
himself go

12:23.460 --> 12:30.780
rotation. Tonight's radio program is very last minute. I've been given a lot of things

12:30.780 --> 12:35.740
at the last minute. We're beginning a lot of news at the last minute, a lot of new MP3s

12:35.740 --> 12:42.220
to play for you here at the last minute, and of course, we got the tapes from yesterday's

12:42.220 --> 12:45.980
Dollar Mendy tournament, and we've got those interviews we're going to be airing for you.

12:45.980 --> 12:50.920
We got that all put together at the last minute. I was a microphone hoe-er. But you got some

12:50.920 --> 12:54.680
Some great interviews, Jamie, so we're going to be hearing that about the show.

12:54.680 --> 13:00.080
We split it up into three parts, so we'll be playing a bunch of it throughout the show.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.780
I want to start off the show with something I was just given literally two minutes before

13:03.780 --> 13:04.780
we went on air.

13:04.780 --> 13:09.540
It's a link to a post over on the, I love this name for a board, the DJ Trunks Owned

13:09.540 --> 13:11.600
You board.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.960
And this is a possible Max 3 song list.

13:13.960 --> 13:19.160
I don't know the validity of it, of course I don't think any of us know at this point,

13:19.160 --> 13:30.160
When did Captain Jack do a remix to Take Me Out to the Ballgame?

13:30.160 --> 13:36.040
From what I remember, there's a Dance Mania sports album that's out now, and that's when

13:36.040 --> 13:37.680
the song's on.

13:37.680 --> 13:43.880
At least we didn't get the Baja Man with Who Let the Dogs Out, which was also on that CD.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.200
That song would have been cool for DDR.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.200
That song would have been ass for DDR.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
You are in the minority, sir.

13:48.200 --> 13:55.160
Now what I'm disappointed in is 9-1-1, I love their Friday Night song, but more than a woman,

13:55.160 --> 13:57.460
Friday Night rocks it.

13:57.460 --> 14:03.920
One interesting entry I see here, Eiffel 65 with Blue is on this list.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.000
That's one that should have been in DDR maybe three years ago.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.240
Go ahead and read off the list.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.960
Okay, I'm going to read off what I can here.

14:09.960 --> 14:15.520
We got Never End by Yoma Komawatsu, Midnight Town by the Divas, Secret Rendezvous, Baby

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
Give Me Love, those songs.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.720
Red the Fire by Scotty D, who I don't think has done anything since Drop the Bomb, correct?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.800
No, he did something on 2DX.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.800
Next, you did...

14:24.800 --> 14:28.440
Oh, he did the track with Magoo, stick around.

14:28.440 --> 14:33.200
Celtic music, Revenge vs. Desire, that's going to be very cool, as long as it doesn't sound

14:33.200 --> 14:40.800
like Enya, because Enya facilitates release, as we've said on other shows.

14:40.800 --> 14:48.080
B For You, of course, returns, hooray, with a song called Crazy Sound, which I've used

14:48.080 --> 14:50.880
to describe B For You in the past.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.280
max the xxxium

14:53.280 --> 14:58.220
i have no idea that sounds a little lame to me but maybe who knows

14:58.220 --> 14:59.660
uh...

14:59.660 --> 15:01.820
love to

15:01.820 --> 15:04.820
i don't know there's some japanese text in here i can't i can't get to

15:04.820 --> 15:08.840
unfortunately i don't think i have the text expansion

15:08.840 --> 15:13.480
uh... that's the one song that was in your mix

15:13.480 --> 15:14.400
okay cool

15:14.400 --> 15:17.100
uh... three two one stars

15:17.100 --> 15:18.100
What?

15:18.100 --> 15:22.100
If this list is true, we've got the 3-2-1 stars in there.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
That would so work.

15:24.100 --> 15:34.100
Colors, Glorious Days, A, Le More et Libre, Kiss Kiss Kiss, and Mobo Moga.

15:34.100 --> 15:38.100
Yeah, you could just say Love and Liberty.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.100
Okay.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
Le More et Le Libre.

15:41.100 --> 15:48.140
Stream, Mosque Nada, Bus Stop, Owner of A Lonely Heart, Venus, Sunshine In Our Music,

15:48.140 --> 15:57.860
New York City Boy, What's Up 2000 by DJ Nico, New York City Boy by Pet Shop Boys, and Nancy

15:57.860 --> 15:58.940
and the Boys with SOS.

15:58.940 --> 16:03.140
I wonder if that's the same Dr. Bombay SOS or if we're talking like ABBA SOS or what?

16:03.140 --> 16:06.300
If it's ABBA SOS, that would be cool.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.940
DJ Chaos with Sweet Desire and DJ Magical with Rush Hour.

16:09.940 --> 16:13.760
already in the chat room, some people think it's fake, some people think it's real. Take

16:13.760 --> 16:17.920
it for what it's worth. If that was the real thing, remember you heard it here first. If

16:17.920 --> 16:19.920
it was fake, oops, our bad, you know, blame the chat room.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.320
Well, let me just put it this way. Max the XXXM?

16:23.320 --> 16:26.420
That's the one that kind of, of course, they're saying in the chat room it's actually called

16:26.420 --> 16:29.200
Max Infinity by Sigma. I don't know.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.960
Okay, well, Max Infinity sounds better. Max XXXM is really retarded.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.680
Yeah. It's like, porno Max.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.440
It writes the short best.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.600
It's the promo for the new movie with Vin Diesel or something.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.120
God no.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.100
So there you go, possible Max 3 song list.

16:49.100 --> 16:53.240
Let's see, what else did I want to get to? We have some...

16:53.240 --> 16:58.320
Well speaking of Max 3, you know that Euro Mix 2 just came out recently,

16:58.320 --> 17:04.280
and there were some new songs on Euro Mix 2 that are assumed to be

17:04.280 --> 17:07.800
in Max 3, and I've got one of those songs that was just sent to me, and I

17:07.800 --> 17:10.320
I haven't even pulled this up myself to listen to it.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
I'm told the quality isn't the best,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.680
but we'll play a little bit of it for you here.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.720
If it's pretty good quality,

17:15.720 --> 17:16.600
we'll even play the whole thing.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.840
If it's kind of crappy quality, we won't play very much.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.680
But let's listen to it.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.800
This is Naoki featuring Polteri with Memories.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.840
Oh, God.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.720
Are you ready?

17:26.720 --> 17:27.560
Here we go!

17:27.560 --> 17:29.000
I'm keeping the mics on for this,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.040
for a live comment. No fucking Polteri, please.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.400
Okay, so far I'm digging it.

17:33.400 --> 17:49.400
Wow, it's Destiny all over again.

17:49.400 --> 17:57.400
Why can't that woman hold a key?

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
Her voice is pretty good in this, so it's not as noisy as it might be.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
Let's see if they've read it through a mixer.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
It's fun to play people singing with her.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.900
I have to let you go

18:10.900 --> 18:12.900
I just want you to know

18:12.900 --> 18:14.900
Can you hear the cheering?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.900
I have to support

18:16.900 --> 18:18.900
The one I love

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
Super performance

18:29.900 --> 18:31.400
That's a new one for you, Missy

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
Super performance

18:32.400 --> 18:33.400
I

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
You all think that's a

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
You are very good at that.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
We have some stuff for you.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
Pretty good.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.400
Let me fuck your dick.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.400
The one for love is

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
I only have to let you go.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.400
I just want you to know.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.400
I was like Polteri like Naoki's third head or something.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
Or like second head or something like that.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.400
The rumor is Polteri is giving Naoki head actually.

19:01.400 --> 19:06.400
For fights versa, that song has been lifted from like two or three other songs.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.400
Yeah, it doesn't sound that bad compared to half the other stuff.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.400
But I'd play it if it had a good step chart. I don't know.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
Yeah, I think it's going to depend on the step chart. I like it though.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.400
Compared to most of their collaborations, that's on the higher end for me.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.400
Well, she doesn't sound like total ass, so it's okay.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.400
It could have been a lot worse. It could have been, I don't know, anything else.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.400
She just can't sing very well. I'm sorry.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.560
They're commenting in the chatroom. They're not even commenting about that song. They're saying,

19:59.560 --> 20:03.440
God, the announcer got worse.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.960
You are a super performer!

20:06.960 --> 20:09.520
Alright, let's get to the first part of those interviews, shall we?

20:09.520 --> 20:13.120
Let's hear some of the interviews from Dollar Mendy's... Well, let's talk about it,

20:13.120 --> 20:16.400
because some of you guys went. I unfortunately, I really wanted to go to this tournament,

20:16.400 --> 20:17.820
but I did have some... Somebody went to Cuzar.

20:17.820 --> 20:22.040
I had some previous commitments that I had to do. Somebody went to Cuzar. So I didn't get to go.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.280
Well, let's hear it. Excuse me.

20:24.280 --> 20:29.280
He had to go run off the Q's hour with Paul over. He's stupid. He's like, oh PA is boring.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.280
We were loyal. We raped the crane machine.

20:31.280 --> 20:38.280
Yeah, me and DarkSakura. Sorry, I forgot your name for a second. No.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.280
Get out.

20:39.280 --> 20:47.280
I'm old. I'm old. Yes, in my own special way. No, I won like 15 prizes off that game and I don't know how many she won.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.280
A bunch. I was giving them away all day.

20:50.280 --> 20:55.760
But PA got kind of boring because since it was on doubles everything went twice as slow

20:56.320 --> 21:02.360
and giving everyone a qualifying practice round made it even longer and more boring.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.280
But I made it through the qualifying round.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.560
It got pretty intense once they started running through those homemade only courses though.

21:09.220 --> 21:10.240
That was pretty insane.

21:10.860 --> 21:12.160
Meanwhile, the cues are.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.800
No, no cues are.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.660
It was fun.

21:17.660 --> 21:20.940
It was fun, but when I came back, freestyle was cool.

21:20.940 --> 21:25.140
I have to say, my favorite part of the tournament had to have been Ruben's little intermission

21:25.140 --> 21:27.340
stuff in between performers.

21:27.340 --> 21:29.140
That was great.

21:29.140 --> 21:35.240
After twenty people did Spin the Disc, he did a Spin the Disc freestyle with his stop-dropping

21:35.240 --> 21:39.400
roll move halfway through the song, which was one of the highlights, along with Corey's

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
head spin.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.280
Corey's head spin was the winner of the show.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
That was awesome.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.280
There were some really good routines, but I think I can get into that a little bit later.

21:45.280 --> 21:50.200
One of the judges gave him a hundred and wrote, oh my god, head spin, and that was their card.

21:50.200 --> 21:54.200
I gave Ruben a negative sixty-nine for his routine.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.600
That's pretty cool.

21:56.600 --> 22:01.240
But in PA, just throw out some who won stuff.

22:01.240 --> 22:07.520
For PA, Jimmy came in first, and I forget who came in second, or emphasis.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
I have all of the stuff.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.920
Emphasis, Jimmy came in first, and Jazz came in third.

22:11.920 --> 22:12.920
Nope.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.560
Second was radical.

22:14.560 --> 22:20.120
I have the results right here, if you'll give me a second to pull everything up.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.280
Of course this is taken from a DDR Freak.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.420
For PA, first place, we have Emphasis, who I also noticed, I guess, is newly inducted

22:27.420 --> 22:28.420
into RTF.

22:28.420 --> 22:29.420
So, congratulations.

22:29.420 --> 22:30.420
Whatever.

22:30.420 --> 22:34.320
Second place, Radical of Ass.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.980
Third from Step Squad, we have Jazz, my Nike Neko Jazz.

22:37.980 --> 22:41.060
Fourth was Chubbs.

22:41.060 --> 22:48.260
For Group Freestyle, first place was Hypnotics and One Wish Mike or Boogaloo Shrimp I guess

22:48.260 --> 22:49.260
going by now.

22:49.260 --> 22:53.020
Second was DK Angel Wings of Step Squad and Kit Hero.

22:53.020 --> 22:58.700
Third place was Marky Mark and Tommy L. I'm just reading off the list, I'm sorry.

22:58.700 --> 23:03.540
For Comedy First Place, we have Mr. Wendell and Fancy Lala, who's his niece, that was

23:03.540 --> 23:08.980
a very, very cute routine to Cowgirl.

23:08.980 --> 23:17.340
have for single freestyle. First was Fuzzy Hat, second was Mr. Wendell, third was Rain

23:17.340 --> 23:23.980
of RTS, and fourth was DK Angel Wing's dad, who got up there and just did some amazing

23:23.980 --> 23:27.820
last minute freestyle. That was the coolest thing ever. That was probably the third coolest

23:27.820 --> 23:32.580
thing about the tournament. He just got up and started like, he was better than almost

23:32.580 --> 23:37.020
everyone else, and he made it up on the spot. That was awesome. But, you know, Fuzzy Hat's

23:37.020 --> 23:42.340
the man because he had fire. Yeah, he used candles for raving. He did, he did a really

23:42.340 --> 23:48.720
nice routine to healing vision and Wendell's was to center the heart, which I thought was

23:48.720 --> 23:53.620
very, very well presented. Very funny. Of course, I was a judge. Actually, I was going

23:53.620 --> 23:57.660
to ask you, Jamie, as a judge for the tournament, and awesome, I'm glad you got to participate

23:57.660 --> 24:01.780
in that, what did you think of the level of freestyle at this tournament compared to other

24:01.780 --> 24:06.660
tournaments you've either been to or heard about, seen videos of? I think that not everyone

24:06.660 --> 24:12.740
was really taking the tourney seriously, however, it looked like people were having fun with

24:12.740 --> 24:16.820
what they were doing and that always to me, one of the biggest things that I like to judge

24:16.820 --> 24:22.020
on is energy, the amount of enthusiasm you put into doing your performance and I have

24:22.020 --> 24:25.880
to say there was a good bit of energy in the performances.

24:25.880 --> 24:30.060
That's what happens when everyone drinks like four pitchers of beer right before.

24:30.060 --> 24:35.460
We have the other contest that was going on on the side and that's the drinking contest

24:35.460 --> 24:40.500
between Step Squad and the members of RTF that were there.

24:40.500 --> 24:45.420
I know that Mr. Wendell drank a lot because he fell over halfway through his group comedy

24:45.420 --> 24:49.600
performance for Cowgirl and that was pretty funny.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.380
We have the drinking results in 7th place.

24:52.380 --> 24:57.880
We have Iguana Girl of Step Squad, 6th place Islander, 5th place Fuzzy Hat, 4th place Mr.

24:57.880 --> 25:05.320
Wendell, 3rd Rain of RTF, 2nd place Kiyoki, and 1st place J-Connect of Step Squad.

25:05.320 --> 25:12.320
I'd also like to give a shout out to the newer members of Step Squad and to my Step Squad

25:12.320 --> 25:13.320
family.

25:13.320 --> 25:19.280
Really, it was Step Squad all over the place at the tourney and it was a lot of fun.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.160
How many beers did Jake and Edick have?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.000
Because I know Rain had about nine.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.800
All I have to say also is, wait until we get to the interviews, you're going to see just

25:27.800 --> 25:34.440
how Step Squad was all over this tourney, especially in the interviews.

25:34.440 --> 25:39.880
So I know that there were many, many pitchers of beer floating around.

25:39.880 --> 25:44.400
I do also know that apparently I'm some alcohol connoisseur because I sniffed it and could

25:44.400 --> 25:49.040
tell it was Heineken.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.840
There was a whole lot of drinking going on.

25:50.840 --> 25:57.520
I was worried for a few people and Kiyoki turned into the human billboard for the tournament.

25:57.520 --> 26:04.520
I think I signed his head somewhere and Cory signed his arm with 2DX style.

26:04.520 --> 26:10.920
I'll go ahead and give a plug for 2DXstyle.net, check it out.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.320
They have a plug for us too.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
Yes.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.320
Very cool site.

26:14.320 --> 26:20.940
It was basically, there was the impromptu wrestling out in the parking lot.

26:20.940 --> 26:27.880
We had Jay Kinetic putting Keshi in the walls of Jericho while I had to do a run-in with

26:27.880 --> 26:31.500
the orange bat of justice, trademark.

26:31.500 --> 26:36.580
The bat did get signed by just about everybody, so it's now owned.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.980
Okay, let's go to the tape.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.980
How's that sound?

26:39.980 --> 26:40.980
Sounds like winter.

26:40.980 --> 26:44.000
All right, I'm going to leave the mics hot and we can pause these interviews as we feel

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
the need to interject.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.620
Sam, this is a hot mic from my hand.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.060
All right, here we go.

26:49.060 --> 26:52.660
this is jamie live at the uh... dollar mendy tournaments which was held just

26:52.660 --> 26:56.220
yesterday on august seventeenth rob if you don't want

26:56.220 --> 26:59.140
no it's not like that started well we're gonna play it live though

26:59.140 --> 27:01.740
yeah but it's a new line like a life tape

27:01.740 --> 27:04.260
recorded it was a report that she was like

27:04.260 --> 27:05.980
here we go here's the tape

27:05.980 --> 27:10.140
hi this is that fact that i can see you live from mountain mike's income card

27:10.140 --> 27:14.660
are you what i tell you she's coming to you live

27:14.660 --> 27:17.860
august seventeenth of two thousand and two

27:17.860 --> 27:22.460
This is a series of interviews done here at the Dollar Mandy Summer Vacation Tournament

27:22.460 --> 27:24.580
for Orange Challenge Radio.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.300
And if you don't like it, too bad.

27:26.300 --> 27:30.020
So now we are to our next segment of interviews for Orange Challenge Radio now, but I don't

27:30.020 --> 27:33.260
have the pause button on the recorder, so let's go to...

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
It was...

27:34.260 --> 27:38.380
No, I have to say it was Jamie's first time, so you know, there was bound to be a few mistakes

27:38.380 --> 27:39.780
and one of them was the pause button, but that's okay.

27:39.780 --> 27:44.500
I love that though, because one of the interviews I did, I started off with Naoki Iijoji, who...

27:44.500 --> 27:50.080
Apparently, we had been trying to meet for the Sakura Batsuri in San Francisco for years

27:50.080 --> 27:54.420
and years in a row, and we finally met up at Turning, so it was cool.

27:54.420 --> 27:55.420
Oh, that's cool.

27:55.420 --> 27:56.420
Well, good for you guys.

27:56.420 --> 27:59.700
But, by the way, this is the very first...we're going to do this more and more on Orange Lounge,

27:59.700 --> 28:03.100
go out throughout the Bomani community and tape things at events, and this is kind of

28:03.100 --> 28:08.100
the first in a series of those, so Jamie did an excellent job with this.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.100
My applause to her.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.100
Well, let's listen to the rest.

28:10.100 --> 28:14.100
To our current guests, go ahead and tell everyone who you are.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.100
Give me our mic, once again.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.100
The Cockmaster.

28:19.100 --> 28:22.100
Yes, the Cockmaster.

28:22.100 --> 28:26.100
And go ahead and let everyone know what you're doing for Trini, again.

28:26.100 --> 28:31.100
Staff, and Gumby has two inches of hot dick for you.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.100
Would you like to answer this?

28:34.100 --> 28:35.100
There's something behind it.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.100
No.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.100
He said no.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.100
Okay.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.100
Yes.

28:39.100 --> 28:43.660
who were hanging out in the party room, there was a TV feed from the main room with the

28:43.660 --> 28:49.420
machine and there was a sign held up that says, two inches of hot dick for you. So that's

28:49.420 --> 28:54.340
where that's from. Is there a point to two inches of hot dick? No, it was just a sign

28:54.340 --> 29:01.820
held up in front of the camera. Okay, you crazy kids. Well. Exactly. So, I know I've

29:01.820 --> 29:05.940
asked the question again because I'm a dork and had the pause button on, but. It's okay

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
Hey, Jamie, we forgive you.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.940
Fight me.

29:07.940 --> 29:08.940
Shut up.

29:08.940 --> 29:15.940
So, um, you know, once again, who's looking to be the top server for a PA and what do

29:15.940 --> 29:17.940
you think is going to happen for Freestyle?

29:17.940 --> 29:18.940
Me, Dave.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.940
No, you suck a cock.

29:20.940 --> 29:25.300
Anyway, yeah, Jimmy, emphasis, I think he will do really well.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.940
Hey, you're here.

29:26.940 --> 29:27.940
Hola.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.380
Yes, Hugo just came in.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.380
Word.

29:30.380 --> 29:35.580
Uh, yeah, I think emphasis will probably do really well for Perfect Attack and like I

29:35.580 --> 29:41.000
I said before you don't know what's gonna happen for freestyle. There should be a good amount of routines like

29:42.040 --> 29:44.040
Yeah, DDR for God

29:44.080 --> 29:48.020
He's gonna win DDR for God. How was the DDR for God routine? Oh

29:49.280 --> 29:51.280
I don't know

29:51.900 --> 29:53.980
Oh, well what a load of crap

29:56.840 --> 30:02.860
Do you think we're gonna have any waste of time today the tournaments a waste of time itself

30:02.860 --> 30:05.620
off.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.820
And now you have it, that's it.

30:08.820 --> 30:14.020
And here we have a very special interview guest for our Orange John's radio segment.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.380
Go ahead and introduce yourself.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.380
Hi, I am the oh-so-annoyed-and-loving-life-I-want-a-girl.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.380
Oh, we love you anyway.

30:17.380 --> 30:30.220
Well, um, so what brings you here to Tourney, are you competing or watching or just laughing

30:30.220 --> 30:31.220
at everyone?

30:31.220 --> 30:33.220
I'm mostly just laughing at everyone.

30:33.220 --> 30:36.220
Who do you think is going to come out for a PA?

30:36.220 --> 30:39.220
I'm thinking it's probably going to come down to emphasis,

30:39.220 --> 30:43.220
probably emphasis Okie and Virtu.

30:43.220 --> 30:46.220
And what do you think is going to happen for a freestyle?

30:46.220 --> 30:47.220
I really have no idea.

30:47.220 --> 30:51.220
I think, somehow I think Wendell is going to come out of it as one of the top

30:51.220 --> 30:56.220
just because Wendell has this insane ability to always come out ahead.

30:56.220 --> 31:00.220
So overall, are you having a good time returning?

31:00.220 --> 31:03.800
So far I haven't had too much time to

31:03.800 --> 31:07.260
socialize, but I'm expecting to have a fun time.

31:07.260 --> 31:11.020
Had she had any drinks by this point?

31:11.020 --> 31:14.180
Not at that point. They ordered a pitcher of beer soon after.

31:14.180 --> 31:19.380
It was very yummy. Salad bars for like $3.99 rock.

31:19.380 --> 31:23.700
Alrighty, well thank you very much. Well then y'all are gonna have fun in Vegas

31:23.700 --> 31:26.100
because they got 99-cent salad bars there.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.900
and lots of alcohol.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.700
Oh, speaking of which, Jamie won't be with us next week, unfortunately,

31:30.700 --> 31:33.200
because she's, well, fortunate for her, because she's going to Vegas,

31:33.200 --> 31:34.700
but I'm fortunate for the rest of the stuff at home.

31:34.700 --> 31:37.700
I'm going to have me a warp core breach and ride the Star Trek experience.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.100
It's just going to be, I'm telling you, that's the way to do it.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.100
That's the way to do the Star Trek experience.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.700
I'm going to have a drunken nerd night.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.000
You're very welcome.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.900
I like my microphone.

31:46.900 --> 31:49.900
You seem to like that phallic symbol.

31:49.900 --> 31:53.500
Guess what? I'm being a microphone whore again.

31:53.500 --> 31:59.500
We have yet another person to interview, so go ahead and state your name for the audience.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
And you're done chewing.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.500
Can't chew, otherwise known as Kiyoki of the Step Squad.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.500
Okay. And what are you here doing, a tourney?

32:07.500 --> 32:14.500
Actually, no, I wish I was, but me and Jay, we're both on the inactive list because of injuries or what other reasons,

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
so we're both SSA and security today.

32:16.500 --> 32:22.500
Ah, cool. So what do you think of Perfect Attack so far, and who do you think will come ahead?

32:22.500 --> 32:25.500
We're having language filters, right?

32:25.500 --> 32:30.500
Our show is rated for adult content, so go ahead.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.500
Don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.500
I don't give a flying fuck till the freestyle starts.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.500
And what do you think is going to happen for freestyle?

32:38.500 --> 32:43.500
As long as there is no nasty guy stripping, I'm all for it.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
We did have Gumby's Boxers.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
Like I said, I was unable to make the tournament, and I apologize for that.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.500
I did see ass later on that afternoon, although I don't remember who it was.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.500
Oh my.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
Yeah, there was a cop right across the room.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.500
You didn't even know who it was?

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
I didn't see he was locking on.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.500
Was it a dark room?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.500
It was a nice butt, though.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
Well, well, well.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.500
I really hope for that since I'm judging. Oh my God.

33:03.500 --> 33:07.500
I personally think that everybody performing for Step Squad is just going to kick ass.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.500
You know, that's me.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.500
Oh, hell yeah. Step Squad will kick ass.

33:11.500 --> 33:15.500
So, um, overall, you know, you having a good time?

33:15.500 --> 33:17.500
Yes, yes I am.

33:17.500 --> 33:21.580
If only Hugo and Meg could finally figure out how much of what they own of me, it'd

33:21.580 --> 33:22.580
be all nice.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.660
So there's no scale yet?

33:24.660 --> 33:27.660
Well, apparently, Hugo owns my soul, Meg just owns my body.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.460
That works for me.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.260
It works perfectly fine with me that way.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.940
All right, well, we'll leave it at that.

33:32.940 --> 33:33.940
Thank you.

33:33.940 --> 33:34.940
Thank you.

33:34.940 --> 33:38.140
So this is the first of Supra interview number one.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.140
Yay.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.580
I am sitting here.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.260
Go ahead and state your name for the lovely listeners.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.260
Roberto.

33:44.260 --> 33:45.260
Radical.

33:45.260 --> 33:46.260
Cool.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.580
And so our... you're here...

33:48.580 --> 33:51.780
Does that mean, like, his first name is Ver2 and his last name is Radical?

33:51.780 --> 33:52.900
No, I can receive Radical, too.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.300
Oh, okay. Oh, you did them both at once.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.660
Sorta. It was mostly Corey, but...

33:56.660 --> 33:58.580
Oh, okay. Cool, cool.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.380
I didn't hear Bratical. I heard Radical.

34:01.380 --> 34:02.820
Like, that was his last name.

34:02.820 --> 34:06.100
Like, the Radical Ver2!

34:06.100 --> 34:07.700
The 80s are making a comeback, you know.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.220
So what are you doing for the tourney today?

34:10.220 --> 34:12.060
I'm doing PA.

34:12.060 --> 34:13.180
Anything else?

34:13.180 --> 34:15.740
Um... PA?

34:15.740 --> 34:17.740
Cool, and how did you do?

34:17.740 --> 34:19.740
Okay, beat me by two.

34:19.740 --> 34:21.740
But you qualified, right?

34:21.740 --> 34:22.740
Yeah.

34:22.740 --> 34:31.740
Cool, so just give us a little bit of your Bimani history and what you might be well known for even though probably everybody already knows.

34:31.740 --> 34:38.740
I started playing Bimani back in 99 with the good old BeatMania Complete Mix 1.

34:38.740 --> 34:41.740
Yeah, it's a very quick master up in this piece.

34:41.740 --> 34:44.740
And then I played DDR, it was lame.

34:44.740 --> 34:48.740
Then I got bored with BeatMania, then I went back to DDR, and I was like, wow, this is pretty cool.

34:48.740 --> 34:54.740
And I took it like an ass for two years. Took it like an ass, in the ass, however you want to put it.

34:54.740 --> 35:05.740
And then, here I am now. Big name that I don't want to be. Yeah, he's taking my place.

35:05.740 --> 35:08.740
Do you care to comment on that?

35:08.740 --> 35:09.740
About what?

35:09.740 --> 35:11.740
About taking his place.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.740
I feel honored.

35:13.740 --> 35:20.740
Who do you think is going to come out ahead for Freestyle today?

35:20.740 --> 35:26.740
Come out ahead? Call me stupid for saying this.

35:26.740 --> 35:31.740
Probably one of the RTF peeps. If Tran comes, he's pretty strong and everything.

35:31.740 --> 35:36.740
Mel maybe. I don't know. I'll see what RTF has in store.

35:36.740 --> 35:39.740
If anyone from Ass comes, they got it in the pocket too.

35:39.740 --> 35:43.260
I don't know, I might pull something out of my ass and make an ass of myself like I do

35:43.260 --> 35:44.260
all the time.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.260
Corey, yes, please.

35:45.260 --> 35:48.180
Oh, there's that comedy section too.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.380
Yeah, that's right.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.980
I might pull out another burning key.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.560
Wow, Brad just got blammed.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.560
That's pretty harsh.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.420
Can somebody explain to me what a blam is?

35:58.420 --> 36:01.740
It beats the heck out of me.

36:01.740 --> 36:02.740
Okay.

36:02.740 --> 36:06.960
I'm hearing some interesting noises coming from the side that I'm not going to comment

36:06.960 --> 36:07.960
on.

36:07.960 --> 36:13.880
So, do you have any final words that you want to say for our listeners?

36:13.880 --> 36:20.280
I'm not that special, quit making me something special, I play a game, I pass a song, whoop-de-doo.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.280
And there you have it.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.280
Oh my God, it was first time out!

36:23.280 --> 36:29.260
So, you have now yet another interview, so go ahead and state your name for our beautiful

36:29.260 --> 36:31.760
and talented listeners.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.440
My name is Mr. Wendell.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.240
I am part of the staff.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.560
How many beers by this point?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.080
I don't think any yet.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.400
You've got to be kidding me.

36:42.400 --> 36:48.880
He was outside guarding the people who had to be hid away for PA.

36:48.880 --> 36:52.440
That's the reason he could keep up that act the whole time is because he had influence.

36:52.440 --> 36:58.080
If he had been drinking a lot later, and he can really chug fast, I saw.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.160
Wendell is the beer master.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.160
Was he like that beer guy on the man show?

37:02.160 --> 37:07.160
He's not quite like the fox, but he's pretty fast.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.160
Alrighty then, let's hear what else Wendell has to say here.

37:10.160 --> 37:16.160
For the Dollar Mandy summer vacation.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.160
That reminds me, did Dollar Mandy ever make an appearance?

37:19.160 --> 37:20.160
Because he was supposedly in town.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
No, he didn't.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
What a bummer.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.160
Just staffing today and not competing, or are you competing?

37:25.160 --> 37:30.160
I'm also competing.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.160
And you're doing what say?

37:32.160 --> 37:46.160
I am doing single freestyle, and comedy.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.160
Ah.

37:48.160 --> 37:52.160
So, what do you think is going to happen so far for Trudy today?

37:52.160 --> 37:54.160
Who do you see coming ahead for a perfect attack?

37:54.160 --> 37:58.160
and who do you think is going to be your fierce competition for freestyle?

37:58.160 --> 38:04.160
Well, there's a lot of really good double freestylers that, well, double PAers, I should say.

38:04.160 --> 38:10.160
I mean, right now I have in my jail this little twerk by the name of Emphasis.

38:10.160 --> 38:17.160
You know, he kind of like beat me during the Royal Rumble, and I had to like give him a pile driver, you know.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.160
I had witnesses for that, but he's a really good kid.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.160
He can do doubles pretty good.

38:23.160 --> 38:28.160
There's another little kid by the name of Minetki-Nek, a jazz.

38:28.160 --> 38:32.160
He's kind of like tall. He's red-headed.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.160
He looks like a monster, but he's like a teddy bear.

38:36.160 --> 38:44.160
And we also have that wacky little guy by the name of Okie, Okimoto.

38:44.160 --> 38:48.160
Yeah, that boy is good.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.160
Who do you think is going to be your composition in freestyle?

38:51.160 --> 38:59.160
Well there's a lot of really good competitors. I see a lot of really good free-stylers.

38:59.160 --> 39:06.160
You have like that Hypnotics dude. He's got that Darren's groove thing going.

39:06.160 --> 39:20.160
I also see that Fuzzy guy, Fuzzy Torso, or whatever he's got Fuzzy on him.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.160
I don't know, you know, that's not my thing.

39:23.160 --> 39:31.160
We also have the crazy, wacky players, and yeah, they're going to be really, really good.

39:31.160 --> 39:37.720
good. There's so many right there that are really, really good and I can't say that I

39:37.720 --> 39:40.520
have much competition for them, but I'll do my best.

39:40.520 --> 39:44.120
I think you'll do a good job besides that Step Squad owns.

39:44.120 --> 39:51.120
Well, well, well, we represent, Step Squad is a good organization. It's really all about

39:51.120 --> 40:02.080
all about family. We do our best to promote peace in the community. We go out there and

40:02.080 --> 40:06.380
promote the freestyle, make sure that nobody does them hand slaps, do them D-drops, bump

40:06.380 --> 40:13.540
their head on the floor like I used to do back in the day. We try to have fun and make

40:13.540 --> 40:18.620
it an entertaining scene when we do tournaments and just have fun.

40:18.620 --> 40:20.620
So you're having a good time so far?

40:20.620 --> 40:24.620
I'm having a very awesome, entertaining time right now.

40:24.620 --> 40:28.620
Even though I'm kind of like running staff and running this little jail right here, you know.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.620
I have my big old fan, you know, guys try to escape.

40:31.620 --> 40:35.620
I have the Wilson butt, but, you know, I'm having a wonderful time

40:35.620 --> 40:38.620
and I expect to have a lot more fun times when the freestyle starts.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
All right, well thank you very much.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.620
The pleasure is all mine.

40:42.620 --> 40:44.620
Okay, more interviews, yay.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.620
So go ahead and state your name for our beautiful listeners.

40:47.620 --> 40:49.620
Ben.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.620
Hi.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.620
What's Ben's online name?

40:53.620 --> 40:55.620
I couldn't remember right now.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.620
It sounded like Chub's, was it Chub's?

40:57.620 --> 40:59.620
Yeah it was.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.620
For a moment my brain was totally flipping.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.620
That's what I thought.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.620
I heard this before the show and it was never made clear so I thought we'd state that.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.620
What are you doing here at the tournament today?

41:07.620 --> 41:15.620
I'm competing in Perfect Attack and I'm part of the staff, moving machines, kicking people out and stuff.

41:15.620 --> 41:18.620
Sounds like grueling work.

41:18.620 --> 41:20.620
It's free pizza.

41:20.620 --> 41:22.620
That's always a good reason.

41:22.620 --> 41:25.620
So what do you foresee happening for a perfect attack today?

41:25.620 --> 41:27.620
Who do you think is going to come ahead?

41:27.620 --> 41:30.620
I think Okie will sweep.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.620
That's what you're talking about.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.620
Okie is going to win first.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.620
Corey is going to fail.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.620
I see.

41:37.620 --> 41:41.620
And what do you see happening for a freestyle later today?

41:41.620 --> 41:54.620
I haven't really looked over the list, but I'm pretty sure Fuzzy Hat will come up as some improv, Hypnotics might win, and Kyle Snyder will entertain himself.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.620
But Kyle Snyder never shows.

41:55.620 --> 41:57.620
Indeed.

41:57.620 --> 42:03.620
So just to go ahead and give everyone a little bit of history, what's your history in the Bemani scene?

42:03.620 --> 42:08.620
Well, I've been playing at the boardwalk three years ago, two and a half.

42:08.620 --> 42:13.620
My first big tournament was March Madness, which is about six months ago.

42:13.620 --> 42:17.620
Until then, I've been at every tournament, pretty much, since March Madness.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.620
All right, well, thank you for the interview.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.620
No problem.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.620
More interviews, yay.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.620
Yay.

42:24.620 --> 42:28.620
I got another person to interview, so go ahead and for our listeners,

42:28.620 --> 42:32.620
state your name and your brief history in the Milwaukee community.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.620
What's your favorite color?

42:33.620 --> 42:36.620
My brief history and a big money community.

42:36.620 --> 42:39.620
It's a community?

42:39.620 --> 42:41.620
More like a commune.

42:41.620 --> 42:44.620
Yeah, a communist party.

42:44.620 --> 42:45.620
Let's see.

42:45.620 --> 42:46.620
I'll tell you what it's more like.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.620
You ever hear about Waco?

42:48.620 --> 42:53.620
It's a big inbred party.

42:53.620 --> 42:56.620
Somebody got a bus.

42:56.620 --> 42:57.620
Let's see.

42:57.620 --> 43:15.620
I have a brother named STI, one of the three original founders of StepSquad, other than me, Jay Kinetic, and Strider Vegeta, aka Strizzy.

43:15.620 --> 43:25.620
Let's see, I've entered too many tournaments to count and just now I've actually taken

43:25.620 --> 43:32.380
it seriously on freestyling, so instead of just half-assing everything I might as well

43:32.380 --> 43:38.380
do a routine, so last time I got a routine but I failed the song, oh well, giving another

43:38.380 --> 43:41.180
shot again, so that's why I'm here.

43:41.180 --> 43:45.700
What do you think of your competition for freestyle today?

43:45.700 --> 43:50.900
The dudes from ass is like really good and I think there's like two other people that

43:50.900 --> 43:54.420
are doing the same song I am.

43:54.420 --> 44:00.500
I've been practicing it today but I've been moving alright.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.980
I don't know man.

44:01.980 --> 44:03.780
Wendell is cool.

44:03.780 --> 44:11.740
I don't consider them competition, so I don't care how high I place or whatever, and I don't

44:11.740 --> 44:16.180
even care about placing, I'm just trying to have fun, do what I'm supposed to do, and

44:16.180 --> 44:18.380
entertain people.

44:18.380 --> 44:21.340
That sounds like a really good philosophy to have.

44:21.340 --> 44:27.500
I've noticed that some people get really, really heavy on the competition, on the have

44:27.500 --> 44:28.500
to be better aspect.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.100
I mean, what do you think of that kind of attitude?

44:31.100 --> 44:36.860
Yeah, it's like, I had this mentality, it's like, oh man, I have to place top five and

44:36.860 --> 44:41.380
I never end up doing it. So it's just like, you know, forget it. I'm just going to do

44:41.380 --> 44:48.700
what I want to do, just dance and just entertain people, just show off some dance moves, whatever.

44:48.700 --> 44:53.500
I don't know. I'm just going to go do my thing. I don't care if people don't like it or whatever.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.900
As long as I have fun out there and I feel okay.

44:55.900 --> 44:59.660
Do you have a final word for the listeners?

44:59.660 --> 45:00.660
Yeah.

45:00.660 --> 45:01.660
Word.

45:01.660 --> 45:02.660
Indeed.

45:02.660 --> 45:03.660
Thank you.

45:03.660 --> 45:04.660
All right.

45:04.660 --> 45:12.540
That's it for the first round of interviews there from Dollar Mindy's summer vacation.

45:12.540 --> 45:13.940
And it was quite fun.

45:13.940 --> 45:14.940
Yes.

45:14.940 --> 45:15.940
What did you think of that?

45:15.940 --> 45:18.140
Good group of people to interview there.

45:18.140 --> 45:20.180
They're all very good about it.

45:20.180 --> 45:25.620
I want to thank you all for putting up with me, shoving a microphone up your nose or anything.

45:25.620 --> 45:27.740
No complete drunks yet, but...

45:27.740 --> 45:29.700
Not yet, but we get them later.

45:29.700 --> 45:32.580
But we do have more sets of interviews coming a little later in the show.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.300
There's a great interview with Jahi in the second set of interviews.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.620
Oh, that was fun.

45:36.620 --> 45:39.900
And in the last set of interviews, you've got Dark Sound.

45:39.900 --> 45:44.260
You're interviewing him, the master of the tournament, and the reason why the webcast

45:44.260 --> 45:47.140
on DDR4E didn't end up happening.

45:47.140 --> 45:50.740
So for those of you that were curious about what happened there, he gives the explanation.

45:50.740 --> 45:51.740
It's all there.

45:51.740 --> 45:53.140
We're going to play that for you a little later in the show.

45:53.140 --> 45:57.540
In the meantime, if you weren't listening to the show a little bit earlier, we played

45:57.540 --> 46:02.620
for you Memories, the new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song, and that was given to me

46:02.620 --> 46:08.420
from our chatroom comedian Pyroman, and I promised him since I played that that I would

46:08.420 --> 46:09.420
play Destiny.

46:09.420 --> 46:10.840
So I will play Destiny.

46:10.840 --> 46:16.140
Right after Destiny, we've got two brand new 8th Style songs we're going to premiere for

46:16.140 --> 46:17.220
you right here.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.620
Vir2 from 2DX Style, big thank you to him.

46:19.620 --> 46:26.380
Go ahead and visit 2dxstyle.net for all the latest and greatest 2DX news, if you haven't

46:26.380 --> 46:27.380
already.

46:27.380 --> 46:31.800
And we're going to hear some new stuff from 8th Style thanks to those guys there.

46:31.800 --> 46:35.460
So let's first hear Destiny and then we'll get to the 8th Style stuff here on Orange

46:35.460 --> 46:36.460
Lounge Radio.

46:36.460 --> 47:01.680
go.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.180
I'm just a kind of person

47:04.180 --> 47:08.680
And I'm not a part of no other thing

47:08.680 --> 47:11.680
And I'm not lying to no one

47:11.680 --> 47:14.680
And I'm not a thing

47:14.680 --> 47:17.680
I'm not a thing

47:17.680 --> 47:21.680
That's the way I dream and dream

47:21.680 --> 47:25.680
I know I just can't just take you free

47:25.680 --> 47:35.680
I used to keep on following you, never letting you go

47:35.680 --> 47:39.680
Following you all day, all night, I'm calling on you

47:39.680 --> 47:43.680
Never letting you go, I'm following you

47:43.680 --> 47:48.680
You, you were the destiny

47:48.680 --> 47:52.680
I was getting what we had to do

47:52.680 --> 48:19.860
All right, as promised, here we go with some new eighth style tracks.

48:19.860 --> 48:21.820
This first one is DJ Taka with M.

48:21.820 --> 48:23.520
And by the way, this is the first time I will have even

48:23.520 --> 48:24.320
heard these.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.640
Any of us in the room will have heard these live here on

48:26.640 --> 48:27.600
Orange Lounge Radio.

48:27.600 --> 48:32.040
From 8th Style, DJ Taka with M.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
Oh

50:02.040 --> 50:23.720
From 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio, that was DJ Taco with M. Big thanks to the

50:23.720 --> 50:29.960
folks at 2dxstyle.net and 2dxstyle.com. They both work now. And they've been yelling at

50:29.960 --> 50:32.660
because I haven't been saying.com. I guess that's how they're going to promote it now,

50:32.660 --> 50:37.920
although it was.net, but whatever. Anyway, we were thinking, it sounds a lot like V,

50:37.920 --> 50:45.160
doesn't it, that song? That song is ass, okay? That was crap. What the hell is he doing?

50:45.160 --> 50:50.120
I'm going to take a classical piano piece and add a beat to it. Oh, gee, why don't you

50:50.120 --> 50:54.600
just throw in Polteri into there, too? That'd be even better. That would make it suck. Chat

50:54.600 --> 50:58.960
Room is racking their brains trying to figure out what original piece that's based off of.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.800
Bradley thinks he has it figured out, why don't you tell him?

51:01.800 --> 51:04.160
It's from Moonlight Sonata by Bach.

51:04.160 --> 51:08.200
Moonlight Sonata by Bach is what we believe that to be based off of, so

51:08.200 --> 51:12.440
we'll have to go download the original and see if we can match it up, see if it works out.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.720
Although that would make sense, M for Moonlight Sonata, but maybe M is for

51:16.720 --> 51:19.640
Mozart Suggested Chat Room, so who knows?

51:19.640 --> 51:21.320
Anyway, we're gonna...

51:21.320 --> 51:23.920
V was for Vivaldi, so that would make sense.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.600
So, who knows?

51:25.600 --> 51:32.600
We'll play this next track for you from 8th Style Preview, DJW with Gemini.

51:55.600 --> 51:57.600
Oh

52:55.600 --> 53:25.500
That's DJW with Gemini, and we do believe the category for that will be

53:25.500 --> 53:30.420
the elevator music dot that was awful i'm sorry that mom is it

53:30.420 --> 53:33.860
makes you want to take a nap or go shopping or something i i don't like it

53:33.860 --> 53:37.380
that's just my opinion your knowledge on satellite preferred and much more to that

53:37.380 --> 53:42.340
uh... i i disagree with low-key i'd kind of dug him it was cool i like that whole

53:42.340 --> 53:44.580
classical remake thing but

53:44.580 --> 53:47.140
they he doesn't need to kind of reinvented it's kind of been done we've

53:47.140 --> 53:49.380
had the we've had a cochran

53:49.380 --> 53:50.400
it's time okay

53:50.400 --> 53:54.580
and better be the last one it needs to go in a different direction

53:54.580 --> 54:02.580
Well, it's not that I don't like that genre of music. I mean, piano ambient is awesome, but it's just he didn't do anything with it. He just added a beat to it.

54:02.580 --> 54:08.580
I mean, do a little bit more than just add a beat to the music, because it's really old. That's all.

54:08.580 --> 54:10.580
Quite.

54:10.580 --> 54:20.580
Well, I'm kind of wanting things to go back to sort of old school, how the songs used to be in Beatmania. I want 5-key style stuff, you know.

54:20.580 --> 54:26.260
Well, really, the other tracks that we've heard recently, to me they sound like a lot

54:26.260 --> 54:27.260
of the Five Key stuff.

54:27.260 --> 54:30.080
I think 8th Style is going to be a very Five Key kind of game.

54:30.080 --> 54:31.580
That's kind of what it's sounding like to me.

54:31.580 --> 54:36.300
Well, I mean, obviously it's not a Five Key game, but with that same style of music, especially

54:36.300 --> 54:39.860
with a lot of the artists coming over from the Five Key series, since Five Key isn't

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
going to exist anymore.

54:40.860 --> 54:41.860
I miss Five Key.

54:41.860 --> 54:42.860
I miss it already.

54:42.860 --> 54:50.040
Anyway, I'm going to play one more song for you, just because I've got to pee soon here.

54:50.040 --> 54:58.300
We're going to play something else from Euromix 2 that's one of the supposed max 3 new songs.

54:58.300 --> 55:02.760
This is Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band here on Orange Lounge Radio

55:02.760 --> 55:16.240
I'm going to go my way, get with me your mother, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, break the dollar,

55:16.240 --> 55:25.240
get out of here, come with me now, now we are going our way, I wanna show you baby,

55:25.240 --> 55:27.240
The world you've never seen

55:27.240 --> 55:29.240
Nothing can stop us now

55:29.240 --> 55:32.240
So hold on tight, babe

55:32.240 --> 55:34.240
So I will out there

55:34.240 --> 55:36.240
When you come, open your eyes

55:36.240 --> 55:38.240
Don't need to be afraid

55:38.240 --> 55:41.240
Stay with me, baby

55:41.240 --> 55:43.240
You are the one

55:43.240 --> 55:45.240
To keep me sane

55:45.240 --> 55:48.240
Baby, take my hand

55:48.240 --> 55:50.240
And love me now

55:52.240 --> 55:54.240
I don't wanna know

55:54.240 --> 56:01.240
But they say, no, no, I don't care They can't tell me nothing, I'm gonna go my way

56:01.240 --> 56:06.240
One, two, three, four, five, race it, darlin', get out of here

56:06.240 --> 56:11.240
Come with me now, now we are going our way

56:11.240 --> 56:18.240
Come on! Go on, you bummer boys! Let's go!

56:18.240 --> 56:30.240
Now, I don't wanna know which way it goes Just keep on going, there is no time No time to be wasted now

56:30.240 --> 56:40.240
One, two, three, four, five Now is the time, let's get out of here Come with me now Nothing can ever stop us

56:40.240 --> 56:56.880
From the steps-wide to orange paths, this GDR sucks, holler, stop, stop, stop, stop,

56:56.880 --> 57:05.840
we want our slimmers, exercise, PS, all right, TTPO.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.960
our thoughts on the uh... mister brian in the final band with crash from your

57:09.960 --> 57:14.260
own it's not fucking sucked that was the biggest bit of aspects of the guitar

57:14.260 --> 57:14.920
school

57:14.920 --> 57:18.560
through the japanese singer and throw in a kindergartener it sounds like an old

57:18.560 --> 57:20.640
man seen crappy lyrics

57:20.640 --> 57:25.120
or any town lyrics by no missus kimball's

57:25.120 --> 57:26.800
kindergarten class sung by

57:26.800 --> 57:30.920
this stupid guy that's really what it is just crap let's take a crappy song and

57:30.920 --> 57:34.600
add a crappy guy to it and will get some more crap

57:34.600 --> 57:39.640
while they just made another uh... i know that he could sing firefly to

57:39.640 --> 57:41.800
or and you know why not think died

57:41.800 --> 57:44.920
i'm sure his voice it's not awesome on dot

57:44.920 --> 57:47.560
for true you know he'd be good for true

57:47.560 --> 57:51.720
according to the chat room it's white guys try to do break down in english

57:51.720 --> 57:53.000
so anyway um...

57:53.000 --> 57:56.440
while that was really bad so um...

57:56.440 --> 57:59.120
on behalf of orange lounge radio

57:59.120 --> 58:00.000
on behalf of

58:00.000 --> 58:02.160
the lovely dark sacra co-host

58:02.160 --> 58:07.220
On behalf of myself, Sky, co-host, I would like to offer an apology for wasting one minute

58:07.220 --> 58:11.940
and forty-four seconds of your life with that utter piece of crap song that is known as

58:11.940 --> 58:14.340
Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

58:14.340 --> 58:17.940
Will you please ever forgive us for that?

58:17.940 --> 58:21.980
Send us money if you do.

58:21.980 --> 58:26.060
Money can be sent to, you know, Jamie Summerscare over.

58:26.060 --> 58:31.220
Do I smell, yeah, DDR Max USA exclusive track-

58:31.220 --> 58:42.220
Oh wait, now it wouldn't be exclusive. New original for DDR Max USA though. I can just see it right now. It smells like the festering pile of shit that DDR Max USA will probably become.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.220
Maybe not.

58:43.220 --> 58:49.220
No, maybe not. Let's give it a chance. Let's at least see the song list before we bash it because right now it sounded pretty darn good.

58:49.220 --> 58:50.220
Yeah.

58:50.220 --> 58:54.220
We just gotta see the song list and then we can, you know, be as critical as all hell.

58:54.220 --> 58:56.220
Breakdown.

58:56.220 --> 59:00.620
Um, damn it, there was something else I wanted to play here, but I forget what it was.

59:00.620 --> 59:04.300
My, my, I got all back-ass-ward here.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.740
What do we want to talk about next? I want to do my Fuck You of the Week. Oh yeah, that's what we want to do.

59:08.740 --> 59:11.140
We want to do the Fuck You of the Week. Let's, uh, get to Jamie's

59:11.140 --> 59:15.420
Fuck You of the Week. For those that are new to the show, Jamie likes every week, and I

59:15.420 --> 59:17.820
sometimes do too, and I do have a Fuck You this week, by the way.

59:17.820 --> 59:21.740
But Jamie likes, and so does Matt, uh, Jamie likes to

59:21.740 --> 59:25.340
get all pissed off at something every week, and we call it Jamie's Fuck You of

59:25.340 --> 59:30.720
the week segment she's in ornery she's not always the sweet innocent moderator

59:30.720 --> 59:44.020
that you might think she is okay so let's get to Jamie's f you of the week

59:44.020 --> 59:50.020
Okay, my Fuck You of the Week goes to...

59:50.020 --> 59:54.020
I forgot where my Fuck You of the Week is going to be.

59:54.020 --> 59:57.020
Oh, yes! Fucking fantasy!

59:57.020 --> 59:59.020
In, like, seven of all things.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:06.020
Okay, I've been, you know, Iguana Girl has been very nice to let me, you know, trade out my fifth style with her to play fourth style,

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:11.020
so I've been, I said, I'm gonna, you know, finally beat fantasy and pass that back,

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:19.620
because, you know, I haven't been playing 2DX that long, and I've always been slow with, you know, picking up some of the stuff from the Ronnie games,

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.020
although, once I learn something, I really don't forget it.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:33.320
Um, so I've been struggling with fantasy, and I've been getting 72, 76, 78, 78, 78, 78, every damn time I play the song,

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:38.720
so I want my fucking border bonus, and it's about goddamn time that I get it, and then I can give it back.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:55.720
Although on a good note, I did finally pass a check or two, and I am probably about a couple weeks away from having my first 7-star beaten to the voltage or Y31.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.120
having any pepsi blue in stock today

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.040
assistant

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.400
it's it's a good dessert drink for me just let me have my fun

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.640
it's good shit

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.480
someone eight of them two strawberries and cotton candy and puked it into a jar

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.760
well regardless

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.560
walgreens did not carry the puke in the jar that i happen to like so big fuck

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.960
you to walgreens

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.220
mad you haven't fucked you in a week

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.460
yes i do

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:36.520
my f you the week

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.560
i had to give you a song i'm sorry

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.160
i hate this song

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.300
my a few of the week goes to the conquered city planners

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.120
what the hell were you thinking with the streets

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.120
streets are supposed to have perpendicular intersections okay this crap of winding

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.200
streets that you have in there is just

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.400
unnecessary i got lost about four times in conquered and it should have been really simple

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.880
how did i add that was on the same road

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.120
yes it was on the same damn roads

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.540
i feel like it was stratton or something like that

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.560
it was just pathetic

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:16.560
It's pathetic. This road makes three different turns and they have streets intersecting with it. It's crap. So, my F.U. goes out to them.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.560
It's raining. Hallelujah.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.560
Our chat room has some F.U.s of the week they want to dish out, so let me get to those.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.560
SoCalKick says, F.U. GenomScream for not going to Power Station and F.U. DJ Ness for leaving early.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:38.560
And fuck you Pepsi Blue for making me sick and having a crappy cap that's spilled on the cam I borrowed and it spilled on it and fucked the cam up, whatever that means.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Pyro Man, our local chatroom comedian, would like to give a big fuck you to the live 365 lady that comes up whenever he tries to start the stream and it ends up delaying his stream by two minutes.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560
So, a big F you by them.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.560
And that's our Fuck You of the Week. Good job, everybody.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.760
I feel the leak goes toward Propel, put out by Gatorade.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:04.480
This beautiful fitness water tastes like Ghetto Kool-Aid and owns you for free.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.120
Let's get to the second part of the Daler-Mendy interview, shall we?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
We shall.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120
We shall.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120
Here we go.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.520
More of Jamie live doing interviews at the Daler-Mendy tournament, which was just yesterday.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.680
Yes, it was.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.960
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
All day.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.960
I'm doing more interviews.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.660
doing more interviews. Anyway, go ahead and state for our listeners your name and a little

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.580
bit of your history in the Badminton community.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, I'm Hattori Hanzo and I've been in the DDR community for about two years now. I remember

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.560
starting out when we had some valley mall out here in Concord on a USA mix machine and

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.900
everybody's fan favorite Orochi would come and play all the time and would just scare

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:55.780
everyone off the pad, which is okay. We finally figured out how to play and we decided to

01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:04.660
go along with it. I met people like Wendell and Shadow Me Twice and Drakonas over at the

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.400
mall and we became good friends once we got a machine over here at Mountain Mikes. From

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.900
there it's just been a tournament, hanging out, having fun, just trying to do what we

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:25.820
do then lately I just joined step squad with the with Wendell and the dark

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:31.860
Takumi there yeah it's pretty much what's really going on right now so

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:38.620
that's about it so what's your plans for the attorney today well I'm judging

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:43.240
freestyle today because I don't play doubles so perfect attack is pretty dumb

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:50.360
for me right now, and I really can't freestyle, so I decided to just be a judge, and that'll

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360
be it.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.200
Who do you think is going to come out on top for our freestyle today?

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Freestyle?

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200
I don't know.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.960
There's some pretty good people out there.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:05.400
I know there's Wendell, and he got Takumi coming up with something, and then we got

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.400
Fuzzy.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.480
He's got some good names out there, so I can't really tell.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.480
Overall, what's your opinion of the Baymani community as it is right now?

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:29.480
Well, lately it's becoming more and more, quote-unquote, scrubby-fied with all these newbies trying to act like they know what they're talking about without asking questions beforehand.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:38.420
So I'm one of the quote unquote old school people and respect is still there but these

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:45.080
newbies coming up they need to either just sit there and watch what's going on or ask

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.840
sensible questions because this immaturity is just not working.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:55.240
So do you have any final thoughts or words that you want to leave with the listeners?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:02.340
All I got to say is, Step Squad for life works.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.980
And I'm going to go ahead and add my personal note that I totally 100% agree because Step

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980
Squad owns.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980
Thank you.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.980
You're welcome.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.580
And we have more interview fun.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580
Yay!

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.520
So go ahead and for our listeners, go ahead and state your name and your history with

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.620
the Bemani community.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.620
Let's see.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:23.220
I'm ShadowMeTwice and I like playing DDR.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:31.340
I've been playing DDR for like two years, and yeah.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.620
That sounds absolutely awesome.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.700
So what is your participation with the tournament today?

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.860
Are you competing or moral support or immoral support?

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.060
Well, I guess I'm just here for moral support, hanging out.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.460
And if Dark Sound lets me, I might

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.020
do my little old school routine from back in the day.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:55.020
Otherwise, I'm just going to stand and hang out and yeah.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.140
That sounds pretty groovy.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.660
So what do you think of the competition so far?

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.620
How do you think things are going?

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.180
Well, I don't know too much about PA,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.780
but it looks pretty good.

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.500
I know I see some pretty good people here, like Virtu.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.860
And I know Mananako Jazz is here.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.340
So he's good stuff.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.900
I'm waiting for that freestyle, though.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.940
And I'm wondering if the webcam is working.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.620
And I'll have to check on the cam.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.620
But for last I heard, I think that everything

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.780
is supposed to be a go.

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.300
So do you have any final words for the Baymani community

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.860
or for our listeners or anything?

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:38.020
Yes, keep on playing the DDR and the Baymani.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.620
Thank you.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.040
Hi, go ahead and state your name and involvement

01:07:44.040 --> 01:08:10.040
What's your participation in the tournament today?

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:16.040
Well, I just got to the second round and I was first in qualifying.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.040
That's for Perfect Attack?

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Yes.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.040
Are you doing a freestyle at all?

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040
No.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.040
So who do you think is your strongest competition in Perfect Attack?

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.040
Basically Okie because his scores in doubles only are insane.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040
Okay.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.040
So what's your view of the Bimani community as it is today?

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040
It's getting worse.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.040
Like in what way?

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:46.040
More, it's just too much, as you say, drama.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040
Drama sucks.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.040
So, do you have any final words for the listeners?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:00.040
Freestyle takes creativity, PA takes nothing. That's why I PA.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Thank you.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.040
What's with all this hate for PA today?

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.040
It's really boring.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.040
It was long.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.360
Yeah, very long, like six hours.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.520
It's about as exciting as golf is.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.680
There will be a tournament one day with exciting PA.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680
I guarantee it.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.160
I'm telling you, when they start doing the trivia questions mixed in with PA and start

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.820
beating people with bats when they get questions wrong, that will be the day.

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.760
It is something I would like to do for the next PA if we do a tournament here in Sacramento,

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.440
which, by the way, we are trying to plan.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.200
We'll have details on that for you as soon as we get them.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Nice little distant plug there.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.020
And now back to the interviews.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.140
This is around 20 million for the interviews.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:44.740
Go ahead and state your name and your history in the Baymani community for listeners.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.100
I'm Paulo Sambrano.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.500
I go in the DDR community as Rock My Socks Off, and in the Poetry Slam community I'm

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500
known as the Freaky Funky Space Monkey.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.080
Isn't that a flavor of Ben and Jerry's?

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.820
I have no idea, but this guy was cool.

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.820
Alright, he sounds pretty cool.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.340
And I've been involved in the Baynominee scene for about two years, although I've been playing

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.980
DDR for about a year and three months now.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:11.100
So are you here competing or in moral support observing?

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:16.100
Actually it's really funny you bring that up because I'm doing a documentary about DDR

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:22.540
in the Bay Area, no Calcine and let's see, I didn't pre-register, I don't have a tripod

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.140
but I have a camera and the only way that Ruben or Dark Sound is going to let me get

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.900
in the actual pit area where all the freestyle action is going to go down, so I actually

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.580
register under freestyle, I suppose.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.700
So I'm probably just going to register under freestyle and own the waste of time bracket

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.180
just for the hell of it.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:48.500
And who do you think is going to be your number one competition in the waste of time bracket?

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.500
I don't know.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.740
All I know is I'm going to own it, let's just put it that way.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.740
How's that for an honest answer?

01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.440
So what's your view on the Baymani community so far, especially in regards to that documentary

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.440
you're doing?

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.360
It's hard to say actually, because from what I could observe in the SF scene, it was really

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.800
going down, then it was going up, with the whole Rise of Riptide arcade as being hailed

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:18.280
as the golf land of SF, but I would have to say there's a lot less, I'm not sure, from

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.560
what I could tell, unity in the community for some right now, because there's a lot

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.960
of like, I don't know, disenchantment, I suppose, and a lot of noobs getting in the community.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.840
I'm not saying that's a bad thing, because we were all noobs, but it's a lot of cocky

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.720
noobs and a lot of cynicism from the old schoolers, so that's what my take on it.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:41.080
Would you have any advice for new players or just, you know, for the listeners in general?

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.280
Any final words?

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.800
Advice-wise, to put it this way, I'm still a noob, although, I don't know, different

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:59.360
standards, but just keep doing it. Keep trying. Fuck what everyone else has to say. Just do

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.600
it because you love it, not because everyone else is telling you to do it. People call

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.440
you a noob or a lamer. Fuck it because we're all noobs and lammers. They're just small

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:16.380
dicks so they just need some sort of instant gratification. And last words, yeah, my doc

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:25.380
The box is going to be out later this year. Come see it. I'm going to sell it to PBS and become moderately famous. Thanks a lot.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:32.380
I like how he says he's not going to be famous. He's just going to be moderately famous, like a local celebrity.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:41.380
Moderately famous like the woman, the British woman that insults everyone. I forget what show it's called.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.380
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.380
That one.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.380
He'll be more famous than that for a DDR documentary.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.380
It's moderately famous because I don't know her name.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:56.380
And something. Damn it, now it's going to kill me all day.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.380
My point exactly.

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.380
Shit! Alright, back to the interviews.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.380
Thank you.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.380
And now we have more witty words of wisdom.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.380
I dance to heal the world.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:13.380
It's like a performance artist. I don't want to be brash, but I think I'm the dandy...

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.380
What the fuck was that artist's name? We did the Campbell's soup cat.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.380
That was Andy Warhol.

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.380
Andy Warhol of DDR.

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.380
The Andy Warhol of DDR.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.380
You heard it first on Orange Lounge.

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:27.380
I prefer the Marilyn Monroe painting myself.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.380
But hey, to each his own.

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.380
Oh my god, whee!

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.380
I mean...

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.380
I'm doing yet another interview, so...

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.380
If you don't mind, go ahead and give us your name and association

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:48.380
Hi, I'm Megumi, also known as Sweet Megumi. I am part of Pet Squad for Step Squad.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.380
And what's your history in DDR?

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.380
I play DDR and I go to tournaments and I work for tournaments and stuff. I don't usually enter them, but I'm there.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:03.380
I'm interrupting this to say I looked it up. It's Anne Robinson. Thank you, Anne Robinson.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:10.820
See everyone and always friendly. Yes, the girl in the pink. Yes. So, um, what do you think of the tourney today?

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.140
It's pretty cool

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.900
There's a lot of people that I haven't seen for quite a while and I like the way Ruben has to set up as like

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.900
you know the green room type of thing so

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:23.500
And who do you think is gonna come out on top for a PA or for a freestyle?

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:29.780
Of course, I'd say Oakey because he's my favorite and freestyle. I don't know who entered so

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:33.740
So, if AJ's here, he'll probably win it.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.740
If not, I don't know.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:41.300
So, do you have any final words for the listeners or for the community or any sage words of

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:45.620
wisdom from observation?

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:46.620
I don't know.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.820
Just play DDR.

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.820
Indeed.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.820
How honest.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.820
And, by the way, Stas Quadons.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.820
Yes.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.820
We do.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.820
Anyway, thank you.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.820
Thank you.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.820
No problem.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820
Whee!

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.340
And the newest in line of interviews for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.700
Go ahead and tell everyone who you are and a little bit about your involvement in the

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.700
community.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.700
What's up, yo?

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.340
This is Jay Kinetic representing the SSF Step Squad family as well as the Step Squad Assassins

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.340
and Pet Squad.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.900
I've been playing this game since some of you didn't even know 1.5 was back in MGL so

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.900
I could be considered an OG.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.220
Basically Step Squad was formed in order to bring more of a family element to DDR.

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.580
We wanted to be the alternative to most of the DDR3 communities out there that are biased

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:35.900
against gender, race, sexual orientation, you name it.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:39.660
We have about 30, 35 players right now who are dedicated to the game as well as getting

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:45.900
each other through tough times and just being there for each other like family, I guess.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:50.500
One thing that I need to comment is that the squeal of daddy in the background was Draconis'

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:56.500
daughter, Lily, who is famous for, she's also known as Fuzzy Half, and is also famous for

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.020
the quote, this DVR sucks. So, I just thought I'd mention that because you can hear.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:05.340
Alrighty. Are you sure nobody was tied up at the tournament or anything like that?

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.660
There was no bondage going on at the tournament that I saw.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.660
What a shame.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:13.500
What a person at the Step Squad owned...anyway.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.500
So, as far as tourney goes, are you competing or working or, you know, how's your involvement

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.500
with this tourney here?

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.500
Today I'm out in my SSA uniform and providing security.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:28.500
We haven't had too many rowdy people, so I'm sitting here enjoying the Heineken courtesy of my friends Wendell and Si.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.500
What's up, Thieves Guild?

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:34.500
Normally I do compete in tournaments. I didn't have time to prepare a routine this time,

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.500
but the next tournament I'm looking forward to is Scandio or the Disney's Rave tournament,

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.500
or I might pull an improv, I don't know, as well as PA.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.500
So far for the PA or the freestylers in each category, who do you think is going to come out on top?

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:51.500
I'm hoping that Jazz comes out on top of the PA'ers in this particular tournament.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.500
Freestyle is still unpredictable. I'm still not sure who's entered, so I'm going to try to keep a close eye on that.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
We're going to be hanging out here until about 9 o'clock.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:02.500
But it's always a good crop. We have some of the most skilled freestylers out here today.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.500
We've got Rain from RTF out here, Fuzzy Half from Step Squad, just newly inaugurated.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.500
He's here. Wendell's here. I'm not sure if he's competing.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500
It's going to be a hot competition as normal.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:17.500
What's your view on the Baymani community currently and what kind of advice would you give?

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:45.700
There are a lot of veteran players who give some of the new school players shit just to

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.660
give them shit, and I don't feel that that's right.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:53.500
I feel that there are a lot of online communities such as ddrspot.com, ddrfreak.com, and Step

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:58.420
Squad message board, plug ourselves in there, that provide a quasi-decent environment.

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:01.740
I'd say Step Squad out of the three does, but then again we're kind of a gay community

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.860
in that respect because we only let in people that we know or people that are part of the

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:06.860
squad.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:11.200
Doesn't mean you can't visit, but the reason why we keep it that way is because it gives

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.580
all the players involved a chance to grow rather than having to deal with the prejudice

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:20.640
and stereotypes of the DDR community at large. This doesn't mean that the community at large

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.600
is a negative thing. Jason Coe, alias J-Dog, you may know him from the DDR Freak Boys,

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.480
has encouraged a very large, very skilled community. It just means that with that exposure

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.000
that you get from interacting with that larger community, you may encounter more prejudice

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.640
and more stereotypes, because for every one intelligent person there is, there's at least

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.600
another nine who are like, oh, I am easy and I am weak because I can pass all nine katas,

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.840
that sort of thing. So I feel that the community is growing and I hope to see it progress a

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.580
little bit more in the United States, even though Konami of America can kiss my ass because

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:55.400
they screwed us. But at the same time, I still think it's going to grow.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.640
I didn't get screwed.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.240
I didn't get screwed.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.240
Why weren't we invited?

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.760
I don't think people are going to be playing it in the States, and if not, hell, I'll go

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.720
play Pump It Up. I don't care.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.720
So do you have any parting words for the listeners?

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:17.720
Shoutouts to RTF, Gary, Shintenchi, NoSkills, pretty much everybody in there, Rain, there's

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:24.720
way too many heads to shoutout, StepSquad, THC, TCL, Tag, the DJ Trunks message board,

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.720
Orange Lounge, where he put me on this interview, I'm on my third beer, I'm about to go get

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720
a fourth.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.720
Jessica, under Sedation Live, go to that website, that show is funny as hell, shoutouts to...

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.960
Travis, Ross, shout-outs to NorCalDDR, keep it live man, these other people get lazy,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.360
Tequila, shout-out to him, shout-outs to nobody but Jen representing NY and the whole movement

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.360
basically.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.360
Thank you.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.680
That's what I do, thanks for having me on Jamie.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:20:00.440
Alright, so that was the second part of our Dalamendi interview brought to us by the lovely

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:04.820
other half of the show Jamie who was able to go out to the tourney yesterday

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.940
unfortunately I was unable to go but I will I think the next set of interviews

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:14.300
that are gonna happen on the show I'm hoping over the Labor Day weekend I'm

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.700
going to be getting out of town and I might be going to some of the hot Bay

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:22.660
Area arcades and getting some random interviews around there so you never

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.980
know yeah you better watch out I'm gonna be running around the bay with a tape

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.220
recorder and I'm coming after you.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.340
Anyway, a big hello to all of our new listeners tonight listening in for our coverage of the

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.340
Dollar Mandy tournament.

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:38.860
If you want to join our chat room, just join Channel Orange Lounge on any other side IRC

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.860
server.

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.260
That's the server that hosts all the big Bimani channels like DDR Freak, 2DX Styles, all those

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.260
big channels.

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:48.340
We're on there too under Channel Orange Lounge.

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.820
And I'm being given some results from SoCal Kicks.

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.060
There was another tournament that happened over the weekend and that was the Power Station

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.480
2 tournament.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.360
And in PA, the first place winner was Trunks, second was Frost, third was Lazy Pinoy, and

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.360
fourth was...

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.800
How do you pronounce it?

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.960
I don't want to mess it up.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960
You've seen this before.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960
I haven't.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.500
Sinai Butterfly, is that how you say it?

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.500
Thank you.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:17.520
Freestyle, first place, Kenny Wood with Santa Doing Doubles, and second place was Hungry

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.520
Asian.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.520
He doesn't remember the song.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:25.760
And then Jenneth with Remember You, and then to Sunny Butterfly again with Let's Talk It

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760
Over.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.280
And there's pictures at 2dxstyle.com slash sck.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.360
And it was all held on a 5th Mix machine.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360
Pretty good stuff.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.600
So, also I should plug the Monty Music and More program, which is always on this network

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.000
when we're not here.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.920
the music from DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania series, and there's other random stuff in there too,

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920
Bust-A-Groove, Parappa.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920
Because we are indeed random.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.680
We'll play whatever the hell we feel like playing, Bomani and more, on a dial-up print

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.680
in the stream.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.680
Did you mention our chat room?

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.440
Yeah, I did Channel Orange Lounge, on the other side of the seat.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.040
And one other thing, the Monday night rebroadcast, if you missed any part of the show, if you

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.540
missed our first set of interviews, we had a lot of people in the first set of interviews,

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:13.120
we do rebroadcast the show, we'll be rebroadcasting these shows on Monday nights, so tomorrow

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.320
night on August 19th. Tune in at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the rebroadcast

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.160
of this show and actually we'll be doing it twice. We're going to rebroadcast it at 7

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.520
o'clock and 11 o'clock. Because you're special enough to have it twice. Yes, you're going

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:32.560
to get it twice and in the middle there, you're going to get it twice. In the middle of that

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.800
big sandwich, we're going to rebroadcast an old show. We're going to be rebroadcasting

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.360
episode number 6 and for those that don't know, that was the one when we had Mel B and

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.540
melody visiting us and so we have some in-house interviews with them so I'll be

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:48.740
airing at nine o'clock tomorrow on Monday August 19th have I talked enough

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.040
no all right I just want to whore out the station because I know we've got new

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.420
listeners tonight oh one other thing the email any songs you want to hear any

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.940
comments on the show marriage proposals for myself or Jamie send them along we'll

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.380
just refuse them though sorry or just go ahead and send us some hate mail to

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:08.180
because we need some comedy we did we did get some hate mail a couple weeks

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:13.340
ago. That was fun. That guy was like, I'm not going to say anything because I'm nice

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:18.820
and he was retarded. Send all your love and hate mail to orangeloungeradio.com. That's

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.520
all one word, Orange Lounge Radio. You want to intro this next song for us, Jamie? This

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.920
is the one you were searching around for. Let's just make it a surprise. Let's just

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.260
make it a surprise. It is not the full version, but it's close enough. We're going to take

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:36.100
a quick break, and when we come back, more interviews! We'll do the interviews at the

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.880
the show. We're going to do listless. We're going to do a really quick listless segment

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:46.020
with the...you want to enter this? Best DDR background. The best DDR background. Not necessarily

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:50.100
the video, but images, anything associated with it. For some of our new listeners, want

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:54.700
to tell them some of the results of our previous listless competitions. Well, we've had best

01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:04.420
2DX song. Was absolute. Absolute. Best 2DX video was...Love is Dreaminess. And the worst

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.640
bimani song in history next to let them move because let them move is already assumed the

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.020
worst bimani song in history bye bye baby balloon bye bye baby balloon was determined

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.180
that song will no longer ever be on our playlist that song is banned from our playlist we will

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.860
never play it i'd like to add the future song that should be added to that list and that

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:27.260
would be have to be crash that song is ass and i just hope it doesn't get worse than

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:32.260
that the name contrary to popular belief is not after you know an accident although the

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.700
The song itself is an accident.

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.100
I'm sorry, what did you say, Matt?

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.740
I'm gonna go out there when you look at both of your eyes.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.620
God, this is awful.

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:40.700
OK, I won't waste a break.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.380
Break down, then crash.

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.060
What's the next one?

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.260
Stall.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.220
All right, I promise.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:46.720
No, no, no.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.260
I promise a break.

01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:50.300
Basically, the name is a combination of crap and ass.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.300
You crash.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.420

Oh, baby, don't you see me? It's all in vain. It's all because I'm dying if you need me.

01:33:52.820 --> 01:34:00.820
Don't dare to say I'm called un trois. Once more, it's just another word.

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:11.820
Oh, baby, don't hurt me. Don't cut your dent, cut someone. And if there's life worth living, don't break my heart.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.320

Oh, baby, don't you see me?

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.320
I'm in this all in vain

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.320
It's all because

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:05.320
I'm dying if you leave me

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.320
Don't dare to say

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.320
I'm calling for

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.320
This world is just another world

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.320

And make this life worth living

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.320

Don't cut down, love your words Oh baby, don't you see me

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:15.320
If it's all in vain, it's all because I'm dying if you need me

Don't break my heart Let me move my blur

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:58.320
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320
No!

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320
Do we care what people think of us?

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320
No!

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.320
Yes!

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.320
Extreme Bamani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.320
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.320
Tonight we've been doing some of the Dollar Mendy coverage from that big tournament in Concord yesterday.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.600
We're taking a break to do listless, one of our favorite segments here on the show.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.920
We're going to be talking about tonight the best DDR background, that little image that

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.760
comes up when you start the song.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.040
It's an artsy moment for DDR, it's kind of showing off the graphics capability or whatever

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.000
you want to call it, I don't know.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.960
We were kind of debating, there was a lot of debate in house about whether we were counting

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.000
the videos or not, and we decided no, we're not going to count the videos, we're just

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.200
going to talk about the actual backgrounds themselves, maybe we'll do DDR videos at a

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.200
later date.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.240
what's going to happen you guys in the chat room are going to be able to vote

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.560
we will we will give each our top three and then we're going to go through an

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.720
elimination round where once we have that big list of 12 songs there's four

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.720
of us participating we each get to take one off of the list and then those of

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.320
you in the chat room will get to vote you're going to send me a private

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:22.040
message in the chat room with your vote and that'll be the winner and then we'll

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.760
We'll get back to the last set of Dollar Mandy interviews and that will be a show.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.880
So let's get down to it.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.480
List list, best DDR background.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:37.240
Jamie what did you put down for your number three choice?

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.240
Paranoia.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:41.240
That guy's head is scary.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.820
And I mean old school paranoia.

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.120
So the very, very first paranoia.

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.440
Alright paranoia it is.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440
Matt, let's hear yours.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.480
okay mine has to go for in the mood for dancing because you've got that chick

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.120
leaning over and just it's got the cleavage shot there so that's it all

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.720
right fair enough Dave let's hear your number three choice

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.160
mine is abyss because it's got the two like yellow aliens or whatever they're

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:13.160
in the blue background good choice abyss my number three choice is conga feeling

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.680
because I like that chick it's very abstract art she's got what the hell is

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.160
that coming out of her mouth I like that conga feeling background okay so

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.160
Alright, let's hear the number two choices.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.160
Brilliant to you for the mecha thingy.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.160
The mecha dog.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.160
Brilliant to you for the mecha dog.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.160
You're being very old school tonight.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.160
What do you mean tonight? I'm old school every night.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.160
That's true, very true.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.160
Don't send me your votes just yet, Chad, when we don't have a list yet.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.160
You can't vote yet. We have to have a list and then you vote off the list.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.160
Alright, well this would be considered the most offensive background I could find in DDR.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.520
finding DVR. That would have to go to Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick with the guy in the fucking

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.520
underwear with the pistol. That's just disturbing. Fair enough. Oh Nick, Please Not So Quick.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:07.360
Okay, mine is Secret Rendezvous. Secret Rendezvous. Two chicks. Always good. You buy into that

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.920
whole Secret Rendezvous is about a bunch of lesbians theory? Dude, they're rubbing up

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.860
against each other. Alright, fair enough. My number two choice would be the Afrinova

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:23.580
a background, but the OG one from Third Mix, not the newer one, the chick, the reptile

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:24.580
thing.

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.580
Screaming into the thing.

01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:27.580
No.

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:33.820
We just, also, by the way, our listeners did not hear what Dave just said.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.820
Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:39.660
I said, I thought the one with the reptile was the primeval.

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.980
No.

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.980
The primeval one's all blurred, it's just- The first one had the person screaming at

01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980
the thing.

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.980
You got it.

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:46.980
A number one for me.

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:52.980
I'm no longer going to be old school with this. I say burning heat just because it's burning heat.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.980
Fair enough. Burning heat.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:41:00.980
Okay. I saw burning heat and about pooped my pants because I was having a Gradius II moment.

01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:01.980
Oh my God, I pooped my pants!

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.980
Because I was having a Gradius II, you know, orgasmic moment.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980
I saw the ninja?

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.980
Uh, yeah.

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.980
Anyway, Matt, your number one choice.

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:15.980
My number one choice is back from third mix. It has to be a get up and dance with the DJing penguin.

01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:22.980
and

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:26.420
uh... my number one also has

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:31.740
two things in it

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.780
so you got to remember one best d r background

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.020
last one on the list of my number one choice

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:42.060
was also on a please not so quick so

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:45.220
it started a revolution what can you say

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:49.420
unfortunately dramatic faces that was a duplicate we're gonna go ahead and let

01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:52.060
one more random one on the list we have bradley back in the corner i'm gonna

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.280
put him on the spot

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.780
you remember anything you don't know anything how in it

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.380

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:13.020
was that part of the or that was not the background

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.020
It was part of the video.

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.020
I thought it was part of the background too.

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.020
The background was...

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.080
Oh, that's right, the chick with the shirt, the letters.

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.080
Oh, well that's so pretty.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.240
Alright, we're going to go with B for you?

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240
Breakdown?

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.240
We'll do breakdown.

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240
We'll do breakdown.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240
Alright, breakdown it is.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.240
Yeah, I know.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:31.680
That'll get one vote if it doesn't get eliminated from the list which we're going to do right

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680
now.

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.680
Here's our list.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:39.380
So far we have Paranoia, In The Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Conga Feeling, Brilliant To You, Oh

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.880
Nick Please Not So Quick, Secret Rendezvous, Afro Nova, Third Mix,

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.740
6, Burning Heat, Get Up and Dance, Sugaru, Breakdown. This is going to be a hard one

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:51.440
to start eliminating from, but Jamie gets the first pick.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.440
Breakdown.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.960
I'm sorry, person who suggested it, but you know, t-shirts aren't that interesting.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.000
Alright, Breakdown's off. Matt?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:07.200
Alright, I'm going to have to go with, let's see here, Sugaru, because it's just kind of

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.200
boring.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200
Oh, Sugaru.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:12.680
It looks like they're beating each other with telephone poles. Was it just me that thought

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:16.680
That was like big telephone poles.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.680
Still got to have gone.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.680
Dave, your pick.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.680
Okay, um, I guess I'll have to take off Burning Heat, because, I mean...

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.680
Oh!

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.680
Well done!

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680
That's it.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.680
I mean, it's not that great of a picture.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.680
Alright, Burning Heat's gone.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.680
This is a hard one for me.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.680
It's not that good of a picture.

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:45.240
I, I like, I like all these backgrounds. Um, there's only one, I have two secret rendezvous's

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.240
out of there.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240
So we like the lesbian.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.600
I, I like the lesbian video but the background isn't all that. The background itself is kind

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.160
of boring. The video's good, background sucks. So it's gone.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.560
So here's our list starting at the beginning.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.120
And I'm going to post this in the chat room. You guys can vote now and then we're going

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:04.880

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:52.200
That's alright here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.700
You are the sweetest of you and me, but you're not a kingdom, oh

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.200
And you believed in me, and now I know

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.700
Get away, oh, get up and I'll kick you

01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:38.200
Get away, ooh, and I'll make fun of you

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.700
Get away, oh, get up and I'll suck you

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:45.700
It's my way up, but I can't help you

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700

Feels so light, didn't I know?

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:02.700
When you say my name, I wanna hear your kindness

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:03.700
Because you've been such a blast

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.700
So just listen to me, and I'll talk to you

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.700
I'm attending to you, I'm saying your sound

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.700
But I wanna hear your fucking music now

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:11.700
I wanna dance with the heart of music right now

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:14.700
You don't have to realize that life is just let's get on

01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.700
Let's get on

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.700
This is what I think about

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:21.700
You are my station to me

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.700
Let's get on

01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.700
This is what I think about

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:29.700
You are my station to me

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.700
It's all right, yeah, yeah

There's a case for la-la-la

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.700
It's all right in an old grave

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:40.700
See, it's the light, yeah, the kick, but la, la, la

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:43.700

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820

I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! I believe!

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.860
Mr. random person on the street, what do you think of the orange lounge pay money music and more show?

01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:39.860
Beautiful night, isn't it? It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a blood sucker.

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:54.260
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:58.740
That was a promo, a very random promo, a fan promo that was sent to us.

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:02.820
So if you want to make a promo for our show, put your own damn voice in it, do whatever

01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:08.460
the hell you want, send it to Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:13.260
And now, announcing our listless results, I tallied up all your votes in the chat room

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.520
and here they are.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:29.980
They are the results for the listless best DDR background.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:37.940
In third place for the best DDR background of all time, Paranoia.

01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:47.140
For second place, the best DDR video of all time, Abyss, yay, and the very first place

01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:55.260
winner for best DDR background of all time, Get Up and Dance, yay.

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:58.860
How about some more dollar, let's hear the last of the dollar MND interviews now, shall

01:49:58.860 --> 01:49:59.860
we?

01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:00.860
Let's show.

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:03.260
Alright, this is very short, we've only got a couple interviews in this segment, it's

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:06.740
only about three and a half minutes left of interviews, but we do have the interview with

01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:09.220
dark sound and the reason why

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:13.540
the webcast didn't work

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.980
yeah we're interviews

01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:19.380
so go ahead and tell everyone who you are and what you do in the community

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.320
hey what's up my name is Fuzzy Hat

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.740
I'm basically

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:25.140
the youngest drunkard in the DVR community

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.460
and freestyler debonair

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:31.180
so what are you doing in the tourney today, doing freestyle?

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:34.660
I'm doing some freestyle, mingling with some people, macking some chicks, you know

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:39.300
Basically all that good stuff and so who do you think is your main competition for a freestyle today?

01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:43.860
Main competition will definitely have to be the drunk Wendell and also the drunk reign of RTF

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:52.180
So, uh, do you have any parting words for the listeners or the community in general listeners of the community? I just want to say that

01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:58.740
For six bucks a pitcher of Heineken that fills eight glasses and it's not a bad deal. That's all

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:09.740
Thanks. So now the tournament is over, and my final interview of the day goes towards the man. So, tell us who you are and your history in the band wanted community. Briefly.

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:13.740
Hi, I'm Ruben Avdea, otherwise known as DarkSound, the jerk-off on DDR3.

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:21.740
My DDR history started a year ago with SVM closing, the day I started playing DDR. I've been mountain bikers ever since, I suppose.

01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:27.740
A sign of things to come, might I say. Just teasing. If you're out there, Ruben, I'm just teasing.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:32.240
I've been called a swiggler, an asshole, a jerk-off, and a really sexy guy.

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.240
That was me, by the way. They called him that.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.740
Um, so today we had this really cool tourney, and it was cool.

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.240
Uh, you got any questions?

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:45.240
Did the tournament, um, for PA or for freestyle turn out how you expected it to?

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:49.240
Um, PA actually took not as long as I expected it to,

01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:54.240
especially with the, uh, the added delay of trying to set up computers to work right.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.740
Um, we were planning to have...

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:01.540
I'm planning to have a webcast going at the same time.

01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:05.940
Unfortunately, that did not happen because I forgot some cables.

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:07.060
You heard it here first.

01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.380
He forgot cables.

01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:12.740
And that's why the webcast did not happen.

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:19.140
So yeah, it took us an hour longer to set up than we thought it would.

01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:21.780
Fortunately, we were able to get replacement pads the other night.

01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:25.220
And everything from then on went pretty good.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:26.180
Any other questions?

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.720
how about the uh...

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.460
as far as you know who won this and that, what do you think?

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.980
uh... i think uh... first and second place for Singles Freestyle was

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.840
really close, much too close

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.080
i would have actually hoped for a tide and something made that close

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:40.840
Gumby shut the hell up

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.160
uh...

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.340
maybe you messed up again

01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.640
maybe i messed up?

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:49.380
what if your face is messed up you fat four-headed freak?

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:52.500
Gumby's in the chat room right now so i might say address those cards and

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:55.760
letters to uh... rubin i think it's dark sound at spiggle

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.980
uh... yeah i i i think i enjoyed freestyle it was uh... it was amazing i

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:01.060
wish more people would have

01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.260
came you

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.100

01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.460
and yet

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:12.140

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.580
uh... so it was incredible uh... manager like

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:19.140

01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:19.740
that

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:21.260
enterprise leftover

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:27.380
people just take them? Damn, that sucks. Okay, never mind. But yeah. So yeah, it was an amazing

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:31.660
day. I enjoyed myself. It's going to be a pain in the ass to clean up, but oh well.

01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:35.020
And what are your final words for the listeners of Board jobs?

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:38.580
DDR sucks. Go play Mr. Driller.

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:39.580
Okay.

01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:40.580
Amen.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.580
Thank you.

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:47.660
And everybody, anybody have final words all at once to confuse the listeners? Absolutely

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.660
nothing.

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.860
pulled down his pants. Yeah, I pulled down my pants.

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:55.540
Don't be pulled down his pants, and there you have it.

01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.820
This is my last special interview with Wendell, because he's cute.

01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:04.660
Hey, how's it going? We're tired people, and Wendell got drunk.

01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:10.100
And may I have my bat? Come back here. That's how it ended. You didn't even really

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.380
interview Wendell, you just said, hey, how you doing? I interviewed him

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:16.020
earlier. Yeah, he interviewed him earlier, but I mean, he was talking with a

01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:19.340
normal voice that I do want to know when those normal voices there you have it

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:24.180
that was just happened right there so there's our coverage of the dollar

01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:28.140
Mindy tournament the first of many tournaments will be covering hopefully

01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:32.460
I'll be able to cover one in the future and Jamie did an excellent job with that

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:39.940
yeah thank you for that Jamie here I guess we're pretty much towards the end

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:43.260
of the show is there anything that you guys wanted to add here at the end of

01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:49.980
the show. Any final thoughts from the week? One plus one is two. There, I added. The lyrics

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:56.300
to stick around. Well, actually, I have something constructive. It's the sim update for the

01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:04.580
week. Let's see here. We've got a DWI 2 version or 2.02 out. Unfortunately, it looks like

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.380
the videos in the background don't work anymore. It works and it doesn't work and it works

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:11.380
That's out with the new solo arrows, and yay.

01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:17.380
StepMania Beta 6 is rumored to be coming out pretty soon. I hope to see that. That should be nice.

01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:25.380
And Team Guilo's site is actually back up. I haven't gotten the actual link yet. It's not teamguilo.com anymore.

01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:31.380
It's off of someone's computer, so it's an actual IP address, and I have to find that and maybe post it somewhere.

01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:37.500
somewhere and that's about it. Oh, and Turning Mix 2 is still going so check out those entries

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.220
if the server is not too clogged. And that's it.

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:47.900
Any other final thoughts from people here? What the hell are you doing? Oh my god, Dave

01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:52.740
is like, we have this, we have what we call LSD here in the room, although it's actually

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:55.380
that, I don't know if you remember this from high school, at least it was high school for

01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.660
me, those little nuclear warhead candies that you could put in your mouth.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.660
It's the liquid version.

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:02.760
Now these are liquid versions, they come in little bottles that look like LSD.

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.980
It slipped out of my hand, um, in my mouth.

01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:09.500
You almost swallowed the actual bottle, like the whole thing?

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.500
Yeah.

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.700
He likes it so much, he tried to get the very last of it back into the plastic.

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:17.520
You can just keep that bottle, because I don't even want it now.

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.280
That's why it's not safe for three-year-olds, and it's not safe for Dave, either, apparently,

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.280
so...

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.280
Hey, did I choke?

01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:25.280
Did I choke?

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.280
I'm still here.

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:27.280
The bottle is in the trash.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.280
You were about to choke.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.120
She didn't do what I do and spit propel water all over the floor, you know, yay.

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.120
You're going to clean that up, by the way?

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:36.120
No, I'm just kidding.

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.980
This gag was brought to you by Gatorade.

01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:43.280
Next week, as we mentioned towards the beginning of the show, Jamie will unfortunately not

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.280
be here.

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.280
I'm fortunate for us.

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.280
Unfortunately, my half.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:47.280
Yeah, fortunate for her.

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280
I'm going to be in Vegas.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.040
She's going to be partying in Vegas with a bunch of the other DDR freaks, so that'll

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.360
be a lot of fun.

01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:54.360
Maybe I can manage some interviews.

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.840
Maybe you should get us some interviews.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.640
I think that would be a fine idea.

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640
Maybe.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:00.640
If you can swing. If you're not too drunk...

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.640
You never know, the more interesting ones may happen while I'm drunk.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.640
Next week, your co-host will be the one and only Matt, also known as Loki,

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.640
because he's been here every other show, so it just kind of makes sense right now.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.640
He's been a big part of the show, so he'll be the temporary co-host.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.640
Of course, he's always in the big...

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:17.640
He's like our footstool, you know.

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.640
Yeah, he's...

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:19.640
He sits on the floor, so...

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.640
We just rest our feet here?

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.640
I'm just going to put my feet right here.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:25.640
No, he's always been a loyal supporter of the show since the beginning.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.640
Just like everybody here.

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.640
Thanks, you guys, for showing up. I always appreciate it.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.140
Uh, any-

01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:31.140
We are LeFou.

01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.140
It's time for the final words.

01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:35.140
Bradley.

01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.640
Mmm, nothing to say.

01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.140
Nothing to say, as usual.

01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.140
Dave.

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:41.140
Um, this one's for Brad.

01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:43.640
Cunt, cock, bitch, fuck, dick, math.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.640
Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.640
Math.

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.640
All I have to say is M is the greatest song in the wor-

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.140
Oh, wait, that was V.

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.140
Never mind. M sucks.

01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:54.140
M is the greatest letter.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.140
Dude, no.

01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:13.140
My final thought is tournaments need to be more like they were yesterday with the fun that went on and I had a good time and Matt wants my microphone and he can't have it.

01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:16.140
And so is Dave. God damn it! You whores!

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:22.140
Actually, one more thing. I hope when they do post the videos for this tournament that they actually include a...

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:31.140
Basically a mega-mix of all of Ruben's little acts in between the actual freestyle because that was great and I'd love to see that.

01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.140
Team Dave for life!

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:38.140
Don't forget to listen to our Bimani Music and More program, always playing on the station when we're not around.

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:41.140
Whore out the show to all your friends. We could use the listeners.

01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:44.940
But we love you for listening. Thanks for supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We love you. Bye-bye.

01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:49.940
Tune in next week. I don't know what we're going to be talking about next yet, but it'll be a fun show. I promise you!

01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:57.940
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:06.140

01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:10.140
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:12.140
Alcohol is your best friend.

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:14.140
And weed. It's all about the crime.

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:18.140
Heineken and weed, the perfect combination for a summer party.

01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.140
Only if you're over 21 though.

01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:22.140
I don't want you 18 year olds writing me or anything.

01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:24.140
I got eyes, I got busts, don't write me.

01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.140
I still say, bike it in and vodka.

01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.140
And stay away from Mark Kelly.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.140
And stay away from Mark Kelly, he's evil.

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.140
I don't know about 15 year olds that wouldn't have gotten me.

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.140
I wouldn't have bought a whole car.

01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:37.140
Diablo 2, and then I got Mack on the 14 year old at the junior high?

01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.140
Oh fuck. I got busted by the cops.

01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:43.140
If you ain't drinkin' rut, you ain't playin' rut. Holla!

01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:56.140
Sponsored by Heineken, Sapporo, Corona, Spotten Beer, Maui Waui, Mota, and other types of various melwachas to Amsterdam.

01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:58.140
And Guinness!

01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:00.140
And Guinness!

02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:03.140
And all the other Scottish shows, because if there's no Scottish, it's crap!

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140
That's right, fuck Budweiser!

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:05.140
Budweiser's shit beer!

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:06.140
Fuck that beer!

02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:07.140
Fuck Tequila!

02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:08.140
Tequila's Satan!

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:23.820
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
