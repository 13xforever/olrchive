Isn't this four, two, one, five pussy Waze?!

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,480
You BITCH!

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Now let me take this difficult two-one-two-fuck- Ew!

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,440
You have no moral self

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,840
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of her face

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Kiss my grip, mooch.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hiney ho.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Me too!

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Uh, fucker, yeah?

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm working on it.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Loser.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Lame.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm a fan of my face.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Breathing.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Breath.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Heaving breath.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Heaving.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Whatever.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I am your singing telegram

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,840
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Typically I would be saying joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSapra.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:02:05,520
I see ice cream.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,520
want ice cream? They're ice cream candies. It's ice cream time! Now you know what the

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,320
ice cream time sounds like. Of course, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,360
Say hello to Joe, also known as Dark Tetsuya. And we've got Irene, the rice princess. Is

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,840

on orange lounge radio

Can you hear the cheering?

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Super performance!

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Nice!

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Perfect!

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Our dance showed us a dream for the future. Tomorrow is another day. You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Today or not today It doesn't mean that much to me

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Kiss me and set me free

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
You can do that, you can do that

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,560
So what's it gonna be?

50
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
A real love for poetry

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Kiss me and set me free

52
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
You can do that, you can do that

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
I treat you like a dog, I treat you like a frog

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
If you ever let me down, you will love me, baby

55
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I am sure of what I want

56
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Tell me what to do

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Should I love you like a fool?

58
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Should I stop playing fool? What is good enough for you to make it happen?

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Let me say you'll let me go But either way I've got to know

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,560
What is good enough for you to make it happen?

61
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
What about you?

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Come on inside, it's driving me crazy Am I alone to feel this way?

63
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Come on inside, tell me you're the way back Show me that I'm the one to love you like a fool

64
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,680
I been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go

65
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:39,180
Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe I been married a long time ago

66
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,460
I been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go

67
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,460
I've been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go?

68
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,460
Where did you come from, Cotton Eye Joe?

69
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,460
He came to town like a magic storm

70
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,460
He rode through the fields to ask for help

71
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,460
He was born to a solid father of a gun

72
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,460
But all his trouble was running so fast

73
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:32,660
I've been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go?

74
00:07:32,660 --> 00:08:00,180
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

75
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,880
this on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

76
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,280
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

77
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

78
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,480
best things in life are free. Well, thank you, Mel, for letting us know that one. You're

79
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,340
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and that set we had all Euromix 2 stuff. Starting it

80
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,420
off Vanity Angel with Fix and in the middle there Love Ya Like a Fool by Jessica Folker.

81
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,100
Kind of sounds a little bit like Divas, a little bit of that R&B stuff.

82
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,740
What the folk-er was that, huh Brent?

83
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,880
And of course, if you didn't know that one, probably one of the most well-known songs

84
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
on there.

85
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,540
At least I know that one very well, Rednecks with Cotton Eye Joe.

86
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,200
They're either Rednecks, but they spell it the leet way, they spell it a Rednecks with

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
an X.

88
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Like, oh yeah, they're out to get you.

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,620
So I have to ask Melody, if Melody can get on the mic here, because Melody gets asked

90
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
this question all the time.

91
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
We just played the promo.

92
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Where is Mel B?

93
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,260
Mel's not here.

94
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,380
I swear I'm getting a shirt that says that.

95
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Mel's not here.

96
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,600
No, but Mel's in the same place where Jamie's at.

97
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
They're all in Vegas together.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Yes, he's not getting back in Vegas, I'm sure.

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,860
I don't think it's any secret.

100
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,100
There's a little moderator's convention going on in Vegas for DDR Freaks, so that's where

101
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
they're all at right now.

102
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
And every mod has to be.

103
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
night away.

104
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,180
Every mod asks me, are you going along too?

105
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Are you going along too?

106
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
No, I'm not a mod.

107
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
I can't go.

108
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
I'm poor.

109
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,700
Unless anyone wanted to, like, sponsor me for a trip to Vegas, it just wasn't happening.

110
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,480
I'm sure Jamie's having tons of fun down there.

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,500
She was going to be recording some interviews for us, hopefully, because there's a lot of

112
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,380
well-known people in the community that are going to be there.

113
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,260
Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get the tape player to take down there and tape some

114
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
stuff.

115
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
So, we're shit out of luck.

116
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,380
But hey, that just means we're just going to have to go around throughout the community

117
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,300
and get the interviews, you know, at other times. And hopefully we get a drunken voicemail

118
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,920
because for the Saturday night program that I do, understudationlive.org, they're supposed

119
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,120
to be leaving a drunken voicemail for that show, so I'm pretty sure I'd be able to use

120
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,700
that drunken voicemail on this show if we can get it, so we'll see, we'll see, who knows.

121
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,020
Alright, I was just given a link to read some results for a tournament that happened yesterday

122
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,140
at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco.

123
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
I haven't been there yet.

124
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,200
I hear it's really cool though.

125
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,300
It's like a golf land in San Francisco is what they're calling it, because they've got

126
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,400
I believe Dance Maniacs as well, kind of a question mark, but I know they also have a

127
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,020
BeatMania 3 7th, which is not a very commonly seen machine.

128
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,540
So the results of that contest were first place was Uncle Fuzz of Dot Half, and second

129
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,240
place was the Asian Harry Potter of Dot Half.

130
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,540
The Asian Harry Potter.

131
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,460
I know a guy that looks like an Asian Harry Potter. It's not this guy, but that's funny.

132
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,760
And then third place was Black Lab of Team P.O.P. I keep wanting to say Poop when I see

133
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,720
that except there's only one O, so it's Team Pop. And fourth place was C. Hop of Team,

134
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,020
and it's got all this leet speak. It's G.E., basically. So congratulations to all those

135
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,880
people. I noticed the real names of the third and fourth place winners, both Ryan. So if

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,500
your name's Ryan, you must be pretty good at Perfect Attack. This is only a Perfect

137
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,600
attack tournament. No freestyle. It was just a mini-tournament. So, congratulations to

138
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,060
all those of you that placed or participated in that tournament. Sounds like a fun time.

139
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,140
I should have gone out there. I think I vaguely heard about it, but I didn't know it was this

140
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,460
soon. Thought it was a ways away. Whoops, my bad. Anyway, oh, I'm being yelled at in

141
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:41,700
the chat room, Team Pop. I have to say hi to Tal, because he'll beat me up if I don't.

142
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
So there you go. Why aren't you here? That's my question.

143
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Ah, you didn't get to whore the mic.

144
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah, you didn't get to whore the mic tonight, nah nah nah.

145
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
And, uh, thanks to Black Lab for giving me that link,

146
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
and he wants everybody to know that he beat Tigger. So, there you go.

147
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Did you say Tigger?

148
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
No, no, no. No, no, no.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Tigger is somebody's online name.

150
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
It's not like a euphemism for your private parts like it is for you, Brett.

151
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
What? No, I don't hear what I'm talking about.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Bounce, bounce, what?

153
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:32,000
I have to make a correction to last week.

154
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,400
We debuted on the show some new 8th style MP3s.

155
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,680
You might have heard this one, we played M for you.

156
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Crap!

157
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,540
Well, you know what?

158
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
They're fake anyway.

159
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,000
That's what we just found out during the week.

160
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,920
It's not confirmed that they're fake, but let's just say it's not confirmed that they're

161
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,100
real either.

162
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,040
We actually took a really good listen to them outside.

163
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,360
Now obviously to suit all you modem users who are listening to this show, we have to

164
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,140
down code the show a lot, so you can't really hear the instruments as clear as we can.

165
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,440
We really listened to that, and it doesn't quite sound like it came off a B-Mania machine.

166
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,040
Possibility it still could be a song, but the Magic 8-Ball says, all signs point to

167
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
no.

168
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
So...

169
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,140
Well, doesn't DJ Taka have his own website, or was that a talk, or I get confused.

170
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Taka has his own website.

171
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Whatever.

172
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
I don't believe Taka does.

173
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,980
It sounds like a freakin' pushpin anyway, so...

174
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
It doesn't matter.

175
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
That song sucks ass.

176
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,380
I hope it's not real.

177
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,380
I hope no actual artist that would be featured on any Bimani would make that piece of shit.

178
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
We'll see, who knows.

179
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,380
But then again, there's Crash, so...

180
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Yeah, as long as Crash exists, who knows.

181
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Breakdown!

182
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,380
What else do we want to say? Oh, next week's show.

183
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,380
And I haven't told anybody in here the plan for next week's show, but I did talk about it with Jamie.

184
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Next week's show, I'm not going to be here.

185
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:04,520
Because next weekend is Labor Day Weekend, so we get three days off work. So I'm going out of town for the whole weekend.

186
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:16,360
So we're not going to be doing a live show next week, but what we're going to do on Wednesday night over at Roseville Golfland, we're going to tape the show live at Golfland on Wednesday night and we're going to air it on Sunday night.

187
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:26,200
So I hope all you guys can make it out to Golfland on Wednesday night. We're going to tape the show out there. Patron harassing will be encouraged because we don't get to do this very often.

188
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,440
So, somebody already suggested we play the counterweight trick on Beachhead with some

189
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,640
unsuspecting people, and we're going to go out there and we're going to just have fun

190
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
with it.

191
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
We're going to run around.

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Who knows?

193
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
It's going to be a crazy show.

194
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
It's going to be a very experimental show.

195
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,520
We don't know what we're going to do really at this point, but we are going to be taping

196
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,660
next week's show live at Golf Land this Wednesday night.

197
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,700
I don't know an exact start time, so after seven at some point, but not too late, because

198
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,500
you know, I have to work on Thursday, so I can't say all too late, but...

199
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,780
I guess we could say forget about having any tournaments there any time in the near future.

200
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,700
Well, who knows, we'll see what we can do.

201
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,860
Management might not like us after Wednesday.

202
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,820
We'll see.

203
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
And I don't care...

204
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,420
Any other plans for what you guys want to do on Wednesday over at Golf Plan?

205
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,740
I'll be bringing, yes, I'm very obsessed.

206
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,300
I'll be bringing my mobile editing computer with me for edits.

207
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,540
You're going to kill people with your edits.

208
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
I finished...

209
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,340
By the way, tell people, you know, this is a national show, we've got people all over

210
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,460
the U.S. who are participating, so not everybody's going to be able to participate in this, but

211
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,180
maybe for some of the Bay Area local people, tell everybody about your edit contest coming

212
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
up.

213
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Okay, well I have an edit contest.

214
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,580
Normally, I've been posting on the SAC reminding boards.

215
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,420
Basically the edits fall in two categories, you have freestyle and then you have hell

216
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,380
it. It's a really fucking hard edit. And because I work at a video distribution company, normally

217
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,660
prizes are a whole bunch of DVDs. And I can say this much that I won the last edit contest.

218
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,780
I won the freestyle portion. I literally must have gotten hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs.

219
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,040
So much stuff. Insane. Cool. And like screeners of stuff that wasn't even released yet. I

220
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,260
saw American Psycho 2 before any of you. No, I didn't watch it. It didn't look good. But

221
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Because I have it. And you don't.

222
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Tons of anime DVDs for sure. I know that first place is going to get Lord of the Rings and both awesome powers movies.

223
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,260
That's for sure. And then I just have both of them.

224
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Just a bunch of crap. It's first and second.

225
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,260
It takes what, a half hour to make a decent edit maybe?

226
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,260
Nothing to enter. It's totally free to enter. You just have to be there.

227
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,260
At some point, I was trying to do it where I could have people submit edits online to me, but that got to be too confusing.

228
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
No, that's not fair. They gotta be there. They gotta be there in person.

229
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
Yeah, so you have to be down at Sun Splash in order to enter.

230
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Yeah, that's about it.

231
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Cool. I want to give you a free plug for that.

232
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Well, this time around, hopefully since I've got that nice little laptop, hopefully everything works. I haven't gotten them set up yet.

233
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I'll be able to copy the edits from people's cards and actually be able to post them on the internet when I'm done.

234
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,540
Well, I finished my hell edit today, so those that saw it, don't say anything about it,

235
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
but it's going to be good, I think.

236
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,500
I hate to stroke my own ego here, but I think you'll like it.

237
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:24,780
Well, also speaking of edits, my edits are now on the SoCal Kicks website, www.socalkicks.com.

238
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,980
And actually, maybe we can get the winners of the contest to get all those edits.

239
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,220
Maybe if we kiss enough ass with SoCal Kicks, he'll put all those edits up for us.

240
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Who knows?

241
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm sure.

242
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I'll be sending them some more at some point, just have to get them making some.

243
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Sounds good.

244
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,060
I was trying to think of more housekeeping things I wanted to talk about.

245
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,160
Obviously the Bomani Music Amore program, always on this station when we're not live.

246
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,060
All sorts of stuff from Dance Mania, all the DDR, 2DXs.

247
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,200
We've been updating that with new MP3s here and there.

248
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,820
We're going to be hopefully getting much, much more music soon because we're going to

249
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,300
have to buy some more space, so that'll mean way more music.

250
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,540
And basically our philosophy of the Milani Music Award program is don't play the stuff

251
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,220
that sucks.

252
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,820
Basically we already voted the worst Milani song in history on this program next to Let

253
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,620
Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

254
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,920
You'll never ever hear that song on our playlist, so we're only playing the good stuff.

255
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,060
So if you have any requests, send us an email at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

256
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,860
I've been getting a few new remixes here and there, some mixed things.

257
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,340
I might play one of those later in the show.

258
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,700
towards the end of the show I got one during the week it's very interesting

259
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,380
it's a hybrid of two songs that you wouldn't imagine together so we might

260
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,240
play that towards the end of the show if we got some time if you have any fan

261
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,140
remixes go ahead and email me about sending those to me at orange lounge

262
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,500
radio at yahoo.com and Jamie and I'll look them over and maybe we'll go ahead

263
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,900
and put them in our playlist but I ask that they be you know kind of remixed a

264
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,120
lot like don't just you know reloop the song in a sound editor take clips I'm

265
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,640
adding like you know put some new instruments in there take some vocals do

266
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
new things with it kind of remix it a little more than just you know five

267
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:13,640
second remixing job what else I want to say there was something I don't know

268
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,200
anyway I don't I don't make notes where are my notes I do have some notes let's

269
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,860
see did I say I wanted to say something else about something they could email me

270
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,560
about what are they paying you for nothing I don't get paid for this you

271
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Huh?

272
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
I don't get paid for this.

273
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Isn't that a travesty?

274
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,080
Well, where's my money?

275
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,840
There was something else that I was going to say they could email me about.

276
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Ice cream?

277
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Requests.

278
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,440
You can always email your requests if there's a song that you're not hearing in the Bomani

279
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,160
Musical More program, or on this show you can always email us your requests and we'll

280
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,880
get those to you as well.

281
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I'll think of it.

282
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
It'll come to me later.

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,200
Could it be songs that you'd like to hear in Bomani Musical More?

284
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Right, requests.

285
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Yes.

286
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Okay.

287
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Requests.

288
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I don't know.

289
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh well.

290
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,700
We're being demanded in the chat room to do this little segment that we usually do when

291
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,040
Jamie's here, but when she's not here, we fill in for her. It's called the Fuck You

292
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,540
of the Week. Does anybody have a Fuck You? I know I have a Fuck You of the Week.

293
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,840
I have a collaborative Fuck You. A collaborative Fuck You of the Week. Alright,

294
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,760
let's hear it. Your Fuck You of the Week. Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,180
Sorry. That's Jamie's music. No. That's Jamie's FU music. I gotta play Matt's FU music. I'm

296
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,700
I'm sorry. Matt's F.U. music is much better. No, no, no. Matt's F.U. music is much better.

297
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,220
Agile will like this. You'll like this, Brad.

298
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,220
Okay, now you can do your F.U. of the Week. I hate this fucking music.

299
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:46,340
See? See? It makes him angry. Anyways, my F.U. of the Week has to go to Kaiser

300
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,300
to go to Kaiser for renting out RVGL for the last three days what the hell I mean

301
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,080
I've seen company parties last you know a day or something but why three days I

302
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,500
mean it seems a little I can see why I used to work for Kaiser their ass holes

303
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,860
fuck you yeah well they're not assholes I don't know I don't know anybody for

304
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,160
there but you know they're rich enough cuz they're doctors and shit you know

305
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,160
That's why they can, the only reason why they do this is because they can afford to.

306
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Yeah.

307
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
What?

308
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,920
The point is, what do they have to do at RBGL?

309
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,040
I mean, they're not playing DDR, are they?

310
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,400
You know, I'm imagining some physician trying DDR or Drummania or something, and he's like,

311
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,200
whoa, rock out, yeah, you know, like reliving his youth because he's bald and, you know.

312
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,800
I broke my fibula.

313
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Exactly.

314
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,440
Exactly maybe they're doing research or something. I don't know

315
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,640
For three days or maybe they're just too stupid and uh, you know just I don't know what I want to go down and party

316
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,440
So we're just gonna leave the weekend open leave it open

317
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Well, I can say that also the folks that work at Kaiser work some pretty effed up schedules

318
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,840
Like I have a friend that works there who's working at 1130 tonight

319
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,380
So imagine you know if they were only doing it for one day and you had to work, you know

320
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,740
That would kind of suck.

321
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,320
So two days, but three days, and on the weekend, not only any weekend, but the weekend before

322
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,680
school starts for most people, if it hasn't started already, it's kind of, what a bunch

323
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
of bitches.

324
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I mean, they must have had to pay.

325
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
I was scheduling.

326
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
My mom actually works for Kaiser.

327
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,520
I don't get to see my mom for long stretches of time because I decide to go out in the

328
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
daytime.

329
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,640
That's when she's asleep because she works like 2.30 to 11 at night, and then weekends

330
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
too.

331
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,600
So it's like, okay, hi mom, bye mom, see you later, walk by.

332
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,840
it can be kind of screwed up. It's kind of like when dogs pee pee on trees

333
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,280
and stuff, they're marking their territory, they're showing their power. That's what Kaiser's

334
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,400
doing right now. They're showing their power. They're peeing on our DDR machine?

335
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,960
If they do, I'm going to kick their ass. Oh my God.

336
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,480
They're going to die. No health insurance can bring them back from

337
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,840
the dead that I'll take them to or something like that. Somebody help me, quick.

338
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
I told you to do it somewhere else.

339
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,840
That sucked because I couldn't go down and play DDR down there all weekend long.

340
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I mean, I could understand missing out one day, but I haven't played in, like, a couple weeks.

341
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm starting to feel like drawls.

342
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Stop me with that goddamn song!

343
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Ugh! I hate that thing!

344
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Kaiser steals your soul!

345
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
We are pizer!

346
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Kaiser, wave!

347
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
You didn't have that mic off, did you?

348
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
No.

349
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Okay, yeah, don't turn it off, because it'll turn them both off.

350
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,800
I didn't, just checking, just checking.

351
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,760
We have some FUs from the chat room

352
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
that would like to be shared with all of you out there.

353
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,200
If you want to join our chat room,

354
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,400
you're just going to join any other side IRC server.

355
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
That's one of the servers in your list.

356
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,280
If you have M-I-R-C, that's in your list.

357
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,000
One example server you could join

358
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,800
would be IRC.eggheads.org.

359
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,040
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

360
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,740
And that is the same server, by the way,

361
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,940
as most of the big Bamani channels,

362
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,300
DDR Freak, 2DX Style, DDR Spot,

363
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I'll have their chat rooms over on Other Side IRC, and we do as well.

364
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Orange Lounge.

365
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,940
Some FUs from the chat room.

366
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,380
SoCalKicks says, fuck Pepsi Blue because it fucked up the camera that he borrowed from

367
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,520
his friend.

368
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,540
And I guess what he did is there's some kind of, it has a crappy cap on it, he says, that

369
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,460
I guess must have went flying and conked the camera in just the right way, that one of

370
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,980
the lines, the LED lines, doesn't work.

371
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,300
And now he's in deep poopy.

372
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,980
so uh... fuck you pepsi blue from socal kicks

373
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,780
uh... a big fuck you from black lab to a minute extended mix because it's the

374
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,020
song that he lost to on p a competition

375
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,000
so

376
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,980
fuck that song

377
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,060
you know uh... it only takes a minute girl from max two yes

378
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,180
uh...

379
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,060
well that's

380
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,460
what it's called extended mix whatever shut up brad

381
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,780
uh... another f u uh... idiots who get balloons and suck the helium out and get

382
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300
on the second pad

383
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,780
and talk without weird helium voice when i'm doing a cat up

384
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,460
that's from twenty three one six

385
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,220
i myself would find that quite humorous actually you know

386
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,180
cat is it's it's kind of you know

387
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,300
do you have to say it's it's getting a little repetitive you know it's get a

388
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,660
little boring

389
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,100
you know when the modifiers will shuffle it up enough you know get somebody on

390
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,500
their talk with helium. They should have that kind of... That's an idea for Wednesday, write

391
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:59,780
that down. The announcer starts speaking like he has a helium voice, that's what I do. That'd

392
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,580
be funny, like, you know, some sort of modifiers that get the announcer to make fun of me.

393
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,020
God, you fucking suck. Get out the damn pad. Yeah, what are you doing on the stage, you

394
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,660
crack whore? Don't even put your money in, you're going to fail anyway. Before you even

395
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,100
get on the machine

396
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,420
that reminds me of we borrowed a i'd just

397
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,420
recently acquired a jps you and got a copy of the are max that

398
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,820
is

399
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,620
theories crashed up so

400
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,240
you know when you choose a song it's already doing you

401
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,760
you have to take you to one

402
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,980
and it's all right i was going to go on and it's

403
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,000
it's it's not as a part of a combo mel had a combo about three hundred is

404
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,480
started booing him out of nowhere. It was great. It was like The Exorcist meets DDR.

405
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,080
Does it vomit pea soup if you get a certain combo?

406
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,920
Maybe out of the memory card slot. I didn't try that.

407
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,280
Ew. Maybe for a 666 combo.

408
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,560
There is vomit coming out of the slot. Okay, anyways.

409
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,440
Yeah, that would be pretty funny. Or even a great prank would be to hook up some sort

410
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,460
of microphone or something to the actual speakers and when people are going in to put in money

411
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,260
you start yelling through their own remote mics, say from the upper balcony from sun

412
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,260
splash and you're just yelling down, you suck, get off the stage, and they're like what the

413
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
hell?

414
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Well we can just do that from the balcony, we don't need a microphone.

415
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,200
No, that brings up an idea though that I thought about when they had a guitar freaks and drum

416
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
mania session is to have a microphone slot so you can do karaoke with them while they're

417
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,480
playing.

418
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,080
Of course, I wouldn't try to sing because I already know I suck, but Rob's really good.

419
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,160
We should play one of your songs, Rob.

420
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,720
No, we shouldn't.

421
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I'm...

422
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
SoCal kicks in the chat rooms being an attention whore, and he's whining that I'm not...

423
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,960
I didn't do his second part of his F.U. of the week, so here's his second part of the

424
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
F.U. week.

425
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,480
He says, fuck you to Echo for making $58 pants and $38 shirts.

426
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
He spent $270 there yesterday.

427
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
Well, if it bothers you, why didn't you spend $270 bucks?

428
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,920
That's what I don't get.

429
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Go to Walmart and get $14 jeans.

430
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Ross.

431
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Ross.

432
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
That's what I'm saying, dude.

433
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Ross.

434
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Target.

435
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Oh, I'm styling.

436
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
I'm representing when I'm wearing my...

437
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,480
Kmart has Joe Boxers now.

438
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,560
Sweet.

439
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,920
That's how you impress the ladies.

440
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Joe Boxer.

441
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Trust me.

442
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
Just look at me.

443
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,480
And uh, Tal gives a big F-you to guitar freaks.

444
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Because it's been broken.

445
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
For a few weeks.

446
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Okay, but that's what we want.

447
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Does anybody else have an F.U.?

448
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I think we've got all the F.U.'s.

449
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
How do I have an F.U.?

450
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
I have an F.U.

451
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Oh!

452
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm the special guest.

453
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Since you're the special guest, you get a song.

454
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
You get a song, too.

455
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
I have to find a song.

456
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
No, no, no.

457
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
We've already done Petite Love for somebody.

458
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Let's see.

459
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
What am I doing?

460
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Let's see.

461
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
What can I think?

462
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I'm like all bouncy.

463
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Okay, you know what?

464
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
You know what I'll give you?

465
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah!

466
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I'm going to give you Like A Virgin.

467
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
You are such a liar!

468
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Anyone who knows me knows this is a trap.

469
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Anyway, my F.U. of the week is to Santana Row in San Jose.

470
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Anyone who's in the Bay Area knows Santana Row is this gigantic complex.

471
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,480
It was going to be housing and shopping and all this shit.

472
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
It burned down.

473
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:33,480
You get to see this giant Santana Row opening September 19th with it in major flames in the background.

474
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,800
background we're talking 11 alarms biggest fire in San Jose's history now

475
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,560
the reason why this is a nephew of the week because I found out they were going

476
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,780
to be charging for these condos okay they have condos in there fifteen

477
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,960
thousand dollars a month who has that kind of money for a freaking condo every

478
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,680
month so you know what I don't feel bad for them anymore because if they can

479
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,560
find that kind of money to be charging for a condo they damn it they deserve it

480
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,280
to be burned down preach on sister they have like golden toilets in there or

481
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:15,000
I think we're going to go to a quick break and we'll come back and talk about some more

482
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
things.

483
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,600
We're going to talk about USAs going bye-bye, being replaced with some new machines locally.

484
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,960
We'll talk about that coming back from break.

485
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,280
I'm going to do a request this break, this is a request I said I do last week and I didn't

486
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,640
so my bad.

487
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,680
I'll do it this week tonight.

488
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,980
One other thing I did want to say before we go to break, when we said we're going to be

489
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,180
taping next week's show this Wednesday at Roseville Golf Land, some people said, why

490
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,200
don't you come out to the other golf lands?

491
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,840
Actually, over this next weekend, while I'm out of town, I'm actually going to be in the

492
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,060
bay, so it is very possible I'm going to be dropping into some golf lands.

493
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,440
I know I'm going to be hitting Sunnyvale Golf Land, I just don't know what day.

494
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Maybe Sunday, maybe not.

495
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
You're kicking something there, sweetie.

496
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Are you?

497
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Oh, no?

498
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Oh, okay.

499
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,400
wasn't the router, because then the show would have just gone bye-bye.

500
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,120
Anyway, yeah, I will be out doing some interviews at some of the Bay Area golf lands.

501
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,760
I just don't know where and I don't know when just yet, but it will be sometime next weekend.

502
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,600
I'll post an announcement somewhere appropriate when I know more about where I'm going to

503
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
be.

504
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,800
And if I run into you, I just might interview you for this program.

505
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,180
Alright, let's go to break here.

506
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,880
This is a request I meant to get to a few weeks, or last week, and I didn't, so here

507
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
it is.

508
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Radio.

509
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

510
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Take me any way you please

511
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Boy, you're making me scream

512
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,880
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

513
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,880
You gotta dream of your dream

514
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, I'll just turn it up

515
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,880
my friend No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get very honest is it

516
00:32:40,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Ooh, I like to dream, mama, do you like to scream?

517
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
There's nothin' left to check the screen

518
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
If you wanna check the screen

519
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Boy, you're makin' me scream

520
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Ooh la da dee la da da

521
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Check me any way you please

522
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
Boy, you're makin' me scream

523
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Ooh la da dee la da da

524
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:40,000
We don't stop, we rock the spot, no We don't stop, we rock the spot, no

525
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Everybody over there, hands in the air

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot

527
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
No, we don't quit, it's very hard to do it

528
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Dream a dream lover, take me in a dream

529
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Take me anywhere you please, boy you're making me scream

530
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Dream a dream lover, life is just a dream

531
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
If you wanna set me free, boy you're making me scream

532
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Ooh, ya da dee, la da da

533
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Check me any way you think

534
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
We're in the industry

535
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Ooh, ya da dee, la da da

536
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
You gotta dream of me today

537
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Come on baby, let's dream a dream together

538
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
A dream that is real

539
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:50,680
Dream a dream, nothing just a dream Take the every real thing, for you're making

540
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,760
me scream Dream a dream, nothing just a dream

541
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
If you want to let me be

542
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,760
Looking back when I was a child and dream

543
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Moving my journey without me

544
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Having faith it will set me free and fly away

545
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Looking back when I wasn't sure I'm clear

546
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Causing my family taking come to me

547
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Having faith it will set me free and fly away to

548
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Everywhere

549
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I could do anything

550
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,760
I can get up and I won't

551
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I get love from the one I love

552
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey baby, looking back when I wasn't shared and bled

553
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Those in my carry didn't come to me

554
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,660
Not if it's easy and if we don't fly away

555
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,920
I get so beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

556
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,040
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

557
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,280
portable

558
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,380
After a long time come to be a man

559
00:36:39,380 --> 00:37:01,540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

560
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, or at least most of you were.

561
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,020
I'm just hearing in the chatroom that there was a dump, and most of you got dumped, and

562
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,860
And I can tell that most of you got dumped because my listener count updated and there's

563
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,620
a whopping one person listening at this very moment.

564
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
And it's probably me.

565
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
It must count me.

566
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
We love you, one person.

567
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Yeah, we love you, one listener.

568
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
I don't know what happened.

569
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,800
Live 365 must have taken a dump or something and you all got dumped as a result of it.

570
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,540
So I apologize.

571
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,460
But it sounds like if you all reconnected, of course, obviously if you're hearing this,

572
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
you did reconnect.

573
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,060
So there's no point in me saying.

574
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,940
So tell anyone who was listening it got dumped that you got to reconnect and sorry about

575
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,380
So Cal Kicks says he's the one listener.

576
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,740
I don't know though, it updated and then he said he got dumped, so I don't know.

577
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,320
I think one person managed to stay connected and the other ones that we had on there dropped,

578
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
so I don't know.

579
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
That's crazy.

580
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,580
When you said you had to take a dump during the break, I didn't know.

581
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
Not like that.

582
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,220
High mouth humor.

583
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,940
So I've been trying to make some new promos for you.

584
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,460
You like the Captain Jack one?

585
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Alright, Melody about to pee her pants on there, that's good.

586
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,780
When Melody soils herself?

587
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
I don't know.

588
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,140
Well, I mean, it's good that she liked it so much, it's not, you know, if she peed her

589
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,700
pants that wouldn't really be a good thing, I'd have to, you know, clean the carpet and

590
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,940
get smell in here.

591
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,460
Can we go one night without potty humor?

592
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,900
No.

593
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,440
Potty humor, potty haaaat.

594
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:44,400
One thing we wanted to talk about, some news that we got this week.

595
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,080
At the Golf Land chain, which is a pretty big chain out here in the west coast of arcades

596
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,840
in California and Arizona, where one could argue that DDR was kind of born and nurtured

597
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,480
between the Golf Lands and the Metreon and some other locations like Arcade Infinity.

598
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,960
was one of the big players in getting DDR exposure. Most of their arcades have a Dance

599
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
Dance Revolution USA machine, and then some other kind of mix. Most of them have Max 2

600
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,080
by now, I believe. The news came over this week, and this still should be considered

601
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,320
a rumor until these machines are actually there and in place, but for all practical

602
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,100
purposes, it's pretty much been confirmed, all the USAs are going out and being replaced

603
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:33,660
with 4th Plus machines. So, which is good news because 4th Plus is a very cool mix.

604
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,980
It's much better than USA, that's for sure.

605
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,100
I don't know, man. I like USA.

606
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,940
You like your one foot songs, one foot freestyles, huh?

607
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,380
Man, what am I going to do now if I can't play anything greater than a one footer? I

608
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,940
mean, what am I going to do? I'm screwed.

609
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,780
You can't play B.O.L. over and over.

610
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,980
Does that mean that El Remo Tropical is going to finally get a rest? That they don't just

611
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,820
hit the first song that they see you know because if you we found this out

612
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,900
when we had fourth mix if you just keep hitting the first category that's up

613
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:14,300
have you never been mellow just like the old days so and apparently fourth plus

614
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,500
bootleg kits are only like $200 if even that 175 bucks I mean I'm being told in

615
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,940
chat room, so pretty darn cheap.

616
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
What do you think this means?

617
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,620
This is very interesting that USA is kind of disappearing, I guess there's always been

618
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,420
this kind of urban legend, urban Bimani legend, I don't think there's any truth to it personally,

619
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,300
but they've always kind of said that, oh well, Konami doesn't really mind the Max 2s and

620
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,080
the import mixes as long as they keep the USA machine there too, you know, they're kind

621
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,700
of supporting the USA Bimani.

622
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,140
look at Stockman Golf Land, they never had a USA machine, very true, very true, import

623
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,020
machines. Like I said, I think it was all just kind of hearsay, but you look at the

624
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,800
Metreon, they're not allowed to have anything but USA machines. You can argue the movie

625
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,300
theater upstairs has two Max 2s now, but they're not owned by the rest of the Metreon, they're

626
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,460
leased or whatever, so they don't have to play by those rules. You know what I think

627
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:14,140
about it? Bullshit! What, the bullshit that they had to have a USA for an import? Does

628
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,860
Does anybody else find it really odd that Konami, I mean Max 2 is, they are literally

629
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:23,260
everywhere now, everywhere, there's DDR everywhere and there's pretty much no USA machines left.

630
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,740
It's pretty obvious that Konami is not putting out a new USA mix anytime soon unless they

631
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,180
do it kind of out of thin air.

632
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,880
It's going to be something they announce and have out on the street within a month.

633
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,660
All the new USA stuffs for the home mix, obviously we had all that stuff a while back about Konami

634
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,660
closing their coin-op office and all this, but that doesn't mean, you know, that doesn't

635
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,660
I mean, Konami coin-op is shutting down completely. They're just going to have a third-party distributor, most likely.

636
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,660
Let's just put it this way. I mean, if you put a 1-5 machine and a USA machine next to each other, it's like comparing two JOGA songs.

637
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Sure, they're going to be a little bit different, but it's not much better. It's just pretty much the same thing.

638
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:07,660
So, it just, USA sucks. Everyone's tired of playing it. They're like, eh, oh, yay. I'm like, 20 songs I get to choose from.

639
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Let's see, 20 songs or like 100 and some songs? 20, 100 and something. That's a tough one.

640
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,660
I think, I mean, and plus you got Battle Mode. Battle Mode's cool.

641
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,660
Although the little kids will fail faster. So, you know, they'll get off the fucking machine so I can play.

642
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
So, yeah.

643
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
Yes.

644
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,660
Excellent.

645
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,980
Is this kind of weird to anyone else that Konami just doesn't seem to care, that the

646
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,860
economy of USA does not seem to care that all these Japanese mixers are coming in and

647
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
taking over?

648
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,420
And if they do put out a USA second mix, it's going to have to be damn good or else nobody's

649
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
going to blink an eye.

650
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,420
Well, it might not be that they don't care, but you know, Imports, sure, they're not bringing

651
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,060
money to KOA, but they're still getting exposure to it.

652
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
Exactly.

653
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
And bringing in the PlayStation.

654
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Exactly.

655
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,900
other places like we're used to having a million DDRs all over the place but

656
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,580
I'm sitting here thinking okay I have grandparents and family in the Midwest

657
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,580
and Missouri if I want to go back there anytime I'm not gonna be playing DDR

658
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,780
because there is none within like 75 miles of the town they live in and it's

659
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,660
one of the bigger towns back there some of these people only see it on their

660
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,060
vacation they only see it like if they're going on a trip for some reason

661
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,780
they don't have the option to just drive five minutes to a golf land and play DDR

662
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,700
they're gonna see an import but be like hey that's cool and go buy it for the US

663
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,980
playstation

664
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,400
it's kind of odd that they're using the japanese machines to do their promotion

665
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,460
for the u s a mixes i mean

666
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,080
it obviously if they don't profit from these u s mixes on on the home versions

667
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,920
they're not going to keep going with it

668
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,700
true but look what they have to work with

669
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,740
technically supposed to have to work with is the u s versions right

670
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,180
let's just put it this way how much does it cost licensed music in japan

671
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,320
versus how much does it cost very true which is a big thing to say here

672
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,560
although Max is going to be pretty cool because it's got 20 new licensed songs, not in any

673
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
other mix of DDR.

674
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,640
They knew that USA wasn't anything special or great or anything and I think that they

675
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,400
realized that all the imports are getting all the business and they're not even going

676
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,880
to bother because they know we're fine with all of the imports.

677
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,840
On a somewhat related subject, we have in the chat room, Roo makes a very good point

678
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
here.

679
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,000
Why is it that no one ever watches The Good People on Max 2, they always watch The Newbies

680
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,580
on USA. If you see a USA mix right next to a Max 2, nobody is ever watching. You could

681
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,360
be playing the hardest catastrophic on that. You could be playing Max Unlimited over on

682
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,520
the Max 2 machine. Somebody right next to you is doing so many men one-footer and they're

683
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,300
getting a huge crowd. Why is that? Because no one can read the arrows if they're new

684
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,520
to it and they're watching people doing catastrophic. The other thing I thought of is also, well

685
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Well, we all started back somewhere. It kind of brings us back to the nostalgia of,

686
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,520
wow, I remember when that song was hard, now look what I'm doing.

687
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,520
And a lot of people see a lot of Catastropics. There's honestly not that many newbies anymore.

688
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,520
They're just the people waiting up to go play.

689
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,520
And so, you know, you figure, okay, the guy that's playing the Catastropics

690
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,520
is probably going to pass this song, the next song, the song after that,

691
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
whereas the newbie is probably going to fail pretty soon.

692
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Who's going to get up to play first?

693
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,360
So you think it's kind of like an assembling of the wolves thing, like, let's watch them

694
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
fail.

695
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
You know?

696
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,720
Yeah, and that when you throw stuff at people, but yeah.

697
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,840
It's somebody else on Twitter, Black Lab says it could be American Pride, it's just they

698
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,680
see USA, it's just like, hey, it's a red, white, and blue mix, we gotta support that.

699
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,980
Yeah, on the next machine they put in, like on the fourth plus, they should say, fuck

700
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,200
you American capitalist pigs on the thing, so that they don't look at them anymore.

701
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Maybe they'll stop looking at us.

702
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Yeah.

703
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,160
like the attention I thought you were attention or bread no no no put down your

704
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,440
microphone Rob no but give me your microphone this is the Brad show all

705
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,040
Brad all the time thank you here I mean you can join you know what they should

706
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:10,560
put on the next mix of DDR and like country West on dancing oh no oh god he's

707
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:20,960
he's got a sound clip. Oh, he's gonna play something. Oh, sorry. I mean, didn't you just

708
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,920
hear this? Oh, damn it, Rob. I'm gonna burn down your trailer. What is that? Oh, it's

709
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:39,600
the all American DDR. You might be a rednecks. Does this version of DDR have like, you know,

710
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,320
cars on it too

711
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,600
yes it's DDR mixed with silent scope

712
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,400
DDR mix and duck hunt, thank you melody

713
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,000
complete with the dancing dog that you can't fucking kill no matter what you do

714
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
well they need to have in the background the guy calling out the square dance commands and stuff

715
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,840
in the background there

716
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,080
everybody do-si-do

717
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,200
up, down, up, down

718
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,200
word and

719
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,760
don't forget you have to like

720
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,520
drink and smoke too much

721
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,280
i'd just got booted from i r c so i have no idea if this broadcast is still

722
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,360
going i i think we are i think we're ok was to keep going like we're doing a

723
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,640
normal show will see what happens

724
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,040
who home do you know

725
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,520
if not it's one for the monday night archives i guess that

726
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,600
i don't know

727
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,880
which is odd because it's not even trying to reconnect that might just be

728
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,840
i r c blow up so uh... these connect will see

729
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,180
okay i don't know what's going on to keep going

730
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,300
uh... all of the show

731
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,380
so i was playing at the idea of the other day

732
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,780
i felt this weird feeling in my uh...

733
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:59,780
acts and i was like so max three hundred

734
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:05,780
Sorry, I'm sorry, but we're trying to remedy the IRC situation.

735
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,460
All I know is, I'm not very comfortable at this moment right now.

736
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,460
That's all I have to say.

737
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:16,020
Did you ever see that scene in Screamers where the guy's head exploded?

738
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,780
I'm having a very good time, people like me.

739
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:27,780
Thank you, I think that's what I was on, you need to do the other server.

740
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
Rob?

741
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Let Bradley take care of it.

742
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,780
Let Bradley work on the situation.

743
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,780
I'm kind of monitoring the broadcast to see if we lose our listeners again, because it might be us.

744
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,780
I don't know. We'll see.

745
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,780
Anyway.

746
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,780
Code red! Code red! The building's on fire!

747
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,780
And if you don't reconnect to IRC, I'm going to set the building on fire.

748
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,780
Okay, that's Milton from Office Space for anyone who didn't know.

749
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,780
It's been confirmed the Taliban have attacked Orange Lounge Radio.

750
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,780
hahahaha

751
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,020
do not be afraid

752
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,860
uh... we we got the i r c situation fixed a little underline everybody be

753
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,780
alert

754
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,920
are you alert

755
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,420
i'm alert

756
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,060
what is alert i want to know what alert what happens when she breaks down as

757
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,540
everybody goes nuts you know we have very alert

758
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,540
excuse me can i check we know about jamie here tonight it would all fall

759
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,340
apart so just you know

760
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,140
Fuck the show! Let's just have random quote night.

761
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,140
Maybe we should all go join her with a warp core breach in Vegas. Road trip!

762
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Little does Jamie realize we are standing behind her as she is seeing it right now. Won't she be surprised?

763
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,140
I'm hoping to get the phone thing so I really want the phones on this show because I want to be able...

764
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,340
I don't so much want people to be able to call us, but I want to be able to call other people.

765
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:53,340
I'm really skeptical of having random people call this show because there's, I mean, no

766
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,020
offense to anybody listening, because I'm sure you're all intelligent, but there's really

767
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,700
a lot of idiots out there in the Beaumont community I don't want calling this show.

768
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:06,540
Why don't you just have a phone in here and put it on speaker and dial out or something?

769
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,540
Yeah?

770
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,540
Well, I don't know.

771
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,880
It would sound kind of crappy.

772
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,740
It might work, but it would be kind of crappy.

773
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,020
But of course, we do have two microphones.

774
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,180
The only problem is, it might sound kind of weird for the person on the other end.

775
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:23,060
it might work, we could try it. Well, I could maybe borrow something that I have at work

776
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,180
that we could hook up to the phone line where we could plug it into. I always like it when

777
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,820
people want to steal things from work for the show. Oh, I'm sorry, long-term borrow.

778
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,820
Oh, borrow? I have a paper clip from work. Anyways, back on the... Our chat room is foaming

779
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,820
Anyways, um, back on the, uh...

780
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,820
Our chat room was foaming at the mouth with the idea of phones.

781
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,820
Here, I'll call, let's call, let's call.

782
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,820
Anyways, yeah, we should probably be back on the, uh, on topic here.

783
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,820
I remember, actually, something was said in the chat room that jolted...

784
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,820
Remember that thing I was trying to think of earlier that I couldn't think of,

785
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,820
why I wanted people to email me at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com?

786
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,820
No.

787
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,820
If...

788
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,820
Some people were listening last week to our dollar mendi coverage of that tournament that happened a couple weeks ago.

789
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,820
If you want to cover a local tournament in your area, if you've got a tape recorder, you can get some decent sound.

790
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:18,820
If you want to cover a tournament in your area, go ahead and make a 5-10 minute news piece on your local tournament.

791
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,820
And we'll feature it here on Orange Lounge Radio. If you can make an MP3 of it, send it to us.

792
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,820
Because we'd love to hear it. We don't want this to just be a California or Sacramento show.

793
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,820
This is for everybody, especially if you're not even in America at all.

794
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,820
If you're one of our listeners over in Europe or Japan or whatever,

795
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,820
Definitely, tape something over there and send it to us. We'd love to play it on the show.

796
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,820
Get in touch with me at OrangeLoungeRadio.Yahoo.com and we'll give you all the information.

797
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,820
In the chatroom, I know that you posted my edits. In fact, I saw that you didn't have the names on there,

798
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,820
so I sent you another email with the names. And they're also in the zip files, all the information about the edits.

799
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,820
Check that out.

800
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Well, I was still kind of going on this 4th Plus thing now that we realized we haven't lost the whole damn show.

801
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:08,100
Do you think 4th Plus is the best choice to replace USA or why?

802
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,780
Because it's like the best mix.

803
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,700
It's got like pretty much a little bit of everything.

804
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:19,820
You're going to find most of the songs from other mixes before 4th on there and it doesn't

805
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,620
have any of the crap songs on there.

806
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,980
Also a lot of stuff that was on 5th Mix or anything like that is already on Max 2 anyways.

807
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,820
Like most of the stuff that was good.

808
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,820
What about the fifth mix?

809
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,820
Yeah.

810
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,580
So, I mean, fourth plus seems pretty good.

811
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,820
I think it probably has one of the most, you know, the largest, you know, sound collections.

812
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,820
You're not going to miss all the third Koreans that get replaced?

813
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,820
Wah!

814
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
Wah!

815
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,820
Do they take out all the fifth Korean songs?

816
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,820
Well, only half.

817
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,500
You know, the non-third plus Korean songs like Starion, Hoggism, those ones are not

818
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
going to be there.

819
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Those weren't in fourth anyways.

820
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,500
Yeah, Baquah. They're in there. Yeah, fourth plus.

821
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Ooh, Baquah. Oh, yeah.

822
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Don't you just want to play beautiful 21C over and over and over and over?

823
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Because I know people that do that.

824
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
You know what?

825
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Oh, yeah.

826
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Oh, good point. Good point.

827
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Twen in the chat room says,

828
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,500
fifth mix is slightly better because it does not have let them move.

829
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Good point.

830
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,500
You'll just not play it.

831
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
But anyways.

832
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Yes, Brad.

833
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
I don't have anything to say.

834
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:36,500
the microphone. You don't ask for the microphone, you don't have anything to say. Let's play

835
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,580
what is this link I'm being sent in the chat room. I'm guessing it's for an upgrade to

836
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,620
fourth plus and showing how expensive it is. Ah no no, somebody is selling their screen

837
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:53,900
name of Satan. Super elite. You know what's funny is that one of my good friends is Morpheus

838
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:02,400
on AOL, and he's had this for years and years. Of course, right after The Matrix comes out,

839
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,900
about 50 different Neos start messaging the poor guy, you know, going, oh, I'm Neo, you're

840
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,500
Morpheus, where's the pills, da-da-da. Just like stupid 10-year-old kids thinking that,

841
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,700
you know, I don't know, a random thought. Actually, it's probably, like, 30-year-old

842
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,420
guys now, like, have nothing to worry about. Chatroom has a tendency to be able to derail

843
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,420
the show in like two seconds, flat.

844
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:28,900
If you want to join our chat room, any other side IRC server, channel poundorangelounge.

845
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,460
I have a different topic if- Go for it, what do you want to talk about?

846
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,220
I was thinking about another tournament here in Sacramento.

847
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,100
Okay, yeah, we want to do one, yeah, so.

848
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,060
So when are we going to do one?

849
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,900
Well, when the place is let us.

850
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:50,700
There's some things going on at one of the local arcades is looking into getting a brand

851
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,860
new machine you know what I'm talking about a very wanted machine but we don't

852
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,500
know if it's going out with kind of one of those things where we aren't trusting

853
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,740
the rumor until we see it for ourselves there in the arcade which is you know

854
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,560
what most people should do instead of spreading rumors um we're kind of

855
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,340
waiting to see if they get that machine because if they do get that machine we

856
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,900
want to have it there and do two kinds of tournaments do DDR and for the other

857
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,220
machine because there's a lot of demand for that kind of tournament I know what

858
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,220
That's what that new machine is.

859
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,220
Boonga Boonga.

860
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:26,220
Yes! Boonga Boonga Tournament. Very first. MAMBO Tournaments!

861
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,220
Okay, but no.

862
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:43,220
But anyway, what about our Bimani liaison that's over at RVGL that's supposed to be set up a tournament.

863
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,060
knows how to set up a tournament, but I smelled alcohol in his breath.

864
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,060
No, I'm just kidding.

865
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
I didn't.

866
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,060
I didn't.

867
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,060
Sorry, what?

868
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,060
Did he drink vanilla coke?

869
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,940
Would you please explain the vanilla coke and alcohol joke for our listeners?

870
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,380
Okay, so Irene is sitting here as we're coming into the show with a glass of vanilla coke

871
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,500
and ice asking everyone, does this taste like alcohol?

872
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,860
We're trying to figure out if someone spiked your vanilla coke.

873
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
We're still not quite sure.

874
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:11,020
It was like, seriously, I've never had vanilla coke with ice in it before, but it tastes

875
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,020
It's so strange now. It seems like someone put alcohol or GHB or something in it.

876
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
I'm kidding.

877
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,020
I gave you the date rape drug, Irene.

878
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,020
I want to go to my room and get fresh.

879
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,020
Oh, that's how you got pregnant.

880
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:38,020
Well, we weren't going to mention it now, but next segment, Irene's going to be on our webcam.

881
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,020
Hey, we have to earn the money to play those songs somehow.

882
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,020
Yeah, okay, yes, oh yeah, oh yeah, that topic, yes.

883
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,020
Yes, Irene.

884
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,020
Isn't it kind of boring to have PA and freestyle anymore?

885
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,020
Well, I think it's kind of one of those things where you have to.

886
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:03,020
I like the idea of doing PA, freestyle, and then something experimental, or at least kind of shaking up the rules enough that it keeps it interesting, you know?

887
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,460
as opposed to like, you know,

888
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,260
we're just gonna qualify in the top 16, I'll play head-to-head,

889
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,300
and then we'll have a winner. Wild Jerble PA.

890
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,540
What?

891
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,140
Wild Jerble PA.

892
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,100
You're just gonna let loose Wild Jerbles on the machine?

893
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,980
Or if somebody messes up, it's just gonna be BOOM!

894
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,300
Boonga Boonga!

895
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,980
Oh yeah. You know, I'm thinking like, you know,

896
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,940
routines are good.

897
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,140
You know, people can spend a lot of time and prepare

898
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,640
their routines instead of someone going up, oh, you know, I think I'm the shit and I'm

899
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,960
just going to pay my five dollars in PA or something. I think routines. We should focus

900
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,260
strongly on routines. Like, you know, people actually thinking of something to do and,

901
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,560
you know, making it look nice and stuff as opposed to someone just doing hand slaps and

902
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,960
all that stupid shit.

903
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,440
I agree. We saw some real shitty routines at SCAT and that's because I can tell you

904
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,160
why. It was from the people who would get up there at the registration desk, because

905
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,120
I was sitting there at the registration desk, and there would be those people that would

906
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:07,120
up and go, well I don't know if I should enter improv freestyle or routine freestyle. Well,

907
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,960
what song could I do a routine to? It's like eleven o'clock that morning and they're just

908
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,000
going to pull a routine out of their butt, they have no step charts with them.

909
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,600
I don't know anything, I don't know what you're talking about there Rob, it's not like I got

910
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,040
up there thinking I had memorized the song and it fucked it all up.

911
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,560
It's wonderful because if you saw Loki enter the tournament I think he was one of two people

912
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:35,520
to fail his song. And he actually knows the song he was doing by heart, and he knows it

913
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:42,080
on stealth and everything. I'm sad to see that you, by technicality, place underneath

914
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,080
some of those other people, but you know, it's just technicality.

915
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:58,800
I was thinking, like, maybe we can have a DDR Couples routine thing.

916
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,880
Well, you've seen that done before, like, you mean like, couples who sleep together?

917
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,800
Yes, couples that suck.

918
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,720
But you know, this is the thing.

919
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,120
Well, you got them, she's suggesting that Rice Princess and Michael Stoudier are a couple.

920
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
Yeah, I don't know about that.

921
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,120
A couple of what? I don't know.

922
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,120
A group thing.

923
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,120
What? What the what?

924
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,120
No, okay, this is what I was thinking.

925
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,120
Yeah, sweetie, I get it.

926
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,120
Shut up.

927
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
I don't know if our bed's big enough.

928
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,120
Hey, punch you in your throat.

929
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
Whoa, shit.

930
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:38,120
What I was going to say is that this is going to sound very discriminating, but there is a reason why I would say it.

931
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,240
i would think only that the couples and it would only be

932
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,080
male female

933
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,520
and only because you know that there's going to be to go later pater no no no

934
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,160
this is why here's my rationalization discriminator your discriminator here

935
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,920
might be

936
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,560
too

937
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,240
really good guys that are going to pretend to be

938
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,980
day or something and what i entered together

939
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,780
and you know do some routine and blow away everyone else

940
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,200
the only that's all

941
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,720
blow up a little a hot hot hot

942
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,640
the only issue i see with that though is that you know male-female

943
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,040
honestly there aren't that many female freestylers out there so it kinda makes it kinda difficult

944
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,880
but hey i think i'd pay money to see mel b act gay with some other guy

945
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,780
hahahaha

946
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,380
that was not good

947
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,500
okay once again mel b is not gay

948
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,260
i know he's not i have proof to you but i'd pay money to watch him act that way

949
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,660
just watch him pop pop

950
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,660
Oh, you're right. I saw that.

951
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,660
What about females and females?

952
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,660
You know, two females wanted to get on there and do some secret rendezvous action.

953
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,660
No, I'm kidding.

954
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,660
Hater!

955
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,660
No, no, no.

956
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Homophobe!

957
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,660
No!

958
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
I hate you!

959
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,660
I hate you, Rob!

960
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,660
Sit down. You don't know me.

961
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
Why do they get silent all of a sudden?

962
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,660
Every time I talk.

963
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,660
God.

964
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,660
Fuck you, log!

965
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
Is that such an inside joke?

966
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,660
No.

967
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,660
Unfortunately, no, we haven't dropped.

968
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,660
Actually, we're at a ratings peak right now, I don't know why.

969
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,660
We haven't brought up shirtless Emi or anything, but somehow...

970
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:14,660
No, that's three-titted Emi, okay? Get it right.

971
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:20,660
Speaking of which, Konami hasn't released any more of the DDRPC characters.

972
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,660
Very disappointing.

973
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,660
Valencia and Guy, last week. Pack number two did come out last week.

974
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,660
We covered that last week. I'm talking about number 3.

975
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,660
We thought they'd be doing them every Friday and they missed a Friday. Shame, shame.

976
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,660
It'll probably be out on Monday instead.

977
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,660
They're trying to get Paul Terry to do the motion capture.

978
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,660
What do you want to bet Paul Terry is one of the unlockable characters?

979
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,660
Nice.

980
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Shirtless, three-titted Paul Terry.

981
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
nayoki and polla terry

982
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,660

The second one.

990
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,660
The second one.

991
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:40,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think that's...well whatever.

992
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:56,040
Let's go.

993
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
Re-Re-Remix

994
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:10,680
We need this...

995
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:55,680
Solid snake, solid snake, solid snake, can you hear what I'm saying?

996
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,680
Roll it down the ticker, man, they want you back

I'm gonna kick your asses, beat them, kill them all

998
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:08,280
Dom, what am I gonna do?

999
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,980
I've heard of a thing called Game Like This.

1000
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:53,980
I want to see you turn around Make sure I reach out

1001

1013
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,380
what I'm gonna do I gotta warn you

1014
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:01,540
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1015
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:05,700
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1016
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:13,740
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1017
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,140
You wanted to add something to that, Irene?

1018
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,580
Oh yeah, I was going to say that this last break was brought to you by the letter N.

1019
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,580
Yep.

1020
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,900
And why is that?

1021
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,580
Oh, because all the songs, their titles started with M.

1022
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,180
Oh, very good.

1023
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,620
Would you like to name those songs for our listening audience?

1024
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,260
No.

1025
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,340
OK, then I will.

1026
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,540
You heard Metal Gear Solid from Beatmania III

1027
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,100
by the Spaceyo Brothers.

1028
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,620
Metal Gear Solid II Mission R by LED from Beatmania VI PlayStation.

1029
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,540
From 2DX Fest Style, Orange Lounge, our favorite with Mobile Moga.

1030
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,300
and uh... a little clip of max don't have sex with your acts two thousand two

1031
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,820
by erotic

1032
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:55,940
and thanks so-called kickster sending out one of the and then begging me over

1033
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,320
and over again to play it so there you go

1034
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,700
uh...

1035
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,860
let's talk to melody she's our special guest here tonight

1036
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:08,420
melody yours your special tonight

1037
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,780
uh... you put them i couldn't click just pretend you know we're gonna get some

1038
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:20,700
head there. There you go. You got to get nice and close to your mouth. Wow! Thank you. I

1039
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:29,780
appreciate that. You don't have to. Yes. So you happen to be a machine owner, correct?

1040
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:34,540
Yes, I am. Now, because there's a lot of people's fantasies to own their own machine, you know,

1041
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,860
I don't know what they, as they're thinking about late at night, as they're following

1042
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:42,860
Is it everything it's cracked up to be?

1043
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:47,860
Does this machine vibrate?

1044
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:52,860
If you jump on it really hard, yes it does.

1045
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:57,860
Anyone?

1046
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,860
What made you want to get a DDR machine?

1047
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,860
I like DDR and Mel needed to get rid of it.

1048
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:12,860
So I talked really nice with my mom and said, Mom, I need money.

1049
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,860
She gave me money and I bought it.

1050
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,860
I did it the lazy way.

1051
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,860
How often do you use it?

1052
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,860
It kind of depends on what I'm doing.

1053
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,860
If I'm kind of busy during the week, I'm like, eh, whatever.

1054
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,860
Now you have a Solo 2000 machine, correct?

1055
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:28,860
I have a Solo 2000.

1056
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:34,860
Since you got your Solo 2000 machine, have you played Solo 2000 in the arcade at all?

1057
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,860
No, because there's only one in San Jose, and I don't know where it is even.

1058
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,860
It's in the middle of a Super Kmart, I think.

1059
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,860
You know, they just got a brand new one right at the street here in the mall.

1060
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:48,860
Yeah, I should probably look at that, but why pay for it when I can set it to six songs for free?

1061
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,860
Well, honestly, I'm just curious, because a lot of people say,

1062
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,860
oh, even if I had a machine at home, I'd probably still play in the arcade occasionally.

1063
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:02,860
Now, of course, you do play in the arcade still Max 2 because it's not the same as Solo 2000.

1064
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,860
There's almost nothing, you know.

1065
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:11,860
Solo has a lot of songs that don't appear on any other mix, like My Baby Mama, stuff like that.

1066
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,860
So, you know, strut your funky stuff and lots of stuff.

1067
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:16,860
And it's not like you can play 6 panel.

1068
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,860
That's Glenn's favorite song.

1069
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:22,860
It's not like you can play 6 panel much anywhere else, too, which I'm just teaching myself how to do.

1070
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,580
I play it normally, it depends on what I'm doing, I can play it anywhere from every day

1071
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:32,980
in a week to not even once a week, but it's just in my backyard, I'm bored I'm going to

1072
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:33,980
go play DDR.

1073
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,940
Are you looking into getting any of the upgrades possibly, like a fourth mix plus?

1074
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,520
Eventually, maybe.

1075
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,380
If I can find a way to keep the Solo 2000 preserved, because I like it, it's a rare

1076
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:47,220
enough machine that you're not going to find it everywhere on every street corner, so if

1077
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,700
there's a way to preserve it and I get money, you know, providing I ever find a job, yeah

1078
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,720
I probably will do something with it.

1079
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,900
You know how I was telling you a little earlier off the air before the show, Melody, they

1080
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:02,500
have a bootleg, or I don't know if it's bootleg or what, I think it's bootleg, a 5th mix upgrade

1081
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,740
for a solo machine.

1082
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:09,620
I'm actually being given a link to a website here that shows you how to upgrade your DDR

1083
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,300
5th mix to a solo.

1084
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,380
Wait a second, 5th to solo or solo to 5th?

1085
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:20,760
Upgrade your DDR solo 2000, 4th mix or 4th mix plus machine to DDR solo 5th mix.

1086
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,760
So I never knew that you could do that.

1087
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,800
I thought that you couldn't do that.

1088
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,260
It must be some kind of interesting hack to it.

1089
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,880
So it's definitely not official.

1090
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,720
This site is not official looking at all that I'm looking at.

1091
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,600
And I'm not going to endorse it over the air, because they can pay me if they want that.

1092
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,960
It's not like the solos had hell anyway, considering it's been broken and it had to be sent to

1093
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,080
KOJ to be fixed.

1094
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,480
So apparently it's about $1,000 if you want to upgrade that puppy.

1095
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,480
That's kind of a lot.

1096
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,320
another solo for On the Cheap and I could do it that way, upgrade one that I don't care

1097
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,320
about.

1098
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,920
Back to the original thought, it's really easy to just hop out there and kind of play

1099
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,240
whatever I want and amazingly I haven't had anyone really over to play it yet.

1100
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,880
I keep saying, yeah, you want to come over and play solo for free, but the schedule's

1101
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,880
never really worked out.

1102
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,880
I'm coming next weekend.

1103
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Oh, so you want to come over?

1104
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,540
Yes, I'm going to come play solo for free and maybe we can do something and tape something

1105
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,540
for the show, so I don't know.

1106
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,540
Hey, that works.

1107
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,540
We'll see what we can do.

1108
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,220
You keep it outside? Yeah, actually you can keep a DDR machine outside as long as it's

1109
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,260
undercover and you take good care of it. I've got the pad

1110
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,580
I've got the pad and the bar because I have the one that actually has the bar

1111
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,740
and the real pad, not that raised shit.

1112
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:32,980
But, yes, I have an actual bar on

1113
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,820
the machine and it's an actual single pad. But as long as you just keep that covered up and keep the rest of it

1114
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,820
just careful, hey,

1115
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:42,700
it's fine. It's survived a winner already outside. Plenty of people in the chat room are

1116
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,380
saying, I'll come play, I'll come play!

1117
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,380
Do I need to give out my DDR frames to DM me?

1118
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,380
Hey, money talks, you know?

1119
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:53,380
Have you found ways to make money off the machine?

1120
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,380
No, I'm the only one who plays it, so...

1121
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,380
You don't take it out to make appearances to places?

1122
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,380
Eventually that might be in the works.

1123
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:05,380
Not really that there are some ideas that are being kicked around with using it in conjunction with some other things.

1124
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,380
That might eventually happen, might not.

1125
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,380
What's that place that the other one got kicked out of?

1126
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,380
San Diego!

1127
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,620
place it there, and make a little money off of that.

1128
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,500
I thought the idea was, I think this was actually an idea that came up on the show,

1129
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,000
I think this is something Jamie suggested a few episodes back,

1130
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,920
that we get a truck, get your solo machine if you're willing, board it up on the

1131
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,360
truck,

1132
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,800
drive down to San Diego, and play at the parking lot all day long.

1133
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,140
See, that's one of the reasons why I'm glad my machine is not listed in machine

1134
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,420
locations. When I saw that, I almost was ready to email that chick and be like,

1135
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,780
I dare you to take away my solo, bitch.

1136
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,580
they're saying in the chat room we should go on a California tour

1137
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:45,260
Orange Lounge, we'll just put the machine in the back of a truck and get a go

1138
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,500
that you know that might actually be I think we need to do we need to look into

1139
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,420
something like this like when all the Christmas parades come up

1140
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:58,180
we should enter like the orange lounge crew or something we get a DDR float

1141
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,220
get some of us playing on the solo machine that would be awesome

1142
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:04,780
and we'll have drinks with arrow shaped ice like I found

1143
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,540
I found an ice cube tray that's arrows

1144
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,420
we'd have the Shriner guys drive around in little carts right in front of us

1145
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,940
behind us we'd have the high school cheerleaders going woo woo

1146
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:20,060
you know and then right at D.D. Arnold's. If we have high school cheerleaders back there half the guys are going to be looking at that and not the arrows on the

1147
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,260
screen you know this

1148
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:27,020
get a U-Haul that's an idea. Get a U-Haul and have a mini tourney inside the truck I think you

1149
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,740
might click yourselves it's kinda

1150
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:33,020
asking for trouble or the machine. Don't let me drink it. Oh you want to say something

1151
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,140
Joe? I don't know he was kinda doing this I wasn't sure if he was doing

1152
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:39,140
Fight the power! Fight the power!

1153
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,140
Those cheerleaders, they need to be dressed up like the nurse from I'm Alive.

1154
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Should we get them giant syringes so they can ride up and down on them?

1155
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:56,140
Oh! You know what, Melody, you and Irene, let's get you some syringes.

1156
01:16:56,140 --> 01:17:00,140
We might be able to get Jamie a nice syringe to ride up and down on.

1157
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,140
Actually, I'll tell you what, Jamie, I'm sure would love to do her Emmy cosplay.

1158
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:09,140
cosplay she's got a great Emmy costume she could do are we dorks or what better

1159
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,620
yet next year we could do the pride parade because everybody knows that DDR

1160
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:17,340
is really gay so we you know that the thing about getting I'm kidding

1161
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,460
backpedaling here a little bit but the thing about the ad that you haul and

1162
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,740
playing a tournament you all that brings up an idea for a new type of attorney PA

1163
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:30,980
thing PA while you're accelerating and decelerating and stuff from 50 to 60

1164
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,340
miles an hour, then stomp on the brakes and try to not...

1165
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,980
...backing up in here, roommates garage.

1166
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,900
Hey, inside joke.

1167
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,580
PA on Bay Area highways.

1168
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,620
That would add an entire new element of difficulty to it.

1169
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,260
If you win, you get to stay on the truck.

1170
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,460
If you lose, out the window you go.

1171
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,900
Yeah, if you win, you survive.

1172
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Roll, grandma, roll.

1173
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,300
Make sure you roll when you hit the ground, right?

1174
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:05,300
I could insert a lame stop, drop, and roll joke here from the last tournament, but none of you were there, so I wouldn't get a laugh from this room.

1175
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,300
Oh, you were there, right? Yes.

1176
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
I would laugh. All right, there you go.

1177
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Okay, then. Remember, stop, drop, roll.

1178
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1179
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,300
That was a classic Orange Lounge moment brought to you by...

1180
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,300
Yes, Melody. Melody as well.

1181
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:28,140
Eventually, as far as I know, a Solo 2000 tournament might be a possibility, and hey,

1182
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:33,180
I know a Solo 2000 that could be used for it, if people bribe me.

1183
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,820
Everyone drop me a PM.

1184
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,980
Oh, should I spell the name?

1185
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:44,060
They say that with throwing people off the truck thing, rate the bar for dear life, because

1186
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,060
your Solo has a bar.

1187
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,540
Hold on to the bar for dear life.

1188
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:50,540
Hey, I've got a bar on there.

1189
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:54,620
I'm already getting sponsorship offers here from various websites that want to promote

1190
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,860
the DDR in a U-Haul tourney.

1191
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,620
Alright, hey, how about this?

1192
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:05,540
Now speaking of raping the bar and stuff, we could put, okay, for our next PA tournament,

1193
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:10,740
we could put a nice little hot wire attached to the bar so when someone goes to grab the

1194
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,660
bar, they're met with a nice little jolt.

1195
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,660
Zap?

1196
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,660
You know what?

1197
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,660
That's not a bad idea.

1198
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:22,300
We should do that for the next Sacramento tournament, for a perfect attack, we can hook

1199
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:27,140
up a little, you can do that with like a battery thing, hook it up to the bar, and just a little,

1200
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,660
you know, if you touch the bar, you get a little zap.

1201
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:34,500
Yeah, bolt two, bolt two, motherfucker.

1202
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,500
You're a dork.

1203
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Oh, surprise!

1204
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,500
Surprise!

1205
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,500
Hey, look at my shirt.

1206
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,500
I got this new shirt.

1207
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
I see your shirt.

1208
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,740
For the people in the radio land who can't see it, it's an 8-bit theater shirt, my wonderful

1209
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,420
Irene got this from me, this is wonderful.

1210
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:52,220
Everybody at the store stares at me and goes, what a dork.

1211
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,100
But they did that anyway.

1212
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,740
The chat room is saying it would be like that pain station pong game, have you heard of

1213
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,740
this?

1214
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,740
That pong game that you play?

1215
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:03,900
And if you fuck up and the ball gets out of the zone, you get zapped.

1216
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,900
Your finger gets zapped.

1217
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,900
This is a real thing?

1218
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,900
It's the pain station.

1219
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,900
Yes.

1220
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,900
It was some Dutch guy I think came up with it.

1221
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,740
If you can give me a link to that article, I'd love to look at that.

1222
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,860
We came up with an idea of Timmy and me or something like that.

1223
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:18,100
It was a Beatmania with a foot at the bottom, and when you messed up, the foot would kick

1224
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,380
you in the groin.

1225
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,380
Didn't we come up with that?

1226
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,500
That was like our second episode or something.

1227
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,180
We said the DDR would have the vibrating foot.

1228
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,340
This is something I thought I'd go on.

1229
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:34,140
Any other thoughts on tournaments?

1230
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:37,640
Machine ownage or I don't know.

1231
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,740
Machine ownage is cool.

1232
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,100
Do it.

1233
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,780
Everybody should buy their own machine.

1234
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,780
Yeah.

1235
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,780
To do it, press A.

1236
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,780
Oh, I've been given a link to the pain station.

1237
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,780
But seriously, it is pretty cool to be able to just say,

1238
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,780
I want to play DDR, I don't want to have to deal with anyone,

1239
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,780
I don't want to have to deal with lines,

1240
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,780
I'm going to go outside and play it.

1241
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,780
And honestly, if I could get it inside somehow I would,

1242
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,780
but in my house that just doesn't really happen because I own too much crap.

1243
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:07,780
Okay, the pain station is basically a game of Pong.

1244
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,780
The only difference is that if you lose,

1245
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,500
the pain execution units will hurt you.

1246
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,180
Pain execution units?

1247
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,100
There's a heat lamp which burns your hand,

1248
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,340
an electrical circuit which shocks the hand,

1249
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,300
and a whip which rapidly whips the same part of your hand

1250
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,540
over and over very fast with a wire.

1251
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:28,020
Says Volkar Marwau, co-creator of the Pain Station.

1252
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,060
I keep wanting to say PlayStation.

1253
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,740
And why did this become popular?

1254
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,860
We can't help but wonder what the designers were going for

1255
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:36,340
when they came up with this torture game machine.

1256
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,340
It's the PlayStation for Sato-Masticus all over again.

1257
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:45,340
Morale says, I was always interested in combining computers and the real world, and I wanted to create a computer game.

1258
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:49,340
We decided we would do a game with pain, and we picked Pong because it's easy to play.

1259
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:55,340
The pain station brings in the body and makes you feel the media, so it's a new experience.

1260
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:04,340
They've tried it before with the biofeedback and rumble packs, so it's a logical progression to go from rumble pack to, you know, being whipped in your finger.

1261
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,340
Because there's more to video games than nice graphics.

1262
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,340
Can I make a comment?

1263
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,340
Yes.

1264
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,340
They already have this, it's called Chrono Cross.

1265
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,340
Hahahaha.

1266
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,340
Wah wah wah.

1267
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:22,340
Is that what happens when people on the street are calling you all about the player?

1268
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,340
You know, you're the player who's putting in lashes and you have to like, walk to me.

1269
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:28,340
Oh wait, Brad, this is for you.

1270
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,340
There you go.

1271
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,340
Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night.

1272
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:37,340
Take my wife please.

1273
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,340
You're married?

1274
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,340
Not anymore.

1275
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:47,260
Oh, oh, Brad you got from SoCalCakes, you got a, oh no you didn't just diss Chrono Cross,

1276
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,260
oh no you didn't.

1277
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,260
Okay, okay, okay.

1278
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,260
Oh no you didn't.

1279
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:54,900
Let me explain, I don't need to feel like I have to, but Chrono Cross is a good game,

1280
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,500
but you can't compare it to Chrono Trigger, just don't even try, I'm sorry.

1281
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,500
It's a good game.

1282
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,500
For me to poop on.

1283
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,500
There you go, thank you.

1284
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,060
I haven't played it enough to form an opinion.

1285
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:14,060
Radio light is common. There's usually about a 30 second delay between us and the chat room hearing it.

1286
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:17,060
So, topic?

1287
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,060
You want a new topic?

1288
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,060
Should we?

1289
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,060
There is a topic?

1290
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,060
Topic?

1291
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,060
Can we talk on the show?

1292
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:23,060
Topic.

1293
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:27,060
Alright. Let's talk about...

1294
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,060
I can go over what's going on.

1295
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,060
Oh, I know what I want to talk about.

1296
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:31,060
Or we can do what you want to talk about.

1297
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,060
Well, what do you want to talk about?

1298
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:35,060
You go ahead. We'll talk about your subject. We'll take a break. We'll come back and do what I want to talk about.

1299
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:38,060
Okay, well, brief, uh, Sim World update here.

1300
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,060
Alrighty.

1301
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:47,060
Okay, uh, Turning Mix still going on, um, for some reason the files are still down, so I have to wait for those to come back.

1302
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:57,060
Um, NMR of, uh, Team Guilo is actually going to be posting, supposedly pretty soon, a, um, all the EuroMix 2 DWIs.

1303
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:01,060
So that'd be pretty cool, we'll get to play the EuroMix 2 tracks, you know, over here.

1304
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:08,060
And that's pretty much it. No new simulators out there. There's been a couple actual...

1305
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:14,060
There's a new DWI FileMaker, but I haven't gotten to try that yet.

1306
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,060
That's about it. Pretty boring.

1307
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,060
Okay, and Robby, would you want to talk about that?

1308
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,060
Alright, great. Oh, yes. DarkTootoo, do you want to say something?

1309
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:29,060
Yes, I just wanted to mention that I was working on some new result screen skins for Bomania DX, featuring the...

1310
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:36,060
Well, I took the skins from 2DX style and created skins with them.

1311
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,060
Cool. Right on.

1312
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:45,060
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and I'm going to start off with a little remix that was sent to me.

1313
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,060
This was something I was talking about earlier in the show.

1314
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:51,060
Twenn did this and it's called Let Them Paranoia and it's very scary.

1315
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,060
Wait till you hear it. Here we go, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1316
01:24:54,060 --> 01:25:01,060
go.

1317
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:59,060
Let's not move on

1318
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:04,060
Let's not move on

1319
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:20,060
Let's not move on

1320
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:24,060
Let's not move on, let's not move on

1321
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:55,000
uh... big thanks to twin for that two minutes of hell

1322
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
uh... back to some music we hope you like your own response radio

1323
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:11,140
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does No, nobody does, yeah, baby

1324
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:16,140
Ma yah, baby, yah, yah, yah, yah

1325
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:21,140
Baby yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

1326
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:26,140
Can't save me, can't save me

1327
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:31,140
Bye bye baby balloon

1328
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:36,140
Bye bye baby balloon

1329
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:41,180
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1330
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:45,540
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 10.

1331
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:48,420
They said we would never make it... your mic is on, right?

1332
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,760
Yes, okay, thank you.

1333
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,040
You are listening to episode number 10.

1334
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,360
They said we would never get past episode number 2, and here we are into double digits.

1335
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,360
Episode number 10.

1336
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,500
I wish Jamie was here to celebrate in this moment as well, but I know she's off having

1337
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,140
a great time, and so...

1338
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:06,380
Still have her warp core breeze, we'll have our alcoholic vanilla coke.

1339
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,700
That's right.

1340
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,380
So next week is going to be, we're calling it episode ten and a half.

1341
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,420
It's not really going to, because we're not here in this video, so it's going to be episode

1342
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,420
ten and a half.

1343
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,980
But then in two weeks we'll come back to episode eleven.

1344
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,900
All new intro, all new, everything.

1345
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,980
It's almost going to be like we're giving the whole show a face look.

1346
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:24,620
Why are you going to have a new intro?

1347
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:25,680
Keep things fresh.

1348
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,680
Keep things lively.

1349
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,680
New.

1350
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:28,680
You've only had ten shows.

1351
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,140
Well, it's just, I want a new intro.

1352
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,820
You know how many times I've ever heard that intro?

1353
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:33,820
It's a completely selfish thing.

1354
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,500
I've had to hear that intro too many times.

1355
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,740
Because I can make it better.

1356
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,660
But it's a good, why fix it if it ain't broke?

1357
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,660
But we're going to...

1358
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,620
Because I'm a man, and I like to do that.

1359
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:46,340
Our new intro is going to feature Polteri!

1360
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,620
Yay!

1361
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,940
Okay!

1362
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,980
Anyway, oh okay.

1363
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,980
This was something I was thinking about a little bit earlier today.

1364
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,780
I know, I was thinking, imagine that.

1365
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:59,340
DDR on the Game Boy.

1366
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,340
Have you ever seen this?

1367
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:07,340
What the fuck is the point? Can somebody explain to me what the fuck is the point of DDR on the Game Boy?

1368
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:12,340
Those who can't afford to get the cool stuff, they have to go with the crappy stuff.

1369
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:22,340
Okay, now wait. Come on, we play DDR like button-button revolution. There's not much difference. Oh, except for the, what is that, a 3-bit sound processor. I guess that is a kind of...

1370
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:33,340
Well, it's for those people out there that are just hardcore DDR players that need smoking and having the patch on at the same time. You just can't get enough of it.

1371
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:44,340
So, you're willing to settle for the little Game Boy version, too, when you're driving to the actual arcade or that kind of thing?

1372
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:51,340
New tournament thing. Bring in your Game Boy DDR thing and play the song on the Game Boy and the arcade at the same time.

1373
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:53,340
And we tie your score together.

1374
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,340
That's so cool!

1375
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,340
The combination of the score.

1376
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,340
No, it's not.

1377
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,340
You're right, it's not.

1378
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,340
Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to make it sound exciting.

1379
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,340
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1380
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,340
No, no.

1381
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:05,340
I thought we could play some game here in the studio.

1382
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,340
Okay.

1383
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:10,340
Because I don't know if you guys have ever heard the Game Boy renditions of your favorite DDR tunes.

1384
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,740
tunes. I thought maybe we could play some of those tunes and see how long it's going

1385
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,420
to take you guys to guess what the songs actually are.

1386
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:18,980
Name that tune, DDR style?

1387
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:24,180
It's name that tune, DDR Game Boy style. We're going to hear some of these. Anybody

1388
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:28,060
can answer, so when you think you know, I'm going to set this mic down, and when you think

1389
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:32,300
you know, grab the mic and say the answer, okay? I'm just going to set it down and don't

1390
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,740
grab it until you know the answer, okay? Now, don't look on the computer screen at the name

1391
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,820
because it does come up on the screen, but I'm going to trust you. We're using the on

1392
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:46,220
your honor system okay kids you're on your honor okay there's a there's a jar

1393
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:50,260
full of mints for the retard society and it says on your honors that's what we're

1394
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:59,820
doing here okay oh yes I'm gonna put it down

1395
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:17,100
I'm going to start off with a really easy one, okay?

1396
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,100
Something from Naoki.

1397
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,100
No.

1398
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,100
Butterfly?

1399
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Yeah.

1400
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,540
Yeah, I rule, that's right, uh-huh.

1401
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,180
I'm that geeky, woo!

1402
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:34,180
i was going to get the but you know that

1403
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,380
uh... yay

1404
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,820
like the new song

1405
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:53,820
all right

1406
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,740

1407
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:05,740
and you are there we not

1408
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:09,700
rock

1409
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:16,700
I've got the funk in my trousers for sure!

1410
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:24,060
Next song please!

1411
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,060
Whoo-hoo!

1412
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,060
My Summer Love?

1413
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:45,060
It was like, I knew it, but I was like, shit, what is it?

1414
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:50,060
I hope you all enjoyed the Mr. T rendition of My Summer Love.

1415
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,060
Is the mic on the ground?

1416
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,060
Here we go.

1417
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,060
Alright.

1418
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,060
Doobie Dub.

1419
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,060
Doobie Dub.

1420
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,060
You know what I mean, goddammit.

1421
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:09,060
Alright.

1422
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,060
Sounds stupid.

1423
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,060
I can't think fast enough.

1424
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:20,060
Yeah, here we go, here we go.

1425
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,900
Dream a dream.

1426
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:23,820
Yes.

1427
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:30,260
See, the solo comes in good for something.

1428
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:37,260
Fortunately, you get NOTHING!

1429
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:50,380
That's paranoia!

1430
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:57,380
Oh, it's dropout!

1431
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,900
AM3P!

1432
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,460
How long is it?

1433
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:20,100
Just think J-Dog sliding around.

1434
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,460
OK.

1435
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,340
So that song, that beat?

1436
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:27,140
Here we go, here's the next one.

1437
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:27,660
Paranoia?

1438
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:29,620
Yeah, there you go.

1439
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,420
I'm not sure if you guessed that last time.

1440
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:32,620
Two more, here we go.

1441
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:35,460
These are harder ones.

1442
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,940
I think this is harder.

1443
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:40,940
I believe in miracles!

1444
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:44,940
Oh, great quiz.

1445
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:48,940
You gotta really know your mixes to get this one, so

1446
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:52,940
thanks to everything you got, okay? Here we go.

1447
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:56,940
Sky high?

1448
01:40:56,940 --> 01:41:00,940
Yes.

1449
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:04,940
Sky high?

1450
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:08,940
Sky High?

1451
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:16,940
You know what's sad is the AM3P remix is actually probably better than the 303 bass mix on the Konomics there.

1452
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,940
That's pretty bad.

1453
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:24,940
That's all I got. What do you think was better, the AM3P remix on Konomics or the Game Boy version?

1454
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,940
I can't tell.

1455
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,940
Guess what, they were the same.

1456
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:34,940
And if you want to find those, they're actually, I believe, the Aaron in Japan site.

1457
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:37,940
Yes, those are ruthlessly stolen from Aaron in Japan's site.

1458
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:42,940
But they're actually labeled as, he's got, at aaroninjapan.com, he has this thing.

1459
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:46,940
It's called DDR Man, which is like a hack for Mega Man 2, which is pretty cool.

1460
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,940
And you can check that out.

1461
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,940
And he calls that the soundtrack.

1462
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:50,940
Really?

1463
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,940
Because those are all ripped from the Game Boy games.

1464
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,940
So, I don't think it says there that they're ripped from the Game Boy games.

1465
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:56,940
I'm not sure if he's aware that's where they came from.

1466
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:05,940
If you're looking to actually play the horrible Game Boy versions, you can find the ROMs on bemoningstyle.com, also they have the links there.

1467
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,940
Now piracy is bad, young man.

1468
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:13,940
Only if you own the cartridge, and you have to delete it 24 hours after you, if you don't have it.

1469
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,940
That's such crap.

1470
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:23,940
I really need to go delete about 500-some ROMs that I've got on my computer right now, because it's been 24 hours.

1471
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:30,940
And then one minute to the next minute you re-download them and then delete them in the next 24 hours.

1472
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:46,940
I know, I know, I know, I know, I just wiped my hard drive, I need to go start...

1473
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:53,940
Hey, I also only have 56k, I'm sorry, we're not in the Bay Area where everybody's fiber-optic.

1474
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,700
This is turning into a penis-sized competition.

1475
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:59,260
This is a guy from Florida says, I got 600 Game Boy ROMs.

1476
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,940
I got 600 Super Nintendo ROMs.

1477
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,260
I got 1,400 NES ROMs.

1478
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,620
I got 400 Genesis ROMs.

1479
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:04,940
So, uh.

1480
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:07,980
And you know what you can do with those?

1481
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:08,860
I don't need to say.

1482
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,860
You know what I'm saying.

1483
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,060
Play them.

1484
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,660
You can play them over and over.

1485
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:13,300
That's right.

1486
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,140
He's been too busy downloading the ROMs.

1487
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:17,780
He's like, I don't have time for girls.

1488
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:19,100
I don't have time for anything.

1489
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:20,980
Give me my ROMs.

1490
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,480
Hey.

1491
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,140
Oh, I think he yelled that in a minute.

1492
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:23,820
What?

1493
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:27,460
Why is SoCalCake saying I don't have a life?

1494
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:28,140
Because he's mean.

1495
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:30,820
Yeah, it's just because I download stuff at work

1496
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:32,820
instead of actually do work, you know,

1497
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:37,340
because I have a T1 line there doesn't mean anything.

1498
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,940
I'm just good at multitasking.

1499
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:46,940
You're not a slut, you're a time saver.

1500
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,940
Let's see, what other topics do I want to talk about?

1501
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,260
Oh, I don't want to talk about tonight.

1502
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:56,020
Matt, since you're kind of our unofficial, official co-host tonight, you've built your

1503
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:58,320
own metal pads for DDR, correct?

1504
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,980
Yes, that doesn't really help my argument that I have a life outside of DDR.

1505
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:05,940
Well, so I'm great that we can go from that topic to this topic.

1506
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,540
Tell us about what a pain in the ass it is to build your own pads.

1507
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:12,920
Oh, it's a very big pain in the ass, especially if you don't know how to solder like I do.

1508
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:18,060
So my pads actually are really, really, really ghetto.

1509
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:21,980
They have, all their connections are actually all electrical tape.

1510
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,260
It's really crap.

1511
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:29,020
But it works from now and then, it only comes apart if I throw it in the back of my car

1512
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,540
and drive around with it.

1513
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,340
But they're pretty cool.

1514
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:38,180
It's basically based off the DDR at home pads, and I believe there's a huge thread in DDR

1515
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,300
Freak with directions on those.

1516
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:44,020
I was about to say, where did you get the schematics on how to build your metal pads?

1517
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:50,540
Well, a long time ago when the melting pot was online, we used to get them there, but

1518
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:56,540
actually there's a huge link to about a 98 page thread that's on DDR Freak under the

1519
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,540
DDR at Home.

1520
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,540
It's pinned to the top.

1521
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:03,900
You can find all the links there, and what I did a little bit differently than what they

1522
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:09,100
had on there is instead of taking actual PlayStation controllers and wiring them to that, I ripped

1523
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:14,580
I used to part my two old home pads at Softpads and wired them to that because they're a hell

1524
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:18,660
lot easier to wire to because it's just a big, huge, flat metal thing you have to solder

1525
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:24,380
to instead of drilling the hole in the controller and getting the solder on there perfectly.

1526
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,380
I tried it the other way and it was really hard.

1527
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:31,460
Then for the arrows, I just took the same pad and chopped up the arrows and put them

1528
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:34,900
under plexiglass and it looked cool.

1529
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:38,180
What are some other home pads you'd recommend commercially out there on the market?

1530
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:42,620
there's a lot of third-party pads and pads out there other than the official

1531
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:47,020
Konami pads is there anything out there that you you'd endorse well I've played

1532
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:51,000
the because I was looking at software etc today and they have these mad cats

1533
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,180
pads and they look so stupid like you so I don't know how well they play but they

1534
01:45:55,180 --> 01:46:00,500
look awful they look like cheap 50s come on everybody let's square dance type pad

1535
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:04,240
when it comes down the soft pads are pretty much all the same as far as the

1536
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:07,960
insides go I mean really the only difference between the Konami official

1537
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:12,820
soft pads and the third-party ones is they've got these like really thin

1538
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:17,980
almost like tape like ribbon tape or something like that inside them they're

1539
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:22,180
actual you know what the electricity goes through and you'll basically have a

1540
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:25,820
thin piece of foam that's in there with holes in it and then when you step down

1541
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,840
on that piece of foam it makes a connection between the two layers of

1542
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:33,740
like I won't call it tape. The difference between the third-party ones is the

1543
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:37,740
third-party ones have almost like it looks like almost like a barcode going

1544
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:43,180
across. They've got just small, thin layers going across, whereas the Konami official

1545
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:48,420
ones have just the whole solid layer, so you probably get better connections with the Konami

1546
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:54,020
official ones. Also, on the top of some of the Konami ones, they're textured differently,

1547
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:55,340
which doesn't really do anything.

1548
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:59,460
Have you ever seen the Dreamcast ones that have that funny little layer over the top,

1549
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,300
that like this weird kind of, it looks like tracing paper or something over the top of

1550
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,420
the pad? It looks very odd. It's very cool, though. I don't know if you've ever seen them.

1551
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,420
Very interesting stuff.

1552
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:13,740
Now, taking a step up from the softpads, you've got the ignition pads, which I've played these

1553
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:19,820
at Fanime, you know, this year, and everyone says they're really cool. I hate the things.

1554
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:21,300
I think they fucking suck.

1555
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,980
Now, wait, I think we've got to, you're talking about the ignition pads?

1556
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,980
Yes.

1557
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,660
I think we've got to counter-argument here, because Glenn here, Lolo, who I haven't introduced

1558
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:32,300
yet, he's in the studio, he actually has an ignition pad, and what do you think?

1559
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:38,900
I have one of the new ones, the Ignition 2.0s, and that's how I passed my first Cata. So,

1560
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,860
I can pass Dynamite Raid at home on that.

1561
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:46,480
Okay, well, you know, in my defense, I played Ignition 1, Pat, so.

1562
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,480
Yeah.

1563
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,700
Obviously, they've probably gotten better. The problem I had with the last one is, even

1564
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,980
though they did have raise buttons, which was nice, the problem was is they're raised

1565
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:59,340
so much. When you're playing on them, it just feels weird, and it actually, you know, really

1566
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:04,540
hurt my ankles after just playing about one song. And they were pretty responsive, but

1567
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:08,180
it was just, it hurt the hell out of my ankles so I couldn't play anymore.

1568
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:13,460
It's still not as good as the arcade, but I could pass a cata at home. I mean, that's

1569
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:19,760
all I have to say. I could pass a cata at home. And you can't do that on a Konami official

1570
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,780
pad without being halfway across the room when you're done, you know?

1571
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:28,260
Okay. Then, let's see. Now, step up from those pads, you've also got the metal pads that

1572
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:35,340
out there now. There's the Kevin K. pads, which Kevin K. has been really getting reamed

1573
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:40,760
over because they suck. He has horrible wiring on them. Then there's also the new six panel

1574
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,960
metal pads out there. They'll run about, I believe, 200 bucks a piece that you can actually

1575
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,640
find online. There's tons of links in the DDR Freak at Home forum. They look alright.

1576
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:55,080
I haven't gotten to play on any of them. But, you know, if you really want to go the same

1577
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:59,400
route like I did and build one, it cost me about $200 a pad.

1578
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,440
That also includes that I had to buy the tools to do it because I didn't have a saw or drill

1579
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,240
or anything like that, so I bought one of those.

1580
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:13,240
So it really probably ended up being about $150 per pad.

1581
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:17,040
You think it's a profitable business to be making your own metal pads and selling them

1582
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,600
over eBay like some of these people are doing?

1583
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,600
Nope.

1584
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,600
Not at all.

1585
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:27,600
After the cost of building them, which is roughly about $150 per pad,

1586
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,600
let's just say you're building the same one I had,

1587
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:35,600
and then you have to charge a little bit more to get some profit off of it plus shipping,

1588
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:41,600
you're only going to be making about $10 a pad and it's a good 40 hours worth of work.

1589
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:47,600
It took me 40 hours to build two pads and I built them at the same time.

1590
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:53,840
And plus having to maintain some sort of website or something like that so people can get hold

1591
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,840
of you.

1592
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,600
Plus having to answer people's stupid things like, ah, it's not working anymore, and having

1593
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:00,600
to replace it.

1594
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,600
It's just, it's not worth it.

1595
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:09,320
There's a guy that tried doing it a while back, Beat Gear, which were like $400 for

1596
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,880
these pads and stuff.

1597
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,200
And I don't even know if anyone's actually gotten those yet.

1598
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:18,040
I think maybe a few people that have gotten them, but that was like almost a year ago

1599
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,040
I think.

1600
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:24,160
It's just taken forever, so I wouldn't recommend, you know, actually starting a business that

1601
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,160
way.

1602
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,120
Just make your own and be done with it.

1603
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,120
Seriously.

1604
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:33,560
But the next thing I want to build is Dance Maniacs sensors, which would be beautiful.

1605
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,280
What would you play with, though?

1606
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,520
There's no Dance Maniacs home version.

1607
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,520
What would you do?

1608
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:44,520
There is a nice skin and all the step files for that old Delight Delight reduclication.

1609
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:45,520
Oh, an emulator.

1610
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,520
An emulator.

1611
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,520
Alright, cool.

1612
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,520
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back and wrap up the

1613
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,520
show.

1614
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,960
So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio and as would be fitting, I'm going to play

1615
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:56,960
a request.

1616
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,180
Somebody wanted to hear some more Orange Lounge, the artist.

1617
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:06,180
So here you go.

1618
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,180
Oh

1619
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:03,180
Yeah, I'm just feeling love

1620
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:06,180
I need some new love

1621
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,180
Ooh, yeah

1622
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,180
I need some new love

1623
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,180
No, no

1624
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,180
I need some new love

1625
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,180
Okay, okay

1626
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:17,180
I need some new love

1627
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,180
Ooh, yeah

1628
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:22,180
Do you believe in love?

1629
01:55:52,180 --> 01:56:17,900
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

1630
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:29,900
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time at under sedationlive.org.

1631
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:55,900
Orange Lounge! This GDR sucks! Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

1632
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:56,900
Yes!

1633
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,900
GGPO!

1634
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:06,300
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're coming back to pretty much just about

1635
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:12,540
wrap up the show here. Not a whole lot else to say. Well there was one quick thing I did

1636
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,340
want to say. Oh yes, so it's Jamie's out of the state tonight. She's off in Nevada in

1637
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,960
I thought, does anybody have any interesting playing DDR out of the state stories they

1638
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:22,960
want to share?

1639
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:23,960
Like not playing California?

1640
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:27,860
Because California, if you ever looked at where all the machines are located throughout

1641
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:34,160
the nation, California is by far the biggest, you know, most well populated with DDR.

1642
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:36,400
Any funny stories about playing DDR out of state?

1643
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,320
Do you have anything, Melody or Matt?

1644
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,320
Yes.

1645
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:46,080
It's not particularly funny, but back when I was playing at, oh, trick level, I happened

1646
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:51,020
to go to Reno and was playing on a USA for the simple fact that's all they had.

1647
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:55,180
The Nugget, I think it was, and I scared the hell out of the locals.

1648
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:59,220
I guess they thought they could only do basic, and here I come in and I have, like, La Señorita

1649
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:03,580
trick, and I nearly fall in love with the thing, and they're just like, oh my god, look

1650
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:06,940
at her, and then I go to dub-by-dub advance, they're just like, oh my god, look what she's

1651
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:07,940
doing!

1652
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:12,940
I'm just like, it's not that great, come on, people.

1653
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:14,260
That's about the only experience I have.

1654
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:19,220
I'm waiting till I go back to the midwest to really scare the crap out of them right on and I hear there's some pretty

1655
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:22,780
Good arcades in the midwest though if you can find them. Yeah, if you can find them, uh

1656
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:25,660
You have anything to share Matt?

1657
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:31,660
Well, my first game of DDR was in Lake Tahoe. My first game was in Vegas. Yeah, and

1658
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:39,860
That was pretty bad. But anyways, um while back I went down actually it was during my birthday. I believe last year

1659
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,660
I went to

1660
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:48,220
Lake Tahoe and Reno to, um, you know, go gamble because I was 21, and, um, so, I went there

1661
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:53,700
and I got to play, um, a third Korean that was in Circus Circus, and that really sucked

1662
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:57,800
because they had the stage pushed right up to the machine, so it was like, playing and

1663
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,700
hugging the, uh, screen at the same time.

1664
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:00,700
I love DDR!

1665
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:05,500
Seriously, it's, it's pretty bad, and I had a bunch of, like, drunk old people staring

1666
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,580
at me, like, what the hell is he doing?

1667
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,500
Why is he stepping on that machine?

1668
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,500
What's he doing?

1669
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:20,500
Well, I hope Jamie's having fun out there in Vegas and I'm sure Melody wishes that Mel B's having a good time too, yes?

1670
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,500
Just not too good of a time.

1671
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:30,500
Just not too good of a time, you know. As long as she's staying in the Vegas city limits and not going to any houses outside of town, everything's good.

1672
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,500
That's the end of the show folks.

1673
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:40,500
And remember, any bribes for wanting to play Solo 2K can be PMed to SharksGirlSHARXGRRL.

1674
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:46,500
Nice little plug there. Good night, Melody. Anything else you want to add? Thank you for being our very special guest tonight. We appreciate it.

1675
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:48,500
Thank you for paying attention to me. I've been lonely.

1676
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:54,500
Well, I'm glad you were a little more participating in the show because you didn't have a migraine or anything like that.

1677
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:58,500
It's amazing how much more lively and human you are when you're not in agonizing pain.

1678
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:03,140
Well, I'm glad we get to see this side of Melody, and Dark Tetsuya, goodnight to you.

1679
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:05,080
Any final parting words here?

1680
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:09,220
Nah, word, sharks, girl, I know that.

1681
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:10,220
Anything else you want to say?

1682
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:11,220
Goodbye to the folks out there.

1683
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,220
All your fans out there.

1684
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:13,220
Yeah.

1685
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:14,220
You got some fans in the chat room.

1686
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:15,220
Really?

1687
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,220
Yeah.

1688
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:17,220
Sayonara.

1689
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:18,220
Sayonara it is.

1690
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,220
Bradley, anything?

1691
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:20,220
Any final comments?

1692
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,220
Not really.

1693
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:22,220
All right.

1694
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:23,220
Brad and Irene are out in the...

1695
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,220
Oh, bye.

1696
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:27,660
Okay, Brad and Irene are out in the back getting cancer, so on behalf of them, I say goodnight,

1697
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:30,440
And anything last from you, Matt? The co-host for this evening.

1698
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:37,840
Yes, after today I'll have to revert back down to guest instead of co-host. I'd be willing

1699
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,880
to step down, yes, as of next week.

1700
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:43,440
You'll be willing to step down. Next week is going to be a special show. Definitely

1701
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:48,180
tune in to next week's show. It's not going to be live, but it'll be pre-taped like a

1702
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:52,400
live show. It'll be interesting. Experimental show for you Labor Day people.

1703
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:55,680
I'll make another painful edit to commemorate the show.

1704
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:58,640
Yeah, sounds fun.

1705
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,840
On behalf of everybody else, thanks for listening, you guys.

1706
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,080
We'll see you next week.

1707
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,800
And if you missed any part of the show,

1708
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,920
we'll be doing a Monday night replay tomorrow night

1709
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,080
from 7 PM until 1 o'clock in the morning.

1710
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:12,800
A special three show rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio.

1711
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,560
See you guys.

1712
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1713
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,800
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1714
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:25,400
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also

1715
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:29,880
known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1716
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:33,640
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1717
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,120
I run with gays.

1718
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:36,120
Oh, yeah?

1719
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:39,120
I run with 12 gangs, and we only commit hate crimes.

1720
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:41,120
Whatever, I'll do what I want.

1721
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,120
Whatever.

1722
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,120
You ain't bad.

1723
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:44,120
You ain't nothing.

1724
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:47,120
I ditch class and go shoot heroin in a school bathroom.

1725
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,120
Whatever.

1726
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,120
I ran for Congress and won.

1727
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:53,120
Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hit her body.

1728
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,120
Whatever.

1729
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:55,120
I'll do what I want.

1730
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:58,120
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
