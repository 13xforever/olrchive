30607	32608	Isn't this 4215, pussywaves?
33028	33729	You bitch!
33789	35750	Now let me check the zip code.
35770	36790	212, fuck you!
36810	38451	You have no morals, darling.
38571	43433	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of curtains.
43453	45794	Kiss my grip, noob.
45814	48136	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.
48256	50337	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
50577	51717	Me too!
51977	52458	Fucker, yeah?
52658	53618	I'm working on it.
54359	54779	Loser.
54939	55499	Lame!
55839	57360	I'm the size of my face.
58382	62846	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
63246	68951	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
69392	72114	I am your singing telegram.
75038	83022	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
83443	87765	You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.
88205	90466	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
90806	96129	Typically I would be saying, joining me as always is my lovely co-host Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
96569	99111	However, she's out tonight in Vegas.
99946	100507	I see ice cream.
125448	126129	You want ice cream?
126669	127829	They're ice cream candy.
127849	128950	It's ice cream time!
128970	130070	Yes, they're ice cream.
130250	131851	It's ice cream time!
131931	133911	Now you know what ice cream time probably sounds like.
133991	134311	Alright.
136492	140254	Of course, we're also, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends.
140274	142694	Say hello to Joe, also known as DarkTetsuya.
142714	143095	Hey.
143475	145615	And we got Irene, the Rice Princess.
146236	148056	Is there alcohol in Vanilla Coke?
148236	148777	There might be.
149517	150517	In that one, perhaps.
150837	152358	And we've also got Bradley.
154122	159722	and Brad I don't say anything, I don't like you anyway
160683	164865	This is episode number 10 for August 25th of 2002.
165366	168888	We'll be talking to all our guests a little more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
169748	174130	And in this break, we're going to have all a bunch of Euromix 2 stuff.
174731	176712	Ooh, dear God, no.
176752	177272	But we have to start.
177292	178553	Here we go.
178593	183336	Starting off, we're going to have Vanity Angel with Fix here on Orange Lounge Radio.
207674	209195	Can you hear the cheering?
209255	209995	Super performance!
251972	252834	Thanks for watching!
282378	284840	Your dance showed us a dream for the future.
285321	286622	Tomorrow is another day.
287143	289325	You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.
318234	321038	I am sure of what I want, tell me what you want
374093	375894	Thank you for watching!
470079	476822	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
477162	482065	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
482765	488868	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
489208	491089	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
491669	496031	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
496559	498801	Well, thank you, Mel, for letting us know that one.
499381	500802	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
500842	503564	In that set, we had all Euromix 2 stuff.
504024	506086	Starting it off, Vanity Angel with Fix.
506346	509188	And in the middle there, Love You Like a Fool by Jessica Folker.
509448	510849	Kind of sounds a little bit like Divas.
510869	512310	A little bit of that R&B stuff.
512590	512911	Yeah.
513051	514091	What the Folker was that?
514552	514952	Huh, Brent?
518655	522317	And, of course, if you didn't know that one, probably one of the most well-known songs on there.
522437	524519	At least I know that one very well.
524799	526020	Rednecks with Cotton Eye Joe.
527476	529738	They're either rednecks, but they spell it the leet way.
529778	534562	They spell it a rednecks with an X. Like, oh yeah, they're out to get you.
536163	543469	So I have to ask Melody if Melody can get on the mic here, because Melody gets asked this question all the time.
543509	544289	We just played the promo.
544309	544950	Where is Mel B.?
546147	547488	Mel's not here.
549349	551351	I swear I'm getting a shirt that says that.
551371	552472	Mel's not here.
552632	554513	No, but Mel's in the same place where Jamie's at.
554533	555634	They're all in Vegas together.
556175	557696	I don't think it's any secret.
557736	562740	There's a little moderator's convention going on in Vegas for DDR freaks.
562760	563961	So that's where they're all at right now.
564161	565602	Drinking the night away.
566082	568063	Every mod asks me, are you going along too?
568164	568884	Are you going along too?
568964	569805	No, I'm not a mod.
569845	570445	I can't go.
570645	571286	I'm poor.
571726	575489	Unless anyone wanted to sponsor me for a trip to Vegas, it just wasn't happening.
575809	577350	I'm sure Jamie's having tons of fun down there.
577410	583414	She was going to be recording some interviews for us, hopefully, because there's a lot of well-known people in the community that are going to be there.
583874	588337	Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get the tape player to take down there and tape some stuff.
588377	589698	So, we're shit out of luck.
589758	592080	But hey, that just means we're just going to have to go around...
592680	595682	throughout the community and get the interviews, you know, at other times.
596002	606029	And hopefully we get a drunken voicemail because for the Saturday night program that I do under SedationLive.org, they're supposed to be leaving a drunken voicemail for that show.
606129	609952	So I'm pretty sure I'd be able to use that drunken voicemail on this show if we can get it.
610052	610652	So we'll see.
610772	611092	We'll see.
611372	611953	Who knows?
613924	621912	Alright, I was just given a link to read some results for a tournament that happened yesterday at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco.
622292	623093	I haven't been there yet.
623133	624114	I hear it's really cool though.
624154	626836	It's like a golf land in San Francisco is what they're calling it.
626856	630279	Because they got, I believe, Dance Maniacs as well?
630860	631661	Kind of a question mark.
631681	636245	But I know they also have a Beatmania 3 7th, which is not a very commonly seen machine.
636946	646149	So the results of that contest were first place was Uncle Fuzz of .half, and second place was the Asian Harry Potter of .half.
647209	648309	The Asian Harry Potter.
648649	650730	I know a guy that looks like an Asian Harry Potter.
650790	652450	It's not this guy, but that's funny.
653391	656752	And then third place was Black Lab of Team P.O.P.
657292	661093	I keep wanting to say poop when I see that, except there's only one O, so it's Team Pop.
661933	680658	and fourth place was Seahop of Team and it's got all this leet speak it's GE basically so congratulations to all those people I noticed the real names of the third and fourth place winners both Ryan so if your name's Ryan you must be pretty good at Perfect Attack this is only a Perfect Attack tournament no freestyle it was just a mini tournament so congratulations to
681741	684062	All those of you that placed or participated in that tournament.
684083	684903	Sounds like a fun time.
685163	685904	I should have gone out there.
685924	690506	I think I vaguely heard about it, but I didn't know it was this soon.
690526	691547	I thought it was a ways away.
691667	692347	Whoops, my bad.
693228	695369	Anyway, oh, I'm being yelled at in the chat room, Team Pop.
698451	701733	I have to say hi to Tal because he'll beat me up if I don't.
701813	702274	So there you go.
702294	703094	Why aren't you here?
703434	704235	That's my question.
704435	706116	Ah, you didn't get to whore the mic.
706356	707757	Yeah, you didn't get to whore the mic tonight.
708798	711199	And thanks to Black Lab for giving me that link.
711239	713421	And he wants everybody to know that he beat Tigger.
713661	714361	So there you go.
717664	718024	No, no, no.
718264	718664	No, no, no.
719765	721266	Tigger is somebody's online name.
721326	724148	It's not like a euphemism for your private parts like it is for your bread.
728496	729358	Bounce, bounce, what?
732926	738658	Bap, bap, tigger, hey, tigger Okay, that was, yeah
739886	741507	Hey Rob, how about the weather?
741768	742468	Yeah, how about it?
742528	742908	It's great.
742948	744830	Let's take care of some housekeeping.
745290	746230	Fuck you.
746871	747831	No, thank you.
749492	751874	I have to make a correction to last week.
751954	755837	We debuted on the show some new 8th style MP3s.
756337	757438	You might have heard this one.
757498	759079	We played M for you.
759099	761900	Crap!
761940	762561	Crap!
763379	764820	Well, you know what?
765440	766361	They're fake anyway.
766421	767921	That's what we just found out during the week.
768062	772604	It's not confirmed that they're fake, but let's just say it's not confirmed that they're real either.
773084	775886	We actually took a really good listen to them outside.
775946	782669	Now, obviously, to suit all you modem users who are listening to this show, we have to downcode the show a lot, so you can't really hear the instruments as clear as we can.
783109	787712	We really listened to that, and it doesn't quite sound like it came off a Beatmania machine.
788504	795072	Possibility it still could be a song, but the Magic 8-Ball says all signs point to no.
795392	799878	Doesn't DJ Taka have his own website, or was that Taka?
799958	801259	Taka has his own website.
801279	802481	I don't believe Taka does.
803762	805525	It sounds like a freaking pushpin anyway.
806946	807586	It doesn't matter.
807646	808967	That song sucks ass.
808987	809967	I hope it's not real.
809987	816109	I hope no actual artist that would be featured on any Bimani would make that piece of shit.
816489	816949	We'll see.
817069	817450	Who knows?
818010	819670	Then again, there's Crash.
820250	823111	Yeah, as long as Crash exists, who knows?
823151	823732	Breakdown!
826112	826793	What else do we want to say?
826873	827813	Oh, next week's show.
828433	832134	And I haven't told anybody in here the plan for next week's show, but I did talk about it with Jamie.
833075	833795	Next week's show...
835302	836443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
862193	864294	Patron harassing will be encouraged
883044	883904	We'll see you next time.
910636	912657	And I don't care one bit.
912897	915938	Any other plans for what you guys want to do on Wednesday over at Golf One?
916378	918619	I'll be bringing, yes, I'm very obsessed.
918739	924201	I'll be bringing my mobile editing computer with me for edits.
924361	925522	You're going to kill people with your edits.
925662	929403	I finished, by the way, tell people, you know, this is a national show.
929423	930724	We've got people all over the U.S.
930744	931424	who are participating.
931464	933305	So not everybody's going to be able to participate in this.
933345	937286	But maybe for some of the Bay Area local people, tell everybody about your edit contest coming up.
937466	938947	Okay, well I have an edit contest.
939287	941489	Normally, I've been posting on the Sakamani boards.
942149	944230	Basically, the edits fall in two categories.
944250	948613	You have freestyle, and then you have hell edits, or really fucking hard edits.
949434	954857	And, because I work at a video distribution company, normally prizes are a whole bunch of DVDs.
955438	957559	And I can say this much, that...
958199	959620	I won the last edit contest.
959660	960500	I won the freestyle portion.
960700	963581	I literally must have gotten hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs.
963701	964641	So much stuff.
965142	965522	Insane.
965822	966102	Cool.
966202	968483	And like screeners of stuff that wasn't even released yet.
968963	971044	I saw American Psycho 2 before any of you.
972424	973005	No, I didn't watch it.
973105	974845	It didn't look good.
975125	975665	But I have it.
975685	976966	Yeah, it really sucks.
976986	977466	And you don't.
977986	980147	But tons of anime DVDs for sure.
980667	984709	I know that first place is going to get Lord of the Rings and both Austin Powers movies.
986350	987371	That's for sure.
987751	989853	And then I just have both.
989893	990694	Just a bunch of crap.
990734	991554	It's worth a second.
991855	994577	It takes, what, a half hour to make a decent edit, maybe?
995038	995398	Yeah.
995598	996939	Just nothing to enter.
997180	998341	It's totally free to enter.
998361	999562	You just have to be there.
1000583	1006808	At some point, I was trying to do it where I could have people submit edits online to me, but that got to be too confusing.
1006868	1007529	No, that's not fair.
1007549	1008069	They've got to be there.
1008089	1008870	They've got to be there in person.
1008890	1010692	You have to be down at Sunsplash in order to enter.
1011413	1012574	and yeah, that's about it.
1013035	1013355	Cool.
1013876	1015178	I want to give you a free plug for that.
1015278	1022367	Well, this time around, hopefully, since I've got that nice little laptop and hopefully everything works, I haven't gotten them set up yet, I'll be able to copy that.
1022407	1026393	It's from people's cards and actually be able to post them on the internet when I'm done.
1026593	1032516	Well, I finished my hell edit today, so those that saw it, don't say anything about it, but it's going to be good, I think.
1032716	1036218	I hate to stroke my own ego here, but I think you'll like it.
1036558	1044062	Also, speaking of edits, my edits are now on the SoCalKicks website, www.socalkicks.com.
1044722	1047743	And actually, maybe we can get the winners of the contest, get all those edits.
1047783	1052906	Maybe if we kiss enough ass with SoCalKicks, he'll put all those edits up for us.
1053066	1053386	Who knows?
1053686	1054046	I'm sure.
1055507	1057008	I'll be sending them some more at some point.
1057568	1057908	Sounds good.
1060269	1061009	Don't play the stuff that sucks!
1089838	1093482	Basically, we already voted the worst Vimani song in history on this program.
1093502	1095224	Next to Let Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
1095585	1098548	You will never, ever hear that song on our playlist.
1098588	1100090	So, we're only playing the good stuff.
1101122	1109686	If you have any requests, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com I've been getting a few new remixes here and there, some mixed things.
1110306	1112347	I might play one of those later in the show.
1112387	1114788	Towards the end of the show, I got one during the week.
1114848	1115709	It's very interesting.
1115749	1118690	It's a hybrid of two songs that you wouldn't imagine together.
1118790	1121011	So we might play that towards the end of the show if we've got some time.
1121451	1130419	If you have any fan remixes, go ahead and email me about sending those to me at OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and Jamie and I will look them over and maybe we'll go ahead and put them in our playlist.
1130699	1134402	But I ask that they be, you know, kind of remixed a lot.
1134522	1139026	Like, don't just, you know, re-loop the song in a sound editor, take clips.
1139066	1147253	I'm adding, like, you know, put some new instruments in there, take some vocals, do new things with it, kind of remix it a little more than just, you know, a five-second remixing job.
1148414	1148514	Uh...
1150310	1151090	What else did I want to say?
1151130	1153651	There was something... I don't know.
1153791	1154031	Anyway.
1155132	1156032	I don't make notes.
1156292	1156952	Where are my notes?
1157192	1157973	I do have some notes.
1158053	1158373	Let's see.
1160093	1164175	Did I say... I wanted to say something else about... Something they could email me about.
1164495	1165815	What are they paying you for, Rob?
1166335	1167336	I don't get paid for this.
1167496	1168176	Isn't that crazy?
1168656	1169576	I don't get paid for this.
1169596	1170437	Isn't that a travesty?
1170457	1171017	Where's my money?
1172990	1176352	There was something else that I was going to say they could email me about.
1176933	1177393	Ice cream?
1177854	1178434	Requests.
1178474	1179735	You can always email your requests.
1179775	1187000	If there's a song that you're not hearing in the Bomani Musical More program or on this show, you can always email us your requests and we'll get those to you as well.
1187320	1187681	I'll think of it.
1187701	1188381	It'll come to me later.
1188401	1191383	Could it be songs that you'd like to hear in Bomani Musical More?
1191403	1191563	Right.
1191604	1192004	Requests.
1192144	1192324	Yes.
1193005	1193345	Requests.
1194085	1194386	I don't know.
1194526	1194746	Oh well.
1195891	1197292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1224716	1225277	Matt's F.U.
1225297	1226178	music is much better.
1226698	1227098	No, no, no.
1227139	1228240	Matt's F.U.
1228260	1228960	music is much better.
1228980	1229621	You'll like this.
1230502	1231263	You'll like this, Brad.
1233925	1235247	Okay, now you can do your F.U.
1235307	1236328	of the week.
1236788	1238950	I hate this fucking music!
1239291	1239611	See?
1239931	1240192	See?
1242354	1243235	It makes him angry!
1244660	1251267	Anyways, my FQ of the week has to go to Kaiser for renting out RVGL for the last three days.
1252208	1252888	What the hell?
1253089	1256932	I mean, I've seen company parties last, you know, a day or something, but why three days?
1257093	1260516	I mean, it seems a little... I can tell you why.
1260576	1261737	I used to work for Kaiser.
1261777	1264380	Their ass holes.
1265381	1265821	Fuck you!
1267378	1268500	Yeah, well, they're not assholes.
1268540	1268960	I don't know.
1269141	1270222	I don't know anybody personally there.
1270262	1272946	But, you know, they're rich enough because they're doctors and shit.
1272966	1276370	You know, that's why they can... The only reason why they do it is because they can afford to.
1276390	1276611	Yeah.
1276631	1276851	What?
1280523	1282764	The point is, what do they have to do at RBGL?
1282985	1285186	I mean, they're not playing DDR, are they?
1285206	1296033	You know, I'm imagining some physician, like, trying DDR or Drum Mania or something, and he's like, whoa, rock out, yeah, you know, like, reliving his youth because he's bald and, you know.
1296313	1297574	I broke my fibula.
1299035	1299716	Exactly.
1300256	1302557	Maybe they're doing research or something, I don't know.
1304979	1305880	For three days.
1306220	1309162	Or maybe they're just too stupid and, you know, just...
1309915	1313378	I don't know when I want to go down and party, so we're just going to leave the weekend open.
1313939	1314619	Leave it open.
1314659	1318262	Well, I can say that also the folks that work at Kaiser work some pretty effed up schedules.
1318282	1320905	Like, I have a friend that works there who's working at 11.30 tonight.
1321325	1326069	So imagine, you know, if they were only doing it for one day and you had to work, you know, that would kind of suck.
1326690	1327931	So two days, but three days.
1328431	1334457	And on the weekend, not only any weekend, but the weekend before school starts for most people, if it hasn't started already, it's kind of...
1335399	1338442	What a bunch of bitches.
1338482	1339903	My mom actually works for Kaiser.
1340383	1344047	I don't get to see my mom for long stretches of time because I decide to go out in the daytime.
1344367	1349852	That's when she's asleep because she works like 2.30 to 11 at night and then weekends too.
1350052	1353775	So it's like, okay, hi mom, bye mom, see you later, walk by.
1353795	1355457	It can be kind of screwed up.
1355957	1360178	It's kind of like when dogs pee-pee on trees and stuff.
1360198	1361058	They're marking their territory.
1361078	1362419	They're showing their power.
1363319	1365159	That's what Kaiser's doing right now.
1366059	1367200	They're showing their power.
1367300	1369200	They're peeing on our DDR machine?
1369360	1370941	If they do, I'm going to kick their ass.
1370961	1371661	Oh my god.
1371841	1372781	They're going to die.
1372801	1377742	No health insurance can bring them back from the dead that I'll take them to or something like that.
1378822	1379663	Somebody help me, quick.
1380723	1382383	Tell them to do it somewhere else.
1383464	1384684	Yeah, like on the Parapara machine.
1384784	1385044	There we go.
1386110	1388011	Hey, that's what CCL's for, okay?
1388351	1390713	Hey, I play there.
1391433	1396436	You know, one time, I was at Sunnyvale Golf Line, and I think somebody seriously peed behind the 2DX machine.
1397437	1397617	Ew.
1398577	1400718	Yeah, it does smell there.
1401319	1401739	Pretty bad.
1401799	1405381	But, you know, I think that's just because the bathroom's right next to one of the GDR machines.
1405401	1406442	I don't know if it is there anymore, but...
1408194	1414322	But anyways, yeah, what I wanted to say is that sucked because I couldn't go down and play DDR down there all weekend long.
1414402	1418588	I mean, I could understand missing out one day, but I haven't played in like a couple weeks.
1418668	1419809	I'm starting to feel like drolls.
1420911	1423734	Stop that goddamn song!
1424355	1425176	I hate that thing!
1427662	1429303	Kaiser steals your soul.
1430284	1431625	We are Kaiser!
1432906	1433827	Kaiser Wave!
1433987	1435168	You didn't have that mic off, did you?
1435468	1435649	No.
1435829	1437690	Okay, yeah, don't turn it off, because they'll turn them both off.
1437991	1439192	Yeah, I didn't.
1439212	1440733	Just checking, just checking.
1440773	1444496	We got some FUs from the chatroom that would like to be shared with all of you out there.
1444536	1449060	If you want to join our chatroom, you're just going to join any other side IRC server.
1449360	1452863	That's one of the servers in your list, if you have MIRC, that's in your list.
1453543	1460730	One example server you could join would be irc.eggheads.org, and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
1461030	1472239	And that is the same server, by the way, as most of the big Bomani channels, DDR Freak, 2DX Style, DDR Spot, all have their chat rooms over on other side IRC, and we do as well, Orange Lounge.
1472420	1474922	Some FUs from the chat room, SoCalKicks says...
1475442	1496842	Fuck Pepsi Blue because it fucked up the camera that he borrowed from his friend And I guess what he did is there's some kind of, it has a crappy cap on it he says That I guess must have went flying and conked the camera in just the right way That one of the lines, the LED lines, doesn't work And now he's in deep poopy So fuck you Pepsi Blue from SoCalKicks
1498848	1505617	A big fuck you from Black Lab to A Minute Extended Mix because it's the song that he lost to on PA Competition.
1506078	1507580	So, fuck that song.
1508982	1511505	You know, it only takes a minute, girl, for Max 2.
1511726	1511926	Yes.
1515211	1516672	Well, that's what it's called.
1516732	1517773	It's like the extended mix.
1517853	1518233	Whatever.
1518373	1518974	Shut up, Brad.
1519494	1519754	Anyway.
1521095	1522236	Another F you.
1522916	1530141	Idiots who get balloons and suck the helium out and get on the second pad and talk with that weird helium voice when I'm doing a cat-up.
1531763	1533063	That's from Twin316.
1533564	1536066	I myself would find that quite humorous, actually.
1538210	1543953	Catas, it's kind of, you know, DDR, I have to say, it's getting a little repetitive, you know, it's getting a little boring.
1544633	1549016	You know, when the modifiers won't shuffle it up enough, you know, get somebody on there to talk with Helium.
1549036	1550116	They should have that kind of modifier.
1550136	1551277	That's an idea for Wednesday.
1551357	1552037	Write that down.
1556239	1558200	The announcer starts speaking like he has a Helium voice.
1558220	1558600	That's right.
1558620	1563403	That'd be funny, like, you know, some sort of modifiers that get the announcer to make fun of you.
1563563	1564683	God, you fucking suck.
1564703	1565864	Get out the damn pad.
1566496	1568717	Yeah, what are you doing on the stage, you crack whore?
1569458	1571820	Don't even put your money in, you're gonna fail anyway!
1572080	1573240	Before you even get on the machine.
1576102	1585929	That reminds me, um, we borrowed a... I just recently acquired a JPS2 and got a copy of DDR Max that is very scratched up, so...
1586667	1588788	You go and you choose a song, it's already booing you.
1589268	1592709	You haven't even taken one step, and it's already saying, 400 combo!
1592729	1593970	Oh, it's the Roseville-Golfland mix!
1594970	1597131	You don't even take a step and say, 400 combo!
1597171	1600392	Mel had a combo of about 300, and it started booing him out of nowhere.
1600432	1601093	It was great.
1601453	1604354	It was like The Exorcist meets DDR or something.
1605394	1608375	Does it vomit pea soup if you get a certain combo?
1609216	1611397	Maybe out of the memory card slot, I didn't try that.
1612297	1612357	Eww!
1614409	1616431	Maybe for a 666 combo?
1617292	1620035	There was vomit coming out of the slot.
1620235	1620876	Okay, anyways.
1623639	1625160	Yeah, that would be pretty funny.
1625240	1632347	Or even a great prank would be to hook up some sort of, I don't know, a microphone or something to the actual speakers.
1632427	1635851	And just when people are going in to put in money, you start yelling through their remote mic, say...
1637108	1640710	I don't know, from the upper balcony from Sunsplash, you know, to shell them down.
1641030	1641631	You suck!
1641851	1642571	Get off the stage!
1642591	1643352	And they're like, what the hell?
1643372	1644733	Well, we can just do that from the balcony.
1644753	1645513	We don't need a microphone.
1646694	1656239	Yeah, but... No, that brings up an idea, though, that I thought about when they had a for Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania session is to have a microphone slot so you can do karaoke with them while they're playing.
1657500	1661683	Of course, I wouldn't try to sing because I already know I suck, so... But, um, Rob's really good.
1662043	1663304	We should play one of your songs, Rob.
1664764	1665465	No, we shouldn't!
1667834	1672415	I'm, um, SoCalKicks in the chat room is being an attention whore and he's whining that I'm not.
1672715	1674835	I didn't do his second part of his FU of the week.
1674875	1676336	So here's his second part of the FU week.
1676836	1682077	He says, uh, fuck you to Echo for making $58 pants and $38 shirts.
1682457	1684217	He spent $270 there yesterday.
1684577	1686538	Well, if it bothers you, why did you spend $270?
1687338	1688278	That's what I don't get.
1688898	1690839	Go to Walmart and get $14 jeans.
1690979	1692119	Ross, that's what I'm saying, dude.
1692179	1692819	Ross, Target.
1693659	1694839	Oh, I'm styling.
1695240	1697300	I'm representing when I'm wearing my, uh,
1699284	1700524	Kmart has Joe Boxer's now.
1700804	1701525	Sweet.
1702305	1703705	That's how you impress the ladies.
1703925	1704525	Joe Boxer.
1704685	1705065	Trust me.
1705946	1706366	Just look at me.
1707406	1711427	And Tal gives a big F you to Guitar Freaks.
1713287	1714708	Because it's been broken for a few weeks.
1719509	1720689	I think we've got all the F yous.
1722848	1723468	I have an F.U.
1723648	1725089	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
1725249	1727129	Since you're a special guest, you get a song.
1727530	1728410	You get a song, too.
1728450	1729310	I have to find a song.
1729930	1730350	No, no, no.
1730390	1731571	We've already done Petite Love for Somebody.
1731591	1731931	Let's see.
1733211	1733471	Let's see.
1733491	1734092	What can I think?
1736712	1737573	Okay, you know what?
1737813	1738473	You know what I'll give you?
1741034	1742054	I'm going to give you Like a Virgin.
1743114	1744075	You are such a liar.
1746295	1747816	Anyone who knows me knows this is a trick.
1749629	1754857	Anyway, my FU of the week is to Santana Row in San Jose.
1755178	1759124	Anyone who's in the Bay Area knows Santana Row is this gigantic complex.
1760466	1763651	It's going to be housing and shopping and all this shit.
1764614	1765835	It burned down.
1766395	1774121	You get to see this giant Santana Row opening September 19th with it in major flames in the background.
1774141	1777203	We're talking 11 alarms, biggest fire in San Jose's history.
1777723	1779284	Now the reason why this is an FU of the week?
1779685	1782707	Because I found out they were going to be charging for these condos.
1782747	1784868	Okay, they have condos in there?
1785389	1786109	$15,000 a month.
1786509	1790292	Who has that kind of money for a freaking condo every month?
1790922	1791562	So, you know what?
1791662	1792983	I don't feel bad for them anymore.
1793003	1798364	Because if they can find that kind of money to be charging for a condo, they damn it, they deserve it to be burned down.
1799445	1800425	Preach on, sister.
1801645	1803626	What, they have like golden toilets in there or something?
1803646	1805106	What the hell?
1810529	1815073	I think we're going to go to a quick break and we'll come back and talk about some more things.
1815093	1821098	We're going to talk about USA's going bye-bye, being replaced with some new machines locally.
1821539	1823681	We'll talk about that coming back from break.
1824061	1825842	I'm going to do a request this break.
1825863	1829145	This is a request I said I'd do last week and I didn't, so my bad.
1830687	1832148	I'll do it this week, tonight.
1832668	1834370	One other thing I did want to say before we go to break.
1835190	1836491	Thanks for watching!
1853769	1854790	I just don't know what day.
1855250	1856491	Maybe Sunday, maybe not.
1857192	1858333	You're kicking something there, sweetie.
1858593	1858793	Are you?
1859114	1859374	Oh, no?
1859514	1859854	Oh, okay.
1860435	1864778	I was just making sure that wasn't the router because then the show would have just gone bye-bye.
1865138	1870102	Anyway, yeah, I will be out doing some interviews at some of the Bay Area golf lands.
1870143	1873325	I just don't know where and I don't know when just yet, but it will be sometime next weekend.
1873906	1877729	I'll post an announcement somewhere appropriate when I know more about where I'm going to be.
1878229	1881212	And if I run into you, I just might interview you for this program.
1882213	1882933	Thank you for watching!
1907062	1925628	Dreamer, dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please, boy, you're making me scream Dreamer, dreamer, love and life is just a dream If you wanna set me free, boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da Take me anywhere you please, boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da
1985177	1986238	Thank you for watching!
2032012	2033033	Thank you for watching!
2210925	2216733	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
2221471	2224554	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, or at least most of you were.
2224654	2228857	I'm just hearing in the chat room that there was a dump, and most of you got dumped.
2228937	2235623	And I can tell that most of you got dumped because my listener count updated, and there's a whopping one person listening at this very moment.
2236584	2237465	And it's probably me.
2237485	2238125	It must count me.
2238185	2239466	We love you, one person.
2239487	2240327	We love you, one listener.
2240688	2241628	I don't know what happened.
2241668	2245672	Live365 must have taken a dump or something, and you all got dumped as a result of it.
2245752	2246813	So I apologize.
2248414	2253477	But it sounds like if y'all reconnect, of course, obviously if you're hearing this, you did reconnect, so there's no point in me saying.
2253977	2257959	So tell anyone who was listening and got dumped that you gotta reconnect, and sorry about that.
2259820	2261942	Anyway, let's see.
2261962	2262862	SoCalKicks is the one.
2262922	2264383	SoCalKicks says he's the one listener.
2264443	2267725	I don't know though, it updated, and then he said he got dumped, so I don't know.
2267785	2269726	I think one person managed to stay connected and...
2270296	2272798	The other ones that we had on there dropped, so I don't know.
2272818	2273378	That's crazy.
2274179	2275620	You said you had to take a dump during the break.
2275660	2278102	I didn't know it was like that.
2278222	2278663	Not like that.
2278703	2279643	High mouth humor.
2279884	2282666	So I've been trying to make some new promos for you.
2282906	2284087	You like the Captain Jack one?
2284367	2284968	All right.
2285008	2286709	The melody about Peter Pan's on there, that's good.
2288453	2288693	All right.
2290075	2291516	What, when Melody soils herself?
2291836	2292457	I don't know.
2292537	2294799	Well, I mean, it's good that she liked it so much.
2294859	2297741	It's not, you know, if she peed her pants, that wouldn't really be a good thing.
2297761	2299082	I'd have to, you know, clean the carpet.
2300664	2301765	It's smell in here.
2305949	2307350	Can we go one night without potty humor?
2307370	2307410	No.
2308851	2309312	No.
2314346	2315267	Everybody's leaving.
2316709	2316969	Anyway.
2318090	2319152	One thing we wanted to talk about.
2319192	2321034	Some news that we got this week.
2324361	2340966	At the Golfland chain, which is a pretty big chain out here in the west coast of arcades in California and Arizona, where one could argue that DDR was kind of born and nurtured between the Golflands and the Metreon and some other locations like Arcade Infinity.
2341306	2345387	Golfland is one of the big players in getting DDR exposure.
2347667	2351889	Most of their arcades have a Dance Dance Revolution USA machine and then some other kind of mix.
2351929	2353509	Most of them have Max 2 by now, I believe.
2354572	2361135	The news came over this week, and this still should be considered a rumor until these machines are actually there and in place.
2361295	2363937	But for all practical purposes, it's pretty much been confirmed.
2364397	2368319	All the USAs are going out and being replaced with 4th Plus machines.
2369219	2373681	Which is good news, because 4th Plus is a very cool mix.
2373721	2375502	It's much better than USA, that's for sure.
2376042	2376743	I don't know, man.
2377283	2378003	I like USA.
2378043	2380805	You like your one-foot songs, one-foot freestyles, huh?
2380925	2382205	Man, what am I going to do now?
2382646	2383386	I can't play anything...
2383885	2386808	I mean, what am I going to do?
2388189	2388909	I'm screwed.
2390451	2392773	Play Beul over and over.
2393653	2396256	Does that mean that El Remo Tropical is going to finally get a rest?
2396356	2398698	That they don't just hit the first song that they see?
2398718	2401720	No, because if you... We found this out when we had Fourth Mix.
2401780	2405523	If you just keep hitting the first category that's up, have you never been mellow?
2406885	2408146	Just like the old days.
2410147	2410388	So...
2413091	2416137	And apparently 4th Plus bootleg kits are only like $200.
2416177	2417500	If even that, $175 I'm being told in the chat room.
2420646	2422406	So, pretty darn cheap.
2422446	2424127	Sweet.
2425827	2426627	What do you think this means?
2426647	2429708	This is very interesting that USA is kind of disappearing.
2429728	2433749	I guess there's always been this kind of urban legend, urban Bomani legend.
2433769	2435289	I don't think there's any truth to it personally.
2435329	2444431	But they've always kind of said that, oh well, Konami doesn't really mind the Max 2s and the import mixes as long as they keep the USA machine there too.
2444511	2446452	You know, they're kind of supporting the USA Bomani.
2447577	2448838	Well, look at Stockton Golf Land.
2448858	2450139	They never had a USA machine.
2450179	2450720	No, very true.
2450960	2451480	Import machines.
2451921	2454483	Like I said, I think it was all just kind of hearsay.
2454523	2455544	But you look at the Metreon.
2455964	2457686	They're not allowed to have anything but USA machines.
2458046	2463230	You can argue the movie theater upstairs has two Max 2s now, but they're not owned by the rest of the Metreon.
2463250	2465612	They're leased or whatever, so they don't have to play by those rules.
2467094	2467794	You know what I think about it?
2469042	2469482	Bullshit!
2470163	2473564	What, the bullshit that they had to have a USA for an import?
2474085	2478627	Does anyone else find it really odd that Konami, I mean, Max 2s, they are literally everywhere now.
2479087	2482829	Everywhere, there's DDR everywhere, and there's pretty much no USA machines left.
2483189	2489073	It's pretty obvious that Konami is not putting out a new USA mix anytime soon unless they do it kind of out of thin air.
2489133	2491694	It's going to be something they announce and have out on the street within a month.
2492817	2495038	All the new USA stuff's for the home mix.
2495679	2501262	Obviously, we had all that stuff a while back about Konami closing their coin-op office and all this.
2501282	2504624	But that doesn't mean, you know, that doesn't mean Konami coin-op is shutting down completely.
2504664	2507026	They're just going to have a third-party distributor, most likely.
2507206	2508006	Let's just put it this way.
2508046	2513710	I mean, if you put a 1.5 machine and a USA machine next to each other, it's like comparing two yoga songs.
2514070	2516692	Sure, they're going to be a little bit different, but it's not much better.
2516792	2518753	It's just pretty much the same thing.
2519733	2520394	So, it's...
2521406	2522907	It just, USA sucks.
2523088	2524509	Everyone's tired of playing it, they're like, eh.
2524889	2525349	Oh, yay.
2525490	2527231	I'm like, 20 songs I get to choose from.
2527431	2527912	Woohoo!
2528372	2528772	Let's see.
2529473	2529973	20 songs?
2530133	2531935	Or like, 100 and some songs?
2533536	2534037	20, 100 and something.
2534297	2535578	Mmm, that's a tough one.
2536359	2538720	I think, I mean, and plus you got battle mode.
2539201	2539921	Battle mode's cool.
2541062	2544225	Although the little kids will fail faster.
2544645	2547127	So, you know, they'll get off the fucking machine so I can play.
2547147	2548168	So, yeah.
2548388	2548629	Yes.
2550715	2551436	Excellent.
2552417	2555560	Is this kind of weird to anyone else that Konami just doesn't seem to care?
2555660	2560184	That Konami of USA does not seem to care that all these Japanese mixers are coming in and taking over?
2561107	2566130	And if they do put out a USA Second Mix, it's going to have to be damn good, or else nobody's going to blink an eye.
2566370	2572593	Well, it might not be that they don't care, but, you know, imports, sure, they're not bringing money to KOA, but they're still getting exposure to it.
2572713	2573093	Exactly.
2573133	2574414	And bringing in the PlayStation.
2574514	2575074	Exactly.
2575254	2584179	People in other places, like, we're used to having a million DDRs all over the place, but I'm sitting here thinking, okay, I have grandparents and family in the Midwest and Missouri.
2584839	2587661	If I want to go back there anytime, I'm not going to be playing DDR.
2587861	2591564	Because there is none within 75 miles of the town they live in.
2591584	2593005	And it's one of the bigger towns back there.
2593365	2595146	Some of these people only see it on their vacation.
2595166	2598068	They only see it if they're going on a trip for some reason.
2598388	2601791	They don't have the option to just drive 5 minutes to a golf land and play DDR.
2601811	2606214	They're going to see an import, but be like, hey, that's cool, and go buy it for the US PlayStation.
2606980	2607581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2627806	2628586	Let's just put it this way.
2628647	2633071	How much does it cost to license music in Japan versus how much does it cost to license music over here?
2633091	2640718	Very true, which is a big thing to say here, although Max is going to be pretty cool because he's got 20 new licensed songs, not in any other mix of DDR.
2640978	2651448	They knew that USA wasn't anything special or great or anything, and I think that they realized that all the imports are getting all the business, and they're not even going to bother because they know...
2652830	2654450	We're fine with all of the import stuff.
2654910	2659891	You know, on a somewhat related subject, we have in the chat room, Rue makes a very good point here.
2660251	2662752	Why is it that no one ever watches the good people on Max 2?
2662952	2664652	They always watch the newbies on USA.
2665072	2670373	If you see a USA mix, like we have at Rosewood Golf, and you see a USA mix right next to a Max 2, nobody is ever watching.
2670393	2672534	You could be playing the hardest catastrophic on Max.
2672554	2675054	You could be playing Max Unlimited over on the Max 2 machine.
2675634	2679555	Somebody right next to you is doing so many men one-footer, and they're getting a huge crowd.
2679655	2680235	Why is that?
2682083	2686649	Because no one can read the arrows, you know, if they're new to it and they're watching people doing Catastrophics.
2687349	2691254	The other thing I thought of is also, well, we all started back somewhere.
2691314	2695379	It kind of brings us back to the nostalgia of, wow, I remember when that song was hard.
2695419	2696400	Now look what I'm doing.
2696800	2699704	And a lot of people see a lot of Catastrophics.
2699884	2701666	There's honestly not that many newbies anymore.
2703571	2714682	They're just the people waiting up to go play, and so you figure, okay, the guy that's playing the catastrophic is probably going to pass this song, the next song, the song after that, whereas the newbie is probably going to fail pretty soon.
2715063	2716684	Who's going to get up to play first?
2717064	2722470	So you think it's kind of like an Assembling of the Wolves thing, like, let's watch them fail, you know?
2724042	2726764	Yeah, now we can throw stuff at people, but, you know.
2726804	2730466	Somebody else at our black lab says it could be American pride.
2730526	2731806	It's just, they see USA!
2731866	2735188	It's just like, hey, it's a red, white, and blue mix.
2735268	2736409	We gotta support that.
2736929	2744213	Yeah, on the next machine they put in, like on the fourth plus, they should say, fuck you American capitalist pigs on the thing, so that they don't look at them anymore.
2744373	2745494	Maybe they'll stop looking at us.
2746014	2746254	Yeah.
2747055	2747815	You don't like the attention?
2747835	2748996	I thought you were an attention whore, Brad.
2749696	2749936	No.
2750497	2750697	No?
2750997	2751097	No.
2751822	2752802	Put down your microphone, Rob.
2753003	2753203	No.
2753443	2754243	Give me your microphone.
2755884	2757244	This is the Brad show.
2757584	2759085	All Brad, all the time.
2759385	2759785	Thank you.
2760185	2761225	Here, I mean, you can join.
2761525	2763866	You know what they should put on the next mix of DDR?
2764507	2766727	I like country Weston dancing.
2766907	2769248	Oh, that'd be great.
2769428	2769768	Oh, no.
2770108	2771309	Oh, God, he's got a sound clip.
2772209	2773750	Oh, he's going to play something.
2775390	2776030	Oh, sorry.
2776491	2776711	I mean...
2778084	2781625	I've been married long time ago Didn't we just hear this?
2782645	2784645	Oh, damn it, Rob!
2785805	2787186	I'm gonna burn down your trailer.
2787486	2788746	What is that?
2788806	2790646	It's the all-American DDR!
2790706	2794327	It's the Jeff Fosworthy, you might be a redneck if mix.
2794387	2804268	So does this version of DDR have, like, you know, parked cars on it, too?
2804348	2806549	Yes, it's DDR mixed with Silent Scope.
2807049	2807129	What?
2809608	2838929	ddrmixit.com, thank you melody complete with the dancing dog that you can't fucking kill no matter what you do well they need to have in the background the guy calling out you know the square dance you know commands and stuff in the background there he's just like okay everybody, do-si-do, up, down, up, down square dance revolution yeah and don't forget you have to like beat your wife and things like that and drink and smoke too much and yeah
2839562	2840662	Thank you for watching!
2862149	2863149	I don't know what's going on.
2863309	2863730	Keep going.
2864670	2865151	On with the show.
2866372	2873176	So, I was playing DDR the other day, and I felt this weird tingling in my ass.
2873457	2879061	And I was like, so, Max 300 does this... Anybody?
2881402	2883884	Sorry, I'm sorry, but we're trying to remedy the IRC situation.
2883904	2884605	Oh, okay.
2884625	2884765	Okay.
2885740	2889241	All I know is I'm not very comfortable at this moment right now.
2889841	2890442	That's all I have to say.
2890462	2894143	Did you ever see that scene in Screamers where the guy's head exploded?
2896103	2897724	I'm having a very good time.
2898184	2899104	People like me.
2903466	2903886	Thank you.
2904786	2905626	I think that's what I was on.
2905666	2907467	You need to do the other server.
2908719	2910540	Rob, let Bradley take care of it.
2911180	2912721	Let Bradley work on the situation.
2912741	2916083	Well, I'm kind of monitoring the broadcast to see if we lose our listeners again because it might be us.
2916543	2916883	I don't know.
2917083	2917403	We'll see.
2917943	2918224	Anyway.
2919964	2920925	Code red, code red.
2920965	2921825	The building's on fire.
2924006	2927788	And if you don't reconnect to IRC outgoing, you set the building on fire.
2927908	2929929	Okay, that's Milton from Office Space for anyone who didn't know.
2932003	2935564	It's been confirmed the Taliban have attacked Orange Lounge Radio.
2938825	2940186	Do not be afraid.
2942507	2945408	We got the IRC situation fixed and they're all in there laughing.
2945428	2946308	Everybody be alert.
2946828	2947368	Are you alert?
2947989	2948429	I'm alert.
2950529	2951290	What is alert?
2951370	2952210	I want to know what alert is.
2952551	2955333	This is what happens when shit breaks down, just everybody goes nuts here.
2955393	2956654	Oh yeah, I'm very alert.
2957595	2958555	Excuse me, can I check your bag?
2958575	2965080	We knew without Jamie here tonight it would all fall apart, so just, you know, fuck the show, let's just have random quote night.
2965240	2968062	Maybe we should all go join her with a warp core breach in Vegas.
2968403	2968943	Road trip!
2971325	2976709	Little does Jamie realize we are standing behind her as she's, as she is singing it right now.
2977169	2978190	Won't she be surprised?
2979295	2987360	I'm hoping to get the phone thing, so I really want the phones on this show because I want to be able, I don't so much want people to be able to call us, but I want to be able to call other people.
2987980	2999547	I'm not, I'm really skeptical with having random people call this show because there's, I mean, no offense to anybody listening because I'm sure you're all intelligent, but there's really a lot of idiots out there in the Bomani community I don't want calling this show.
3000568	3005511	Why don't you just have a phone in here and put it on speaker and dial out or something?
3006522	3006942	Yeah?
3007583	3008483	Well, I don't know.
3008784	3009844	It would sound kind of crappy.
3009864	3011726	It might work, but it would be kind of crappy.
3012086	3013707	But, of course, we do have two microphones.
3013987	3017109	The only problem is it might sound kind of weird for the person on the other end.
3017190	3017610	It might work.
3017630	3018150	We could try it.
3018591	3026156	Well, I could maybe borrow something that I have at work that we could hook up to the phone line where you can plug it in.
3026376	3029258	I always like it when people want to steal things from work for the show.
3030399	3030799	Oh, I'm sorry.
3030839	3031500	Long-term borrow.
3032020	3032820	Oh, borrow.
3033141	3033361	Well, I...
3036092	3037993	I have a paperclip from work.
3038513	3044295	Anyways, back on the... Our chat room is foaming at the mouth with the idea of phones.
3044595	3045395	Call us, call us, call us.
3045995	3050157	Anyways, yeah, we should probably be back on topic here.
3050317	3058940	I remember, actually, something was said in the chat room that jolted... Remember that thing I was trying to think of earlier that I couldn't think of why I wanted people to email me at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com?
3060220	3065502	If... Some people were listening last week to our Dollar Mendy coverage of that tournament that happened a couple weeks ago.
3066215	3067056	www.DarkSakura.com
3094002	3095723	Definitely tape something over there and send it to us.
3095743	3096704	We'd love to play it on the show.
3096884	3101127	Get in touch with me at OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and I'll give you all the information that you need.
3101147	3104029	And in the chat room, I know that you posted my edits.
3104109	3107211	In fact, I saw that you didn't have the names on there so I sent you another email with the names.
3107631	3111133	And they're also in the zip files, all the information about the edits.
3111153	3112054	Check that out.
3112294	3114355	Cool, cool.
3114375	3121680	Well, I'm still kind of going on this fourth plus thing now that we realized we haven't lost the whole damn show.
3122501	3122581	Um...
3123988	3127311	Do you think 4th Plus is the best choice to replace USA?
3128012	3128272	Why?
3128833	3130514	Because it's like the best mix.
3130674	3133597	It's got like pretty much a little bit of everything.
3133617	3134277	You're going to find...
3135387	3141449	Most of the songs from other mixes before 4th on there, you know, and it doesn't have any of the crap songs on there.
3142830	3147691	Also, a lot of stuff that was on 5th Mix or anything like that is already on Max 2 anyway.
3147731	3149372	It's like most of the stuff that was good.
3149752	3150932	What about 5th Mix?
3151272	3151773	Yeah.
3152533	3154213	So, I mean, 4th Plus seems pretty good.
3154654	3159655	I think it probably has one of the most, you know, the largest sound collections.
3159675	3161916	And you're not going to miss all the 3rd Koreans that get replaced?
3167597	3170338	Well, only half.
3170478	3175980	You know, the non-third-plus Korean songs like Starion, Hogism, those ones are not going to be there.
3176000	3177080	Those weren't in fourth anyways.
3178201	3180581	Yeah, but Qua, they're there, yeah, fourth-plus.
3180641	3182222	Oh, but Qua, oh yeah.
3182262	3186083	Don't you just want to play Beautiful 21C over and over and over and over?
3186323	3187444	Because I know people that do that.
3191265	3191645	Oh yeah.
3191785	3192806	Oh, good point, good point.
3193386	3197007	Twen in the chatroom says, Fifth Mix is slightly better because it does not have Let Them Move.
3197714	3198234	Good point.
3202657	3206159	But anyways... I don't have anything to say.
3206179	3207520	Why don't you hand me the microphone?
3207960	3209061	You don't ask for the microphone.
3209081	3215385	You don't have anything to say.
3215625	3218767	Let's play what is this link I'm being sent in the chatroom.
3218827	3222710	I'm guessing it's for an upgrade to 4th Plus and showing how expensive it is.
3223310	3224030	Ah, no, no.
3224230	3226512	Somebody is selling their screen name of Satan.
3228718	3229199	Super Lee.
3229500	3234588	You know what's funny is that one of my good friends is Morpheus on AOL.
3236091	3238555	And he's had this for years and years.
3238615	3240358	Of course, right after The Matrix came out,
3241030	3241610	Pound Orange Lounge
3270706	3272009	I have a different topic.
3272029	3273452	Go for it.
3273472	3274253	What do you want to talk about?
3274574	3278221	I was thinking about another tournament here in Sacramento.
3278682	3279023	Okay.
3279083	3279944	Yeah, we want to do one.
3281067	3282269	So when are we going to do one?
3282921	3284482	Well, when the place has let us.
3284762	3291345	There's some things going on at one of the local arcades is looking into getting a brand new machine.
3291385	3292406	You know what I'm talking about.
3292446	3294047	A very wanted machine.
3294447	3302791	But we don't know if it's going to... It's kind of one of those things where we aren't trusting the rumor until we see it for ourselves there in the arcade, which is what most people should do instead of spreading rumors.
3304172	3309794	We're kind of waiting to see if they get that machine, because if they do get that machine, we want to have it there and do two kinds of tournaments.
3309874	3315057	Do DDR and for the other machine, because there's a lot of demand for that kind of tournament.
3315877	3316958	I know what that new machine is.
3316978	3318618	A Bunga Bunga.
3320479	3320719	Yes!
3321140	3322240	A Bunga Bunga tournament.
3322320	3322821	Very free.
3323281	3325002	Mambo!
3325062	3325602	Tournament.
3327103	3328323	Okay, no.
3331385	3331545	Not...
3334101	3342244	Hey, what about our Bimani Lanzon that's over at RVGL that's supposed to be setting up a tournament?
3342665	3345986	Like, that guy knows how to set up a tournament, but... I smelled alcohol in his breath.
3346026	3346546	No, I'm just kidding.
3346586	3346806	I didn't.
3346846	3347106	I didn't.
3348787	3349127	Sorry, what?
3349307	3350308	Did he drink vanilla coke?
3350568	3353409	Would you please explain the vanilla coke and alcohol joke for our listeners?
3354446	3362008	Okay, so Irene is sitting here as we're coming into the show with a glass of vanilla coke and ice, asking everyone, does this taste like alcohol?
3362408	3364749	We're trying to figure out if someone spiked her vanilla coke.
3364789	3365689	We're still not quite sure.
3365709	3372692	Like, seriously, I've never had vanilla coke with ice in it before, but it tastes so, like, strange, you know?
3372712	3378173	It tastes like someone put, like, alcohol or GHB or something in it.
3379474	3381214	I gave you the date rape drug, Irene.
3381234	3383715	I want to go to my room and get fresh.
3384502	3386984	Well, now that you mention it... Oh, that's how you got pregnant.
3388925	3396489	Well, we weren't going to mention it now, but next segment... Next segment, Irene's going to be on our webcam.
3397090	3401813	Hey, we have to earn the money to play this song somehow.
3403654	3404554	Yeah, okay, yes.
3404654	3405755	Oh, yeah, that topic.
3405795	3406636	Yes, Irene.
3406936	3410678	Isn't it kind of boring to have PA and freestyle anymore?
3411479	3411759	Well...
3413359	3413779	Wild Gerbil PA What?
3413799	3415561	Wild Gerbil PA You're just going to let loose Wild Gerbils on the machine?
3415581	3417763	Or if somebody messes up, it's just going to be BOOM!
3417823	3418223	Bunga Bunga!
3442793	3447258	You know, I'm thinking like, you know, routines are good.
3447398	3457270	Like, you know, people can spend a lot of time and prepare their routines instead of someone going up, oh, you know, I think I'm the shit and I'm just going to pay my $5 in PA or something.
3457330	3460294	I think routines, we should focus strongly on routines.
3461074	3470663	Like, you know, people actually thinking up something to do and, you know, making it look nice and stuff as opposed to someone just doing hand flaps and all that stupid shit.
3471083	3471463	I agree.
3471503	3473585	We saw some real shitty routines at SCAT.
3473605	3474686	And that's because, I can tell you why.
3474726	3485755	It was from the people who would get up there at the registration desk, because I was sitting there at the registration desk, and there would be those people that would come up and go, Well, I don't know if I should enter improv freestyle or routine freestyle.
3486076	3486176	Um...
3487361	3489663	Well, what song could I do a routine to?
3490604	3494307	It's like 11 o'clock that morning and they're just going to pull a routine out of their butt.
3494327	3495948	They have no step charts with them.
3496369	3497870	Yeah, I don't know anything.
3497890	3499751	I don't know what you're talking about there, Rob.
3499832	3504916	It's not like I got up there thinking I had memorized the song and it fucked it all up.
3505296	3509479	It's wonderful, because if you saw Loki enter the tournament, I think he was one of two people to fail his song.
3510020	3516724	And he actually knew, I mean, I can vouch, he knows the song he was doing by heart, and he knows it on stealth and everything.
3516764	3518105	He just, oops, you know.
3518746	3525111	I'm sad to see that you, by technicality, place underneath some of those other people, but, you know, it's just technicality.
3525131	3528893	I got zero.
3528913	3530274	Hold on, Melanie, don't you want to share?
3530735	3531015	Oh, okay.
3531035	3531115	Okay.
3532890	3537972	I was thinking, like, maybe we can have a DDR couples routine.
3538413	3540614	Well, we kind of, you've seen that done before.
3540654	3543395	Like, you mean like couples who sleep together?
3543535	3544175	Yes.
3544635	3545796	Couples that fuck.
3546476	3548597	Yeah, but you know, this is the thing.
3548697	3549658	Well, you got them.
3549718	3551579	She's suggesting the rice princess.
3551739	3552579	This is the thing.
3552599	3554240	Well, yeah, I don't know about that.
3555606	3556326	A couple of what?
3556366	3556726	I don't know.
3557286	3558727	A group thing.
3558927	3559227	What?
3559967	3560707	What the what?
3561227	3562748	No, okay, this is what I was thinking.
3563488	3564708	Yeah, sweetie, I get it.
3564888	3565848	Shut up.
3566068	3567329	I don't know if our bed's big enough.
3567369	3569409	Hey, punch you in your throat.
3570289	3571570	Oh, shit.
3571630	3577491	What I was going to say is that this is going to sound very discriminating, but there's a reason why I would say it.
3578172	3582476	I would think the couples tournament would only be male-female.
3583177	3586340	And only because you know that there's going to be two guys... Hater?
3586480	3586881	Hater?
3587061	3587581	No, no, no.
3587641	3588142	This is why.
3588222	3589223	Here's my rationalization.
3589303	3590004	Discriminator?
3590044	3590965	You're a discriminator?
3590985	3600534	There's going to be two really good guys that are going to pretend to be gay or something and want to enter together and do some routine and blow away everyone else.
3601336	3608975	The only issue I see with that though is that, you know, male, female.
3609745	3614370	Honestly, there aren't that many female freestylers out there, so it kind of makes it kind of difficult.
3615071	3618434	But hey, I think I'd pay money to see Mel B act gay with some other guy.
3620856	3621697	That was not good.
3622498	3625221	Okay, once again, Mel B is not gay.
3625701	3626682	I can prove it.
3626922	3627483	I have proof.
3627503	3630126	I don't believe you, but I'd pay money to watch him act that way.
3630326	3631347	Just watch him pop up.
3632047	3633327	Oh, you're right.
3633527	3634008	I saw that.
3634028	3635668	What about females and females?
3635808	3640069	Like, you know, two females wanting to get on there and do some secret rendezvous action.
3640309	3640929	No, I'm kidding.
3641129	3641469	Hater.
3641789	3642329	No, no, no.
3642349	3643950	Homophobe.
3643970	3644050	No.
3644110	3645130	I hate you.
3645390	3646510	I hate you, Rob.
3647470	3647890	Sit down.
3647910	3648651	You don't know me.
3649071	3649371	You don't.
3649811	3651151	Why did I get silent all of a sudden?
3651271	3652071	Every time I talk.
3652171	3652371	God.
3653232	3654352	Fuck you, log.
3654372	3658833	No, we're both.
3659353	3659473	No.
3660689	3663552	Unfortunately, no, we haven't dropped Dark Tetsuya.
3663912	3665553	Actually, we're at a ratings peak right now.
3665613	3666254	I don't know why.
3667015	3672960	We haven't brought up shirtless Emi or anything, but somehow... No, that's three-titted Emi, okay?
3673180	3673941	Get it right.
3674441	3675202	Pantless rage.
3675222	3680326	Speaking of which, Konami hasn't released any more of the DDRPC characters.
3680646	3681367	Very disappointing.
3681387	3682268	Valencia and Guy.
3683012	3683533	Last week.
3684453	3686075	Pack number two did come out last week.
3686095	3688056	Well, we covered that last week.
3688076	3688356	Did we?
3688376	3689597	I'm talking about number three.
3689617	3692900	Yeah, we thought they'd be doing them every Friday, and they missed a Friday.
3693060	3694201	Shame, shame.
3694582	3695742	It'll probably be out on Monday instead.
3696903	3701347	They're trying to get, you know, Paul Terry to do the motion capture.
3701387	3704089	Oh, what do you want to bet Paul Terry is one of the unlockable characters?
3704510	3704870	Nice.
3706591	3706872	Nice.
3707072	3708733	Shirtless, three-titted Paul Terry.
3708753	3709514	Nice.
3710274	3710695	Nice.
3713616	3716898	I think now's a good time to go to break.
3716918	3719559	What do you guys think?
3719599	3719859	Terrible.
3742229	3743309	What do you guys want to hear in this break?
3743389	3744150	Give me a request, somebody.
3744490	3745530	Metal Gear Solid.
3745970	3748811	Oh yeah, I promised Matt we'd hear the Metal Gear song from Beatmania.
3749991	3750571	The second one.
3750651	3753472	Metal Gear from Beatmania 3rd, Momo Moga.
3753612	3756313	Okay, we'll get to some of these songs in the break.
3756533	3757933	Alright, take a break here.

4155214	4160776	Oh yeah, I was going to say that this last break was brought to you by the letter M. Yep.
4161036	4161557	And why is that?

4201801	4202701	Let's talk to Melody.
4202741	4204222	She's our special guest here tonight.
4204902	4205783	Let's talk to Melody.
4205803	4207883	You're special tonight.
4209044	4210124	You put that mic good and clear.
4210324	4212205	Just pretend you know you're going to give it some head there.
4212585	4212985	There you go.
4214045	4214326	What?
4214566	4216406	You've got to get nice and close to your mouth.
4216466	4217947	Wow.
4219367	4219768	Thank you.
4220668	4221668	I appreciate that.
4223549	4224409	You don't have to.
4226210	4226830	Yes.
4226970	4229251	So you happen to be a machine owner.
4230021	4230961	Yes, I am.
4231041	4240824	Now, because there's a lot of people's fantasies to own their own machine, you know, I don't know, as they're thinking about late at night, as they're falling asleep, gosh, I wish I had my own dude.
4241244	4242524	Is it everything is cracked up to be?
4244185	4246466	Yes, Brad?
4246546	4249666	Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I was going to say, does this machine vibrate, or what?
4250727	4256388	If you jump on it really hard, yes, it does.
4257589	4258349	Yes, anyone?
4258469	4258789	Anyone?
4261648	4264209	What made you want to get a DDR machine?
4264889	4266970	I liked DDR and Mel needed to get rid of it.
4268090	4272672	So I talked really nice with my mom and said, Mom, I need money.
4273012	4274673	She gave me money and I bought it.
4276273	4277234	I did it the lazy way.
4277554	4279895	How often do you use it?
4279915	4281575	It kind of depends on what I'm doing.
4281615	4283716	If I'm kind of busy during the week, I'm like, eh.
4284577	4284977	Whatever.
4286299	4287580	Now you have a Solo 2000 machine, correct?
4287640	4288220	I have a Solo 2000.
4288300	4293665	I have to ask, since you got your Solo 2000 machine, have you played Solo 2000 in the arcade?
4294315	4294855	and many more.
4316947	4320992	You do play in the arcade still, Max 2, because it's not... Max 2, 5th mix, 4th mix.
4321092	4323435	Yeah, they're not the same as Solo 2000.
4323996	4325398	There's almost nothing, you know.
4325478	4329883	Solo has a lot of songs that don't appear on any other mix, like My Baby Mama.
4330023	4330264	Yep.
4331025	4332106	Stuff like that.
4332246	4335050	So, you know, strut your funky stuff and...
4335834	4338095	Lots of stuff, and it's not like you can play six-panel.
4338716	4342618	It's not like you can play six-panel much anywhere else, too, which I'm just teaching myself how to do.
4342778	4344399	So, yeah, I play it normally.
4345259	4346080	Depends on what I'm doing.
4346200	4349542	I can play it anywhere from every day in a week to not even once a week.
4349642	4350843	But it's just in my backyard.
4350883	4353344	It's just kind of sitting there saying, I'm bored, I'm going to go play DDR.
4353484	4353764	Right on.
4353784	4355726	You looking into getting any of the upgrades, possibly?
4355746	4356567	Like a Fork Mix Plus?
4356787	4357568	Eventually, maybe.
4357608	4358189	Eventually, maybe.
4358489	4361973	If I can find a way to keep the Solo 2000 preserved, because I like it.
4362073	4366137	It's a rare enough machine that you're not going to find it everywhere on every street corner.
4366940	4373582	So if there's a way to preserve it and I get money, you know, providing I ever find a job, yeah, I probably will do something with it.
4373662	4383405	You know how I was telling you a little earlier off the air before the show, Melody, they have a bootleg, or I don't know if it's bootleg or what, I think it's bootleg, a fifth mix upgrade for a solo machine.
4383785	4386546	I'm actually being given a link to a website here.
4386566	4386826	Oh, really?
4386886	4387406	www.DarkSakura.com
4409215	4410516	So it's definitely not official.
4410796	4413258	This site is not official looking at all that I'm looking at.
4413618	4416400	And I'm not going to endorse it over the air because they can pay me if they want that.
4416680	4422163	It's not like the Solos had hell anyway considering it's been broken and it had to be sent to KOJ to be fixed.
4422263	4427326	Yeah, so apparently it's about $1,000 if you want to upgrade that puppy.
4427346	4428006	That's kind of a lot.
4428026	4432129	I'd just buy another Solo for on the cheap and do it that way.
4432149	4433690	Upgrade one that I don't care about.
4435805	4436806	Back to the original thought.
4437908	4440771	It's really easy to just hop out there and play whatever I want.
4441492	4444195	Amazingly, I haven't had anyone really over to play it yet.
4444235	4446077	I keep saying, yeah, you want to come over and play solo for free?
4448376	4451217	I'm coming next weekend.
4451277	4452718	I'm going to come play solo for free.
4453238	4454939	And maybe we can do something and tape something for the show.
4454979	4455459	So I don't know.
4455479	4456639	We'll see.
4456759	4458440	Everyone's always like, you keep it outside.
4458460	4462942	Yeah, actually, you can keep a DDR machine outside as long as it's undercover and you take good care of it.
4463342	4469664	I've got the pad in the bar because I have the one that actually has the bar in the real pad, not that raised shit.
4471139	4474861	Yes, I have an actual bar on the machine and it's an actual single pad.
4475381	4479604	But as long as you just keep that covered up and keep the rest of it just careful, hey, it's fine.
4479664	4481124	It's survived a winter already outside.
4481404	4484886	Plenty of people in the chat room are saying, I'll come play, I'll come play.
4485126	4488928	Do I need to give out my DDR frames?
4489228	4490649	Hey, money talks, you know?
4491810	4493371	Have you found ways to make money off the machine?
4493572	4495413	No, I'm the only one who plays it.
4495574	4497536	You don't take it out to make appearances to places?
4498076	4499518	Eventually that might be in the works.
4499578	4505644	Not really that there are some ideas that are being kicked around with using it in conjunction with some other things.
4505704	4507285	That might eventually happen, might not.
4508206	4510168	What's that place that the other one got kicked out of?
4510389	4510789	San Diego!
4510829	4514533	We should place it there and make a little money off of that.
4515962	4518564	I thought the idea was... I think this was actually an idea that came up on the show.
4518584	4520906	I think this was something Jamie suggested a few episodes back.
4521326	4528691	That we get a truck, get your solo machine, if you're willing, board it up on the truck, drive down to San Diego, and play it in the parking lot all day long.
4529231	4532734	See, that's one of the reasons why I'm glad my machine is not listed in machine locations.
4532814	4537297	When I saw that, I almost was ready to email that chick and be like, I dare you to take away my solo, bitch.
4538978	4541480	They're saying in the chat room we should go on a California tour.
4541500	4543201	Put the machine in the back of a truck and get it to go...
4545703	4550688	That might actually be... I think we need to look into something like this.
4550728	4556814	When all the Christmas parades come up, we should enter the Orange Lounge crew or something.
4556834	4560297	We could get a DDR float and get some of us playing on the solo machine.
4560317	4561218	That would be awesome.
4561258	4563960	And we'll have drinks with arrow-shaped ice like I found.
4563980	4566563	I found an ice cube tray that's arrows shaped.
4566963	4571245	We'd have the Shriner guys driving around in little carts right in front of us.
4571805	4575527	Behind us we'd have the high school cheerleaders going woo woo.
4575907	4580489	If we have high school cheerleaders back there, half the guys are going to be looking at that and not the arrows on the screen.
4580549	4581129	You know this.
4582630	4583910	Get a U-Haul, that's an idea.
4583950	4586671	Get a U-Haul and have a mini tourney inside the truck.
4586711	4588172	I think you might cook yourselves.
4588252	4589673	It's kind of asking for trouble.
4589733	4590133	Or the machine.
4592199	4593300	Oh, you want to say something, Joe?
4593600	4597643	I don't know, he was kind of doing this, I wasn't sure if he was doing, fight the power, fight the power!
4599404	4603588	Those cheerleaders, they need to be dressed up like the nurse from I'm Alive.
4603608	4609532	Should we get them giant syringes so they can ride up and down on them?
4609552	4609592	Oh!
4610253	4613355	You know what, I suggest, you know what, Melody, you and Irene...
4614887	4616088	Let's get you some syringes.
4616368	4619509	I'll give him a nice syringe right up and down.
4619990	4621130	Actually, I'll tell you what.
4621150	4623751	Jamie, I'm sure, would love to do her Emmy cosplay.
4623771	4625332	She's got a great Emmy costume she could do.
4627373	4628494	Are we dorks or what?
4629034	4631255	Better yet, next year we could do the Pride Parade.
4631275	4633236	Because everybody knows that DDR is really gay.
4636154	4637254	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4637714	4645139	Backpedaling here a little bit, but the thing about the U-Haul and playing a tournament in the U-Haul, that brings up an idea for a new type of tourney, PA thing.
4645379	4657487	PA-ing while you're accelerating and decelerating and stuff from 50 to 60 miles an hour, then stop on the brakes and try to not... Backing up into your roommate's garage.
4657767	4659448	Hey, inside joke.
4660936	4663257	PA on Bay Area Highways.
4663617	4666618	That would add an entire new element of difficulty to it.
4666698	4669238	If you win, or if you win, you get to stay on the truck.
4669278	4670879	If you lose, out the window you go.
4670899	4673659	Yeah, if you win, you survive.
4673679	4674980	Roll, Grandma, roll!
4675940	4677320	Make sure you roll when you hit the ground, right?
4677380	4677581	Yeah.
4679561	4684682	I could insert a lame stop, drop, and roll joke here from last tournament, but then you were there, so I wouldn't get a laugh from this room.
4684722	4686463	But in the tournament, oh, you were there, right?
4686483	4686643	Yes.
4688337	4688978	I was black.
4689219	4690120	Alright, there you go.
4690400	4693264	Okay then, remember, stop, drop, roll.
4693524	4700172	That was a classic Orange Lounge moment brought to you by... Yes, Melody.
4700192	4700673	Melody as well.
4701989	4707633	But eventually, as far as I know, a Solo 2000 tournament might be a possibility.
4707953	4712216	Hey, I know a Solo 2000 that could be used for it, if people bribe me.
4713057	4714578	Everyone drop me a PM.
4715778	4716839	Should I spell the name?
4717960	4722263	They say that with throwing people off the truck thing, rate the bar for dear life.
4726727	4737488	I'm already getting sponsorship offers here from various websites wanting to promote the DDR in a U-Haul tourney.
4739009	4740369	Alright, hey, how about this?
4740569	4752791	Now, speaking of raping the bar and stuff, we could put, okay, for our next PA tournament, we could put a nice little hot wire attached to the bar so when someone goes to grab the bar, they're met with a nice little jolt.
4753357	4753657	Zap.
4754117	4754517	You know what?
4754557	4755698	That's not a bad idea.
4756598	4761219	We should do that for the next Sacramento tournament.
4761239	4764520	For Perfect Attack, we can hook up a little... You can do that with a battery thing.
4764560	4765381	Hook it up to the bar.
4765401	4767041	If you touch the bar, you get a little zap.
4767061	4767441	Bolt 2, motherfucker.
4774397	4775138	You're a dork.
4775918	4777380	Oh, surprise, surprise.
4777440	4778001	Hey, look at my shirt.
4778181	4778921	I got this new shirt.
4779021	4779722	I see your shirt.
4779822	4783666	For the people in the radio land who can't see it, it's an 8-bit theater shirt.
4783906	4784126	Yes.
4784987	4787430	My wonderful Irene, Rice Princess, got this for me.
4787450	4788050	This is wonderful.
4789131	4791413	Everybody at the store stares at me and goes, what a dork.
4792134	4792995	But they did that anyway, so...
4794696	4798119	The chat room saying it would be like that pain station pong game.
4798159	4798799	Have you heard of this?
4798839	4803402	That pong game that you play, and if you fuck up and the ball gets out of the zone, you get zapped.
4803803	4804523	Your finger gets zapped.
4804543	4805304	This is a real thing?
4805484	4806565	It's the pain station.
4806605	4808846	Yes, some Dutch guy, I think, came up with it.
4808886	4811008	If you can give me a link to that article, I'd love to look at that.
4811088	4813829	Oh, we came up with an idea, Timmy and me, or something like that.
4813849	4818813	It was Beatmania with a foot at the bottom, and when you messed up, the foot would kick you in the groin.
4820225	4821305	Didn't we come up with that?
4821345	4823446	That was like our second episode or something.
4823486	4825927	We said the DDR would have the vibrating foot.
4826587	4829328	Oh, well, this is something I thought of.
4830388	4833769	Anyway, any other thoughts on tournaments?
4833849	4835370	Machine ownage or I don't know.
4836110	4836610	Hey, Smelly.
4837291	4838671	Machine ownage is cool.
4838731	4839111	Do it.
4839771	4841072	Everybody should buy their own machine?
4841732	4842292	Yeah.
4843373	4844433	To do it, press A.
4846978	4849902	Oh, I've been given a link to the pain station.
4849982	4853606	But seriously, it is pretty cool to be able to just say, I want to play DDR.
4853626	4854707	I don't want to have to deal with anyone.
4854727	4855728	I don't want to have to deal with lines.
4855908	4857210	I'm going to go outside and play it.
4857390	4859933	And honestly, if I could get it inside somehow, I would.
4859993	4863497	But my house, that just doesn't really happen because I own too much crap.
4864145	4867447	Okay, the Pain Station is basically a game of Pong.
4867527	4872409	The only difference is that if you lose, the Pain Execution Units will hurt you.
4872689	4874170	Pain Execution Units?
4874350	4888197	There's a heat lamp which burns your hand, an electrical circuit which shocks the hand, and a whip which rapidly whips the same part of your hand over and over very fast with a wire, says Volkar Marwau, co-creator of the Pain Station.
4888237	4889177	I keep wanting to say Pain Station.
4889217	4890878	Why did this become popular?
4892119	4896501	We can't help but wonder what the designers were going for when they came up with this torture game machine.
4897122	4899723	It's the PlayStation for Sadomasochists.
4899943	4905227	Morale says, I was always interested in combining computers and the real world, and I wanted to create a computer game.
4905607	4909629	We decided we would do a game with pain, and we picked Pong because it's easy to play.
4910049	4911991	The pain station brings in the body and...
4912851	4915312	makes you feel the media so it's a new experience.
4915873	4924337	They've tried it before with the biofeedback and rumble packs, so it's a logical progression to go from rumble pack to, you know, being whipped in your finger.
4925098	4928580	Because there's more to video games than nice graphics.
4928780	4929480	Can I make a comment?
4929900	4930080	Yes.
4930641	4931461	They already have this.
4931521	4932542	It's called Chrono Cross.
4936946	4942189	Do you know what happens when you go off screen as long as all the boxes are clear?
4942209	4958760	You know, you have to be clear because if you did last season, you'd have to, like, go off screen Oh, wait, Brad, this is for you There you go Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night Take my wife, please You're married?
4959600	4959960	Not anymore
4963184	4967248	Oh, Brad, you got from SoCalKicks, you got a... Oh, no, you didn't just diss Chrono Cross.
4967308	4968049	Oh, no, you didn't.
4968790	4970391	Oh, no, you didn't.
4970691	4971632	Let me explain.
4971672	4976537	I don't feel like I have to, but... Okay, Chrono Cross is a good game, but you can't compare it to Chrono Trigger.
4976617	4977398	Just don't even try.
4977418	4977998	I'm sorry.
4978439	4979259	It's a good game.
4979660	4982563	There you go, thank you.
4982863	4984925	I haven't played it enough to form an opinion.
4987171	4987411	So, topic?
4987431	4987852	Should we... Topic!
4987872	4987992	Topic!
4988533	4989053	Let's talk about...
5007113	5008235	I can go over what's going on.
5008376	5009538	Oh, I know what I want to talk about.
5009798	5011061	Or we can do what you want to talk about.
5011081	5011862	Well, what do you want to talk about?
5012343	5012684	You go ahead.
5012744	5013525	We'll talk about your subject.
5013565	5015229	We'll take a break and we'll come back and do what I want to talk about.
5015349	5015609	Okay.
5015750	5018254	Well, brief sim world update here.
5018575	5018956	Alrighty.
5019361	5021883	Okay, Tourney Mix, still going on.
5022543	5027266	For some reason, the files are still down, so I'll have to wait for those to come back.
5028707	5038412	NMR of Team Guilo is actually going to be posting, supposedly pretty soon, all the Euromix 2 DWIs, so that'll be pretty cool.
5038452	5040914	We'll get to play the Euromix 2 tracks over here.
5041914	5044376	And that's pretty much it.
5044456	5046237	No new simulators out there.
5046337	5047618	There's been a couple actual...
5048783	5055066	There's a new DWI FileMaker, but I haven't gotten to try that yet, and that's about it.
5055186	5055807	Pretty boring.
5057147	5058528	Okay, and Rob, would you want to talk about that?
5058548	5058848	Alright, great.
5058928	5060449	Oh, yes, Dr. Tsu, you want to say something?
5061629	5075116	Yes, I just wanted to mention that I was working on some new result screen skins for Bomania DX featuring the... Well, I took the skins from 2DXStyle and created skins with them.
5076337	5076597	Cool.
5078049	5078329	DarkSakura.com
5185976	5189205	I had to cut from break to get some reaction from the room to that.
5189285	5190127	What do you guys think of that?
5190949	5191651	I'm moved.
5192774	5193998	And I need to go clean my pants now.
5195362	5198285	What were the various things you guys were yelling there as that was going?
5199146	5200287	It has no rhythm.
5200347	5205732	Basically, they were saying in the chat room, stop, kill it now, my ears, my freaking ears.
5206173	5209696	It's like being forced to watch Britney Spears without her being scantily clad.
5212319	5214601	Big thanks to Twin for that two minutes of hell.
5215282	5218065	Back to some music we hope you like here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5311511	5312074	This is my destiny.
5341247	5342288	Thanks for watching!
5382546	5383530	Thanks for watching!
5433014	5434715	Thank you for watching!
5595170	5597151	Bitch, get a new song.
5618459	5620920	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
5621100	5624481	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 10.
5625481	5628182	They said we would never make it... Your mic is on, right?
5628642	5629242	Yes, okay, thank you.
5629702	5631163	You are listening to episode number 10.
5631963	5635804	They said we would never get past episode number 2, and here we are into double digits.
5636004	5636604	Episode number 10.
5636864	5644466	I wish Jamie was here to celebrate in this moment as well, but I know she's off having a great time, and so... We still have her Warp Core Breeze.
5644486	5646027	We'll have our alcoholic vanilla Coke.
5646207	5646647	That's right.
5647047	5647127	Yay.
5648630	5652192	So next week is going to be, we're calling it episode 10 and a half.
5652293	5654994	It's not really going to, because we're not here in the studio, so it's going to be episode 10 and a half.
5655335	5657296	But then in two weeks we'll come back to episode 11.
5657916	5659838	All new intro, all new everything.
5659858	5661799	It's almost going to be like we're giving the whole show a face look.
5662920	5664241	Why are you going to have a new intro?
5664441	5666922	To keep things fresh, keep things lively, new.
5667423	5668864	You've only had 10 shows.
5669044	5671085	Well, it's just, I want a new intro.
5671125	5672586	You know how many times I've had to hear that intro?
5672766	5673847	It's a completely selfish thing.
5673867	5675108	I've had to hear that intro too many times.
5675368	5676589	Because I can make it better.
5677233	5680315	But it's a good way to fix it if it ain't broke.
5680515	5683297	Because I'm a man and I like to do that.
5683597	5691083	Our new intro is going to feature Paul and Terry.
5691903	5694305	This was something I was thinking about a little bit earlier today.
5695085	5696346	I know, I was thinking, imagine that.
5697747	5699228	DDR on the Game Boy.
5699288	5700109	Have you ever seen this?
5700389	5701110	What the fuck is the point? !
5704423	5707365	Can somebody explain to me what the fuck is the point of DDR on the Game Boy?
5708906	5712870	Those who can't afford to get the cool stuff, they have to go with the crappy stuff.
5713210	5714151	Okay, now, wait.
5714631	5717313	Come on, we played DDR, like, button-button revolution.
5717353	5718094	There's not much difference.
5718634	5721496	Oh, except for the, what is that, a 3-bit sound processor.
5721516	5722317	I guess that is a kind of...
5723900	5743748	Well, it's for those people that, you know, they're out there that are just hardcore DDR players that need, it'd be like, you know, smoking and having the patch on at the same time, you just can't get enough of it, so you're willing to, you know, settle for, you know, the little Game Boy version, too, when you're driving, you know, maybe to the actual, you know, arcade or that kind of thing.
5745143	5746164	New tournament thing.
5746325	5751531	Bring in your Game Boy DDR thing and play the song on the Game Boy and the arcade at the same time.
5751611	5753374	And we tally your score together.
5753534	5754034	That's so cool!
5754054	5755296	The combination of the score.
5755316	5756838	No, it's not.
5756858	5757679	You're right, it's not.
5757859	5758440	Yeah, I know.
5758560	5759942	I'm just trying to make it sound exciting.
5760042	5760683	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5760923	5761263	No, no.
5762819	5765301	I thought we could play some game here in the studio.
5766362	5770726	Because I don't know if you guys have ever heard the Game Boy renditions of your favorite DDR tunes.
5771147	5776272	I thought maybe we could play some of those tunes and see how long it's going to take you guys to guess what the songs actually are.
5776532	5777633	Name that tune DDR style?
5777653	5778594	Yes, it's Name That Tune.
5778895	5781017	It's Name That Tune DDR Game Boy style.
5781317	5782118	We're going to hear some of these.
5783806	5789950	Anybody can answer, so when you think you know, I'm going to set this mic down, and when you think you know, grab the mic and say the answer, okay?
5791091	5793592	I'm just going to set it down, and don't grab it until you know the answer, okay?
5793973	5799036	Now, don't look on the computer screen at the name, because it does come up on the screen, but I'm going to trust you all.
5799076	5801698	We're using the On Your Honor system, okay kids?
5802098	5805200	You're On Your Honor, okay?
5805420	5810683	There's a jar full of mints for the Retard Society, and it says On Your Honor, so that's what we're doing here.
5811004	5811164	Okay?
5816485	5817926	Oh yes, I'm gonna put it down.
5825787	5827688	I'm gonna start off with a really easy one, okay?
5836850	5837670	Something from Naoki!
5840003	5840443	Butterfly?
5842225	5843025	Yeah, I rule.
5843045	5843465	That's right.
5843545	5843986	Uh-huh.
5844586	5845387	I'm that geeky.
5845487	5846347	Woo!
5847208	5850190	I was going to guess V, but, you know, that's just... Okay, let's do another one.
5850510	5853792	You've got to kind of narrate this as you go along.
5853872	5854412	All right.
5854473	5854633	Yay.
5854693	5855613	Selecting new song.
5855633	5857414	This is going to be really easy.
5857615	5857975	All right.
5858015	5859796	If they don't know this, they're dumb.
5872322	5872682	and go!
5878004	5878905	Pink Dinosaur!
5879905	5881146	And you are the winner!
5884967	5886048	Woohoo, this song rocks!
5889189	5889649	Yeah!
5889849	5892170	I've got the funk in my trousers for sure!
5897112	5897853	Next song please!
5903240	5907722	My Summer Love?
5907822	5911964	It was like, I knew it but I was like, shit, what is it?
5912084	5918626	I hope you all enjoyed the Mr. T rendition of My Summer Love.
5934088	5934849	Is the mic on the ground?
5935389	5940332	Yeah, here we go.
5940392	5941473	Alright.
5941533	5942173	Doobie dub.
5942674	5943334	Doobie dub.
5945435	5946596	You know what I mean, goddammit.
5948237	5950879	Alright, song's stupid.
5951179	5952740	I can't think fast enough.
5953100	5953861	Here we go, here we go.
5960649	5961210	Dreamy Dream.
5962932	5963292	Yes.
5963812	5966015	See, the solo comes in good for something.
5970099	5971821	Unfortunately, you get nothing.
5978889	5979209	All right.
5988915	5989676	That's Paranoia!
5990456	5991036	Oh, it's Dropout!
5991056	5991116	AM3P!
6014893	6017335	I'm such... How long is it?
6017515	6019716	Just think J-Dog sliding around.
6020276	6020977	Okay.
6021457	6022238	To that song?
6022378	6022818	That beat?
6023358	6023658	Here we go.
6023678	6024299	Here's the next one.
6027160	6027601	Paranoia?
6027621	6028681	Yeah, there you go.
6028821	6031143	Not as tricky as you guessed that last time.
6031183	6031763	Okay, two more.
6031803	6032904	Here we go.
6032944	6033744	These are harder ones.
6034085	6042110	So this is... I think this is kind of hard.
6042130	6042370	Yeah.
6046796	6047536	I believe in miracles.
6047636	6048316	Oh, very close.
6048396	6048797	Sky High?
6048817	6048957	Yeah.
6069454	6076564	You know what's sad is the AM3P remix is actually probably better than the 303 bass mix on the Konomics there.
6076705	6077666	That's pretty bad.
6077766	6078387	That's all I got.
6078667	6083194	What do you think was better, the AM3P remix on Konomics or the Game Boy version?
6088542	6089002	DDR Man Soundtrack
6110347	6112289	because those are all ripped from the Game Boy games.
6112369	6114751	So I don't think it says there that they're ripped from the Game Boy games.
6114791	6116172	I'm not sure if he's aware that's where they came from.
6116212	6124420	And actually, if you're looking to actually play the horrible Game Boy versions, you can find the ROMs on bemoningstyle.com.
6124480	6125521	Also, they have the links there.
6126141	6127921	Now piracy is bad, young man.
6128202	6130462	Only if you, uh, own the cartridge.
6130602	6134083	And you have to delete it 24 hours after you, if you don't have it.
6134643	6136004	That is such crap.
6136124	6137424	I really need to go down.
6137744	6143565	Guys, I need to go down and delete about 500-some ROMs that I've got on my computer right now, because it's been 24 hours.
6144706	6145586	Longer than that.
6145626	6148427	And then delete them in, you know, the next 24 hours.
6148447	6148927	It's a...
6155556	6156657	Yay!
6157438	6160080	Yo, the chatroom, this is the chatroom's response to you, Brad.
6160660	6161561	Only 500 ROMs?
6162261	6163002	I know, I know.
6163482	6173610	I know, hey, I just wiped my hard drive, I need to go start... Hey, I also only have 56K, I'm sorry, we're not in the Bay Area where everybody's... Fiber optic, or whatever.
6173930	6175652	This is turning into a penis-sized competition.
6175672	6182277	This is, uh, a guy from Florida says, I got 600 Game Boy ROMs, I got 600 Super Nintendo ROMs, I got 1400 NES ROMs, I got 400 Genesis ROMs, so...
6184941	6187843	And you know what you can do with those?
6187944	6188564	I don't need to say.
6191026	6191747	You can play them!
6191987	6193168	Over and over, that's right.
6193288	6195229	He's been too busy downloading the ROMs.
6196330	6198752	He's like, I don't have time for girls, I don't have time for anything.
6199032	6199873	Give me my ROMs.
6200934	6202755	I'll have to go to get yelled at in a minute.
6203096	6203336	What?
6203816	6206158	Why is SoCalKick saying I don't have a wife?
6207421	6209922	Matt, since you're kind of our unofficial official co-host tonight,
6235277	6237878	You've built your own metal pads for DDR, correct?
6238639	6242861	Yes, that doesn't really help my argument that I have a life outside of DDR.
6242921	6245462	Well, so I'm great that we can go from that topic to this topic.
6245842	6248604	Tell us about what a pain in the ass it is to build your own pads.
6248644	6252085	Well, it's a very big pain in the ass, especially if you don't know how to solder like I do.
6252866	6256908	So, my pads actually are really, really, really ghetto.
6258028	6258489	They have...
6259369	6261530	All their connections are actually all electrical tape.
6261930	6262690	It's really crap.
6263170	6265331	But it works from now and then.
6265871	6269992	It only comes apart if I throw it in the back of my car and drive around with it.
6270412	6271893	But they're pretty cool.
6272273	6275734	It's basically based off the DDR at home pads.
6276274	6280275	I believe there's a huge thread in DDR Freak with directions on those.
6280335	6284016	I was about to say, where did you get the schematics on how to build your metal pads?
6284157	6288578	Well, a long time ago when the melting pot was online...
6289338	6291760	We used to get them there, but actually there's a huge link.
6291780	6297166	It's about a 98-page thread that's on DDR Freak under the DDR at Home.
6297226	6298146	It's pinned at the top.
6298487	6300248	You can find all the links there.
6300929	6312080	And what I did a little bit differently than what they had on there is instead of taking actual PlayStation controllers and wiring them to that, I ripped apart my two old homepads that I had, softpads,
6312760	6323693	and wired them to that because they're a hell of a lot easier to wire to because it's just a big, huge, flat metal thing you have to solder to instead of drilling the hole in the controller and getting the solder on there perfectly.
6324394	6326636	I tried it the other way and it was really hard.
6327217	6333324	Then for the arrows, I just took the same pad and chopped up the arrows and put them under plexiglass and they look cool.
6334765	6337686	What are some other home pads you'd recommend commercially out there on the market?
6337966	6341887	Because there's a lot of third-party pads out there.
6341907	6345389	Other than the official Konami pads, is there anything out there that you'd endorse?
6345869	6349450	Well, I've played the... Because I was looking at Software Etc.
6349470	6352931	today, and they have these Mad Catz pads, and they look so stupid.
6353852	6356094	I don't know how well they play, but they look awful.
6356134	6360739	They look like cheap 50s, come on everybody, let's square dance type pads.
6360759	6365044	When it comes down to soft pads, they're pretty much all the same as far as the insides go.
6365244	6373593	I mean, really the only difference between the Konami official soft pads and the third party ones is they've got these really thin, almost like...
6374714	6375955	www.DarkSakura.com
6391282	6398025	The difference between the third-party ones is the third-party ones have almost like a barcode going across.
6398045	6405869	They've got just small, thin layers going across, whereas the Konami official ones have just the whole solid layer.
6405969	6409031	So you probably get better connections with the Konami official ones.
6409051	6409251	Right.
6410212	6415316	Also, on the top of some of the Konami ones, they're textured differently, which doesn't really do anything.
6415336	6420400	Have you ever seen the Dreamcast ones that have that funny little layer over the top?
6420540	6423542	It looks like tracing paper or something over the top of the pad.
6423562	6424383	It looks very odd.
6424423	6425184	It's very cool, though.
6425204	6426385	I don't know if you've ever seen them.
6426725	6427446	Never seen that.
6428506	6435913	Now, taking a step up from the soft pads, you've got the ignition pads, which I played these at Fanime this year.
6437228	6438729	and everyone says they're really cool.
6439029	6439729	I hate the things.
6439870	6441070	I think they fucking suck.
6441390	6443972	Now wait, I think we gotta, you're talking about the ignition pads?
6444072	6444272	Yeah.
6444312	6451476	I think we gotta counter-argument here because Glenn here, Lolo, who I haven't introduced yet, he's in the studio, he actually has an ignition pad and what do you think?
6452356	6457819	I have one of the new ones, the Ignition 2.0s, and that's how I passed my first CATA.
6458580	6460881	So I can pass Dynamite Rave at home on that.
6462065	6466047	Okay, well, you know, in my defense, I played Ignition 1, Pat.
6466107	6468668	So, obviously they've probably gotten better.
6468768	6476332	The problem I had with the last one is, even though they did have raise buttons, which was nice, the problem was is they're raised so much, when you're playing on them, it just feels weird.
6476612	6481935	And it actually, you know, really hurt my ankles after just playing about one song.
6482735	6488078	And they were pretty responsive, but it was just, it hurt the hell out of my ankles, so I couldn't play anymore.
6488198	6490659	It's still not as good as the arcade, but...
6491835	6492816	I can pass a cat at home.
6493056	6494036	I mean, that's all I have to say.
6494517	6495597	I can pass a cat at home.
6495857	6497258	I can pass a cat at home.
6497799	6502661	And you can't do that on a Konami official pad without being halfway across the room when you're done.
6502882	6503142	Okay.
6504523	6505183	Then, let's see.
6505463	6508745	Now, a step up from those pads, you've also got the metal pads that are out there now.
6508765	6516790	They have the Kevin K pads, which Kevin K has been really getting reamed over because they suck.
6517070	6518551	He has horrible wiring on them.
6519311	6521633	Then there's also the new six panel metal pads out there.
6521673	6525796	They'll run about, I believe, 200 bucks a piece that you can actually find online.
6525836	6528778	There's tons of links in the DDR Freak at Home forum.
6529939	6530640	They look alright.
6530680	6532041	I haven't gotten to play on any of them.
6533120	6533500	DarkSakura.com
6559830	6587579	Nope, not at all, because after the cost of building them, which is roughly about $150 per pad, let's just say you're building the same one I had, and then you have to charge a little bit more to get some profit, actually, off of it, plus shipping, you're only going to be making about $10 a pad, and it's a good 40 hours worth of work to make each... It took me 40 hours to build two pads, and I built them at the same time, and...
6588519	6588820	and so on.
6601761	6602422	It's not worth it.
6602462	6605484	There was a guy that tried doing it a while back, Beat Gear.
6605924	6607325	Oh, yes, Beat Gear.
6607945	6613149	Which were like $400 for these pads and stuff, and I don't even know if anyone's actually gotten those yet.
6613169	6618512	I think maybe a few people have gotten them, but that was almost a year ago, I think.
6618993	6624397	It's just taken forever, so I wouldn't recommend actually starting a business that way.
6624597	6626438	Just make your own and be done with it.
6626758	6628179	Thank you for watching!
6647645	6650908	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
6651049	6656514	So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and as would be fitting, I'm going to play a request.
6656534	6659777	Somebody wanted to hear some more Orange Lounge, the artist, so here you go.
6659797	6670869	Orange Lounge Radio

6855354	6857291	and many more.
6972154	6977158	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

7006816	7009078	Step Squad to Orange Lounge!
7009438	7011259	This PDR sucks!
7011680	7015062	Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!
7031414	7032935	Well, there was one quick thing I did want to say.
7033015	7033275	Oh, yes.
7033535	7036377	So, Jamie's out of the state tonight.
7036417	7037818	She's off in Nevada and Vegas.
7037858	7042560	I thought, does anybody have any interesting playing DDR out of the state stories they want to share?
7042640	7043501	Like, not playing California?
7043621	7053707	Because California, if you ever looked at where all the machines are located throughout the nation, California is by far the biggest, you know, most well-populated with DDR.
7054107	7056108	Any funny stories about playing DDR out of state?
7057008	7057529	Have anything?
7057889	7059330	Melody or Matt?
7059370	7059510	Yes.
7060282	7069950	It's not particularly funny, but back when I was playing at O-Trick level, I happened to go to Reno and was playing on a USA for the simple fact that's all they had.
7069970	7074795	The Nugget, I think it was, and I scared the hell out of the locals.
7075255	7087425	I guess they thought they could only do basic, and here I come in and I have, like, La Senorita Trick, and I nearly full combo the thing, and they're just like, oh my god, look at her, and then I go to dub-by-dub advance, they're just like, oh my god, look what she's doing!
7087466	7087846	I'm just like...
7088809	7090511	It's not that great.
7090551	7091291	Come on, people.
7092773	7094254	That's about the only experience I have.
7094294	7097657	I'm waiting until I go back to the Midwest and really scare the crap out of them.
7097737	7098158	Right on.
7098418	7100500	And I hear there's some pretty good arcades in the Midwest, though.
7100860	7101701	If you can find them.
7101801	7102561	Yeah, if you can find them.
7103963	7105364	Do you have anything to share, Matt?
7106324	7109648	Oh, well, my first game of DDR was in Lake Tahoe.
7109929	7111030	Mine first game was in Vegas.
7111210	7114254	Yeah, and that was pretty bad.
7114294	7120001	But anyways, a while back I went down... Actually, it was during my birthday, I believe, last year.
7120201	7121022	I went to...
7122003	7125325	Lake Tahoe, and Reno to go gamble because I was 21.
7126385	7131768	And so I went there and I got to play a third Korean that was in Circus Circus.
7133128	7135869	That really sucked because they had the stage pushed right up to the machine.
7135889	7139751	So it was like playing and hugging the screen at the same time.
7139791	7141112	I love DDR.
7141572	7142993	Seriously, it was pretty bad.
7143053	7147415	I had a bunch of drunk old people staring at me like, what the hell is he doing?
7147535	7148995	Why is he stepping on that machine?
7149396	7150036	What's he doing?
7150636	7151237	Dumb kids!
7151817	7152438	Something like that.
7153319	7153639	Right on.
7154059	7160144	Well, I hope Jamie's having fun out there in Vegas and I'm sure Melody wishes that Mel B's having a good time too.
7161446	7164248	Just not too good of a time.
7165229	7170734	As long as he's staying in the Vegas city limits and not going to any houses outside of town, everything's good.
7172653	7173833	That's the end of the show, folks.
7174294	7180618	And remember, any bribes for wanting to play Solo 2K can be PM to sharksgirl, S-H-A-R-X-G-R-R-L.
7180678	7181539	Nice little plug there.
7182720	7183820	Good night, Melody.
7183840	7184621	Anything else you want to add?
