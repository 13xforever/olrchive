48497	49398	You bitch!
49458	51298	Now let me check the zip code.
51318	52439	2-1-2-fuck you!
52459	54120	You have no morals, darling.
54220	58361	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching kiss of purpose.
59082	60743	Kiss my great news.
61463	63784	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.
63884	66185	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66225	67365	Me too!
67626	68366	Fucker, yeah?
68386	69266	I'm working on it.
70007	70447	Loser.
70587	71107	Lame!
71827	73028	I'm the size of my face.
74016	78519	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
78659	84442	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
84462	85883	I am your singing telegram.
90504	90925	DarkSakura TV
112225	118746	This is episode number 8 for August the 11th of 2002, and of course, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends tonight.
118766	119827	We've got Irene.
120247	120767	Hi.
121507	122047	Bradley.
122067	122667	Hello.
123027	123548	And Brad.
123568	124308	Hello.
125508	126208	Who's eating a donut.
126328	126868	And Tal.
127148	127488	Yo.
128529	131329	And this is the first time that Tal's ever heard the intro, also, I think.
132549	133570	It gets old really fast.
133590	134830	We're going to have a new one for Show 10.
135450	136690	Show 10, we get a whole new thing.
136710	138091	We'll have a whole new website and everything.
138711	138931	Yes.
140251	144615	It's going to be special.
144855	148718	We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
149279	153883	And I'm going to work in a request I've been trying to play for like the past three weeks.
154283	157586	But I know that Jamie has an extra special request to give out.
158166	160388	So this goes out to Kelly.
160448	161369	Happy birthday.
162029	163170	And here is your request.
163891	167034	Happy birthday to you.
168790	169173	Yeah, whatever.
169213	169637	We'll be back.
279434	282280	Can you keep me like a nasty girl?
282300	284404	You wanna nasty love?
285186	288693	I know that you want me honey, but feeling so much pain
361757	362758	Thanks for watching!
402669	411291	All the chains combined I don't wanna find my way to you I'd be reaching for my head Speaking the secrets of my heart To chase the sun
436965	437459	Thank you for watching!
468462	468843	Oh, Ash!
468863	476173	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
487177	489378	And that said, you heard a special request.
489978	497322	Bambi with Cowgirl and Mr. T, Take Me Higher from 2DX4 style, 2DX6 style, Silhouette of My Mind.
497342	498522	Oh, ass!
500403	503284	Jamie thinks quite the opposite of ass when it comes to Silhouette of My Mind.
503324	507146	That is like my favorite song and I have two fuck you's of the week now.
508007	508647	There's my music.
508667	509528	The last file is messed up.
509548	509608	Yep.
537165	544252	I just think it was funny how at least a good fifth of the people at the last Spiegel tournament were doing the booty dance.
544672	545253	That was awesome.
545273	555903	I remember seeing a routine where somebody was actually dancing to that song, and I swear it was like, if it wasn't the exact booty dance, it was heavily influenced by the 2DX4 style booty dancers.
556583	564528	and for those that don't know the 2DX4 style booty dancers, there are these two dancers that appear in probably five or six of the videos in 4Style.
564568	567650	I know they show up in Conga, Take Me Higher, what else?
568250	568990	Gary Gary Daddy.
569090	569771	Gary Gary Daddy.
570518	571859	No, they don't show up as star mine.
572219	572739	Shut up, Brad.
573159	573659	And Nasty.
574120	574480	Nasty.
574560	575921	Ooh, Nasty Bella.
576041	580963	Every time I hear Nasty, I think of the Janet Jackson song.
581043	587426	No, we're not talking about the booty dancers from Third Style, because Third Style also has, like, Third Style has some real, like, Jerry Springer, ghetto booty dancers.
587446	589147	The Fourth Style ones, though, were still booty.
590267	591368	They were like Booty Max.
592728	593369	Booty Max.
593929	596210	You know, Third Style may be Booty Deluxe, I don't know.
599686	601167	Remember the solo mix booty dancers?
602088	602528	No, what?
603049	612255	They were in the background of virtually every freaking thing on solo bass, and they were like ugly ass people who were just kind of busting their groove, I guess is the proper term for this.
613231	616612	Don't forget about... That's the reason to ban a solo machine.
616793	620294	About the badly animated booty dancers from the old Beat Manias.
620854	622455	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
623015	629558	That's not even like real videos, that's just like bad crappy animation, like two frames a second animation of like... They sure are booty.
630518	630778	Alright.
632779	635541	Oh, we're also being asked in the chat room, when am we...
637774	638174	We are speak good!
638194	639415	We are speak good!
666431	670555	So that means that there's another half of her floating around that's sort of pulsing and bloody and gory?
671516	672217	Ew.
676211	679372	And on that note, oh, let me plug the chat room real fast.
679412	685875	If you want to join in our chat room festivities, all you have to do is join any other side IRC server.
685935	694098	So if you just go and download MIRC at MIRC.com, and then you're just going to connect to any other side IRC server like IRC.
694218	695439	I have to interrupt this.
695479	695939	What?
695999	698680	That was the gayest hand gesture I've ever seen Rob make.
698700	699020	Shut up.
699040	699701	It's radio.
699721	700541	They can't see that.
700581	701221	They can't see it.
701261	701781	It's radio.
702182	702822	I could help it.
702862	703382	I started eating.
703462	704703	Thank you for watching!
716826	717707	And they did it again!
718168	725819	Anyway, you can join our chatroom at irc.eggheads.org Make it stop!
725939	727421	Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
727441	728943	Is this what kind of show we're going to have tonight?
729043	729704	I mean, honestly.
729724	731366	Well, we had pita stokes last week.
731386	733629	You know, 310 Emmy and Pantsless Rage.
735453	735973	Oh, Matt's here.
736834	738014	Matt's tardy for once.
738734	743036	What kind of punishment do we have for Matt?
743056	743716	Get the duct tape.
744117	744297	Okay.
744937	745177	Anyway.
745197	745997	Frosted shit.
751554	754315	We can make him drink the cigarette tree out back.
754715	755335	Okay.
755415	757695	We're not going to get into that.
757735	757935	Anyway.
757955	758716	Back to the chat room.
758736	760476	Back to my fuck you of the week.
760536	760776	Yes.
761236	762536	They know how to join the chat room by now.
762576	763557	Just channel Orange Lounge.
763577	763757	All right.
763777	765737	Let's get into Jamie's FU of the week.
767017	768478	I have two fuck yous of the week.
768638	770578	The first one goes to my cat, Shermie.
771638	773239	I finally double A'd.
773659	774259	I'm sorry.
774299	774579	Wait a minute.
774599	774999	Wait a minute.
775039	775299	I'm sorry.
775359	775659	I'm sorry.
775779	777120	This song just isn't going to work.
777160	778560	If you're going to rant about Shermie...
781616	793779	Okay, for the Shermie rant, you know, I'm not, I know I'm not a really great 2DX player, you know, I'm getting better, but I finally PA'd Silhouette of My Mind, not PA, why did I say PA?
794099	795899	I finally double A'd Silhouette of My Mind.
796199	804781	Shermie walks behind my PlayStation 2 and unplugs it before it saves, and I haven't been able to do it since I had like three pours, and that was driving me crazy.
805121	806161	Now play my pissy music.
808922	809182	Okay.
810296	811857	Now for my real fuck you of the week.
811997	814478	It goes toward germs and viruses.
816658	817739	I fucking hate them.
818619	819699	Tuesday, I'm happy.
819759	825421	Dan takes me to RBGL and I'm playing five games of DDR in a row and feeling good and happy and proud of myself.
825501	827362	I wake up Wednesday dead sick.
828222	829763	And I have been sick.
831016	831916	I hate nature!
832116	833637	I just wish the world would explode!
833817	835717	And then I could take over hell.
835737	835897	Well...
858445	859186	Wasn't that nice?
859546	861727	I don't mean explode, I mean implode.
861747	862868	So it would be a big black hole.
863408	865449	I have an FU of the week too, but this is a little silly.
867731	869732	My FU of the week is white t-shirts.
870592	881859	Because as you can see, I was eating chocolate ice cream earlier, and I had it sitting on my lap like a little container of Ben & Jerry's, and now it looks like someone pooed a perfect circle right on my shirt.
886767	895218	It does look like dried shit.
896639	901646	Actually, it looks like someone took that cigarette can you got in your back and someone smeared all that juice right there.
902887	903528	Yes, you can do it.
903668	904069	Wait, I've...
905313	906953	I don't... Yeah, I do have that.
906993	907894	Hold on a minute.
907974	910574	I'm getting Brad's Pissed Off Music.
910654	912295	I know I have Sexy Planet in here somewhere.
913155	914075	You don't get Sexy Planet.
914095	918396	You're going to have to settle for something... What is this?
920156	920696	This works.
920736	921117	Fine.
921757	926778	Okay, see, I'm kind of getting... I think the Fuck You of the Week is getting a little old, so I'm going to do a Fuck Me of the Week.
928258	929398	Irene, would you fuck me?
930659	931219	Alright!
931579	931839	Thank you.
934880	935460	Not right now.
935480	939382	The bathroom is down the hall.
941443	942304	Okay, use the closet.
944164	946326	I have one thing to say about that.
950027	950408	That's all.
950448	950728	Thank you.
951948	953029	That's what I feel like doing.
953069	955330	It takes me a little bit of time to load the sounds.
955370	957191	I'm not super fast.
957231	958171	Five minutes ago, she called me.
958292	958632	Shut up.
958772	958972	Anyway.
959955	960615	Oh, they're already done.
961115	962755	The chat room wants to get in on the fun.
962775	964076	I've got another FU of the week.
964936	972417	Since this one comes from DSCS SoCalKicks, he's been a longtime supporter of the show, so I think he deserves a FU of the week.
972657	973257	What song will we give him?
973277	973817	We'll give him this.
973857	977558	We'll give him the Dancing Pumpkins song.
979178	986900	SoCalKicks gives FU because he could not connect to Orange Lounge Radio tonight for quite some time because of his cable internet provider.
986940	989140	So, big FU to Cox Cable Internet.
989840	991701	Yeah, DJ Suck Cox.
995404	997425	Cox Sucks Cox.
997745	1000807	Hey, if Brad goes through on his offer, you'll be getting Cox Cable pretty soon.
1003148	1004890	One more whole show of internet access.
1006931	1008632	I love when this show resorts to potty humor.
1008692	1010713	I haven't mentioned that.
1010733	1014395	No, no, no, my turn, my turn, my turn.
1017037	1018118	Oh wait, you want Fairytale.
1018940	1020041	Oh, wait, this is for Matt?
1020801	1022322	Oh, Matt gets very tall.
1023423	1025104	I thought I had Rainy Men last week.
1025164	1025864	Yeah, that's true.
1025884	1027085	You got Rainy Men last time.
1030087	1031647	Okay, it's very subtle.
1031667	1033509	It's a subtle backdrop to your FU.
1033609	1042654	Okay, my minor FU of the week goes to last week's show and the very abruptly cutting off of my rant at the very end of the show for added humor purposes.
1043094	1045235	I didn't quite like that too much.
1046216	1046556	That's all.
1048556	1049016	Ha ha.
1049317	1049557	Ha ha.
1049597	1049877	Ha ha.
1049897	1050137	Ha ha.
1050177	1050497	Ha ha.
1051258	1051998	Ha ha.
1052018	1054480	Ha ha.
1075990	1077710	How about we say fuck you to the heat?
1078111	1081331	It's a hundred freaking goddamn degrees every goddamn day this week.
1081351	1084152	Well, you see, Tal, this is an international show now.
1084332	1087413	We have people in all different countries and all places in the United States listening to this show.
1087453	1089934	And in some places in the world, believe it or not, it is cold.
1090514	1091234	Fuck them, too.
1092194	1096055	But, you know, isn't it still typhoon season in Japan?
1096756	1097096	I don't know.
1097136	1100337	I remember my ex... Do I look like the weather girl?
1100377	1105358	My ex-t roommate Candice was in Tokyo and she was telling me about how people, like, go to work during typhoon.
1107814	1111636	Well... My girlfriend's in Japan and she says it's just really hot.
1112057	1112397	Okay.
1114158	1115779	I think your girlfriend's just really hot.
1118181	1119722	Well, you're gay, so it doesn't matter.
1123225	1124546	Oh, the cat's out of the bag, Rob.
1127768	1128449	You don't know me.
1128509	1129509	You don't know a thing about me.
1133372	1134313	Are you gay?
1136565	1136865	Are you gay?
1136925	1137226	Are you gay?
1137246	1137606	Are you gay?
1137626	1138186	Are you gay?
1165461	1165941	Huggism Huggism Ace
1184495	1187716	One of our last 3rd Koreans in town finally got upgraded to a Max 2.
1187756	1189397	They should just give it to me.
1190897	1192098	But what do you think of this?
1192758	1197300	It seems like everybody who had a 3rd Korean now has a Max 2 or a 5th.
1197600	1200521	Like everybody's upgrading to 3rd Koreans, but do you think that's a bad thing?
1201101	1207083	Well, first of all, Max 2 kits are really easy to find for certain reasons that we don't want to accuse people of.
1208043	1208443	Bootlegs?
1209584	1210164	I'd say it.
1213880	1232480	No, you go I don't know, I'm not really missing third tree And I went and tried to play one the other day And now, forgive me, I started I really got playing on fifth makes I got good on sixth and better on seventh I went back to try to play third I couldn't see the goddamn arrows for one That's your problem
1233700	1251709	They do grade harder on 3rd Koreans And 3rd Koreans are hella hard I mean, obviously you've tried to play SSR You probably grew up on that machine and stuff But I really don't miss it at all Sky was trained on a DDR USA machine You know what?
1252049	1263415	I can totally one-up it Yeah, I know, I know, girl I started on a 3rd mix and played a lot on a 1.5 Yeah, I used to play in the bathtub
1264435	1267179	and, uh, this is about DDR.
1270122	1272945	For, uh, Tyler here, uh, why don't you call the whambulance?
1275789	1277571	I swear to God I'm going to fire you from this show.
1277991	1278412	Just kidding.
1279602	1280583	I didn't hire him.
1280723	1280963	Fire me.
1280983	1281984	I'm not even getting paid.
1283125	1285826	Somebody needs to tell Milton that we fired him a year ago.
1287127	1289469	You are getting paid, you're just not getting the money.
1290749	1291930	You're getting paid in donuts.
1292831	1293891	Oh wait, you bought the donuts.
1294432	1297834	But if they take his stapler, he'll set the building on fire.
1299375	1300255	Set the building on fire.
1300916	1303558	I'm sorry, yes, you have a comment?
1303618	1304878	He's getting into my head.
1305139	1305879	Somebody brought donuts?
1306639	1307320	Matt runs out of the room.
1308675	1312417	Well, anyways, 3rd VK, it's not really that good of a machine.
1312477	1314898	It's old, it's nostalgic, it's got gentle strats, strictly business.
1315338	1323882	But, I mean, really, think about it, the Max 2 has just got so many more songs, so many... It's new, you know, like the guy keeps saying in 4th Mix over and over.
1324682	1325263	It's new!
1327023	1329524	3rd Korean, excuse me, it is the shit.
1331765	1332366	It's the poopy!
1333852	1334753	We need to bring on our filters.
1334773	1335913	Oh, you just got hit by the filter.
1336493	1337074	It's the poopy.
1338214	1340235	Third Korean is the... Poopy!
1340275	1341056	Freaking poopy.
1343237	1344157	It's the freak poopy.
1344697	1348839	I like the third Koreans because there's just so many cheesy third mix songs that are just so much fun.
1348859	1350680	Like all the good erotic songs were in third mix.
1350700	1353582	Do It All Night, Oh Nick, Turn Me On were all in third mix.
1353782	1355002	Although you can play them all in fourth mix.
1355082	1359024	There's something about being able to play like... What do I like in third grade?
1359064	1359564	Starion?
1360065	1360505	Hogism?
1361573	1365298	I even like the regular third mixes.
1365318	1369545	The third mix has this nostalgic value for me because it was my first DDR machine.
1370566	1374112	I had been playing on second mix since April 2000.
1377147	1392860	I had played on the first mix for PlayStation in February 2000, but I went to Anime Expo and there was this gorgeous looking third mix machine, and I freaking saw SSR the first time and thought I was about to pee my pants or something.
1393020	1395062	Jamie does win the award, by the way.
1401570	1403452	for being the most old school.
1404072	1404793	Congratulations.
1405313	1406754	Yay.
1406814	1407135	All right.
1410337	1413360	Sorry, the only fanfare I have is like an hour long, so.
1414200	1417983	If it counts, I saw DDR in 1999 and thought it looked stupid.
1419825	1421546	I was busy playing Buster Move 2.
1423148	1423448	Right on.
1424329	1425830	So we've talked about Bomani's Path.
1425890	1429433	Anybody else want to say anything about 3rd Korean, and are we going to miss it at all, or...
1431135	1432456	I don't get that, that was confusing.
1445757	1470357	as you said, the third got no play and then you're saying it'll still get no play but it'll get more play than it ever did well if it got no play and it's gonna get no play now then it's never gonna get any play oh, sure, inject your logic into everything you're not getting any play you get no dub, no dub from me you know yes I'm, see the machine
1471121	1473063	Everyone's going to attach their own value.
1473123	1474545	Everyone has their favorite mix.
1475125	1478289	Like, I still think to this day my favorite overall would have to be second.
1478829	1479070	Yes.
1479810	1480071	Why?
1480291	1481252	Oh, I know why.
1481292	1482553	Because... I know why.
1483154	1484876	It has freaking battle mode.
1485537	1486778	That's step battle, yes.
1487579	1488380	Step battle owns...
1489969	1492312	Oh, they are warning you.
1492372	1496657	Some of the locals that chat in the chatroom, Matt, are warning you no memory card slots at Folsom Game Room.
1496777	1497037	Sorry.
1498679	1498999	Duh.
1499860	1506268	One thing I do have to say that I like for the mixes after 3rd is that the old 3rd mixes had the memory card slots in the back of the machines.
1507289	1507529	Oh, really?
1507549	1508050	That I remember.
1508070	1509551	I don't remember ever seeing one of those.
1509571	1510853	I thought they had them in the back of the machines.
1513152	1513693	I remember.
1513733	1515875	They're asking us... Are you guys okay there?
1516055	1516855	Are you getting situated?
1517156	1519378	Are you getting a little too hanky-panky back there?
1522681	1527425	Anyway, we need to... I remember hearing that older mixes had them in the back of the machines.
1528506	1531548	Someone in the chat room is asking about the battle mode that was in 4th Mix.
1532009	1535972	Well, it's not in Kona Mix, and that battle mode is different from the one that was Step Battle in 2nd Mix.
1536453	1539996	Step Battle in 2nd Mix had blocks of arrows go up where both players go and...
1540609	1541391	Well, shut the hell up.
1544942	1547530	Ah, they're just messing with us in the chat room.
1549412	1552494	The step battle was this different feature in Second Mix.
1552514	1558917	A lot of people haven't seen it, but what it was, basically, you could dance a particular pattern, and then your opponent had to dance that too, right?
1559177	1559437	Yeah.
1559837	1563959	Basically, you would have all four arrows, but they would be basically clear.
1564500	1570163	They would come up in a particular pattern, and you would follow that pattern stepping on whatever you wanted to.
1570503	1572484	Of course, you couldn't do more than two arrows at a time.
1573184	1580450	and then they would come up red for the ones that you picked and blue for the ones that your opponent picked, but you still had to dance them all.
1581931	1582391	Very cool.
1582651	1586194	And it can get intense, you know, you have to be really good at sight reading.
1586454	1592779	So out of second mix's step battle, third mix's unison, and fourth mix's battle, what was the best?
1593720	1595601	The one that was in Disney's rave home version.
1596262	1597763	No, was that adoption?
1597823	1600025	No, there was A, B, and C. There was no D. C...
1602569	1606972	I didn't really, like, because I played a second mix and I guess maybe I just couldn't hear it or something.
1607312	1609213	But it was like, I didn't get it.
1609633	1611234	I was just like, what the hell is going on?
1611414	1612615	What the hell is unison mode?
1612675	1613976	I never ever figured that out.
1614676	1618098	Basically, unison mode was you had one set of arrows in the middle of the screen.
1618418	1622461	And, like, you both had to dance the green ones and then, like, one person had to do the red ones.
1622481	1626143	It's like the battle mode, but it was harder because there's only one set going up the middle.
1626403	1626983	You got it.
1627003	1627904	Hey, they're going to fight.
1628544	1633091	That was the best part about 4th Mix's battle was it goes, they're gonna fight!
1633171	1640722	And then like, if you're in an arcade where the machines turned up really loud and the announcer says that, you'll get a bunch of those kids that call DDR gay and stuff, they'll turn around and go, what?
1642106	1645928	I remember playing the one on third mix, me and my girlfriend tried to do Jam Jam Reggae Maniac.
1646348	1651651	Now, Jam Jam Reggae Maniac is hella hard to begin with, especially when it's flat and the colors are all weird.
1652011	1654973	And we tried it, and we had no idea how to play a unison mode to begin with.
1655413	1657314	So it was like, what the fuck?
1657354	1658575	They're red and green and blue!
1659015	1659856	I stand corrected.
1659896	1662757	The arrows that both people have to dance to are actually yellow.
1662937	1663978	Green was fourth mixes.
1664298	1664678	Yeah.
1665399	1673607	I actually do think that I like the 1 and 4th mix better overall, but you know, still for purely nostalgic value, the second mix, Battle Mode, was really fun.
1673867	1674388	It's that battle.
1675362	1677643	Oh, you'd like this suggestion we're getting in the chatroom, Jamie.
1678124	1681245	Jabberwocky wants to make a DDR Puyo Puyo mix game.
1682026	1685508	Now, actually, if I'm not mistaken, there is a Bomani Puyo Puyo game, correct?
1685548	1686248	It's not Bomani.
1686848	1687869	Well, okay, I'm sorry, yeah.
1687889	1688429	It's not Bomani.
1688449	1689510	It's Bomani-like.
1689850	1691291	I can't believe it's not Bomani.
1691671	1702957	It basically plays almost exactly like Parappa, where you have your... I mean, the pattern's a little bit more complex, but you have your patterns come up, and, you know, your characters dance to it.
1703491	1708755	For those that don't know what Puyo Puyo is, it's probably best known in the States as Kirby's Avalanche.
1709176	1711798	Puyo Pop for Game Boy Advance.
1712718	1715961	Or didn't you have a Sonic version of it too on Sega?
1716041	1717702	Dr. Robotnik's Mean Mean Machine.
1717762	1719564	And yes, I do own that version too.
1721105	1723647	I have all kinds of versions of Puyo Puyo, but that's besides the point.
1724968	1728831	Okay, we've talked about some old school Bomani stuff.
1728871	1730252	Let's talk about some new school.
1731019	1732381	If that's a term I can use, new school.
1732701	1733682	New school.
1733802	1737025	DDR Max USA, some slight new news on it.
1737085	1742551	I mean, this was something I kind of already been assumed, but it has been confirmed by Konami of America.
1742971	1748177	We are going to have licensed tracks in Max USA, and not only are they licensed, they're going to be exclusive.
1748857	1750499	So that means they're new.
1751320	1751961	It's new!
1754101	1757204	On top of that, there's really not much else to add until we get further announcements.
1757244	1759986	I think Max is still, what, about three months out for USA?
1760586	1763869	So we'll probably be getting some more songs in the next few weeks.
1764669	1765390	Did you have something to say?
1768912	1770053	See, I thought you were raising your hand.
1770113	1773636	Anyway, anybody want to comment on that news or...
1775089	1777530	Isn't it coming out in November or was it October?
1777570	1778431	I don't remember really.
1778851	1783373	But I'm just waiting to play something like Sonomalette 0.5 speed, you know?
1785774	1788916	Is it going to replace our USA machine at RVGL, do you know?
1788976	1790757	Or are they going to replace USA's?
1791917	1793818	It's not an arcade machine, it's a home version.
1793998	1799501	And by the way, just my own little happy New Bay Money news, in five weeks I'll have my 2DX controller.
1801195	1807220	But yeah, there's no Konami of America arcade unit anymore, so there isn't going to be any upgrades ever.
1807740	1808521	Not true, not true.
1809362	1813645	They still could distribute through their third-party distributor, whoever they're going to team up with.
1813685	1816648	So there's really, we don't know what direction that's going to take it.
1816668	1819990	It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing, but probably going to be a good thing.
1820431	1821031	We just don't know.
1821591	1822873	So it's too early to say.
1822933	1825054	All we've got on the front now, though, is this new home version.
1825314	1826075	It will be special.
1826636	1826796	So...
1828511	1831512	Okay, anyone else want to say anything about Max USA coming up?
1832552	1834133	No, I mean, we just don't know a lot.
1834153	1834513	It's new!
1835473	1836133	It's new!
1836233	1837633	And that's about all we can say to it right now.
1838154	1844955	I'm hoping we can get some interviews in the future on this show with people that could tell us more, but we'll see.
1845015	1847416	We'll see if they'll even call us, or if they'll even talk to us.
1847916	1848676	Who are you?
1849557	1851077	What is this Orange Lounge show?
1853237	1858460	What I always do that works is you poison them first, and then you say if you want the antidote, then you gotta do the interview.
1859000	1859300	Stop it.
1859640	1863462	Anyway, also new, new school, Euromix 2.
1864603	1868704	It's pretty much, from what I'm hearing, it's Max 2 without everything good in it.
1869925	1876228	Like, Oni modes and... The interface is so freaked up, it's not even funny.
1877950	1883154	Actually, there is a pretty decent review of it on the DDR Freak boards in the United Kingdom Forum.
1884175	1886297	Really nice review, first-hand experience.
1886758	1892783	Which I believe links to another site called... I think it's musicgames.com.
1893263	1894164	I don't remember the site of it.
1895465	1896446	Dancing Games, thank you.
1896486	1899808	It's dancinggames.com, which is, I believe, a Euro-based site.
1901385	1901966	Something like that.
1901987	1902508	They'll tell us.
1903770	1908300	Pretty much, it's Max 2 without the Onis, without any unlocks that we know of.
1909227	1912829	Moreover, it's got the thing where you have to pick your difficulty after you pick the song.
1912909	1914529	It doesn't tell you the difficulty beforehand.
1914690	1916030	Yep, no groove meter.
1916350	1920112	And it's like USA, where you have to pick the song first, and then you'll pick the difficulty.
1920652	1931537	It's got some ridiculous looking... I mean, the song selection looks really cool, though, and it's got some of the Oni Mode songs already unlocked to be able to play, like Hysteria, and I forget which other ones.
1931937	1932577	But, I mean, think about it.
1932597	1937820	You can play the new songs with three levels of difficulty, and none of them are actual Oni difficulty level, I would think.
1940813	1945477	I'm being corrected on the site, that's actually dancegames.com is the name of the site.
1945517	1948760	We were close enough, alright.
1948880	1951143	So that'll be interesting to hear more about.
1951263	1953585	There's all sorts of new songs in there.
1953625	1955807	You get to dance now to Nick Carter and Steps.
1956067	1957328	Isn't that amazing?
1957429	1958349	Oh, I'm sorry, Aaron Carter.
1958950	1961352	Nick's the one that's actually a Backstreet Boy, huh?
1961372	1963054	Does the excitement ever start?
1965436	1971301	From what I... I haven't heard much about the steps, but I guess it's nothing too special, or we would have heard more about them.
1973222	1976385	I'm sure we'll see them for The Sims pretty soon, so we'll have to wait for this.
1976965	1977706	Good deal, good deal.
1978707	1988575	And for those of you who have been dying to dance to this song, for those of you who have been dying to dance to this, Kylie Minogue, Can't Get You Out of My Head.
1989435	1993439	I'm sorry, I can't hear the song without thinking of that one video from Anime Expo.
1994791	2002475	The Dancing Stage Party for the Euro Playstations will have Can't Get You Out of My Head by Kylie Minogue along with other songs.
2002535	2004856	An unknown Bloodhound Gang song I know is on the list.
2004936	2005916	Bloodhound Gang, oh.
2008877	2009278	We don't know.
2009358	2012359	But if you've ever just been dying to dance to those songs.
2018168	2018448	Thank you.
2018908	2021890	So that'll be coming out soon, and I haven't heard much about that.
2021950	2025572	I guess it's supposedly some kind of... Oh, Matt seems to know.
2026673	2028554	It's got the nice new shiny cabinet.
2028714	2030035	Oh, you're talking about the home version.
2030075	2030735	Yes, the home version.
2032596	2034597	Now, I saw pictures of the new Euromix cabinet.
2034637	2035878	It doesn't look any different at all.
2036058	2039140	It's just like a darker silver chrome color.
2039600	2041741	Well, it's got hardware upgrades, supposedly.
2041801	2043082	No one really seems to know.
2043662	2045143	But apparently Euromix 2 doesn't use it.
2046249	2047651	Thanks for watching!
2061105	2074261	But the home version thing, I'm still saying I'm jealous because the Europeans have two exclusive mixes with licensed songs in them, whereas we had two regurgitated pieces of shit, and now we're finally getting some new shit.
2074341	2075302	So what's up with that?
2075342	2079667	Well, I guess the whole theory is, though, is to get the new shit, you have to play the old shit.
2080313	2086516	Basically, is that they've got to prove that the old shit's successful to invest money in the new shit, basically.
2086536	2087377	Yeah, but that's not the point.
2087397	2091098	Like, Konami didn't want to spend, because licenses in America are expensive.
2091479	2095361	I mean, look at how much they're charging internet radio out there to play.
2095741	2097282	Well, you know, it's expensive, though.
2098082	2104245	Well, I point out to you also, like, when we're talking about licenses, Britney's dance beat has only five songs on it.
2104785	2107747	Five songs, that's all they could afford to put on the damn game.
2108547	2112409	So, basically, it's a matter of... You would buy a Britney Spears game anyway.
2112829	2115130	Because it's by the... Well, it's a good half an hour long rental.
2116210	2122012	But, um... I still would not pay money for anything with Britney Spears in it.
2122952	2129375	Because my money is worth more than, uh... than your tits and ass, I guess.
2129935	2136798	Basically, the bottom line on why we get recycled stuff is basically, it's kind of like... I guess it's kind of having to prove yourself.
2136858	2137578	Unfortunately...
2138428	2146655	I think a lot of folks at the Konami of Japan who kind of have the rights to all the DDR stuff, they don't really believe the DDR has kind of taken off here yet.
2146675	2148617	They give up, let them move in every mix.
2148637	2151119	Well, let's release this and see how it does over there.
2151159	2157765	And then now that it's doing well, it's like, okay, we'll give more of the rights and let you license your own stuff and spend the money on that and all that stuff.
2158366	2164591	So, yes, I'm being also mentioned in the chat room saying radio stations give out million dollar prizes.
2164611	2165212	They have money.
2165908	2166448	Not this one.
2166748	2167049	No.
2167569	2168529	I pay to do this show.
2169350	2170430	You can give me a dollar.
2171371	2173172	If you want to send us money, hey, great.
2173212	2175193	Maybe we'll set up a PayPal thing.
2175213	2175513	I don't know.
2178515	2178715	Yes.
2179455	2181436	Send us a dollar of nine and you get a vanilla cup.
2182737	2183398	Yats can get it.
2183938	2185419	Anyway, so we'll see.
2185459	2189181	As soon as we get more news on Max USA, we'll definitely give it over to you guys.
2190875	2193116	Also new, being location tested.
2193137	2194998	We talked about this last week on the show a little bit.
2195038	2199400	8th Style is brand new and is being location tested in Japan right now.
2199940	2203382	And some of the MP3s got leaked, but they were kind of bad quality.
2203422	2209886	However, now we've got some very good quality 2DX 8th Style MP3s that have been leaked to the internet.
2209906	2213248	And they've just spread around like a bad case of an aerial disease.
2213268	2214128	They're all over now.
2214168	2215309	But in case you haven't heard them yet...
2216047	2217347	I'm going to play them for you right now.
2217788	2222709	And they're all really good, in my personal opinion.
2222729	2231192	They sound a lot like the stuff that came out of Beatmania 6 plus Core Remix, and a lot of the same artists are there, such as my favorite Pink Pong and Athletics and such.
2231712	2237314	A lot of the new songs I like a lot, but most Beatmania purists, I guess, aren't very fond of the way it is.
2237907	2238748	Well, we shall see.
2238868	2240369	Let's see what the chat room thinks of these.
2240389	2244412	I'm going to play three songs in this break from 2DX 8th Style.
2244433	2253080	We're going to hear, starting off, Tiger Yamato with V35, and then we're going to hear Mr. T with Airflow, and we'll hear Pink Pong with Star Dreams.
2253100	2254301	So I'm going to play those three for you.
2254321	2259105	We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back to talk about 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2328398	2328648	Thank you.
2383486	2384692	Thanks for watching!
2416082	2416444	Thank you.
2476121	2476862	Thanks for watching!
2600413	2605416	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
2606217	2610039	Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
2610519	2612440	Saturdays, 6.30 p.m.
2612900	2613461	to 9.30 p.m.
2613501	2617483	Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.
2619464	2623547	Baby, I got you, baby.
2625848	2626829	I got you, baby.
2637852	2643594	Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.
2646776	2649197	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2649677	2652178	Jamie doing a little reprise of the chicken there.
2654579	2656279	I think he just blew out somebody's speaker there.
2659020	2660921	It's a chicken getting raped, dude.
2662902	2663602	You just heard...
2664508	2669571	Three songs, brand new, just all over the internet like a wildfire this week.
2669692	2670472	They're shiny.
2670632	2671913	They're shiny, spankin' new.
2671953	2674055	We heard first, we heard Tiger Yamato with V35.
2674155	2675095	He's a spank.
2675295	2679378	Second was Mr. T with Airflow, and lastly, Pink Pong with Star Dream.
2679738	2686363	A little promo for that other show on Saturday nights, UnderSedationLive.org, a fun little program I've participated in.
2686383	2686803	It's special.
2686943	2689125	And Jamie participates in quite frequently lately.
2689145	2690626	Yeah, I'm the number one guest.
2690866	2693728	Last night was a very neat show because for the first time,
2694565	2704293	Travis played during one of the breaks a 2DX song, which is very scary if you know Travis because he really just thinks Bomani people are dorks, but in a good way.
2704753	2708536	Never Look Back, which is a cool song, because it's goth.
2710538	2711519	It is a cool song, I agree.
2711879	2715302	But that's a fun show, and if you like what we do here, you should definitely tune into that.
2715362	2716843	It's super fun.
2718364	2719986	I don't know how else to explain it, really.
2720867	2722448	Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...
2723513	2727734	Anyway, going back to 2DX8's style, what do y'all think of the music?
2727754	2729354	What do you think of Aderd's style so far?
2729834	2732555	It's special and shiny.
2733075	2739956	I'm sorry, but that one Tiger Yamato track freaking sounds like it's Taka.
2740336	2742156	You think maybe somebody messed up on the labeling?
2743917	2745797	I don't know, but it sounds like Taka.
2748678	2750218	They're probably all the same people.
2751015	2751655	They're all Nalki!
2751675	2752035	Well, yeah!
2752456	2761579	I mean, the one thing that surprised me, of course, about the list so far, and I do realize it's only a test location list, so obviously not everything that's going to be new to 8thStyle has been leaked to the internet yet.
2762159	2764420	No TAC yet, which is kind of surprising.
2764440	2765421	Which is a crime.
2765781	2769082	But we're just thinking he's taking a little summer vacation and he'll be back.
2772504	2773704	I made up a money funny.
2775865	2777406	That was a real D-Slapper.
2778166	2778466	Anyway.
2781841	2786804	No, no, no, no, no, there cannot be a 2DX without my man in it.
2786844	2801694	I'm being told that also, now I thought this was rumor, but it's being brought up again, Max 3 is supposedly location testing too, but from what I had heard, somebody actually that's in Japan that posts on some of the message boards locally went to the arcade that's supposedly location testing and didn't see it.
2802214	2810039	So I bet it's probably one of those cases where it's going to be really soon we're going to start hearing the Max 3 location tests if it's not already out, but we haven't heard anything yet.
2811217	2835010	But anyway, 2DX, 8style, location testing To me, it sounds very much like 5Key music And obviously that's a big duh, because they're both Beatmania And a lot of the 5Key artists, now that Beatmania the final is gone Don't really have a resource, so they're going to have to go to 2DX to put their songs in I think it kind of sounds a lot like the music in 6, plus core to me
2836556	2838617	Okay, well, way off topic here since you mentioned Max 3.
2840678	2846960	I heard actually that one of the songs, Crash, that's going to be on Max 3 is actually a heavy metal song, which is kind of cool.
2847401	2848301	That would be interesting.
2848761	2851062	But back to 8th Style, I mean, think about it.
2851282	2854824	It's just like a lot of the Keyboard Mania 4th Mix rumored thing.
2855124	2862707	A lot of those artists were saved and brought into 6th Style, like Frozen Ray and a bunch of other 6th Style songs that you know should have been Keyboard Mania but aren't.
2863567	2872133	Yeah, that was always kind of my thought, especially if you, uh, the one song, Deutz de Fatima by Osama Kubota is not Douche de Fatima, is that what you're calling it?
2872193	2872673	Is it really?
2872693	2875775	I thought it was Douche de, whatever it's called.
2875855	2877236	If it's really French, it's Dwatz.
2877256	2877897	It's Dwatz.
2878277	2878697	Dwatz?
2879338	2881259	It's like, uh, Dwatz de Fatima.
2881739	2882700	Dwatz de, whatever.
2883040	2884001	Whatever the hell it's called.
2884021	2885342	Y'all know what song I'm talking about by this one.
2885382	2886923	It's the one that goes, that song.
2889477	2893561	Does not sound like ever a 2DX song ever, but it sounds like Keyboard Mania to me.
2894101	2897224	The reason why I think it's French, by the way, is because that's French for right.
2899787	2901969	But Fatima is Portuguese and Latin for marry.
2901989	2902910	I figured out what it is.
2903991	2905052	I figured out what it is.
2905172	2910497	It's just a bunch of languages and they butchered them all and they stuck them in one together and fucking shit, cock, cunt, suck, fault.
2910577	2911138	Give me that.
2912192	2917878	Whatever happened to the actual licensed songs that they were talking about for 8th style, like Daft Punk and that kind of stuff?
2918439	2919880	Don't know.
2920201	2924265	Location tests don't usually have licensed songs in them, so we don't know.
2925658	2933685	But yeah, Team Guilo, before they went down, they rumored to put on Apex Twins' Girl Boy song as one of the test songs for 8th style.
2933725	2937068	And if that is true, then I would, like, die.
2937088	2938870	Because that's, like, one of the coolest songs ever.
2939170	2946196	I think they took somebody's, you know, little files for their home version and stuck it in the arcade to test it.
2946336	2948258	What, how they tested the 8th style?
2948298	2948959	How they got those MP3s?
2949059	2950840	I was joking.
2952589	2954930	I really have nothing to say about that.
2954950	2957532	Well then why did you take the microphone, honestly?
2979693	2981394	Because she knew you'd take it eventually.
2982254	2984035	Dude, he's such a mic whore.
2985376	2988658	We're going to have to get him a little headset like Matt had the first two weeks.
2988938	2990439	Well, thank you for calling Orange Lounge.
2990479	2991859	May you help me?
2994561	2997142	I'll just have to put you on hold until you can learn to speak in a more professional manner.
2998903	3000264	Yes, he worked in the call center for two years.
3003042	3004823	2DX8Style, what else did I want to say about it?
3004843	3005403	There was something.
3005423	3006523	It's special!
3006924	3008004	It's a special.
3008764	3009584	It's new!
3010024	3011405	It makes me tingle.
3012805	3013465	Down there?
3014166	3014406	No.
3015606	3016526	That's what the show's for.
3016546	3018187	Is it like dolphin blue?
3018807	3019627	Or head and shoulders?
3019687	3021328	It makes my scalp sparkle.
3022708	3027569	How about any other songs you guys liked for those of you that have heard all of the 8Style tracks to date?
3028590	3029930	Dancer's pretty fucking cool.
3030544	3030784	Yay!
3030824	3031505	Dancer rules!
3031865	3041093	Yeah, because it's like something you'd expect more in Guitar Freak's drum mania, but it kind of reminds me of Kiriyama Oka's Diamond Jealousy, which I really like.
3041713	3042234	So, yeah.
3042814	3043155	Way to go.
3044436	3045557	Yay!
3045617	3046277	Meltdown!
3046297	3046798	Meltdown!
3046818	3051922	Just a bunch more Eurobeat, because I thought the sixth style was 2DX Parapara edition.
3053250	3056312	I don't know if I should hit the keys or start waving my hands around.
3056532	3056712	Huh?
3056752	3056872	What?
3056892	3057593	You want this microphone?
3057713	3057873	Huh?
3058133	3058493	Huh, Sal?
3058553	3059454	Huh?
3060114	3061315	We have taunting going on.
3062836	3065537	The new Naoki song actually sounded really good.
3066018	3066358	I forget.
3066818	3067839	It's the one that's got...
3069003	3070243	It's not polytery!
3070403	3071564	And everybody cheers!
3072104	3073204	It's not polytery!
3090931	3094992	The song in the background, Youthful Urges, also known as Blue Impulse.
3095052	3096453	That is the Naoki.
3096693	3103715	For once, he ditched Politary and went with somebody named Yuki.
3103815	3104755	No!
3106475	3108796	I'm not starting the Politary debate again on this show.
3113117	3114998	As long as it's not Politary, I'm a happy girl.
3117158	3118499	I... What?
3118579	3118759	Yes?
3119562	3121123	I'm gonna choke on this microphone right now.
3142808	3146291	Whatever happened, weren't they supposed to get another chick for Dive?
3146952	3149454	Like, when DDR Max came out, you know how Dive has four people?
3149474	3151016	Weren't they going to get a fifth person?
3151756	3152697	Whatever happened with that?
3153598	3154439	Polite Jerry killed her.
3157301	3161405	I guess somebody realized, oh, I'm sorry, what the hell am I saying?
3161445	3162827	I'm sorry, a fifth girl for Dive.
3162887	3164268	I'm talking B for You, not Dive.
3164288	3165129	B for You sings Dive.
3165692	3166292	Be4U.
3166573	3169514	They were supposed to get a fifth chick in Be4U, and that didn't happen.
3170035	3174998	Politary scalped her, wore her scalp, and just, like, started singing Be4U songs.
3175138	3180241	I thought that one person had left, and they got a replacement, so that would make it to four again, right?
3180721	3184623	Yeah, I think that's actually what happened, but the thing is, I always thought that Naoki would just cross-dress and do it.
3185204	3185564	Yeah, yeah.
3185904	3187845	Because everybody thinks Naoki's a woman anyway.
3189486	3191207	I'm sorry, but Naoki's pretty good looking.
3191267	3191908	It is a woman.
3192128	3193589	Naoki is a very pretty man.
3193669	3193969	Naoki...
3194947	3196768	The Aoki is about as ambiguous as Gackt.
3196788	3197749	Let's put it that way.
3197989	3199429	Dude, he's pretty too.
3200170	3201010	I'm sorry, Gackt is funny.
3201030	3202331	Now, this is in the chat room.
3202371	3202811	Here's a line.
3204612	3208114	There's a line here.
3208294	3209995	According to Irene, he's Hodor-y.
3211494	3212495	Align here in the chatroom.
3212515	3213776	This would be a great Oni course.
3214236	3216478	Naoki not featuring Politary.
3217399	3217799	Yes.
3218340	3219801	That would be the best non-stop course ever.
3219821	3220161	Who said that?
3220181	3220602	Who said that?
3220702	3222463	That was DarkTetsuya, our friend.
3222563	3224645	I'm sorry, DT, you like our winner now.
3224865	3225546	Are you sorry?
3227727	3228448	Oh, I got an idea.
3228768	3229289	I got an idea.
3229369	3232051	How about the Politary course, not featuring Naoki?
3232331	3233332	It'll just be her singing.
3233612	3234513	No music, nothing.
3235133	3237255	God, then we can really tell how terrible she is.
3237275	3237375	I cry.
3237395	3238076	Player's worst.
3240131	3241371	I'm the first winner.
3241391	3242332	No, I mean loser, actually.
3255925	3256565	Thanks for watching!
3275816	3276176	Shut up!
3276576	3286102	Anyway, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, because we're seeing lots of people coming into the chatroom now, and you want to join the party, just go to Channel Orange Lounge.
3287343	3289644	Hey, Mr. DJ.
3289724	3290985	Anyway, sorry, inside joke.
3292005	3297148	If you want to join the Orange Lounge party, just join Channel Orange Lounge.
3297329	3298729	There's a party in my pants.
3298890	3299130	Anyway...
3304131	3308753	Any other side IRC server, it's listed on your MIRC list of servers.
3311094	3313396	Bongo is demanding to hear some Politary.
3314036	3315257	Bongo, shove it.
3317057	3318018	I love you, Bongo.
3318338	3319499	Bongo, we must marry.
3319519	3321299	I will allow you to date with me.
3324261	3326022	I have to go smite Brad now.
3327782	3328162	Pop!
3328402	3330604	Listen to Orange on Radio.
3330704	3334627	Because Bongo demands it.
3345976	3346796	Sorry, Bongo.
3346916	3349017	If you were a bouncer at Club Top Academy, you'd get laid.
3349137	3354059	Anyway, we're going into all sorts of inside jokes on this show, and people are just kind of probably looking at this going, train wreck.
3354119	3357260	Although, we kind of already have that reputation, I'm sure.
3357600	3359721	Well, we've got people listening, so apparently it's not that bad.
3360761	3361781	Oh, we just had one drop.
3362442	3364002	Hey, hey, pantsless rage.
3364022	3365023	3-2 Debbie.
3366203	3367363	We need ratings.
3367523	3368984	That only worked last week, dear.
3370384	3372225	Speaking of which, oh, that does make me think, though.
3372245	3373045	DDRPC.
3373646	3374826	I got to play it a little more.
3375902	3379284	and unlocked some new... We were talking last week about hacking the characters.
3379985	3383046	Anyway, some new characters that are unlocked in TDRPC.
3383106	3388190	There's a character called Brother, who's a... Shaft!
3389470	3390951	He pretty much... Shut your mouth!
3390971	3393753	He's a cross between Shaft and Jam Jam Reggae, pretty much.
3393773	3395314	The whole little reggae hat thing.
3395574	3396495	And his name's Brother.
3397515	3398136	He's a brother.
3398456	3398816	Brother.
3399496	3403659	And then the other unlockable characters are Ruby and Sapphire, which are...
3404441	3408663	Which is pretty much, they kind of look like... Aren't those Sailor Moon characters or something?
3408763	3409323	I'm not sure.
3409423	3409783	No.
3410223	3412644	But it looks like... I don't think there's a Ruby Moon in Cardi B or Sakura.
3413284	3415905	It kind of looks like a cowboy and a cowgirl.
3416025	3417626	Ruby and Sapphire is kind of what they look like.
3417646	3418226	Sapphire's a guy?
3418486	3418686	Yeah.
3418867	3419627	Sapphire's a boy.
3420127	3420627	It's Falky!
3420647	3421187	Oh my god.
3421708	3424929	And then one of the other unlockable characters is Pink-Haired Emmy.
3425109	3426830	Or, not Emmy, Pink-Haired Lady.
3427630	3427970	Lovely.
3429190	3430491	She's from Second Mix or something.
3432956	3440301	Oh, if you're in the chat room right now, SoCalKicks on his lovely little site at SoCalKicks.com has some articles with pictures if you want to go see.
3440701	3442903	I know that because I gave him the picture of Brother.
3444824	3445625	And Angel Zukin.
3445865	3451869	And actually speaking of SoCalKicks, I think it's about time for me to once again repeat the challenge.
3452690	3453630	Alright, go for it.
3454151	3454471	Why not?
3456067	3458569	Both of my edits can be found on his page, I hope still.
3458849	3463794	If not, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.
3463954	3465996	OrangeloungeRadio at yahoo.com.
3466036	3466556	All one word.
3468238	3475124	And I will get you the Dex files for it for my Look to the Sky edit called Free Fall.
3475264	3478847	The first person to send me proof... Excuse me, Mr. SoCalKicks.
3479847	3481148	Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner for you!
3505777	3509479	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3536243	3536543	Hello.
3537984	3538704	Did you hurt yourself?
3540605	3541446	I think we have an injury.
3542286	3543007	Do you need a band-aid?
3543027	3544307	Do you need some vodka?
3544347	3544748	What do you need?
3546909	3547469	I'm okay.
3547589	3548750	Alright, I'm okay.
3550351	3553712	SoCalKick, send me a private message with your email and I'll make sure Matt gets it.
3553853	3556014	Because Matt has an assload of edits.
3556034	3557555	There's really no other way to describe it.
3557575	3558935	He just has an assload of edits.
3559336	3562657	He's got like J-Lo's leftover ass of edits.
3562857	3565299	Everything they took off of Ricky Lake, he's got in edits.
3566972	3567872	I just killed the show.
3567892	3568633	That was funny.
3568813	3569193	Anyway.
3570733	3571494	That was wrong.
3571874	3573815	Anyway, why don't we take a break now?
3574555	3575535	Gee, break.
3577416	3578716	What did I say I was going to play this break?
3578756	3580377	Oh, I said I'd play Jack and Mark Get Busy.
3580777	3581037	Yes.
3582158	3584038	And let's do another 8-style song.
3584919	3589200	How about... No, I want to do... Let's do Rainbow.
3589240	3590321	Oh, we want to do the Naoki song?
3590361	3590661	Why not?
3591861	3592302	Why not?
3592542	3594702	We'll get that in there and some other crap.
3595303	3595923	So enjoy.
3595943	3596023	Yeah.
3597048	3598970	We'll take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3692311	3692914	Thanks for watching!
3743208	3744069	Thanks for watching!
3839267	3839788	Rokkata!
3839828	3840188	Toshiki!
3840208	3840588	Jojo!
3840608	3840948	Miyato!
3870165	3870647	The King!
3871770	3872171	JoJo!
3915402	3921329	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Dome's been-running music in more shows?
3921349	3928478	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
3928819	3930801	It's unearthly.
3931021	3934746	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.
3935310	3937331	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3955180	3957741	The chat room, they seem to think Lab's okay.
3957841	3959101	Don't really care for Dancer, though.
3959661	3961502	They disagree with Brad and Irene in that respect.
3961842	3964823	But Brad and Irene went home, so they are not here to defend themselves.
3964863	3966363	So I guess the chat room wins that one.
3966583	3967464	So I can say this.
3967724	3968924	Politary sucks!
3970625	3970985	I hate her!
3971005	3971565	Die, die, die!
3971605	3972225	Also, we're kind of...
3979059	3979319	Thank you.
3979339	3979600	Yay for pizza.
3990776	3993857	And this yay for pizza was brought to you by Propel Water, put out by Gatorade.
3993977	4001580	And I was going to let Matt give a sim update, but he left to go get pizza, so now I'm stuck with nothing.
4001600	4002640	We'll have to tell Potty Joke.
4002720	4004461	I will give the sim update.
4004481	4009523	The best way to kill sims is to put them in a pool and remove the ladder.
4010523	4011783	I'm being sent files.
4011843	4013284	I don't know if this is a good thing or not.
4013324	4014144	We'll find out here.
4014184	4016045	You can also teach sims how to barbecue.
4016915	4021796	and then if you give them a low personality rating, when they set themselves on fire, nobody will come to help them.
4022056	4025617	I would love to know what SoCalKick sent me this file for.
4025677	4028057	It's a picture of his cable provider or something.
4029178	4029858	Are they exploding?
4030478	4031238	No, not yet.
4032979	4033819	It says his picture.
4033899	4035379	Look at... Jeez.
4038040	4038360	I don't know.
4038400	4038660	Anyway.
4039380	4039780	It's a thingy.
4041132	4043454	You want to give any more shoutouts to any of your friends that are listening?
4043835	4045737	Um, hi people who are listening.
4046097	4048399	I see some new faces in the chatroom tonight, very cool.
4048960	4049921	I mean, we never have a look.
4050762	4051222	Hi people!
4052784	4056147	Hello people in the chatroom, you're so cute.
4057889	4058770	I just want to eat them all up.
4059590	4060371	Oh, wow, hey.
4060391	4061532	With some fava beans.
4061592	4062974	And a fine Chianti.
4063973	4064874	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4082996	4112382	So if you see a short girl wearing glasses come out of the Star Trek experience all fucked up That is the best place to get drunk in Vegas, by the way You'll know who had the Warp Core Breach You know you're a geek when That was, you know, sad but true, that was the first place I ever got really fucked up I love the Warp Core Breach The Star Trek experience on a Warp Core Breach Which for those that don't know It doesn't last, though For those that don't know, seven different kinds of Bacardi Sobe and Razzmatazz, all mixed in a fishbowl And some really freaking good juices mixed in with it, too And dry ice
4113186	4119150	So Jamie will not, unfortunately, be with us in a couple weeks, but we will somehow survive and the show will go on.
4119170	4121491	Who knows, maybe I'll be the one.
4122332	4126694	Matt's been dying to co-host a show, and I think he's been here every week since week one.
4126714	4127094	Why not?
4127135	4128515	We'll let Matt co-host a show for once.
4130877	4132058	Oh, Matt's back.
4132078	4133378	Hey, Matt, want to give us a sim update?
4133398	4133859	Are you too busy?
4133879	4135279	Let us finish chewing.
4136620	4137561	Swallow, Matt, swallow.
4139378	4139658	Uh-huh.
4139999	4140219	Uh-huh.
4140359	4140559	Okay.
4141040	4144784	Anyways, as of today, see, there's a new DWI that just came out.
4144824	4145925	I believe it's 2.01.
4147287	4148628	Supposedly fixed some stuff.
4149149	4152993	One thing they added is percentages on the score screen.
4153273	4157017	So if you hit the upper left button, I believe it should put up percentages.
4157477	4158539	And very...
4159758	4161319	I was getting kind of close there.
4161339	4162460	Now it can hold 2048, so...
4171443	4173645	And for those that don't believe him, I will vouch for this.
4173965	4176407	His sim has so many freaking songs in it.
4176487	4178688	It was damn near pushing that number, yes.
4179569	4182110	So that's pretty much what's going on there.
4182591	4189896	Another thing that's pretty cool is DDR Maniacs, I think I might have mentioned it last week, is doing the user submitted files now.
4190416	4195758	And one of the files that they have on there is Ooh La La from Dancing Stage 1-5, the beta, I believe.
4196298	4203881	And it was one of the original songs that was going to be on Dancing Stage Euromix that was actually going to have three arrows at one time on there.
4204181	4205102	Or four, I can't remember.
4205122	4206062	I haven't played it yet, but...
4206982	4211085	That was actually going to be one of the songs that was supposed to be on DDR a long time ago.
4211345	4211765	Interesting.
4212245	4213126	So look for that.
4213146	4213566	What happened?
4213586	4214907	It just didn't make it in DDR?
4215107	4215727	It just didn't make it.
4215747	4217228	There was three songs that got cut.
4218429	4221911	I believe there was one by Run DMC also, so they all got cut.
4222792	4223312	Interesting.
4223492	4230456	And Team Guilo is still down, very sad, and that also means that DDR PC Central is also down, or the Melting Pot.
4230816	4231877	A moment of silence, please.
4232918	4233178	Thank you.
4235649	4239691	and also Tourney Mix 2 on DDR East Coast Invasion.
4239731	4243033	You'll probably start seeing the files pretty soon because they said they're releasing them on the 15th.
4243113	4244314	So, probably this week.
4244974	4245654	Cool.
4245674	4246855	Well, the 15th is this week.
4247275	4247435	Yes.
4248216	4248836	That would make sense.
4249916	4250657	Alright, that's it.
4250977	4252658	Thank you for that lovely update on the sim scene.
4253911	4254711	Back to potty jokes.
4255351	4255632	Poop!
4256132	4256392	Anyway.
4256712	4257212	Oh, ass!
4258973	4270016	Somebody suggested a good idea in the chat room that maybe you want to beg and plead anybody that might be coming through Sacramento that's going to the big tournament in Concord this weekend, you know, about your situation.
4271397	4278199	Well, if anybody can give me a ride to Concord, hey, I'll pay for a gas lunch.
4279324	4279684	Hey, hey.
4280125	4286130	So if you don't think you're capable of getting that look to the sky edit done, you don't think you're ever going to combo that.
4287031	4289894	You're not going to get as nice of a lunch for the another edit.
4290254	4291855	The another edit's going to have a nice lunch.
4291875	4292676	Yes, the another edit.
4292836	4298421	If you don't think you're going to be able to full combo the another edit anytime soon, come get Jamie and take her to Concord, because she needs it.
4298702	4299222	She needs a ride.
4299242	4299923	I'll give you pizza.
4303285	4306926	The big tournament in Concord, we'll give a shout out to this, because DarkSound's our buddy.
4307506	4312088	And he's doing a little tourney, putting together one on Saturday in Concord.
4313008	4315389	Dollar Mendy's Summer Vacation, I believe it's called.
4316189	4318369	And it's sure to be exciting.
4318429	4319970	It's going to be the very first...
4320903	4322444	One, broadcast over the internet.
4322464	4324785	They're going to have a little streaming thing going on there.
4326046	4331089	If I recall the page correctly, it's tunak.floop.net.
4331609	4332310	I am not sure.
4332330	4333150	That's probably it.
4333170	4333911	That sounds like it to me.
4334631	4345637	But you can also, on the tournament's discussion thread, I'm sorry, not thread, but forum on DDR Freak, there is a link to the page and some feedback on what's going on.
4346158	4346318	Cool.
4347438	4349860	It has the best freestyle category ever.
4350260	4352282	Waste of two minutes of my life and I want it back.
4353142	4353442	Right on.
4353682	4356644	That would be the one I would enter if I were to enter freestyle.
4356664	4357585	You would have to bat.
4358245	4359226	Oh yeah, we should get the bats.
4360347	4362488	I'm taking the bat to bang people over the head with.
4362688	4363209	Thanks for watching!
4378058	4380961	We might be involved on another level, but I don't know yet.
4381121	4383663	We're still dotting our I's and crossing our T's on that.
4383703	4385625	We don't know yet.
4385825	4387706	Pay close attention to the station.
4388747	4390609	Pay close attention to our website the next few days.
4390649	4393191	You may find some interesting news, but I don't know yet.
4393231	4393571	We'll see.
4394212	4396254	We have to have our people call their people and all that stuff.
4399335	4405158	but we know for sure we'll at least be covering it because Jamie's going to be going to the tournament assuming she gets a ride and doing some interviews.
4405178	4406139	I'll get there one way or another.
4406539	4409861	She'll be doing her woman on the street interviews.
4412082	4412423	I'm sorry?
4412763	4413523	We'll have Bradley do interviews.
4413543	4414664	We should have Bradley do interviews.
4415288	4434136	I think my idea for Bradley because Bradley Bradley kind of gets the rep on the show for not talking much I think I would like Bradley to do the interviews like at Golfland with the people who just look really scary and don't do anything with Bomani I'd love to get a microphone in front of Bradley and make him interview those people that would be fun won't you think Bradley?
4436097	4444541	no comment fair enough Matt has something he wants to say after I'm done chewing here but anyways swallow Matt swallow
4447088	4448189	Okay, glad I got that down.
4448529	4457214	Anyways, Jamie, I hate to do this to myself since I've pushed it back three weeks now.
4457655	4458715	Damn Cusar trip.
4459115	4463638	I may be able to give you a ride down the concrete.
4463698	4470863	I'll go ahead and do that, maybe push it back another week or so, or just stick with this to seven, and we'll go then.
4471723	4472884	And I'll just give you a ride down there.
4474456	4477401	You officially get the My Hero of the Year award.
4477421	4478183	This one's for Matt.
4478203	4478824	This one's for Matt.
4480807	4481208	Here you go.
4484058	4485538	That just really gets my heart.
4487219	4490461	We're going to take another really quick break because I'm selfish and I have to pee.
4490942	4492303	So we take a break when I have to pee.
4492323	4494784	You should have gone before we left.
4495004	4496145	Unless I can just get up and go.
4496265	4497326	Go pee!
4497846	4498286	Alright, fine.
4498687	4500047	It's the Jamie show now.
4500127	4500488	Have fun.
4500888	4502649	I have both of the mics in my hand.
4504630	4507292	I'm going to give the microphone to the microphone whore.
4508001	4511384	Yeah, that'll probably make some weird echo if you're talking in both mics at once or not.
4512044	4515267	But, um... Someone wants to get fucked.
4516168	4517128	Who wants to get fucked?
4517909	4518830	I don't know, who wants to get fucked?
4518850	4520932	Someone in the chatroom wants to get fucked.
4520952	4521772	Uh, who's he talking about?
4521932	4524595	Um... Sukkot Kix, dude, who are you talking, who wants to get fucked?
4525235	4525936	I don't know, come on.
4526616	4527337	He just says yes.
4528174	4528935	You wanna get fucked?
4529535	4529835	Yay!
4529895	4531076	He wants to get some!
4534039	4534219	No.
4535240	4542246	Um, you know what, I think actually at this point, you know, perhaps it might be in our best interest to, uh... Take a break?
4542526	4546770	Go to break, but in the meantime, why don't you, uh, give your Bitmoney experience of the week?
4547270	4550072	My Bitmoney experience of... I PASSED A CATA, DAMMIT!
4550653	4556418	Yes, I did, finally, it's a real one, it's actual, it's not like burning the floor, which is like a fake cata, you know...
4557078	4558559	This one's actually Kakumei.
4559380	4560040	Burning the Floor is a 7.
4560661	4561801	It just jumped up to a kata.
4561841	4562682	You know it's not a kata.
4563222	4564043	We know it's not a kata.
4564103	4567565	But damn it, Kakumei shouldn't be a kata, but is a kata.
4567785	4569506	Alright, well, we're going to break right now.
4569807	4571688	Even though Rob has now finished peeing.
4571728	4573229	Too bad, it's my turn and we're going to break.
4573249	4576271	I believe Executive Decision is coming to play.
4576651	4577772	We'll be back after these.
4578607	4579868	This song or so.
4579888	4580568	What are we playing now?
4580588	4582949	This potty break is brought to you by Propel Water.
4583269	4584470	Fitness water from Gatorade.
4584710	4586071	Yeah, whatever.
4610724	4612825	It's time to scream it!
4612885	4615146	It's time to scream it!
4615226	4616727	It's time to scream it!
4616767	4617647	Put it on!
4617667	4618327	Put it on!

4874352	4875333	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4913141	4917264	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
4917484	4919186	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
4919226	4919626	No!
4922008	4923389	Do we trouble people finger-bush?
4923889	4925791	No!
4925811	4927252	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
4927712	4929974	Yes!
4931755	4933577	Extreme Babani Radio.
4933837	4936639	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
4937219	4938700	I say we let him go!
4939321	4939421	No!
4942233	4942933	Welcome back.
4943814	4944414	We're still here.
4944834	4945374	Hi, I'm back.
4946155	4946835	We've got pee-pee.
4947195	4948356	My bladder is empty, thank you.
4949596	4950677	Thank you for taking over the show there.
4951978	4954579	Now I know I can take a week off and leave the show in good hands.
4955539	4960061	We'll just have you in here.
4960641	4965884	We've got some fans in the chatroom who are sick of our old promos, who are threatening to make new ones.
4966525	4967146	Go for it.
4967606	4969368	We'd love to hear some fan-made promos.
4969408	4970269	I think that would be funny.
4970609	4973812	I just question, you know, if you're a fan of the show, let's get your voice on the station somehow.
4973892	4975514	It's everybody's show.
4976054	4977636	We want everybody to be a part of this show.
4977676	4979417	We don't have the call-in capabilities yet.
4980118	4981980	There's a party on our show and everyone's coming.
4982020	4987085	That's something we're looking for for the future is hopefully we can get some phone calls into the show.
4987125	4989147	But unfortunately that takes a kind of complex...
4990532	4991653	I don't know how that would go.
5005379	5005820	DarkSakura.com
5028183	5030225	Okay, the original version of Gentle Stress.
5030245	5032328	From 2DX, or... Yes, that's in our playlist.
5032648	5035231	Okay, then the AMD Sexual mix of Gentle Stress.
5035551	5036713	Give the mic back to Jamie now, please.
5039135	5039716	Wrong!
5041137	5042419	You win absolutely nothing!
5044012	5047815	Good suggestion from the chatroom, would an AOL Instant Messenger talk work?
5048376	5052039	I think actually it would, but not very well.
5052179	5054922	So I'm not sure if I want to try that just yet.
5055002	5058705	You might want to test it out with Yahoo Chat because you can't have multiple people.
5059085	5065651	Sometimes we do tests late at night when you guys aren't expecting it and we'll go live suddenly.
5065992	5069575	And pretty soon Jamie's going to be doing her own just spur-of-the-moment live shows.
5070598	5073179	Yep, I've been planning on playing non-stops in J-Rock.
5075400	5080942	I was going to say that Tech TV uses some sort of program for webcasting or something like that.
5081002	5084084	You might check in and see if they use the same program, see what they use.
5084304	5085884	You know, we need to get this show on television.
5085904	5086565	What do you guys think?
5087025	5087545	Yeah.
5088345	5090346	Let's write those people a letter to Tech TV.
5090446	5094008	What's that new station, G4 or whatever, all about video game talk?
5094568	5094908	Maybe.
5095428	5098910	Do you think Konami would ever let us do this show on there, though?
5100007	5103669	I have no idea if Konami even knows we exist.
5103829	5104390	I would doubt it.
5104470	5110173	But I would think, though, that if we did maybe something about all music games, which we pretty much do anyway.
5110213	5111714	We talk about all sorts of music games on the show.
5111734	5112514	We're all-encompassing.
5112694	5114655	It just happens to be Bomania's game right now.
5114675	5116336	When was the last time you talked about Pump It Up?
5118157	5119578	Well, let's talk about Pump It Up right now.
5120737	5122058	They have it at the Folsom Game Room.
5123038	5123238	What?
5123278	5124138	Not at Folsom Game Room.
5124158	5124679	Why did I say that?
5125079	5127340	I'm thinking of, you know, out in the boonies.
5127360	5130001	Are there any Pump It Up in Sacramento?
5130081	5130761	There's Florin Mall.
5131201	5131462	Really?
5131542	5132202	Where the hell is Florin Mall?
5132322	5132862	In the Tilt.
5133362	5134103	In the Ghetto Gate.
5134283	5134783	Yay.
5135123	5138665	Now, Florin Mall is in the Ghetto.
5139745	5142226	I was just there yesterday to get my booba.
5144207	5148949	Now, see, Pump It Up is a cool game that doesn't get much respect from people because it sucks.
5150004	5150825	And does it suck?
5151465	5152806	Well, I mean, it hurts to play.
5153106	5154767	You have to pound those damn keys.
5155168	5155708	Not really.
5156749	5159530	Okay, every Pump It Up machine I've played, you've had to pound all the keys.
5160091	5165314	Especially with their gimpy freeze arrows and that whole five arrow pad.
5165775	5170358	You know, it's almost like the Simpsons and Springfield and Shelbyville.
5170718	5176842	You know, everything that Pump It Up is is like utterly foreign and wrong in every way, shape, and form.
5177859	5178960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5197612	5198513	However, I don't know.
5198553	5201615	I just can't get as obsessive with it as I do with DDR.
5201856	5203737	I couldn't sit here for two hours and talk about it.
5203757	5206319	Well, of course, we're having a hard time as it is sitting here for two hours talking about DDR.
5206719	5208141	But Pump It Up, I don't know.
5208201	5210162	It's just... It's not the same.
5210182	5211063	It's not the same.
5211423	5216247	Well, what if they got rid of, say, I don't know, the Sumo and put in a Pump It Up machine?
5216387	5217008	I would play it.
5217488	5218069	It's just like...
5219207	5220567	To me, it's like Guitar Freaks.
5220607	5224909	I'm never going to be that good at it, and I'm not going to play it a whole hell of a lot, but it's fun to do once in a while.
5225109	5226949	Just don't leave it next to the Parapara machine.
5227509	5228290	Oh, that would suck.
5228610	5234411	But now, having a pump-it-up machine would be a good idea at RBGL, mainly because it's just, it's good to have, you know, change.
5234791	5246275	That's why I sat down and learned to play Drum Mania, that's why I learned to play Keyboard Mania, because it sucks to sit there and freaking wait ten years for your turn at DDR Max, because no one in their right mind is going to play USA, I mean, let's be real here.
5246295	5246335	Um...
5247776	5250981	But playing Pump It Up is at least, like, that's why I like San Jose Golf Club.
5251021	5257613	I can go play Pump It Up, I can go play Max, play Soul Calibur 2, and go back and forth between the three, right?
5258382	5270692	Well, you know what my secret hope was for the longest time is that they would take the neat cabinet with the widescreen monitor like Pump It Up has and do a DDR with that kind of setup.
5271773	5282061	Or like the HD monitors like 2DX has and have something look good, although it'd burn out and no one would ever want to replace it.
5282802	5290687	One other game they were bringing up in the chatroom a lot here is Technomotion, which I don't know much about, but apparently there is one up the road a little ways in Nevada.
5291668	5294590	I believe it's an 8 or 9 panel DDR.
5294610	5296571	9 panel DDR?
5296991	5300734	That's gotta be interesting, but I hear the song selection really, really, really, really sucks.
5301114	5303815	At least Pump has some cool songs in it, but... Yes, ma'am?
5305973	5308173	I think actually they have a website you can check out.
5308894	5312094	During the game, I believe you can switch between 4, 5, or 8 panel.
5312354	5313995	Unfortunately, there's no 9 panel.
5314615	5321776	But you can play that, and I think they've got some A-list stuff, like, well, one-hit wonder stuff, like, you know, Mambo No.
5321796	5324637	5, and I think Livin' La Vida Local, and that kind of crap.
5324857	5326577	Just to intervene, though, Mambo No.
5326597	5327838	5 on Mambo Will Go Go?
5328298	5328918	Fuckin' rules.
5330885	5336890	Oh, by the way, Rob, I was reading my EGM yesterday, and I saw something that I know you're going to love this, dude.
5337110	5340193	You remember that tambourine game you played at AI, Shakota Tambourine?
5340513	5341674	It's coming to home version.
5342481	5349044	That tambourine thing is by far and wide the gayest game I have ever played in my life, is that tambourine game.
5349064	5352486	Which is why I immediately thought of you when I saw it.
5352506	5354067	Stevie Nicks impersonation.
5354107	5355467	That is all I could do when I'm playing that game.
5355527	5357809	I'm just like, you know, like, Rhiannon.
5358029	5359509	And she's like shaking this tambourine.
5359549	5360330	And that doesn't date Rob.
5362091	5363051	I'm not that old, dammit.
5363371	5368414	I'm old compared to you, but I'm not, well, not you, but you is in the chatroom, people.
5369036	5373879	But Jamie and I are the elders of the Sakmavani group, I know.
5373899	5374620	Bite your tongue.
5376761	5380743	Oh yeah, that's right, Bradley's... We're like the... He's Grandpa!
5380763	5383625	We're like the den parents or something, I don't know.
5385706	5387568	Isn't that what you had in... Damn ornery kids.
5388228	5391190	Isn't that what you had in Cub Scouts, was the den mother and the den father?
5392128	5394589	We would have got away for it too if it wasn't for those pesky kids.
5394709	5397451	I don't know if I want to compare this group to Cub Scouts, but anyway.
5397811	5398991	We're not like the Cub Scouts.
5399011	5402593	But seriously, Shikoto Tambourine has got to be... Rob is right.
5402693	5404474	It is freaking fruity as hell.
5404494	5406095	You have to pose with that goddamn thing.
5406335	5407976	Win it in circles and shit.
5408036	5408916	Samba de Amigo.
5409036	5410577	But Samba's kind of cool.
5410597	5412238	You have to do the crotch pose when they're both...
5412298	5412758	Watch this.
5412878	5413338	Watch this.
5437984	5443757	My favorite part is when it shows you, like, the little pattern, and you have to, like, shake it in a U pattern, like, around.
5443797	5445962	It's like, ooh, we're going around the world with a tambourine.
5446042	5446123	It's...
5448345	5450246	They're making it for the home, though, don't you think?
5450266	5453067	No, it actually, I believe it comes out this month for PlayStation 2.
5453267	5455568	There's already a tambourine game called Tam Tam Paradise.
5455728	5458590	Yeah, but this is the actual one, though, that AI, it's Shakoto.
5459030	5467934	It's coming, and I believe it comes with a tambourine thing, and you actually do have to shake it in a weird fucked up pattern, and it's a really retarded looking game, honest to God.
5469134	5478159	It's funny, you know what though, it does have a little bit of connection to Bomani because one of my favorite Bomani songs, My Sweet Darling, for Max is in that tambourine game.
5478560	5481461	I know because that was the only song I played because I failed it!
5483122	5483883	Yay!
5484023	5485764	You want to know what game pisses me off though?
5486104	5489566	Actually, you know, I don't ever recall hearing a tambourine playing in the background of my seat.
5489626	5489966	You're done.
5493568	5496210	You know what game really pisses me off is Kraken DJ.
5497552	5505804	The one chance I actually sat down to play Kraken, well I more like stood up to play Kraken DJ was last November at AI and I absolutely failed it.
5506411	5508712	But I saw this guy at Anime Expo.
5510112	5514933	I go in, I'm still in costume, like in these 4-inch platforms for my Mad Hatter costume.
5515774	5520055	And there was this guy doing all this expert stuff on the Kraken DJ.
5520155	5524776	And my god, I was more impressed with that than I am at most 2DX players.
5525236	5527057	Because that just takes some speed there.
5527677	5531418	Just to scratch like that and hit the little trigger in the center.
5531438	5532218	That was freaking awesome.
5534211	5535611	Crackin' DJ is a very cool game.
5535651	5537132	I've played it and I enjoy it a lot.
5538312	5539452	There's not very many stages.
5539472	5541533	I was kind of hoping they'd do a Crackin' DJ Part 2.
5541753	5542533	There's one.
5542873	5543113	Is there?
5543333	5546234	That was the one that was at AX, if I recall correctly.
5546534	5547054	My bad.
5547574	5548375	I stand corrected.
5549615	5555496	Other Bomani, not Bomani games, but they're like Bomani, that they're talking about at the chat room.
5555977	5559057	The grandpa, possibly, of Bomani games, Parappa the Rapper.
5559898	5561338	Kick Punch, it's all in the rhyme.
5562034	5563456	My guitar is in my mind!
5577614	5579215	I'm sorry, the baby stage ruled.
5579275	5585197	And actually, the baby stage... The baby stage used to be in... I'm so excited, I threw my pen.
5585317	5587338	The baby stage used to be in Rotation Orange Lounge.
5587358	5589539	I think we took it out recently, though.
5590179	5592140	We try not to let that stuff go to death.
5592280	5593720	But we do have a Parappa stage in Rotation.
5593740	5595841	We're going to have some Parappa 2 music coming very soon.
5596922	5603825	Now, the cool part of Unjammer Lammy was when you got to play through the stages of Parappa, and you got to sit and listen to the remixes of the various songs.
5604565	5607346	But I don't think Parappa 2 had very good music at all, really.
5609882	5612563	I disagree because the Toasty Burger song was very cool.
5612623	5614064	We're actually going to hear that in the next break.
5614084	5615824	The best, though, was Sister Miss Asia.
5618305	5620406	I do not have the game Parappa 2, but I have the music.
5620886	5622767	I obtained the music through a special source.
5625088	5626388	Hook a brother up, yo.
5627388	5627809	We'll see.
5627849	5629969	We'll see what kind of a mic or you are the rest of the show.
5630389	5631930	Yeah.
5632770	5634011	Hey, I left for a little while there.
5634031	5635511	That was plenty of time for you, don't you think?
5636832	5637252	Anyway...
5637998	5641219	Another one of my personal favorite music games, Vibriven.
5644340	5645160	I love Vibriven.
5645200	5646300	It's so cool.
5646560	5647620	I don't know what else to say.
5648001	5649721	Vibriven is just the bomb.
5649761	5651441	We're going to play that during the next break.
5651722	5653142	We'll play a song from Vibriven for you.
5653542	5654742	You want to play a little bit right now?
5655122	5656103	I'll let you get turned up a little.
5658103	5661384	Yes, I have Vibriven.
5663104	5663505	Oh, I don't know.
5663545	5663925	I was done.
5663945	5664745	Vibriven's just cool.
5664785	5665085	That's all.
5665808	5667589	I'm sorry, the little rabbit is on crack.
5667629	5670311	If you want to have fun, you play Vibraban to a non-stop.
5671752	5672393	That's insane.
5672593	5676415	I sat down and I turned a non-stop into one track, right?
5676455	5680718	I burned it onto a CD, and I played Vibraban to, I think, the max non-stop.
5681199	5683600	It's the hardest goddamn thing I think I've ever done.
5683961	5687143	The announcer just screws up the game every time he talks.
5687543	5687843	Vib-Ribbon
5703417	5706440	And so you've got, like, playing Max 300 is just ass.
5707020	5707961	It's absolutely horrible.
5709402	5711884	Since the hosts seem to be busy, I'm just going to keep talking here for a second.
5712024	5712925	No, bad idea.
5713405	5726736	Well, you know, one thing that surprised me on Vibravin when we put in, this was before Max 2, we put in Max 300, and we thought it was going to be evil, but So Deep was worse.
5727697	5729098	So Deep was evil on Vibravin.
5731981	5743910	You know, there's a bunch of other music games, though, there's Samba de Amigo, I mean, what other game can you play the Burning Rangers theme song to, or the Opa Opa song from Fantasy Zone?
5744651	5745691	You know, that was awesome.
5746172	5751476	You know, I know that Samba de Amigo is sitting in the next room over, but I have yet to ever even see that game.
5753598	5760202	We will do a Samba Fest after the show, but I do have to throw everyone out pretty soon after the show because I have to drive over to the bay tonight.
5763264	5769827	And then there's, of course, the greatest game ever, Rez, which is just amazing techno music with a really gimpy shooter attached to it.
5770728	5773729	And, I don't know, Frequency, I heard that was a music game.
5773829	5774830	I've never actually played that one.
5775010	5776071	Frequency looks pretty cool.
5776091	5776851	Frequency's very cool.
5776891	5777912	I've played Frequency.
5778092	5778492	It's cool.
5779290	5781211	Space Channel 5 Part 2 is a very nice sequel.
5781251	5781551	It goes there.
5781571	5786813	Space Channel 5 Part 2 just takes everything that the first game went there with and then shoots past it by a few miles.
5786833	5787053	Pudding!
5803442	5804023	I love Pudding.
5804323	5809808	You know, the best thing was, you know, not many people like Puyo Da.
5810448	5811429	I love Puyo Da.
5812090	5814091	It was basically the Puyo Puyo dancing game.
5814252	5815793	Which we talked about earlier in the show, yes.
5816133	5818796	People don't like the music in it, but I absolutely love the music.
5818816	5819776	Some of it's very cool, I remember.
5819816	5820877	Cheesy J-pop, it's cool.
5821358	5822058	Cheesy fun.
5823179	5827163	Hmm, any other not-Bomani games we can think of?
5827723	5827944	Yes.
5829275	5833617	There's a pretty fun one on Saturn that's basically a Parappa clone called Jong Rhythm.
5834237	5835958	I saw there was a post on it on DDR Freak.
5835978	5837539	I wanted to respond to it, but never got to.
5838419	5839459	It's a fun, it's like a Parappa clone.
5839719	5840740	It basically is a Parappa clone.
5840760	5845662	You follow along, your teacher tells you something, and then you follow along.
5846311	5847151	That's really good music, too.
5847171	5852173	I wish I could find an album of it, because the last, the sixth stage song is really awesome.
5852193	5856674	Too bad, I need a perfect, I want to find a perfect version, because it's a really good song.
5857335	5858575	I wonder if it's on the internet somewhere.
5858595	5860996	That's not the game that's all audio, is it?
5861536	5867598	Because there was a Saturn game that I saw in San Francisco that has absolutely no graphics, it's all audio.
5868218	5870939	It's like the real sound game, something like that.
5870959	5871519	I think that's it.
5871800	5872980	And, like, you get seeds with it.
5874844	5877386	Now, how about the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video?
5880368	5882069	I know a place where you can get that in town.
5882109	5893275	I was looking at Sean Baby today because I was quite possibly bored out of my mind, and he was describing the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video thing, and it seems like the most retarded game ever known to man.
5893736	5896317	I mean, honest to God, that thing looks awful.
5897538	5902381	I got to play for a little, little bit once the C&C Music Factory Make Your Own Music Video game.
5902401	5902721	Oh, God.
5904222	5905784	I would love to be able to play that again.
5906164	5907626	Just like, you know, ten years later.
5907946	5909147	That would be awesome to play that.
5910989	5912711	God, dude, I can't even remember them.
5912731	5915835	They were so... That sounded like 1994 or something.
5915935	5918198	How can you forget C&C Music Factory?
5918258	5919960	You know what game was absolute ass though?
5920100	5921962	I actually did rent the Shice Girls game.
5923656	5924176	Shiza?
5926057	5927377	The Spice Girls game.
5927497	5928897	Oh, oh yes, I'm sorry, yes.
5929257	5931718	I have the... Dude, I have Spice World in the other room.
5932398	5933318	Don't get me started.
5934258	5936859	Anyway... I thought we've already covered the fact that you're gay.
5936979	5937679	Shut up!
5937939	5942160	The game was very, very much ass.
5942400	5946661	You know, I never played the MTV Music Generator games, although I heard that they were pretty neat.
5947201	5947761	Yeah, they're alright.
5947781	5948461	I got the computer one.
5949021	5952382	Now, if we want to talk about ass, we'll talk about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Magical Mall.
5953121	5955703	Anyway, that's not a music game.
5956063	5959946	The king of the top of those, though, will always be the Bust a Move series.
5960666	5962027	And I'm not meaning Puzzle Bobble.
5962127	5964008	I mean Bust a Move.
5964529	5965990	That's one of Jamie's pet peeves.
5966010	5968011	You're not allowed to refer to it as Bust a Groove.
5968551	5970153	Funny, I like Bust a Groove quite a bit.
5970453	5970673	You die!
5970693	5970853	You die!
5970873	5970913	Ow.
5970933	5971493	Now, this is interesting.
5977316	5979397	You play Spice World but deny Britney?
5982259	5986281	There's a difference between playing cheesy and then just looking at a slut.
5988502	5990403	There's a difference between five sluts and one slut, okay?
5991004	5991444	No, I'm sorry.
5991864	5993085	Four sluts and Mel C. What?
5993105	5994986	You mean they're not drag queens?
5995146	5997127	I'm not so sure about Ginger, but hey.
5998308	5999488	No, she said it herself.
5999508	6001910	She didn't want to be with the group because she didn't want to look like a drag queen.
6003695	6005637	and now she can be found.
6005757	6007018	It's Reign of Men in Max 2.
6010901	6014144	I guess we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
6014244	6018528	So in this break I'm going to play a couple songs from games that we've been referencing.
6018548	6023412	We'll start it off with a song from Pump It Up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6066315	6069517	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6121884	6143621	That's right, I'm in the house, here it comes, the extra, extra, feed all about it, the best burgers in town from all around, from around the world, come and get it, the line goes around like a merry-go-round, cause, uh-uh-uh, yes, you gotta, you gotta keep it.
6150831	6152592	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
6184583	6193550	I'll cook the patties Cook the patties Serve the drinks Serve the drinks And melt the cheese Melt the cheese French the fries French the fries
6221701	6223341	On the right, guys, we got no extra.
6223381	6225722	You watch the grill, control the flame, guys.
6225742	6228263	Follow through, stay productive, and guys, cook those burgers.
6228283	6228963	Cook those burgers.
6228983	6229923	Turn the party over.
6229943	6230784	Turn the party over.
6230804	6232264	Come on and watch them fries.
6232324	6233004	I'm not speaking.
6233024	6233924	Watch them fries.
6234104	6235445	Better execute than not.
6235465	6235745	Better.
6248533	6264583	Don't forget the cheese, don't forget the cheese Bring on the mustard, bring on the mustard Handle it with ease, handle it with ease Burgers, burgers, it's only half of mine We cook the best, best is in line Love with a dumb embrace, it's for you to know Any which way it tastes good, you know Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut the lettuce, don't forget the cheese
6276889	6284395	Yeah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.
6284535	6287137	Now go serve those burgers right now.
6287457	6289999	All right, I'm off to a good start.
6362709	6363820	Thanks for watching!
6445037	6446638	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
6446999	6451882	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
6452763	6458708	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
6459048	6460930	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
6461510	6465874	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
6466860	6469062	Yes, thank you Mel B. Give me a dollar.
6470163	6472065	Mel B. was here in the house a couple weeks ago.
6472185	6472806	It was a good show.
6472966	6473767	And Melody was here too.
6473787	6475949	Melody was here too, and hopefully they're going to be back.
6476229	6478332	We don't know when, but hopefully soon.
6480336	6480696	Vibraman
6511816	6514019	It's one of the original tracks that was on Viberbin.
6514559	6517523	I'm not sure if I actually have the file labeled right.
6517603	6518864	It is called Laughin' Beats.
6519585	6519805	Yes.
6519885	6522668	So, I don't know if that was the first or second stage or what, but whatever.
6523930	6525711	It's one of the original tracks from Viberbin.
6525732	6526292	Yes, very cool.
6526332	6530136	And a lot of people in the chatroom going, oh, that would be a very interesting song in DDR.
6530156	6532459	There'd be a lot of BPM changes they could...
6533656	6535037	Tempo changer out the ass.
6535057	6542025	Now, Loki sat here and did a Vibraban song on his sim, and it's got some absolutely ridiculous freaking tempo changes in there.
6542776	6544257	I'd like to correct Tal there.
6544397	6545839	I did not do that song.
6546359	6548581	I believe... I can't even remember who did it.
6548641	6551184	It was back... It was a BMS file somewhere.
6551384	6553986	And the same people did another Vib Ribbon song.
6554006	6557229	I believe it was... I don't even remember what it was called now.
6557449	6558590	Love and Peace or something like that.
6558811	6562714	Anyways, and the same people did this other song...
6563775	6564616	I can't remember what it was.
6564896	6565756	It was really awesome, though.
6566277	6568478	I think they also did, uh, what was it?
6568518	6570099	Just a little bit, whatever that song is.
6571020	6574142	Um, yeah, so, it wasn't me.
6574482	6576023	I don't really make that many songs.
6576949	6581671	But yeah, still, though, this thing sped up, slowed down at re- I mean, it does that in the game, too.
6581711	6583192	It really, really fucks with you.
6583592	6585753	I mean, the game will speed up and slow down.
6585773	6591735	I mean, it'll go with the song, but it'll still, you're not expecting it, and you guys need to play this game.
6591775	6592396	It's so good.
6592716	6594136	I can't wait till Mojiburbin comes out.
6594156	6599259	It's actually been re-released for, uh, the first one, though, has been re-released, I think, for PlayStation the Best, hasn't it?
6599619	6599799	Yes.
6600299	6600939	To my knowledge, yes.
6602360	6604081	Although, I have a nice original copy.
6605700	6607101	Yeah, I have an original copy, too.
6607441	6609402	Because piracy is bad.
6610022	6613244	Well, the original, though, isn't the best case.
6613905	6614685	It's backwards.
6615005	6619808	Yeah, but it's not that piracy is bad so much that we couldn't figure out for the lifeless how to copy the damn game.
6620228	6623590	And so, it only cost, I believe, 15 bucks off of NCSX.
6623910	6625551	So I went and bought it, like, that night.
6626652	6628352	Actually, all you gotta do is you load it up in Nero.
6628392	6631634	Anyway, um... You got it for 15 from NCSX?
6633556	6634676	They must have dropped the price.
6634897	6636017	When I bought mine, I bought mine for $40.
6636077	6636957	Wow.
6637157	6639078	I think it's $30 right now.
6640019	6640639	It wasn't $15.
6640719	6641079	I got it for $30.
6641179	6641979	I'm sorry.
6642800	6643180	Liar.
6643420	6644320	I paid $40 for mine.
6645981	6648062	A couple other topics before we close out the show.
6649371	6652512	Another road trip to Lodi How many animals did I walk out of there with?
6652532	6652672	Nine?
6672629	6673610	I had to get a bag.
6704112	6705853	So yeah, we might take this road on the show in the future.
6706133	6710954	Something they were talking about in the chat room earlier, I'm not sure if we've touched on this subject in an earlier show.
6710994	6715296	I seem to recall we might have discussed it, but favorite drink when playing Bomani games?
6715316	6716076	Have we talked about this?
6716516	6717376	Pocari Sweat.
6717897	6719057	Oh yeah, we did do this a couple weeks ago.
6719237	6720657	Although there are some new drinks out.
6720677	6722278	This Pepsi Blue, what do you think of that?
6722518	6724279	Has anybody had Pepsi Blue?
6724319	6727160	I have something like five or six bottles of Pepsi Blue in my fridge.
6727560	6728400	That stuff is...
6729020	6732024	Really, really good, but you can't really drink it.
6732144	6735888	You can't pound down a six-pack of it because you'll die of diabetes or something.
6736309	6741835	It looks like Windex, and it kind of tastes like strawberry soda and cotton candy.
6741855	6743677	I think it's the only way I can describe Pepsi Blue.
6743717	6745319	It's kind of a hybrid of the two of those.
6745339	6748643	I thought the fun of cotton candy was having it be dissolving and fluffy.
6748783	6749444	Crystal Pepsi was the shit.
6749724	6751205	I remember marching in Mardi Gras.
6767384	6767845	and Mobile.
6768545	6772149	Okay, everybody, I'm from the town that Mardi Gras originated in.
6772209	6773671	How many beads did you win that night?
6774051	6774632	Oh, God.
6775172	6778456	Cid Freak can just give them to us after the parade, but I digress.
6780138	6787305	They pulled out cases of Crystal Pepsi and said, they don't make this anymore, they gave it to us for free, drink it up.
6789884	6791707	Looks like Windex, tastes like you're sucking on Clorox wipes
6804964	6806585	Now, I take issue with that comment.
6806625	6809826	I mean, oh my god, Jamie's hawking up over here.
6810866	6812567	But no, I take issue with that comment.
6812587	6814127	I mean, it's a good soda.
6814267	6815488	It's just too sweet.
6815948	6818309	Drink one a day or something, maybe at most, you know.
6818689	6824391	But I like to do it, I mix it with my Indian green soda so it looks like this cool blue-green stuff and it tastes really sweet, but...
6824989	6829673	The ultra-saccharine nature of Pepsi Blue is a bit cut down a bit, and it tastes a whole lot better.
6829853	6831674	What about the people who are addicted to Ghetto Kool-Aid?
6831694	6832795	Do you think they'll have a problem with it?
6833035	6833235	No.
6833856	6835757	Because it does kind of taste like Ghetto Kool-Aid.
6837158	6839400	Pepsi Blue's kind of carbonated Ghetto Kool-Aid.
6839981	6844344	Although, I will say, though, out of all the new drinks out on the market, the winner is Vanilla Coke.
6844364	6844964	Vanilla Coke.
6845545	6848307	I utterly disagree, but that's because I've just never liked vanilla in Coke.
6848327	6850889	And you're just an ass, so... Just kidding.
6851329	6852030	We love Todd.
6852250	6852850	He is one big butt.
6852870	6855433	I can't believe that SoCalKick hasn't heard of Pepsi Crystal.
6855893	6858055	Where the hell have you been for the past ten years, bro?
6858335	6860216	Crystal Pepsi was on it.
6860256	6861577	When was Crystal Pepsi's out?
6861918	6862398	That's it.
6864059	6868023	I'm probably not going to use it, but I'm making a banner with a Crystal Pepsi can on it.
6868623	6873527	Crystal Pepsi era of growth was from something like 1993 up until about 1995 before it died.
6876440	6877740	Oh, we have a follow-up comment.
6878081	6879941	Hey, are you dissing Clorox wipes?
6880001	6881602	Have you even tried sucking on them?
6881722	6883342	Mmm, creamy Clorox goodness.
6883922	6888984	I've never heard Clorox described as creamy.
6889004	6891305	Your poo will smell lemon fresh.
6891685	6894445	No, we are not having any mint scattles reference.
6894626	6896326	But now we have, like, lemon scattles.
6898547	6900167	Feel the mint taste as rainbow.
6900187	6903128	Now, Coke, too, on the other hand, was the biggest pile of ass ever.
6903188	6904148	They still sell that in Britain.
6904168	6906009	New Coke is huge in Britain.
6907572	6911254	But then again, in Britain, you can also go into Burger King and buy a bean burger, okay?
6911334	6913875	So, they have no fucking taste.
6913895	6915075	Wasn't that just a tofu burger?
6916036	6916916	No, this is a burger.
6916956	6923219	It's got, like, you take fucking Taco Bell beans or something, and you lump it in between two buns with cheese and lettuce and all that shit.
6923499	6924480	It's called a bean burger.
6924520	6925640	It's a vegetarian thing.
6926000	6928461	Now, being the token vegetarian, I went and had one at the airport.
6928902	6932443	And, oh my god, I was crying for a goddamn tofu burger.
6932683	6933684	And I hate tofu.
6934784	6936165	They're so crazy.
6937269	6938650	Who will they think of next?
6938670	6939511	It's Marshall Beat!
6958234	6968723	We know that Frequency is online, but we also know that VibRibbon's sequel, Mojibribbon's online, which is really cool in that you take text files, run it through, and the little rabbit turns it into a custom-made rap.
6969023	6977690	It's like we used to do with our old voice reader things back in the old days of Windows 3.1 and shit, where you'd have the weird, funky voice read your little text messages.
6978738	6979799	I am the computer.
6979999	6981801	I'm going to say, Fook.
6983022	6986826	Fook you.
6987186	6991671	You look like shite.
6991831	6995234	There was the DOS program that was, this is my favorite one.
6995414	6999598	I was, I think in 8th grade, the psychologist.
7002088	7002949	and Dr. Sabato.
7025023	7026885	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7044130	7047871	I don't know if any of you ever saw that, but I do have a memory of that.
7047891	7049331	The Crystal Gravy was so funny.
7049851	7051411	Anyway, I guess you had to be there.
7051731	7058672	You know, that was back in the high period of Saturday Night Live, 93 to 94.
7059893	7061873	Back when I was like 12 or something.
7062353	7065854	Dude, I drank a gallon of Crystal Pepsi a day during school years, I think.
7066414	7068774	I started my senior year of high school in 93.
7069554	7070414	Don't make me feel bad.
7070434	7073295	We'll talk more about online games and all that stuff next week.
7073315	7073535	We will.
7074615	7076316	93?
7074995	7076316	I was in freaking 7th grade.
7076356	7077116	I graduated in 94.
7077916	7080437	No, 6th or 7th grade is when I got into 93.
7081297	7082017	Damn, you're old.
7082878	7083878	Bite my ass.
7085799	7087519	And on that note, I think we're going to end the show.
7088339	7090300	Any final notes other than fuck Tal?
7090340	7090540	What?
7092201	7094001	Yes, but fuck you next week.
7094041	7095982	Where's my music?
7096642	7097482	Oh, hold on.
7098363	7099183	We've got to find your music.
7099543	7101824	We played a lot of music tonight in the middle of the show.
7101844	7102784	I've got to find your music.
7103968	7104668	Here we go, I got it.
7105649	7109051	Thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you.
7111452	7112113	Well put, thank you.
7112913	7114154	All right, we're ending the show now.
7114494	7117496	Any final thoughts from the lovely Miss DarkSakura?
7119637	7120538	I'm a mic whore.
7121018	7121558	You are.
7121778	7122759	Yes, you are.
7123099	7124800	Anything you'd like to say, Matt?
7125140	7125340	No.
7125721	7126421	All right, Bradley?
7128712	7129153	Nope, it is.
7129854	7133341	On behalf of everybody here in the studio tonight, goodnight.
7135525	7135906	Whatever.
7137620	7143542	Listen to our Bomani Music and More program because we want to whore up our ratings and that's the best way to do it is when we have listeners.
7143582	7144602	So listen to us all the time.
7144822	7148023	When you're sleeping, just leave it on and let the music fill your dreams.
7148403	7149904	Oh God, I feel sorry.
7150504	7154125	You'll be dreaming about everything from... Let Orange Lounge violate you.
7154365	7160847	Dancing Pompokolin to Pachinko Love and Fear Factory is there.
7162199	7163161	Alright, the end.
7163883	7164243	Goodnight.
7164965	7166808	And next week we'll have our Kutimu impression.
7166829	7167690	I'll let go of it!
7167710	7168271	Shut up, Shiva.
7168292	7169053	Microphone whore.
7169093	7169334	Bye.
7170367	7173328	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7173888	7177028	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
7177688	7185230	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.
7185730	7189370	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
7189850	7198172	Well, son, a funny thing about regret is that it's better to regret something you have done than to regret something you haven't done.
7198852	7211364	And by the way, if you see your mom this weekend, be sure and tell her... Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
