46616	49378	Isn't it 4215, pussy wave?
49418	49998	You bitch!
50018	51979	Now let me check the zip code.
51999	53020	212, fuck you!
53040	54501	You have no morals, darling.
54581	58963	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.
59664	61305	Kiss my great news.
62025	64367	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.
64467	66748	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66788	67929	Me too!
68189	68669	Fucker, yeah?
68869	69850	I'm working on it.
70570	70970	Loser.
71151	71691	Lame!
72691	73612	I'm the size of my face.
74580	79083	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
79383	85167	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
85607	87549	I am your singing telegram.
91673	98759	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
99299	103542	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
103602	105704	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
106365	109927	Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
111068	114550	This is episode number seven for August 4th of 2002.
115251	120334	We are joined in studio once again by a whole buffet of guests, including two special out-of-towners tonight.
120374	122015	Say hello, everybody, to Jazz.
123315	123756	Hi.
124916	125777	And DDR Mike.
126918	128438	Hey, you fucking assholes.
129779	132501	Ooh, he's exercising his internet radio rights there.
134482	138064	And, of course, we're always joined by a bunch of our usual in-studio friends.
138124	139145	Say hello to Matt.
139165	139325	Matt.
140719	143581	Dave, and in the corner, Bradley.
144441	146523	You've got to be loud for once.
146763	147523	Get picked up there.
150606	156110	We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break and playing some requests that we've had the past few weeks.
157250	159632	Any other opening thoughts from Miss Sakura?
161053	164295	I don't have a specific thought.
164435	166117	And we'll get to why in a little bit later.
166757	169239	But first up, a pretty quick break.
201383	202825	Thank you for watching!
443038	444659	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
444979	449900	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
450581	456703	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
457023	458923	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
459504	463945	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

684775	685155	Sure!
694338	697986	The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball
704096	706697	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
706757	709619	That was the Swedish chef there promoting our little show.
710059	711940	Yes, Swedish chef can also be found on Google.
712380	714641	And we apologize for the feedback we're getting here tonight.
714681	717743	I don't know if it's because we're crammed in a little room and we've got a fan right near us.
717783	718644	Maybe we want to move the fan.
718684	721385	We might get a little less interference with what's going on.
721425	721705	I don't know.
721725	722365	We'll work on that.
722405	724587	So please pardon the hum in the background.
724607	728028	It adds character.
728829	729089	Yeah.
730535	739117	Anyway, so in that last segment we had, what, Papaya with Supergirl, and I tried to play Mr. T, Take Me Higher, but unfortunately the damn MP3 was corrupt.
739837	743398	So we threw in some Sister Mosesha from Parappa the Rapper Part 2.
744518	744818	Yep.
744878	745739	Very fun stage.
745879	746519	Yes.
746559	749440	Now you wanted to give that as a shout-out to some people?
750580	757982	Yes, there's some people who said they'd be listening tonight, so I'd like to say hi to Mary, to Ash, Michelle, and Phil.
758462	759182	So hi, people.
761286	763487	Does anybody else have a shoutout they'd like to give out while we're here?
764307	764788	Shoutout!
766669	772491	Yeah, so like, I hope all you conquered scrubs are listening to this, because... No!
773232	774032	Am I even talking?
774292	774912	Yes, we can hear you.
774932	775513	Oh, crap.
776533	777334	Okay, gotta go, bye.
779495	780615	Is this thing on?
780815	782776	Yes, it is on.
783096	784417	Testies, test, oh wait.
786189	790455	So, we are joined in studio tonight by some special out of town guests.
790475	793079	What brings you guys here to town this weekend?
793961	794602	We were bored.
795623	800872	Yes, if we sound a little bit out of it tonight and very unprepared for tonight's show, there is good reason for that.
801658	802339	I like scotch.
802399	804001	I like double shots of scotch very much.
804041	808366	If you count getting completely shit-faced as a little, then yeah.
824204	825425	Go ahead and keep talking, Jamie.
825465	826986	I'm trying to filter some things out here.
827186	827966	Oh, this pressure!
828026	828887	I can't take it!
829087	830188	Don't make me talk!
830288	830608	Hi!
831168	831548	Hi!
833870	837852	Seriously, the party last night was pretty, well, kind of insane.
838973	850020	There were a lot of people here, and it was basically, there was 2DX going on in the game room, and I wandered in there one time with Guitar Freaks going on,
851793	862281	And then there was also, you know, more drinking and quiche.
862301	864522	Yeah, you have to say that in the microphone so everybody can hear you.
868701	869521	Whatever you want.
869841	870482	We're on the air.
870542	871302	Say whatever you want.
871522	872182	Who's listening?
872402	872843	Everybody.
872923	873743	Who's everybody?
873883	876644	Um, people.
876664	876704	Hi.
876724	882146	Yeah, okay.
883446	884867	Obviously not a mic person.
884967	885387	Here, wait.
885427	885967	Try again.
886047	886467	Try again.
887128	887668	Hi, mic.
889669	890269	Yeah, okay.
890329	890769	I'm talking.
890809	891269	I'm talking.
891649	892790	Yeah, so anyway.
893670	894530	Hi, everybody.
894650	895091	How are you?
895191	895871	Somebody say hi.
897455	898416	The party was fun.
898696	901298	I had lots of people walking around the assembly room drunk.
901779	906223	People kept locking me out in the garage with my sim all night long.
906263	906883	Uh-huh.
907904	908925	Yeah, that was fun.
909866	911387	Hey, I hung out with you and I was drunk.
911467	920115	I got to do Drunk Drunk Revolution and I really wish that Wendell had been there because I owe him a match of Drunk Drunk Revolution back from Faname last year.
920315	922136	Well, we'll just have to invite him the next time.
923217	923698	Definitely.
924531	928341	Oh, we have a special message from the chat room for Mike from SoCalKicks.
928421	929383	He says, fuck you.
931027	931528	Thank you.
934013	934513	All right.
935294	936535	Special delivery there from our chat room.
936555	941679	And if you want to join in our chat room and join in the ever-interesting festivities tonight... Plug alert.
941699	941999	Plug alert.
942139	945581	Tonight will be an interesting show, I guarantee, because we're all kind of hungover.
945982	947022	I'm not hungover.
947042	948243	Dude, I'd never get hungover.
948263	949464	I'm not technically hungover.
949504	950925	I'm just... I'm emotionally hungover.
952066	952686	Aw.
953107	954648	Anyway... We don't have sad music, though.
954988	955148	No.
955168	961233	You know, the saddest thing in DDR I can think of to play is, like... Raid of Sorrow or Eversnow.
962173	962253	Or...
964644	966805	I could play like, how about ballad for you?
969006	973248	Do not ever play, there is one of the other songs that will never show up on our playlist.
974088	974468	Never.
975629	976089	I agree.
978410	981071	That was punctuated with a lovely noise.
981111	981811	Burp.
982151	984512	They're saying about the party saying Sky was stripped of his virginity.
992082	994025	About four years ago, bub.
994365	995087	Not last night.
995107	997330	Don't we normally pass that on the way to the Bay Area?
998131	998592	Shut up.
1000515	1002077	This is a Bimani-related show.
1002598	1003840	A B-Mani show.
1004501	1007505	Talking about Konami's famous B-Mani series.
1009326	1010107	Be money right on this show
1041328	1046653	Tell us about this outfit here.
1047754	1057423	Okay, well, I was playing Speed Demon, and for any of you who don't know what that game is, it's the most ridiculously easy way to win free tickets.
1057943	1059705	So I played it, and I spent about $2, won 500 tickets.
1059725	1060405	And then, so, me and my friend
1063588	1064949	Like, ooh, it's a hat thing.
1065329	1068451	So, it opened up into this big kind of lampshade.
1068491	1069732	It looks like a wicker lampshade.
1069912	1073194	Yeah, except that it's not completely round.
1073614	1075975	It looks like a Tiffany lamp, but without the knee glass.
1076456	1079818	Yeah, and it's not that great, but anyway, it's kind of cool.
1079918	1081038	And for 150 tickets, I bought two.
1081078	1082299	So I had 200 tickets left.
1083980	1087281	And then I saw the fans, which are made of crap.
1087441	1088462	The pretty little birds.
1088482	1090502	Craps with colors on them.
1090522	1091823	So, I took hate of them.
1092683	1095324	And then they gave me two extra, because they're nice.
1095424	1096384	I've got a harmonica.
1097125	1102367	And so, now I put it on, and I walk around and make a fool of myself.
1102427	1103707	I thought you did that anyway.
1104427	1106248	Yes, but now I can stay cool while doing it.
1107456	1107656	Ah, see.
1107696	1108136	Literally.
1108877	1112658	That's what I call an intelligent, ridiculous-looking fashion sense.
1112779	1115300	I wish I had the webcam stuff working, but I don't.
1115340	1116220	I'm still working on that.
1116500	1117741	I'll hopefully have that up soon.
1117981	1119682	Of course, I said that two weeks ago, so who knows.
1120942	1122663	That's soon in Rob's universe, by the way.
1122683	1122923	Yes.
1123123	1133868	If you want to join our chat room, visit any other side IRC server, like irc.egheads.org, and join Channel Orange Lounge.
1135041	1137945	and you can talk to us and participate live with the show.
1138165	1141910	Remember, that's Orange Lounge, not red or purple.
1142631	1145975	Like the band from 2DX where we stole the name, basically.
1146336	1149360	Anyway, let's talk to our guests.
1149460	1150521	Let's talk to our guests here.
1152395	1154456	Do you guys have anything that you're here to plug tonight?
1154476	1160058	Because usually when guests come on shows, they're here to plug something like their latest album or a TV show or a movie they're going to be in.
1160398	1166500	Do you guys have anything, tournaments or special appearances you're going to be making or websites or what?
1167361	1167541	No.
1168781	1170122	You're just here for the fuck of it, huh?
1170942	1171202	Yes.
1171222	1171282	Yes.
1171747	1173689	You're just here to say, I was on Orange Lounge.
1173749	1175051	I destroyed Orange Lounge.
1175471	1177053	Bingo!
1177533	1179635	He's here to watch anime porn with all of us.
1180236	1180596	Yes.
1181337	1182799	What was the coolest line?
1183520	1184100	Oh, I'll ask.
1184160	1185522	Oh, my baby!
1186853	1187654	It's not inside of me.
1187734	1188795	I don't want to be pregnant.
1188855	1190416	It's not my baby.
1191737	1192958	And what was the other one that we saw?
1194359	1196501	Oh, that one part where he's fantasizing about the chick.
1196521	1199043	Yeah, yeah, and then he sees the guy sucking his dick.
1199644	1199904	Oops.
1203827	1205408	Hence the warning for adult content.
1205468	1207049	Yeah, sorry about that.
1207730	1209111	How about you, Chaz?
1209131	1210532	Anything you want to promote?
1211113	1211893	Ghost Step Squad.
1213074	1213475	Okay.
1213555	1214535	Yes, Ghost Step Squad.
1214716	1214976	Thank you.
1217600	1218461	Go Dave Squad!
1220882	1222844	Team Sack making an appearance at Cesar.
1226106	1227147	Why did I grab the mic?
1227827	1229469	Because you were an attention whore.
1231130	1232811	I grab the mic all the time.
1233131	1233772	He's right next to me.
1233792	1234572	I have Rob's mic.
1234672	1235893	It's a big grab.
1236874	1238635	I can already tell where this show is going.
1239095	1245340	You know, maybe I ought to take the suggestion and just end the show when the Simpsons come on and we'll just fuck the show, let's watch the Simpsons.
1245360	1245500	No.
1245520	1245560	No.
1246414	1246934	We're on the radio.
1267348	1268469	New mirrors for that.
1268810	1274194	DWI, I guess version 2.0 beta 5 is finally out now.
1275255	1280600	Unfortunately, because I did play with the sim last night, I have 976 songs in there now.
1280620	1285084	The problem is you can't configure any of the keyboard or joystick options in there.
1285144	1290549	So basically I was stuck without being able to use my pads on it, which really disappointed me.
1290769	1292110	And the movies still don't work on it.
1293692	1306038	Step Mania 5 is supposed to be out pretty soon, or at least Beta 5 for that, so hopefully soon, because it said on DDR Mania X that it was already out, but I haven't seen it, and still waiting for that.
1307899	1319986	Other than that, Tourney Mix 2 is still on for August, so entering that, you'll see all the new songs come up around August 15th on DDR East Coast Invasion, so watch for that, I guess.
1320086	1321347	Do we still have time to enter that?
1322607	1323227	Yes we do.
1326909	1328969	Well this time around I will be entering.
1329590	1332391	I've already picked which song I'm going to be doing, which will be Outer Limits.
1332971	1336692	So look for that to be coming probably on August 15th.
1338773	1339093	Rad.
1340013	1343235	I would like to make a shout out to Ash who just entered the room.
1343515	1346036	I'm glad that you made it into the chat room.
1346196	1346756	Enjoy IRC.
1346776	1346976	Thank you.
1348570	1355804	Now, one errand that you guys are running today, kind of speaking about the PC simulations, you guys are running over to Fry's to pick up a copy of Dance Dance Revolution for the PC.
1357717	1358138	Yes, we did.
1358198	1361001	Yes, and you haven't even gotten to try it out yet.
1361161	1367067	No, I made a copy for myself and then didn't quite get a chance to.
1367267	1370951	I'll play it on one of the breaks and I'll be back with my brief review of it.
1371271	1374675	Okay, so during one of the breaks you can go run out there and install it and give us a review.
1374735	1375496	Oh, it's already installed.
1375516	1376197	I just gotta go play it.
1376277	1376597	Oh, okay.
1376897	1377778	We'll do that during one of the breaks.
1379921	1382563	So we'll talk a little bit more about DDR for the PC later.
1383204	1385767	What else in news going on in the Bomani world?
1386308	1386768	Oh, I know.
1387309	1390092	You guys were at that tournament that just happened over the weekend.
1390112	1390893	Well, not over the weekend.
1390913	1391473	It was during the week.
1391914	1392815	The Triple Threat.
1393135	1395057	What did you guys think about that?
1395137	1395978	Or you weren't there, Justin?
1396138	1396619	No, just Mike.
1396739	1399202	What did you think of the Triple Threat contest?
1399422	1400183	Give us a little summary.
1400783	1406592	Okay, yeah, for one thing, Mike Nose should know that he should never have a tournament on Thursday and Friday.
1407153	1415105	But he already knows that from the bitching that people have done, including Slip and Meow and all the other fucking flamers out there.
1416048	1418909	I wanted to go to that, and I couldn't because it was on the weekday.
1419210	1419790	That sucks.
1420130	1420991	Me too, I had to work.
1421031	1422871	You know, I'm just echoing everything everybody else says.
1422911	1423812	I had to work, I wanted to go.
1424212	1426773	Yeah, but anyway, it was a good tournament.
1427053	1429515	It was really new, something different.
1430035	1431035	There were three events.
1432456	1436278	We had the Survivor Series, which had teams competing against other teams.
1437138	1440220	A March Madness wannabe thing going on.
1441060	1458871	And we had the DDE Royal Rumble, which was pretty cool, but some of the things I didn't want to see, like Zero stripping in front of an Emphasis, or Mr. Windle almost eating Emphasis too, which was not a good thing to see.
1460271	1461712	I feel sorry for Emphasis.
1462953	1464194	Yes, as we all do.
1465654	1465995	Gee.
1467315	1468096	Anyway, um...
1469941	1475965	Yeah, like, Cory, he was bitching again because he lost.
1476565	1481468	But yeah, he has to get over it and deal with his loss, just like every other PA.
1481688	1482189	Who won?
1483049	1483870	For Royal Rumble...
1484744	1485304	Tigger Eugene
1500189	1501589	His brother, Ree, I believe.
1501929	1502450	I'm not sure.
1503290	1507331	And then he just lasted after that all the way up to the 28th person.
1507811	1508211	Jeez.
1508471	1513752	And then Emphasis, he got to come back again because he had tokens.
1514292	1519373	Because every time you beat three people or so many people, you gain an extra so-called life.
1519833	1520874	So you can make a comeback.
1521554	1527155	But Jimmy lost to him on Kakume, which sucked because he'd always practice that song a lot.
1529447	1543112	Um, March Madness, surprisingly, re-won, beating Eugene by two grades on, um, Waka Laka, Hidden Right on flat, I believe, which is pretty good.
1543572	1543912	Scary.
1544132	1544953	Yes, very scary.
1546553	1548414	Um, Survivor Series...
1549312	1553193	I talked too much shit, I thought my team was gonna win, we got knocked out first round.
1554053	1556413	But it was, yeah, it was really close.
1556613	1561214	I took out Ree, which is a good compliment to accomplish, because he always beats me at tournaments.
1561694	1561954	Yes!
1562114	1562954	Thank you all!
1563114	1563915	Thank you all!
1565475	1569475	Anyway, yeah, um, a lot of people came, it was a good tournament.
1570376	1573716	Hope to look forward to another one like that, just make sure it's on a weekend.
1574956	1577037	Um, as you all know, on the 17th...
1579892	1582558	Dark Sounds Tournament is going to be at Mountain Mike's in Concord.
1583279	1584602	Hopefully all of you will come to that.
1584783	1585484	Should be pretty fun.
1587805	1596529	I like the fourth bracket, this wasted two minutes of my life and I want it back.
1597029	1597269	Yes.
1597429	1598089	For freestyle.
1598109	1598870	Yes, of course.
1599690	1602391	That would so be my category if I ever actually entered freestyle.
1603252	1605473	Did you get a chance to see my drunken freestyle last night?
1606293	1610735	On Loki's sim I was dancing, he has Speedway in his sim with steps to it.
1610915	1614777	I didn't see it, however I think that might be an excuse to revive the bats.
1615720	1617321	You know what we ought to do?
1617661	1622224	Let's go to this tournament and just get fucking wasted and do a freestyle routine and see how we do.
1622244	1626507	Which for me, if I'm going to freestyle, is it going to be with bats or pom-poms?
1626527	1627208	We're of age.
1627368	1628048	It's acceptable.
1628149	1629650	If other people drive us, it's cool.
1629950	1633452	We're going to order a pitcher of beer at Mountain Mike's.
1635307	1639250	Well, I don't know if it would be against the rules if we could, you know, do the freestyle with the pitcher of beer.
1640451	1641392	I wouldn't want to spill my beer.
1641732	1642052	Yeah.
1642592	1643873	First off, that's alcohol abuse.
1643913	1646615	Second of all, that's a, you know, dance pad that we can't, like, get wet.
1647336	1651299	You know, at least from non-organic, well, I guess it is organic.
1651319	1655442	You know, it's bad enough we might get so drunk to the point of, like, accidentally urinating on the pads.
1655882	1656223	No.
1657363	1657604	No.
1658304	1660206	I may throw up, but I never pee on the pad.
1661246	1663388	No.
1663508	1664429	Rob, shut up!
1666562	1668723	I'm just thinking of the sound clips I'm going to get from this show.
1668763	1669983	You are not using that.
1670143	1670804	You are not.
1672405	1673705	I never pee on the dance pad.
1673745	1674225	Thank you.
1677247	1677587	Anyway.
1678468	1679268	Oh, other news.
1679368	1681609	Let's talk about... Yes, other news.
1681729	1682310	Other news.
1682390	1686232	Let's change the direction of this show.
1686352	1686912	Let's not.
1687412	1690054	Let's talk about 8th style.
1690194	1690794	2DX 8th style.
1690814	1691274	8th style.
1691434	1691834	8th style.
1693982	1698224	We've got some demo MP3s from 8thStyle, because it's on test location right now.
1698985	1702727	And so we're going to play some clips from some of the new songs.
1703427	1705468	Now has anybody else here heard these 8thStyle songs?
1705508	1705889	You've heard them?
1705909	1708130	No, assuming you haven't.
1708790	1709791	We'll see what you guys think of them.
1710531	1711512	I'll play some quick clips.
1711532	1715614	I'm not going to play the whole thing because they're kind of long, so we'll just kind of skip to the middle and see what we get.
1716354	1718856	This first song I'm going to play is Airflow by Mr. T.
1730905	1731766	I'm confused now.
1731846	1733747	I thought it was Mr. T and Motokai F or whatever.
1733827	1735028	Huh, I could be wrong.
1760185	1760826	Blue Impulse Yuki
1784288	1787530	I'm very decent.
1787570	1791492	Hooray, I'm happy he finally ditched Politary.
1791632	1795095	Well, you know, that's probably just their pet name.
1796276	1798297	If Brad was here, he would smack you right now.
1798437	1799258	Yeah, well, he's not.
1799378	1801419	That's his own damn fault for not showing up.
1801819	1803460	Fuck Politary!
1803480	1804461	Fuck Brad!
1804501	1804641	Yeah!
1804661	1805302	Right in the nose!
1806062	1807143	I hope he's not listening at home.
1808664	1812446	Because I'll be in trouble if that was.
1812506	1813247	Let's look at...
1814795	1817056	DJ Taka doing Rainbow Flyer.
1819938	1829824	Yeah, it sounds like I sense a lot of those little like triplet things that you see a lot in 2DX.
1829884	1832606	It's like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
1844795	1849881	Yeah, you have to remember, yeah, these MP3s are going to be crappy because people are recording them off the machine, literally.
1849921	1851542	Don't the machines, though, have audio in and out?
1851723	1852704	Why can't they just use that?
1853641	1859462	Well, because the people who own the arcade are testing the machine, might be kind of watching with an evil eye.
1859482	1862983	Especially if you have Konami representatives around the bit like, uh, what are you doing?
1864263	1869905	So, you know, give it time, because that's what they did with Max 2 and that kind of thing.
1869965	1870925	So, just give it time.
1871585	1872805	Somebody will leak the soundtrack eventually.
1873305	1876486	And the last one here, now this falls into a category called Cuddlecore.
1877347	1878128	Sounds good to me!
1878148	1878228	Mhm.
1904862	1905764	Sounds kind of mellow.
1905864	1908428	I know, you can hear all the conversation.
1908688	1910511	Does it get interesting by the end?
1910531	1912715	This kind of sounds like a carnival song.
1920373	1921094	Orange Lounge
1947348	1952991	I'm saying in the chat room, I farted better quality sounds than this in response to the Cuddle Corps song.
1953011	1954612	That was from Pyro Man.
1956413	1961136	And that would be an interesting 2DX song, kind of like in the Kitty.
1961156	1962117	You remember the Kitty song?
1962277	1962457	Yes.
1962477	1963578	Theme of Oopa.
1963618	1963878	Yes, that's...
1971733	1974395	Well, you know, that song was very interesting.
1974495	1977836	It made it onto Beatmania Pocket for Wonderswan.
1978557	1982979	And that actually is a really good version of Beatmania.
1983079	1992485	I mean, if you have to have it with you and you have a Wonderswan, it came with a little scratch pad that hooks over to the right side of the system.
1992985	1995726	And all of the music, it only had ten songs in it, but they were all digitized.
1996087	1999809	So you didn't get, you know, crappy MIDI like with the DDRGB series.
2004796	2008417	And of course, also still popular in the 2DX world, Sixth Style for the home.
2008637	2013719	Still pretty much new, and lots of people getting that, and more and more people playing it.
2014139	2020281	Speaking of the Game Boy versions of the Bumani games, you can actually get those at BumaniStyle.com.
2020341	2021481	Hey, hey, hey!
2021501	2022241	They've got them there.
2023642	2024322	Free plug!
2024422	2025062	Yeah, free plug.
2025803	2027203	Or you can do what I did and go buy them.
2029778	2032181	There's the right way and the wrong way.
2032241	2033202	You know, that's like so 2000.
2033423	2036086	You know what?
2036607	2040071	I have it on my Game Boy, and I can take it with me, whereas I can't take my whole computer with me.
2041513	2042955	My bio is a little heavy, thank you.
2043876	2045378	And it won't fit into my purse!
2047924	2053269	Okay, we're going to go to a quick break here and we're going to test out DDRPC.
2053469	2057512	Some people are running out to go play that because we just got it here, a copy of it in the house.
2058153	2068141	And we're going to take a quick break and we'll come back with our initial thoughts on DDRPC, some interesting news involving DDRPC that could be an indication of where U.S.
2068161	2068962	Bomani is headed.
2069702	2073245	And also tonight we've got FU of the Week, pretty lengthy this week.
2073265	2073345	Yes.
2076250	2079299	We also are doing another additional list list tonight, so stay tuned for that.
2079861	2080844	We'll be right back.
2278411	2279154	Thanks for watching!
2306518	2307504	Let it rain, let it fly.
2410339	2411640	Bitch, get a new song!
2435217	2437718	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
2438398	2441900	I think that was like the very first promo that I ever made for the station.
2441960	2442540	I'm not sure.
2442580	2444441	I remember coming up with that in your car.
2445081	2445521	You did.
2446001	2447742	The one-hit wonder one?
2448262	2449443	No, not the one-hit wonder one.
2449463	2450583	I'm talking about the Jogle one.
2450623	2451204	Oh, the Jogle one?
2451244	2455085	Because we were listening to one of your Dance Mania compilations.
2455105	2455585	That's right.
2456566	2460687	And we started... It was playing Bye Bye Baby.
2460847	2462068	That wasn't nice, Drew.
2463607	2465429	But she needs a new song.
2465489	2466830	I mean, let's face it.
2466910	2467971	I mean, they're all the same.
2468111	2470873	The song was playing and I was in the back seat singing Damdaryam.
2472675	2481902	And that's like how Matt, who's out in the garage right now with DDRPC, playing, he has an edit for Bye Bye Baby Balloon that's basically just the steps to Damdaryam.
2482603	2485986	And it works for like the first half of the song, but then it kind of gets out of sync.
2486026	2487967	Like there's an extra beat or something that throws it all off.
2488047	2489689	But it works scary well.
2490575	2494556	So as I mentioned, they're out in the garage right now playing DDRPC.
2494836	2496696	Are you sure they're not watching the anime porn again?
2496756	2498597	They could be by this point as soon as I left.
2498697	2503058	But when I went out there, they were watching the DDRPC.
2504398	2508639	Whole new interface, which I've got to say is weird.
2508919	2511319	I mean, it's kind of like 4th Mix.
2512319	2512859	But not.
2513000	2513480	But not.
2514460	2515260	How do I explain this?
2515900	2519321	Imagine if on 4th Mix you could go...
2521014	2521754	and many more.
2543200	2550468	Now, one thing I noticed right away, the characters are based off some kind of new engine because they're really high resolution, they look really good, the characters.
2550769	2554413	Which is probably why the new hidden characters are such a big deal.
2555714	2563638	One of the big news that came up this week is that they've released the very first downloadable characters for DDRPC.
2564558	2566339	I believe Zack and Alex are the names.
2567259	2570381	And they're not based off any other previous DDR characters.
2570421	2572101	They're brand spanking new.
2572382	2573102	Yay for America.
2573302	2575123	Yay, we get something special.
2575763	2580025	We get an Earthlight mix and an AMT3P mix and now we get...
2581149	2583070	That makes me spell a patriotic rhyme.
2585431	2587572	I'm feeling it in the cockles of my heart.
2588292	2594175	And basically the game is mostly based off a fourth mix engine, although it is a little smoother.
2594355	2598557	I'd say it's a lot, the arrows seem to run a little smoother, kind of like fifth mix smooth.
2599073	2600493	I was going to look, and they turned it off.
2600574	2601214	Oh, they turned it off?
2601234	2601854	How mean of them.
2601874	2603815	You didn't get to see the interface thing?
2604235	2614718	It's, well, I mean, again, since it's based off of 4th Mixed Engine, it looks very similar, except you kind of could just pick any category you want, and then the songs are in a circle, as opposed to across the bottom.
2614738	2615619	It's kind of interesting.
2615639	2616899	It's circly, huh?
2616919	2617920	Yes, circles are good.
2619200	2620300	Circles are round.
2620580	2624862	And then I'm also, I'm also being told not to forget Angel Zuken, as opposed to Devil Zuken.
2626246	2626746	Now you got Angel.
2626766	2629728	Why can't we have, you know, Purgatorial Zuken or something?
2630409	2633711	You know, where it's just, you know, kind of boring and just stands there.
2635672	2637253	Japs got Zuken, I mean.
2638394	2645278	You know, since there's like two players, can't they like bend down and shit on their face and everything?
2646119	2649941	And yell out in- I'M CHINESE, OH!
2653348	2655109	So this is our clip for the movie.
2655189	2656109	How about topless?
2656249	2657530	How about topless?
2659150	2660571	They should have, like, boyzookin.
2661031	2661551	I bet you anything.
2661751	2663612	How long do you think it's... But would they bounce?
2664832	2664972	Oh.
2666773	2668814	In the chatroom, they're hoping for a shirtless Emmy.
2669674	2669894	No.
2671435	2673075	Then I get pamphlet rage.
2677597	2678877	How long do you think it's going to take?
2678897	2679858	Do you think he's going to bounce?
2680078	2680798	If somebody...
2682862	2685783	Jesus, bro.
2686343	2699711	If somebody went and hacked Tomb Raider so that you could play a nude Lara Croft with big old jugs and, you know, how long is it going to take before somebody hacks DDRPC so you can play Topless Zukin, Shirtless Enemy, Pantsless Rage?
2699731	2704213	So what, then merge the first dead or alive with DDR and have, like, Bounce Bounce Revolution?
2706034	2707735	You know, Bounce with B-Bounce Revolution.
2709005	2713410	Since now you can play DDR at home in the nude, play along with our characters in the nude!
2715673	2718055	You know, I bet they're gonna have skins you can make for that, though.
2718075	2718936	That would be awesome.
2719837	2720518	New skins.
2722300	2722820	Ooh, baby.
2723101	2726785	You know, it's gonna turn into this whole big, you know, fad like what happened with The Sims.
2727560	2733483	You know, where you can have, you know, Wolverine and, um, who else, somebody random.
2734044	2738826	Like, I don't know, Galacticus, you know, hanging out, doing husband-wifey things.
2743008	2752774	And we have the return of... A very observant fellow in the chatroom says, now I can't confirm this, maybe Jamie can, but you can see Rage's ball line in third mix.
2754588	2758031	You know, I never bothered to check, but maybe I will.
2758051	2759232	That was Pyromancer then.
2759813	2760433	You're a moron.
2762575	2764117	So we have nuts in DDR.
2766559	2768060	Let's just not talk about people to play.
2768901	2769722	Matt's back joining us.
2769742	2772885	What were your first impressions of DDR PC being a sim fan?
2773641	2775484	Okay, let's start with the interface.
2775984	2777026	What the hell were they thinking?
2777947	2781672	It's 4th Mix, but... It's the most retarded interface I've ever seen.
2781972	2788300	Okay, but I'll give it a little credit, because 4th Mix needed that, where you can go back and forth between the categories.
2788801	2789162	It just...
2789902	2791243	It looks kinda dumb.
2791644	2794866	I mean, but the idea's good, it just looks dumb.
2795066	2810437	It's like if you took the banners from 4th Mix and stuck it on the little CD rotation thing that they have in all music mode, you would get what you have there, which looks like a bunch of banners hanging from a spindle thing, like some sort of like sunglass case type thing that you would see in a store.
2810877	2815321	It's the most fucking retarded thing, and they only have like 8 songs in each thing, so even if it was like 4th Mix...
2816061	2823387	Which you gotta admit has about like at least 20 or so in each category I mean, why the hell are they doing that with the interface?
2823427	2840901	It just looks like crap So that's fine, you know, it looks like crap The textures as far as the characters go, really good, looks nice Yeah, the characters look nice, that's the first thing I said too Backgrounds, who really cares, no one watches the backgrounds But they look nice too Did you see any Lego people yet?
2842029	2843189	That's the best background with Lego people.
2843229	2844510	Well, no, I didn't.
2844590	2850572	But what I did like, though, is the fact that you can customize with buttons and stuff for the controllers and that kind of thing.
2850612	2853413	Because the way I have my pads wired, they're really fucked up.
2853433	2858394	So if it was set to how a pad was, it wouldn't work.
2858554	2860355	So I'm glad they have that, at least.
2863156	2866417	Meanwhile, we have Michael here with a yo-yo stuck in his eye.
2867225	2868726	Hyroman sent me a picture.
2868886	2870668	Shall we take a vote on whether to open it or not?
2870728	2872589	It is entitled Rage.gif.
2873350	2874811	So you can bet you know what it is.
2875071	2875972	Bald!
2876052	2876432	All right.
2876753	2878374	So we all vote yes, we're going to open it.
2878414	2881156	That's what I'm going to do with these files sent to me during the show.
2881196	2883358	Now, we're just going to vote if we're going to waste our time with it or not.
2883998	2885680	All right, we voted to waste our time with it.
2885700	2886120	Here we go.
2889603	2890984	It's just a picture of Rage.
2891024	2896088	I mean, is that supposed to be that the shadowing there is supposed to be like balls?
2898200	2900342	Unless he's got some really huge testicles.
2900422	2901623	I don't know.
2903204	2904445	You know what Breach Pat likes.
2904485	2906667	Is that supposed to be the peenie right there?
2907368	2910070	If so, that's not impressive.
2910310	2914134	I expected better from Rache.
2914194	2918357	But keep in mind, you know, Rache goes everywhere.
2918858	2920900	Well, maybe that's why he's called Rache.
2920920	2923862	He's very angry over the fact he has a small penis.
2924823	2925844	I've never thought about that.
2927190	2929192	Hooray, this show's resorted to dick jokes.
2929232	2929652	Yay!
2930153	2936358	Oh, no, no, it's like that one joke where it goes into get laid at a brothel.
2936378	2937939	Wait, wait, wait.
2937959	2938539	Okay, you know what?
2938820	2940021	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2940341	2941302	I think it's doctored.
2941662	2942122	I don't know.
2942142	2943203	Like that?
2944664	2945645	It's very scary.
2946366	2946946	I don't know, though.
2947206	2949568	Maybe not, because the shadowing looks right.
2949648	2950569	I mean, I guess it's a real thing.
2950910	2952791	You know, Robbie, you kind of look like a woman there.
2952811	2953972	Yeah, it's a woman.
2953992	2954252	It's a woman.
2954272	2955353	It's a woman.
2957529	2959192	So Rage has a vagina.
2960715	2961436	Chicks with dicks.
2964039	2968862	So basically the Baxteran rage could make it in the porn industry because of one small defect.
2968962	2972184	So he's turned to DDR to fan out his frustrations.
2972264	2975125	No, it's like the joke of the man who went into the brothel.
2975766	2983110	He goes in and this one woman comes running out of the room laughing hysterically, says his dick's had tiny on it.
2983650	2988753	And so another one goes in and she comes running out screaming, I can't do it, his dick says tiny on it.
2989344	2992312	So another one goes in, and she actually has a little bit more patience.
2992693	2995359	She comes out hours later, and...
2996224	2997665	The other goes, so you could do it?
2998185	2999926	How could you do it?
2999946	3006169	He's like, once you got that thing going, it said, Tiny's Bar and Grill, 5734 5th Street, New York, New York.
3008150	3018715	That old joke, I know, but... But see, that's why he has the rage, because nobody will give him a chance when he's in town or something like that.
3019615	3020296	That sucked!
3021826	3033270	Now there's talk in the chat room, and if you want to join our insane people in the chat room, you're just going to head over to any other side IRC server, like irc.acheheads.org, and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
3033970	3037911	And they're talking right now, they're wondering if, well, they've got one more dick joke there.
3038212	3042693	If Afro's hung like a horse, they're going to look into that, maybe get some more pictures.
3042713	3044013	He gets in the contest with Dread Snake.
3045154	3047295	I think Dread Snake has a beat, the name says so.
3048695	3051136	I don't know, man, you've got those robots in there, too, I mean...
3053080	3054321	Who knows of that kind of stuff?
3054341	3056882	I mean, really, anything's possible there.
3058384	3060165	They have all those attachments, don't they?
3062387	3068591	And now we've really, really gone into the adult content, so I think maybe we need to... No, no break.
3068631	3069512	We're going to talk characters more.
3069532	3072674	No, you people need to get out of the gutter because you're all stepping on me, so go away.
3074375	3076097	Now these new characters are going to be coming out.
3076197	3076297	No.
3082111	3083292	Jamie's thinking about Dick.
3083593	3086095	They're coming out.
3088498	3093143	So what kind of characters do you think will be seen with these new Konami originals?
3093303	3098509	One thing I suggested on a post like this in DDR Freak, of all places, was...
3099531	3101112	I'm sorry, I have one suggestion.
3101132	3101793	You know Naoki's in DDR?
3101813	3105776	They should put Mr. T in there and have him look like Mr. T. He's like, I pity the fool who don't pay me.
3126761	3127482	What are you guys talking?
3128402	3128883	Oh, anything?
3128903	3129243	Gossiping.
3129783	3130104	Gossip?
3130144	3131164	Oh, well, come on!
3131224	3132185	Make it gossip on air!
3132225	3132866	Come on, come on!
3133186	3135928	Didn't the KOA guy get fired or something?
3136929	3138130	No, I think that's just rumor.
3138970	3143453	Hey, everybody!
3143554	3144094	Okay.
3145455	3149218	Anyways, they'll probably have, like, maybe some of the other Monty characters in there and that kind of thing.
3149618	3155302	The stupid little rabbits and... No, Pikachu's a Nintendo character.
3155322	3156103	I don't think he's gonna show up.
3156812	3158253	Pikachu needs to die.
3158514	3160836	They need to get those guys from Contra in there.
3161376	3161577	Oh yeah.
3162357	3166221	See, I have this secret little plan that I'm going to take over.
3167962	3170445	Well, that's right, there was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3171204	3175746	That would be awesome to have the turtles dancing, if the sea hasn't split their dancing.
3176426	3185629	But no, no, I have this plot going on that when I go to Tokyo next year, I'm going to take over Toei and have the rights to Digimon be my own, so we'll have Digimon and DDR, because I'm also going to take over Konami next.
3186550	3186990	With a tank.
3188760	3194786	Well, we do know that the last unlockable character is going to have to be something very interesting because most of them have a partner.
3194806	3195386	Kid Dracula!
3195406	3197648	But the very last one is Solo.
3197889	3198829	Kid Dracula.
3199210	3200010	Kid Dracula.
3200471	3207497	So, I'm being told that anything is possible and things that you might be thinking are rumors very well could be true.
3207577	3208739	That's all I can say.
3210060	3214404	It's going to be the guy from the Mike's Hard Lemonade commercial with the crazy head growing out of his shoulder.
3215660	3217661	See, he's got his twin, but it's only one person.
3218021	3218681	That's what it is.
3219461	3220101	I'm telling you, man.
3220821	3222702	I've heard inside information, okay?
3224302	3226823	What about, like, what about, like, three-titted Emmy?
3227543	3233684	I think this, though, would make a... Honestly, Rob, I think this would make a good future list list, honestly.
3233824	3236345	Or they'll have, like, sex slave Zukin in there.
3237365	3238846	No sex slave Zukin.
3238906	3240446	We need no pants rage.
3240846	3241706	Bonded jealous.
3243227	3243807	Guys!
3244878	3245639	No, no, no, no.
3246039	3251043	If you can have Bondage, Alice, and Three-Tint Emmy, then I get, you know, no pants range.
3252844	3257447	Well, then you gotta have, you know, that Dredd guy, you know, Dredd's everywhere, right?
3258528	3259329	Yeah, okay, anyway.
3259369	3260309	Cousin Hitler Dredd's.
3260689	3267795	Oh, now that's a good suggestion I'm reading in the chat room, that the last character should be a Moi head, or Maui, I can't even say that word.
3267815	3268555	Oh, Moi head.
3268575	3269216	Moi, thank you.
3269576	3272218	The Easter Island heads that you see in One of Gradius.
3272238	3273619	But then it would get sued by Emotion.
3274720	3277721	Oh, there's joint ownage laws there, apparently.
3278021	3283682	No, Emotion, for long-term anime fans, Emotion uses the Moai head as their mascot.
3283902	3285863	What about getting Sue from Easter Island, okay?
3285903	3289704	They had them way long before, you know, Emotion ever came out with it.
3291764	3292304	I'll stop now.
3292384	3299666	It's something about that, you know, the old-school Emotion, you know, intro with the little 80s, you know, drum rock.
3301237	3302918	A lovely suggestion from the chat room.
3302958	3304879	How about DarkSakura dressed up as Emi?
3305859	3306880	As an unlockable character.
3306900	3307980	I've already done that.
3308020	3309361	But as an unlockable DDR character.
3309981	3310221	Okay.
3310882	3312742	You want to go model for the lovely folks at Konami?
3313223	3316144	Okay, the pictures from Fanime are still up on my FTP.
3316884	3320966	But no, you know, if anybody actually wants to see, I can draw it.
3321526	3322147	I have before.
3323447	3323667	Cool.
3323827	3324968	Maybe we'll make that for the site.
3326047	3327448	HappyNoodleBoy HappyNoodleBoy
3347165	3349567	Skins for... You can have Godzilla as the last character.
3350268	3351168	Go, Godzilla, go.
3351489	3359755	Yeah, but like, on the serious side, I'm thinking that they might do, uh, just another artist, like how they did on 5th Mix with Naoki and, uh, 2MB.
3359855	3362797	I was thinking Togo and Senna.
3364919	3365520	Or Taka.
3365900	3367561	Then if you use the both of them, you have Outface.
3371905	3373526	The one-handed V another guy.
3375129	3375650	Lisu!
3375830	3376811	We need DJ Lisu!
3376891	3378272	Just a giant dancing hand.
3379793	3383617	No, then they'd get sued by Nintendo for the end of Smash Brothers.
3385278	3388961	With a giant hand that, you know, pokes you and flips you off the edge of the world.
3389862	3397209	Well, actually, you know, the game Hand of Fate, one of the Cryorindia games, had a giant hand as the villain, so they could be sued by them, too.
3399045	3407532	Now, Matt, I ask your expert quote-unquote opinion, at least probably being the most educated on all the hacking of various DDR-related things in the room.
3407592	3415159	How long is it going to be before we get people creating their own DDR characters, you think, such as Three-Titted Emmy?
3418321	3418542	Whoa.
3419508	3421609	Well, you know, that all depends on how they're in there.
3421829	3426510	I mean, as far as, like, the music and stuff, it looks like it's pretty much similar to, you know, DDR.
3426530	3428851	It's just one huge bin file that's in there.
3429591	3432192	Um, I'm gonna look at it, see what I can figure out.
3432452	3437053	But, I mean, I'm not that great as far as hacking actual programs and stuff.
3437153	3440414	I'm good with edits, that's about it, but I'll figure out some, maybe.
3441604	3442225	You know what?
3443006	3450899	For anyone, I will pay someone to make me a DarkSakura as a skin for the DDRPC once I get mine.
3450999	3452141	What about PantslessRage?
3453883	3455246	I'm more important, thank you.
3456425	3457745	I get pencils made!
3458085	3468247	Well, actually, now that I think about it, since you do have the add-on characters now, it might be a little bit easier to make these extra characters, because you can look at that and see what's all entailed.
3468807	3470388	I definitely see it possible.
3471068	3473008	So, well, I guess I'll have to wait for that.
3474228	3476069	Seriously, I'll pay you a whole 50 cents.
3476969	3478409	Oh, wait, those are goblin tokens, my bad.
3480690	3481730	But they weren't getting any goblin.
3482290	3483130	That's half a game of DDR.
3484562	3486043	Oh, SoCalKicks is going to send that to you.
3486083	3487384	He's volunteering to create that.
3487885	3488145	Okay.
3489286	3495491	And by the way, he still needs to send me proof that he, you know, got a 90%, you know, full combo on my Look to the Sky edit.
3497686	3509115	Other rumors about DDRPC is that not only will you have the downloadable characters, but you're going to be able to download new interfaces and possibly some new songs.
3510016	3511257	What do you think?
3512098	3515040	For DDRPC, do you think that's a possibility or do you think it's a load of crap?
3515420	3516521	That's a load of crap.
3517702	3519504	I think it's a possibility and it will make it a lot better.
3521055	3522216	But it's a load of crap.
3522496	3522677	Why?
3546418	3571636	Slightly more songs, more Konami originals, same interface, yadda yadda yadda I foresee it happened And then they're gonna have like the downloadable feature that'll like, you know, it'll allow you to un-stone Palamon Forum Blink blink, nevermind Anyway I'm nodding but none of you can hear it because the marbles in my head fell out last night with the party
3574252	3574912	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3593962	3600226	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3617638	3622600	It may look like that there's more arrows at the end there, but actually they don't get saved to the new file.
3622700	3629003	I actually have a whole thing, a whole section in my FAQ that you can find at www.geocities.com.
3629043	3629803	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
3629923	3632184	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3632305	3633485	And blah, blah, blah, blah.
3633885	3635926	DDR Edit Hack FAQ.
3635946	3637627	So you can find that there.
3637747	3637867	Fuck?
3637887	3638327	What?
3638887	3639568	You said fuck.
3639588	3641589	Maybe the people in the chatroom will get lucky and we'll put it there.
3641609	3642029	Lucky.
3644204	3655469	I personally don't feel there's going to be downloadable interfaces and songs because why do that when they can release DDRPC's second mix, Max, Ultra, 2000, three-titted EMI version.
3657170	3660932	We do not need three-titted EMI version, thank you.
3661252	3662733	We need No Pants Rage.
3663965	3666246	Well, you know, they do have all these weird games that come out.
3666286	3668567	Like, there's that Matt Hoffman's BMX.
3668587	3671489	They're actually making, like, a sort of adult version of that.
3671869	3672129	Yes.
3672189	3673270	I'm dead serious, okay?
3673310	3676011	They are making... It's, uh, what was it?
3676491	3679172	Matt Hoffman's Trip... Or, it's like Triple Extreme.
3680113	3681113	Um, I'm serious.
3681514	3684235	I've seen actual articles, and I've seen pictures from it.
3684575	3686756	It's like they're going to have topless riders and stuff like that.
3687597	3689898	You think... No, we meant, of course.
3690738	3691118	Damn.
3691618	3692279	Anyways, so...
3695211	3695691	PlayStation 2.
3696212	3696492	Serious.
3696572	3697153	I have a picture.
3697173	3699434	I will bring it next week.
3700155	3701997	So, maybe they'll do something like that.
3702037	3704338	You know, they'll have strippers and that kind of thing.
3704479	3707101	Maybe we'll see an erotic DDR mix.
3707641	3708081	Oh, yeah.
3708642	3708862	Okay.
3709683	3717709	So all the music in it is erotic and they get, you know... What about DDR Volleyball?
3719491	3720471	DDR Volleyball.
3720992	3722213	DDR Volleyball Edition.
3722393	3723614	You have to explain the reference mode.
3724795	3726139	Dead or Alive Volleyball.
3726701	3728065	All the bouncing you can handle.
3732018	3742106	If anyone is an old-school importer like I am, you might remember a couple of games they put out called Konami World, which were basically different adventure games.
3742126	3747170	They were a little platform game that had a... Each level was taken from various popular comic games.
3747190	3750293	Like there was a Dracula, a Kumajou Dracula 3.
3751213	3754676	There was... Or for Castlevania, for UN-informed.
3755597	3759280	Gradius, you know, Life Force, there was all that.
3759861	3759961	Um...
3760721	3772205	If they did something like that now, it'd be like the DDR minigame, like what's in Tokimeki Memorial, Dancing Summer Vacation, and they would have the pop and music minigame, the 2DX minigame, so you'd be switching out controllers the whole time.
3772505	3777627	Now, I think the absolute coolest character add-on that they could do if they're going to do... Absolute...
3778914	3779494	Shut up!
3779975	3789541	Anyway, the most cool, I don't know, anyway, characters you could download would be Goemon and the Doctor, what's his name, with the blue mustache.
3789802	3790162	Remember?
3790722	3791703	Legend of Mystical Ninja?
3792443	3793504	And who actually played that?
3794265	3794505	Me?
3794525	3795626	I didn't play it.
3795746	3796586	You didn't play it!
3796686	3798328	I knew who Goemon was.
3798468	3800269	I would be sure of all people you would have played it.
3800928	3801729	I rented it once.
3801789	3804190	Because they had, like, they had the little mini Gradius you could play.
3804250	3806992	If there was a new version coming out, it would have a mini DDR, I guarantee you.
3807553	3809514	Yeah, that would actually, that would make sense.
3809814	3816999	Well, I mean, you know, but we've already had DDR as a mini game for, like I said, dancing, summer vacation, for all of you dating sim fans.
3818000	3828267	An interesting comment about DDR PC from our resident joker in the chatroom, Pyroman, saying that you could put the arrows on stealth and then just please yourself watching Hi-Rez Charmy.
3833886	3835848	and we have people with no sex life in our chat room.
3836228	3841112	Anyway, on that note, I think we're going to take a quick break and resituate some things around the room.
3841132	3843233	I think our man needs to prioritize a few things.
3844875	3845655	Now be nice.
3845955	3847697	Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
3848117	3848637	We'll be back.
3864554	3865174	Thanks for watching!
3902063	3902743	Thanks for watching!
3969340	3970411	Is your name?
4019023	4019970	Thanks for watching!
4097125	4098426	Thanks for watching!
4155638	4161304	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Bay Money Music and More show?
4161584	4168732	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
4169052	4171054	It's unearthly.
4171275	4175019	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
4175539	4177601	And that's a message from someone who doesn't get a date.
4179608	4180730	Quit whispering in my ear.
4181711	4185037	We're joined by the individual who likes to whisper sweet nothings into my ear.
4185077	4186179	Say hello, everybody, to Shivam.
4186759	4187260	Hi.
4187300	4188342	Hey, baby.
4188422	4192008	Anyone say hello to the bee money freaks of America, Micah?
4192769	4192909	Hi.
4196867	4199809	Now, Mikey, you don't really play these B-Money games, do you?
4200830	4205533	Everybody sucked at first, except me.
4205613	4206893	I wish that was true.
4206913	4209415	Remember, everybody was a newbie first.
4209595	4212197	Yeah, anyway, moving on to a segment...
4223503	4224464	that we have to do every week.
4224584	4247219	Oh, I have to point out, though, however, for those of you concerned with the potty level of tonight's show, that don't like the fact that we're talking about three-titted individuals and pantsless people and whatever sorts of things, I would just like to state we right now currently have a ratings record on this show right now, so don't say that potty humor doesn't get you ratings, because we're living proof.
4247519	4252883	Anyway, I think we just need to have Mike here more often just to go, fuck shit, fuck all you people, fuck...
4253669	4254290	Fuck shit.
4255190	4256091	Shit fuck, yeah.
4256551	4257032	Beautiful!
4257052	4258353	There's another spike in the ratings.
4258453	4258713	Anyway.
4260534	4261055	Indeed.
4261775	4262876	Yeah, let's just, you know what?
4263317	4267640	Let's just get the hentai, put it in, and then we'll just say the hell with the rest of the show.
4267680	4269341	We'll go watch, we'll go play DDRPC.
4269381	4271783	Rob, no offense, fuck that, but I feel like ditching.
4272123	4272404	No, I know.
4272444	4274986	Okay, we're gonna get... I'm sorry, what?
4275006	4276287	I wanna play DDRPC.
4276467	4278148	DDRPC, do you have DDRPC here?
4278849	4278929	Um...
4280700	4289786	Shivam, it's in the garage, running on my PC, they're politely playing right now The Sims, since The Sims has, you know, 976 songs, whereas DDRPC has 40.
4292768	4293508	Do the math.
4293528	4295289	40 bad songs, so, 976, 40.
4295809	4298851	I love, I, tough decision.
4298971	4304515	I like, love this feeling, hello, because when, all I had was DDR's second mix on Dreamcast.
4305347	4308910	That song came up four damn times in a row on my non-stop.
4308930	4310211	Don't you just love random?
4310231	4311532	You know what I have to laugh at?
4311953	4313214	Endless mode, extra mix.
4313234	4314935	Let the beat hit them four times.
4314955	4315736	Say it again into the mic.
4316236	4317317	Endless mode, extra mix.
4317377	4319619	Let the beat hit them four times in a row.
4320319	4322021	Love This Feeling has nothing on that.
4326070	4331675	What I have to love is at Fry's, they have DDRPC there, and right below it they have Kiki Joys.
4332456	4341723	And for all this, you might be running Sims and stuff, and using Kiki Joys, they don't allow you to push two buttons at the same time when it comes to the directional buttons.
4343805	4344786	I don't know, because they're dumb.
4344806	4346327	That's the only converter that they have.
4346527	4348329	So, wait, who's the company that did it?
4349289	4351171	That issued Kiki Joy?
4351691	4352192	I don't know.
4353328	4353909	Never heard of them.
4354209	4354769	Never heard of them.
4355270	4355910	It just doesn't work.
4356010	4356591	I own one.
4356631	4365279	Yeah, well, if you have a Kiki Joy, fucking light that shit on fire, take a shit on it, and smoke that shit.
4365359	4368782	The big indicator first is it's a giant pink object.
4371598	4373298	I have nothing to say about that color.
4373338	4378760	I've seen giant pink objects like that inserted in places, you know, not used properly.
4378800	4380440	Okay, hold on, let's do this real quick.
4380520	4387941	If you have a Kiki Joy right now, tell us, if you're on the channel, tell us if it works good for you or not.
4388162	4391162	If not, then just tell us whatever the fuck you want out here.
4391182	4395003	In defense of the Kiki Joy, it does work quite well for Metal Gear Solid on PC.
4396163	4399245	Are you saying that it doesn't work on a dance pad?
4418800	4422502	It doesn't work because you can't push left and right or up and down at the same time.
4422582	4424123	Okay, what about a regular controller?
4424323	4425224	Oh, a regular controller is fine.
4425244	4427886	Well, that's what most people... I'm sorry.
4427946	4430287	That's what most people probably do on the PC anyways.
4430967	4433409	Because... But when you buy DDR, you don't...
4433909	4435449	You're not going to go, oh, I'm going to go buy a plate.
4435469	4437270	Call the pad, okay?
4437610	4438730	It's all about the control.
4439550	4441670	It's all about the DDR personal massager, actually.
4442010	4444011	Everybody knows they want their big bumblebee in the back, right?
4444031	4450912	And speaking of fucking things... Anyway, let's change the subject now, because we've got to get to Jamie's F... And actually, everybody's going to participate.
4450932	4452932	Well, not everybody, but, you know, the important people.
4453192	4453553	I'm just kidding.
4453593	4456353	Everything that I had... We'll be participating in the FU of the week this week.
4456373	4459093	Two of the topics I had to bitch about are going to be covered by other people.
4459174	4459314	Yes.
4459334	4460214	However, I will mention them.
4460494	4461094	All right, here we go.
4461194	4461814	Cue my music!
4463666	4464906	Thank you, this is fucked up.
4466007	4466987	Man, this is bad.
4467287	4473488	Anyway, my fuck you of the week, once again, just like last weekend, the week before, goes toward Ragnarok Online.
4474189	4478550	Also, also as... I don't care.
4479090	4480910	This is my fuck you, so fuck you.
4481890	4486551	Anyway, or as my friend referred to it as Cracknarok, but still.
4487352	4488492	Anyway, um...
4489577	4500164	For any people who have been keeping up with the game, and I'm sorry for people who have recently downloaded Syrah, the international servers have gone down for three months.
4500244	4509330	They've gone the further step to ban any North American, European IPs that try to play on the Japanese or Korean servers.
4511571	4513612	I had gotten to where I was enjoying it.
4513632	4515413	It wasn't kicking me off nearly so much.
4517521	4518502	And guess what happened?
4518743	4519904	They go down for three months.
4519984	4522227	So fuck them, fuck them and their stupid asses.
4522747	4524149	I'm downloading a different game now.
4525471	4529315	And the next fuck you of the week goes toward AT&T, which I also hate.
4529576	4531338	I have my fuck you of the week.
4532236	4539402	is for AT&T Cable, because they've given us such wonderful new channels this week.
4539743	4549371	We have Noggin, which is, Noggin fucking rules, because they show the old school 80s Nickelodeon things, and early 90s.
4549431	4552193	Clarissa Explains It All was on, and all this stuff.
4552394	4555937	We get G4, which is the new All Video Games All The Time channel.
4556717	4559899	and we have, what else was on there, BBC America.
4560159	4560479	MTV2.
4560859	4562480	And how does this count as a fuck you again?
4562740	4563280	And MTV2.
4563300	4570644	The reason why this is a fuck you of the week, when I tried to access these channels, it said, we're sorry, this is a subscription service.
4571044	4575586	Even though we're already raping you $50 a month for cable, if you want these channels, you're going to have to pay $20 more.
4576106	4578948	Fuck you, I pay too much for my cable already.
4579848	4585471	You know, why don't you take off these shitty channels I don't want, like, I don't know, MSNBC, and give me...
4586901	4587402	Oxygen.
4587482	4589183	Yes.
4589263	4594747	Take off Lifetime with its fucking... The only fucking cool thing on Lifetime is Shop Till You Drop.
4594867	4597109	And they have that on PAX now.
4597149	4600572	Leave Oxygen on, because I got that old lady with the penis talk show.
4601172	4601833	You seen that?
4601853	4602834	She goes, this is a dick.
4603550	4606811	You put this in a lady's pussy hole.
4607731	4618114	But on Lifetime also they have tons of stories about like lesbians and them getting like raped by their parents and then running away and becoming foster children and all the fucked up shit that you can have all in one like hour and a half show.
4618234	4619995	Rob, I think you need to cue my music again.
4620155	4623476	I'm being told in the chat room that they will activate the channels for free.
4623496	4626336	All you have to do is call maybe for the first month.
4626476	4629477	But you know, if they're free, why don't they just give them to me?
4629497	4630658	Why do I have to call?
4630758	4632118	Do I have to take a survey?
4633012	4637314	Why do you, sir, a 24-year-old individual, want to be watching Noggin Network?
4638274	4639214	Are you a pedophile, sir?
4639294	4640955	No, dammit, I just want to relive my youth.
4641015	4641675	Is that so wrong?
4642455	4643396	I'm sorry, Jamie's music.
4643436	4644676	It's time to re-key my music again.
4645416	4650238	Because my fuck you of the week goes toward AT&T Broadband.
4651118	4671196	Yes, I'm sure quite a few of the people listening know of my drama with AT&T, how I'd be kicked off every few moments, hop up on the tile, go downstairs to check the mode, see that it's back on, go ahead, sign off, AOL, hop back on, and, you know, it's getting frustrating, especially when I was in the middle of, you know, playing that crack game.
4671216	4672157	So, fuck them.
4672757	4674359	Fuck them and their stupid asses.
4675885	4676225	Very nice.
4676545	4681967	Now, Matt also has a Fuck You of the Week, and I don't have any music really for Matt, so I'm just going to give him It's Raining Men.
4684148	4687129	My first Fuck You of the Week goes to Rob, forgive me, It's Raining Men.
4688769	4689649	That's just not right.
4691270	4695851	Anyways, my Fuck You of the Week goes to Fuck You of the Week.
4697352	4698452	It's better than It's Raining Men.
4699753	4704014	Okay, anyways, so we're going to give the Fuck You of the Week to Panda Express.
4705934	4710296	Okay, Panda Express is like this wannabe Chinese food fast food place.
4710576	4715458	They have, like, a few things to order, I mean, and today they're out of practically everything.
4715858	4720240	Does anyone want anything, uh, other, well, white rice, anyone want white rice?
4720300	4723421	So, you know, I guess, okay, I'll get white rice.
4723661	4732744	And then, practically out of everything else, and they, you know, put my stuff in the bag, my napkins got soaked in, I don't know what, some sort of juice.
4733044	4733224	Blood.
4733244	4734365	Yeah, blood, I guess.
4736174	4738395	Panda Express is going to give you AIDS.
4739015	4741276	It was probably Panda I was eating anyways.
4741756	4742877	But that's not the point.
4743817	4744117	Okay.
4744597	4746258	I got sick from my lunch today.
4747158	4748879	And I was avoiding meat for that reason.
4749579	4751880	What pissed me off, I wanted chow mein.
4752521	4763605	I had to wait 25 minutes for them to fucking make some new chow mein because they didn't think that, oh, when it's empty, when it's starting to get empty and we've got a line going out the door, maybe it's time to make some more, you know?
4764725	4767488	You know, not that they could, you know, foresee these things in advance.
4767508	4773894	They have to run out of it first, and then I'll be the next person in line that's like, oh, you gotta wait 25 minutes so we can make more domain.
4773914	4774274	Fuck you!
4774954	4780139	And my second, uh, my second FU week goes to the stupid bitch at, uh, Fry's.
4782401	4785184	Um, let, here's a little information for you.
4786079	4790682	If I'm peeing with a credit card, that means I'm over 18, you dumb bitch.
4790942	4794424	So don't ask me if I'm 18 if I have a credit card here.
4795224	4797446	So what if I'm buying the anime porn?
4797606	4798806	That doesn't mean anything.
4799647	4801808	The dumb bitch had the nerve to tell me.
4802128	4803409	I was like, she's like, are you 18?
4804129	4805210	Well, that's not necessarily true.
4805250	4805830	My brother's only 16.
4805891	4807371	He's got an ATM credit card.
4807752	4809252	It's an ATM card!
4811294	4813395	It's a ATM card, okay?
4814449	4815329	ATM card!
4815389	4819350	She said her 11-year-old son had a fucking credit card.
4819410	4821531	How the fuck is he gonna pay off a credit card?
4821711	4823211	The goddamn kid can't even work!
4823231	4827732	Yeah, but have you been accused of having a false ID when you're 26 years old at the convention?
4827852	4830352	I've been called to hold a platinum card, dude, so it's not even really funny.
4830853	4835354	No, I have not, but I've been refused a movie because I didn't have my ID with me.
4835774	4838734	Stupid Chico Theater not letting me see Deadman on campus.
4840935	4841935	You should be thanking them.
4843300	4845541	Yes, I did see that later on, yeah, I'm scarred for life.
4846081	4851104	No, I was at, this was one of my other fuck you's from Anime Expo that I haven't brought up yet.
4851644	4857247	The fact that when I went to go buy, by the way, the doujinshi didn't turn out to be yaoi, by the way, you know.
4857807	4860868	No yaoi, oh no, no gay penis, what will we do?
4861369	4867331	But no, the guy there, the guy there wanted me to get my mom, so that I could buy doujinshi.
4870208	4873370	and then I showed him my license and my ID.
4875391	4884055	On the topic of anime porn, I have another FU that's long overdue that goes to the stupid makers of that movie, Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.
4884195	4886016	Goddamn, that movie sucks ass.
4886136	4887877	It's just like horrible flash anime.
4887917	4888918	Who the fuck bought that?
4889178	4889798	Why?
4890138	4895681	That was a horrible flash anime that someone made years and years ago and someone actually went out and published.
4895741	4897162	I can't believe you paid for it.
4897642	4898983	What the fuck is wrong with you?
4899955	4900635	It was funny.
4900675	4901535	He was dumb.
4902636	4906257	I was stupid again.
4906277	4906317	No!
4908397	4910758	Anyway, have we got to the fucking everyone?
4911818	4914779	Well, I don't know.
4915259	4915959	Now serving, 47.
4916940	4921401	Anyway, DDRholic, hi by the way.
4922285	4923907	I hope we see you at Golfland this week.
4924427	4928051	Says that they issue credit cards to kids with prepaid limits from Daddy.
4928811	4935598	Like one of those secured credit cards where, like, Daddy pays $300 so, you know, Junior can have a $300 credit card to buy anime porn with.
4935938	4941684	Okay, but my credit card didn't say, oh, look, it's a kid card, you know, with the big happy smiley face and the rainbow.
4941704	4943866	It doesn't have Ronald McDonald on it.
4944346	4944987	No, it doesn't.
4945607	4951389	And the dumb bitch didn't even have the smarts to look at my fucking, you know... So you didn't get the Sailor Moon platinum card then?
4951889	4953309	To go with your Seven Balls purchase?
4954369	4954849	No, I did not.
4954909	4956450	I can't believe you bought that, dude.
4956470	4957090	What the fuck?
4957710	4962791	Of all the goddamn gimpy anime porn out there, you got something that I could make in my fucking sleeve.
4963752	4965292	He wouldn't have the Sailor Moon one.
4965312	4968513	He's, you know, did think he was younger, so he had, like, Superdoll Lekotan or something.
4969053	4970455	Yay, my Gundam credit card.
4970475	4972198	Hey, okay, I like watching... Platinum 2.
4972698	4977445	I like watching 10 frame animation with stupid sound clips repeated over and over again.
4977465	4978587	Then play DDR.
4980790	4982933	Well... Oh yeah, gotcha there.
4985572	4986012	Good point.
4988514	4989875	It's like the song selects sequence.
4989915	4993938	You know, you sit there and listen to the worst sample out of the fucking one and a half minutes they could possibly pick.
4993958	5001203	Well, you know, that would kind of bring us back to that old topic we were just talking about, about the characters and all the... No pants rage.
5003105	5004566	Anyway, moving right along.
5005887	5006467	I don't know to what.
5006487	5008689	I don't really have any other subjects to discuss today.
5009429	5010030	Patsy Blue.
5010910	5011371	Oh, wait, hold on.
5012717	5013818	Yeah, I get to talk again.
5014478	5016019	Pepsi Blue is really good.
5016059	5016819	Hey, shut up!
5018900	5020341	Pepsi Blue is hella good.
5020781	5022622	Everybody at the tournament was drinking that.
5022642	5023803	Shut up!
5024203	5025324	Yeah, okay, anyway.
5025804	5026744	That shit was good.
5027185	5029706	Fucking Rediffusion takes, like, cough syrup.
5029746	5031247	What do you think, Jens?
5032242	5033243	I like Red Fusion better.
5033623	5034564	Go to hell anyways.
5035204	5036606	Pepsi Blue owns your daddy.
5036906	5038427	I want to tell some stories.
5038707	5044092	Let's talk about, let's make this be Imani related and talk about refreshing drinks to play when playing DDR.
5044332	5045273	Pocari Sweat.
5046514	5055861	Um, obviously Ramun, which is probably the greatest drink that ever came in a pixie cup with that damn marble in there so you can't tell how much fucking liquid is in there to begin with.
5056622	5057362	No, no, no, no, no.
5057443	5059104	It's all about Pocari Sweat.
5059730	5060610	What the fuck?
5061151	5061831	Pokari Sweat.
5061891	5068114	Pokari Sweat looks like sweat, smells like sweat, tastes like sweetened sweat, and comes in a goddamn bottle that says sweat.
5069715	5072996	Pokari Sweat is the absolute winner of all fitness drinks.
5073016	5075797	It's one of the worst sports drinks I've ever had in my goddamn life.
5076598	5079159	I would just like to thank Shiva for that lovely description of Pokari Sweat.
5079519	5080880	Thank you, Captain Obvious!
5082065	5084527	Hey, you couldn't have thought of a better fucking name for it.
5085167	5089870	It tastes like, it's citrusy, but it's supposed to be like Gatorade, but it doesn't taste like shit.
5090071	5091351	It looks like salty water.
5091692	5092872	And it tastes like it, too.
5093313	5094694	It is not as salty as Gatorade.
5094814	5097796	I like that shit that you bought at... My Propel Water is winter.
5097816	5098977	Propel Water, I like that.
5098997	5100338	Propel Water is absolute winter.
5100778	5109404	Well, speaking of the Gatorade sweat thing, I mean, you know, you see them sweating out that shit, and I'm sure they're just collecting it, and there you go, that's how they get that shit, you know?
5112835	5123225	I've already stated that when we open our Tapioca Express, I'm going to try to have a Pocari Sweat Vending Machine.
5124506	5126488	Boba's an entirely different subject, man.
5126528	5127990	I had that freaking starfruit flavor.
5128010	5128590	It tasted like ass.
5129651	5131472	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
5147435	5152239	and Rob with the... No, no, not those.
5152359	5155142	I'm talking about like actual little balls.
5155182	5157204	You can use them to give someone a back massage.
5158285	5158845	Right.
5159085	5160707	Balls!
5161587	5161748	No.
5163049	5167833	The Propel water basically tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid shit, so it's really awesome.
5169254	5170035	Oh, we got plenty of time.
5170075	5170675	Who cares, dude?
5170815	5171836	We'll talk until they throw us off.
5173146	5177171	Yes, share with us.
5177191	5179754	Before you start your story, I'm going to give you story music, okay?
5180014	5184099	So let's find some story music for Mike.
5184119	5186922	It's about our little Mexican friend, Jose.
5187523	5190827	Now don't make this a racist story or I'm going to have to... Okay, okay.
5190867	5191207	Cool.
5193089	5193349	Yes.
5194469	5195230	Alright, here we go.
5198211	5200172	Let's talk to Mike and let's hear Mike's story.
5200192	5204454	What's the music?
5205254	5206275	The Journey to Wonderland.
5206735	5207195	Word!
5207375	5214859	Anyway, okay, as all of you know, you know the guy, Jose, who ran the Fremont tournament.
5216292	5232998	Anyway, you all know he was at the tournament on Thursday and Friday, and a couple of my friends, DCB and Chaos, come up to me and they randomly ask me, why does Jose smell like shit?
5233738	5237139	And why is he wearing the same clothes as he was the day before?
5238480	5239980	I'm really afraid of where this is going.
5241020	5245502	You've all been to Sunnyvale Golf Land, hopefully, and you've all seen the giant clown mouth.
5246042	5273471	and hopefully you've all seen the picture where you all know that somebody's pissed in the clown mouth anyway you crazy Sunnyvale people so the word's going around that like JL Chiz the Mexican guy slept in the clown mouth Thursday night because he had no ride home from the tournament because it was a two day tournament so yeah that's my story
5275675	5279879	It was supposed to be funny, but nobody's laughing, so I feel like an idiot now.
5280259	5280859	I'm blinking.
5281840	5284983	We're not laughing at you, we're laughing inside.
5285403	5287405	I'm not a Pop 8, but I'm a Cool 7.
5289727	5290748	And I'm a Soul 6.
5293149	5293930	And I'm not going there.
5293950	5294651	Hey, I'm from 2DX.
5296727	5297768	We badly need a break.
5297928	5299390	Oh, did Matt want to say something real fast?
5299670	5305116	Uh, well, I was just going to talk about my experience of playing Samba Day, whatever that crap is.
5305416	5306097	Make it snappy.
5306397	5306657	Today.
5307098	5308359	Well, I was going to do it after break.
5308499	5309220	Alright, we'll do it after break.
5310188	5312049	We're going to take a quick break.
5312089	5312809	We'll be right back.

5797311	5798211	Do it all night.
5798472	5799352	Do it with me.
5799772	5801193	No, no, that was awful.
5801253	5802134	Bloody terrible.
5802174	5803515	Do you take vocal lessons?
5803595	5804556	Kill your teacher.
5805056	5806057	In the heat of the night.
5806517	5808739	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
5809920	5810580	I liked it.
5811080	5812622	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
5812742	5813162	Next.
5816032	5817474	Uh, that was cool.
5818875	5820618	Do you even know why you're here?
5820638	5822941	That was just bloody pathetic, Nyx!
5824402	5825824	Come on, Ava.
5825864	5827326	Come on, do it with me.
5828267	5828467	Yes!
5828888	5829509	Yes, that's it!
5829869	5830931	We have a winner!
5831778	5837082	A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5837102	5839624	Ah, chat room demanding we make some new promos tonight.
5839644	5840364	They're sick of these ones.
5840404	5841165	I can't say I believe them.
5841185	5841986	You know what?
5842026	5844027	I would assume that we could do a few more.
5844127	5844347	Yes.
5844407	5848010	You know, we could talk about No Pants Rage and 3-Ted Evie.
5850252	5850672	Hooray.
5850852	5851713	Hooray for boobies.
5851773	5854054	Or they're suggesting maybe something involving Politary.
5854134	5855976	I don't know.
5856316	5858578	How about us killing Politary in front of Corona Blender?
5861968	5863850	We'll see what we come up with during the week.
5864350	5866352	Anyway, let's see.
5867674	5868274	What else did they say?
5868294	5868975	They said something else.
5869075	5873099	Oh yeah, they wanted us to talk about how American Idol is trying to warp our minds.
5873679	5874760	No, we have a segment to do.
5874881	5876662	Anyway, we're going to do Listless.
5877323	5877623	Yes.
5877763	5879285	Yes, we're going to bring back another.
5879305	5881987	Speaking of old shit, we're going to do...
5883820	5885401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5913843	5926869	and then we each go around and we put up our items until we have a list, in this case of 15, then each of us goes around voting to put one off, then we leave it to our chatroom to vote what the final result's going to be.
5927749	5929210	Don't you think I summed that up nicely?
5929350	5934372	Yes, so on that note... Let's play Listless!
5935613	5938374	That was way too easy.
5938394	5939275	That was beautiful though.
5940797	5941857	Speaking of lovely intelligence.
5942338	5943558	So who wants to start this one?
5943578	5944478	Let's start with our guests.
5944838	5945479	Let's start with our guests.
5945539	5947439	Mike, you're number... Oh, our topic tonight.
5948219	5949640	Oh yes, we have a topic tonight.
5949680	5953381	And that topic is what we feel is the best 2DX video.
5953421	5955822	The best videos in 2DX ever.
5955922	5959703	And the chat room, you guys are going to get a chance to vote on our finished list.
5959743	5961444	And you guys will determine the top three.
5961964	5962764	So here we go.
5962864	5965445	Starting with DDR Mike giving his number three pick.
5966285	5969628	Okay, my number three pick would be Wow Wow 70s.
5970089	5971550	Ah, good choice, Wow Wow 70s.
5972691	5973352	Number two!
5973372	5975074	Wait, no, no, no, you don't get to explain it.
5975094	5975814	Explain it?
5975934	5977696	Just a brief synopsis for those that may not have seen it.
5978557	5986744	The song kicks ass, and... No, fuck that shit.
5987105	5989127	The song just kicks ass, I'm just gonna say that.
5990419	5991600	The video is really cool.
5991620	5992721	It's really detailed.
5993662	5995884	I like how they have all the characters and shit in it.
5996704	6000688	Unlike Colors or Frozen Wave with all that fucking gay shit.
6000868	6002309	Alright, come on, Justin.
6002609	6003049	Your pick.
6004070	6004250	What?
6004331	6005852	He needs a microphone to do it.
6005872	6008934	For number three, I pick a song that I cannot say.
6009935	6011637	I think that's how you say it.
6012317	6018082	It's a video from Second Cell, I believe, and the girl is dancing in the window.
6019125	6021627	All she does through the video, dance in the window and sing the song.
6021907	6022767	How cool can you get?
6026990	6028791	Cool as Ice, featuring Vanilla Ice.
6031072	6032533	Okay, how about Matt?
6034370	6035851	My pick would have to go to G2.
6036471	6036711	G2.
6037732	6039893	And briefly explain G2 a little bit.
6040173	6044415	G2 has the creepy alien chick flying around looking like something.
6044435	6044775	Tran.
6045135	6049197	Yeah, Tran flying around looking like she's attacking the cameraman.
6049237	6051798	It's very dark and goes with the song very well.
6052078	6052459	Sounds good.
6052839	6053159	Shamey.
6054568	6068223	My number three, um, which, uh, from my list would have to be Ride on the Light, because, uh, well, as my fiancé has described it, it's basically, um, like an Eva, Evangelion fight done with little chibi thingies.
6069724	6070385	Alright, fair enough.
6070725	6075951	My number three pick is, uh, Right Now by Atomic Kitten, because, um,
6077997	6083679	I just, I like crap, and it reminds me of Spice Girls, so there you go, right now.
6083819	6086900	Hold on, Rob, I'm going to be giving you an early birthday present.
6087020	6087241	Yes.
6089181	6090462	Okay, alright.
6090562	6091422	What, are you going to fart?
6092903	6094223	That's not a present, okay.
6095363	6097084	It's a present everyone can share.
6097584	6098485	Nah, there it is.
6098505	6102206	You know, it's not the Spice Girls, if you're talking about crap, it's the Shice Girls.
6104111	6104872	Anyway, you're right.
6104912	6107414	GDR Mike, let's hear the number two choice of yours.
6107834	6111177	Number two for me would be 250 BPM.
6111197	6111638	250 BPM.
6111698	6117563	Because of the crazy shit, baby, devil baby fucking schizo shit.
6117603	6118663	I'm about to have a seizure.
6119304	6120625	The Satan fetus must die.
6120845	6122026	Yeah, exactly.
6122567	6123688	Kill the fucking fetus.
6125890	6127231	My pick is Love is Dreaminess.
6127431	6128452	Love is Dreaminess.
6132899	6138922	Just because running robots are that cool.
6140122	6144405	Okay, my second pick would have to go to Romeo and Juliet.
6144885	6145685	Romeo and Juliet.
6145725	6148426	Because of those crazy neon bears in the background.
6148687	6149407	They're so cute.
6151264	6155626	My number two would have to be for the cutest video ever, Sweet Lab.
6156026	6156526	Sweet Lab.
6156566	6157306	Oh, that's a good pick.
6157326	6160388	I didn't even think of that one.
6161028	6161448	It's so cute.
6161468	6161548	Okay.
6161648	6163389	Briefly describe the Sweet Lab video a little bit.
6163409	6170432	It's just us little cute little thingies walking through the forest being cute and doing more cute things.
6170912	6173853	I hardly ever get to watch the video because usually I'm cussing at the song while I'm playing it.
6176274	6176574	Okay.
6177214	6177415	What?
6178035	6178495	Crackers!
6179246	6180326	How could you forget that?
6180426	6181527	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6181567	6183087	You weren't here when we started making our picks.
6183107	6184048	You can't play right now.
6184468	6185188	You can play next week.
6185908	6186288	I'm sorry.
6186668	6187369	You can listen, though.
6188089	6189729	Maybe somebody has Cracker right now.
6189769	6192370	We're not to the end of the list yet.
6192430	6193550	We're not to the end of the list yet.
6195171	6195491	Okay.
6195731	6196291	Next.
6196411	6197592	Next, my pick.
6197632	6199212	Did I get your pick right now?
6199232	6200613	Yes, Sweet Lab, I did get it right now.
6200653	6203974	My number two pick is a very new one, but it's fucking hilarious.
6204034	6204774	The Strong Yeager.
6205788	6209611	Yes, with, with, you know, the, with Dungeon Jay humping himself.
6211653	6212894	And that's, wasn't that a Jaeger?
6213414	6214035	Didn't you say that?
6215736	6217337	Alright, so the strong Jaeger.
6219339	6222902	Anyway, Shivam's trying to take over the controls here, but he can't because we're trying to do something here.
6223222	6224543	Alright, number one picks.
6225704	6231629	Okay, my number one pick would be Cheer Train, because it has the coolest lyrics ever.
6233030	6233170	And...
6234391	6240813	Yeah, and it's all clay animation and shit, and, like, the stop animation is really cool.
6241674	6241954	Cool.
6242074	6242954	Yeah, I like, I like Sheertrain.
6242974	6244235	Yeah, so, cool, cool, cool.
6245475	6245735	Good.
6245775	6246075	Cool.
6246655	6247796	Go figure, that was mine.
6248476	6251037	Oh, alright, Sheertrain, number one pick for you too, alright, fair enough.
6252217	6256219	Alright, my all-time favorite has to be, uh, Gradius Cyber.
6256239	6256279	Ah!
6259417	6260038	Whatever!
6260178	6260798	I don't care.
6260818	6263681	I made the same mistake last week.
6263701	6268225	It has a really kick-ass animation video, very similar to Burning Heat, but it's awesome.
6268245	6271248	You always call it graduistic, and that is not right.
6273130	6273490	Whatever.
6274351	6274731	Whatever.
6274872	6275552	I'll do what I want.
6275612	6276273	I'll do what I want.
6276413	6277774	I'm actually changing my number one.
6278155	6278575	You can't.
6279036	6279476	Too bad.
6279576	6280417	I'm a woman.
6280437	6280857	I can do it.
6280877	6281478	I have boobs.
6282679	6284541	As much as I love reincarnation...
6286475	6293279	I actually am going to vote for Burning Heat simply because I am such a Gradius II fan, it's not even funny.
6294379	6300042	And that just is like, completely brings back the frustration of, you know, fighting the Fire Dragons and everything.
6300582	6300882	Fair enough.
6301242	6304204	Well, my number one pick also happens to already be on the list.
6304244	6306385	I put down Love is Dreaminess as my number one pick, so.
6306685	6308286	Then you can stick with Reincarnation.
6309523	6312224	I'll, uh, I don't know, give it to a wild card.
6312645	6314225	We never hear from Bradley on this show.
6314245	6314565	What do you want?
6314585	6315566	You get a wild card pick.
6315606	6319488	Any 2DX video.
6320768	6321489	Think, man, think!
6322009	6328012	I like the video, but that's not my favorite.
6328112	6330513	Uh, Outer Wall.
6330533	6332274	Dude, Outer Wall.
6332454	6333314	Outer Wall, okay.
6333514	6334335	So there's a wild card pick.
6334375	6334715	Outer Wall.
6336912	6337893	Now here's the fun part!
6337953	6341535	Now we're gonna go around the room and you get to take one song off of the list.
6341856	6344037	So, starting with... DDR Mike.
6344578	6345578	You see the list right in front of you?
6345618	6349061	You can take off any one of those songs you think, why the hell is that song there?
6351462	6354965	Romeo and Juliet, because fuck, fuck, fuck Para!
6355445	6357427	And fuck all you Paralists out there!
6357767	6358968	You fucking faggots!
6359528	6361390	Fucking die, ParaParaTiger!
6361610	6364552	I'm gonna fucking cut your dick off, you bitch!
6365552	6366833	I encourage people to rave on Parapara.
6366873	6371255	You can send those cards and letters to DDR Mike, Kara of Sunnyvale Golfland.
6373916	6376038	Needless to say, Romeo and Juliet is off the list.
6376178	6379740	Oh, and a big hearty fuck you Mike from the chat room.
6379760	6382081	There you go.
6382421	6383702	I say bye bye to G2.
6384302	6385643	Bye bye to G2.
6387444	6387964	So long.
6388284	6388584	Next.
6389365	6389645	Next.
6391077	6395999	I'm going to have to say bye-bye to your drink because I hate the lyrics.
6396399	6399260	I hate the lyrics and I think the little peeps are stupid.
6400500	6401641	Stand by to win.
6401721	6402781	No, stand by to lose.
6405082	6409303	I vote for 2.50 BPM to go bye-bye because this Satan fetus scares me.
6409863	6415425	No, I literally had nightmares about the damn Satan fetus when I first played Fourth Style, so no.
6416698	6419280	Okay, and I'm taking off.
6419460	6423864	I hate to do it, but Toto at Kazan, no, I, no, that's second style.
6423904	6424404	It's too old.
6424624	6425025	It's too old.
6425045	6425545	So, it's gone.
6425845	6427367	It's classic.
6428728	6430829	So that leaves us with our list.
6431390	6437214	Wow Wow 70s, Ride on the Light, Right Now, How did that stay?
6437254	6437915	I'm so happy.
6438235	6444140	Love is Dreaminess, Sweet Lab, The Strong Jaeger, Graduistic Cyber,
6445327	6448029	Burning Heat, and Outer Wall.
6448309	6449250	Those are our choices.
6449490	6452532	And if you would like to vote on those, you have to be in the chat room.
6452572	6455754	Just send me a private message with your vote.

6463019	6464380	I only take it through private message.

6466902	6467943	You said right now.
6468283	6472485	You've got a whopping three minutes to vote.
6472505	6476286	We're going to throw on a quick song and then we'll tally up the votes and that'll be the end of the damn show.
6477046	6485390	So, okay, we'll give you a request from Jamie because she's a woman and she wants to hear a woman's song.
6485410	6486250	So here's Batgirls.

6708194	6719546	Hope no one discovers, I see you every day, secret hideaway, just around the way, if you're so close to me, cause, no one will ever see us, what we have to lose, our secret rendezvous.
6735054	6747740	Linkin' with my baby, we can dance and make it Roll away the king, it's a fantasy, only you and me I want no one that's gone, and we're under common numbers What we have to lose, I'll see if I never forget
6761897	6768731	Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.
6769465	6775548	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
6775888	6777769	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

6795694	6796754	Yes.
6796774	6799216	The always, I should say, the always colorful DDR Mike.
6800497	6800717	Yes.
6801437	6802938	I was hoping he'd say fuck yes.
6803038	6805460	Alright, and, uh, fuck yes.
6806020	6806340	Thank you.
6806821	6810763	And, uh, big thank you also to Jazz for being here.
6810783	6811123	Meow.
6812064	6812484	Well put.
6812904	6815266	Well, we're not saying goodbye just yet.
6815386	6816166	We're not saying goodbye just yet.
6816206	6818768	I just wanted to make sure we thanked you guys for being here and coming out tonight.
6818948	6820229	You guys think you might be back sometime soon?
6820888	6821268	Yes?
6824470	6825311	Goddamn, yes.
6827352	6827752	Very well.
6829013	6837939	Let us then reveal our top three, as decided by the whole listless procedure, I don't know what the hell you want to call it, top three 2DX videos.
6838599	6839360	Here we go.
6840520	6845544	In third place, drumroll please, Burning Heat.
6847345	6848946	Alright, hooray for Burning Heat, okay.
6849528	6850629	Let's give them some privilege.
6851090	6856555	In second place is the Strong Yeager.
6859738	6866164	And in first place for the super duper bestest ever 2DX video is everybody.
6867860	6869981	is Love is Dreaminess!
6870662	6871442	Yay!
6871562	6880706	Okay, so, there's our winners, and, uh, oh yeah, yeah, they win, and we'll give our winner song a little victory dance here.
6881207	6881667	Give me a minute.
6883067	6884148	Prepare your drill.
6886089	6889651	Get the Lego Man out, it's time to play Love is Dreaminess.
6890311	6891932	Or Love is, you know, also on crack.
6898110	6898631	Love is a Hallucination
6921201	6922082	We got a few minutes left.
6922302	6924163	Somebody's trying to catch my attention in the chat room.
6924183	6925644	Just tell me whatever the hell you want to say.
6925905	6926605	We'll talk about it.
6926645	6928447	We got a few more seconds here on the show.
6928467	6929487	I'm being sent a private message.
6929508	6930708	We have as long as we want to have.
6930728	6931990	Okay, let's let Matt talk there.
6932730	6935993	Okay, so I finally got to play that Samba de Amigo or whatever that is.
6936413	6937234	That game is weird.
6937254	6939856	Okay, they want you to strike poses and shit like that.
6939876	6942738	It's got, you know, fucking Ricky Martin and the Macarena.
6943479	6944640	That's just a bad combo, man.
6946543	6952546	You need my VMU file that has the Burning Ranger song on it and the song from Austin Powers.
6952706	6956448	And yes, we get a thumbs up from that.
6957769	6960710	And you know, the Oopa Oopa theme from Fantasy Zone.
6961631	6962551	You ever play Fantasy Zone?
6964372	6966073	Ah, poor deprived person.
6967714	6969475	I thought you guys were talking about something that should be on the air.
6971125	6971745	We're just about to.
6971785	6974546	I'm being sent one more preview song for 8th Style.
6974606	6976527	This is Past Career, it's called.
6976567	6980228	It's being sent to me so I can play it for you over the show in a minute.
6980908	6984470	Who is the artist?
6985350	6986150	I have no clue.
6986350	6987151	Where is this from?
6987211	6990112	It's not on my list of songs in 8th Style.
6992872	6994333	Yeah, you gotta tell me where the hell this is from.
6995413	6996334	The person who's sending it to me.
6997874	6998354	Please do.
6998394	6999995	Where you got it?
7002078	7002658	It takes a minute.
7003219	7004599	Use both hands.
7005139	7007139	Oh, he's saying it's the 7th style theme.
7007840	7008920	Why does it say 8th style?
7011481	7013181	It's supposedly the 7th style theme.
7013201	7018042	It's by DJ Past.
7019302	7021243	What about DJ Present and DJ Future?
7021483	7023923	I'm getting angry faces for berating him over the radio.
7025104	7026544	Dude, it's okay.
7026584	7027484	We still love you.
7028985	7029405	I don't know.
7029465	7029965	This could be...
7032857	7034838	I'll just play this, I don't know what the hell it is.
7034938	7038459	Hey, Pantless Rage.
7040119	7043420	And it's going to be a little moment while we go ahead and get that up for everybody.
7045221	7048642	This could be a whole load of crap for all I know, so we're about ready to find out.
7049502	7051203	This could just be, this could be porno noises.
7051483	7052063	Cool.
7052983	7053704	Pantless Rage.
7057885	7059165	Oh yeah, this is a 7th style theme.
7059225	7059785	I know this song.
7059805	7060166	Pretty cool.
7060206	7061286	Yeah, I've heard this before.
7067979	7068840	Dude, very cool.
7068860	7070941	This is playable on 8th style.
7071061	7071942	On 8er style.
7073363	7073583	Aired.
7073623	7076705	But, you know.
7076745	7078827	I can imagine this would be really difficult.
7078887	7082609	Tomorrow Perfume was the theme of 2DX 6th style, and now it's in 7th style.
7082630	7086132	Yeah, but we're talking about 2DX, not Beatmania, not Five Finger Gayness.
7086232	7088193	I still am of the opinion that
7099348	7101409	Maybe that should be our clip of the week.
7101649	7106370	Thank you SoCalKicks for sending me that file because if I don't say his name he'll cry.
7106550	7108191	Anyway, I'm sorry, what?
7108231	7109731	He was talking about five fingering.
7110872	7111672	I still have you beat.
7111732	7113052	I talked about the king of iron fingering.
7113393	7115273	On that note, we are going to close out the show.
