00:30.607 --> 00:32.608
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't this 4215, pussywaves?

00:33.028 --> 00:33.729
[SPEAKER_22]: You bitch!

00:33.789 --> 00:35.750
[SPEAKER_22]: Now let me check the zip code.

00:35.770 --> 00:36.790
[SPEAKER_22]: 212, fuck you!

00:36.810 --> 00:38.451
[SPEAKER_22]: You have no morals, darling.

00:38.571 --> 00:43.433
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of curtains.

00:43.453 --> 00:45.794
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss my grip, noob.

00:45.814 --> 00:48.136
[SPEAKER_00]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.337
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

00:50.577 --> 00:51.717
[SPEAKER_22]: Me too!

00:51.977 --> 00:52.458
[SPEAKER_22]: Fucker, yeah?

00:52.658 --> 00:53.618
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on it.

00:54.359 --> 00:54.779
[SPEAKER_09]: Loser.

00:54.939 --> 00:55.499
[SPEAKER_22]: Lame!

00:55.839 --> 00:57.360
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the size of my face.

00:58.382 --> 01:02.846
[SPEAKER_19]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

01:03.246 --> 01:08.951
[SPEAKER_19]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

01:09.392 --> 01:12.114
[SPEAKER_19]: I am your singing telegram.

01:15.038 --> 01:23.022
[SPEAKER_14]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:23.443 --> 01:27.765
[SPEAKER_14]: You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.

01:28.205 --> 01:30.466
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:30.806 --> 01:36.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically I would be saying, joining me as always is my lovely co-host Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

01:36.569 --> 01:39.111
[SPEAKER_14]: However, she's out tonight in Vegas.

01:39.946 --> 01:40.507
[SPEAKER_14]: I see ice cream.

02:05.448 --> 02:06.129
[SPEAKER_14]: You want ice cream?

02:06.669 --> 02:07.829
[SPEAKER_14]: They're ice cream candy.

02:07.849 --> 02:08.950
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ice cream time!

02:08.970 --> 02:10.070
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, they're ice cream.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ice cream time!

02:11.931 --> 02:13.911
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know what ice cream time probably sounds like.

02:13.991 --> 02:14.311
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:16.492 --> 02:20.254
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, we're also, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.694
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to Joe, also known as DarkTetsuya.

02:22.714 --> 02:23.095
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey.

02:23.475 --> 02:25.615
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got Irene, the Rice Princess.

02:26.236 --> 02:28.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there alcohol in Vanilla Coke?

02:28.236 --> 02:28.777
[SPEAKER_14]: There might be.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.517
[SPEAKER_14]: In that one, perhaps.

02:30.837 --> 02:32.358
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've also got Bradley.

02:34.122 --> 02:39.722
[SPEAKER_14]: and Brad I don't say anything, I don't like you anyway

02:40.683 --> 02:44.865
[SPEAKER_14]: This is episode number 10 for August 25th of 2002.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.888
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be talking to all our guests a little more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

02:49.748 --> 02:54.130
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this break, we're going to have all a bunch of Euromix 2 stuff.

02:54.731 --> 02:56.712
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, dear God, no.

02:56.752 --> 02:57.272
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have to start.

02:57.292 --> 02:58.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

02:58.593 --> 03:03.336
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting off, we're going to have Vanity Angel with Fix here on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.195
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear the cheering?

03:29.255 --> 03:29.995
[SPEAKER_21]: Super performance!

04:11.972 --> 04:12.834
Thanks for watching!

04:42.378 --> 04:44.840
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dance showed us a dream for the future.

04:45.321 --> 04:46.622
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow is another day.

04:47.143 --> 04:49.325
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.038
[SPEAKER_25]: I am sure of what I want, tell me what you want

06:14.093 --> 06:15.894
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

07:50.079 --> 07:56.822
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

07:57.162 --> 08:02.065
[SPEAKER_31]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

08:02.765 --> 08:08.868
[SPEAKER_31]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.089
[SPEAKER_31]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

08:11.669 --> 08:16.031
[SPEAKER_31]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

08:16.559 --> 08:18.801
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you, Mel, for letting us know that one.

08:19.381 --> 08:20.802
[SPEAKER_14]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:20.842 --> 08:23.564
[SPEAKER_14]: In that set, we had all Euromix 2 stuff.

08:24.024 --> 08:26.086
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting it off, Vanity Angel with Fix.

08:26.346 --> 08:29.188
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the middle there, Love You Like a Fool by Jessica Folker.

08:29.448 --> 08:30.849
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of sounds a little bit like Divas.

08:30.869 --> 08:32.310
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit of that R&B stuff.

08:32.590 --> 08:32.911
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

08:33.051 --> 08:34.091
[SPEAKER_14]: What the Folker was that?

08:34.552 --> 08:34.952
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh, Brent?

08:38.655 --> 08:42.317
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, if you didn't know that one, probably one of the most well-known songs on there.

08:42.437 --> 08:44.519
[SPEAKER_14]: At least I know that one very well.

08:44.799 --> 08:46.020
[SPEAKER_14]: Rednecks with Cotton Eye Joe.

08:47.476 --> 08:49.738
[SPEAKER_14]: They're either rednecks, but they spell it the leet way.

08:49.778 --> 08:54.562
[SPEAKER_14]: They spell it a rednecks with an X. Like, oh yeah, they're out to get you.

08:56.163 --> 09:03.469
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have to ask Melody if Melody can get on the mic here, because Melody gets asked this question all the time.

09:03.509 --> 09:04.289
[SPEAKER_14]: We just played the promo.

09:04.309 --> 09:04.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is Mel B.?

09:06.147 --> 09:07.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel's not here.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.351
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I'm getting a shirt that says that.

09:11.371 --> 09:12.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel's not here.

09:12.632 --> 09:14.513
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but Mel's in the same place where Jamie's at.

09:14.533 --> 09:15.634
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all in Vegas together.

09:16.175 --> 09:17.696
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's any secret.

09:17.736 --> 09:22.740
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a little moderator's convention going on in Vegas for DDR freaks.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.961
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where they're all at right now.

09:24.161 --> 09:25.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Drinking the night away.

09:26.082 --> 09:28.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Every mod asks me, are you going along too?

09:28.164 --> 09:28.884
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going along too?

09:28.964 --> 09:29.805
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not a mod.

09:29.845 --> 09:30.445
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't go.

09:30.645 --> 09:31.286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm poor.

09:31.726 --> 09:35.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless anyone wanted to sponsor me for a trip to Vegas, it just wasn't happening.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.350
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure Jamie's having tons of fun down there.

09:37.410 --> 09:43.414
[SPEAKER_14]: She was going to be recording some interviews for us, hopefully, because there's a lot of well-known people in the community that are going to be there.

09:43.874 --> 09:48.337
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get the tape player to take down there and tape some stuff.

09:48.377 --> 09:49.698
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're shit out of luck.

09:49.758 --> 09:52.080
[SPEAKER_14]: But hey, that just means we're just going to have to go around...

09:52.680 --> 09:55.682
[SPEAKER_14]: throughout the community and get the interviews, you know, at other times.

09:56.002 --> 10:06.029
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully we get a drunken voicemail because for the Saturday night program that I do under SedationLive.org, they're supposed to be leaving a drunken voicemail for that show.

10:06.129 --> 10:09.952
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pretty sure I'd be able to use that drunken voicemail on this show if we can get it.

10:10.052 --> 10:10.652
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

10:10.772 --> 10:11.092
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

10:11.372 --> 10:11.953
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

10:13.924 --> 10:21.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I was just given a link to read some results for a tournament that happened yesterday at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco.

10:22.292 --> 10:23.093
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't been there yet.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.114
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear it's really cool though.

10:24.154 --> 10:26.836
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a golf land in San Francisco is what they're calling it.

10:26.856 --> 10:30.279
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they got, I believe, Dance Maniacs as well?

10:30.860 --> 10:31.661
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of a question mark.

10:31.681 --> 10:36.245
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know they also have a Beatmania 3 7th, which is not a very commonly seen machine.

10:36.946 --> 10:46.149
[SPEAKER_14]: So the results of that contest were first place was Uncle Fuzz of .half, and second place was the Asian Harry Potter of .half.

10:47.209 --> 10:48.309
[SPEAKER_14]: The Asian Harry Potter.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.730
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a guy that looks like an Asian Harry Potter.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.450
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not this guy, but that's funny.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.752
[SPEAKER_14]: And then third place was Black Lab of Team P.O.P.

10:57.292 --> 11:01.093
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep wanting to say poop when I see that, except there's only one O, so it's Team Pop.

11:01.933 --> 11:20.658
[SPEAKER_14]: and fourth place was Seahop of Team and it's got all this leet speak it's GE basically so congratulations to all those people I noticed the real names of the third and fourth place winners both Ryan so if your name's Ryan you must be pretty good at Perfect Attack this is only a Perfect Attack tournament no freestyle it was just a mini tournament so congratulations to

11:21.741 --> 11:24.062
[SPEAKER_14]: All those of you that placed or participated in that tournament.

11:24.083 --> 11:24.903
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like a fun time.

11:25.163 --> 11:25.904
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have gone out there.

11:25.924 --> 11:30.506
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I vaguely heard about it, but I didn't know it was this soon.

11:30.526 --> 11:31.547
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was a ways away.

11:31.667 --> 11:32.347
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoops, my bad.

11:33.228 --> 11:35.369
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, oh, I'm being yelled at in the chat room, Team Pop.

11:38.451 --> 11:41.733
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to say hi to Tal because he'll beat me up if I don't.

11:41.813 --> 11:42.274
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

11:42.294 --> 11:43.094
[SPEAKER_14]: Why aren't you here?

11:43.434 --> 11:44.235
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my question.

11:44.435 --> 11:46.116
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, you didn't get to whore the mic.

11:46.356 --> 11:47.757
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you didn't get to whore the mic tonight.

11:48.798 --> 11:51.199
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks to Black Lab for giving me that link.

11:51.239 --> 11:53.421
[SPEAKER_14]: And he wants everybody to know that he beat Tigger.

11:53.661 --> 11:54.361
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

11:57.664 --> 11:58.024
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

11:58.264 --> 11:58.664
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

11:59.765 --> 12:01.266
[SPEAKER_14]: Tigger is somebody's online name.

12:01.326 --> 12:04.148
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like a euphemism for your private parts like it is for your bread.

12:08.496 --> 12:09.358
[SPEAKER_14]: Bounce, bounce, what?

12:12.926 --> 12:18.658
[SPEAKER_15]: Bap, bap, tigger, hey, tigger Okay, that was, yeah

12:19.886 --> 12:21.507
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Rob, how about the weather?

12:21.768 --> 12:22.468
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, how about it?

12:22.528 --> 12:22.908
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

12:22.948 --> 12:24.830
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take care of some housekeeping.

12:25.290 --> 12:26.230
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you.

12:26.871 --> 12:27.831
[SPEAKER_14]: No, thank you.

12:29.492 --> 12:31.874
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to make a correction to last week.

12:31.954 --> 12:35.837
[SPEAKER_14]: We debuted on the show some new 8th style MP3s.

12:36.337 --> 12:37.438
[SPEAKER_14]: You might have heard this one.

12:37.498 --> 12:39.079
[SPEAKER_14]: We played M for you.

12:39.099 --> 12:41.900
[SPEAKER_14]: Crap!

12:41.940 --> 12:42.561
[SPEAKER_14]: Crap!

12:43.379 --> 12:44.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what?

12:45.440 --> 12:46.361
[SPEAKER_14]: They're fake anyway.

12:46.421 --> 12:47.921
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we just found out during the week.

12:48.062 --> 12:52.604
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not confirmed that they're fake, but let's just say it's not confirmed that they're real either.

12:53.084 --> 12:55.886
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually took a really good listen to them outside.

12:55.946 --> 13:02.669
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, obviously, to suit all you modem users who are listening to this show, we have to downcode the show a lot, so you can't really hear the instruments as clear as we can.

13:03.109 --> 13:07.712
[SPEAKER_14]: We really listened to that, and it doesn't quite sound like it came off a Beatmania machine.

13:08.504 --> 13:15.072
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibility it still could be a song, but the Magic 8-Ball says all signs point to no.

13:15.392 --> 13:19.878
[SPEAKER_16]: Doesn't DJ Taka have his own website, or was that Taka?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.259
[SPEAKER_14]: Taka has his own website.

13:21.279 --> 13:22.481
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe Taka does.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.525
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like a freaking pushpin anyway.

13:26.946 --> 13:27.586
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't matter.

13:27.646 --> 13:28.967
[SPEAKER_16]: That song sucks ass.

13:28.987 --> 13:29.967
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope it's not real.

13:29.987 --> 13:36.109
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope no actual artist that would be featured on any Bimani would make that piece of shit.

13:36.489 --> 13:36.949
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

13:37.069 --> 13:37.450
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

13:38.010 --> 13:39.670
[SPEAKER_16]: Then again, there's Crash.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.111
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, as long as Crash exists, who knows?

13:43.151 --> 13:43.732
[SPEAKER_14]: Breakdown!

13:46.112 --> 13:46.793
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do we want to say?

13:46.873 --> 13:47.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, next week's show.

13:48.433 --> 13:52.134
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't told anybody in here the plan for next week's show, but I did talk about it with Jamie.

13:53.075 --> 13:53.795
[SPEAKER_14]: Next week's show...

13:55.302 --> 13:56.443
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:22.193 --> 14:24.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Patron harassing will be encouraged

14:43.044 --> 14:43.904
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you next time.

15:10.636 --> 15:12.657
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't care one bit.

15:12.897 --> 15:15.938
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other plans for what you guys want to do on Wednesday over at Golf One?

15:16.378 --> 15:18.619
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be bringing, yes, I'm very obsessed.

15:18.739 --> 15:24.201
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be bringing my mobile editing computer with me for edits.

15:24.361 --> 15:25.522
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to kill people with your edits.

15:25.662 --> 15:29.403
[SPEAKER_14]: I finished, by the way, tell people, you know, this is a national show.

15:29.423 --> 15:30.724
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got people all over the U.S.

15:30.744 --> 15:31.424
[SPEAKER_14]: who are participating.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.305
[SPEAKER_14]: So not everybody's going to be able to participate in this.

15:33.345 --> 15:37.286
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe for some of the Bay Area local people, tell everybody about your edit contest coming up.

15:37.466 --> 15:38.947
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well I have an edit contest.

15:39.287 --> 15:41.489
[SPEAKER_16]: Normally, I've been posting on the Sakamani boards.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.230
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, the edits fall in two categories.

15:44.250 --> 15:48.613
[SPEAKER_16]: You have freestyle, and then you have hell edits, or really fucking hard edits.

15:49.434 --> 15:54.857
[SPEAKER_16]: And, because I work at a video distribution company, normally prizes are a whole bunch of DVDs.

15:55.438 --> 15:57.559
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can say this much, that...

15:58.199 --> 15:59.620
[SPEAKER_14]: I won the last edit contest.

15:59.660 --> 16:00.500
[SPEAKER_14]: I won the freestyle portion.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.581
[SPEAKER_14]: I literally must have gotten hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.641
[SPEAKER_14]: So much stuff.

16:05.142 --> 16:05.522
[SPEAKER_14]: Insane.

16:05.822 --> 16:06.102
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

16:06.202 --> 16:08.483
[SPEAKER_14]: And like screeners of stuff that wasn't even released yet.

16:08.963 --> 16:11.044
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw American Psycho 2 before any of you.

16:12.424 --> 16:13.005
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't watch it.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.845
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't look good.

16:15.125 --> 16:15.665
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have it.

16:15.685 --> 16:16.966
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it really sucks.

16:16.986 --> 16:17.466
[SPEAKER_14]: And you don't.

16:17.986 --> 16:20.147
[SPEAKER_16]: But tons of anime DVDs for sure.

16:20.667 --> 16:24.709
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that first place is going to get Lord of the Rings and both Austin Powers movies.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.371
[SPEAKER_16]: That's for sure.

16:27.751 --> 16:29.853
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I just have both.

16:29.893 --> 16:30.694
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a bunch of crap.

16:30.734 --> 16:31.554
[SPEAKER_14]: It's worth a second.

16:31.855 --> 16:34.577
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes, what, a half hour to make a decent edit, maybe?

16:35.038 --> 16:35.398
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

16:35.598 --> 16:36.939
[SPEAKER_16]: Just nothing to enter.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.341
[SPEAKER_16]: It's totally free to enter.

16:38.361 --> 16:39.562
[SPEAKER_16]: You just have to be there.

16:40.583 --> 16:46.808
[SPEAKER_16]: At some point, I was trying to do it where I could have people submit edits online to me, but that got to be too confusing.

16:46.868 --> 16:47.529
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's not fair.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.069
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got to be there.

16:48.089 --> 16:48.870
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got to be there in person.

16:48.890 --> 16:50.692
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to be down at Sunsplash in order to enter.

16:51.413 --> 16:52.574
[SPEAKER_16]: and yeah, that's about it.

16:53.035 --> 16:53.355
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

16:53.876 --> 16:55.178
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to give you a free plug for that.

16:55.278 --> 17:02.367
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, this time around, hopefully, since I've got that nice little laptop and hopefully everything works, I haven't gotten them set up yet, I'll be able to copy that.

17:02.407 --> 17:06.393
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from people's cards and actually be able to post them on the internet when I'm done.

17:06.593 --> 17:12.516
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I finished my hell edit today, so those that saw it, don't say anything about it, but it's going to be good, I think.

17:12.716 --> 17:16.218
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to stroke my own ego here, but I think you'll like it.

17:16.558 --> 17:24.062
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, speaking of edits, my edits are now on the SoCalKicks website, www.socalkicks.com.

17:24.722 --> 17:27.743
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, maybe we can get the winners of the contest, get all those edits.

17:27.783 --> 17:32.906
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if we kiss enough ass with SoCalKicks, he'll put all those edits up for us.

17:33.066 --> 17:33.386
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

17:33.686 --> 17:34.046
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure.

17:35.507 --> 17:37.008
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be sending them some more at some point.

17:37.568 --> 17:37.908
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

17:40.269 --> 17:41.009
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't play the stuff that sucks!

18:09.838 --> 18:13.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, we already voted the worst Vimani song in history on this program.

18:13.502 --> 18:15.224
[SPEAKER_14]: Next to Let Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

18:15.585 --> 18:18.548
[SPEAKER_14]: You will never, ever hear that song on our playlist.

18:18.588 --> 18:20.090
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're only playing the good stuff.

18:21.122 --> 18:29.686
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have any requests, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com I've been getting a few new remixes here and there, some mixed things.

18:30.306 --> 18:32.347
[SPEAKER_14]: I might play one of those later in the show.

18:32.387 --> 18:34.788
[SPEAKER_14]: Towards the end of the show, I got one during the week.

18:34.848 --> 18:35.709
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very interesting.

18:35.749 --> 18:38.690
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a hybrid of two songs that you wouldn't imagine together.

18:38.790 --> 18:41.011
[SPEAKER_14]: So we might play that towards the end of the show if we've got some time.

18:41.451 --> 18:50.419
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have any fan remixes, go ahead and email me about sending those to me at OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and Jamie and I will look them over and maybe we'll go ahead and put them in our playlist.

18:50.699 --> 18:54.402
[SPEAKER_14]: But I ask that they be, you know, kind of remixed a lot.

18:54.522 --> 18:59.026
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, don't just, you know, re-loop the song in a sound editor, take clips.

18:59.066 --> 19:07.253
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm adding, like, you know, put some new instruments in there, take some vocals, do new things with it, kind of remix it a little more than just, you know, a five-second remixing job.

19:08.414 --> 19:08.514
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

19:10.310 --> 19:11.090
[SPEAKER_14]: What else did I want to say?

19:11.130 --> 19:13.651
[SPEAKER_14]: There was something... I don't know.

19:13.791 --> 19:14.031
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

19:15.132 --> 19:16.032
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't make notes.

19:16.292 --> 19:16.952
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are my notes?

19:17.192 --> 19:17.973
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have some notes.

19:18.053 --> 19:18.373
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

19:20.093 --> 19:24.175
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say... I wanted to say something else about... Something they could email me about.

19:24.495 --> 19:25.815
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they paying you for, Rob?

19:26.335 --> 19:27.336
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't get paid for this.

19:27.496 --> 19:28.176
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that crazy?

19:28.656 --> 19:29.576
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't get paid for this.

19:29.596 --> 19:30.437
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that a travesty?

19:30.457 --> 19:31.017
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my money?

19:32.990 --> 19:36.352
[SPEAKER_14]: There was something else that I was going to say they could email me about.

19:36.933 --> 19:37.393
[SPEAKER_16]: Ice cream?

19:37.854 --> 19:38.434
[SPEAKER_14]: Requests.

19:38.474 --> 19:39.735
[SPEAKER_14]: You can always email your requests.

19:39.775 --> 19:47.000
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's a song that you're not hearing in the Bomani Musical More program or on this show, you can always email us your requests and we'll get those to you as well.

19:47.320 --> 19:47.681
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll think of it.

19:47.701 --> 19:48.381
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll come to me later.

19:48.401 --> 19:51.383
[SPEAKER_16]: Could it be songs that you'd like to hear in Bomani Musical More?

19:51.403 --> 19:51.563
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

19:51.604 --> 19:52.004
[SPEAKER_14]: Requests.

19:52.144 --> 19:52.324
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

19:53.005 --> 19:53.345
[SPEAKER_14]: Requests.

19:54.085 --> 19:54.386
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

19:54.526 --> 19:54.746
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh well.

19:55.891 --> 19:57.292
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:24.716 --> 20:25.277
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt's F.U.

20:25.297 --> 20:26.178
[SPEAKER_14]: music is much better.

20:26.698 --> 20:27.098
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

20:27.139 --> 20:28.240
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt's F.U.

20:28.260 --> 20:28.960
[SPEAKER_14]: music is much better.

20:28.980 --> 20:29.621
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll like this.

20:30.502 --> 20:31.263
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll like this, Brad.

20:33.925 --> 20:35.247
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, now you can do your F.U.

20:35.307 --> 20:36.328
[SPEAKER_14]: of the week.

20:36.788 --> 20:38.950
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate this fucking music!

20:39.291 --> 20:39.611
[SPEAKER_14]: See?

20:39.931 --> 20:40.192
[SPEAKER_13]: See?

20:42.354 --> 20:43.235
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes him angry!

20:44.660 --> 20:51.267
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, my FQ of the week has to go to Kaiser for renting out RVGL for the last three days.

20:52.208 --> 20:52.888
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

20:53.089 --> 20:56.932
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've seen company parties last, you know, a day or something, but why three days?

20:57.093 --> 21:00.516
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it seems a little... I can tell you why.

21:00.576 --> 21:01.737
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to work for Kaiser.

21:01.777 --> 21:04.380
[SPEAKER_08]: Their ass holes.

21:05.381 --> 21:05.821
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you!

21:07.378 --> 21:08.500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, they're not assholes.

21:08.540 --> 21:08.960
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

21:09.141 --> 21:10.222
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know anybody personally there.

21:10.262 --> 21:12.946
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, they're rich enough because they're doctors and shit.

21:12.966 --> 21:16.370
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's why they can... The only reason why they do it is because they can afford to.

21:16.390 --> 21:16.611
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

21:16.631 --> 21:16.851
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

21:20.523 --> 21:22.764
[SPEAKER_15]: The point is, what do they have to do at RBGL?

21:22.985 --> 21:25.186
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they're not playing DDR, are they?

21:25.206 --> 21:36.033
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm imagining some physician, like, trying DDR or Drum Mania or something, and he's like, whoa, rock out, yeah, you know, like, reliving his youth because he's bald and, you know.

21:36.313 --> 21:37.574
[SPEAKER_15]: I broke my fibula.

21:39.035 --> 21:39.716
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

21:40.256 --> 21:42.557
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're doing research or something, I don't know.

21:44.979 --> 21:45.880
[SPEAKER_07]: For three days.

21:46.220 --> 21:49.162
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe they're just too stupid and, you know, just...

21:49.915 --> 21:53.378
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know when I want to go down and party, so we're just going to leave the weekend open.

21:53.939 --> 21:54.619
[SPEAKER_16]: Leave it open.

21:54.659 --> 21:58.262
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I can say that also the folks that work at Kaiser work some pretty effed up schedules.

21:58.282 --> 22:00.905
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I have a friend that works there who's working at 11.30 tonight.

22:01.325 --> 22:06.069
[SPEAKER_14]: So imagine, you know, if they were only doing it for one day and you had to work, you know, that would kind of suck.

22:06.690 --> 22:07.931
[SPEAKER_14]: So two days, but three days.

22:08.431 --> 22:14.457
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the weekend, not only any weekend, but the weekend before school starts for most people, if it hasn't started already, it's kind of...

22:15.399 --> 22:18.442
[SPEAKER_14]: What a bunch of bitches.

22:18.482 --> 22:19.903
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom actually works for Kaiser.

22:20.383 --> 22:24.047
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get to see my mom for long stretches of time because I decide to go out in the daytime.

22:24.367 --> 22:29.852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when she's asleep because she works like 2.30 to 11 at night and then weekends too.

22:30.052 --> 22:33.775
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, okay, hi mom, bye mom, see you later, walk by.

22:33.795 --> 22:35.457
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be kind of screwed up.

22:35.957 --> 22:40.178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like when dogs pee-pee on trees and stuff.

22:40.198 --> 22:41.058
[SPEAKER_08]: They're marking their territory.

22:41.078 --> 22:42.419
[SPEAKER_08]: They're showing their power.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.159
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Kaiser's doing right now.

22:46.059 --> 22:47.200
[SPEAKER_15]: They're showing their power.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.200
[SPEAKER_15]: They're peeing on our DDR machine?

22:49.360 --> 22:50.941
[SPEAKER_15]: If they do, I'm going to kick their ass.

22:50.961 --> 22:51.661
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

22:51.841 --> 22:52.781
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to die.

22:52.801 --> 22:57.742
[SPEAKER_15]: No health insurance can bring them back from the dead that I'll take them to or something like that.

22:58.822 --> 22:59.663
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody help me, quick.

23:00.723 --> 23:02.383
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell them to do it somewhere else.

23:03.464 --> 23:04.684
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like on the Parapara machine.

23:04.784 --> 23:05.044
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

23:06.110 --> 23:08.011
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, that's what CCL's for, okay?

23:08.351 --> 23:10.713
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I play there.

23:11.433 --> 23:16.436
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, one time, I was at Sunnyvale Golf Line, and I think somebody seriously peed behind the 2DX machine.

23:17.437 --> 23:17.617
[SPEAKER_14]: Ew.

23:18.577 --> 23:20.718
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it does smell there.

23:21.319 --> 23:21.739
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty bad.

23:21.799 --> 23:25.381
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, I think that's just because the bathroom's right next to one of the GDR machines.

23:25.401 --> 23:26.442
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it is there anymore, but...

23:28.194 --> 23:34.322
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways, yeah, what I wanted to say is that sucked because I couldn't go down and play DDR down there all weekend long.

23:34.402 --> 23:38.588
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I could understand missing out one day, but I haven't played in like a couple weeks.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.809
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm starting to feel like drolls.

23:40.911 --> 23:43.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop that goddamn song!

23:44.355 --> 23:45.176
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that thing!

23:47.662 --> 23:49.303
[SPEAKER_15]: Kaiser steals your soul.

23:50.284 --> 23:51.625
[SPEAKER_15]: We are Kaiser!

23:52.906 --> 23:53.827
[SPEAKER_15]: Kaiser Wave!

23:53.987 --> 23:55.168
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't have that mic off, did you?

23:55.468 --> 23:55.649
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

23:55.829 --> 23:57.690
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, don't turn it off, because they'll turn them both off.

23:57.991 --> 23:59.192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I didn't.

23:59.212 --> 24:00.733
[SPEAKER_14]: Just checking, just checking.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.496
[SPEAKER_14]: We got some FUs from the chatroom that would like to be shared with all of you out there.

24:04.536 --> 24:09.060
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to join our chatroom, you're just going to join any other side IRC server.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.863
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of the servers in your list, if you have MIRC, that's in your list.

24:13.543 --> 24:20.730
[SPEAKER_14]: One example server you could join would be irc.eggheads.org, and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

24:21.030 --> 24:32.239
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is the same server, by the way, as most of the big Bomani channels, DDR Freak, 2DX Style, DDR Spot, all have their chat rooms over on other side IRC, and we do as well, Orange Lounge.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.922
[SPEAKER_14]: Some FUs from the chat room, SoCalKicks says...

24:35.442 --> 24:56.842
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck Pepsi Blue because it fucked up the camera that he borrowed from his friend And I guess what he did is there's some kind of, it has a crappy cap on it he says That I guess must have went flying and conked the camera in just the right way That one of the lines, the LED lines, doesn't work And now he's in deep poopy So fuck you Pepsi Blue from SoCalKicks

24:58.848 --> 25:05.617
[SPEAKER_14]: A big fuck you from Black Lab to A Minute Extended Mix because it's the song that he lost to on PA Competition.

25:06.078 --> 25:07.580
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck that song.

25:08.982 --> 25:11.505
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it only takes a minute, girl, for Max 2.

25:11.726 --> 25:11.926
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

25:15.211 --> 25:16.672
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's what it's called.

25:16.732 --> 25:17.773
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the extended mix.

25:17.853 --> 25:18.233
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

25:18.373 --> 25:18.974
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up, Brad.

25:19.494 --> 25:19.754
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

25:21.095 --> 25:22.236
[SPEAKER_14]: Another F you.

25:22.916 --> 25:30.141
[SPEAKER_14]: Idiots who get balloons and suck the helium out and get on the second pad and talk with that weird helium voice when I'm doing a cat-up.

25:31.763 --> 25:33.063
[SPEAKER_14]: That's from Twin316.

25:33.564 --> 25:36.066
[SPEAKER_14]: I myself would find that quite humorous, actually.

25:38.210 --> 25:43.953
[SPEAKER_14]: Catas, it's kind of, you know, DDR, I have to say, it's getting a little repetitive, you know, it's getting a little boring.

25:44.633 --> 25:49.016
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when the modifiers won't shuffle it up enough, you know, get somebody on there to talk with Helium.

25:49.036 --> 25:50.116
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have that kind of modifier.

25:50.136 --> 25:51.277
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an idea for Wednesday.

25:51.357 --> 25:52.037
[SPEAKER_14]: Write that down.

25:56.239 --> 25:58.200
[SPEAKER_16]: The announcer starts speaking like he has a Helium voice.

25:58.220 --> 25:58.600
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

25:58.620 --> 26:03.403
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be funny, like, you know, some sort of modifiers that get the announcer to make fun of you.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.683
[SPEAKER_16]: God, you fucking suck.

26:04.703 --> 26:05.864
[SPEAKER_16]: Get out the damn pad.

26:06.496 --> 26:08.717
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, what are you doing on the stage, you crack whore?

26:09.458 --> 26:11.820
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't even put your money in, you're gonna fail anyway!

26:12.080 --> 26:13.240
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you even get on the machine.

26:16.102 --> 26:25.929
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me, um, we borrowed a... I just recently acquired a JPS2 and got a copy of DDR Max that is very scratched up, so...

26:26.667 --> 26:28.788
[SPEAKER_05]: You go and you choose a song, it's already booing you.

26:29.268 --> 26:32.709
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't even taken one step, and it's already saying, 400 combo!

26:32.729 --> 26:33.970
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's the Roseville-Golfland mix!

26:34.970 --> 26:37.131
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even take a step and say, 400 combo!

26:37.171 --> 26:40.392
[SPEAKER_05]: Mel had a combo of about 300, and it started booing him out of nowhere.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.093
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

26:41.453 --> 26:44.354
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like The Exorcist meets DDR or something.

26:45.394 --> 26:48.375
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it vomit pea soup if you get a certain combo?

26:49.216 --> 26:51.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe out of the memory card slot, I didn't try that.

26:52.297 --> 26:52.357
[SPEAKER_10]: Eww!

26:54.409 --> 26:56.431
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe for a 666 combo?

26:57.292 --> 27:00.035
[SPEAKER_16]: There was vomit coming out of the slot.

27:00.235 --> 27:00.876
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, anyways.

27:03.639 --> 27:05.160
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that would be pretty funny.

27:05.240 --> 27:12.347
[SPEAKER_16]: Or even a great prank would be to hook up some sort of, I don't know, a microphone or something to the actual speakers.

27:12.427 --> 27:15.851
[SPEAKER_16]: And just when people are going in to put in money, you start yelling through their remote mic, say...

27:17.108 --> 27:20.710
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, from the upper balcony from Sunsplash, you know, to shell them down.

27:21.030 --> 27:21.631
[SPEAKER_16]: You suck!

27:21.851 --> 27:22.571
[SPEAKER_16]: Get off the stage!

27:22.591 --> 27:23.352
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're like, what the hell?

27:23.372 --> 27:24.733
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we can just do that from the balcony.

27:24.753 --> 27:25.513
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need a microphone.

27:26.694 --> 27:36.239
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but... No, that brings up an idea, though, that I thought about when they had a for Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania session is to have a microphone slot so you can do karaoke with them while they're playing.

27:37.500 --> 27:41.683
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, I wouldn't try to sing because I already know I suck, so... But, um, Rob's really good.

27:42.043 --> 27:43.304
[SPEAKER_15]: We should play one of your songs, Rob.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.465
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we shouldn't!

27:47.834 --> 27:52.415
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm, um, SoCalKicks in the chat room is being an attention whore and he's whining that I'm not.

27:52.715 --> 27:54.835
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't do his second part of his FU of the week.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.336
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's his second part of the FU week.

27:56.836 --> 28:02.077
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, uh, fuck you to Echo for making $58 pants and $38 shirts.

28:02.457 --> 28:04.217
[SPEAKER_14]: He spent $270 there yesterday.

28:04.577 --> 28:06.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if it bothers you, why did you spend $270?

28:07.338 --> 28:08.278
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I don't get.

28:08.898 --> 28:10.839
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to Walmart and get $14 jeans.

28:10.979 --> 28:12.119
[SPEAKER_15]: Ross, that's what I'm saying, dude.

28:12.179 --> 28:12.819
[SPEAKER_15]: Ross, Target.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.839
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm styling.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.300
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm representing when I'm wearing my, uh,

28:19.284 --> 28:20.524
[SPEAKER_05]: Kmart has Joe Boxer's now.

28:20.804 --> 28:21.525
[SPEAKER_15]: Sweet.

28:22.305 --> 28:23.705
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how you impress the ladies.

28:23.925 --> 28:24.525
[SPEAKER_15]: Joe Boxer.

28:24.685 --> 28:25.065
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me.

28:25.946 --> 28:26.366
[SPEAKER_15]: Just look at me.

28:27.406 --> 28:31.427
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tal gives a big F you to Guitar Freaks.

28:33.287 --> 28:34.708
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's been broken for a few weeks.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.689
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've got all the F yous.

28:42.848 --> 28:43.468
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an F.U.

28:43.648 --> 28:45.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

28:45.249 --> 28:47.129
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you're a special guest, you get a song.

28:47.530 --> 28:48.410
[SPEAKER_14]: You get a song, too.

28:48.450 --> 28:49.310
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to find a song.

28:49.930 --> 28:50.350
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.571
[SPEAKER_14]: We've already done Petite Love for Somebody.

28:51.591 --> 28:51.931
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

28:53.211 --> 28:53.471
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

28:53.491 --> 28:54.092
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I think?

28:56.712 --> 28:57.573
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you know what?

28:57.813 --> 28:58.473
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'll give you?

29:01.034 --> 29:02.054
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to give you Like a Virgin.

29:03.114 --> 29:04.075
[SPEAKER_05]: You are such a liar.

29:06.295 --> 29:07.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who knows me knows this is a trick.

29:09.629 --> 29:14.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my FU of the week is to Santana Row in San Jose.

29:15.178 --> 29:19.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who's in the Bay Area knows Santana Row is this gigantic complex.

29:20.466 --> 29:23.651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be housing and shopping and all this shit.

29:24.614 --> 29:25.835
[SPEAKER_05]: It burned down.

29:26.395 --> 29:34.121
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to see this giant Santana Row opening September 19th with it in major flames in the background.

29:34.141 --> 29:37.203
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking 11 alarms, biggest fire in San Jose's history.

29:37.723 --> 29:39.284
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the reason why this is an FU of the week?

29:39.685 --> 29:42.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I found out they were going to be charging for these condos.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they have condos in there?

29:45.389 --> 29:46.109
[SPEAKER_05]: $15,000 a month.

29:46.509 --> 29:50.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has that kind of money for a freaking condo every month?

29:50.922 --> 29:51.562
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

29:51.662 --> 29:52.983
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel bad for them anymore.

29:53.003 --> 29:58.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if they can find that kind of money to be charging for a condo, they damn it, they deserve it to be burned down.

29:59.445 --> 30:00.425
[SPEAKER_16]: Preach on, sister.

30:01.645 --> 30:03.626
[SPEAKER_16]: What, they have like golden toilets in there or something?

30:03.646 --> 30:05.106
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell?

30:10.529 --> 30:15.073
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're going to go to a quick break and we'll come back and talk about some more things.

30:15.093 --> 30:21.098
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk about USA's going bye-bye, being replaced with some new machines locally.

30:21.539 --> 30:23.681
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll talk about that coming back from break.

30:24.061 --> 30:25.842
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to do a request this break.

30:25.863 --> 30:29.145
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a request I said I'd do last week and I didn't, so my bad.

30:30.687 --> 30:32.148
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it this week, tonight.

30:32.668 --> 30:34.370
[SPEAKER_14]: One other thing I did want to say before we go to break.

30:35.190 --> 30:36.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

30:53.769 --> 30:54.790
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't know what day.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Sunday, maybe not.

30:57.192 --> 30:58.333
[SPEAKER_14]: You're kicking something there, sweetie.

30:58.593 --> 30:58.793
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you?

30:59.114 --> 30:59.374
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no?

30:59.514 --> 30:59.854
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

31:00.435 --> 31:04.778
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just making sure that wasn't the router because then the show would have just gone bye-bye.

31:05.138 --> 31:10.102
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, yeah, I will be out doing some interviews at some of the Bay Area golf lands.

31:10.143 --> 31:13.325
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't know where and I don't know when just yet, but it will be sometime next weekend.

31:13.906 --> 31:17.729
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll post an announcement somewhere appropriate when I know more about where I'm going to be.

31:18.229 --> 31:21.212
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I run into you, I just might interview you for this program.

31:22.213 --> 31:22.933
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

31:47.062 --> 32:05.628
[SPEAKER_19]: Dreamer, dreamer, take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please, boy, you're making me scream Dreamer, dreamer, love and life is just a dream If you wanna set me free, boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da Take me anywhere you please, boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

33:05.177 --> 33:06.238
Thank you for watching!

33:52.012 --> 33:53.033
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

36:50.925 --> 36:56.733
[SPEAKER_30]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

37:01.471 --> 37:04.554
[SPEAKER_14]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, or at least most of you were.

37:04.654 --> 37:08.857
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just hearing in the chat room that there was a dump, and most of you got dumped.

37:08.937 --> 37:15.623
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can tell that most of you got dumped because my listener count updated, and there's a whopping one person listening at this very moment.

37:16.584 --> 37:17.465
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's probably me.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.125
[SPEAKER_14]: It must count me.

37:18.185 --> 37:19.466
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, one person.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.327
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you, one listener.

37:20.688 --> 37:21.628
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what happened.

37:21.668 --> 37:25.672
[SPEAKER_14]: Live365 must have taken a dump or something, and you all got dumped as a result of it.

37:25.752 --> 37:26.813
[SPEAKER_14]: So I apologize.

37:28.414 --> 37:33.477
[SPEAKER_14]: But it sounds like if y'all reconnect, of course, obviously if you're hearing this, you did reconnect, so there's no point in me saying.

37:33.977 --> 37:37.959
[SPEAKER_14]: So tell anyone who was listening and got dumped that you gotta reconnect, and sorry about that.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.942
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, let's see.

37:41.962 --> 37:42.862
[SPEAKER_14]: SoCalKicks is the one.

37:42.922 --> 37:44.383
[SPEAKER_14]: SoCalKicks says he's the one listener.

37:44.443 --> 37:47.725
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know though, it updated, and then he said he got dumped, so I don't know.

37:47.785 --> 37:49.726
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one person managed to stay connected and...

37:50.296 --> 37:52.798
[SPEAKER_14]: The other ones that we had on there dropped, so I don't know.

37:52.818 --> 37:53.378
[SPEAKER_14]: That's crazy.

37:54.179 --> 37:55.620
[SPEAKER_14]: You said you had to take a dump during the break.

37:55.660 --> 37:58.102
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know it was like that.

37:58.222 --> 37:58.663
[SPEAKER_14]: Not like that.

37:58.703 --> 37:59.643
[SPEAKER_14]: High mouth humor.

37:59.884 --> 38:02.666
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been trying to make some new promos for you.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.087
[SPEAKER_14]: You like the Captain Jack one?

38:04.367 --> 38:04.968
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

38:05.008 --> 38:06.709
[SPEAKER_14]: The melody about Peter Pan's on there, that's good.

38:08.453 --> 38:08.693
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

38:10.075 --> 38:11.516
[SPEAKER_14]: What, when Melody soils herself?

38:11.836 --> 38:12.457
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

38:12.537 --> 38:14.799
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, it's good that she liked it so much.

38:14.859 --> 38:17.741
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, you know, if she peed her pants, that wouldn't really be a good thing.

38:17.761 --> 38:19.082
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to, you know, clean the carpet.

38:20.664 --> 38:21.765
[SPEAKER_14]: It's smell in here.

38:25.949 --> 38:27.350
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we go one night without potty humor?

38:27.370 --> 38:27.410
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

38:28.851 --> 38:29.312
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.267
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's leaving.

38:36.709 --> 38:36.969
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

38:38.090 --> 38:39.152
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing we wanted to talk about.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.034
[SPEAKER_14]: Some news that we got this week.

38:44.361 --> 39:00.966
[SPEAKER_14]: At the Golfland chain, which is a pretty big chain out here in the west coast of arcades in California and Arizona, where one could argue that DDR was kind of born and nurtured between the Golflands and the Metreon and some other locations like Arcade Infinity.

39:01.306 --> 39:05.387
[SPEAKER_14]: Golfland is one of the big players in getting DDR exposure.

39:07.667 --> 39:11.889
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of their arcades have a Dance Dance Revolution USA machine and then some other kind of mix.

39:11.929 --> 39:13.509
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of them have Max 2 by now, I believe.

39:14.572 --> 39:21.135
[SPEAKER_14]: The news came over this week, and this still should be considered a rumor until these machines are actually there and in place.

39:21.295 --> 39:23.937
[SPEAKER_14]: But for all practical purposes, it's pretty much been confirmed.

39:24.397 --> 39:28.319
[SPEAKER_14]: All the USAs are going out and being replaced with 4th Plus machines.

39:29.219 --> 39:33.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is good news, because 4th Plus is a very cool mix.

39:33.721 --> 39:35.502
[SPEAKER_14]: It's much better than USA, that's for sure.

39:36.042 --> 39:36.743
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, man.

39:37.283 --> 39:38.003
[SPEAKER_14]: I like USA.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.805
[SPEAKER_14]: You like your one-foot songs, one-foot freestyles, huh?

39:40.925 --> 39:42.205
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, what am I going to do now?

39:42.646 --> 39:43.386
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't play anything...

39:43.885 --> 39:46.808
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, what am I going to do?

39:48.189 --> 39:48.909
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm screwed.

39:50.451 --> 39:52.773
[SPEAKER_14]: Play Beul over and over.

39:53.653 --> 39:56.256
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean that El Remo Tropical is going to finally get a rest?

39:56.356 --> 39:58.698
[SPEAKER_05]: That they don't just hit the first song that they see?

39:58.718 --> 40:01.720
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because if you... We found this out when we had Fourth Mix.

40:01.780 --> 40:05.523
[SPEAKER_14]: If you just keep hitting the first category that's up, have you never been mellow?

40:06.885 --> 40:08.146
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like the old days.

40:10.147 --> 40:10.388
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

40:13.091 --> 40:16.137
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently 4th Plus bootleg kits are only like $200.

40:16.177 --> 40:17.500
[SPEAKER_14]: If even that, $175 I'm being told in the chat room.

40:20.646 --> 40:22.406
[SPEAKER_14]: So, pretty darn cheap.

40:22.446 --> 40:24.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

40:25.827 --> 40:26.627
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think this means?

40:26.647 --> 40:29.708
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very interesting that USA is kind of disappearing.

40:29.728 --> 40:33.749
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's always been this kind of urban legend, urban Bomani legend.

40:33.769 --> 40:35.289
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there's any truth to it personally.

40:35.329 --> 40:44.431
[SPEAKER_14]: But they've always kind of said that, oh well, Konami doesn't really mind the Max 2s and the import mixes as long as they keep the USA machine there too.

40:44.511 --> 40:46.452
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they're kind of supporting the USA Bomani.

40:47.577 --> 40:48.838
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, look at Stockton Golf Land.

40:48.858 --> 40:50.139
[SPEAKER_14]: They never had a USA machine.

40:50.179 --> 40:50.720
[SPEAKER_15]: No, very true.

40:50.960 --> 40:51.480
[SPEAKER_15]: Import machines.

40:51.921 --> 40:54.483
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I think it was all just kind of hearsay.

40:54.523 --> 40:55.544
[SPEAKER_14]: But you look at the Metreon.

40:55.964 --> 40:57.686
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not allowed to have anything but USA machines.

40:58.046 --> 41:03.230
[SPEAKER_14]: You can argue the movie theater upstairs has two Max 2s now, but they're not owned by the rest of the Metreon.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.612
[SPEAKER_14]: They're leased or whatever, so they don't have to play by those rules.

41:07.094 --> 41:07.794
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I think about it?

41:09.042 --> 41:09.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Bullshit!

41:10.163 --> 41:13.564
[SPEAKER_14]: What, the bullshit that they had to have a USA for an import?

41:14.085 --> 41:18.627
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone else find it really odd that Konami, I mean, Max 2s, they are literally everywhere now.

41:19.087 --> 41:22.829
[SPEAKER_14]: Everywhere, there's DDR everywhere, and there's pretty much no USA machines left.

41:23.189 --> 41:29.073
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty obvious that Konami is not putting out a new USA mix anytime soon unless they do it kind of out of thin air.

41:29.133 --> 41:31.694
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be something they announce and have out on the street within a month.

41:32.817 --> 41:35.038
[SPEAKER_14]: All the new USA stuff's for the home mix.

41:35.679 --> 41:41.262
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we had all that stuff a while back about Konami closing their coin-op office and all this.

41:41.282 --> 41:44.624
[SPEAKER_14]: But that doesn't mean, you know, that doesn't mean Konami coin-op is shutting down completely.

41:44.664 --> 41:47.026
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just going to have a third-party distributor, most likely.

41:47.206 --> 41:48.006
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just put it this way.

41:48.046 --> 41:53.710
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if you put a 1.5 machine and a USA machine next to each other, it's like comparing two yoga songs.

41:54.070 --> 41:56.692
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, they're going to be a little bit different, but it's not much better.

41:56.792 --> 41:58.753
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just pretty much the same thing.

41:59.733 --> 42:00.394
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it's...

42:01.406 --> 42:02.907
[SPEAKER_16]: It just, USA sucks.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.509
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone's tired of playing it, they're like, eh.

42:04.889 --> 42:05.349
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yay.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.231
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, 20 songs I get to choose from.

42:07.431 --> 42:07.912
[SPEAKER_16]: Woohoo!

42:08.372 --> 42:08.772
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

42:09.473 --> 42:09.973
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 songs?

42:10.133 --> 42:11.935
[SPEAKER_16]: Or like, 100 and some songs?

42:13.536 --> 42:14.037
[SPEAKER_16]: 20, 100 and something.

42:14.297 --> 42:15.578
[SPEAKER_16]: Mmm, that's a tough one.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.720
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, I mean, and plus you got battle mode.

42:19.201 --> 42:19.921
[SPEAKER_16]: Battle mode's cool.

42:21.062 --> 42:24.225
[SPEAKER_08]: Although the little kids will fail faster.

42:24.645 --> 42:27.127
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, they'll get off the fucking machine so I can play.

42:27.147 --> 42:28.168
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

42:28.388 --> 42:28.629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

42:30.715 --> 42:31.436
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

42:32.417 --> 42:35.560
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this kind of weird to anyone else that Konami just doesn't seem to care?

42:35.660 --> 42:40.184
[SPEAKER_14]: That Konami of USA does not seem to care that all these Japanese mixers are coming in and taking over?

42:41.107 --> 42:46.130
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they do put out a USA Second Mix, it's going to have to be damn good, or else nobody's going to blink an eye.

42:46.370 --> 42:52.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it might not be that they don't care, but, you know, imports, sure, they're not bringing money to KOA, but they're still getting exposure to it.

42:52.713 --> 42:53.093
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

42:53.133 --> 42:54.414
[SPEAKER_05]: And bringing in the PlayStation.

42:54.514 --> 42:55.074
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

42:55.254 --> 43:04.179
[SPEAKER_05]: People in other places, like, we're used to having a million DDRs all over the place, but I'm sitting here thinking, okay, I have grandparents and family in the Midwest and Missouri.

43:04.839 --> 43:07.661
[SPEAKER_05]: If I want to go back there anytime, I'm not going to be playing DDR.

43:07.861 --> 43:11.564
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there is none within 75 miles of the town they live in.

43:11.584 --> 43:13.005
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of the bigger towns back there.

43:13.365 --> 43:15.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these people only see it on their vacation.

43:15.166 --> 43:18.068
[SPEAKER_05]: They only see it if they're going on a trip for some reason.

43:18.388 --> 43:21.791
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the option to just drive 5 minutes to a golf land and play DDR.

43:21.811 --> 43:26.214
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to see an import, but be like, hey, that's cool, and go buy it for the US PlayStation.

43:26.980 --> 43:27.581
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

43:47.806 --> 43:48.586
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just put it this way.

43:48.647 --> 43:53.071
[SPEAKER_16]: How much does it cost to license music in Japan versus how much does it cost to license music over here?

43:53.091 --> 44:00.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Very true, which is a big thing to say here, although Max is going to be pretty cool because he's got 20 new licensed songs, not in any other mix of DDR.

44:00.978 --> 44:11.448
[SPEAKER_08]: They knew that USA wasn't anything special or great or anything, and I think that they realized that all the imports are getting all the business, and they're not even going to bother because they know...

44:12.830 --> 44:14.450
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fine with all of the import stuff.

44:14.910 --> 44:19.891
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, on a somewhat related subject, we have in the chat room, Rue makes a very good point here.

44:20.251 --> 44:22.752
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it that no one ever watches the good people on Max 2?

44:22.952 --> 44:24.652
[SPEAKER_14]: They always watch the newbies on USA.

44:25.072 --> 44:30.373
[SPEAKER_14]: If you see a USA mix, like we have at Rosewood Golf, and you see a USA mix right next to a Max 2, nobody is ever watching.

44:30.393 --> 44:32.534
[SPEAKER_14]: You could be playing the hardest catastrophic on Max.

44:32.554 --> 44:35.054
[SPEAKER_14]: You could be playing Max Unlimited over on the Max 2 machine.

44:35.634 --> 44:39.555
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody right next to you is doing so many men one-footer, and they're getting a huge crowd.

44:39.655 --> 44:40.235
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is that?

44:42.083 --> 44:46.649
[SPEAKER_08]: Because no one can read the arrows, you know, if they're new to it and they're watching people doing Catastrophics.

44:47.349 --> 44:51.254
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I thought of is also, well, we all started back somewhere.

44:51.314 --> 44:55.379
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of brings us back to the nostalgia of, wow, I remember when that song was hard.

44:55.419 --> 44:56.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look what I'm doing.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.704
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people see a lot of Catastrophics.

44:59.884 --> 45:01.666
[SPEAKER_05]: There's honestly not that many newbies anymore.

45:03.571 --> 45:14.682
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just the people waiting up to go play, and so you figure, okay, the guy that's playing the catastrophic is probably going to pass this song, the next song, the song after that, whereas the newbie is probably going to fail pretty soon.

45:15.063 --> 45:16.684
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to get up to play first?

45:17.064 --> 45:22.470
[SPEAKER_14]: So you think it's kind of like an Assembling of the Wolves thing, like, let's watch them fail, you know?

45:24.042 --> 45:26.764
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, now we can throw stuff at people, but, you know.

45:26.804 --> 45:30.466
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody else at our black lab says it could be American pride.

45:30.526 --> 45:31.806
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, they see USA!

45:31.866 --> 45:35.188
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, hey, it's a red, white, and blue mix.

45:35.268 --> 45:36.409
[SPEAKER_15]: We gotta support that.

45:36.929 --> 45:44.213
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, on the next machine they put in, like on the fourth plus, they should say, fuck you American capitalist pigs on the thing, so that they don't look at them anymore.

45:44.373 --> 45:45.494
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they'll stop looking at us.

45:46.014 --> 45:46.254
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

45:47.055 --> 45:47.815
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't like the attention?

45:47.835 --> 45:48.996
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought you were an attention whore, Brad.

45:49.696 --> 45:49.936
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

45:50.497 --> 45:50.697
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

45:50.997 --> 45:51.097
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

45:51.822 --> 45:52.802
[SPEAKER_15]: Put down your microphone, Rob.

45:53.003 --> 45:53.203
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

45:53.443 --> 45:54.243
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me your microphone.

45:55.884 --> 45:57.244
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the Brad show.

45:57.584 --> 45:59.085
[SPEAKER_15]: All Brad, all the time.

45:59.385 --> 45:59.785
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

46:00.185 --> 46:01.225
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, I mean, you can join.

46:01.525 --> 46:03.866
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what they should put on the next mix of DDR?

46:04.507 --> 46:06.727
[SPEAKER_08]: I like country Weston dancing.

46:06.907 --> 46:09.248
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that'd be great.

46:09.428 --> 46:09.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

46:10.108 --> 46:11.309
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, he's got a sound clip.

46:12.209 --> 46:13.750
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's going to play something.

46:15.390 --> 46:16.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

46:16.491 --> 46:16.711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

46:18.084 --> 46:21.625
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been married long time ago Didn't we just hear this?

46:22.645 --> 46:24.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, damn it, Rob!

46:25.805 --> 46:27.186
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna burn down your trailer.

46:27.486 --> 46:28.746
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?

46:28.806 --> 46:30.646
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the all-American DDR!

46:30.706 --> 46:34.327
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Jeff Fosworthy, you might be a redneck if mix.

46:34.387 --> 46:44.268
[SPEAKER_16]: So does this version of DDR have, like, you know, parked cars on it, too?

46:44.348 --> 46:46.549
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's DDR mixed with Silent Scope.

46:47.049 --> 46:47.129
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

46:49.608 --> 47:18.929
[SPEAKER_14]: ddrmixit.com, thank you melody complete with the dancing dog that you can't fucking kill no matter what you do well they need to have in the background the guy calling out you know the square dance you know commands and stuff in the background there he's just like okay everybody, do-si-do, up, down, up, down square dance revolution yeah and don't forget you have to like beat your wife and things like that and drink and smoke too much and yeah

47:19.562 --> 47:20.662
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

47:42.149 --> 47:43.149
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what's going on.

47:43.309 --> 47:43.730
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep going.

47:44.670 --> 47:45.151
[SPEAKER_15]: On with the show.

47:46.372 --> 47:53.176
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I was playing DDR the other day, and I felt this weird tingling in my ass.

47:53.457 --> 47:59.061
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, so, Max 300 does this... Anybody?

48:01.402 --> 48:03.884
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I'm sorry, but we're trying to remedy the IRC situation.

48:03.904 --> 48:04.605
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

48:04.625 --> 48:04.765
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

48:05.740 --> 48:09.241
[SPEAKER_16]: All I know is I'm not very comfortable at this moment right now.

48:09.841 --> 48:10.442
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

48:10.462 --> 48:14.143
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you ever see that scene in Screamers where the guy's head exploded?

48:16.103 --> 48:17.724
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm having a very good time.

48:18.184 --> 48:19.104
[SPEAKER_13]: People like me.

48:23.466 --> 48:23.886
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

48:24.786 --> 48:25.626
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what I was on.

48:25.666 --> 48:27.467
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to do the other server.

48:28.719 --> 48:30.540
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, let Bradley take care of it.

48:31.180 --> 48:32.721
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Bradley work on the situation.

48:32.741 --> 48:36.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm kind of monitoring the broadcast to see if we lose our listeners again because it might be us.

48:36.543 --> 48:36.883
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

48:37.083 --> 48:37.403
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

48:37.943 --> 48:38.224
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

48:39.964 --> 48:40.925
[SPEAKER_14]: Code red, code red.

48:40.965 --> 48:41.825
[SPEAKER_14]: The building's on fire.

48:44.006 --> 48:47.788
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't reconnect to IRC outgoing, you set the building on fire.

48:47.908 --> 48:49.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's Milton from Office Space for anyone who didn't know.

48:52.003 --> 48:55.564
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been confirmed the Taliban have attacked Orange Lounge Radio.

48:58.825 --> 49:00.186
[SPEAKER_16]: Do not be afraid.

49:02.507 --> 49:05.408
[SPEAKER_14]: We got the IRC situation fixed and they're all in there laughing.

49:05.428 --> 49:06.308
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody be alert.

49:06.828 --> 49:07.368
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you alert?

49:07.989 --> 49:08.429
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm alert.

49:10.529 --> 49:11.290
[SPEAKER_05]: What is alert?

49:11.370 --> 49:12.210
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know what alert is.

49:12.551 --> 49:15.333
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what happens when shit breaks down, just everybody goes nuts here.

49:15.393 --> 49:16.654
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, I'm very alert.

49:17.595 --> 49:18.555
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, can I check your bag?

49:18.575 --> 49:25.080
[SPEAKER_14]: We knew without Jamie here tonight it would all fall apart, so just, you know, fuck the show, let's just have random quote night.

49:25.240 --> 49:28.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should all go join her with a warp core breach in Vegas.

49:28.403 --> 49:28.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Road trip!

49:31.325 --> 49:36.709
[SPEAKER_16]: Little does Jamie realize we are standing behind her as she's, as she is singing it right now.

49:37.169 --> 49:38.190
[SPEAKER_16]: Won't she be surprised?

49:39.295 --> 49:47.360
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping to get the phone thing, so I really want the phones on this show because I want to be able, I don't so much want people to be able to call us, but I want to be able to call other people.

49:47.980 --> 49:59.547
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not, I'm really skeptical with having random people call this show because there's, I mean, no offense to anybody listening because I'm sure you're all intelligent, but there's really a lot of idiots out there in the Bomani community I don't want calling this show.

50:00.568 --> 50:05.511
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just have a phone in here and put it on speaker and dial out or something?

50:06.522 --> 50:06.942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

50:07.583 --> 50:08.483
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't know.

50:08.784 --> 50:09.844
[SPEAKER_14]: It would sound kind of crappy.

50:09.864 --> 50:11.726
[SPEAKER_14]: It might work, but it would be kind of crappy.

50:12.086 --> 50:13.707
[SPEAKER_14]: But, of course, we do have two microphones.

50:13.987 --> 50:17.109
[SPEAKER_14]: The only problem is it might sound kind of weird for the person on the other end.

50:17.190 --> 50:17.610
[SPEAKER_14]: It might work.

50:17.630 --> 50:18.150
[SPEAKER_14]: We could try it.

50:18.591 --> 50:26.156
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I could maybe borrow something that I have at work that we could hook up to the phone line where you can plug it in.

50:26.376 --> 50:29.258
[SPEAKER_14]: I always like it when people want to steal things from work for the show.

50:30.399 --> 50:30.799
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

50:30.839 --> 50:31.500
[SPEAKER_14]: Long-term borrow.

50:32.020 --> 50:32.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, borrow.

50:33.141 --> 50:33.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I...

50:36.092 --> 50:37.993
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a paperclip from work.

50:38.513 --> 50:44.295
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, back on the... Our chat room is foaming at the mouth with the idea of phones.

50:44.595 --> 50:45.395
[SPEAKER_14]: Call us, call us, call us.

50:45.995 --> 50:50.157
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, yeah, we should probably be back on topic here.

50:50.317 --> 50:58.940
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, actually, something was said in the chat room that jolted... Remember that thing I was trying to think of earlier that I couldn't think of why I wanted people to email me at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com?

51:00.220 --> 51:05.502
[SPEAKER_14]: If... Some people were listening last week to our Dollar Mendy coverage of that tournament that happened a couple weeks ago.

51:06.215 --> 51:07.056
[SPEAKER_14]: www.DarkSakura.com

51:34.002 --> 51:35.723
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely tape something over there and send it to us.

51:35.743 --> 51:36.704
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd love to play it on the show.

51:36.884 --> 51:41.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Get in touch with me at OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and I'll give you all the information that you need.

51:41.147 --> 51:44.029
[SPEAKER_16]: And in the chat room, I know that you posted my edits.

51:44.109 --> 51:47.211
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, I saw that you didn't have the names on there so I sent you another email with the names.

51:47.631 --> 51:51.133
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're also in the zip files, all the information about the edits.

51:51.153 --> 51:52.054
[SPEAKER_13]: Check that out.

51:52.294 --> 51:54.355
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool, cool.

51:54.375 --> 52:01.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm still kind of going on this fourth plus thing now that we realized we haven't lost the whole damn show.

52:02.501 --> 52:02.581
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

52:03.988 --> 52:07.311
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think 4th Plus is the best choice to replace USA?

52:08.012 --> 52:08.272
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

52:08.833 --> 52:10.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's like the best mix.

52:10.674 --> 52:13.597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got like pretty much a little bit of everything.

52:13.617 --> 52:14.277
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to find...

52:15.387 --> 52:21.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the songs from other mixes before 4th on there, you know, and it doesn't have any of the crap songs on there.

52:22.830 --> 52:27.691
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, a lot of stuff that was on 5th Mix or anything like that is already on Max 2 anyway.

52:27.731 --> 52:29.372
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like most of the stuff that was good.

52:29.752 --> 52:30.932
[SPEAKER_13]: What about 5th Mix?

52:31.272 --> 52:31.773
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

52:32.533 --> 52:34.213
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, 4th Plus seems pretty good.

52:34.654 --> 52:39.655
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it probably has one of the most, you know, the largest sound collections.

52:39.675 --> 52:41.916
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're not going to miss all the 3rd Koreans that get replaced?

52:47.597 --> 52:50.338
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, only half.

52:50.478 --> 52:55.980
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the non-third-plus Korean songs like Starion, Hogism, those ones are not going to be there.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.080
[SPEAKER_16]: Those weren't in fourth anyways.

52:58.201 --> 53:00.581
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but Qua, they're there, yeah, fourth-plus.

53:00.641 --> 53:02.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, but Qua, oh yeah.

53:02.262 --> 53:06.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you just want to play Beautiful 21C over and over and over and over?

53:06.323 --> 53:07.444
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know people that do that.

53:11.265 --> 53:11.645
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.

53:11.785 --> 53:12.806
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, good point, good point.

53:13.386 --> 53:17.007
[SPEAKER_14]: Twen in the chatroom says, Fifth Mix is slightly better because it does not have Let Them Move.

53:17.714 --> 53:18.234
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

53:22.657 --> 53:26.159
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways... I don't have anything to say.

53:26.179 --> 53:27.520
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you hand me the microphone?

53:27.960 --> 53:29.061
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't ask for the microphone.

53:29.081 --> 53:35.385
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't have anything to say.

53:35.625 --> 53:38.767
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's play what is this link I'm being sent in the chatroom.

53:38.827 --> 53:42.710
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm guessing it's for an upgrade to 4th Plus and showing how expensive it is.

53:43.310 --> 53:44.030
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, no, no.

53:44.230 --> 53:46.512
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody is selling their screen name of Satan.

53:48.718 --> 53:49.199
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Lee.

53:49.500 --> 53:54.588
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's funny is that one of my good friends is Morpheus on AOL.

53:56.091 --> 53:58.555
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's had this for years and years.

53:58.615 --> 54:00.358
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, right after The Matrix came out,

54:01.030 --> 54:01.610
[SPEAKER_14]: Pound Orange Lounge

54:30.706 --> 54:32.009
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a different topic.

54:32.029 --> 54:33.452
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

54:33.472 --> 54:34.253
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to talk about?

54:34.574 --> 54:38.221
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking about another tournament here in Sacramento.

54:38.682 --> 54:39.023
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

54:39.083 --> 54:39.944
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we want to do one.

54:41.067 --> 54:42.269
[SPEAKER_08]: So when are we going to do one?

54:42.921 --> 54:44.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, when the place has let us.

54:44.762 --> 54:51.345
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some things going on at one of the local arcades is looking into getting a brand new machine.

54:51.385 --> 54:52.406
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm talking about.

54:52.446 --> 54:54.047
[SPEAKER_14]: A very wanted machine.

54:54.447 --> 55:02.791
[SPEAKER_14]: But we don't know if it's going to... It's kind of one of those things where we aren't trusting the rumor until we see it for ourselves there in the arcade, which is what most people should do instead of spreading rumors.

55:04.172 --> 55:09.794
[SPEAKER_14]: We're kind of waiting to see if they get that machine, because if they do get that machine, we want to have it there and do two kinds of tournaments.

55:09.874 --> 55:15.057
[SPEAKER_14]: Do DDR and for the other machine, because there's a lot of demand for that kind of tournament.

55:15.877 --> 55:16.958
[SPEAKER_14]: I know what that new machine is.

55:16.978 --> 55:18.618
[SPEAKER_14]: A Bunga Bunga.

55:20.479 --> 55:20.719
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

55:21.140 --> 55:22.240
[SPEAKER_14]: A Bunga Bunga tournament.

55:22.320 --> 55:22.821
[SPEAKER_14]: Very free.

55:23.281 --> 55:25.002
[SPEAKER_14]: Mambo!

55:25.062 --> 55:25.602
[SPEAKER_14]: Tournament.

55:27.103 --> 55:28.323
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, no.

55:31.385 --> 55:31.545
[SPEAKER_21]: Not...

55:34.101 --> 55:42.244
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, what about our Bimani Lanzon that's over at RVGL that's supposed to be setting up a tournament?

55:42.665 --> 55:45.986
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, that guy knows how to set up a tournament, but... I smelled alcohol in his breath.

55:46.026 --> 55:46.546
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

55:46.586 --> 55:46.806
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't.

55:46.846 --> 55:47.106
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't.

55:48.787 --> 55:49.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, what?

55:49.307 --> 55:50.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he drink vanilla coke?

55:50.568 --> 55:53.409
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you please explain the vanilla coke and alcohol joke for our listeners?

55:54.446 --> 56:02.008
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Irene is sitting here as we're coming into the show with a glass of vanilla coke and ice, asking everyone, does this taste like alcohol?

56:02.408 --> 56:04.749
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to figure out if someone spiked her vanilla coke.

56:04.789 --> 56:05.689
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still not quite sure.

56:05.709 --> 56:12.692
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, seriously, I've never had vanilla coke with ice in it before, but it tastes so, like, strange, you know?

56:12.712 --> 56:18.173
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like someone put, like, alcohol or GHB or something in it.

56:19.474 --> 56:21.214
[SPEAKER_14]: I gave you the date rape drug, Irene.

56:21.234 --> 56:23.715
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to go to my room and get fresh.

56:24.502 --> 56:26.984
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, now that you mention it... Oh, that's how you got pregnant.

56:28.925 --> 56:36.489
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we weren't going to mention it now, but next segment... Next segment, Irene's going to be on our webcam.

56:37.090 --> 56:41.813
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, we have to earn the money to play this song somehow.

56:43.654 --> 56:44.554
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay, yes.

56:44.654 --> 56:45.755
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, that topic.

56:45.795 --> 56:46.636
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Irene.

56:46.936 --> 56:50.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it kind of boring to have PA and freestyle anymore?

56:51.479 --> 56:51.759
[SPEAKER_14]: Well...

56:53.359 --> 56:53.779
[SPEAKER_14]: Wild Gerbil PA What?

56:53.799 --> 56:55.561
[SPEAKER_14]: Wild Gerbil PA You're just going to let loose Wild Gerbils on the machine?

56:55.581 --> 56:57.763
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if somebody messes up, it's just going to be BOOM!

56:57.823 --> 56:58.223
[SPEAKER_14]: Bunga Bunga!

57:22.793 --> 57:27.258
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm thinking like, you know, routines are good.

57:27.398 --> 57:37.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, people can spend a lot of time and prepare their routines instead of someone going up, oh, you know, I think I'm the shit and I'm just going to pay my $5 in PA or something.

57:37.330 --> 57:40.294
[SPEAKER_08]: I think routines, we should focus strongly on routines.

57:41.074 --> 57:50.663
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, people actually thinking up something to do and, you know, making it look nice and stuff as opposed to someone just doing hand flaps and all that stupid shit.

57:51.083 --> 57:51.463
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

57:51.503 --> 57:53.585
[SPEAKER_14]: We saw some real shitty routines at SCAT.

57:53.605 --> 57:54.686
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's because, I can tell you why.

57:54.726 --> 58:05.755
[SPEAKER_14]: It was from the people who would get up there at the registration desk, because I was sitting there at the registration desk, and there would be those people that would come up and go, Well, I don't know if I should enter improv freestyle or routine freestyle.

58:06.076 --> 58:06.176
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

58:07.361 --> 58:09.663
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what song could I do a routine to?

58:10.604 --> 58:14.307
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like 11 o'clock that morning and they're just going to pull a routine out of their butt.

58:14.327 --> 58:15.948
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no step charts with them.

58:16.369 --> 58:17.870
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I don't know anything.

58:17.890 --> 58:19.751
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what you're talking about there, Rob.

58:19.832 --> 58:24.916
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not like I got up there thinking I had memorized the song and it fucked it all up.

58:25.296 --> 58:29.479
[SPEAKER_14]: It's wonderful, because if you saw Loki enter the tournament, I think he was one of two people to fail his song.

58:30.020 --> 58:36.724
[SPEAKER_14]: And he actually knew, I mean, I can vouch, he knows the song he was doing by heart, and he knows it on stealth and everything.

58:36.764 --> 58:38.105
[SPEAKER_14]: He just, oops, you know.

58:38.746 --> 58:45.111
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sad to see that you, by technicality, place underneath some of those other people, but, you know, it's just technicality.

58:45.131 --> 58:48.893
[SPEAKER_13]: I got zero.

58:48.913 --> 58:50.274
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, Melanie, don't you want to share?

58:50.735 --> 58:51.015
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

58:51.035 --> 58:51.115
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

58:52.890 --> 58:57.972
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking, like, maybe we can have a DDR couples routine.

58:58.413 --> 59:00.614
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we kind of, you've seen that done before.

59:00.654 --> 59:03.395
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you mean like couples who sleep together?

59:03.535 --> 59:04.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

59:04.635 --> 59:05.796
[SPEAKER_14]: Couples that fuck.

59:06.476 --> 59:08.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know, this is the thing.

59:08.697 --> 59:09.658
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you got them.

59:09.718 --> 59:11.579
[SPEAKER_14]: She's suggesting the rice princess.

59:11.739 --> 59:12.579
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the thing.

59:12.599 --> 59:14.240
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, I don't know about that.

59:15.606 --> 59:16.326
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of what?

59:16.366 --> 59:16.726
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

59:17.286 --> 59:18.727
[SPEAKER_14]: A group thing.

59:18.927 --> 59:19.227
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

59:19.967 --> 59:20.707
[SPEAKER_08]: What the what?

59:21.227 --> 59:22.748
[SPEAKER_08]: No, okay, this is what I was thinking.

59:23.488 --> 59:24.708
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sweetie, I get it.

59:24.888 --> 59:25.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

59:26.068 --> 59:27.329
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if our bed's big enough.

59:27.369 --> 59:29.409
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, punch you in your throat.

59:30.289 --> 59:31.570
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shit.

59:31.630 --> 59:37.491
[SPEAKER_08]: What I was going to say is that this is going to sound very discriminating, but there's a reason why I would say it.

59:38.172 --> 59:42.476
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think the couples tournament would only be male-female.

59:43.177 --> 59:46.340
[SPEAKER_08]: And only because you know that there's going to be two guys... Hater?

59:46.480 --> 59:46.881
[SPEAKER_08]: Hater?

59:47.061 --> 59:47.581
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

59:47.641 --> 59:48.142
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why.

59:48.222 --> 59:49.223
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my rationalization.

59:49.303 --> 59:50.004
[SPEAKER_14]: Discriminator?

59:50.044 --> 59:50.965
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a discriminator?

59:50.985 --> 01:00:00.534
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be two really good guys that are going to pretend to be gay or something and want to enter together and do some routine and blow away everyone else.

01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:08.975
[SPEAKER_05]: The only issue I see with that though is that, you know, male, female.

01:00:09.745 --> 01:00:14.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, there aren't that many female freestylers out there, so it kind of makes it kind of difficult.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:18.434
[SPEAKER_15]: But hey, I think I'd pay money to see Mel B act gay with some other guy.

01:00:20.856 --> 01:00:21.697
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not good.

01:00:22.498 --> 01:00:25.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, once again, Mel B is not gay.

01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:26.682
[SPEAKER_05]: I can prove it.

01:00:26.922 --> 01:00:27.483
[SPEAKER_05]: I have proof.

01:00:27.503 --> 01:00:30.126
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe you, but I'd pay money to watch him act that way.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:31.347
[SPEAKER_15]: Just watch him pop up.

01:00:32.047 --> 01:00:33.327
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're right.

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:34.008
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that.

01:00:34.028 --> 01:00:35.668
[SPEAKER_14]: What about females and females?

01:00:35.808 --> 01:00:40.069
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, two females wanting to get on there and do some secret rendezvous action.

01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.929
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:41.469
[SPEAKER_08]: Hater.

01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:42.329
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:43.950
[SPEAKER_08]: Homophobe.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:44.050
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:45.130
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.510
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you, Rob.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.890
[SPEAKER_15]: Sit down.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:48.651
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know me.

01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:49.371
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't.

01:00:49.811 --> 01:00:51.151
[SPEAKER_15]: Why did I get silent all of a sudden?

01:00:51.271 --> 01:00:52.071
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time I talk.

01:00:52.171 --> 01:00:52.371
[SPEAKER_15]: God.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:54.352
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you, log.

01:00:54.372 --> 01:00:58.833
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're both.

01:00:59.353 --> 01:00:59.473
No.

01:01:00.689 --> 01:01:03.552
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, no, we haven't dropped Dark Tetsuya.

01:01:03.912 --> 01:01:05.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, we're at a ratings peak right now.

01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:06.254
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why.

01:01:07.015 --> 01:01:12.960
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't brought up shirtless Emi or anything, but somehow... No, that's three-titted Emi, okay?

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:13.941
[SPEAKER_16]: Get it right.

01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:15.202
[SPEAKER_16]: Pantless rage.

01:01:15.222 --> 01:01:20.326
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of which, Konami hasn't released any more of the DDRPC characters.

01:01:20.646 --> 01:01:21.367
[SPEAKER_16]: Very disappointing.

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:22.268
[SPEAKER_14]: Valencia and Guy.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:23.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week.

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:26.075
[SPEAKER_14]: Pack number two did come out last week.

01:01:26.095 --> 01:01:28.056
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we covered that last week.

01:01:28.076 --> 01:01:28.356
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we?

01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:29.597
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about number three.

01:01:29.617 --> 01:01:32.900
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we thought they'd be doing them every Friday, and they missed a Friday.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.201
[SPEAKER_14]: Shame, shame.

01:01:34.582 --> 01:01:35.742
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably be out on Monday instead.

01:01:36.903 --> 01:01:41.347
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to get, you know, Paul Terry to do the motion capture.

01:01:41.387 --> 01:01:44.089
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, what do you want to bet Paul Terry is one of the unlockable characters?

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.870
Nice.

01:01:46.591 --> 01:01:46.872
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

01:01:47.072 --> 01:01:48.733
[SPEAKER_15]: Shirtless, three-titted Paul Terry.

01:01:48.753 --> 01:01:49.514
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:50.695
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

01:01:53.616 --> 01:01:56.898
[SPEAKER_10]: I think now's a good time to go to break.

01:01:56.918 --> 01:01:59.559
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys think?

01:01:59.599 --> 01:01:59.859
[SPEAKER_10]: Terrible.

01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:23.309
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys want to hear in this break?

01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:24.150
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a request, somebody.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.530
[SPEAKER_16]: Metal Gear Solid.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:28.811
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, I promised Matt we'd hear the Metal Gear song from Beatmania.

01:02:29.991 --> 01:02:30.571
[SPEAKER_16]: The second one.

01:02:30.651 --> 01:02:33.472
[SPEAKER_14]: Metal Gear from Beatmania 3rd, Momo Moga.

01:02:33.612 --> 01:02:36.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we'll get to some of these songs in the break.

01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:37.933
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, take a break here.

01:02:37.953 --> 01:02:40.854
[SPEAKER_14]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:45.255

01:09:13.693 --> 01:09:14.853
[SPEAKER_14]: You wanted to add something to that, Irene?

01:09:15.214 --> 01:09:20.776
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I was going to say that this last break was brought to you by the letter M. Yep.

01:09:21.036 --> 01:09:21.557
[SPEAKER_14]: And why is that?

01:09:22.017 --> 01:09:24.438

01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:04.222
[SPEAKER_14]: She's our special guest here tonight.

01:10:04.902 --> 01:10:05.783
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk to Melody.

01:10:05.803 --> 01:10:07.883
[SPEAKER_14]: You're special tonight.

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:10.124
[SPEAKER_14]: You put that mic good and clear.

01:10:10.324 --> 01:10:12.205
[SPEAKER_14]: Just pretend you know you're going to give it some head there.

01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:12.985
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

01:10:14.045 --> 01:10:14.326
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

01:10:14.566 --> 01:10:16.406
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to get nice and close to your mouth.

01:10:16.466 --> 01:10:17.947
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

01:10:19.367 --> 01:10:19.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

01:10:20.668 --> 01:10:21.668
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

01:10:23.549 --> 01:10:24.409
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to.

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:26.830
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:29.251
[SPEAKER_14]: So you happen to be a machine owner.

01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:30.961
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am.

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:40.824
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, because there's a lot of people's fantasies to own their own machine, you know, I don't know, as they're thinking about late at night, as they're falling asleep, gosh, I wish I had my own dude.

01:10:41.244 --> 01:10:42.524
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it everything is cracked up to be?

01:10:44.185 --> 01:10:46.466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Brad?

01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:49.666
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I was going to say, does this machine vibrate, or what?

01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:56.388
[SPEAKER_05]: If you jump on it really hard, yes, it does.

01:10:57.589 --> 01:10:58.349
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, anyone?

01:10:58.469 --> 01:10:58.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone?

01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:04.209
[SPEAKER_14]: What made you want to get a DDR machine?

01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:06.970
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked DDR and Mel needed to get rid of it.

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:12.672
[SPEAKER_05]: So I talked really nice with my mom and said, Mom, I need money.

01:11:13.012 --> 01:11:14.673
[SPEAKER_05]: She gave me money and I bought it.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.234
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it the lazy way.

01:11:17.554 --> 01:11:19.895
[SPEAKER_14]: How often do you use it?

01:11:19.915 --> 01:11:21.575
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of depends on what I'm doing.

01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:23.716
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm kind of busy during the week, I'm like, eh.

01:11:24.577 --> 01:11:24.977
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

01:11:26.299 --> 01:11:27.580
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you have a Solo 2000 machine, correct?

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.220
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Solo 2000.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:33.665
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to ask, since you got your Solo 2000 machine, have you played Solo 2000 in the arcade?

01:11:34.315 --> 01:11:34.855
[SPEAKER_05]: and many more.

01:11:56.947 --> 01:12:00.992
[SPEAKER_14]: You do play in the arcade still, Max 2, because it's not... Max 2, 5th mix, 4th mix.

01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:03.435
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're not the same as Solo 2000.

01:12:03.996 --> 01:12:05.398
[SPEAKER_05]: There's almost nothing, you know.

01:12:05.478 --> 01:12:09.883
[SPEAKER_05]: Solo has a lot of songs that don't appear on any other mix, like My Baby Mama.

01:12:10.023 --> 01:12:10.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:12.106
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.

01:12:12.246 --> 01:12:15.050
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, strut your funky stuff and...

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:18.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of stuff, and it's not like you can play six-panel.

01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:22.618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you can play six-panel much anywhere else, too, which I'm just teaching myself how to do.

01:12:22.778 --> 01:12:24.399
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I play it normally.

01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:26.080
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends on what I'm doing.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.542
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play it anywhere from every day in a week to not even once a week.

01:12:29.642 --> 01:12:30.843
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just in my backyard.

01:12:30.883 --> 01:12:33.344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of sitting there saying, I'm bored, I'm going to go play DDR.

01:12:33.484 --> 01:12:33.764
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on.

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.726
[SPEAKER_14]: You looking into getting any of the upgrades, possibly?

01:12:35.746 --> 01:12:36.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a Fork Mix Plus?

01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:37.568
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, maybe.

01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:38.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, maybe.

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:41.973
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can find a way to keep the Solo 2000 preserved, because I like it.

01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:46.137
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rare enough machine that you're not going to find it everywhere on every street corner.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:53.582
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's a way to preserve it and I get money, you know, providing I ever find a job, yeah, I probably will do something with it.

01:12:53.662 --> 01:13:03.405
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how I was telling you a little earlier off the air before the show, Melody, they have a bootleg, or I don't know if it's bootleg or what, I think it's bootleg, a fifth mix upgrade for a solo machine.

01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:06.546
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually being given a link to a website here.

01:13:06.566 --> 01:13:06.826
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, really?

01:13:06.886 --> 01:13:07.406
[SPEAKER_14]: www.DarkSakura.com

01:13:29.215 --> 01:13:30.516
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's definitely not official.

01:13:30.796 --> 01:13:33.258
[SPEAKER_14]: This site is not official looking at all that I'm looking at.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:36.400
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not going to endorse it over the air because they can pay me if they want that.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:42.163
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like the Solos had hell anyway considering it's been broken and it had to be sent to KOJ to be fixed.

01:13:42.263 --> 01:13:47.326
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so apparently it's about $1,000 if you want to upgrade that puppy.

01:13:47.346 --> 01:13:48.006
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of a lot.

01:13:48.026 --> 01:13:52.129
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just buy another Solo for on the cheap and do it that way.

01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:53.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Upgrade one that I don't care about.

01:13:55.805 --> 01:13:56.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the original thought.

01:13:57.908 --> 01:14:00.771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really easy to just hop out there and play whatever I want.

01:14:01.492 --> 01:14:04.195
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazingly, I haven't had anyone really over to play it yet.

01:14:04.235 --> 01:14:06.077
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep saying, yeah, you want to come over and play solo for free?

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:11.217
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm coming next weekend.

01:14:11.277 --> 01:14:12.718
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to come play solo for free.

01:14:13.238 --> 01:14:14.939
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe we can do something and tape something for the show.

01:14:14.979 --> 01:14:15.459
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

01:14:15.479 --> 01:14:16.639
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

01:14:16.759 --> 01:14:18.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's always like, you keep it outside.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, you can keep a DDR machine outside as long as it's undercover and you take good care of it.

01:14:23.342 --> 01:14:29.664
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the pad in the bar because I have the one that actually has the bar in the real pad, not that raised shit.

01:14:31.139 --> 01:14:34.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have an actual bar on the machine and it's an actual single pad.

01:14:35.381 --> 01:14:39.604
[SPEAKER_05]: But as long as you just keep that covered up and keep the rest of it just careful, hey, it's fine.

01:14:39.664 --> 01:14:41.124
[SPEAKER_05]: It's survived a winter already outside.

01:14:41.404 --> 01:14:44.886
[SPEAKER_14]: Plenty of people in the chat room are saying, I'll come play, I'll come play.

01:14:45.126 --> 01:14:48.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I need to give out my DDR frames?

01:14:49.228 --> 01:14:50.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, money talks, you know?

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:53.371
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you found ways to make money off the machine?

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.413
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm the only one who plays it.

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.536
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't take it out to make appearances to places?

01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.518
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually that might be in the works.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:05.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really that there are some ideas that are being kicked around with using it in conjunction with some other things.

01:15:05.704 --> 01:15:07.285
[SPEAKER_05]: That might eventually happen, might not.

01:15:08.206 --> 01:15:10.168
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that place that the other one got kicked out of?

01:15:10.389 --> 01:15:10.789
[SPEAKER_15]: San Diego!

01:15:10.829 --> 01:15:14.533
[SPEAKER_15]: We should place it there and make a little money off of that.

01:15:15.962 --> 01:15:18.564
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought the idea was... I think this was actually an idea that came up on the show.

01:15:18.584 --> 01:15:20.906
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this was something Jamie suggested a few episodes back.

01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:28.691
[SPEAKER_14]: That we get a truck, get your solo machine, if you're willing, board it up on the truck, drive down to San Diego, and play it in the parking lot all day long.

01:15:29.231 --> 01:15:32.734
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's one of the reasons why I'm glad my machine is not listed in machine locations.

01:15:32.814 --> 01:15:37.297
[SPEAKER_05]: When I saw that, I almost was ready to email that chick and be like, I dare you to take away my solo, bitch.

01:15:38.978 --> 01:15:41.480
[SPEAKER_14]: They're saying in the chat room we should go on a California tour.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.201
[SPEAKER_14]: Put the machine in the back of a truck and get it to go...

01:15:45.703 --> 01:15:50.688
[SPEAKER_14]: That might actually be... I think we need to look into something like this.

01:15:50.728 --> 01:15:56.814
[SPEAKER_14]: When all the Christmas parades come up, we should enter the Orange Lounge crew or something.

01:15:56.834 --> 01:16:00.297
[SPEAKER_14]: We could get a DDR float and get some of us playing on the solo machine.

01:16:00.317 --> 01:16:01.218
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

01:16:01.258 --> 01:16:03.960
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll have drinks with arrow-shaped ice like I found.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.563
[SPEAKER_05]: I found an ice cube tray that's arrows shaped.

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:11.245
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd have the Shriner guys driving around in little carts right in front of us.

01:16:11.805 --> 01:16:15.527
[SPEAKER_14]: Behind us we'd have the high school cheerleaders going woo woo.

01:16:15.907 --> 01:16:20.489
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have high school cheerleaders back there, half the guys are going to be looking at that and not the arrows on the screen.

01:16:20.549 --> 01:16:21.129
[SPEAKER_05]: You know this.

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:23.910
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a U-Haul, that's an idea.

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:26.671
[SPEAKER_14]: Get a U-Haul and have a mini tourney inside the truck.

01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:28.172
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you might cook yourselves.

01:16:28.252 --> 01:16:29.673
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of asking for trouble.

01:16:29.733 --> 01:16:30.133
[SPEAKER_14]: Or the machine.

01:16:32.199 --> 01:16:33.300
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you want to say something, Joe?

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.643
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, he was kind of doing this, I wasn't sure if he was doing, fight the power, fight the power!

01:16:39.404 --> 01:16:43.588
[SPEAKER_10]: Those cheerleaders, they need to be dressed up like the nurse from I'm Alive.

01:16:43.608 --> 01:16:49.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we get them giant syringes so they can ride up and down on them?

01:16:49.552 --> 01:16:49.592
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh!

01:16:50.253 --> 01:16:53.355
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, I suggest, you know what, Melody, you and Irene...

01:16:54.887 --> 01:16:56.088
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get you some syringes.

01:16:56.368 --> 01:16:59.509
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give him a nice syringe right up and down.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.130
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I'll tell you what.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.751
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, I'm sure, would love to do her Emmy cosplay.

01:17:03.771 --> 01:17:05.332
[SPEAKER_14]: She's got a great Emmy costume she could do.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:08.494
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we dorks or what?

01:17:09.034 --> 01:17:11.255
[SPEAKER_14]: Better yet, next year we could do the Pride Parade.

01:17:11.275 --> 01:17:13.236
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everybody knows that DDR is really gay.

01:17:16.154 --> 01:17:17.254
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:17:17.714 --> 01:17:25.139
[SPEAKER_15]: Backpedaling here a little bit, but the thing about the U-Haul and playing a tournament in the U-Haul, that brings up an idea for a new type of tourney, PA thing.

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:37.487
[SPEAKER_15]: PA-ing while you're accelerating and decelerating and stuff from 50 to 60 miles an hour, then stop on the brakes and try to not... Backing up into your roommate's garage.

01:17:37.767 --> 01:17:39.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, inside joke.

01:17:40.936 --> 01:17:43.257
[SPEAKER_05]: PA on Bay Area Highways.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.618
[SPEAKER_05]: That would add an entire new element of difficulty to it.

01:17:46.698 --> 01:17:49.238
[SPEAKER_14]: If you win, or if you win, you get to stay on the truck.

01:17:49.278 --> 01:17:50.879
[SPEAKER_14]: If you lose, out the window you go.

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:53.659
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, if you win, you survive.

01:17:53.679 --> 01:17:54.980
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll, Grandma, roll!

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.320
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure you roll when you hit the ground, right?

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:57.581
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

01:17:59.561 --> 01:18:04.682
[SPEAKER_14]: I could insert a lame stop, drop, and roll joke here from last tournament, but then you were there, so I wouldn't get a laugh from this room.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:06.463
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the tournament, oh, you were there, right?

01:18:06.483 --> 01:18:06.643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:18:08.337 --> 01:18:08.978
[SPEAKER_14]: I was black.

01:18:09.219 --> 01:18:10.120
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you go.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.264
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay then, remember, stop, drop, roll.

01:18:13.524 --> 01:18:20.172
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a classic Orange Lounge moment brought to you by... Yes, Melody.

01:18:20.192 --> 01:18:20.673
[SPEAKER_11]: Melody as well.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:27.633
[SPEAKER_05]: But eventually, as far as I know, a Solo 2000 tournament might be a possibility.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:32.216
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I know a Solo 2000 that could be used for it, if people bribe me.

01:18:33.057 --> 01:18:34.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone drop me a PM.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:36.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I spell the name?

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.263
[SPEAKER_14]: They say that with throwing people off the truck thing, rate the bar for dear life.

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:57.488
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm already getting sponsorship offers here from various websites wanting to promote the DDR in a U-Haul tourney.

01:18:59.009 --> 01:19:00.369
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, hey, how about this?

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:12.791
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, speaking of raping the bar and stuff, we could put, okay, for our next PA tournament, we could put a nice little hot wire attached to the bar so when someone goes to grab the bar, they're met with a nice little jolt.

01:19:13.357 --> 01:19:13.657
[SPEAKER_14]: Zap.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:14.517
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

01:19:14.557 --> 01:19:15.698
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a bad idea.

01:19:16.598 --> 01:19:21.219
[SPEAKER_14]: We should do that for the next Sacramento tournament.

01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:24.520
[SPEAKER_14]: For Perfect Attack, we can hook up a little... You can do that with a battery thing.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.381
[SPEAKER_14]: Hook it up to the bar.

01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:27.041
[SPEAKER_14]: If you touch the bar, you get a little zap.

01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:27.441
[SPEAKER_14]: Bolt 2, motherfucker.

01:19:34.397 --> 01:19:35.138
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a dork.

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:37.380
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, surprise, surprise.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.001
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, look at my shirt.

01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:38.921
[SPEAKER_15]: I got this new shirt.

01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:39.722
[SPEAKER_14]: I see your shirt.

01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:43.666
[SPEAKER_15]: For the people in the radio land who can't see it, it's an 8-bit theater shirt.

01:19:43.906 --> 01:19:44.126
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

01:19:44.987 --> 01:19:47.430
[SPEAKER_15]: My wonderful Irene, Rice Princess, got this for me.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:48.050
[SPEAKER_15]: This is wonderful.

01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:51.413
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody at the store stares at me and goes, what a dork.

01:19:52.134 --> 01:19:52.995
[SPEAKER_15]: But they did that anyway, so...

01:19:54.696 --> 01:19:58.119
[SPEAKER_14]: The chat room saying it would be like that pain station pong game.

01:19:58.159 --> 01:19:58.799
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you heard of this?

01:19:58.839 --> 01:20:03.402
[SPEAKER_14]: That pong game that you play, and if you fuck up and the ball gets out of the zone, you get zapped.

01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:04.523
[SPEAKER_14]: Your finger gets zapped.

01:20:04.543 --> 01:20:05.304
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a real thing?

01:20:05.484 --> 01:20:06.565
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the pain station.

01:20:06.605 --> 01:20:08.846
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, some Dutch guy, I think, came up with it.

01:20:08.886 --> 01:20:11.008
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can give me a link to that article, I'd love to look at that.

01:20:11.088 --> 01:20:13.829
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we came up with an idea, Timmy and me, or something like that.

01:20:13.849 --> 01:20:18.813
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Beatmania with a foot at the bottom, and when you messed up, the foot would kick you in the groin.

01:20:20.225 --> 01:20:21.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't we come up with that?

01:20:21.345 --> 01:20:23.446
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like our second episode or something.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:25.927
[SPEAKER_14]: We said the DDR would have the vibrating foot.

01:20:26.587 --> 01:20:29.328
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, this is something I thought of.

01:20:30.388 --> 01:20:33.769
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, any other thoughts on tournaments?

01:20:33.849 --> 01:20:35.370
[SPEAKER_14]: Machine ownage or I don't know.

01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.610
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Smelly.

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Machine ownage is cool.

01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:39.111
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

01:20:39.771 --> 01:20:41.072
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody should buy their own machine?

01:20:41.732 --> 01:20:42.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:20:43.373 --> 01:20:44.433
[SPEAKER_05]: To do it, press A.

01:20:46.978 --> 01:20:49.902
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I've been given a link to the pain station.

01:20:49.982 --> 01:20:53.606
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, it is pretty cool to be able to just say, I want to play DDR.

01:20:53.626 --> 01:20:54.707
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to deal with anyone.

01:20:54.727 --> 01:20:55.728
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to deal with lines.

01:20:55.908 --> 01:20:57.210
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go outside and play it.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.933
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if I could get it inside somehow, I would.

01:20:59.993 --> 01:21:03.497
[SPEAKER_05]: But my house, that just doesn't really happen because I own too much crap.

01:21:04.145 --> 01:21:07.447
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the Pain Station is basically a game of Pong.

01:21:07.527 --> 01:21:12.409
[SPEAKER_14]: The only difference is that if you lose, the Pain Execution Units will hurt you.

01:21:12.689 --> 01:21:14.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Pain Execution Units?

01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:28.197
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a heat lamp which burns your hand, an electrical circuit which shocks the hand, and a whip which rapidly whips the same part of your hand over and over very fast with a wire, says Volkar Marwau, co-creator of the Pain Station.

01:21:28.237 --> 01:21:29.177
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep wanting to say Pain Station.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.878
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did this become popular?

01:21:32.119 --> 01:21:36.501
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't help but wonder what the designers were going for when they came up with this torture game machine.

01:21:37.122 --> 01:21:39.723
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the PlayStation for Sadomasochists.

01:21:39.943 --> 01:21:45.227
[SPEAKER_14]: Morale says, I was always interested in combining computers and the real world, and I wanted to create a computer game.

01:21:45.607 --> 01:21:49.629
[SPEAKER_14]: We decided we would do a game with pain, and we picked Pong because it's easy to play.

01:21:50.049 --> 01:21:51.991
[SPEAKER_14]: The pain station brings in the body and...

01:21:52.851 --> 01:21:55.312
[SPEAKER_14]: makes you feel the media so it's a new experience.

01:21:55.873 --> 01:22:04.337
[SPEAKER_14]: They've tried it before with the biofeedback and rumble packs, so it's a logical progression to go from rumble pack to, you know, being whipped in your finger.

01:22:05.098 --> 01:22:08.580
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's more to video games than nice graphics.

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.480
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I make a comment?

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:10.080
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:11.461
[SPEAKER_15]: They already have this.

01:22:11.521 --> 01:22:12.542
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Chrono Cross.

01:22:16.946 --> 01:22:22.189
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know what happens when you go off screen as long as all the boxes are clear?

01:22:22.209 --> 01:22:38.760
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have to be clear because if you did last season, you'd have to, like, go off screen Oh, wait, Brad, this is for you There you go Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night Take my wife, please You're married?

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:39.960
[SPEAKER_15]: Not anymore

01:22:43.184 --> 01:22:47.248
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Brad, you got from SoCalKicks, you got a... Oh, no, you didn't just diss Chrono Cross.

01:22:47.308 --> 01:22:48.049
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, you didn't.

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.391
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, you didn't.

01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:51.632
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me explain.

01:22:51.672 --> 01:22:56.537
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't feel like I have to, but... Okay, Chrono Cross is a good game, but you can't compare it to Chrono Trigger.

01:22:56.617 --> 01:22:57.398
[SPEAKER_15]: Just don't even try.

01:22:57.418 --> 01:22:57.998
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:22:59.259
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good game.

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.563
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go, thank you.

01:23:02.863 --> 01:23:04.925
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played it enough to form an opinion.

01:23:07.171 --> 01:23:07.411
So, topic?

01:23:07.431 --> 01:23:07.852
Should we... Topic!

01:23:07.872 --> 01:23:07.992
Topic!

01:23:08.533 --> 01:23:09.053
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about...

01:23:27.113 --> 01:23:28.235
[SPEAKER_16]: I can go over what's going on.

01:23:28.376 --> 01:23:29.538
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I know what I want to talk about.

01:23:29.798 --> 01:23:31.061
[SPEAKER_16]: Or we can do what you want to talk about.

01:23:31.081 --> 01:23:31.862
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what do you want to talk about?

01:23:32.343 --> 01:23:32.684
[SPEAKER_11]: You go ahead.

01:23:32.744 --> 01:23:33.525
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about your subject.

01:23:33.565 --> 01:23:35.229
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take a break and we'll come back and do what I want to talk about.

01:23:35.349 --> 01:23:35.609
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:38.254
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, brief sim world update here.

01:23:38.575 --> 01:23:38.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty.

01:23:39.361 --> 01:23:41.883
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Tourney Mix, still going on.

01:23:42.543 --> 01:23:47.266
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason, the files are still down, so I'll have to wait for those to come back.

01:23:48.707 --> 01:23:58.412
[SPEAKER_16]: NMR of Team Guilo is actually going to be posting, supposedly pretty soon, all the Euromix 2 DWIs, so that'll be pretty cool.

01:23:58.452 --> 01:24:00.914
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get to play the Euromix 2 tracks over here.

01:24:01.914 --> 01:24:04.376
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's pretty much it.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.237
[SPEAKER_16]: No new simulators out there.

01:24:06.337 --> 01:24:07.618
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been a couple actual...

01:24:08.783 --> 01:24:15.066
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a new DWI FileMaker, but I haven't gotten to try that yet, and that's about it.

01:24:15.186 --> 01:24:15.807
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty boring.

01:24:17.147 --> 01:24:18.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and Rob, would you want to talk about that?

01:24:18.548 --> 01:24:18.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, great.

01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:20.449
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes, Dr. Tsu, you want to say something?

01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:35.116
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just wanted to mention that I was working on some new result screen skins for Bomania DX featuring the... Well, I took the skins from 2DXStyle and created skins with them.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:36.597
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

01:24:38.049 --> 01:24:38.329
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

01:26:25.976 --> 01:26:29.205
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to cut from break to get some reaction from the room to that.

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:30.127
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys think of that?

01:26:30.949 --> 01:26:31.651
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm moved.

01:26:32.774 --> 01:26:33.998
[SPEAKER_15]: And I need to go clean my pants now.

01:26:35.362 --> 01:26:38.285
[SPEAKER_14]: What were the various things you guys were yelling there as that was going?

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:40.287
[SPEAKER_14]: It has no rhythm.

01:26:40.347 --> 01:26:45.732
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, they were saying in the chat room, stop, kill it now, my ears, my freaking ears.

01:26:46.173 --> 01:26:49.696
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like being forced to watch Britney Spears without her being scantily clad.

01:26:52.319 --> 01:26:54.601
[SPEAKER_14]: Big thanks to Twin for that two minutes of hell.

01:26:55.282 --> 01:26:58.065
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to some music we hope you like here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:31.511 --> 01:28:32.074
This is my destiny.

01:29:01.247 --> 01:29:02.288
Thanks for watching!

01:29:42.546 --> 01:29:43.530
Thanks for watching!

01:30:33.014 --> 01:30:34.715
Thank you for watching!

01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:17.151
[SPEAKER_28]: Bitch, get a new song.

01:33:38.459 --> 01:33:40.920
[SPEAKER_29]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.481
[SPEAKER_14]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 10.

01:33:45.481 --> 01:33:48.182
[SPEAKER_14]: They said we would never make it... Your mic is on, right?

01:33:48.642 --> 01:33:49.242
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, okay, thank you.

01:33:49.702 --> 01:33:51.163
[SPEAKER_14]: You are listening to episode number 10.

01:33:51.963 --> 01:33:55.804
[SPEAKER_14]: They said we would never get past episode number 2, and here we are into double digits.

01:33:56.004 --> 01:33:56.604
[SPEAKER_14]: Episode number 10.

01:33:56.864 --> 01:34:04.466
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish Jamie was here to celebrate in this moment as well, but I know she's off having a great time, and so... We still have her Warp Core Breeze.

01:34:04.486 --> 01:34:06.027
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have our alcoholic vanilla Coke.

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:06.647
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

01:34:07.047 --> 01:34:07.127
Yay.

01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:12.192
[SPEAKER_14]: So next week is going to be, we're calling it episode 10 and a half.

01:34:12.293 --> 01:34:14.994
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really going to, because we're not here in the studio, so it's going to be episode 10 and a half.

01:34:15.335 --> 01:34:17.296
[SPEAKER_14]: But then in two weeks we'll come back to episode 11.

01:34:17.916 --> 01:34:19.838
[SPEAKER_14]: All new intro, all new everything.

01:34:19.858 --> 01:34:21.799
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost going to be like we're giving the whole show a face look.

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you going to have a new intro?

01:34:24.441 --> 01:34:26.922
[SPEAKER_14]: To keep things fresh, keep things lively, new.

01:34:27.423 --> 01:34:28.864
[SPEAKER_06]: You've only had 10 shows.

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:31.085
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just, I want a new intro.

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:32.586
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how many times I've had to hear that intro?

01:34:32.766 --> 01:34:33.847
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a completely selfish thing.

01:34:33.867 --> 01:34:35.108
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had to hear that intro too many times.

01:34:35.368 --> 01:34:36.589
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I can make it better.

01:34:37.233 --> 01:34:40.315
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a good way to fix it if it ain't broke.

01:34:40.515 --> 01:34:43.297
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm a man and I like to do that.

01:34:43.597 --> 01:34:51.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Our new intro is going to feature Paul and Terry.

01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:54.305
[SPEAKER_14]: This was something I was thinking about a little bit earlier today.

01:34:55.085 --> 01:34:56.346
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I was thinking, imagine that.

01:34:57.747 --> 01:34:59.228
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR on the Game Boy.

01:34:59.288 --> 01:35:00.109
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you ever seen this?

01:35:00.389 --> 01:35:01.110
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck is the point?! !

01:35:04.423 --> 01:35:07.365
[SPEAKER_14]: Can somebody explain to me what the fuck is the point of DDR on the Game Boy?

01:35:08.906 --> 01:35:12.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Those who can't afford to get the cool stuff, they have to go with the crappy stuff.

01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:14.151
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, now, wait.

01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.313
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, we played DDR, like, button-button revolution.

01:35:17.353 --> 01:35:18.094
[SPEAKER_15]: There's not much difference.

01:35:18.634 --> 01:35:21.496
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, except for the, what is that, a 3-bit sound processor.

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:22.317
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that is a kind of...

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:43.748
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's for those people that, you know, they're out there that are just hardcore DDR players that need, it'd be like, you know, smoking and having the patch on at the same time, you just can't get enough of it, so you're willing to, you know, settle for, you know, the little Game Boy version, too, when you're driving, you know, maybe to the actual, you know, arcade or that kind of thing.

01:35:45.143 --> 01:35:46.164
[SPEAKER_15]: New tournament thing.

01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:51.531
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring in your Game Boy DDR thing and play the song on the Game Boy and the arcade at the same time.

01:35:51.611 --> 01:35:53.374
[SPEAKER_15]: And we tally your score together.

01:35:53.534 --> 01:35:54.034
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so cool!

01:35:54.054 --> 01:35:55.296
[SPEAKER_15]: The combination of the score.

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:56.838
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not.

01:35:56.858 --> 01:35:57.679
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right, it's not.

01:35:57.859 --> 01:35:58.440
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.942
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to make it sound exciting.

01:36:00.042 --> 01:36:00.683
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:36:00.923 --> 01:36:01.263
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.

01:36:02.819 --> 01:36:05.301
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we could play some game here in the studio.

01:36:06.362 --> 01:36:10.726
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't know if you guys have ever heard the Game Boy renditions of your favorite DDR tunes.

01:36:11.147 --> 01:36:16.272
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought maybe we could play some of those tunes and see how long it's going to take you guys to guess what the songs actually are.

01:36:16.532 --> 01:36:17.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Name that tune DDR style?

01:36:17.653 --> 01:36:18.594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's Name That Tune.

01:36:18.895 --> 01:36:21.017
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Name That Tune DDR Game Boy style.

01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:22.118
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to hear some of these.

01:36:23.806 --> 01:36:29.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody can answer, so when you think you know, I'm going to set this mic down, and when you think you know, grab the mic and say the answer, okay?

01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:33.592
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to set it down, and don't grab it until you know the answer, okay?

01:36:33.973 --> 01:36:39.036
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, don't look on the computer screen at the name, because it does come up on the screen, but I'm going to trust you all.

01:36:39.076 --> 01:36:41.698
[SPEAKER_14]: We're using the On Your Honor system, okay kids?

01:36:42.098 --> 01:36:45.200
[SPEAKER_14]: You're On Your Honor, okay?

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.683
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a jar full of mints for the Retard Society, and it says On Your Honor, so that's what we're doing here.

01:36:51.004 --> 01:36:51.164
Okay?

01:36:56.485 --> 01:36:57.926
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, I'm gonna put it down.

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:07.688
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna start off with a really easy one, okay?

01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:17.670
[SPEAKER_15]: Something from Naoki!

01:37:20.003 --> 01:37:20.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Butterfly?

01:37:22.225 --> 01:37:23.025
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I rule.

01:37:23.045 --> 01:37:23.465
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

01:37:23.545 --> 01:37:23.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

01:37:24.586 --> 01:37:25.387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm that geeky.

01:37:25.487 --> 01:37:26.347
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:30.190
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to guess V, but, you know, that's just... Okay, let's do another one.

01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:33.792
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to kind of narrate this as you go along.

01:37:33.872 --> 01:37:34.412
All right.

01:37:34.473 --> 01:37:34.633
Yay.

01:37:34.693 --> 01:37:35.613
[SPEAKER_14]: Selecting new song.

01:37:35.633 --> 01:37:37.414
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be really easy.

01:37:37.615 --> 01:37:37.975
All right.

01:37:38.015 --> 01:37:39.796
[SPEAKER_14]: If they don't know this, they're dumb.

01:37:52.322 --> 01:37:52.682
[SPEAKER_16]: and go!

01:37:58.004 --> 01:37:58.905
[SPEAKER_16]: Pink Dinosaur!

01:37:59.905 --> 01:38:01.146
[SPEAKER_16]: And you are the winner!

01:38:04.967 --> 01:38:06.048
[SPEAKER_16]: Woohoo, this song rocks!

01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.649
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

01:38:09.849 --> 01:38:12.170
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got the funk in my trousers for sure!

01:38:17.112 --> 01:38:17.853
[SPEAKER_15]: Next song please!

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.722
[SPEAKER_28]: My Summer Love?

01:38:27.822 --> 01:38:31.964
It was like, I knew it but I was like, shit, what is it?

01:38:32.084 --> 01:38:38.626
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you all enjoyed the Mr. T rendition of My Summer Love.

01:38:54.088 --> 01:38:54.849
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the mic on the ground?

01:38:55.389 --> 01:39:00.332
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, here we go.

01:39:00.392 --> 01:39:01.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:39:01.533 --> 01:39:02.173
[SPEAKER_08]: Doobie dub.

01:39:02.674 --> 01:39:03.334
[SPEAKER_08]: Doobie dub.

01:39:05.435 --> 01:39:06.596
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean, goddammit.

01:39:08.237 --> 01:39:10.879
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, song's stupid.

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:12.740
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't think fast enough.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:13.861
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go, here we go.

01:39:20.649 --> 01:39:21.210
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamy Dream.

01:39:22.932 --> 01:39:23.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:39:23.812 --> 01:39:26.015
[SPEAKER_05]: See, the solo comes in good for something.

01:39:30.099 --> 01:39:31.821
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, you get nothing.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:39.209
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

01:39:48.915 --> 01:39:49.676
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Paranoia!

01:39:50.456 --> 01:39:51.036
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's Dropout!

01:39:51.056 --> 01:39:51.116
[SPEAKER_15]: AM3P!

01:40:14.893 --> 01:40:17.335
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm such... How long is it?

01:40:17.515 --> 01:40:19.716
[SPEAKER_14]: Just think J-Dog sliding around.

01:40:20.276 --> 01:40:20.977
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:40:21.457 --> 01:40:22.238
[SPEAKER_14]: To that song?

01:40:22.378 --> 01:40:22.818
[SPEAKER_14]: That beat?

01:40:23.358 --> 01:40:23.658
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

01:40:23.678 --> 01:40:24.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the next one.

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:27.601
[SPEAKER_08]: Paranoia?

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there you go.

01:40:28.821 --> 01:40:31.143
[SPEAKER_14]: Not as tricky as you guessed that last time.

01:40:31.183 --> 01:40:31.763
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, two more.

01:40:31.803 --> 01:40:32.904
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:33.744
[SPEAKER_14]: These are harder ones.

01:40:34.085 --> 01:40:42.110
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is... I think this is kind of hard.

01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:42.370
Yeah.

01:40:46.796 --> 01:40:47.536
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe in miracles.

01:40:47.636 --> 01:40:48.316
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, very close.

01:40:48.396 --> 01:40:48.797
Sky High?

01:40:48.817 --> 01:40:48.957
Yeah.

01:41:09.454 --> 01:41:16.564
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's sad is the AM3P remix is actually probably better than the 303 bass mix on the Konomics there.

01:41:16.705 --> 01:41:17.666
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty bad.

01:41:17.766 --> 01:41:18.387
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I got.

01:41:18.667 --> 01:41:23.194
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think was better, the AM3P remix on Konomics or the Game Boy version?

01:41:28.542 --> 01:41:29.002
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Man Soundtrack

01:41:50.347 --> 01:41:52.289
[SPEAKER_14]: because those are all ripped from the Game Boy games.

01:41:52.369 --> 01:41:54.751
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think it says there that they're ripped from the Game Boy games.

01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:56.172
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if he's aware that's where they came from.

01:41:56.212 --> 01:42:04.420
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, if you're looking to actually play the horrible Game Boy versions, you can find the ROMs on bemoningstyle.com.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.521
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, they have the links there.

01:42:06.141 --> 01:42:07.921
[SPEAKER_16]: Now piracy is bad, young man.

01:42:08.202 --> 01:42:10.462
[SPEAKER_15]: Only if you, uh, own the cartridge.

01:42:10.602 --> 01:42:14.083
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have to delete it 24 hours after you, if you don't have it.

01:42:14.643 --> 01:42:16.004
[SPEAKER_15]: That is such crap.

01:42:16.124 --> 01:42:17.424
[SPEAKER_15]: I really need to go down.

01:42:17.744 --> 01:42:23.565
[SPEAKER_15]: Guys, I need to go down and delete about 500-some ROMs that I've got on my computer right now, because it's been 24 hours.

01:42:24.706 --> 01:42:25.586
[SPEAKER_09]: Longer than that.

01:42:25.626 --> 01:42:28.427
[SPEAKER_09]: And then delete them in, you know, the next 24 hours.

01:42:28.447 --> 01:42:28.927
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a...

01:42:35.556 --> 01:42:36.657
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

01:42:37.438 --> 01:42:40.080
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo, the chatroom, this is the chatroom's response to you, Brad.

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:41.561
[SPEAKER_14]: Only 500 ROMs?

01:42:42.261 --> 01:42:43.002
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know.

01:42:43.482 --> 01:42:53.610
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, hey, I just wiped my hard drive, I need to go start... Hey, I also only have 56K, I'm sorry, we're not in the Bay Area where everybody's... Fiber optic, or whatever.

01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:55.652
[SPEAKER_14]: This is turning into a penis-sized competition.

01:42:55.672 --> 01:43:02.277
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, uh, a guy from Florida says, I got 600 Game Boy ROMs, I got 600 Super Nintendo ROMs, I got 1400 NES ROMs, I got 400 Genesis ROMs, so...

01:43:04.941 --> 01:43:07.843
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what you can do with those?

01:43:07.944 --> 01:43:08.564
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need to say.

01:43:11.026 --> 01:43:11.747
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play them!

01:43:11.987 --> 01:43:13.168
[SPEAKER_14]: Over and over, that's right.

01:43:13.288 --> 01:43:15.229
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been too busy downloading the ROMs.

01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:18.752
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I don't have time for girls, I don't have time for anything.

01:43:19.032 --> 01:43:19.873
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me my ROMs.

01:43:20.934 --> 01:43:22.755
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to go to get yelled at in a minute.

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:23.336
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

01:43:23.816 --> 01:43:26.158
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is SoCalKick saying I don't have a wife?

01:43:27.421 --> 01:43:29.922
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt, since you're kind of our unofficial official co-host tonight,

01:43:55.277 --> 01:43:57.878
[SPEAKER_14]: You've built your own metal pads for DDR, correct?

01:43:58.639 --> 01:44:02.861
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that doesn't really help my argument that I have a life outside of DDR.

01:44:02.921 --> 01:44:05.462
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, so I'm great that we can go from that topic to this topic.

01:44:05.842 --> 01:44:08.604
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us about what a pain in the ass it is to build your own pads.

01:44:08.644 --> 01:44:12.085
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's a very big pain in the ass, especially if you don't know how to solder like I do.

01:44:12.866 --> 01:44:16.908
[SPEAKER_16]: So, my pads actually are really, really, really ghetto.

01:44:18.028 --> 01:44:18.489
[SPEAKER_16]: They have...

01:44:19.369 --> 01:44:21.530
[SPEAKER_16]: All their connections are actually all electrical tape.

01:44:21.930 --> 01:44:22.690
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really crap.

01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:25.331
[SPEAKER_16]: But it works from now and then.

01:44:25.871 --> 01:44:29.992
[SPEAKER_16]: It only comes apart if I throw it in the back of my car and drive around with it.

01:44:30.412 --> 01:44:31.893
[SPEAKER_16]: But they're pretty cool.

01:44:32.273 --> 01:44:35.734
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically based off the DDR at home pads.

01:44:36.274 --> 01:44:40.275
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe there's a huge thread in DDR Freak with directions on those.

01:44:40.335 --> 01:44:44.016
[SPEAKER_14]: I was about to say, where did you get the schematics on how to build your metal pads?

01:44:44.157 --> 01:44:48.578
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, a long time ago when the melting pot was online...

01:44:49.338 --> 01:44:51.760
[SPEAKER_16]: We used to get them there, but actually there's a huge link.

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:57.166
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about a 98-page thread that's on DDR Freak under the DDR at Home.

01:44:57.226 --> 01:44:58.146
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pinned at the top.

01:44:58.487 --> 01:45:00.248
[SPEAKER_16]: You can find all the links there.

01:45:00.929 --> 01:45:12.080
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I did a little bit differently than what they had on there is instead of taking actual PlayStation controllers and wiring them to that, I ripped apart my two old homepads that I had, softpads,

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:23.693
[SPEAKER_16]: and wired them to that because they're a hell of a lot easier to wire to because it's just a big, huge, flat metal thing you have to solder to instead of drilling the hole in the controller and getting the solder on there perfectly.

01:45:24.394 --> 01:45:26.636
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried it the other way and it was really hard.

01:45:27.217 --> 01:45:33.324
[SPEAKER_16]: Then for the arrows, I just took the same pad and chopped up the arrows and put them under plexiglass and they look cool.

01:45:34.765 --> 01:45:37.686
[SPEAKER_14]: What are some other home pads you'd recommend commercially out there on the market?

01:45:37.966 --> 01:45:41.887
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's a lot of third-party pads out there.

01:45:41.907 --> 01:45:45.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than the official Konami pads, is there anything out there that you'd endorse?

01:45:45.869 --> 01:45:49.450
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I've played the... Because I was looking at Software Etc.

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:52.931
[SPEAKER_14]: today, and they have these Mad Catz pads, and they look so stupid.

01:45:53.852 --> 01:45:56.094
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how well they play, but they look awful.

01:45:56.134 --> 01:46:00.739
[SPEAKER_14]: They look like cheap 50s, come on everybody, let's square dance type pads.

01:46:00.759 --> 01:46:05.044
[SPEAKER_16]: When it comes down to soft pads, they're pretty much all the same as far as the insides go.

01:46:05.244 --> 01:46:13.593
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, really the only difference between the Konami official soft pads and the third party ones is they've got these really thin, almost like...

01:46:14.714 --> 01:46:15.955
[SPEAKER_16]: www.DarkSakura.com

01:46:31.282 --> 01:46:38.025
[SPEAKER_16]: The difference between the third-party ones is the third-party ones have almost like a barcode going across.

01:46:38.045 --> 01:46:45.869
[SPEAKER_16]: They've got just small, thin layers going across, whereas the Konami official ones have just the whole solid layer.

01:46:45.969 --> 01:46:49.031
[SPEAKER_16]: So you probably get better connections with the Konami official ones.

01:46:49.051 --> 01:46:49.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

01:46:50.212 --> 01:46:55.316
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, on the top of some of the Konami ones, they're textured differently, which doesn't really do anything.

01:46:55.336 --> 01:47:00.400
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you ever seen the Dreamcast ones that have that funny little layer over the top?

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.542
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like tracing paper or something over the top of the pad.

01:47:03.562 --> 01:47:04.383
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks very odd.

01:47:04.423 --> 01:47:05.184
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very cool, though.

01:47:05.204 --> 01:47:06.385
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you've ever seen them.

01:47:06.725 --> 01:47:07.446
[SPEAKER_14]: Never seen that.

01:47:08.506 --> 01:47:15.913
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, taking a step up from the soft pads, you've got the ignition pads, which I played these at Fanime this year.

01:47:17.228 --> 01:47:18.729
[SPEAKER_16]: and everyone says they're really cool.

01:47:19.029 --> 01:47:19.729
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate the things.

01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:21.070
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they fucking suck.

01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:23.972
[SPEAKER_14]: Now wait, I think we gotta, you're talking about the ignition pads?

01:47:24.072 --> 01:47:24.272
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:47:24.312 --> 01:47:31.476
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we gotta counter-argument here because Glenn here, Lolo, who I haven't introduced yet, he's in the studio, he actually has an ignition pad and what do you think?

01:47:32.356 --> 01:47:37.819
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one of the new ones, the Ignition 2.0s, and that's how I passed my first CATA.

01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.881
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can pass Dynamite Rave at home on that.

01:47:42.065 --> 01:47:46.047
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, you know, in my defense, I played Ignition 1, Pat.

01:47:46.107 --> 01:47:48.668
[SPEAKER_16]: So, obviously they've probably gotten better.

01:47:48.768 --> 01:47:56.332
[SPEAKER_16]: The problem I had with the last one is, even though they did have raise buttons, which was nice, the problem was is they're raised so much, when you're playing on them, it just feels weird.

01:47:56.612 --> 01:48:01.935
[SPEAKER_16]: And it actually, you know, really hurt my ankles after just playing about one song.

01:48:02.735 --> 01:48:08.078
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were pretty responsive, but it was just, it hurt the hell out of my ankles, so I couldn't play anymore.

01:48:08.198 --> 01:48:10.659
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still not as good as the arcade, but...

01:48:11.835 --> 01:48:12.816
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pass a cat at home.

01:48:13.056 --> 01:48:14.036
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's all I have to say.

01:48:14.517 --> 01:48:15.597
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pass a cat at home.

01:48:15.857 --> 01:48:17.258
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pass a cat at home.

01:48:17.799 --> 01:48:22.661
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't do that on a Konami official pad without being halfway across the room when you're done.

01:48:22.882 --> 01:48:23.142
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:48:24.523 --> 01:48:25.183
[SPEAKER_16]: Then, let's see.

01:48:25.463 --> 01:48:28.745
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, a step up from those pads, you've also got the metal pads that are out there now.

01:48:28.765 --> 01:48:36.790
[SPEAKER_16]: They have the Kevin K pads, which Kevin K has been really getting reamed over because they suck.

01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:38.551
[SPEAKER_16]: He has horrible wiring on them.

01:48:39.311 --> 01:48:41.633
[SPEAKER_16]: Then there's also the new six panel metal pads out there.

01:48:41.673 --> 01:48:45.796
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll run about, I believe, 200 bucks a piece that you can actually find online.

01:48:45.836 --> 01:48:48.778
[SPEAKER_16]: There's tons of links in the DDR Freak at Home forum.

01:48:49.939 --> 01:48:50.640
[SPEAKER_16]: They look alright.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.041
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't gotten to play on any of them.

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:53.500
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:47.579
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope, not at all, because after the cost of building them, which is roughly about $150 per pad, let's just say you're building the same one I had, and then you have to charge a little bit more to get some profit, actually, off of it, plus shipping, you're only going to be making about $10 a pad, and it's a good 40 hours worth of work to make each... It took me 40 hours to build two pads, and I built them at the same time, and...

01:49:48.519 --> 01:49:48.820
[SPEAKER_16]: and so on.

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:02.422
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not worth it.

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:05.484
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a guy that tried doing it a while back, Beat Gear.

01:50:05.924 --> 01:50:07.325
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes, Beat Gear.

01:50:07.945 --> 01:50:13.149
[SPEAKER_16]: Which were like $400 for these pads and stuff, and I don't even know if anyone's actually gotten those yet.

01:50:13.169 --> 01:50:18.512
[SPEAKER_16]: I think maybe a few people have gotten them, but that was almost a year ago, I think.

01:50:18.993 --> 01:50:24.397
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just taken forever, so I wouldn't recommend actually starting a business that way.

01:50:24.597 --> 01:50:26.438
[SPEAKER_14]: Just make your own and be done with it.

01:50:26.758 --> 01:50:28.179
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

01:50:47.645 --> 01:50:50.908
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

01:50:51.049 --> 01:50:56.514
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and as would be fitting, I'm going to play a request.

01:50:56.534 --> 01:50:59.777
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody wanted to hear some more Orange Lounge, the artist, so here you go.

01:50:59.797 --> 01:51:10.869
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio

01:52:35.056 --> 01:52:35.959
Thanks for watching!

01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:21.091
[SPEAKER_21]: Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

01:53:49.049 --> 01:53:53.853
I'll show you a miracle Do you believe in love?

01:53:53.913 --> 01:53:58.816
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm just singing now I'm a channel Oh yeah

01:54:15.354 --> 01:54:17.291
[SPEAKER_17]: and many more.

01:56:12.154 --> 01:56:17.158
[SPEAKER_26]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

01:56:17.959 --> 01:56:21.762
[SPEAKER_26]: Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron, and Jessica.

01:56:22.242 --> 01:56:24.184
[SPEAKER_26]: Saturdays, 6.30 p.m.

01:56:24.244 --> 01:56:25.205
[SPEAKER_26]: to 9.30 p.m.

01:56:25.245 --> 01:56:29.228
[SPEAKER_26]: Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.

01:56:34.152 --> 01:56:35.293
[SPEAKER_17]: I got you, babe.

01:56:37.575 --> 01:56:38.596
[SPEAKER_17]: I got you, babe.

01:56:46.816 --> 01:56:49.078
[SPEAKER_21]: Step Squad to Orange Lounge!

01:56:49.438 --> 01:56:51.259
[SPEAKER_21]: This PDR sucks!

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.062
[SPEAKER_21]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

01:57:11.414 --> 01:57:12.935
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was one quick thing I did want to say.

01:57:13.015 --> 01:57:13.275
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

01:57:13.535 --> 01:57:16.377
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Jamie's out of the state tonight.

01:57:16.417 --> 01:57:17.818
[SPEAKER_14]: She's off in Nevada and Vegas.

01:57:17.858 --> 01:57:22.560
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought, does anybody have any interesting playing DDR out of the state stories they want to share?

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.501
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, not playing California?

01:57:23.621 --> 01:57:33.707
[SPEAKER_14]: Because California, if you ever looked at where all the machines are located throughout the nation, California is by far the biggest, you know, most well-populated with DDR.

01:57:34.107 --> 01:57:36.108
[SPEAKER_14]: Any funny stories about playing DDR out of state?

01:57:37.008 --> 01:57:37.529
[SPEAKER_14]: Have anything?

01:57:37.889 --> 01:57:39.330
[SPEAKER_14]: Melody or Matt?

01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:39.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:57:40.282 --> 01:57:49.950
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not particularly funny, but back when I was playing at O-Trick level, I happened to go to Reno and was playing on a USA for the simple fact that's all they had.

01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:54.795
[SPEAKER_05]: The Nugget, I think it was, and I scared the hell out of the locals.

01:57:55.255 --> 01:58:07.425
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they thought they could only do basic, and here I come in and I have, like, La Senorita Trick, and I nearly full combo the thing, and they're just like, oh my god, look at her, and then I go to dub-by-dub advance, they're just like, oh my god, look what she's doing!

01:58:07.466 --> 01:58:07.846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like...

01:58:08.809 --> 01:58:10.511
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that great.

01:58:10.551 --> 01:58:11.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, people.

01:58:12.773 --> 01:58:14.254
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about the only experience I have.

01:58:14.294 --> 01:58:17.657
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting until I go back to the Midwest and really scare the crap out of them.

01:58:17.737 --> 01:58:18.158
[SPEAKER_14]: Right on.

01:58:18.418 --> 01:58:20.500
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hear there's some pretty good arcades in the Midwest, though.

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.701
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can find them.

01:58:21.801 --> 01:58:22.561
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you can find them.

01:58:23.963 --> 01:58:25.364
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have anything to share, Matt?

01:58:26.324 --> 01:58:29.648
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well, my first game of DDR was in Lake Tahoe.

01:58:29.929 --> 01:58:31.030
[SPEAKER_14]: Mine first game was in Vegas.

01:58:31.210 --> 01:58:34.254
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and that was pretty bad.

01:58:34.294 --> 01:58:40.001
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways, a while back I went down... Actually, it was during my birthday, I believe, last year.

01:58:40.201 --> 01:58:41.022
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to...

01:58:42.003 --> 01:58:45.325
[SPEAKER_16]: Lake Tahoe, and Reno to go gamble because I was 21.

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:51.768
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I went there and I got to play a third Korean that was in Circus Circus.

01:58:53.128 --> 01:58:55.869
[SPEAKER_16]: That really sucked because they had the stage pushed right up to the machine.

01:58:55.889 --> 01:58:59.751
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was like playing and hugging the screen at the same time.

01:58:59.791 --> 01:59:01.112
[SPEAKER_16]: I love DDR.

01:59:01.572 --> 01:59:02.993
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, it was pretty bad.

01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:07.415
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a bunch of drunk old people staring at me like, what the hell is he doing?

01:59:07.535 --> 01:59:08.995
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is he stepping on that machine?
