00:32.600 --> 00:34.480

00:34.480 --> 00:36.480
Now let me take this difficult two-one-two-fuck- Ew!

00:36.480 --> 00:38.440
You have no moral self

00:38.440 --> 00:42.840
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of her face

00:42.840 --> 00:44.840
Kiss my grip, mooch.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.840
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hiney ho.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.840
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
Me too!

00:50.840 --> 00:51.840
Uh, fucker, yeah?

00:51.840 --> 00:53.840
I'm working on it.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.840
Loser.

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
Lame.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.840
I'm a fan of my face.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
Breathing.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Breath.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
Heaving breath.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
Heaving.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
Whatever.

01:02.840 --> 01:08.840
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.840
I am your singing telegram

01:13.840 --> 01:20.840
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

01:20.840 --> 01:22.840
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.840
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.840
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:30.840 --> 01:35.840
Typically I would be saying joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSapra.

01:35.840 --> 02:05.520
I see ice cream.

02:05.520 --> 02:12.520
want ice cream? They're ice cream candies. It's ice cream time! Now you know what the

02:12.520 --> 02:20.320
ice cream time sounds like. Of course, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends.

02:20.320 --> 02:26.360
Say hello to Joe, also known as Dark Tetsuya. And we've got Irene, the rice princess. Is

02:26.360 --> 02:31.840
there alcohol in vanilla coke? There might be, in that one perhaps. And we've also got

03:31.760 --> 03:50.000
Can you hear the cheering?

03:50.000 --> 04:05.000
Super performance!

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
Nice!

04:14.000 --> 04:42.560
Perfect!

04:42.560 --> 04:49.560
Our dance showed us a dream for the future. Tomorrow is another day. You're the one who'll give us hope for the future.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.560
Today or not today It doesn't mean that much to me

05:07.560 --> 05:09.560
Kiss me and set me free

05:09.560 --> 05:12.560
You can do that, you can do that

05:12.560 --> 05:15.560
So what's it gonna be?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.560
A real love for poetry

05:17.560 --> 05:19.560
Kiss me and set me free

05:19.560 --> 05:22.560
You can do that, you can do that

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
I treat you like a dog, I treat you like a frog

05:25.560 --> 05:27.560
If you ever let me down, you will love me, baby

05:27.560 --> 05:30.560
I am sure of what I want

05:30.560 --> 05:32.560
Tell me what to do

05:32.560 --> 05:34.560
Should I love you like a fool?

05:34.560 --> 05:42.560
Should I stop playing fool? What is good enough for you to make it happen?

05:42.560 --> 05:47.560
Let me say you'll let me go But either way I've got to know

05:47.560 --> 05:53.560
What is good enough for you to make it happen?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.560
What about you?

05:56.560 --> 06:08.560
Come on inside, it's driving me crazy Am I alone to feel this way?

06:08.560 --> 06:19.560
Come on inside, tell me you're the way back Show me that I'm the one to love you like a fool

06:19.560 --> 06:25.680
I been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go

06:25.680 --> 06:39.180
Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe I been married a long time ago

06:42.180 --> 06:49.460
I been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go

06:49.460 --> 06:54.460
I've been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go?

06:54.460 --> 06:56.460
Where did you come from, Cotton Eye Joe?

07:03.460 --> 07:06.460
He came to town like a magic storm

07:06.460 --> 07:10.460
He rode through the fields to ask for help

07:10.460 --> 07:13.460
He was born to a solid father of a gun

07:13.460 --> 07:17.460
But all his trouble was running so fast

07:17.460 --> 07:32.660
I've been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go?

07:32.660 --> 08:00.180
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

08:00.180 --> 08:04.880
this on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

08:04.880 --> 08:09.280
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.080
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the

08:14.080 --> 08:19.480
best things in life are free. Well, thank you, Mel, for letting us know that one. You're

08:19.480 --> 08:24.340
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and that set we had all Euromix 2 stuff. Starting it

08:24.340 --> 08:29.420
off Vanity Angel with Fix and in the middle there Love Ya Like a Fool by Jessica Folker.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.100
Kind of sounds a little bit like Divas, a little bit of that R&B stuff.

08:33.100 --> 08:38.740
What the folk-er was that, huh Brent?

08:38.740 --> 08:41.880
And of course, if you didn't know that one, probably one of the most well-known songs

08:41.880 --> 08:42.880
on there.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.540
At least I know that one very well, Rednecks with Cotton Eye Joe.

08:46.540 --> 08:51.200
They're either Rednecks, but they spell it the leet way, they spell it a Rednecks with

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
an X.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.200
Like, oh yeah, they're out to get you.

08:56.200 --> 09:02.620
So I have to ask Melody, if Melody can get on the mic here, because Melody gets asked

09:02.620 --> 09:03.620
this question all the time.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.620
We just played the promo.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.620
Where is Mel B?

09:05.620 --> 09:09.260
Mel's not here.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.380
I swear I'm getting a shirt that says that.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.380
Mel's not here.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.600
No, but Mel's in the same place where Jamie's at.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
They're all in Vegas together.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
Yes, he's not getting back in Vegas, I'm sure.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.860
I don't think it's any secret.

09:17.860 --> 09:23.100
There's a little moderator's convention going on in Vegas for DDR Freaks, so that's where

09:23.100 --> 09:24.100
they're all at right now.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.100
And every mod has to be.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
night away.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.180
Every mod asks me, are you going along too?

09:28.180 --> 09:29.180
Are you going along too?

09:29.180 --> 09:30.180
No, I'm not a mod.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.180
I can't go.

09:31.180 --> 09:32.180
I'm poor.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.700
Unless anyone wanted to, like, sponsor me for a trip to Vegas, it just wasn't happening.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.480
I'm sure Jamie's having tons of fun down there.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.500
She was going to be recording some interviews for us, hopefully, because there's a lot of

09:41.500 --> 09:44.380
well-known people in the community that are going to be there.

09:44.380 --> 09:48.260
Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get the tape player to take down there and tape some

09:48.260 --> 09:49.260
stuff.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.260
So, we're shit out of luck.

09:50.260 --> 09:53.380
But hey, that just means we're just going to have to go around throughout the community

09:53.380 --> 09:58.300
and get the interviews, you know, at other times. And hopefully we get a drunken voicemail

09:58.300 --> 10:03.920
because for the Saturday night program that I do, understudationlive.org, they're supposed

10:03.920 --> 10:08.120
to be leaving a drunken voicemail for that show, so I'm pretty sure I'd be able to use

10:08.120 --> 10:13.700
that drunken voicemail on this show if we can get it, so we'll see, we'll see, who knows.

10:13.700 --> 10:19.020
Alright, I was just given a link to read some results for a tournament that happened yesterday

10:19.020 --> 10:22.140
at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.140
I haven't been there yet.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.200
I hear it's really cool though.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.300
It's like a golf land in San Francisco is what they're calling it, because they've got

10:28.300 --> 10:32.400
I believe Dance Maniacs as well, kind of a question mark, but I know they also have a

10:32.400 --> 10:37.020
BeatMania 3 7th, which is not a very commonly seen machine.

10:37.020 --> 10:43.540
So the results of that contest were first place was Uncle Fuzz of Dot Half, and second

10:43.540 --> 10:47.240
place was the Asian Harry Potter of Dot Half.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.540
The Asian Harry Potter.

10:48.540 --> 10:53.460
I know a guy that looks like an Asian Harry Potter. It's not this guy, but that's funny.

10:53.460 --> 10:58.760
And then third place was Black Lab of Team P.O.P. I keep wanting to say Poop when I see

10:58.760 --> 11:04.720
that except there's only one O, so it's Team Pop. And fourth place was C. Hop of Team,

11:04.720 --> 11:09.020
and it's got all this leet speak. It's G.E., basically. So congratulations to all those

11:09.020 --> 11:12.880
people. I noticed the real names of the third and fourth place winners, both Ryan. So if

11:12.880 --> 11:15.500
your name's Ryan, you must be pretty good at Perfect Attack. This is only a Perfect

11:15.500 --> 11:21.600
attack tournament. No freestyle. It was just a mini-tournament. So, congratulations to

11:21.600 --> 11:25.060
all those of you that placed or participated in that tournament. Sounds like a fun time.

11:25.060 --> 11:30.140
I should have gone out there. I think I vaguely heard about it, but I didn't know it was this

11:30.140 --> 11:34.460
soon. Thought it was a ways away. Whoops, my bad. Anyway, oh, I'm being yelled at in

11:34.460 --> 11:41.700
the chat room, Team Pop. I have to say hi to Tal, because he'll beat me up if I don't.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.200
So there you go. Why aren't you here? That's my question.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.200
Ah, you didn't get to whore the mic.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
Yeah, you didn't get to whore the mic tonight, nah nah nah.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.200
And, uh, thanks to Black Lab for giving me that link,

11:51.200 --> 11:54.200
and he wants everybody to know that he beat Tigger. So, there you go.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.200
Did you say Tigger?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.200
No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.200
Tigger is somebody's online name.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.200
It's not like a euphemism for your private parts like it is for you, Brett.

12:04.200 --> 12:08.200
What? No, I don't hear what I'm talking about.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
Bounce, bounce, what?

12:10.200 --> 12:32.000
I have to make a correction to last week.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.400
We debuted on the show some new 8th style MP3s.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.680
You might have heard this one, we played M for you.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.280
Crap!

12:42.280 --> 12:45.540
Well, you know what?

12:45.540 --> 12:46.540
They're fake anyway.

12:46.540 --> 12:49.000
That's what we just found out during the week.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.920
It's not confirmed that they're fake, but let's just say it's not confirmed that they're

12:51.920 --> 12:53.100
real either.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.040
We actually took a really good listen to them outside.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.360
Now obviously to suit all you modem users who are listening to this show, we have to

12:59.360 --> 13:03.140
down code the show a lot, so you can't really hear the instruments as clear as we can.

13:03.140 --> 13:08.440
We really listened to that, and it doesn't quite sound like it came off a B-Mania machine.

13:08.440 --> 13:14.040
Possibility it still could be a song, but the Magic 8-Ball says, all signs point to

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
no.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.040
So...

13:16.040 --> 13:20.140
Well, doesn't DJ Taka have his own website, or was that a talk, or I get confused.

13:20.140 --> 13:21.140
Taka has his own website.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.140
Whatever.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.140
I don't believe Taka does.

13:23.140 --> 13:26.980
It sounds like a freakin' pushpin anyway, so...

13:26.980 --> 13:27.980
It doesn't matter.

13:27.980 --> 13:28.980
That song sucks ass.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.380
I hope it's not real.

13:30.380 --> 13:36.380
I hope no actual artist that would be featured on any Bimani would make that piece of shit.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.380
We'll see, who knows.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.380
But then again, there's Crash, so...

13:40.380 --> 13:42.380
Yeah, as long as Crash exists, who knows.

13:42.380 --> 13:45.380
Breakdown!

13:45.380 --> 13:48.380
What else do we want to say? Oh, next week's show.

13:48.380 --> 13:52.380
And I haven't told anybody in here the plan for next week's show, but I did talk about it with Jamie.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.380
Next week's show, I'm not going to be here.

13:56.380 --> 14:04.520
Because next weekend is Labor Day Weekend, so we get three days off work. So I'm going out of town for the whole weekend.

14:04.520 --> 14:16.360
So we're not going to be doing a live show next week, but what we're going to do on Wednesday night over at Roseville Golfland, we're going to tape the show live at Golfland on Wednesday night and we're going to air it on Sunday night.

14:16.360 --> 14:26.200
So I hope all you guys can make it out to Golfland on Wednesday night. We're going to tape the show out there. Patron harassing will be encouraged because we don't get to do this very often.

14:26.200 --> 14:32.440
So, somebody already suggested we play the counterweight trick on Beachhead with some

14:32.440 --> 14:38.640
unsuspecting people, and we're going to go out there and we're going to just have fun

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
with it.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.640
We're going to run around.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
Who knows?

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
It's going to be a crazy show.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
It's going to be a very experimental show.

14:43.640 --> 14:47.520
We don't know what we're going to do really at this point, but we are going to be taping

14:47.520 --> 14:50.660
next week's show live at Golf Land this Wednesday night.

14:50.660 --> 14:56.700
I don't know an exact start time, so after seven at some point, but not too late, because

14:56.700 --> 14:59.500
you know, I have to work on Thursday, so I can't say all too late, but...

14:59.500 --> 15:03.780
I guess we could say forget about having any tournaments there any time in the near future.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.700
Well, who knows, we'll see what we can do.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.860
Management might not like us after Wednesday.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.820
We'll see.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.380
And I don't care...

15:12.380 --> 15:16.420
Any other plans for what you guys want to do on Wednesday over at Golf Plan?

15:16.420 --> 15:18.740
I'll be bringing, yes, I'm very obsessed.

15:18.740 --> 15:24.300
I'll be bringing my mobile editing computer with me for edits.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.540
You're going to kill people with your edits.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.540
I finished...

15:26.540 --> 15:30.340
By the way, tell people, you know, this is a national show, we've got people all over

15:30.340 --> 15:33.460
the U.S. who are participating, so not everybody's going to be able to participate in this, but

15:33.460 --> 15:37.180
maybe for some of the Bay Area local people, tell everybody about your edit contest coming

15:37.180 --> 15:38.180
up.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.180
Okay, well I have an edit contest.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.580
Normally, I've been posting on the SAC reminding boards.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.420
Basically the edits fall in two categories, you have freestyle and then you have hell

15:46.420 --> 15:52.380
it. It's a really fucking hard edit. And because I work at a video distribution company, normally

15:52.380 --> 15:59.660
prizes are a whole bunch of DVDs. And I can say this much that I won the last edit contest.

15:59.660 --> 16:03.780
I won the freestyle portion. I literally must have gotten hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs.

16:03.780 --> 16:09.040
So much stuff. Insane. Cool. And like screeners of stuff that wasn't even released yet. I

16:09.040 --> 16:15.260
saw American Psycho 2 before any of you. No, I didn't watch it. It didn't look good. But

16:15.260 --> 16:18.260
Because I have it. And you don't.

16:18.260 --> 16:25.260
Tons of anime DVDs for sure. I know that first place is going to get Lord of the Rings and both awesome powers movies.

16:25.260 --> 16:30.260
That's for sure. And then I just have both of them.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.260
Just a bunch of crap. It's first and second.

16:32.260 --> 16:35.260
It takes what, a half hour to make a decent edit maybe?

16:35.260 --> 16:40.260
Nothing to enter. It's totally free to enter. You just have to be there.

16:40.260 --> 16:47.260
At some point, I was trying to do it where I could have people submit edits online to me, but that got to be too confusing.

16:47.260 --> 16:49.260
No, that's not fair. They gotta be there. They gotta be there in person.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.260
Yeah, so you have to be down at Sun Splash in order to enter.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.260
Yeah, that's about it.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.260
Cool. I want to give you a free plug for that.

16:55.260 --> 17:01.260
Well, this time around, hopefully since I've got that nice little laptop, hopefully everything works. I haven't gotten them set up yet.

17:01.260 --> 17:06.260
I'll be able to copy the edits from people's cards and actually be able to post them on the internet when I'm done.

17:06.260 --> 17:10.540
Well, I finished my hell edit today, so those that saw it, don't say anything about it,

17:10.540 --> 17:12.540
but it's going to be good, I think.

17:12.540 --> 17:16.500
I hate to stroke my own ego here, but I think you'll like it.

17:16.500 --> 17:24.780
Well, also speaking of edits, my edits are now on the SoCal Kicks website, www.socalkicks.com.

17:24.780 --> 17:27.980
And actually, maybe we can get the winners of the contest to get all those edits.

17:27.980 --> 17:33.220
Maybe if we kiss enough ass with SoCal Kicks, he'll put all those edits up for us.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.220
Who knows?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.220
I'm sure.

17:35.220 --> 17:39.220
I'll be sending them some more at some point, just have to get them making some.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.220
Sounds good.

17:40.220 --> 17:44.060
I was trying to think of more housekeeping things I wanted to talk about.

17:44.060 --> 17:49.160
Obviously the Bomani Music Amore program, always on this station when we're not live.

17:49.160 --> 17:53.060
All sorts of stuff from Dance Mania, all the DDR, 2DXs.

17:53.060 --> 17:56.200
We've been updating that with new MP3s here and there.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.820
We're going to be hopefully getting much, much more music soon because we're going to

18:00.820 --> 18:04.300
have to buy some more space, so that'll mean way more music.

18:04.300 --> 18:08.540
And basically our philosophy of the Milani Music Award program is don't play the stuff

18:08.540 --> 18:10.220
that sucks.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.820
Basically we already voted the worst Milani song in history on this program next to Let

18:13.820 --> 18:15.620
Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

18:15.620 --> 18:20.920
You'll never ever hear that song on our playlist, so we're only playing the good stuff.

18:20.920 --> 18:26.060
So if you have any requests, send us an email at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

18:26.060 --> 18:30.860
I've been getting a few new remixes here and there, some mixed things.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.340
I might play one of those later in the show.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.700
towards the end of the show I got one during the week it's very interesting

18:35.700 --> 18:39.380
it's a hybrid of two songs that you wouldn't imagine together so we might

18:39.380 --> 18:42.240
play that towards the end of the show if we got some time if you have any fan

18:42.240 --> 18:46.140
remixes go ahead and email me about sending those to me at orange lounge

18:46.140 --> 18:49.500
radio at yahoo.com and Jamie and I'll look them over and maybe we'll go ahead

18:49.500 --> 18:53.900
and put them in our playlist but I ask that they be you know kind of remixed a

18:53.900 --> 18:59.120
lot like don't just you know reloop the song in a sound editor take clips I'm

18:59.120 --> 19:02.640
adding like you know put some new instruments in there take some vocals do

19:02.640 --> 19:06.160
new things with it kind of remix it a little more than just you know five

19:06.160 --> 19:13.640
second remixing job what else I want to say there was something I don't know

19:13.640 --> 19:18.200
anyway I don't I don't make notes where are my notes I do have some notes let's

19:18.200 --> 19:23.860
see did I say I wanted to say something else about something they could email me

19:23.860 --> 19:27.560
about what are they paying you for nothing I don't get paid for this you

19:27.560 --> 19:28.560
Huh?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
I don't get paid for this.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
Isn't that a travesty?

19:30.560 --> 19:33.080
Well, where's my money?

19:33.080 --> 19:36.840
There was something else that I was going to say they could email me about.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.840
Ice cream?

19:37.840 --> 19:38.840
Requests.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.440
You can always email your requests if there's a song that you're not hearing in the Bomani

19:41.440 --> 19:45.160
Musical More program, or on this show you can always email us your requests and we'll

19:45.160 --> 19:46.880
get those to you as well.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
I'll think of it.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
It'll come to me later.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.200
Could it be songs that you'd like to hear in Bomani Musical More?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.200
Right, requests.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
Yes.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
Okay.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
Requests.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
I don't know.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Oh well.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.700
We're being demanded in the chat room to do this little segment that we usually do when

20:00.700 --> 20:05.040
Jamie's here, but when she's not here, we fill in for her. It's called the Fuck You

20:05.040 --> 20:10.540
of the Week. Does anybody have a Fuck You? I know I have a Fuck You of the Week.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.840
I have a collaborative Fuck You. A collaborative Fuck You of the Week. Alright,

20:13.840 --> 20:17.760
let's hear it. Your Fuck You of the Week. Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:17.760 --> 20:23.180
Sorry. That's Jamie's music. No. That's Jamie's FU music. I gotta play Matt's FU music. I'm

20:23.180 --> 20:28.700
I'm sorry. Matt's F.U. music is much better. No, no, no. Matt's F.U. music is much better.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.220
Agile will like this. You'll like this, Brad.

20:31.220 --> 20:39.220
Okay, now you can do your F.U. of the Week. I hate this fucking music.

20:39.340 --> 20:46.340
See? See? It makes him angry. Anyways, my F.U. of the Week has to go to Kaiser

20:46.340 --> 20:53.300
to go to Kaiser for renting out RVGL for the last three days what the hell I mean

20:53.300 --> 20:57.080
I've seen company parties last you know a day or something but why three days I

20:57.080 --> 21:04.500
mean it seems a little I can see why I used to work for Kaiser their ass holes

21:04.500 --> 21:09.860
fuck you yeah well they're not assholes I don't know I don't know anybody for

21:09.860 --> 21:13.160
there but you know they're rich enough cuz they're doctors and shit you know

21:13.160 --> 21:18.160
That's why they can, the only reason why they do this is because they can afford to.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.160
Yeah.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.160
What?

21:20.160 --> 21:22.920
The point is, what do they have to do at RBGL?

21:22.920 --> 21:25.040
I mean, they're not playing DDR, are they?

21:25.040 --> 21:31.400
You know, I'm imagining some physician trying DDR or Drummania or something, and he's like,

21:31.400 --> 21:36.200
whoa, rock out, yeah, you know, like reliving his youth because he's bald and, you know.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.800
I broke my fibula.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
Exactly.

21:38.800 --> 21:42.440
Exactly maybe they're doing research or something. I don't know

21:44.600 --> 21:51.640
For three days or maybe they're just too stupid and uh, you know just I don't know what I want to go down and party

21:51.640 --> 21:54.440
So we're just gonna leave the weekend open leave it open

21:54.440 --> 21:58.240
Well, I can say that also the folks that work at Kaiser work some pretty effed up schedules

21:58.240 --> 22:00.840
Like I have a friend that works there who's working at 1130 tonight

22:00.920 --> 22:05.380
So imagine you know if they were only doing it for one day and you had to work, you know

22:05.380 --> 22:06.740
That would kind of suck.

22:06.740 --> 22:11.320
So two days, but three days, and on the weekend, not only any weekend, but the weekend before

22:11.320 --> 22:15.680
school starts for most people, if it hasn't started already, it's kind of, what a bunch

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
of bitches.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.680
I mean, they must have had to pay.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
I was scheduling.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.320
My mom actually works for Kaiser.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.520
I don't get to see my mom for long stretches of time because I decide to go out in the

22:23.520 --> 22:24.520
daytime.

22:24.520 --> 22:29.640
That's when she's asleep because she works like 2.30 to 11 at night, and then weekends

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
too.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.600
So it's like, okay, hi mom, bye mom, see you later, walk by.

22:34.600 --> 22:39.840
it can be kind of screwed up. It's kind of like when dogs pee pee on trees

22:39.840 --> 22:44.280
and stuff, they're marking their territory, they're showing their power. That's what Kaiser's

22:44.280 --> 22:49.400
doing right now. They're showing their power. They're peeing on our DDR machine?

22:49.400 --> 22:51.960
If they do, I'm going to kick their ass. Oh my God.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.480
They're going to die. No health insurance can bring them back from

22:54.480 --> 23:00.840
the dead that I'll take them to or something like that. Somebody help me, quick.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.840
I told you to do it somewhere else.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.840
That sucked because I couldn't go down and play DDR down there all weekend long.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.840
I mean, I could understand missing out one day, but I haven't played in, like, a couple weeks.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.840
I'm starting to feel like drawls.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.840
Stop me with that goddamn song!

23:42.840 --> 23:45.840
Ugh! I hate that thing!

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
Kaiser steals your soul!

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
We are pizer!

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
Kaiser, wave!

23:53.840 --> 23:55.840
You didn't have that mic off, did you?

23:55.840 --> 23:56.840
No.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.840
Okay, yeah, don't turn it off, because it'll turn them both off.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.800
I didn't, just checking, just checking.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.760
We have some FUs from the chat room

24:02.760 --> 24:04.560
that would like to be shared with all of you out there.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.200
If you want to join our chat room,

24:06.200 --> 24:09.400
you're just going to join any other side IRC server.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.000
That's one of the servers in your list.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.280
If you have M-I-R-C, that's in your list.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.000
One example server you could join

24:15.000 --> 24:17.800
would be IRC.eggheads.org.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.040
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.740
And that is the same server, by the way,

24:22.740 --> 24:24.940
as most of the big Bamani channels,

24:24.940 --> 24:27.300
DDR Freak, 2DX Style, DDR Spot,

24:27.300 --> 24:31.300
I'll have their chat rooms over on Other Side IRC, and we do as well.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.300
Orange Lounge.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.940
Some FUs from the chat room.

24:33.940 --> 24:39.380
SoCalKicks says, fuck Pepsi Blue because it fucked up the camera that he borrowed from

24:39.380 --> 24:40.520
his friend.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.540
And I guess what he did is there's some kind of, it has a crappy cap on it, he says, that

24:44.540 --> 24:48.460
I guess must have went flying and conked the camera in just the right way, that one of

24:48.460 --> 24:51.980
the lines, the LED lines, doesn't work.

24:51.980 --> 24:54.300
And now he's in deep poopy.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.980
so uh... fuck you pepsi blue from socal kicks

24:57.980 --> 25:03.780
uh... a big fuck you from black lab to a minute extended mix because it's the

25:03.780 --> 25:06.020
song that he lost to on p a competition

25:06.020 --> 25:07.000
so

25:07.000 --> 25:08.980
fuck that song

25:08.980 --> 25:13.060
you know uh... it only takes a minute girl from max two yes

25:13.060 --> 25:15.180
uh...

25:15.180 --> 25:16.060
well that's

25:16.060 --> 25:20.460
what it's called extended mix whatever shut up brad

25:20.460 --> 25:25.780
uh... another f u uh... idiots who get balloons and suck the helium out and get

25:25.780 --> 25:27.300
on the second pad

25:27.300 --> 25:31.780
and talk without weird helium voice when i'm doing a cat up

25:31.780 --> 25:33.460
that's from twenty three one six

25:33.460 --> 25:38.220
i myself would find that quite humorous actually you know

25:38.220 --> 25:40.180
cat is it's it's kind of you know

25:40.180 --> 25:43.300
do you have to say it's it's getting a little repetitive you know it's get a

25:43.300 --> 25:44.660
little boring

25:44.660 --> 25:48.100
you know when the modifiers will shuffle it up enough you know get somebody on

25:48.100 --> 25:51.500
their talk with helium. They should have that kind of... That's an idea for Wednesday, write

25:51.500 --> 25:59.780
that down. The announcer starts speaking like he has a helium voice, that's what I do. That'd

25:59.780 --> 26:03.580
be funny, like, you know, some sort of modifiers that get the announcer to make fun of me.

26:03.580 --> 26:08.020
God, you fucking suck. Get out the damn pad. Yeah, what are you doing on the stage, you

26:08.020 --> 26:12.660
crack whore? Don't even put your money in, you're going to fail anyway. Before you even

26:12.660 --> 26:16.100
get on the machine

26:16.100 --> 26:19.420
that reminds me of we borrowed a i'd just

26:19.420 --> 26:23.420
recently acquired a jps you and got a copy of the are max that

26:23.420 --> 26:23.820
is

26:23.820 --> 26:26.620
theories crashed up so

26:26.620 --> 26:29.240
you know when you choose a song it's already doing you

26:29.240 --> 26:31.760
you have to take you to one

26:31.760 --> 26:34.980
and it's all right i was going to go on and it's

26:34.980 --> 26:39.000
it's it's not as a part of a combo mel had a combo about three hundred is

26:39.000 --> 26:45.480
started booing him out of nowhere. It was great. It was like The Exorcist meets DDR.

26:45.480 --> 26:49.080
Does it vomit pea soup if you get a certain combo?

26:49.080 --> 26:51.920
Maybe out of the memory card slot. I didn't try that.

26:51.920 --> 26:57.280
Ew. Maybe for a 666 combo.

26:57.280 --> 27:03.560
There is vomit coming out of the slot. Okay, anyways.

27:03.560 --> 27:08.440
Yeah, that would be pretty funny. Or even a great prank would be to hook up some sort

27:08.440 --> 27:14.460
of microphone or something to the actual speakers and when people are going in to put in money

27:14.460 --> 27:19.260
you start yelling through their own remote mics, say from the upper balcony from sun

27:19.260 --> 27:23.260
splash and you're just yelling down, you suck, get off the stage, and they're like what the

27:23.260 --> 27:24.260
hell?

27:24.260 --> 27:26.260
Well we can just do that from the balcony, we don't need a microphone.

27:26.260 --> 27:31.200
No, that brings up an idea though that I thought about when they had a guitar freaks and drum

27:31.200 --> 27:35.840
mania session is to have a microphone slot so you can do karaoke with them while they're

27:35.840 --> 27:37.480
playing.

27:37.480 --> 27:42.080
Of course, I wouldn't try to sing because I already know I suck, but Rob's really good.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.160
We should play one of your songs, Rob.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.720
No, we shouldn't.

27:47.720 --> 27:48.720
I'm...

27:48.720 --> 27:52.640
SoCal kicks in the chat rooms being an attention whore, and he's whining that I'm not...

27:52.640 --> 27:55.960
I didn't do his second part of his F.U. of the week, so here's his second part of the

27:55.960 --> 27:56.960
F.U. week.

27:56.960 --> 28:02.480
He says, fuck you to Echo for making $58 pants and $38 shirts.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.240
He spent $270 there yesterday.

28:04.240 --> 28:07.440
Well, if it bothers you, why didn't you spend $270 bucks?

28:07.440 --> 28:08.920
That's what I don't get.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.920
Go to Walmart and get $14 jeans.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.920
Ross.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.920
Ross.

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
That's what I'm saying, dude.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Ross.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
Target.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
Oh, I'm styling.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
I'm representing when I'm wearing my...

28:17.920 --> 28:21.480
Kmart has Joe Boxers now.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.560
Sweet.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.920
That's how you impress the ladies.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.920
Joe Boxer.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.920
Trust me.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.520
Just look at me.

28:27.520 --> 28:33.480
And uh, Tal gives a big F-you to guitar freaks.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.480
Because it's been broken.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.480
For a few weeks.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.480
Okay, but that's what we want.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.480
Does anybody else have an F.U.?

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
I think we've got all the F.U.'s.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.480
How do I have an F.U.?

28:42.480 --> 28:43.480
I have an F.U.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.480
Oh!

28:44.480 --> 28:45.480
I'm the special guest.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.480
Since you're the special guest, you get a song.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
You get a song, too.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
I have to find a song.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.480
No, no, no.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.480
We've already done Petite Love for somebody.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.480
Let's see.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.480
What am I doing?

28:53.480 --> 28:54.480
Let's see.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
What can I think?

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
I'm like all bouncy.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Okay, you know what?

28:57.480 --> 28:59.480
You know what I'll give you?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
Yeah!

29:00.480 --> 29:02.480
I'm going to give you Like A Virgin.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.480
You are such a liar!

29:04.480 --> 29:09.480
Anyone who knows me knows this is a trap.

29:09.480 --> 29:14.480
Anyway, my F.U. of the week is to Santana Row in San Jose.

29:14.480 --> 29:19.480
Anyone who's in the Bay Area knows Santana Row is this gigantic complex.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.480
It was going to be housing and shopping and all this shit.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.480
It burned down.

29:25.480 --> 29:33.480
You get to see this giant Santana Row opening September 19th with it in major flames in the background.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.800
background we're talking 11 alarms biggest fire in San Jose's history now

29:37.800 --> 29:41.560
the reason why this is a nephew of the week because I found out they were going

29:41.560 --> 29:44.780
to be charging for these condos okay they have condos in there fifteen

29:44.780 --> 29:49.960
thousand dollars a month who has that kind of money for a freaking condo every

29:49.960 --> 29:53.680
month so you know what I don't feel bad for them anymore because if they can

29:53.680 --> 29:57.560
find that kind of money to be charging for a condo they damn it they deserve it

29:57.560 --> 30:03.280
to be burned down preach on sister they have like golden toilets in there or

30:03.280 --> 30:15.000
I think we're going to go to a quick break and we'll come back and talk about some more

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
things.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.600
We're going to talk about USAs going bye-bye, being replaced with some new machines locally.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.960
We'll talk about that coming back from break.

30:23.960 --> 30:28.280
I'm going to do a request this break, this is a request I said I do last week and I didn't

30:28.280 --> 30:30.640
so my bad.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.680
I'll do it this week tonight.

30:32.680 --> 30:37.980
One other thing I did want to say before we go to break, when we said we're going to be

30:37.980 --> 30:42.180
taping next week's show this Wednesday at Roseville Golf Land, some people said, why

30:42.180 --> 30:44.200
don't you come out to the other golf lands?

30:44.200 --> 30:47.840
Actually, over this next weekend, while I'm out of town, I'm actually going to be in the

30:47.840 --> 30:51.060
bay, so it is very possible I'm going to be dropping into some golf lands.

30:51.060 --> 30:55.440
I know I'm going to be hitting Sunnyvale Golf Land, I just don't know what day.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.280
Maybe Sunday, maybe not.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.280
You're kicking something there, sweetie.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.280
Are you?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.280
Oh, no?

31:00.280 --> 31:01.280
Oh, okay.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.400
wasn't the router, because then the show would have just gone bye-bye.

31:03.400 --> 31:10.120
Anyway, yeah, I will be out doing some interviews at some of the Bay Area golf lands.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.760
I just don't know where and I don't know when just yet, but it will be sometime next weekend.

31:13.760 --> 31:17.600
I'll post an announcement somewhere appropriate when I know more about where I'm going to

31:17.600 --> 31:18.600
be.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.800
And if I run into you, I just might interview you for this program.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.180
Alright, let's go to break here.

31:24.180 --> 31:28.880
This is a request I meant to get to a few weeks, or last week, and I didn't, so here

31:28.880 --> 31:29.880
it is.

31:29.880 --> 31:36.880
Radio.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.880
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

32:02.880 --> 32:04.880
Take me any way you please

32:04.880 --> 32:06.880
Boy, you're making me scream

32:06.880 --> 32:09.880
Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da

32:09.880 --> 32:13.880
You gotta dream of your dream

32:13.880 --> 32:33.880
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, I'll just turn it up

32:33.880 --> 32:40.880
my friend No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get very honest is it

32:40.880 --> 33:02.880
Ooh, I like to dream, mama, do you like to scream?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.880
There's nothin' left to check the screen

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
If you wanna check the screen

33:06.880 --> 33:08.880
Boy, you're makin' me scream

33:08.880 --> 33:10.880
Ooh la da dee la da da

33:10.880 --> 33:12.880
Check me any way you please

33:12.880 --> 33:14.880
Boy, you're makin' me scream

33:14.880 --> 33:16.880

33:16.880 --> 33:40.000
We don't stop, we rock the spot, no We don't stop, we rock the spot, no

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Everybody over there, hands in the air

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
No, we don't quit, it's very hard to do it

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Dream a dream lover, take me in a dream

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
Take me anywhere you please, boy you're making me scream

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Dream a dream lover, life is just a dream

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
If you wanna set me free, boy you're making me scream

34:04.000 --> 34:06.800
Ooh, ya da dee, la da da

34:06.800 --> 34:08.800
Check me any way you think

34:08.800 --> 34:10.800
We're in the industry

34:10.800 --> 34:13.800
Ooh, ya da dee, la da da

34:13.800 --> 34:16.800
You gotta dream of me today

34:16.800 --> 34:36.800
Come on baby, let's dream a dream together

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
A dream that is real

34:40.800 --> 34:50.680
Dream a dream, nothing just a dream Take the every real thing, for you're making

34:50.680 --> 34:54.760
me scream Dream a dream, nothing just a dream

34:54.760 --> 34:56.760
If you want to let me be

35:18.260 --> 35:21.760
Looking back when I was a child and dream

35:21.760 --> 35:25.760
Moving my journey without me

35:25.760 --> 35:31.760
Having faith it will set me free and fly away

35:33.760 --> 35:36.760
Looking back when I wasn't sure I'm clear

35:36.760 --> 35:40.760
Causing my family taking come to me

35:40.760 --> 35:45.760
Having faith it will set me free and fly away to

35:45.760 --> 35:48.760
Everywhere

35:48.760 --> 35:52.760
I could do anything

35:54.760 --> 35:59.760
I can get up and I won't

36:00.760 --> 36:05.760
I get love from the one I love

36:06.760 --> 36:11.760
Hey baby, looking back when I wasn't shared and bled

36:11.760 --> 36:15.760
Those in my carry didn't come to me

36:15.760 --> 36:22.660
Not if it's easy and if we don't fly away

36:22.660 --> 36:26.920
I get so beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

36:26.920 --> 36:31.040
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful

36:31.040 --> 36:33.280
portable

36:34.860 --> 36:39.380
After a long time come to be a man

36:39.380 --> 37:01.540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.620
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, or at least most of you were.

37:04.620 --> 37:09.020
I'm just hearing in the chatroom that there was a dump, and most of you got dumped, and

37:09.020 --> 37:12.860
And I can tell that most of you got dumped because my listener count updated and there's

37:12.860 --> 37:16.620
a whopping one person listening at this very moment.

37:16.620 --> 37:17.620
And it's probably me.

37:17.620 --> 37:18.620
It must count me.

37:18.620 --> 37:19.620
We love you, one person.

37:19.620 --> 37:20.620
Yeah, we love you, one listener.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.620
I don't know what happened.

37:21.620 --> 37:25.800
Live 365 must have taken a dump or something and you all got dumped as a result of it.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.540
So I apologize.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.460
But it sounds like if you all reconnected, of course, obviously if you're hearing this,

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
you did reconnect.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.060
So there's no point in me saying.

37:34.060 --> 37:37.940
So tell anyone who was listening it got dumped that you got to reconnect and sorry about

37:37.940 --> 37:44.380
So Cal Kicks says he's the one listener.

37:44.380 --> 37:47.740
I don't know though, it updated and then he said he got dumped, so I don't know.

37:47.740 --> 37:52.320
I think one person managed to stay connected and the other ones that we had on there dropped,

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
so I don't know.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
That's crazy.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.580
When you said you had to take a dump during the break, I didn't know.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.580
Not like that.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.220
High mouth humor.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.940
So I've been trying to make some new promos for you.

38:02.940 --> 38:04.460
You like the Captain Jack one?

38:04.460 --> 38:10.460
Alright, Melody about to pee her pants on there, that's good.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.780
When Melody soils herself?

38:11.780 --> 38:12.780
I don't know.

38:12.780 --> 38:16.140
Well, I mean, it's good that she liked it so much, it's not, you know, if she peed her

38:16.140 --> 38:20.700
pants that wouldn't really be a good thing, I'd have to, you know, clean the carpet and

38:20.700 --> 38:22.940
get smell in here.

38:22.940 --> 38:28.460
Can we go one night without potty humor?

38:28.460 --> 38:29.900
No.

38:29.900 --> 38:34.440
Potty humor, potty haaaat.

38:34.440 --> 38:44.400
One thing we wanted to talk about, some news that we got this week.

38:44.400 --> 38:50.080
At the Golf Land chain, which is a pretty big chain out here in the west coast of arcades

38:50.080 --> 38:56.840
in California and Arizona, where one could argue that DDR was kind of born and nurtured

38:56.840 --> 39:01.480
between the Golf Lands and the Metreon and some other locations like Arcade Infinity.

39:01.480 --> 39:08.960
was one of the big players in getting DDR exposure. Most of their arcades have a Dance

39:08.960 --> 39:12.880
Dance Revolution USA machine, and then some other kind of mix. Most of them have Max 2

39:12.880 --> 39:18.080
by now, I believe. The news came over this week, and this still should be considered

39:18.080 --> 39:22.320
a rumor until these machines are actually there and in place, but for all practical

39:22.320 --> 39:27.100
purposes, it's pretty much been confirmed, all the USAs are going out and being replaced

39:27.100 --> 39:33.660
with 4th Plus machines. So, which is good news because 4th Plus is a very cool mix.

39:33.660 --> 39:35.980
It's much better than USA, that's for sure.

39:35.980 --> 39:38.100
I don't know, man. I like USA.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.940
You like your one foot songs, one foot freestyles, huh?

39:40.940 --> 39:45.380
Man, what am I going to do now if I can't play anything greater than a one footer? I

39:45.380 --> 39:48.940
mean, what am I going to do? I'm screwed.

39:48.940 --> 39:52.780
You can't play B.O.L. over and over.

39:52.780 --> 39:56.980
Does that mean that El Remo Tropical is going to finally get a rest? That they don't just

39:56.980 --> 40:00.820
hit the first song that they see you know because if you we found this out

40:00.820 --> 40:03.900
when we had fourth mix if you just keep hitting the first category that's up

40:03.900 --> 40:14.300
have you never been mellow just like the old days so and apparently fourth plus

40:14.300 --> 40:19.500
bootleg kits are only like $200 if even that 175 bucks I mean I'm being told in

40:19.500 --> 40:25.940
chat room, so pretty darn cheap.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
What do you think this means?

40:26.940 --> 40:30.620
This is very interesting that USA is kind of disappearing, I guess there's always been

40:30.620 --> 40:35.420
this kind of urban legend, urban Bimani legend, I don't think there's any truth to it personally,

40:35.420 --> 40:41.300
but they've always kind of said that, oh well, Konami doesn't really mind the Max 2s and

40:41.300 --> 40:45.080
the import mixes as long as they keep the USA machine there too, you know, they're kind

40:45.080 --> 40:47.700
of supporting the USA Bimani.

40:47.700 --> 40:51.140
look at Stockman Golf Land, they never had a USA machine, very true, very true, import

40:51.140 --> 40:55.020
machines. Like I said, I think it was all just kind of hearsay, but you look at the

40:55.020 --> 40:58.800
Metreon, they're not allowed to have anything but USA machines. You can argue the movie

40:58.800 --> 41:03.300
theater upstairs has two Max 2s now, but they're not owned by the rest of the Metreon, they're

41:03.300 --> 41:07.460
leased or whatever, so they don't have to play by those rules. You know what I think

41:07.460 --> 41:14.140
about it? Bullshit! What, the bullshit that they had to have a USA for an import? Does

41:14.140 --> 41:17.860
Does anybody else find it really odd that Konami, I mean Max 2 is, they are literally

41:17.860 --> 41:23.260
everywhere now, everywhere, there's DDR everywhere and there's pretty much no USA machines left.

41:23.260 --> 41:27.740
It's pretty obvious that Konami is not putting out a new USA mix anytime soon unless they

41:27.740 --> 41:29.180
do it kind of out of thin air.

41:29.180 --> 41:32.880
It's going to be something they announce and have out on the street within a month.

41:32.880 --> 41:38.660
All the new USA stuffs for the home mix, obviously we had all that stuff a while back about Konami

41:38.660 --> 41:42.660
closing their coin-op office and all this, but that doesn't mean, you know, that doesn't

41:42.660 --> 41:47.660
I mean, Konami coin-op is shutting down completely. They're just going to have a third-party distributor, most likely.

41:47.660 --> 41:54.660
Let's just put it this way. I mean, if you put a 1-5 machine and a USA machine next to each other, it's like comparing two JOGA songs.

41:54.660 --> 41:59.660
Sure, they're going to be a little bit different, but it's not much better. It's just pretty much the same thing.

41:59.660 --> 42:07.660
So, it just, USA sucks. Everyone's tired of playing it. They're like, eh, oh, yay. I'm like, 20 songs I get to choose from.

42:07.660 --> 42:15.660
Let's see, 20 songs or like 100 and some songs? 20, 100 and something. That's a tough one.

42:15.660 --> 42:20.660
I think, I mean, and plus you got Battle Mode. Battle Mode's cool.

42:20.660 --> 42:27.660
Although the little kids will fail faster. So, you know, they'll get off the fucking machine so I can play.

42:27.660 --> 42:28.660
So, yeah.

42:28.660 --> 42:29.660
Yes.

42:29.660 --> 42:30.660
Excellent.

42:30.660 --> 42:35.980
Is this kind of weird to anyone else that Konami just doesn't seem to care, that the

42:35.980 --> 42:39.860
economy of USA does not seem to care that all these Japanese mixers are coming in and

42:39.860 --> 42:40.860
taking over?

42:40.860 --> 42:45.420
And if they do put out a USA second mix, it's going to have to be damn good or else nobody's

42:45.420 --> 42:46.420
going to blink an eye.

42:46.420 --> 42:50.420
Well, it might not be that they don't care, but you know, Imports, sure, they're not bringing

42:50.420 --> 42:53.060
money to KOA, but they're still getting exposure to it.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.060
Exactly.

42:54.060 --> 42:55.060
And bringing in the PlayStation.

42:55.060 --> 42:56.060
Exactly.

42:56.060 --> 42:59.900
other places like we're used to having a million DDRs all over the place but

42:59.900 --> 43:03.580
I'm sitting here thinking okay I have grandparents and family in the Midwest

43:03.580 --> 43:07.580
and Missouri if I want to go back there anytime I'm not gonna be playing DDR

43:07.580 --> 43:11.780
because there is none within like 75 miles of the town they live in and it's

43:11.780 --> 43:14.660
one of the bigger towns back there some of these people only see it on their

43:14.660 --> 43:18.060
vacation they only see it like if they're going on a trip for some reason

43:18.060 --> 43:21.780
they don't have the option to just drive five minutes to a golf land and play DDR

43:21.780 --> 43:25.700
they're gonna see an import but be like hey that's cool and go buy it for the US

43:25.700 --> 43:26.980
playstation

43:26.980 --> 43:30.400
it's kind of odd that they're using the japanese machines to do their promotion

43:30.400 --> 43:33.460
for the u s a mixes i mean

43:33.460 --> 43:38.080
it obviously if they don't profit from these u s mixes on on the home versions

43:38.080 --> 43:39.920
they're not going to keep going with it

43:39.920 --> 43:42.700
true but look what they have to work with

43:42.700 --> 43:47.740
technically supposed to have to work with is the u s versions right

43:47.740 --> 43:51.180
let's just put it this way how much does it cost licensed music in japan

43:51.180 --> 43:54.320
versus how much does it cost very true which is a big thing to say here

43:54.320 --> 43:59.560
although Max is going to be pretty cool because it's got 20 new licensed songs, not in any

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
other mix of DDR.

44:00.560 --> 44:05.640
They knew that USA wasn't anything special or great or anything and I think that they

44:05.640 --> 44:10.400
realized that all the imports are getting all the business and they're not even going

44:10.400 --> 44:15.880
to bother because they know we're fine with all of the imports.

44:15.880 --> 44:19.840
On a somewhat related subject, we have in the chat room, Roo makes a very good point

44:19.840 --> 44:20.840
here.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.000
Why is it that no one ever watches The Good People on Max 2, they always watch The Newbies

44:24.000 --> 44:30.580
on USA. If you see a USA mix right next to a Max 2, nobody is ever watching. You could

44:30.580 --> 44:34.360
be playing the hardest catastrophic on that. You could be playing Max Unlimited over on

44:34.360 --> 44:38.520
the Max 2 machine. Somebody right next to you is doing so many men one-footer and they're

44:38.520 --> 44:44.300
getting a huge crowd. Why is that? Because no one can read the arrows if they're new

44:44.300 --> 44:49.520
to it and they're watching people doing catastrophic. The other thing I thought of is also, well

44:49.520 --> 44:53.520
Well, we all started back somewhere. It kind of brings us back to the nostalgia of,

44:53.520 --> 44:56.520
wow, I remember when that song was hard, now look what I'm doing.

44:56.520 --> 45:03.520
And a lot of people see a lot of Catastropics. There's honestly not that many newbies anymore.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.520
They're just the people waiting up to go play.

45:06.520 --> 45:09.520
And so, you know, you figure, okay, the guy that's playing the Catastropics

45:09.520 --> 45:12.520
is probably going to pass this song, the next song, the song after that,

45:12.520 --> 45:14.520
whereas the newbie is probably going to fail pretty soon.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.520
Who's going to get up to play first?

45:17.520 --> 45:21.360
So you think it's kind of like an assembling of the wolves thing, like, let's watch them

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
fail.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.360
You know?

45:23.360 --> 45:26.720
Yeah, and that when you throw stuff at people, but yeah.

45:26.720 --> 45:30.840
It's somebody else on Twitter, Black Lab says it could be American Pride, it's just they

45:30.840 --> 45:36.680
see USA, it's just like, hey, it's a red, white, and blue mix, we gotta support that.

45:36.680 --> 45:40.980
Yeah, on the next machine they put in, like on the fourth plus, they should say, fuck

45:40.980 --> 45:44.200
you American capitalist pigs on the thing, so that they don't look at them anymore.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.200
Maybe they'll stop looking at us.

45:46.200 --> 45:47.200
Yeah.

45:47.200 --> 45:52.160
like the attention I thought you were attention or bread no no no put down your

45:52.160 --> 45:57.440
microphone Rob no but give me your microphone this is the Brad show all

45:57.440 --> 46:02.040
Brad all the time thank you here I mean you can join you know what they should

46:02.040 --> 46:10.560
put on the next mix of DDR and like country West on dancing oh no oh god he's

46:10.560 --> 46:20.960
he's got a sound clip. Oh, he's gonna play something. Oh, sorry. I mean, didn't you just

46:20.960 --> 46:28.920
hear this? Oh, damn it, Rob. I'm gonna burn down your trailer. What is that? Oh, it's

46:28.920 --> 46:39.600
the all American DDR. You might be a rednecks. Does this version of DDR have like, you know,

46:39.600 --> 46:44.320
cars on it too

46:44.320 --> 46:49.600
yes it's DDR mixed with silent scope

46:49.600 --> 46:53.400
DDR mix and duck hunt, thank you melody

46:53.400 --> 46:57.000
complete with the dancing dog that you can't fucking kill no matter what you do

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
well they need to have in the background the guy calling out the square dance commands and stuff

47:01.000 --> 47:03.840
in the background there

47:03.840 --> 47:06.080
everybody do-si-do

47:06.080 --> 47:09.200
up, down, up, down

47:09.200 --> 47:13.200
word and

47:13.200 --> 47:16.760
don't forget you have to like

47:16.760 --> 47:19.520
drink and smoke too much

47:19.520 --> 47:23.280
i'd just got booted from i r c so i have no idea if this broadcast is still

47:23.280 --> 47:27.360
going i i think we are i think we're ok was to keep going like we're doing a

47:27.360 --> 47:28.640
normal show will see what happens

47:28.640 --> 47:31.040
who home do you know

47:31.040 --> 47:34.520
if not it's one for the monday night archives i guess that

47:34.520 --> 47:35.600
i don't know

47:35.600 --> 47:37.880
which is odd because it's not even trying to reconnect that might just be

47:37.880 --> 47:41.840
i r c blow up so uh... these connect will see

47:41.840 --> 47:44.180
okay i don't know what's going on to keep going

47:44.180 --> 47:46.300
uh... all of the show

47:46.300 --> 47:50.380
so i was playing at the idea of the other day

47:50.380 --> 47:52.780
i felt this weird feeling in my uh...

47:52.780 --> 47:59.780
acts and i was like so max three hundred

47:59.780 --> 48:05.780
Sorry, I'm sorry, but we're trying to remedy the IRC situation.

48:05.780 --> 48:09.460
All I know is, I'm not very comfortable at this moment right now.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.460
That's all I have to say.

48:10.460 --> 48:16.020
Did you ever see that scene in Screamers where the guy's head exploded?

48:16.020 --> 48:19.780
I'm having a very good time, people like me.

48:19.780 --> 48:27.780
Thank you, I think that's what I was on, you need to do the other server.

48:27.780 --> 48:28.780
Rob?

48:28.780 --> 48:30.780
Let Bradley take care of it.

48:30.780 --> 48:32.780
Let Bradley work on the situation.

48:32.780 --> 48:35.780
I'm kind of monitoring the broadcast to see if we lose our listeners again, because it might be us.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.780
I don't know. We'll see.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.780
Anyway.

48:39.780 --> 48:41.780
Code red! Code red! The building's on fire!

48:43.780 --> 48:47.780
And if you don't reconnect to IRC, I'm going to set the building on fire.

48:47.780 --> 48:49.780
Okay, that's Milton from Office Space for anyone who didn't know.

48:51.780 --> 48:55.780
It's been confirmed the Taliban have attacked Orange Lounge Radio.

48:55.780 --> 48:58.780
hahahaha

48:58.780 --> 49:02.020
do not be afraid

49:02.020 --> 49:05.860
uh... we we got the i r c situation fixed a little underline everybody be

49:05.860 --> 49:06.780
alert

49:06.780 --> 49:07.920
are you alert

49:07.920 --> 49:10.420
i'm alert

49:10.420 --> 49:14.060
what is alert i want to know what alert what happens when she breaks down as

49:14.060 --> 49:17.540
everybody goes nuts you know we have very alert

49:17.540 --> 49:20.540
excuse me can i check we know about jamie here tonight it would all fall

49:20.540 --> 49:22.340
apart so just you know

49:22.340 --> 49:25.140
Fuck the show! Let's just have random quote night.

49:25.140 --> 49:29.140
Maybe we should all go join her with a warp core breach in Vegas. Road trip!

49:31.140 --> 49:38.140
Little does Jamie realize we are standing behind her as she is seeing it right now. Won't she be surprised?

49:39.140 --> 49:43.140
I'm hoping to get the phone thing so I really want the phones on this show because I want to be able...

49:43.140 --> 49:47.340
I don't so much want people to be able to call us, but I want to be able to call other people.

49:47.340 --> 49:53.340
I'm really skeptical of having random people call this show because there's, I mean, no

49:53.340 --> 49:56.020
offense to anybody listening, because I'm sure you're all intelligent, but there's really

49:56.020 --> 49:59.700
a lot of idiots out there in the Beaumont community I don't want calling this show.

49:59.700 --> 50:06.540
Why don't you just have a phone in here and put it on speaker and dial out or something?

50:06.540 --> 50:07.540
Yeah?

50:07.540 --> 50:08.540
Well, I don't know.

50:08.540 --> 50:09.880
It would sound kind of crappy.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.740
It might work, but it would be kind of crappy.

50:11.740 --> 50:14.020
But of course, we do have two microphones.

50:14.020 --> 50:17.180
The only problem is, it might sound kind of weird for the person on the other end.

50:17.180 --> 50:23.060
it might work, we could try it. Well, I could maybe borrow something that I have at work

50:23.060 --> 50:27.180
that we could hook up to the phone line where we could plug it into. I always like it when

50:27.180 --> 50:31.820
people want to steal things from work for the show. Oh, I'm sorry, long-term borrow.

50:31.820 --> 50:38.820
Oh, borrow? I have a paper clip from work. Anyways, back on the... Our chat room is foaming

50:38.820 --> 50:41.820
Anyways, um, back on the, uh...

50:41.820 --> 50:43.820
Our chat room was foaming at the mouth with the idea of phones.

50:43.820 --> 50:45.820
Here, I'll call, let's call, let's call.

50:45.820 --> 50:49.820
Anyways, yeah, we should probably be back on the, uh, on topic here.

50:49.820 --> 50:52.820
I remember, actually, something was said in the chat room that jolted...

50:52.820 --> 50:54.820
Remember that thing I was trying to think of earlier that I couldn't think of,

50:54.820 --> 50:58.820
why I wanted people to email me at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com?

50:58.820 --> 50:59.820
No.

50:59.820 --> 51:00.820
If...

51:00.820 --> 51:05.820
Some people were listening last week to our dollar mendi coverage of that tournament that happened a couple weeks ago.

51:05.820 --> 51:11.820
If you want to cover a local tournament in your area, if you've got a tape recorder, you can get some decent sound.

51:11.820 --> 51:18.820
If you want to cover a tournament in your area, go ahead and make a 5-10 minute news piece on your local tournament.

51:18.820 --> 51:22.820
And we'll feature it here on Orange Lounge Radio. If you can make an MP3 of it, send it to us.

51:22.820 --> 51:25.820
Because we'd love to hear it. We don't want this to just be a California or Sacramento show.

51:25.820 --> 51:29.820
This is for everybody, especially if you're not even in America at all.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.820
If you're one of our listeners over in Europe or Japan or whatever,

51:32.820 --> 51:36.820
Definitely, tape something over there and send it to us. We'd love to play it on the show.

51:36.820 --> 51:40.820
Get in touch with me at OrangeLoungeRadio.Yahoo.com and we'll give you all the information.

51:40.820 --> 51:45.820
In the chatroom, I know that you posted my edits. In fact, I saw that you didn't have the names on there,

51:45.820 --> 51:50.820
so I sent you another email with the names. And they're also in the zip files, all the information about the edits.

51:50.820 --> 51:54.820
Check that out.

51:54.820 --> 52:01.820
Well, I was still kind of going on this 4th Plus thing now that we realized we haven't lost the whole damn show.

52:01.820 --> 52:08.100
Do you think 4th Plus is the best choice to replace USA or why?

52:08.100 --> 52:10.780
Because it's like the best mix.

52:10.780 --> 52:13.700
It's got like pretty much a little bit of everything.

52:13.700 --> 52:19.820
You're going to find most of the songs from other mixes before 4th on there and it doesn't

52:19.820 --> 52:23.620
have any of the crap songs on there.

52:23.620 --> 52:27.980
Also a lot of stuff that was on 5th Mix or anything like that is already on Max 2 anyways.

52:27.980 --> 52:29.820
Like most of the stuff that was good.

52:29.820 --> 52:30.820
What about the fifth mix?

52:30.820 --> 52:31.820
Yeah.

52:31.820 --> 52:34.580
So, I mean, fourth plus seems pretty good.

52:34.580 --> 52:39.820
I think it probably has one of the most, you know, the largest, you know, sound collections.

52:39.820 --> 52:42.820
You're not going to miss all the third Koreans that get replaced?

52:42.820 --> 52:43.820
Wah!

52:43.820 --> 52:44.820
Wah!

52:44.820 --> 52:48.820
Do they take out all the fifth Korean songs?

52:48.820 --> 52:50.820
Well, only half.

52:50.820 --> 52:55.500
You know, the non-third plus Korean songs like Starion, Hoggism, those ones are not

52:55.500 --> 52:56.500
going to be there.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.500
Those weren't in fourth anyways.

52:57.500 --> 53:00.500
Yeah, Baquah. They're in there. Yeah, fourth plus.

53:00.500 --> 53:02.500
Ooh, Baquah. Oh, yeah.

53:02.500 --> 53:06.500
Don't you just want to play beautiful 21C over and over and over and over?

53:06.500 --> 53:08.500
Because I know people that do that.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
You know what?

53:10.500 --> 53:11.500
Oh, yeah.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.500
Oh, good point. Good point.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.500
Twen in the chat room says,

53:14.500 --> 53:17.500
fifth mix is slightly better because it does not have let them move.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.500
Good point.

53:18.500 --> 53:22.500
You'll just not play it.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
But anyways.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.500
Yes, Brad.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.500
I don't have anything to say.

53:26.500 --> 53:36.500
the microphone. You don't ask for the microphone, you don't have anything to say. Let's play

53:36.500 --> 53:40.580
what is this link I'm being sent in the chat room. I'm guessing it's for an upgrade to

53:40.580 --> 53:45.620
fourth plus and showing how expensive it is. Ah no no, somebody is selling their screen

53:45.620 --> 53:53.900
name of Satan. Super elite. You know what's funny is that one of my good friends is Morpheus

53:53.900 --> 54:02.400
on AOL, and he's had this for years and years. Of course, right after The Matrix comes out,

54:02.400 --> 54:06.900
about 50 different Neos start messaging the poor guy, you know, going, oh, I'm Neo, you're

54:06.900 --> 54:11.500
Morpheus, where's the pills, da-da-da. Just like stupid 10-year-old kids thinking that,

54:11.500 --> 54:16.700
you know, I don't know, a random thought. Actually, it's probably, like, 30-year-old

54:16.700 --> 54:21.420
guys now, like, have nothing to worry about. Chatroom has a tendency to be able to derail

54:21.420 --> 54:23.420
the show in like two seconds, flat.

54:23.420 --> 54:28.900
If you want to join our chat room, any other side IRC server, channel poundorangelounge.

54:28.900 --> 54:34.460
I have a different topic if- Go for it, what do you want to talk about?

54:34.460 --> 54:38.220
I was thinking about another tournament here in Sacramento.

54:38.220 --> 54:41.100
Okay, yeah, we want to do one, yeah, so.

54:41.100 --> 54:43.060
So when are we going to do one?

54:43.060 --> 54:44.900
Well, when the place is let us.

54:44.900 --> 54:50.700
There's some things going on at one of the local arcades is looking into getting a brand

54:50.700 --> 54:54.860
new machine you know what I'm talking about a very wanted machine but we don't

54:54.860 --> 54:57.500
know if it's going out with kind of one of those things where we aren't trusting

54:57.500 --> 55:00.740
the rumor until we see it for ourselves there in the arcade which is you know

55:00.740 --> 55:04.560
what most people should do instead of spreading rumors um we're kind of

55:04.560 --> 55:07.340
waiting to see if they get that machine because if they do get that machine we

55:07.340 --> 55:11.900
want to have it there and do two kinds of tournaments do DDR and for the other

55:11.900 --> 55:16.220
machine because there's a lot of demand for that kind of tournament I know what

55:16.220 --> 55:18.220
That's what that new machine is.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.220
Boonga Boonga.

55:20.220 --> 55:26.220
Yes! Boonga Boonga Tournament. Very first. MAMBO Tournaments!

55:26.220 --> 55:29.220
Okay, but no.

55:34.220 --> 55:43.220
But anyway, what about our Bimani liaison that's over at RVGL that's supposed to be set up a tournament.

55:43.220 --> 55:46.060
knows how to set up a tournament, but I smelled alcohol in his breath.

55:46.060 --> 55:47.060
No, I'm just kidding.

55:47.060 --> 55:48.060
I didn't.

55:48.060 --> 55:49.060
I didn't.

55:49.060 --> 55:50.060
Sorry, what?

55:50.060 --> 55:51.060
Did he drink vanilla coke?

55:51.060 --> 55:53.940
Would you please explain the vanilla coke and alcohol joke for our listeners?

55:53.940 --> 55:59.380
Okay, so Irene is sitting here as we're coming into the show with a glass of vanilla coke

55:59.380 --> 56:02.500
and ice asking everyone, does this taste like alcohol?

56:02.500 --> 56:04.860
We're trying to figure out if someone spiked your vanilla coke.

56:04.860 --> 56:05.860
We're still not quite sure.

56:05.860 --> 56:11.020
It was like, seriously, I've never had vanilla coke with ice in it before, but it tastes

56:11.020 --> 56:17.020
It's so strange now. It seems like someone put alcohol or GHB or something in it.

56:17.020 --> 56:19.020
I'm kidding.

56:19.020 --> 56:22.020
I gave you the date rape drug, Irene.

56:22.020 --> 56:25.020
I want to go to my room and get fresh.

56:25.020 --> 56:29.020
Oh, that's how you got pregnant.

56:29.020 --> 56:38.020
Well, we weren't going to mention it now, but next segment, Irene's going to be on our webcam.

56:38.020 --> 56:42.020
Hey, we have to earn the money to play those songs somehow.

56:42.020 --> 56:46.020
Yeah, okay, yes, oh yeah, oh yeah, that topic, yes.

56:46.020 --> 56:47.020
Yes, Irene.

56:47.020 --> 56:51.020
Isn't it kind of boring to have PA and freestyle anymore?

56:51.020 --> 56:56.020
Well, I think it's kind of one of those things where you have to.

56:56.020 --> 57:03.020
I like the idea of doing PA, freestyle, and then something experimental, or at least kind of shaking up the rules enough that it keeps it interesting, you know?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.460
as opposed to like, you know,

57:04.460 --> 57:08.260
we're just gonna qualify in the top 16, I'll play head-to-head,

57:08.260 --> 57:11.300
and then we'll have a winner. Wild Jerble PA.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.540
What?

57:13.540 --> 57:15.140
Wild Jerble PA.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.100
You're just gonna let loose Wild Jerbles on the machine?

57:17.100 --> 57:19.980
Or if somebody messes up, it's just gonna be BOOM!

57:19.980 --> 57:22.300
Boonga Boonga!

57:22.300 --> 57:25.980
Oh yeah. You know, I'm thinking like, you know,

57:25.980 --> 57:27.940
routines are good.

57:27.940 --> 57:31.140
You know, people can spend a lot of time and prepare

57:31.140 --> 57:34.640
their routines instead of someone going up, oh, you know, I think I'm the shit and I'm

57:34.640 --> 57:38.960
just going to pay my five dollars in PA or something. I think routines. We should focus

57:38.960 --> 57:45.260
strongly on routines. Like, you know, people actually thinking of something to do and,

57:45.260 --> 57:49.560
you know, making it look nice and stuff as opposed to someone just doing hand slaps and

57:49.560 --> 57:50.960
all that stupid shit.

57:50.960 --> 57:54.440
I agree. We saw some real shitty routines at SCAT and that's because I can tell you

57:54.440 --> 57:57.160
why. It was from the people who would get up there at the registration desk, because

57:57.160 --> 58:00.120
I was sitting there at the registration desk, and there would be those people that would

58:00.120 --> 58:07.120
up and go, well I don't know if I should enter improv freestyle or routine freestyle. Well,

58:07.760 --> 58:12.960
what song could I do a routine to? It's like eleven o'clock that morning and they're just

58:12.960 --> 58:16.000
going to pull a routine out of their butt, they have no step charts with them.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.600
I don't know anything, I don't know what you're talking about there Rob, it's not like I got

58:21.600 --> 58:25.040
up there thinking I had memorized the song and it fucked it all up.

58:25.040 --> 58:28.560
It's wonderful because if you saw Loki enter the tournament I think he was one of two people

58:28.560 --> 58:35.520
to fail his song. And he actually knows the song he was doing by heart, and he knows it

58:35.520 --> 58:42.080
on stealth and everything. I'm sad to see that you, by technicality, place underneath

58:42.080 --> 58:45.080
some of those other people, but you know, it's just technicality.

58:45.080 --> 58:58.800
I was thinking, like, maybe we can have a DDR Couples routine thing.

58:58.800 --> 59:03.880
Well, you've seen that done before, like, you mean like, couples who sleep together?

59:03.880 --> 59:06.800
Yes, couples that suck.

59:06.800 --> 59:08.720
But you know, this is the thing.

59:08.720 --> 59:13.120
Well, you got them, she's suggesting that Rice Princess and Michael Stoudier are a couple.

59:13.120 --> 59:15.120
Yeah, I don't know about that.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.120
A couple of what? I don't know.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.120
A group thing.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.120
What? What the what?

59:21.120 --> 59:23.120
No, okay, this is what I was thinking.

59:23.120 --> 59:25.120
Yeah, sweetie, I get it.

59:25.120 --> 59:26.120
Shut up.

59:26.120 --> 59:28.120
I don't know if our bed's big enough.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.120
Hey, punch you in your throat.

59:30.120 --> 59:32.120
Whoa, shit.

59:32.120 --> 59:38.120
What I was going to say is that this is going to sound very discriminating, but there is a reason why I would say it.

59:38.120 --> 59:41.240
i would think only that the couples and it would only be

59:41.240 --> 59:43.080
male female

59:43.080 --> 59:47.520
and only because you know that there's going to be to go later pater no no no

59:47.520 --> 59:51.160
this is why here's my rationalization discriminator your discriminator here

59:51.160 --> 59:51.920
might be

59:51.920 --> 59:52.560
too

59:52.560 --> 59:55.240
really good guys that are going to pretend to be

59:55.240 --> 59:57.980
day or something and what i entered together

59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.780
and you know do some routine and blow away everyone else

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.200
the only that's all

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.720
blow up a little a hot hot hot

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.640
the only issue i see with that though is that you know male-female

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:15.040
honestly there aren't that many female freestylers out there so it kinda makes it kinda difficult

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.880
but hey i think i'd pay money to see mel b act gay with some other guy

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.780
hahahaha

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.380
that was not good

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.500
okay once again mel b is not gay

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:30.260
i know he's not i have proof to you but i'd pay money to watch him act that way

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.660
just watch him pop pop

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.660
Oh, you're right. I saw that.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.660
What about females and females?

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.660
You know, two females wanted to get on there and do some secret rendezvous action.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.660
No, I'm kidding.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660
Hater!

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660
No, no, no.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660
Homophobe!

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.660
No!

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
I hate you!

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660
I hate you, Rob!

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.660
Sit down. You don't know me.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.660
Why do they get silent all of a sudden?

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.660
Every time I talk.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.660
God.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.660
Fuck you, log!

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.660
Is that such an inside joke?

01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.660
No.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:03.660
Unfortunately, no, we haven't dropped.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.660
Actually, we're at a ratings peak right now, I don't know why.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.660
We haven't brought up shirtless Emi or anything, but somehow...

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.660
No, that's three-titted Emi, okay? Get it right.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.660
Speaking of which, Konami hasn't released any more of the DDRPC characters.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.660
Very disappointing.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:26.660
Valencia and Guy, last week. Pack number two did come out last week.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.660
We covered that last week. I'm talking about number 3.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.660
We thought they'd be doing them every Friday and they missed a Friday. Shame, shame.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.660
It'll probably be out on Monday instead.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.660
They're trying to get Paul Terry to do the motion capture.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.660
What do you want to bet Paul Terry is one of the unlockable characters?

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.660
Nice.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.660

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.540
Yes, I am. Now, because there's a lot of people's fantasies to own their own machine, you know,

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.860
I don't know what they, as they're thinking about late at night, as they're following

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:42.860
Is it everything it's cracked up to be?

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:47.860
Does this machine vibrate?

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.860
If you jump on it really hard, yes it does.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:57.860
Anyone?

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.860
What made you want to get a DDR machine?

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.860
I like DDR and Mel needed to get rid of it.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:12.860
So I talked really nice with my mom and said, Mom, I need money.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.860
She gave me money and I bought it.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.860
I did it the lazy way.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.860
How often do you use it?

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.860
It kind of depends on what I'm doing.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.860
If I'm kind of busy during the week, I'm like, eh, whatever.

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.860
Now you have a Solo 2000 machine, correct?

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:28.860
I have a Solo 2000.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:34.860
Since you got your Solo 2000 machine, have you played Solo 2000 in the arcade at all?

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.860
No, because there's only one in San Jose, and I don't know where it is even.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.860
It's in the middle of a Super Kmart, I think.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.860
You know, they just got a brand new one right at the street here in the mall.

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:48.860
Yeah, I should probably look at that, but why pay for it when I can set it to six songs for free?

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.860
Well, honestly, I'm just curious, because a lot of people say,

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.860
oh, even if I had a machine at home, I'd probably still play in the arcade occasionally.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:02.860
Now, of course, you do play in the arcade still Max 2 because it's not the same as Solo 2000.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.860
There's almost nothing, you know.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:11.860
Solo has a lot of songs that don't appear on any other mix, like My Baby Mama, stuff like that.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.860
So, you know, strut your funky stuff and lots of stuff.

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.860
And it's not like you can play 6 panel.

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.860
That's Glenn's favorite song.

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:22.860
It's not like you can play 6 panel much anywhere else, too, which I'm just teaching myself how to do.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:27.580
I play it normally, it depends on what I'm doing, I can play it anywhere from every day

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.980
in a week to not even once a week, but it's just in my backyard, I'm bored I'm going to

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:33.980
go play DDR.

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.940
Are you looking into getting any of the upgrades possibly, like a fourth mix plus?

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.520
Eventually, maybe.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.380
If I can find a way to keep the Solo 2000 preserved, because I like it, it's a rare

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:47.220
enough machine that you're not going to find it everywhere on every street corner, so if

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.700
there's a way to preserve it and I get money, you know, providing I ever find a job, yeah

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.720
I probably will do something with it.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.900
You know how I was telling you a little earlier off the air before the show, Melody, they

01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:02.500
have a bootleg, or I don't know if it's bootleg or what, I think it's bootleg, a 5th mix upgrade

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.740
for a solo machine.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:09.620
I'm actually being given a link to a website here that shows you how to upgrade your DDR

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.300
5th mix to a solo.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.380
Wait a second, 5th to solo or solo to 5th?

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:20.760
Upgrade your DDR solo 2000, 4th mix or 4th mix plus machine to DDR solo 5th mix.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.760
So I never knew that you could do that.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.800
I thought that you couldn't do that.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.260
It must be some kind of interesting hack to it.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.880
So it's definitely not official.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.720
This site is not official looking at all that I'm looking at.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.600
And I'm not going to endorse it over the air, because they can pay me if they want that.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.960
It's not like the solos had hell anyway, considering it's been broken and it had to be sent to

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.080
KOJ to be fixed.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.480
So apparently it's about $1,000 if you want to upgrade that puppy.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480
That's kind of a lot.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.320
another solo for On the Cheap and I could do it that way, upgrade one that I don't care

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320
about.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.920
Back to the original thought, it's really easy to just hop out there and kind of play

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.240
whatever I want and amazingly I haven't had anyone really over to play it yet.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.880
I keep saying, yeah, you want to come over and play solo for free, but the schedule's

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.880
never really worked out.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.880
I'm coming next weekend.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880
Oh, so you want to come over?

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.540
Yes, I'm going to come play solo for free and maybe we can do something and tape something

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540
for the show, so I don't know.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540
Hey, that works.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.540
We'll see what we can do.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.220
You keep it outside? Yeah, actually you can keep a DDR machine outside as long as it's

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.260
undercover and you take good care of it. I've got the pad

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.580
I've got the pad and the bar because I have the one that actually has the bar

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.740
and the real pad, not that raised shit.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.980
But, yes, I have an actual bar on

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:37.820
the machine and it's an actual single pad. But as long as you just keep that covered up and keep the rest of it

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820
just careful, hey,

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.700
it's fine. It's survived a winner already outside. Plenty of people in the chat room are

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.380
saying, I'll come play, I'll come play!

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.380
Do I need to give out my DDR frames to DM me?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.380
Hey, money talks, you know?

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:53.380
Have you found ways to make money off the machine?

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.380
No, I'm the only one who plays it, so...

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.380
You don't take it out to make appearances to places?

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.380
Eventually that might be in the works.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:05.380
Not really that there are some ideas that are being kicked around with using it in conjunction with some other things.

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.380
That might eventually happen, might not.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.380
What's that place that the other one got kicked out of?

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.380
San Diego!

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.620
place it there, and make a little money off of that.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.500
I thought the idea was, I think this was actually an idea that came up on the show,

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.000
I think this is something Jamie suggested a few episodes back,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.920
that we get a truck, get your solo machine if you're willing, board it up on the

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.360
truck,

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.800
drive down to San Diego, and play at the parking lot all day long.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.140
See, that's one of the reasons why I'm glad my machine is not listed in machine

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.420
locations. When I saw that, I almost was ready to email that chick and be like,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.780
I dare you to take away my solo, bitch.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.580
they're saying in the chat room we should go on a California tour

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:45.260
Orange Lounge, we'll just put the machine in the back of a truck and get a go

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:49.500
that you know that might actually be I think we need to do we need to look into

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.420
something like this like when all the Christmas parades come up

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:58.180
we should enter like the orange lounge crew or something we get a DDR float

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.220
get some of us playing on the solo machine that would be awesome

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:04.780
and we'll have drinks with arrow shaped ice like I found

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.540
I found an ice cube tray that's arrows

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.420
we'd have the Shriner guys drive around in little carts right in front of us

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.940
behind us we'd have the high school cheerleaders going woo woo

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:20.060
you know and then right at D.D. Arnold's. If we have high school cheerleaders back there half the guys are going to be looking at that and not the arrows on the

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.260
screen you know this

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:27.020
get a U-Haul that's an idea. Get a U-Haul and have a mini tourney inside the truck I think you

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.740
might click yourselves it's kinda

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:33.020
asking for trouble or the machine. Don't let me drink it. Oh you want to say something

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.140
Joe? I don't know he was kinda doing this I wasn't sure if he was doing

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:39.140
Fight the power! Fight the power!

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:44.140
Those cheerleaders, they need to be dressed up like the nurse from I'm Alive.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.140
Should we get them giant syringes so they can ride up and down on them?

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:56.140
Oh! You know what, Melody, you and Irene, let's get you some syringes.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:17:00.140
We might be able to get Jamie a nice syringe to ride up and down on.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.140
Actually, I'll tell you what, Jamie, I'm sure would love to do her Emmy cosplay.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:09.140
cosplay she's got a great Emmy costume she could do are we dorks or what better

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.620
yet next year we could do the pride parade because everybody knows that DDR

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.340
is really gay so we you know that the thing about getting I'm kidding

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.460
backpedaling here a little bit but the thing about the ad that you haul and

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.740
playing a tournament you all that brings up an idea for a new type of attorney PA

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:30.980
thing PA while you're accelerating and decelerating and stuff from 50 to 60

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.340
miles an hour, then stomp on the brakes and try to not...

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:37.980
...backing up in here, roommates garage.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.900
Hey, inside joke.

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.580
PA on Bay Area highways.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.620
That would add an entire new element of difficulty to it.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.260
If you win, you get to stay on the truck.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:52.460
If you lose, out the window you go.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.900
Yeah, if you win, you survive.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.900
Roll, grandma, roll.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:59.300
Make sure you roll when you hit the ground, right?

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:05.300
I could insert a lame stop, drop, and roll joke here from the last tournament, but none of you were there, so I wouldn't get a laugh from this room.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.300
Oh, you were there, right? Yes.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.300
I would laugh. All right, there you go.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.300
Okay, then. Remember, stop, drop, roll.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.300
That was a classic Orange Lounge moment brought to you by...

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.300
Yes, Melody. Melody as well.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:28.140
Eventually, as far as I know, a Solo 2000 tournament might be a possibility, and hey,

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.180
I know a Solo 2000 that could be used for it, if people bribe me.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.820
Everyone drop me a PM.

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.980
Oh, should I spell the name?

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:44.060
They say that with throwing people off the truck thing, rate the bar for dear life, because

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.060
your Solo has a bar.

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.540
Hold on to the bar for dear life.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.540
Hey, I've got a bar on there.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:54.620
I'm already getting sponsorship offers here from various websites that want to promote

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:57.860
the DDR in a U-Haul tourney.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.620
Alright, hey, how about this?

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.540
Now speaking of raping the bar and stuff, we could put, okay, for our next PA tournament,

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.740
we could put a nice little hot wire attached to the bar so when someone goes to grab the

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.660
bar, they're met with a nice little jolt.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:14.660
Zap?

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.660
You know what?

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.660
That's not a bad idea.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:22.300
We should do that for the next Sacramento tournament, for a perfect attack, we can hook

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:27.140
up a little, you can do that with like a battery thing, hook it up to the bar, and just a little,

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.660
you know, if you touch the bar, you get a little zap.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:34.500
Yeah, bolt two, bolt two, motherfucker.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.500
You're a dork.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500
Oh, surprise!

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500
Surprise!

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.500
Hey, look at my shirt.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.500
I got this new shirt.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.500
I see your shirt.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:45.740
For the people in the radio land who can't see it, it's an 8-bit theater shirt, my wonderful

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.420
Irene got this from me, this is wonderful.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.220
Everybody at the store stares at me and goes, what a dork.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.100
But they did that anyway.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:58.740
The chat room is saying it would be like that pain station pong game, have you heard of

01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740
this?

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740
That pong game that you play?

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.900
And if you fuck up and the ball gets out of the zone, you get zapped.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.900
Your finger gets zapped.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.900
This is a real thing?

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900
It's the pain station.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900
Yes.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:08.900
It was some Dutch guy I think came up with it.

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.740
If you can give me a link to that article, I'd love to look at that.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.860
We came up with an idea of Timmy and me or something like that.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:18.100
It was a Beatmania with a foot at the bottom, and when you messed up, the foot would kick

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.380
you in the groin.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.380
Didn't we come up with that?

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:23.500
That was like our second episode or something.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.180
We said the DDR would have the vibrating foot.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:31.340
This is something I thought I'd go on.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.140
Any other thoughts on tournaments?

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.640
Machine ownage or I don't know.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.740
Machine ownage is cool.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.100
Do it.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.780
Everybody should buy their own machine.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.780
Yeah.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.780
To do it, press A.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.780
Oh, I've been given a link to the pain station.

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.780
But seriously, it is pretty cool to be able to just say,

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.780
I want to play DDR, I don't want to have to deal with anyone,

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.780
I don't want to have to deal with lines,

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.780
I'm going to go outside and play it.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.780
And honestly, if I could get it inside somehow I would,

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.780
but in my house that just doesn't really happen because I own too much crap.

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.780
Okay, the pain station is basically a game of Pong.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.780
The only difference is that if you lose,

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.500
the pain execution units will hurt you.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.180
Pain execution units?

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.100
There's a heat lamp which burns your hand,

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.340
an electrical circuit which shocks the hand,

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.300
and a whip which rapidly whips the same part of your hand

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.540
over and over very fast with a wire.

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:28.020
Says Volkar Marwau, co-creator of the Pain Station.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.060
I keep wanting to say PlayStation.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.740
And why did this become popular?

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.860
We can't help but wonder what the designers were going for

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.340
when they came up with this torture game machine.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:40.340
It's the PlayStation for Sato-Masticus all over again.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:45.340
Morale says, I was always interested in combining computers and the real world, and I wanted to create a computer game.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.340
We decided we would do a game with pain, and we picked Pong because it's easy to play.

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:55.340
The pain station brings in the body and makes you feel the media, so it's a new experience.

01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:04.340
They've tried it before with the biofeedback and rumble packs, so it's a logical progression to go from rumble pack to, you know, being whipped in your finger.

01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:07.340
Because there's more to video games than nice graphics.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.340
Can I make a comment?

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.340
Yes.

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:12.340
They already have this, it's called Chrono Cross.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.340
Hahahaha.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.340
Wah wah wah.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:22.340
Is that what happens when people on the street are calling you all about the player?

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.340
You know, you're the player who's putting in lashes and you have to like, walk to me.

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.340
Oh wait, Brad, this is for you.

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.340
There you go.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.340
Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night.

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:37.340
Take my wife please.

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.340
You're married?

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.340
Not anymore.

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:47.260
Oh, oh, Brad you got from SoCalCakes, you got a, oh no you didn't just diss Chrono Cross,

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.260
oh no you didn't.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.260
Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.260
Oh no you didn't.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:54.900
Let me explain, I don't need to feel like I have to, but Chrono Cross is a good game,

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.500
but you can't compare it to Chrono Trigger, just don't even try, I'm sorry.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.500
It's a good game.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.500
For me to poop on.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.500
There you go, thank you.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.060
I haven't played it enough to form an opinion.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:14.060
Radio light is common. There's usually about a 30 second delay between us and the chat room hearing it.

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:17.060
So, topic?

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.060
You want a new topic?

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.060
Should we?

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.060
There is a topic?

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.060
Topic?

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.060
Can we talk on the show?

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.060
Topic.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.060
Alright. Let's talk about...

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060
I can go over what's going on.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.060
Oh, I know what I want to talk about.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.060
Or we can do what you want to talk about.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.060
Well, what do you want to talk about?

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:35.060
You go ahead. We'll talk about your subject. We'll take a break. We'll come back and do what I want to talk about.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.060
Okay, well, brief, uh, Sim World update here.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.060
Alrighty.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:47.060
Okay, uh, Turning Mix still going on, um, for some reason the files are still down, so I have to wait for those to come back.

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:57.060
Um, NMR of, uh, Team Guilo is actually going to be posting, supposedly pretty soon, a, um, all the EuroMix 2 DWIs.

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:01.060
So that'd be pretty cool, we'll get to play the EuroMix 2 tracks, you know, over here.

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:08.060
And that's pretty much it. No new simulators out there. There's been a couple actual...

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:14.060
There's a new DWI FileMaker, but I haven't gotten to try that yet.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.060
That's about it. Pretty boring.

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.060
Okay, and Robby, would you want to talk about that?

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:21.060
Alright, great. Oh, yes. DarkTootoo, do you want to say something?

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:29.060
Yes, I just wanted to mention that I was working on some new result screen skins for Bomania DX, featuring the...

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:36.060
Well, I took the skins from 2DX style and created skins with them.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.060
Cool. Right on.

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:45.060
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and I'm going to start off with a little remix that was sent to me.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.060
This was something I was talking about earlier in the show.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.060
Twenn did this and it's called Let Them Paranoia and it's very scary.

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.060
Wait till you hear it. Here we go, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:54.060 --> 01:25:01.060
go.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:59.060
Let's not move on

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:04.060
Let's not move on

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:20.060
Let's not move on

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.060
Let's not move on, let's not move on

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:55.000
uh... big thanks to twin for that two minutes of hell

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
uh... back to some music we hope you like your own response radio

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:11.140
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does No, nobody does, yeah, baby

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:16.140
Ma yah, baby, yah, yah, yah, yah

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:21.140
Baby yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:26.140
Can't save me, can't save me

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:31.140
Bye bye baby balloon

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:36.140
Bye bye baby balloon

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:41.180
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:45.540
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 10.

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:48.420
They said we would never make it... your mic is on, right?

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:49.760
Yes, okay, thank you.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.040
You are listening to episode number 10.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:56.360
They said we would never get past episode number 2, and here we are into double digits.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:57.360
Episode number 10.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.500
I wish Jamie was here to celebrate in this moment as well, but I know she's off having

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.140
a great time, and so...

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.380
Still have her warp core breeze, we'll have our alcoholic vanilla coke.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.700
That's right.

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:12.380
So next week is going to be, we're calling it episode ten and a half.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.420
It's not really going to, because we're not here in this video, so it's going to be episode

01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:15.420
ten and a half.

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.980
But then in two weeks we'll come back to episode eleven.

01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:19.900
All new intro, all new, everything.

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.980
It's almost going to be like we're giving the whole show a face look.

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.620
Why are you going to have a new intro?

01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:25.680
Keep things fresh.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.680
Keep things lively.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680
New.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.680
You've only had ten shows.

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.140
Well, it's just, I want a new intro.

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.820
You know how many times I've ever heard that intro?

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:33.820
It's a completely selfish thing.

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.500
I've had to hear that intro too many times.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:36.740
Because I can make it better.

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:40.660
But it's a good, why fix it if it ain't broke?

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.660
But we're going to...

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.620
Because I'm a man, and I like to do that.

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.340
Our new intro is going to feature Polteri!

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.620
Yay!

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.940
Okay!

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:51.980
Anyway, oh okay.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:54.980
This was something I was thinking about a little bit earlier today.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.780
I know, I was thinking, imagine that.

01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:59.340
DDR on the Game Boy.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:00.340
Have you ever seen this?

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:07.340
What the fuck is the point? Can somebody explain to me what the fuck is the point of DDR on the Game Boy?

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:12.340
Those who can't afford to get the cool stuff, they have to go with the crappy stuff.

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:22.340
Okay, now wait. Come on, we play DDR like button-button revolution. There's not much difference. Oh, except for the, what is that, a 3-bit sound processor. I guess that is a kind of...

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:33.340
Well, it's for those people out there that are just hardcore DDR players that need smoking and having the patch on at the same time. You just can't get enough of it.

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:44.340
So, you're willing to settle for the little Game Boy version, too, when you're driving to the actual arcade or that kind of thing?

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:51.340
New tournament thing. Bring in your Game Boy DDR thing and play the song on the Game Boy and the arcade at the same time.

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:53.340
And we tie your score together.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.340
That's so cool!

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:55.340
The combination of the score.

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.340
No, it's not.

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:57.340
You're right, it's not.

01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.340
Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to make it sound exciting.

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:00.340
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.340
No, no.

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.340
I thought we could play some game here in the studio.

01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:06.340
Okay.

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:10.340
Because I don't know if you guys have ever heard the Game Boy renditions of your favorite DDR tunes.

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:13.740
tunes. I thought maybe we could play some of those tunes and see how long it's going

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:16.420
to take you guys to guess what the songs actually are.

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:18.980
Name that tune, DDR style?

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:24.180
It's name that tune, DDR Game Boy style. We're going to hear some of these. Anybody

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:28.060
can answer, so when you think you know, I'm going to set this mic down, and when you think

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:32.300
you know, grab the mic and say the answer, okay? I'm just going to set it down and don't

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.740
grab it until you know the answer, okay? Now, don't look on the computer screen at the name

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:39.820
because it does come up on the screen, but I'm going to trust you. We're using the on

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:46.220
your honor system okay kids you're on your honor okay there's a there's a jar

01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:50.260
full of mints for the retard society and it says on your honors that's what we're

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:59.820
doing here okay oh yes I'm gonna put it down

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:17.100
I'm going to start off with a really easy one, okay?

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.100
Something from Naoki.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.100
No.

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:20.100
Butterfly?

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.100
Yeah.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.540
Yeah, I rule, that's right, uh-huh.

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.180
I'm that geeky, woo!

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:34.180
i was going to get the but you know that

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.380
uh... yay

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.820
like the new song

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:53.820
all right

01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.740
it

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:05.740
and you are there we not

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:09.700

I've got the funk in my trousers for sure!

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:24.060
Next song please!

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.060
Whoo-hoo!

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:40.060
My Summer Love?

01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:45.060
It was like, I knew it, but I was like, shit, what is it?

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:50.060
I hope you all enjoyed the Mr. T rendition of My Summer Love.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.060
Is the mic on the ground?

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.060
Here we go.

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.060
Alright.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.060
Doobie Dub.

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.060
Doobie Dub.

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:07.060
You know what I mean, goddammit.

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:09.060
Alright.

01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.060
Sounds stupid.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:13.060
I can't think fast enough.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:20.060
Yeah, here we go, here we go.

01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.900
Dream a dream.

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:23.820
Yes.

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:30.260
See, the solo comes in good for something.

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:37.260
Fortunately, you get NOTHING!

01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.380
That's paranoia!

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:57.380
Oh, it's dropout!

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:15.900
AM3P!

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.460
How long is it?

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:20.100
Just think J-Dog sliding around.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.460
OK.

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.340
So that song, that beat?

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:27.140
Here we go, here's the next one.

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:27.660
Paranoia?

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.620
Yeah, there you go.

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.420
I'm not sure if you guessed that last time.

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.620
Two more, here we go.

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:35.460
These are harder ones.

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.940
I think this is harder.

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.940
I believe in miracles!

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:44.940
Oh, great quiz.

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:48.940
You gotta really know your mixes to get this one, so

01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:52.940
thanks to everything you got, okay? Here we go.

01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:56.940
Sky high?

01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:00.940
Yes.

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:04.940
Sky high?

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:08.940
Sky High?

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:16.940
You know what's sad is the AM3P remix is actually probably better than the 303 bass mix on the Konomics there.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:17.940
That's pretty bad.

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:24.940
That's all I got. What do you think was better, the AM3P remix on Konomics or the Game Boy version?

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:27.940
I can't tell.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.940
Guess what, they were the same.

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:34.940
And if you want to find those, they're actually, I believe, the Aaron in Japan site.

01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:37.940
Yes, those are ruthlessly stolen from Aaron in Japan's site.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.940
But they're actually labeled as, he's got, at aaroninjapan.com, he has this thing.

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:46.940
It's called DDR Man, which is like a hack for Mega Man 2, which is pretty cool.

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:47.940
And you can check that out.

01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.940
And he calls that the soundtrack.

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:50.940
Really?

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:52.940
Because those are all ripped from the Game Boy games.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.940
So, I don't think it says there that they're ripped from the Game Boy games.

01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.940
I'm not sure if he's aware that's where they came from.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:05.940
If you're looking to actually play the horrible Game Boy versions, you can find the ROMs on bemoningstyle.com, also they have the links there.

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:07.940
Now piracy is bad, young man.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:13.940
Only if you own the cartridge, and you have to delete it 24 hours after you, if you don't have it.

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.940
That's such crap.

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:23.940
I really need to go delete about 500-some ROMs that I've got on my computer right now, because it's been 24 hours.

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.940
And then one minute to the next minute you re-download them and then delete them in the next 24 hours.

01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:46.940
I know, I know, I know, I know, I just wiped my hard drive, I need to go start...

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:53.940
Hey, I also only have 56k, I'm sorry, we're not in the Bay Area where everybody's fiber-optic.

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.700
This is turning into a penis-sized competition.

01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:59.260
This is a guy from Florida says, I got 600 Game Boy ROMs.

01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:00.940
I got 600 Super Nintendo ROMs.

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.260
I got 1,400 NES ROMs.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.620
I got 400 Genesis ROMs.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.940
So, uh.

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:07.980
And you know what you can do with those?

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:08.860
I don't need to say.

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.860
You know what I'm saying.

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.060
Play them.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.660
You can play them over and over.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.300
That's right.

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.140
He's been too busy downloading the ROMs.

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:17.780
He's like, I don't have time for girls.

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:19.100
I don't have time for anything.

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:20.980
Give me my ROMs.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:21.480
Hey.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.140
Oh, I think he yelled that in a minute.

01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:23.820
What?

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.460
Why is SoCalCake saying I don't have a life?

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.140
Because he's mean.

01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.820
Yeah, it's just because I download stuff at work

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.820
instead of actually do work, you know,

01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:37.340
because I have a T1 line there doesn't mean anything.

01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.940
I'm just good at multitasking.

01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:46.940
You're not a slut, you're a time saver.

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.940
Let's see, what other topics do I want to talk about?

01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:51.260
Oh, I don't want to talk about tonight.

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.020
Matt, since you're kind of our unofficial, official co-host tonight, you've built your

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.320
own metal pads for DDR, correct?

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.980
Yes, that doesn't really help my argument that I have a life outside of DDR.

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.940
Well, so I'm great that we can go from that topic to this topic.

01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:08.540
Tell us about what a pain in the ass it is to build your own pads.

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:12.920
Oh, it's a very big pain in the ass, especially if you don't know how to solder like I do.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.060
So my pads actually are really, really, really ghetto.

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:21.980
They have, all their connections are actually all electrical tape.

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:23.260
It's really crap.

01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:29.020
But it works from now and then, it only comes apart if I throw it in the back of my car

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.540
and drive around with it.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.340
But they're pretty cool.

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:38.180
It's basically based off the DDR at home pads, and I believe there's a huge thread in DDR

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.300
Freak with directions on those.

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.020
I was about to say, where did you get the schematics on how to build your metal pads?

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:50.540
Well, a long time ago when the melting pot was online, we used to get them there, but

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:56.540
actually there's a huge link to about a 98 page thread that's on DDR Freak under the

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.540
DDR at Home.

01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.540
It's pinned to the top.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:03.900
You can find all the links there, and what I did a little bit differently than what they

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.100
had on there is instead of taking actual PlayStation controllers and wiring them to that, I ripped

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:14.580
I used to part my two old home pads at Softpads and wired them to that because they're a hell

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.660
lot easier to wire to because it's just a big, huge, flat metal thing you have to solder

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:24.380
to instead of drilling the hole in the controller and getting the solder on there perfectly.

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.380
I tried it the other way and it was really hard.

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:31.460
Then for the arrows, I just took the same pad and chopped up the arrows and put them

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.900
under plexiglass and it looked cool.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:38.180
What are some other home pads you'd recommend commercially out there on the market?

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:42.620
there's a lot of third-party pads and pads out there other than the official

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.020
Konami pads is there anything out there that you you'd endorse well I've played

01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.000
the because I was looking at software etc today and they have these mad cats

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.180
pads and they look so stupid like you so I don't know how well they play but they

01:45:55.180 --> 01:46:00.500
look awful they look like cheap 50s come on everybody let's square dance type pad

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:04.240
when it comes down the soft pads are pretty much all the same as far as the

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.960
insides go I mean really the only difference between the Konami official

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.820
soft pads and the third-party ones is they've got these like really thin

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:17.980
almost like tape like ribbon tape or something like that inside them they're

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:22.180
actual you know what the electricity goes through and you'll basically have a

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:25.820
thin piece of foam that's in there with holes in it and then when you step down

01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.840
on that piece of foam it makes a connection between the two layers of

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:33.740
like I won't call it tape. The difference between the third-party ones is the

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:37.740
third-party ones have almost like it looks like almost like a barcode going

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:43.180
across. They've got just small, thin layers going across, whereas the Konami official

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:48.420
ones have just the whole solid layer, so you probably get better connections with the Konami

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:54.020
official ones. Also, on the top of some of the Konami ones, they're textured differently,

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:55.340
which doesn't really do anything.

01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:59.460
Have you ever seen the Dreamcast ones that have that funny little layer over the top,

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.300
that like this weird kind of, it looks like tracing paper or something over the top of

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.420
the pad? It looks very odd. It's very cool, though. I don't know if you've ever seen them.

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.420
Very interesting stuff.

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:13.740
Now, taking a step up from the softpads, you've got the ignition pads, which I've played these

01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:19.820
at Fanime, you know, this year, and everyone says they're really cool. I hate the things.

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.300
I think they fucking suck.

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.980
Now, wait, I think we've got to, you're talking about the ignition pads?

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:24.980
Yes.

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.660
I think we've got to counter-argument here, because Glenn here, Lolo, who I haven't introduced

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.300
yet, he's in the studio, he actually has an ignition pad, and what do you think?

01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:38.900
I have one of the new ones, the Ignition 2.0s, and that's how I passed my first Cata. So,

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.860
I can pass Dynamite Raid at home on that.

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:46.480
Okay, well, you know, in my defense, I played Ignition 1, Pat, so.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480
Yeah.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.700
Obviously, they've probably gotten better. The problem I had with the last one is, even

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:53.980
though they did have raise buttons, which was nice, the problem was is they're raised

01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:59.340
so much. When you're playing on them, it just feels weird, and it actually, you know, really

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:04.540
hurt my ankles after just playing about one song. And they were pretty responsive, but

01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:08.180
it was just, it hurt the hell out of my ankles so I couldn't play anymore.

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:13.460
It's still not as good as the arcade, but I could pass a cata at home. I mean, that's

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:19.760
all I have to say. I could pass a cata at home. And you can't do that on a Konami official

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:23.780
pad without being halfway across the room when you're done, you know?

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.260
Okay. Then, let's see. Now, step up from those pads, you've also got the metal pads that

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:35.340
out there now. There's the Kevin K. pads, which Kevin K. has been really getting reamed

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:40.760
over because they suck. He has horrible wiring on them. Then there's also the new six panel

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.960
metal pads out there. They'll run about, I believe, 200 bucks a piece that you can actually

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.640
find online. There's tons of links in the DDR Freak at Home forum. They look alright.

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.080
I haven't gotten to play on any of them. But, you know, if you really want to go the same

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.400
route like I did and build one, it cost me about $200 a pad.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:04.440
That also includes that I had to buy the tools to do it because I didn't have a saw or drill

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.240
or anything like that, so I bought one of those.

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:13.240
So it really probably ended up being about $150 per pad.

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.040
You think it's a profitable business to be making your own metal pads and selling them

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.600
over eBay like some of these people are doing?

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.600
Nope.

01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:21.600
Not at all.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.600
After the cost of building them, which is roughly about $150 per pad,

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600
let's just say you're building the same one I had,

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:35.600
and then you have to charge a little bit more to get some profit off of it plus shipping,

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.600
you're only going to be making about $10 a pad and it's a good 40 hours worth of work.

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:47.600
It took me 40 hours to build two pads and I built them at the same time.

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.840
And plus having to maintain some sort of website or something like that so people can get hold

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.840
of you.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.600
Plus having to answer people's stupid things like, ah, it's not working anymore, and having

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.600
to replace it.

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600
It's just, it's not worth it.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:09.320
There's a guy that tried doing it a while back, Beat Gear, which were like $400 for

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.880
these pads and stuff.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.200
And I don't even know if anyone's actually gotten those yet.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.040
I think maybe a few people that have gotten them, but that was like almost a year ago

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.040
I think.

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.160
It's just taken forever, so I wouldn't recommend, you know, actually starting a business that

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.160
way.

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.120
Just make your own and be done with it.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.120
Seriously.

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:33.560
But the next thing I want to build is Dance Maniacs sensors, which would be beautiful.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.280
What would you play with, though?

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:36.520
There's no Dance Maniacs home version.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.520
What would you do?

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:44.520
There is a nice skin and all the step files for that old Delight Delight reduclication.

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:45.520
Oh, an emulator.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.520
An emulator.

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.520
Alright, cool.

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.520
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back and wrap up the

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520
show.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:55.960
So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio and as would be fitting, I'm going to play

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:56.960
a request.

01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.180
Somebody wanted to hear some more Orange Lounge, the artist.

01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:06.180
So here you go.

01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.180
Oh

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:03.180
Yeah, I'm just feeling love

01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:06.180
I need some new love

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.180
Ooh, yeah

01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.180
I need some new love

01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.180
No, no

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:13.180
I need some new love

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.180
Okay, okay

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:17.180
I need some new love

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.180
Ooh, yeah

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.180
Do you believe in love?

01:55:52.180 --> 01:56:17.900
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:29.900
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time at under sedationlive.org.

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:55.900
Orange Lounge! This GDR sucks! Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.900
Yes!

01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:57.900
GGPO!

01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:06.300
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're coming back to pretty much just about

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:12.540
wrap up the show here. Not a whole lot else to say. Well there was one quick thing I did

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:17.340
want to say. Oh yes, so it's Jamie's out of the state tonight. She's off in Nevada in

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.960
I thought, does anybody have any interesting playing DDR out of the state stories they

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:22.960
want to share?

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:23.960
Like not playing California?

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.860
Because California, if you ever looked at where all the machines are located throughout

01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:34.160
the nation, California is by far the biggest, you know, most well populated with DDR.

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:36.400
Any funny stories about playing DDR out of state?

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:39.320
Do you have anything, Melody or Matt?

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.320
Yes.

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:46.080
It's not particularly funny, but back when I was playing at, oh, trick level, I happened

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:51.020
to go to Reno and was playing on a USA for the simple fact that's all they had.

01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:55.180
The Nugget, I think it was, and I scared the hell out of the locals.

01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:59.220
I guess they thought they could only do basic, and here I come in and I have, like, La Señorita

01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:03.580
trick, and I nearly fall in love with the thing, and they're just like, oh my god, look

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.940
at her, and then I go to dub-by-dub advance, they're just like, oh my god, look what she's

01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:07.940
doing!

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:12.940
I'm just like, it's not that great, come on, people.

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.260
That's about the only experience I have.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:19.220
I'm waiting till I go back to the midwest to really scare the crap out of them right on and I hear there's some pretty

01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:22.780
Good arcades in the midwest though if you can find them. Yeah, if you can find them, uh

01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.660
You have anything to share Matt?

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:31.660
Well, my first game of DDR was in Lake Tahoe. My first game was in Vegas. Yeah, and

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:39.860
That was pretty bad. But anyways, um while back I went down actually it was during my birthday. I believe last year

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:41.660
I went to

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:48.220
Lake Tahoe and Reno to, um, you know, go gamble because I was 21, and, um, so, I went there

01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:53.700
and I got to play, um, a third Korean that was in Circus Circus, and that really sucked

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:57.800
because they had the stage pushed right up to the machine, so it was like, playing and

01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:59.700
hugging the, uh, screen at the same time.

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:00.700
I love DDR!

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.500
Seriously, it's, it's pretty bad, and I had a bunch of, like, drunk old people staring

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.580
at me, like, what the hell is he doing?

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:09.500
Why is he stepping on that machine?

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:10.500
What's he doing?

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:20.500
Well, I hope Jamie's having fun out there in Vegas and I'm sure Melody wishes that Mel B's having a good time too, yes?

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.500
Just not too good of a time.

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:30.500
Just not too good of a time, you know. As long as she's staying in the Vegas city limits and not going to any houses outside of town, everything's good.

01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.500
That's the end of the show folks.

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:40.500
And remember, any bribes for wanting to play Solo 2K can be PMed to SharksGirlSHARXGRRL.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:46.500
Nice little plug there. Good night, Melody. Anything else you want to add? Thank you for being our very special guest tonight. We appreciate it.

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.500
Thank you for paying attention to me. I've been lonely.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:54.500
Well, I'm glad you were a little more participating in the show because you didn't have a migraine or anything like that.

01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:58.500
It's amazing how much more lively and human you are when you're not in agonizing pain.

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:03.140
Well, I'm glad we get to see this side of Melody, and Dark Tetsuya, goodnight to you.

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.080
Any final parting words here?

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.220
Nah, word, sharks, girl, I know that.

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:10.220
Anything else you want to say?

02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:11.220
Goodbye to the folks out there.

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:12.220
All your fans out there.

02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:13.220
Yeah.

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.220
You got some fans in the chat room.

02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.220
Really?

02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:16.220
Yeah.

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.220
Sayonara.

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.220
Sayonara it is.

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.220
Bradley, anything?

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.220
Any final comments?

02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:21.220
Not really.

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:22.220
All right.

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:23.220
Brad and Irene are out in the...

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.220
Oh, bye.

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:27.660
Okay, Brad and Irene are out in the back getting cancer, so on behalf of them, I say goodnight,

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.440
And anything last from you, Matt? The co-host for this evening.

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:37.840
Yes, after today I'll have to revert back down to guest instead of co-host. I'd be willing

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.880
to step down, yes, as of next week.

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.440
You'll be willing to step down. Next week is going to be a special show. Definitely

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.180
tune in to next week's show. It's not going to be live, but it'll be pre-taped like a

02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:52.400
live show. It'll be interesting. Experimental show for you Labor Day people.

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:55.680
I'll make another painful edit to commemorate the show.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:58.640
Yeah, sounds fun.

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.840
On behalf of everybody else, thanks for listening, you guys.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.080
We'll see you next week.

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.800
And if you missed any part of the show,

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.920
we'll be doing a Monday night replay tomorrow night

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.080
from 7 PM until 1 o'clock in the morning.

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.800
A special three show rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.560
See you guys.

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:18.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.800
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.400
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:29.880
known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:33.640
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.120
I run with gays.

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.120
Oh, yeah?

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:39.120
I run with 12 gangs, and we only commit hate crimes.

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.120
Whatever, I'll do what I want.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.120
Whatever.

02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.120
You ain't bad.

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.120
You ain't nothing.

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.120
I ditch class and go shoot heroin in a school bathroom.

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:48.120
Whatever.

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.120
I ran for Congress and won.

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.120
Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hit her body.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.120
Whatever.

02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.120
I'll do what I want.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.120
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
