[SPEAKER_11]: Our live talk program begins now.

00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:29,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:49,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it 4215, pussy wave?

6
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:49,998
[SPEAKER_06]: You bitch!

00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:51,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let me check the zip code.

00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,020
[SPEAKER_06]: 212, fuck you!

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,501
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no morals, darling.

10
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:58,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.

11
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:01,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Kiss my great news.

12
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,367

13
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:07,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too!

15
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:08,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucker, yeah?

16
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,850
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm working on it.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:10,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Loser.

18
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:11,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame!

19
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the size of my face.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

21
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:25,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

22
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I am your singing telegram.

23
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

24
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,542
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

26
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

00:01:55,251 --> 00:02:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: We are joined in studio once again by a whole buffet of guests, including two special out-of-towners tonight.

29
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:02,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello, everybody, to Jazz.

30
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:03,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

31
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR Mike.

32
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you fucking assholes.

33
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, he's exercising his internet radio rights there.

34
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:18,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, we're always joined by a bunch of our usual in-studio friends.

35
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:19,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Matt.

36
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:19,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt.

37
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, and in the corner, Bradley.

38
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be loud for once.

39
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:27,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Get picked up there.

40
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:36,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break and playing some requests that we've had the past few weeks.

41
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other opening thoughts from Miss Sakura?

42
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:44,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a specific thought.

43
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:46,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll get to why in a little bit later.

44
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But first up, a pretty quick break.

45
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:22,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

46
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:24,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

47
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

48
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:36,703
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

49
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

50
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:43,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Mel B of R... Hi, this is...

[SPEAKER_06]: Paying the cards, those things don't mean a thing Words for your brain, pain is my game Why let the rain flow with those frames?

58
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:13,764
[SPEAKER_06]: A pump from the beach, no such thing as pain Do the jump!

[SPEAKER_06]: Where's yours, can I please wait?

74
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,587
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it just to get it and just take a picture?

[SPEAKER_06]: I carry a camera for all my adventures You carry a camera for all your adventures That was good!

[SPEAKER_12]: The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball

79
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

80
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,619
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Swedish chef there promoting our little show.

81
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Swedish chef can also be found on Google.

82
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And we apologize for the feedback we're getting here tonight.

83
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's because we're crammed in a little room and we've got a fan right near us.

84
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we want to move the fan.

85
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,385
[SPEAKER_03]: We might get a little less interference with what's going on.

86
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

87
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:02,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll work on that.

88
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So please pardon the hum in the background.

89
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:08,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It adds character.

90
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

91
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:19,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so in that last segment we had, what, Papaya with Supergirl, and I tried to play Mr. T, Take Me Higher, but unfortunately the damn MP3 was corrupt.

92
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So we threw in some Sister Mosesha from Parappa the Rapper Part 2.

93
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:24,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

94
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:25,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fun stage.

95
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

96
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you wanted to give that as a shout-out to some people?

97
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:37,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there's some people who said they'd be listening tonight, so I'd like to say hi to Mary, to Ash, Michelle, and Phil.

98
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:39,182
[SPEAKER_14]: So hi, people.

99
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have a shoutout they'd like to give out while we're here?

100
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:44,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Shoutout!

101
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so like, I hope all you conquered scrubs are listening to this, because... No!

102
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I even talking?

103
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:54,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can hear you.

104
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:55,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, crap.

105
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, gotta go, bye.

106
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:00,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this thing on?

107
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is on.

108
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Testies, test, oh wait.

109
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we are joined in studio tonight by some special out of town guests.

110
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,079
[SPEAKER_03]: What brings you guys here to town this weekend?

111
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,602
[SPEAKER_11]: We were bored.

112
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:20,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, if we sound a little bit out of it tonight and very unprepared for tonight's show, there is good reason for that.

113
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:22,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I like scotch.

114
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I like double shots of scotch very much.

115
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,366
[SPEAKER_03]: If you count getting completely shit-faced as a little, then yeah.

116
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:45,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and keep talking, Jamie.

117
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:46,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to filter some things out here.

118
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:47,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this pressure!

119
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:48,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't take it!

120
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't make me talk!

121
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi!

122
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:51,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi!

123
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, the party last night was pretty, well, kind of insane.

124
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:10,020
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a lot of people here, and it was basically, there was 2DX going on in the game room, and I wandered in there one time with Guitar Freaks going on,

125
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:22,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there was also, you know, more drinking and quiche.

126
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to say that in the microphone so everybody can hear you.

127
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever you want.

128
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:30,482
[SPEAKER_14]: We're on the air.

129
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Say whatever you want.

130
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's listening?

131
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:32,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody.

132
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:33,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's everybody?

133
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, people.

134
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:36,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

135
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:42,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay.

136
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:44,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously not a mic person.

137
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, wait.

138
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:45,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Try again.

139
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:46,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Try again.

140
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:47,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, mic.

141
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, okay.

142
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:50,769
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking.

143
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:51,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking.

144
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:52,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so anyway.

145
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.

146
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

147
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:55,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody say hi.

148
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:58,416
[SPEAKER_04]: The party was fun.

149
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I had lots of people walking around the assembly room drunk.

150
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,223
[SPEAKER_04]: People kept locking me out in the garage with my sim all night long.

151
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:06,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

152
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:08,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was fun.

153
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I hung out with you and I was drunk.

154
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:20,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to do Drunk Drunk Revolution and I really wish that Wendell had been there because I owe him a match of Drunk Drunk Revolution back from Faname last year.

155
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll just have to invite him the next time.

156
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:23,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.

157
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we have a special message from the chat room for Mike from SoCalKicks.

158
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, fuck you.

159
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:31,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

160
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

161
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:36,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Special delivery there from our chat room.

162
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:41,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to join in our chat room and join in the ever-interesting festivities tonight... Plug alert.

163
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:41,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Plug alert.

164
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight will be an interesting show, I guarantee, because we're all kind of hungover.

165
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,022
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not hungover.

166
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'd never get hungover.

167
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not technically hungover.

168
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:50,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... I'm emotionally hungover.

169
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:52,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

170
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:54,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway... We don't have sad music, though.

171
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:55,148
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

172
00:15:55,168 --> 00:16:01,233
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the saddest thing in DDR I can think of to play is, like... Raid of Sorrow or Eversnow.

173
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:02,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Or...

174
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:06,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I could play like, how about ballad for you?

175
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:13,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Do not ever play, there is one of the other songs that will never show up on our playlist.

176
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:14,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Never.

177
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:16,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

178
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,071
[SPEAKER_14]: That was punctuated with a lovely noise.

179
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:21,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Burp.

180
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,512
[SPEAKER_14]: They're saying about the party saying Sky was stripped of his virginity.

181
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:34,025
[SPEAKER_03]: About four years ago, bub.

182
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Not last night.

183
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:37,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't we normally pass that on the way to the Bay Area?

184
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

185
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,077
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Bimani-related show.

186
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:43,840
[SPEAKER_03]: A B-Mani show.

187
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:47,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about Konami's famous B-Mani series.

188
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:50,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Be money right on this show

189
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:26,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about this outfit here.

190
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:37,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, I was playing Speed Demon, and for any of you who don't know what that game is, it's the most ridiculously easy way to win free tickets.

191
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,705
[SPEAKER_17]: So I played it, and I spent about $2, won 500 tickets.

192
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,405
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, so, me and my friend

193
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:44,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, ooh, it's a hat thing.

194
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,451
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it opened up into this big kind of lampshade.

195
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,732
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like a wicker lampshade.

196
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:53,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, except that it's not completely round.

197
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,975
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like a Tiffany lamp, but without the knee glass.

198
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and it's not that great, but anyway, it's kind of cool.

199
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,038
[SPEAKER_17]: And for 150 tickets, I bought two.

200
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,299
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had 200 tickets left.

201
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,281
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I saw the fans, which are made of crap.

202
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,462
[SPEAKER_17]: The pretty little birds.

203
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Craps with colors on them.

204
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,823
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I took hate of them.

205
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:15,324
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they gave me two extra, because they're nice.

206
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:16,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a harmonica.

207
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:22,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, now I put it on, and I walk around and make a fool of myself.

208
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you did that anyway.

209
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:26,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, but now I can stay cool while doing it.

210
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:27,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, see.

211
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:28,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally.

212
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:32,658
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I call an intelligent, ridiculous-looking fashion sense.

213
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had the webcam stuff working, but I don't.

214
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still working on that.

215
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hopefully have that up soon.

216
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I said that two weeks ago, so who knows.

217
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:42,663
[SPEAKER_14]: That's soon in Rob's universe, by the way.

218
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

219
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:53,868
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to join our chat room, visit any other side IRC server, like irc.egheads.org, and join Channel Orange Lounge.

220
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,945
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can talk to us and participate live with the show.

221
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:01,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, that's Orange Lounge, not red or purple.

222
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the band from 2DX where we stole the name, basically.

223
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:09,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's talk to our guests.

224
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to our guests here.

225
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have anything that you're here to plug tonight?

226
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:20,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Because usually when guests come on shows, they're here to plug something like their latest album or a TV show or a movie they're going to be in.

227
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:26,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have anything, tournaments or special appearances you're going to be making or websites or what?

228
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

229
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,122
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just here for the fuck of it, huh?

230
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:31,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

231
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:31,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

232
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,689
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just here to say, I was on Orange Lounge.

233
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:35,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I destroyed Orange Lounge.

234
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Bingo!

235
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,635
[SPEAKER_02]: He's here to watch anime porn with all of us.

236
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:40,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

237
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,799
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the coolest line?

238
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'll ask.

239
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my baby!

240
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not inside of me.

241
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:48,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be pregnant.

242
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my baby.

243
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the other one that we saw?

244
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that one part where he's fantasizing about the chick.

245
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, and then he sees the guy sucking his dick.

246
00:19:59,644 --> 00:19:59,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

247
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Hence the warning for adult content.

248
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry about that.

249
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,111
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Chaz?

250
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to promote?

251
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:11,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Step Squad.

252
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:13,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

253
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Ghost Step Squad.

254
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:14,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

255
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Go Dave Squad!

256
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:22,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Team Sack making an appearance at Cesar.

257
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I grab the mic?

258
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you were an attention whore.

259
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,811
[SPEAKER_17]: I grab the mic all the time.

260
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:33,772
[SPEAKER_17]: He's right next to me.

261
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:34,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Rob's mic.

262
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:35,893
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a big grab.

263
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I can already tell where this show is going.

264
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:45,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe I ought to take the suggestion and just end the show when the Simpsons come on and we'll just fuck the show, let's watch the Simpsons.

265
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,500
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

266
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,560
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

267
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:46,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on the radio.

268
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,469
[SPEAKER_04]: New mirrors for that.

269
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,194
[SPEAKER_04]: DWI, I guess version 2.0 beta 5 is finally out now.

270
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:20,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, because I did play with the sim last night, I have 976 songs in there now.

271
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,084
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is you can't configure any of the keyboard or joystick options in there.

272
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:30,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically I was stuck without being able to use my pads on it, which really disappointed me.

273
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And the movies still don't work on it.

274
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:46,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Step Mania 5 is supposed to be out pretty soon, or at least Beta 5 for that, so hopefully soon, because it said on DDR Mania X that it was already out, but I haven't seen it, and still waiting for that.

275
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:59,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, Tourney Mix 2 is still on for August, so entering that, you'll see all the new songs come up around August 15th on DDR East Coast Invasion, so watch for that, I guess.

276
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we still have time to enter that?

277
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes we do.

278
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Well this time around I will be entering.

279
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already picked which song I'm going to be doing, which will be Outer Limits.

280
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:16,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for that to be coming probably on August 15th.

281
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Rad.

282
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:23,235
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to make a shout out to Ash who just entered the room.

283
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:26,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad that you made it into the chat room.

284
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:26,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy IRC.

285
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:26,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

286
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:35,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one errand that you guys are running today, kind of speaking about the PC simulations, you guys are running over to Fry's to pick up a copy of Dance Dance Revolution for the PC.

287
00:22:37,717 --> 00:22:38,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did.

288
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:41,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and you haven't even gotten to try it out yet.

289
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I made a copy for myself and then didn't quite get a chance to.

290
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play it on one of the breaks and I'll be back with my brief review of it.

291
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:54,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so during one of the breaks you can go run out there and install it and give us a review.

292
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:55,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's already installed.

293
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:56,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I just gotta go play it.

294
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:56,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

295
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:57,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that during one of the breaks.

296
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll talk a little bit more about DDR for the PC later.

297
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,767
[SPEAKER_03]: What else in news going on in the Bomani world?

298
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:06,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.

299
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,092
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were at that tournament that just happened over the weekend.

300
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not over the weekend.

301
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:11,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It was during the week.

302
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: The Triple Threat.

303
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think about that?

304
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:15,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you weren't there, Justin?

305
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:16,619
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just Mike.

306
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:19,202
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of the Triple Threat contest?

307
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:20,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a little summary.

308
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, for one thing, Mike Nose should know that he should never have a tournament on Thursday and Friday.

309
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:35,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But he already knows that from the bitching that people have done, including Slip and Meow and all the other fucking flamers out there.

310
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to go to that, and I couldn't because it was on the weekday.

311
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:39,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

312
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:40,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, I had to work.

313
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:42,871
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm just echoing everything everybody else says.

314
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to work, I wanted to go.

315
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:46,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but anyway, it was a good tournament.

316
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really new, something different.

317
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:51,035
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three events.

318
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the Survivor Series, which had teams competing against other teams.

319
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,220
[SPEAKER_02]: A March Madness wannabe thing going on.

320
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:18,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had the DDE Royal Rumble, which was pretty cool, but some of the things I didn't want to see, like Zero stripping in front of an Emphasis, or Mr. Windle almost eating Emphasis too, which was not a good thing to see.

321
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel sorry for Emphasis.

322
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as we all do.

323
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee.

324
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, um...

325
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:35,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, Cory, he was bitching again because he lost.

326
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:41,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he has to get over it and deal with his loss, just like every other PA.

327
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Who won?

328
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:43,870
[SPEAKER_02]: For Royal Rumble...

329
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:45,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigger Eugene

330
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: His brother, Ree, I believe.

331
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:02,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

332
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he just lasted after that all the way up to the 28th person.

333
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:08,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

334
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:13,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Emphasis, he got to come back again because he had tokens.

335
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:19,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every time you beat three people or so many people, you gain an extra so-called life.

336
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:20,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make a comeback.

337
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:27,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jimmy lost to him on Kakume, which sucked because he'd always practice that song a lot.

338
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:43,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, March Madness, surprisingly, re-won, beating Eugene by two grades on, um, Waka Laka, Hidden Right on flat, I believe, which is pretty good.

339
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:43,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Scary.

340
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:44,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, very scary.

341
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Survivor Series...

342
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked too much shit, I thought my team was gonna win, we got knocked out first round.

343
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,413
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, yeah, it was really close.

344
00:25:56,613 --> 00:26:01,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I took out Ree, which is a good compliment to accomplish, because he always beats me at tournaments.

345
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:01,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes!

346
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:02,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all!

347
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:03,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all!

348
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:09,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah, um, a lot of people came, it was a good tournament.

349
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope to look forward to another one like that, just make sure it's on a weekend.

350
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as you all know, on the 17th...

351
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:22,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sounds Tournament is going to be at Mountain Mike's in Concord.

352
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully all of you will come to that.

353
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be pretty fun.

354
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:36,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the fourth bracket, this wasted two minutes of my life and I want it back.

355
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

356
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,089
[SPEAKER_03]: For freestyle.

357
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:38,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.

358
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That would so be my category if I ever actually entered freestyle.

359
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:45,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get a chance to see my drunken freestyle last night?

360
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:50,735
[SPEAKER_03]: On Loki's sim I was dancing, he has Speedway in his sim with steps to it.

361
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:54,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it, however I think that might be an excuse to revive the bats.

362
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we ought to do?

363
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:02,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to this tournament and just get fucking wasted and do a freestyle routine and see how we do.

364
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:06,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Which for me, if I'm going to freestyle, is it going to be with bats or pom-poms?

365
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:07,208
[SPEAKER_03]: We're of age.

366
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:08,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's acceptable.

367
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:09,650
[SPEAKER_03]: If other people drive us, it's cool.

368
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,452
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to order a pitcher of beer at Mountain Mike's.

369
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:19,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know if it would be against the rules if we could, you know, do the freestyle with the pitcher of beer.

370
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to spill my beer.

371
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:22,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

372
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,873
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, that's alcohol abuse.

373
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:26,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Second of all, that's a, you know, dance pad that we can't, like, get wet.

374
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:31,299
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, at least from non-organic, well, I guess it is organic.

375
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's bad enough we might get so drunk to the point of, like, accidentally urinating on the pads.

376
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:36,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

377
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:37,604
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

378
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:40,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I may throw up, but I never pee on the pad.

379
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:43,388
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

380
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:44,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, shut up!

381
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:48,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just thinking of the sound clips I'm going to get from this show.

382
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:49,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You are not using that.

383
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:50,804
[SPEAKER_14]: You are not.

384
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I never pee on the dance pad.

385
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:54,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

386
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:57,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

387
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, other news.

388
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about... Yes, other news.

389
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:02,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Other news.

390
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's change the direction of this show.

391
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:06,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not.

392
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:10,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about 8th style.

393
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:10,794
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX 8th style.

394
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,274
[SPEAKER_03]: 8th style.

395
00:28:11,434 --> 00:28:11,834
[SPEAKER_03]: 8th style.

396
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:18,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some demo MP3s from 8thStyle, because it's on test location right now.

397
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to play some clips from some of the new songs.

398
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:25,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Now has anybody else here heard these 8thStyle songs?

399
00:28:25,508 --> 00:28:25,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard them?

400
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:28,130
[SPEAKER_03]: No, assuming you haven't.

401
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what you guys think of them.

402
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play some quick clips.

403
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:35,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to play the whole thing because they're kind of long, so we'll just kind of skip to the middle and see what we get.

404
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:38,856
[SPEAKER_03]: This first song I'm going to play is Airflow by Mr. T.

405
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:51,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused now.

406
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was Mr. T and Motokai F or whatever.

407
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:55,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, I could be wrong.

408
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:20,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Blue Impulse Yuki

409
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:47,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very decent.

410
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray, I'm happy he finally ditched Politary.

411
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:55,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's probably just their pet name.

412
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:58,297
[SPEAKER_04]: If Brad was here, he would smack you right now.

413
00:29:58,437 --> 00:29:59,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, he's not.

414
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:01,419
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his own damn fault for not showing up.

415
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Politary!

416
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Brad!

417
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:04,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

418
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Right in the nose!

419
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he's not listening at home.

420
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:12,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll be in trouble if that was.

421
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at...

422
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:17,056
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Taka doing Rainbow Flyer.

423
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:29,824
Yeah, it sounds like I sense a lot of those little like triplet things that you see a lot in 2DX.

424
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,606
It's like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

425
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:49,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to remember, yeah, these MP3s are going to be crappy because people are recording them off the machine, literally.

426
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't the machines, though, have audio in and out?

427
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:52,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Why can't they just use that?

428
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:59,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because the people who own the arcade are testing the machine, might be kind of watching with an evil eye.

429
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you have Konami representatives around the bit like, uh, what are you doing?

430
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, give it time, because that's what they did with Max 2 and that kind of thing.

431
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:10,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just give it time.

432
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody will leak the soundtrack eventually.

433
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last one here, now this falls into a category called Cuddlecore.

434
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:18,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me!

435
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:18,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Mhm.

436
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:45,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds kind of mellow.

437
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:48,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, you can hear all the conversation.

438
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it get interesting by the end?

439
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,715
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of sounds like a carnival song.

440
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge

441
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:32,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying in the chat room, I farted better quality sounds than this in response to the Cuddle Corps song.

442
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from Pyro Man.

443
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be an interesting 2DX song, kind of like in the Kitty.

444
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:42,117
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the Kitty song?

445
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:42,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

446
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:43,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Theme of Oopa.

447
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:43,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's...

448
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, that song was very interesting.

449
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:57,836
[SPEAKER_14]: It made it onto Beatmania Pocket for Wonderswan.

450
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:02,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And that actually is a really good version of Beatmania.

451
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:12,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you have to have it with you and you have a Wonderswan, it came with a little scratch pad that hooks over to the right side of the system.

452
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:15,726
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of the music, it only had ten songs in it, but they were all digitized.

453
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:19,809
[SPEAKER_14]: So you didn't get, you know, crappy MIDI like with the DDRGB series.

454
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, also still popular in the 2DX world, Sixth Style for the home.

455
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Still pretty much new, and lots of people getting that, and more and more people playing it.

456
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:40,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the Game Boy versions of the Bumani games, you can actually get those at BumaniStyle.com.

457
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey!

458
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,241
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got them there.

459
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:44,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Free plug!

460
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, free plug.

461
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:47,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can do what I did and go buy them.

462
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,181
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the right way and the wrong way.

463
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's like so 2000.

464
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:56,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

465
00:33:56,607 --> 00:34:00,071
[SPEAKER_14]: I have it on my Game Boy, and I can take it with me, whereas I can't take my whole computer with me.

466
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:02,955
[SPEAKER_14]: My bio is a little heavy, thank you.

467
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And it won't fit into my purse!

468
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:13,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to go to a quick break here and we're going to test out DDRPC.

469
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are running out to go play that because we just got it here, a copy of it in the house.

470
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:28,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to take a quick break and we'll come back with our initial thoughts on DDRPC, some interesting news involving DDRPC that could be an indication of where U.S.

471
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani is headed.

472
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:33,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And also tonight we've got FU of the Week, pretty lengthy this week.

473
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:33,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,299
[SPEAKER_03]: We also are doing another additional list list tonight, so stay tuned for that.

475
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:40,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.

476
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,154
Thanks for watching!

477
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:27,504
Let it rain, let it fly.

478
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch, get a new song!

479
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,718
[SPEAKER_11]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

480
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:41,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was like the very first promo that I ever made for the station.

481
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

482
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember coming up with that in your car.

483
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:45,521
[SPEAKER_14]: You did.

484
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The one-hit wonder one?

485
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,443
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not the one-hit wonder one.

486
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:50,583
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about the Jogle one.

487
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:51,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Jogle one?

488
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:55,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we were listening to one of your Dance Mania compilations.

489
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:55,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

490
00:40:56,566 --> 00:41:00,687
[SPEAKER_14]: And we started... It was playing Bye Bye Baby.

491
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:02,068
[SPEAKER_18]: That wasn't nice, Drew.

492
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: But she needs a new song.

493
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:06,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's face it.

494
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're all the same.

495
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,873
[SPEAKER_14]: The song was playing and I was in the back seat singing Damdaryam.

496
00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like how Matt, who's out in the garage right now with DDRPC, playing, he has an edit for Bye Bye Baby Balloon that's basically just the steps to Damdaryam.

497
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works for like the first half of the song, but then it kind of gets out of sync.

498
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's an extra beat or something that throws it all off.

499
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But it works scary well.

500
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:34,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, they're out in the garage right now playing DDRPC.

501
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:36,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure they're not watching the anime porn again?

502
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:38,597
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be by this point as soon as I left.

503
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:43,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I went out there, they were watching the DDRPC.

504
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:48,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Whole new interface, which I've got to say is weird.

505
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of like 4th Mix.

506
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:52,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But not.

507
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,480
[SPEAKER_03]: But not.

508
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,260
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I explain this?

509
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if on 4th Mix you could go...

510
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:01,754
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.

511
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one thing I noticed right away, the characters are based off some kind of new engine because they're really high resolution, they look really good, the characters.

512
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:34,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is probably why the new hidden characters are such a big deal.

513
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:43,638
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big news that came up this week is that they've released the very first downloadable characters for DDRPC.

514
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:46,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Zack and Alex are the names.

515
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:50,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not based off any other previous DDR characters.

516
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,101
[SPEAKER_03]: They're brand spanking new.

517
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:53,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay for America.

518
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:55,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, we get something special.

519
00:42:55,763 --> 00:43:00,025
[SPEAKER_03]: We get an Earthlight mix and an AMT3P mix and now we get...

520
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:03,070
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes me spell a patriotic rhyme.

521
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm feeling it in the cockles of my heart.

522
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:14,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically the game is mostly based off a fourth mix engine, although it is a little smoother.

523
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:18,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it's a lot, the arrows seem to run a little smoother, kind of like fifth mix smooth.

524
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:20,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to look, and they turned it off.

525
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they turned it off?

526
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:21,854
[SPEAKER_03]: How mean of them.

527
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:23,815
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get to see the interface thing?

528
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:34,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, well, I mean, again, since it's based off of 4th Mixed Engine, it looks very similar, except you kind of could just pick any category you want, and then the songs are in a circle, as opposed to across the bottom.

529
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:35,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting.

530
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,899
[SPEAKER_18]: It's circly, huh?

531
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:37,920
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, circles are good.

532
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Circles are round.

533
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm also, I'm also being told not to forget Angel Zuken, as opposed to Devil Zuken.

534
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you got Angel.

535
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Why can't we have, you know, Purgatorial Zuken or something?

536
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:53,711
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, where it's just, you know, kind of boring and just stands there.

537
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Japs got Zuken, I mean.

538
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:05,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, since there's like two players, can't they like bend down and shit on their face and everything?

539
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And yell out in- I'M CHINESE, OH!

540
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:15,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our clip for the movie.

541
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,109
[SPEAKER_03]: How about topless?

542
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:17,530
[SPEAKER_03]: How about topless?

543
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,571
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have, like, boyzookin.

544
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:21,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you anything.

545
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:23,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do you think it's... But would they bounce?

546
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

547
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:28,814
[SPEAKER_03]: In the chatroom, they're hoping for a shirtless Emmy.

548
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:29,894
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

549
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I get pamphlet rage.

550
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:38,877
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do you think it's going to take?

551
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think he's going to bounce?

552
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody...

553
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:45,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus, bro.

554
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:59,711
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody went and hacked Tomb Raider so that you could play a nude Lara Croft with big old jugs and, you know, how long is it going to take before somebody hacks DDRPC so you can play Topless Zukin, Shirtless Enemy, Pantsless Rage?

555
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:04,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So what, then merge the first dead or alive with DDR and have, like, Bounce Bounce Revolution?

556
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:07,735
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Bounce with B-Bounce Revolution.

557
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:13,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Since now you can play DDR at home in the nude, play along with our characters in the nude!

558
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:18,055
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I bet they're gonna have skins you can make for that, though.

559
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:18,936
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

560
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:20,518
[SPEAKER_03]: New skins.

561
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, baby.

562
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:26,785
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's gonna turn into this whole big, you know, fad like what happened with The Sims.

563
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:33,483
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, where you can have, you know, Wolverine and, um, who else, somebody random.

564
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:38,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I don't know, Galacticus, you know, hanging out, doing husband-wifey things.

565
00:45:43,008 --> 00:45:52,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the return of... A very observant fellow in the chatroom says, now I can't confirm this, maybe Jamie can, but you can see Rage's ball line in third mix.

566
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:58,031
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I never bothered to check, but maybe I will.

567
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:59,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Pyromancer then.

568
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:00,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a moron.

569
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:04,117
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have nuts in DDR.

570
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just not talk about people to play.

571
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:09,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's back joining us.

572
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:12,885
[SPEAKER_03]: What were your first impressions of DDR PC being a sim fan?

573
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:15,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's start with the interface.

574
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:17,026
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell were they thinking?

575
00:46:17,947 --> 00:46:21,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 4th Mix, but... It's the most retarded interface I've ever seen.

576
00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:28,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but I'll give it a little credit, because 4th Mix needed that, where you can go back and forth between the categories.

577
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:29,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It just...

578
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:31,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks kinda dumb.

579
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but the idea's good, it just looks dumb.

580
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:50,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you took the banners from 4th Mix and stuck it on the little CD rotation thing that they have in all music mode, you would get what you have there, which looks like a bunch of banners hanging from a spindle thing, like some sort of like sunglass case type thing that you would see in a store.

581
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:55,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most fucking retarded thing, and they only have like 8 songs in each thing, so even if it was like 4th Mix...

582
00:46:56,061 --> 00:47:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Which you gotta admit has about like at least 20 or so in each category I mean, why the hell are they doing that with the interface?

583
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:20,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks like crap So that's fine, you know, it looks like crap The textures as far as the characters go, really good, looks nice Yeah, the characters look nice, that's the first thing I said too Backgrounds, who really cares, no one watches the backgrounds But they look nice too Did you see any Lego people yet?

584
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best background with Lego people.

585
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:24,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I didn't.

586
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:30,572
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I did like, though, is the fact that you can customize with buttons and stuff for the controllers and that kind of thing.

587
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:33,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the way I have my pads wired, they're really fucked up.

588
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:38,394
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it was set to how a pad was, it wouldn't work.

589
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad they have that, at least.

590
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:46,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, we have Michael here with a yo-yo stuck in his eye.

591
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:48,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Hyroman sent me a picture.

592
00:47:48,886 --> 00:47:50,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Shall we take a vote on whether to open it or not?

593
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:52,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It is entitled Rage.gif.

594
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can bet you know what it is.

595
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:55,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Bald!

596
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:56,432
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

597
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:58,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all vote yes, we're going to open it.

598
00:47:58,414 --> 00:48:01,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to do with these files sent to me during the show.

599
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:03,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we're just going to vote if we're going to waste our time with it or not.

600
00:48:03,998 --> 00:48:05,680
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we voted to waste our time with it.

601
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

602
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:10,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a picture of Rage.

603
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is that supposed to be that the shadowing there is supposed to be like balls?

604
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless he's got some really huge testicles.

605
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:21,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

606
00:48:23,204 --> 00:48:24,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what Breach Pat likes.

607
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that supposed to be the peenie right there?

608
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:30,070
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, that's not impressive.

609
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I expected better from Rache.

610
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:38,357
[SPEAKER_14]: But keep in mind, you know, Rache goes everywhere.

611
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:40,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe that's why he's called Rache.

612
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,862
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very angry over the fact he has a small penis.

613
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:45,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never thought about that.

614
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray, this show's resorted to dick jokes.

615
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:49,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

616
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:56,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, no, it's like that one joke where it goes into get laid at a brothel.

617
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:57,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait, wait.

618
00:48:57,959 --> 00:48:58,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you know what?

619
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

620
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's doctored.

621
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:02,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

622
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:03,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that?

623
00:49:04,664 --> 00:49:05,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very scary.

624
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:06,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, though.

625
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not, because the shadowing looks right.

626
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:10,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it's a real thing.

627
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,791
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Robbie, you kind of look like a woman there.

628
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a woman.

629
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:14,252
It's a woman.

630
00:49:14,272 --> 00:49:15,353
It's a woman.

631
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:19,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So Rage has a vagina.

632
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:21,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Chicks with dicks.

633
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:28,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically the Baxteran rage could make it in the porn industry because of one small defect.

634
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:32,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's turned to DDR to fan out his frustrations.

635
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:35,125
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's like the joke of the man who went into the brothel.

636
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:43,110
[SPEAKER_14]: He goes in and this one woman comes running out of the room laughing hysterically, says his dick's had tiny on it.

637
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And so another one goes in and she comes running out screaming, I can't do it, his dick says tiny on it.

638
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:52,312
[SPEAKER_14]: So another one goes in, and she actually has a little bit more patience.

639
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:55,359
[SPEAKER_14]: She comes out hours later, and...

640
00:49:56,224 --> 00:49:57,665
[SPEAKER_14]: The other goes, so you could do it?

641
00:49:58,185 --> 00:49:59,926
[SPEAKER_14]: How could you do it?

642
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:06,169
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like, once you got that thing going, it said, Tiny's Bar and Grill, 5734 5th Street, New York, New York.

643
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:18,715
[SPEAKER_14]: That old joke, I know, but... But see, that's why he has the rage, because nobody will give him a chance when he's in town or something like that.

644
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:20,296
[SPEAKER_14]: That sucked!

645
00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:33,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's talk in the chat room, and if you want to join our insane people in the chat room, you're just going to head over to any other side IRC server, like irc.acheheads.org, and you're going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

646
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking right now, they're wondering if, well, they've got one more dick joke there.

647
00:50:38,212 --> 00:50:42,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If Afro's hung like a horse, they're going to look into that, maybe get some more pictures.

648
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:44,013
[SPEAKER_14]: He gets in the contest with Dread Snake.

649
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:47,295
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Dread Snake has a beat, the name says so.

650
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, man, you've got those robots in there, too, I mean...

651
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows of that kind of stuff?

652
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:56,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, anything's possible there.

653
00:50:58,384 --> 00:51:00,165
[SPEAKER_14]: They have all those attachments, don't they?

654
00:51:02,387 --> 00:51:08,591
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we've really, really gone into the adult content, so I think maybe we need to... No, no break.

655
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:09,512
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk characters more.

656
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:12,674
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you people need to get out of the gutter because you're all stepping on me, so go away.

657
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these new characters are going to be coming out.

658
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:16,297
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

659
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:23,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's thinking about Dick.

660
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:26,095
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming out.

661
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:33,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of characters do you think will be seen with these new Konami originals?

662
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I suggested on a post like this in DDR Freak, of all places, was...

663
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:41,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I have one suggestion.

664
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:41,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Naoki's in DDR?

665
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: They should put Mr. T in there and have him look like Mr. T. He's like, I pity the fool who don't pay me.

666
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,482
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys talking?

667
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:08,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, anything?

668
00:52:08,903 --> 00:52:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Gossiping.

669
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:10,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Gossip?

670
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, come on!

671
00:52:11,224 --> 00:52:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it gossip on air!

672
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, come on!

673
00:52:13,186 --> 00:52:15,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't the KOA guy get fired or something?

674
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,130
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that's just rumor.

675
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:23,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody!

676
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:24,094
Okay.

677
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:29,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, they'll probably have, like, maybe some of the other Monty characters in there and that kind of thing.

678
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: The stupid little rabbits and... No, Pikachu's a Nintendo character.

679
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he's gonna show up.

680
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:38,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Pikachu needs to die.

681
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:40,836
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get those guys from Contra in there.

682
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

683
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:46,221
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I have this secret little plan that I'm going to take over.

684
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:50,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's right, there was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

685
00:52:51,204 --> 00:52:55,746
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome to have the turtles dancing, if the sea hasn't split their dancing.

686
00:52:56,426 --> 00:53:05,629
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, no, I have this plot going on that when I go to Tokyo next year, I'm going to take over Toei and have the rights to Digimon be my own, so we'll have Digimon and DDR, because I'm also going to take over Konami next.

687
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:06,990
[SPEAKER_14]: With a tank.

688
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do know that the last unlockable character is going to have to be something very interesting because most of them have a partner.

689
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:15,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Dracula!

690
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:17,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But the very last one is Solo.

691
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:18,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Dracula.

692
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Dracula.

693
00:53:20,471 --> 00:53:27,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm being told that anything is possible and things that you might be thinking are rumors very well could be true.

694
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:28,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can say.

695
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the guy from the Mike's Hard Lemonade commercial with the crazy head growing out of his shoulder.

696
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,661
[SPEAKER_04]: See, he's got his twin, but it's only one person.

697
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:38,681
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

698
00:53:39,461 --> 00:53:40,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, man.

699
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:42,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard inside information, okay?

700
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:46,823
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, like, what about, like, three-titted Emmy?

701
00:53:47,543 --> 00:53:53,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this, though, would make a... Honestly, Rob, I think this would make a good future list list, honestly.

702
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:56,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Or they'll have, like, sex slave Zukin in there.

703
00:53:57,365 --> 00:53:58,846
[SPEAKER_14]: No sex slave Zukin.

704
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,446
[SPEAKER_14]: We need no pants rage.

705
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:01,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Bonded jealous.

706
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:03,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys!

707
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:05,639
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no.

708
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:11,043
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can have Bondage, Alice, and Three-Tint Emmy, then I get, you know, no pants range.

709
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you gotta have, you know, that Dredd guy, you know, Dredd's everywhere, right?

710
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:19,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, anyway.

711
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Cousin Hitler Dredd's.

712
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:27,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now that's a good suggestion I'm reading in the chat room, that the last character should be a Moi head, or Maui, I can't even say that word.

713
00:54:27,815 --> 00:54:28,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Moi head.

714
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:29,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Moi, thank you.

715
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:32,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The Easter Island heads that you see in One of Gradius.

716
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:33,619
[SPEAKER_14]: But then it would get sued by Emotion.

717
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's joint ownage laws there, apparently.

718
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:43,682
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Emotion, for long-term anime fans, Emotion uses the Moai head as their mascot.

719
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:45,863
[SPEAKER_04]: What about getting Sue from Easter Island, okay?

720
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:49,704
[SPEAKER_04]: They had them way long before, you know, Emotion ever came out with it.

721
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:52,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stop now.

722
00:54:52,384 --> 00:54:59,666
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something about that, you know, the old-school Emotion, you know, intro with the little 80s, you know, drum rock.

723
00:55:01,237 --> 00:55:02,918
[SPEAKER_03]: A lovely suggestion from the chat room.

724
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:04,879
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DarkSakura dressed up as Emi?

725
00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:06,880
[SPEAKER_03]: As an unlockable character.

726
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already done that.

727
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,361
[SPEAKER_03]: But as an unlockable DDR character.

728
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:10,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

729
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:12,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go model for the lovely folks at Konami?

730
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:16,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the pictures from Fanime are still up on my FTP.

731
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:20,966
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, you know, if anybody actually wants to see, I can draw it.

732
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I have before.

733
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:23,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

734
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:24,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we'll make that for the site.

735
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:27,448
[SPEAKER_04]: HappyNoodleBoy HappyNoodleBoy

736
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:49,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Skins for... You can have Godzilla as the last character.

737
00:55:50,268 --> 00:55:51,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Go, Godzilla, go.

738
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like, on the serious side, I'm thinking that they might do, uh, just another artist, like how they did on 5th Mix with Naoki and, uh, 2MB.

739
00:55:59,855 --> 00:56:02,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I was thinking Togo and Senna.

740
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:05,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Taka.

741
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Then if you use the both of them, you have Outface.

742
00:56:11,905 --> 00:56:13,526
[SPEAKER_04]: The one-handed V another guy.

743
00:56:15,129 --> 00:56:15,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Lisu!

744
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,811
[SPEAKER_14]: We need DJ Lisu!

745
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:18,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a giant dancing hand.

746
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,617
[SPEAKER_14]: No, then they'd get sued by Nintendo for the end of Smash Brothers.

747
00:56:25,278 --> 00:56:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: With a giant hand that, you know, pokes you and flips you off the edge of the world.

748
00:56:29,862 --> 00:56:37,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, you know, the game Hand of Fate, one of the Cryorindia games, had a giant hand as the villain, so they could be sued by them, too.

749
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:47,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Matt, I ask your expert quote-unquote opinion, at least probably being the most educated on all the hacking of various DDR-related things in the room.

750
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:55,159
[SPEAKER_03]: How long is it going to be before we get people creating their own DDR characters, you think, such as Three-Titted Emmy?

751
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

752
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:01,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that all depends on how they're in there.

753
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:06,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as far as, like, the music and stuff, it looks like it's pretty much similar to, you know, DDR.

754
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one huge bin file that's in there.

755
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:12,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm gonna look at it, see what I can figure out.

756
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:17,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I'm not that great as far as hacking actual programs and stuff.

757
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:20,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good with edits, that's about it, but I'll figure out some, maybe.

758
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,225
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

759
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:30,899
[SPEAKER_14]: For anyone, I will pay someone to make me a DarkSakura as a skin for the DDRPC once I get mine.

760
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: What about PantslessRage?

761
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm more important, thank you.

762
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:37,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I get pencils made!

763
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, now that I think about it, since you do have the add-on characters now, it might be a little bit easier to make these extra characters, because you can look at that and see what's all entailed.

764
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely see it possible.

765
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, I guess I'll have to wait for that.

766
00:57:54,228 --> 00:57:56,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, I'll pay you a whole 50 cents.

767
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:58,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, those are goblin tokens, my bad.

768
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,730
[SPEAKER_14]: But they weren't getting any goblin.

769
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,130
[SPEAKER_14]: That's half a game of DDR.

770
00:58:04,562 --> 00:58:06,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, SoCalKicks is going to send that to you.

771
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,384
[SPEAKER_03]: He's volunteering to create that.

772
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:08,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

773
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:15,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, he still needs to send me proof that he, you know, got a 90%, you know, full combo on my Look to the Sky edit.

774
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Other rumors about DDRPC is that not only will you have the downloadable characters, but you're going to be able to download new interfaces and possibly some new songs.

775
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,257
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

776
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:35,040
[SPEAKER_03]: For DDRPC, do you think that's a possibility or do you think it's a load of crap?

777
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,521
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a load of crap.

778
00:58:37,702 --> 00:58:39,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a possibility and it will make it a lot better.

779
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,216
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's a load of crap.

780
00:58:42,496 --> 00:58:42,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

781
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:31,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Slightly more songs, more Konami originals, same interface, yadda yadda yadda I foresee it happened And then they're gonna have like the downloadable feature that'll like, you know, it'll allow you to un-stone Palamon Forum Blink blink, nevermind Anyway I'm nodding but none of you can hear it because the marbles in my head fell out last night with the party

782
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:34,912
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

783
00:59:53,962 --> 01:00:00,226
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

784
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:22,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It may look like that there's more arrows at the end there, but actually they don't get saved to the new file.

785
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:29,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a whole thing, a whole section in my FAQ that you can find at www.geocities.com.

786
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:29,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

787
01:00:29,923 --> 01:00:32,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

788
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:33,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And blah, blah, blah, blah.

789
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:35,926
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Edit Hack FAQ.

790
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can find that there.

791
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:37,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck?

792
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

793
01:00:38,887 --> 01:00:39,568
[SPEAKER_03]: You said fuck.

794
01:00:39,588 --> 01:00:41,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the people in the chatroom will get lucky and we'll put it there.

795
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky.

796
01:00:44,204 --> 01:00:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't feel there's going to be downloadable interfaces and songs because why do that when they can release DDRPC's second mix, Max, Ultra, 2000, three-titted EMI version.

797
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,932
[SPEAKER_14]: We do not need three-titted EMI version, thank you.

798
01:01:01,252 --> 01:01:02,733
[SPEAKER_14]: We need No Pants Rage.

799
01:01:03,965 --> 01:01:06,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, they do have all these weird games that come out.

800
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:08,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's that Matt Hoffman's BMX.

801
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually making, like, a sort of adult version of that.

802
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:12,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

803
01:01:12,189 --> 01:01:13,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dead serious, okay?

804
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,011
[SPEAKER_04]: They are making... It's, uh, what was it?

805
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:19,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Hoffman's Trip... Or, it's like Triple Extreme.

806
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm serious.

807
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen actual articles, and I've seen pictures from it.

808
01:01:24,575 --> 01:01:26,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they're going to have topless riders and stuff like that.

809
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You think... No, we meant, of course.

810
01:01:30,738 --> 01:01:31,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

811
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:32,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so...

812
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:35,691
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2.

813
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:36,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious.

814
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a picture.

815
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:39,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I will bring it next week.

816
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe they'll do something like that.

817
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they'll have strippers and that kind of thing.

818
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:47,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll see an erotic DDR mix.

819
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:48,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

820
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:48,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

821
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:57,709
[SPEAKER_14]: So all the music in it is erotic and they get, you know... What about DDR Volleyball?

822
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:00,471
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Volleyball.

823
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:02,213
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Volleyball Edition.

824
01:02:02,393 --> 01:02:03,614
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to explain the reference mode.

825
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:06,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Dead or Alive Volleyball.

826
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:08,065
[SPEAKER_18]: All the bouncing you can handle.

827
01:02:12,018 --> 01:02:22,106
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone is an old-school importer like I am, you might remember a couple of games they put out called Konami World, which were basically different adventure games.

828
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:27,170
[SPEAKER_14]: They were a little platform game that had a... Each level was taken from various popular comic games.

829
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:30,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Like there was a Dracula, a Kumajou Dracula 3.

830
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:34,676
[SPEAKER_14]: There was... Or for Castlevania, for UN-informed.

831
01:02:35,597 --> 01:02:39,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Gradius, you know, Life Force, there was all that.

832
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:39,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

833
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:52,205
[SPEAKER_14]: If they did something like that now, it'd be like the DDR minigame, like what's in Tokimeki Memorial, Dancing Summer Vacation, and they would have the pop and music minigame, the 2DX minigame, so you'd be switching out controllers the whole time.

834
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:57,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think the absolute coolest character add-on that they could do if they're going to do... Absolute...

835
01:02:58,914 --> 01:02:59,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

836
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the most cool, I don't know, anyway, characters you could download would be Goemon and the Doctor, what's his name, with the blue mustache.

837
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:10,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember?

838
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:11,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Mystical Ninja?

839
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:13,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And who actually played that?

840
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

841
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:15,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't play it.

842
01:03:15,746 --> 01:03:16,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't play it!

843
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:18,328
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew who Goemon was.

844
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:20,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be sure of all people you would have played it.

845
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:21,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I rented it once.

846
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:24,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they had, like, they had the little mini Gradius you could play.

847
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was a new version coming out, it would have a mini DDR, I guarantee you.

848
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that would actually, that would make sense.

849
01:03:29,814 --> 01:03:36,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, you know, but we've already had DDR as a mini game for, like I said, dancing, summer vacation, for all of you dating sim fans.

850
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting comment about DDR PC from our resident joker in the chatroom, Pyroman, saying that you could put the arrows on stealth and then just please yourself watching Hi-Rez Charmy.

851
01:03:53,886 --> 01:03:55,848
[SPEAKER_14]: and we have people with no sex life in our chat room.

852
01:03:56,228 --> 01:04:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, on that note, I think we're going to take a quick break and resituate some things around the room.

853
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:03,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I think our man needs to prioritize a few things.

854
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Now be nice.

855
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:07,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

856
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:08,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

857
01:04:24,554 --> 01:04:25,174
Thanks for watching!

858
01:05:02,063 --> 01:05:02,743
Thanks for watching!

859
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,411
Is your name?

860
01:06:59,023 --> 01:06:59,970
Thanks for watching!

861
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,426
Thanks for watching!

862
01:09:15,638 --> 01:09:21,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Bay Money Music and More show?

863
01:09:21,584 --> 01:09:28,732
[SPEAKER_09]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

864
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:31,054
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unearthly.

865
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:35,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

866
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a message from someone who doesn't get a date.

867
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:40,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit whispering in my ear.

868
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:45,037
[SPEAKER_03]: We're joined by the individual who likes to whisper sweet nothings into my ear.

869
01:09:45,077 --> 01:09:46,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello, everybody, to Shivam.

870
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

871
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, baby.

872
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:52,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone say hello to the bee money freaks of America, Micah?

873
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

874
01:09:56,867 --> 01:09:59,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Mikey, you don't really play these B-Money games, do you?

875
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:05,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody sucked at first, except me.

876
01:10:05,613 --> 01:10:06,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that was true.

877
01:10:06,913 --> 01:10:09,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, everybody was a newbie first.

878
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:12,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyway, moving on to a segment...

879
01:10:23,503 --> 01:10:24,464
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have to do every week.

880
01:10:24,584 --> 01:10:47,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to point out, though, however, for those of you concerned with the potty level of tonight's show, that don't like the fact that we're talking about three-titted individuals and pantsless people and whatever sorts of things, I would just like to state we right now currently have a ratings record on this show right now, so don't say that potty humor doesn't get you ratings, because we're living proof.

881
01:10:47,519 --> 01:10:52,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I think we just need to have Mike here more often just to go, fuck shit, fuck all you people, fuck...

882
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:54,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck shit.

883
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit fuck, yeah.

884
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:57,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful!

885
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,353
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another spike in the ratings.

886
01:10:58,453 --> 01:10:58,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

887
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:01,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Indeed.

888
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:02,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's just, you know what?

889
01:11:03,317 --> 01:11:07,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just get the hentai, put it in, and then we'll just say the hell with the rest of the show.

890
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go watch, we'll go play DDRPC.

891
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:11,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, no offense, fuck that, but I feel like ditching.

892
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:12,404
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

893
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:14,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're gonna get... I'm sorry, what?

894
01:11:15,006 --> 01:11:16,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna play DDRPC.

895
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:18,148
[SPEAKER_16]: DDRPC, do you have DDRPC here?

896
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

897
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:29,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Shivam, it's in the garage, running on my PC, they're politely playing right now The Sims, since The Sims has, you know, 976 songs, whereas DDRPC has 40.

898
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the math.

899
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,289
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 bad songs, so, 976, 40.

900
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:38,851
[SPEAKER_14]: I love, I, tough decision.

901
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:44,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I like, love this feeling, hello, because when, all I had was DDR's second mix on Dreamcast.

902
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:48,910
[SPEAKER_14]: That song came up four damn times in a row on my non-stop.

903
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you just love random?

904
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:51,532
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I have to laugh at?

905
01:11:51,953 --> 01:11:53,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Endless mode, extra mix.

906
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:54,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Let the beat hit them four times.

907
01:11:54,955 --> 01:11:55,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Say it again into the mic.

908
01:11:56,236 --> 01:11:57,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Endless mode, extra mix.

909
01:11:57,377 --> 01:11:59,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Let the beat hit them four times in a row.

910
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:02,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Love This Feeling has nothing on that.

911
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:11,675
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have to love is at Fry's, they have DDRPC there, and right below it they have Kiki Joys.

912
01:12:12,456 --> 01:12:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And for all this, you might be running Sims and stuff, and using Kiki Joys, they don't allow you to push two buttons at the same time when it comes to the directional buttons.

913
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:24,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because they're dumb.

914
01:12:24,806 --> 01:12:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only converter that they have.

915
01:12:26,527 --> 01:12:28,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So, wait, who's the company that did it?

916
01:12:29,289 --> 01:12:31,171
[SPEAKER_02]: That issued Kiki Joy?

917
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:32,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

918
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:33,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard of them.

919
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:34,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Never heard of them.

920
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't work.

921
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:36,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I own one.

922
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, if you have a Kiki Joy, fucking light that shit on fire, take a shit on it, and smoke that shit.

923
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: The big indicator first is it's a giant pink object.

924
01:12:51,598 --> 01:12:53,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing to say about that color.

925
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:58,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen giant pink objects like that inserted in places, you know, not used properly.

926
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on, let's do this real quick.

927
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:07,941
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a Kiki Joy right now, tell us, if you're on the channel, tell us if it works good for you or not.

928
01:13:08,162 --> 01:13:11,162
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, then just tell us whatever the fuck you want out here.

929
01:13:11,182 --> 01:13:15,003
[SPEAKER_14]: In defense of the Kiki Joy, it does work quite well for Metal Gear Solid on PC.

930
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:19,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying that it doesn't work on a dance pad?

931
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work because you can't push left and right or up and down at the same time.

932
01:13:42,582 --> 01:13:44,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what about a regular controller?

933
01:13:44,323 --> 01:13:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a regular controller is fine.

934
01:13:45,244 --> 01:13:47,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what most people... I'm sorry.

935
01:13:47,946 --> 01:13:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what most people probably do on the PC anyways.

936
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:53,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... But when you buy DDR, you don't...

937
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:55,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to go, oh, I'm going to go buy a plate.

938
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:57,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Call the pad, okay?

939
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:58,730
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about the control.

940
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,670
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about the DDR personal massager, actually.

941
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody knows they want their big bumblebee in the back, right?

942
01:14:04,031 --> 01:14:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of fucking things... Anyway, let's change the subject now, because we've got to get to Jamie's F... And actually, everybody's going to participate.

943
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:12,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not everybody, but, you know, the important people.

944
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:13,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

945
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:16,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that I had... We'll be participating in the FU of the week this week.

946
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:19,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Two of the topics I had to bitch about are going to be covered by other people.

947
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:19,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

948
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,214
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I will mention them.

949
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:21,094
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

950
01:14:21,194 --> 01:14:21,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Cue my music!

951
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:24,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, this is fucked up.

952
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:26,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, this is bad.

953
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:33,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, my fuck you of the week, once again, just like last weekend, the week before, goes toward Ragnarok Online.

954
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:38,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, also as... I don't care.

955
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,910
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my fuck you, so fuck you.

956
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:46,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, or as my friend referred to it as Cracknarok, but still.

957
01:14:47,352 --> 01:14:48,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, um...

958
01:14:49,577 --> 01:15:00,164
[SPEAKER_14]: For any people who have been keeping up with the game, and I'm sorry for people who have recently downloaded Syrah, the international servers have gone down for three months.

959
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:09,330
[SPEAKER_14]: They've gone the further step to ban any North American, European IPs that try to play on the Japanese or Korean servers.

960
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:13,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I had gotten to where I was enjoying it.

961
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:15,413
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't kicking me off nearly so much.

962
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:18,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And guess what happened?

963
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:19,904
[SPEAKER_14]: They go down for three months.

964
01:15:19,984 --> 01:15:22,227
[SPEAKER_14]: So fuck them, fuck them and their stupid asses.

965
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:24,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm downloading a different game now.

966
01:15:25,471 --> 01:15:29,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And the next fuck you of the week goes toward AT&T, which I also hate.

967
01:15:29,576 --> 01:15:31,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my fuck you of the week.

968
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:39,402
[SPEAKER_03]: is for AT&T Cable, because they've given us such wonderful new channels this week.

969
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:49,371
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Noggin, which is, Noggin fucking rules, because they show the old school 80s Nickelodeon things, and early 90s.

970
01:15:49,431 --> 01:15:52,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Clarissa Explains It All was on, and all this stuff.

971
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:55,937
[SPEAKER_03]: We get G4, which is the new All Video Games All The Time channel.

972
01:15:56,717 --> 01:15:59,899
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have, what else was on there, BBC America.

973
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:00,479
[SPEAKER_14]: MTV2.

974
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:02,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does this count as a fuck you again?

975
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And MTV2.

976
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:10,644
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why this is a fuck you of the week, when I tried to access these channels, it said, we're sorry, this is a subscription service.

977
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we're already raping you $50 a month for cable, if you want these channels, you're going to have to pay $20 more.

978
01:16:16,106 --> 01:16:18,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, I pay too much for my cable already.

979
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:25,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why don't you take off these shitty channels I don't want, like, I don't know, MSNBC, and give me...

980
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:27,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Oxygen.

981
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

982
01:16:29,263 --> 01:16:34,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Take off Lifetime with its fucking... The only fucking cool thing on Lifetime is Shop Till You Drop.

983
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:37,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have that on PAX now.

984
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:40,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave Oxygen on, because I got that old lady with the penis talk show.

985
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:41,833
[SPEAKER_02]: You seen that?

986
01:16:41,853 --> 01:16:42,834
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, this is a dick.

987
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: You put this in a lady's pussy hole.

988
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:58,114
[SPEAKER_17]: But on Lifetime also they have tons of stories about like lesbians and them getting like raped by their parents and then running away and becoming foster children and all the fucked up shit that you can have all in one like hour and a half show.

989
01:16:58,234 --> 01:16:59,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I think you need to cue my music again.

990
01:17:00,155 --> 01:17:03,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being told in the chat room that they will activate the channels for free.

991
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:06,336
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is call maybe for the first month.

992
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:09,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, if they're free, why don't they just give them to me?

993
01:17:09,497 --> 01:17:10,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have to call?

994
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to take a survey?

995
01:17:13,012 --> 01:17:17,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you, sir, a 24-year-old individual, want to be watching Noggin Network?

996
01:17:18,274 --> 01:17:19,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a pedophile, sir?

997
01:17:19,294 --> 01:17:20,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No, dammit, I just want to relive my youth.

998
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:21,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that so wrong?

999
01:17:22,455 --> 01:17:23,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Jamie's music.

1000
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:24,676
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to re-key my music again.

1001
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:30,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Because my fuck you of the week goes toward AT&T Broadband.

1002
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:51,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm sure quite a few of the people listening know of my drama with AT&T, how I'd be kicked off every few moments, hop up on the tile, go downstairs to check the mode, see that it's back on, go ahead, sign off, AOL, hop back on, and, you know, it's getting frustrating, especially when I was in the middle of, you know, playing that crack game.

1003
01:17:51,216 --> 01:17:52,157
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck them.

1004
01:17:52,757 --> 01:17:54,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck them and their stupid asses.

1005
01:17:55,885 --> 01:17:56,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

1006
01:17:56,545 --> 01:18:01,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Matt also has a Fuck You of the Week, and I don't have any music really for Matt, so I'm just going to give him It's Raining Men.

1007
01:18:04,148 --> 01:18:07,129
[SPEAKER_04]: My first Fuck You of the Week goes to Rob, forgive me, It's Raining Men.

1008
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:09,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not right.

1009
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:15,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, my Fuck You of the Week goes to Fuck You of the Week.

1010
01:18:17,352 --> 01:18:18,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than It's Raining Men.

1011
01:18:19,753 --> 01:18:24,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways, so we're going to give the Fuck You of the Week to Panda Express.

1012
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Panda Express is like this wannabe Chinese food fast food place.

1013
01:18:30,576 --> 01:18:35,458
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, like, a few things to order, I mean, and today they're out of practically everything.

1014
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:40,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone want anything, uh, other, well, white rice, anyone want white rice?

1015
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I guess, okay, I'll get white rice.

1016
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:52,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, practically out of everything else, and they, you know, put my stuff in the bag, my napkins got soaked in, I don't know what, some sort of juice.

1017
01:18:53,044 --> 01:18:53,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood.

1018
01:18:53,244 --> 01:18:54,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, blood, I guess.

1019
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:58,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Panda Express is going to give you AIDS.

1020
01:18:59,015 --> 01:19:01,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably Panda I was eating anyways.

1021
01:19:01,756 --> 01:19:02,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not the point.

1022
01:19:03,817 --> 01:19:04,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1023
01:19:04,597 --> 01:19:06,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I got sick from my lunch today.

1024
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:08,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was avoiding meat for that reason.

1025
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,880
[SPEAKER_03]: What pissed me off, I wanted chow mein.

1026
01:19:12,521 --> 01:19:23,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to wait 25 minutes for them to fucking make some new chow mein because they didn't think that, oh, when it's empty, when it's starting to get empty and we've got a line going out the door, maybe it's time to make some more, you know?

1027
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:27,488
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not that they could, you know, foresee these things in advance.

1028
01:19:27,508 --> 01:19:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to run out of it first, and then I'll be the next person in line that's like, oh, you gotta wait 25 minutes so we can make more domain.

1029
01:19:33,914 --> 01:19:34,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you!

1030
01:19:34,954 --> 01:19:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And my second, uh, my second FU week goes to the stupid bitch at, uh, Fry's.

1031
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let, here's a little information for you.

1032
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm peeing with a credit card, that means I'm over 18, you dumb bitch.

1033
01:19:50,942 --> 01:19:54,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't ask me if I'm 18 if I have a credit card here.

1034
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if I'm buying the anime porn?

1035
01:19:57,606 --> 01:19:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean anything.

1036
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The dumb bitch had the nerve to tell me.

1037
01:20:02,128 --> 01:20:03,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, she's like, are you 18?

1038
01:20:04,129 --> 01:20:05,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's not necessarily true.

1039
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:05,830
[SPEAKER_16]: My brother's only 16.

1040
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:07,371
[SPEAKER_16]: He's got an ATM credit card.

1041
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:09,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an ATM card!

1042
01:20:11,294 --> 01:20:13,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ATM card, okay?

1043
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:15,329
[SPEAKER_04]: ATM card!

1044
01:20:15,389 --> 01:20:19,350
[SPEAKER_04]: She said her 11-year-old son had a fucking credit card.

1045
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:21,531
[SPEAKER_04]: How the fuck is he gonna pay off a credit card?

1046
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:23,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The goddamn kid can't even work!

1047
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:27,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but have you been accused of having a false ID when you're 26 years old at the convention?

1048
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:30,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been called to hold a platinum card, dude, so it's not even really funny.

1049
01:20:30,853 --> 01:20:35,354
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not, but I've been refused a movie because I didn't have my ID with me.

1050
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:38,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid Chico Theater not letting me see Deadman on campus.

1051
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:41,935
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be thanking them.

1052
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did see that later on, yeah, I'm scarred for life.

1053
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:51,104
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I was at, this was one of my other fuck you's from Anime Expo that I haven't brought up yet.

1054
01:20:51,644 --> 01:20:57,247
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that when I went to go buy, by the way, the doujinshi didn't turn out to be yaoi, by the way, you know.

1055
01:20:57,807 --> 01:21:00,868
[SPEAKER_16]: No yaoi, oh no, no gay penis, what will we do?

1056
01:21:01,369 --> 01:21:07,331
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, the guy there, the guy there wanted me to get my mom, so that I could buy doujinshi.

1057
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:13,370
[SPEAKER_14]: and then I showed him my license and my ID.

1058
01:21:15,391 --> 01:21:24,055
[SPEAKER_04]: On the topic of anime porn, I have another FU that's long overdue that goes to the stupid makers of that movie, Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.

1059
01:21:24,195 --> 01:21:26,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddamn, that movie sucks ass.

1060
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like horrible flash anime.

1061
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:28,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Who the fuck bought that?

1062
01:21:29,178 --> 01:21:29,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1063
01:21:30,138 --> 01:21:35,681
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a horrible flash anime that someone made years and years ago and someone actually went out and published.

1064
01:21:35,741 --> 01:21:37,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe you paid for it.

1065
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,983
[SPEAKER_16]: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1066
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:40,635
[SPEAKER_12]: It was funny.

1067
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:41,535
[SPEAKER_12]: He was dumb.

1068
01:21:42,636 --> 01:21:46,257
[SPEAKER_12]: I was stupid again.

1069
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:46,317
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

1070
01:21:48,397 --> 01:21:50,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, have we got to the fucking everyone?

1071
01:21:51,818 --> 01:21:54,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

1072
01:21:55,259 --> 01:21:55,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Now serving, 47.

1073
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:01,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, DDRholic, hi by the way.

1074
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we see you at Golfland this week.

1075
01:22:04,427 --> 01:22:08,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Says that they issue credit cards to kids with prepaid limits from Daddy.

1076
01:22:08,811 --> 01:22:15,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of those secured credit cards where, like, Daddy pays $300 so, you know, Junior can have a $300 credit card to buy anime porn with.

1077
01:22:15,938 --> 01:22:21,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but my credit card didn't say, oh, look, it's a kid card, you know, with the big happy smiley face and the rainbow.

1078
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:23,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have Ronald McDonald on it.

1079
01:22:24,346 --> 01:22:24,987
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't.

1080
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:31,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And the dumb bitch didn't even have the smarts to look at my fucking, you know... So you didn't get the Sailor Moon platinum card then?

1081
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:33,309
[SPEAKER_16]: To go with your Seven Balls purchase?

1082
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:34,849
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did not.

1083
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,450
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe you bought that, dude.

1084
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:37,090
[SPEAKER_16]: What the fuck?

1085
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:42,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Of all the goddamn gimpy anime porn out there, you got something that I could make in my fucking sleeve.

1086
01:22:43,752 --> 01:22:45,292
[SPEAKER_14]: He wouldn't have the Sailor Moon one.

1087
01:22:45,312 --> 01:22:48,513
[SPEAKER_14]: He's, you know, did think he was younger, so he had, like, Superdoll Lekotan or something.

1088
01:22:49,053 --> 01:22:50,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, my Gundam credit card.

1089
01:22:50,475 --> 01:22:52,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, okay, I like watching... Platinum 2.

1090
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:57,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I like watching 10 frame animation with stupid sound clips repeated over and over again.

1091
01:22:57,465 --> 01:22:58,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Then play DDR.

1092
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Oh yeah, gotcha there.

1093
01:23:05,572 --> 01:23:06,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

1094
01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:09,875
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like the song selects sequence.

1095
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:13,938
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you sit there and listen to the worst sample out of the fucking one and a half minutes they could possibly pick.

1096
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:21,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that would kind of bring us back to that old topic we were just talking about, about the characters and all the... No pants rage.

1097
01:23:23,105 --> 01:23:24,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, moving right along.

1098
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know to what.

1099
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:28,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have any other subjects to discuss today.

1100
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:30,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Patsy Blue.

1101
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:31,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, hold on.

1102
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:33,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get to talk again.

1103
01:23:34,478 --> 01:23:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Pepsi Blue is really good.

1104
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:36,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, shut up!

1105
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Pepsi Blue is hella good.

1106
01:23:40,781 --> 01:23:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody at the tournament was drinking that.

1107
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:43,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up!

1108
01:23:44,203 --> 01:23:45,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, anyway.

1109
01:23:45,804 --> 01:23:46,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was good.

1110
01:23:47,185 --> 01:23:49,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Rediffusion takes, like, cough syrup.

1111
01:23:49,746 --> 01:23:51,247
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think, Jens?

1112
01:23:52,242 --> 01:23:53,243
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Red Fusion better.

1113
01:23:53,623 --> 01:23:54,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to hell anyways.

1114
01:23:55,204 --> 01:23:56,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Pepsi Blue owns your daddy.

1115
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell some stories.

1116
01:23:58,707 --> 01:24:04,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about, let's make this be Imani related and talk about refreshing drinks to play when playing DDR.

1117
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:05,273
Pocari Sweat.

1118
01:24:06,514 --> 01:24:15,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, obviously Ramun, which is probably the greatest drink that ever came in a pixie cup with that damn marble in there so you can't tell how much fucking liquid is in there to begin with.

1119
01:24:16,622 --> 01:24:17,362
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no.

1120
01:24:17,443 --> 01:24:19,104
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about Pocari Sweat.

1121
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:20,610
[SPEAKER_16]: What the fuck?

1122
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:21,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Pokari Sweat.

1123
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:28,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Pokari Sweat looks like sweat, smells like sweat, tastes like sweetened sweat, and comes in a goddamn bottle that says sweat.

1124
01:24:29,715 --> 01:24:32,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Pokari Sweat is the absolute winner of all fitness drinks.

1125
01:24:33,016 --> 01:24:35,797
[SPEAKER_16]: It's one of the worst sports drinks I've ever had in my goddamn life.

1126
01:24:36,598 --> 01:24:39,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to thank Shiva for that lovely description of Pokari Sweat.

1127
01:24:39,519 --> 01:24:40,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Captain Obvious!

1128
01:24:42,065 --> 01:24:44,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, you couldn't have thought of a better fucking name for it.

1129
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:49,870
[SPEAKER_14]: It tastes like, it's citrusy, but it's supposed to be like Gatorade, but it doesn't taste like shit.

1130
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:51,351
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like salty water.

1131
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:52,872
[SPEAKER_16]: And it tastes like it, too.

1132
01:24:53,313 --> 01:24:54,694
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not as salty as Gatorade.

1133
01:24:54,814 --> 01:24:57,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that shit that you bought at... My Propel Water is winter.

1134
01:24:57,816 --> 01:24:58,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel Water, I like that.

1135
01:24:58,997 --> 01:25:00,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Propel Water is absolute winter.

1136
01:25:00,778 --> 01:25:09,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of the Gatorade sweat thing, I mean, you know, you see them sweating out that shit, and I'm sure they're just collecting it, and there you go, that's how they get that shit, you know?

1137
01:25:12,835 --> 01:25:23,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I've already stated that when we open our Tapioca Express, I'm going to try to have a Pocari Sweat Vending Machine.

1138
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:26,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Boba's an entirely different subject, man.

1139
01:25:26,528 --> 01:25:27,990
[SPEAKER_16]: I had that freaking starfruit flavor.

1140
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:28,590
[SPEAKER_16]: It tasted like ass.

1141
01:25:29,651 --> 01:25:31,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1142
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:52,239
[SPEAKER_03]: and Rob with the... No, no, not those.

1143
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:55,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about like actual little balls.

1144
01:25:55,182 --> 01:25:57,204
[SPEAKER_14]: You can use them to give someone a back massage.

1145
01:25:58,285 --> 01:25:58,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1146
01:25:59,085 --> 01:26:00,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Balls!

1147
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:01,748
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1148
01:26:03,049 --> 01:26:07,833
[SPEAKER_14]: The Propel water basically tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid shit, so it's really awesome.

1149
01:26:09,254 --> 01:26:10,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we got plenty of time.

1150
01:26:10,075 --> 01:26:10,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares, dude?

1151
01:26:10,815 --> 01:26:11,836
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk until they throw us off.

1152
01:26:13,146 --> 01:26:17,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, share with us.

1153
01:26:17,191 --> 01:26:19,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you start your story, I'm going to give you story music, okay?

1154
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:24,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's find some story music for Mike.

1155
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:26,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about our little Mexican friend, Jose.

1156
01:26:27,523 --> 01:26:30,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Now don't make this a racist story or I'm going to have to... Okay, okay.

1157
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:31,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

1158
01:26:33,089 --> 01:26:33,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1159
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:35,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

1160
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:40,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to Mike and let's hear Mike's story.

1161
01:26:40,192 --> 01:26:44,454
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the music?

1162
01:26:45,254 --> 01:26:46,275
[SPEAKER_03]: The Journey to Wonderland.

1163
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:47,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Word!

1164
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:54,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, okay, as all of you know, you know the guy, Jose, who ran the Fremont tournament.

1165
01:26:56,292 --> 01:27:12,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you all know he was at the tournament on Thursday and Friday, and a couple of my friends, DCB and Chaos, come up to me and they randomly ask me, why does Jose smell like shit?

1166
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is he wearing the same clothes as he was the day before?

1167
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really afraid of where this is going.

1168
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:25,502
[SPEAKER_02]: You've all been to Sunnyvale Golf Land, hopefully, and you've all seen the giant clown mouth.

1170
01:27:55,675 --> 01:27:59,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be funny, but nobody's laughing, so I feel like an idiot now.

1171
01:28:00,259 --> 01:28:00,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blinking.

1172
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not laughing at you, we're laughing inside.

1208
01:36:42,174 --> 01:36:43,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you take vocal lessons?

1209
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:44,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill your teacher.

1210
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,057

01:36:56,032 --> 01:36:57,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that was cool.

1216
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:00,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you even know why you're here?

1217
01:37:00,638 --> 01:37:02,941
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just bloody pathetic, Nyx!

1218
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,824
Come on, Ava.

1219
01:37:05,864 --> 01:37:07,326

01:37:11,778 --> 01:37:17,082
[SPEAKER_11]: A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1224
01:37:17,102 --> 01:37:19,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, chat room demanding we make some new promos tonight.

1225
01:37:19,644 --> 01:37:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sick of these ones.

1226
01:37:20,404 --> 01:37:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I believe them.

1227
01:37:21,185 --> 01:37:21,986
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1228
01:37:22,026 --> 01:37:24,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I would assume that we could do a few more.

1229
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:24,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1230
01:37:24,407 --> 01:37:28,010
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we could talk about No Pants Rage and 3-Ted Evie.

1231
01:37:30,252 --> 01:37:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1232
01:37:30,852 --> 01:37:31,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray for boobies.

1233
01:37:31,773 --> 01:37:34,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they're suggesting maybe something involving Politary.

1234
01:37:34,134 --> 01:37:35,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1235
01:37:36,316 --> 01:37:38,578
[SPEAKER_14]: How about us killing Politary in front of Corona Blender?

1236
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:43,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we come up with during the week.

1237
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's see.

1238
01:37:47,674 --> 01:37:48,274
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did they say?

1239
01:37:48,294 --> 01:37:48,975
[SPEAKER_03]: They said something else.

1240
01:37:49,075 --> 01:37:53,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, they wanted us to talk about how American Idol is trying to warp our minds.

1241
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:54,760
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we have a segment to do.

1242
01:37:54,881 --> 01:37:56,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to do Listless.

1243
01:37:57,323 --> 01:37:57,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1244
01:37:57,763 --> 01:37:59,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're going to bring back another.

1245
01:37:59,305 --> 01:38:01,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of old shit, we're going to do...

1246
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:05,401
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1247
01:38:33,843 --> 01:38:46,869
[SPEAKER_14]: and then we each go around and we put up our items until we have a list, in this case of 15, then each of us goes around voting to put one off, then we leave it to our chatroom to vote what the final result's going to be.

1248
01:38:47,749 --> 01:38:49,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you think I summed that up nicely?

1249
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:54,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so on that note... Let's play Listless!

1250
01:38:55,613 --> 01:38:58,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That was way too easy.

1251
01:38:58,394 --> 01:38:59,275
[SPEAKER_14]: That was beautiful though.

1252
01:39:00,797 --> 01:39:01,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of lovely intelligence.

1253
01:39:02,338 --> 01:39:03,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So who wants to start this one?

1254
01:39:03,578 --> 01:39:04,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with our guests.

1255
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:05,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with our guests.

1256
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:07,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you're number... Oh, our topic tonight.

1257
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:09,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, we have a topic tonight.

1258
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:13,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And that topic is what we feel is the best 2DX video.

1259
01:39:13,421 --> 01:39:15,822
[SPEAKER_03]: The best videos in 2DX ever.

1260
01:39:15,922 --> 01:39:19,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chat room, you guys are going to get a chance to vote on our finished list.

1261
01:39:19,743 --> 01:39:21,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys will determine the top three.

1262
01:39:21,964 --> 01:39:22,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

1263
01:39:22,864 --> 01:39:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with DDR Mike giving his number three pick.

1264
01:39:26,285 --> 01:39:29,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my number three pick would be Wow Wow 70s.

1265
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:31,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, good choice, Wow Wow 70s.

1266
01:39:32,691 --> 01:39:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two!

1267
01:39:33,372 --> 01:39:35,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, no, no, no, you don't get to explain it.

1268
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:35,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain it?

1269
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a brief synopsis for those that may not have seen it.

1270
01:39:38,557 --> 01:39:46,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The song kicks ass, and... No, fuck that shit.

1271
01:39:47,105 --> 01:39:49,127
[SPEAKER_02]: The song just kicks ass, I'm just gonna say that.

1272
01:39:50,419 --> 01:39:51,600
[SPEAKER_02]: The video is really cool.

1273
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really detailed.

1274
01:39:53,662 --> 01:39:55,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they have all the characters and shit in it.

1275
01:39:56,704 --> 01:40:00,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Colors or Frozen Wave with all that fucking gay shit.

1276
01:40:00,868 --> 01:40:02,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, come on, Justin.

1277
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:03,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Your pick.

1278
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1279
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs a microphone to do it.

1280
01:40:05,872 --> 01:40:08,934
[SPEAKER_18]: For number three, I pick a song that I cannot say.

1281
01:40:09,935 --> 01:40:11,637
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's how you say it.

1282
01:40:12,317 --> 01:40:18,082
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a video from Second Cell, I believe, and the girl is dancing in the window.

1283
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,627
[SPEAKER_18]: All she does through the video, dance in the window and sing the song.

1284
01:40:21,907 --> 01:40:22,767
[SPEAKER_18]: How cool can you get?

1285
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:28,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool as Ice, featuring Vanilla Ice.

1286
01:40:31,072 --> 01:40:32,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how about Matt?

1287
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:35,851
[SPEAKER_04]: My pick would have to go to G2.

1288
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:36,711
[SPEAKER_04]: G2.

1289
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:39,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And briefly explain G2 a little bit.

1290
01:40:40,173 --> 01:40:44,415
[SPEAKER_04]: G2 has the creepy alien chick flying around looking like something.

1291
01:40:44,435 --> 01:40:44,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Tran.

1292
01:40:45,135 --> 01:40:49,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Tran flying around looking like she's attacking the cameraman.

1293
01:40:49,237 --> 01:40:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very dark and goes with the song very well.

1294
01:40:52,078 --> 01:40:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1295
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Shamey.

1296
01:40:54,568 --> 01:41:08,223
[SPEAKER_14]: My number three, um, which, uh, from my list would have to be Ride on the Light, because, uh, well, as my fiancé has described it, it's basically, um, like an Eva, Evangelion fight done with little chibi thingies.

1297
01:41:09,724 --> 01:41:10,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough.

1298
01:41:10,725 --> 01:41:15,951
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick is, uh, Right Now by Atomic Kitten, because, um,

1299
01:41:17,997 --> 01:41:23,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I like crap, and it reminds me of Spice Girls, so there you go, right now.

1300
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:26,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, Rob, I'm going to be giving you an early birthday present.

1301
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:27,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1302
01:41:29,181 --> 01:41:30,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, alright.

1303
01:41:30,562 --> 01:41:31,422
[SPEAKER_14]: What, are you going to fart?

1304
01:41:32,903 --> 01:41:34,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a present, okay.

1305
01:41:35,363 --> 01:41:37,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a present everyone can share.

1306
01:41:37,584 --> 01:41:38,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, there it is.

1307
01:41:38,505 --> 01:41:42,206
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's not the Spice Girls, if you're talking about crap, it's the Shice Girls.

1308
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:44,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, you're right.

1309
01:41:44,912 --> 01:41:47,414
[SPEAKER_03]: GDR Mike, let's hear the number two choice of yours.

1310
01:41:47,834 --> 01:41:51,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two for me would be 250 BPM.

1311
01:41:51,197 --> 01:41:51,638
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 BPM.

1312
01:41:51,698 --> 01:41:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the crazy shit, baby, devil baby fucking schizo shit.

1313
01:41:57,603 --> 01:41:58,663
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm about to have a seizure.

1314
01:41:59,304 --> 01:42:00,625
[SPEAKER_14]: The Satan fetus must die.

1315
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:02,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1316
01:42:02,567 --> 01:42:03,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the fucking fetus.

1317
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,231
[SPEAKER_18]: My pick is Love is Dreaminess.

1318
01:42:07,431 --> 01:42:08,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is Dreaminess.

1319
01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:18,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because running robots are that cool.

1320
01:42:20,122 --> 01:42:24,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my second pick would have to go to Romeo and Juliet.

1321
01:42:24,885 --> 01:42:25,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Romeo and Juliet.

1322
01:42:25,725 --> 01:42:28,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of those crazy neon bears in the background.

1323
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so cute.

1324
01:42:31,264 --> 01:42:35,626
[SPEAKER_14]: My number two would have to be for the cutest video ever, Sweet Lab.

1325
01:42:36,026 --> 01:42:36,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Lab.

1326
01:42:36,566 --> 01:42:37,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good pick.

1327
01:42:37,326 --> 01:42:40,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even think of that one.

1328
01:42:41,028 --> 01:42:41,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cute.

1329
01:42:41,468 --> 01:42:41,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1330
01:42:41,648 --> 01:42:43,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Briefly describe the Sweet Lab video a little bit.

1331
01:42:43,409 --> 01:42:50,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just us little cute little thingies walking through the forest being cute and doing more cute things.

1332
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:53,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I hardly ever get to watch the video because usually I'm cussing at the song while I'm playing it.

1333
01:42:56,274 --> 01:42:56,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1334
01:42:57,214 --> 01:42:57,415
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1335
01:42:58,035 --> 01:42:58,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackers!

1336
01:42:59,246 --> 01:43:00,326
[SPEAKER_03]: How could you forget that?

1337
01:43:00,426 --> 01:43:01,527
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1338
01:43:01,567 --> 01:43:03,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't here when we started making our picks.

1339
01:43:03,107 --> 01:43:04,048
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't play right now.

1340
01:43:04,468 --> 01:43:05,188
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play next week.

1341
01:43:05,908 --> 01:43:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1342
01:43:06,668 --> 01:43:07,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen, though.

1343
01:43:08,089 --> 01:43:09,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody has Cracker right now.

1344
01:43:09,769 --> 01:43:12,370
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not to the end of the list yet.

1345
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:13,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not to the end of the list yet.

1346
01:43:15,171 --> 01:43:15,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1347
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:16,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

1348
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:17,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, my pick.

1349
01:43:17,632 --> 01:43:19,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I get your pick right now?

1350
01:43:19,232 --> 01:43:20,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Sweet Lab, I did get it right now.

1351
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:23,974
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick is a very new one, but it's fucking hilarious.

1352
01:43:24,034 --> 01:43:24,774
[SPEAKER_03]: The Strong Yeager.

1353
01:43:25,788 --> 01:43:29,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, with, with, you know, the, with Dungeon Jay humping himself.

1354
01:43:31,653 --> 01:43:32,894
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's, wasn't that a Jaeger?

1355
01:43:33,414 --> 01:43:34,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't you say that?

1356
01:43:35,736 --> 01:43:37,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so the strong Jaeger.

1357
01:43:39,339 --> 01:43:42,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Shivam's trying to take over the controls here, but he can't because we're trying to do something here.

1358
01:43:43,222 --> 01:43:44,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, number one picks.

1359
01:43:45,704 --> 01:43:51,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my number one pick would be Cheer Train, because it has the coolest lyrics ever.

1360
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1361
01:43:54,391 --> 01:44:00,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's all clay animation and shit, and, like, the stop animation is really cool.

1362
01:44:01,674 --> 01:44:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1363
01:44:02,074 --> 01:44:02,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like, I like Sheertrain.

1364
01:44:02,974 --> 01:44:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, cool, cool, cool.

1365
01:44:05,475 --> 01:44:05,735
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

1366
01:44:05,775 --> 01:44:06,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

1367
01:44:06,655 --> 01:44:07,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Go figure, that was mine.

1368
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, alright, Sheertrain, number one pick for you too, alright, fair enough.

1369
01:44:12,217 --> 01:44:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my all-time favorite has to be, uh, Gradius Cyber.

1370
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

1371
01:44:19,417 --> 01:44:20,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever!

1372
01:44:20,178 --> 01:44:20,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1373
01:44:20,818 --> 01:44:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I made the same mistake last week.

1374
01:44:23,701 --> 01:44:28,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a really kick-ass animation video, very similar to Burning Heat, but it's awesome.

1375
01:44:28,245 --> 01:44:31,248
[SPEAKER_14]: You always call it graduistic, and that is not right.

1376
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:33,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1377
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:34,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1378
01:44:34,872 --> 01:44:35,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do what I want.

1379
01:44:35,612 --> 01:44:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do what I want.

1380
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:37,774
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually changing my number one.

1381
01:44:38,155 --> 01:44:38,575
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't.

1382
01:44:39,036 --> 01:44:39,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Too bad.

1383
01:44:39,576 --> 01:44:40,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a woman.

1384
01:44:40,437 --> 01:44:40,857
[SPEAKER_14]: I can do it.

1385
01:44:40,877 --> 01:44:41,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I have boobs.

1386
01:44:42,679 --> 01:44:44,541
[SPEAKER_14]: As much as I love reincarnation...

1387
01:44:46,475 --> 01:44:53,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually am going to vote for Burning Heat simply because I am such a Gradius II fan, it's not even funny.

1388
01:44:54,379 --> 01:45:00,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And that just is like, completely brings back the frustration of, you know, fighting the Fire Dragons and everything.

1389
01:45:00,582 --> 01:45:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1390
01:45:01,242 --> 01:45:04,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my number one pick also happens to already be on the list.

1391
01:45:04,244 --> 01:45:06,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I put down Love is Dreaminess as my number one pick, so.

1392
01:45:06,685 --> 01:45:08,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you can stick with Reincarnation.

1393
01:45:09,523 --> 01:45:12,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll, uh, I don't know, give it to a wild card.

1394
01:45:12,645 --> 01:45:14,225
[SPEAKER_03]: We never hear from Bradley on this show.

1395
01:45:14,245 --> 01:45:14,565
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?

1396
01:45:14,585 --> 01:45:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a wild card pick.

1397
01:45:15,606 --> 01:45:19,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Any 2DX video.

1398
01:45:20,768 --> 01:45:21,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Think, man, think!

1399
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:28,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the video, but that's not my favorite.

1400
01:45:28,112 --> 01:45:30,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Outer Wall.

1401
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:32,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Outer Wall.

1402
01:45:32,454 --> 01:45:33,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall, okay.

1403
01:45:33,514 --> 01:45:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a wild card pick.

1404
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:34,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall.

1405
01:45:36,912 --> 01:45:37,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the fun part!

1406
01:45:37,953 --> 01:45:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're gonna go around the room and you get to take one song off of the list.

1407
01:45:41,856 --> 01:45:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So, starting with... DDR Mike.

1408
01:45:44,578 --> 01:45:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the list right in front of you?

1409
01:45:45,618 --> 01:45:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take off any one of those songs you think, why the hell is that song there?

1410
01:45:51,462 --> 01:45:54,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Romeo and Juliet, because fuck, fuck, fuck Para!

1411
01:45:55,445 --> 01:45:57,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And fuck all you Paralists out there!

1412
01:45:57,767 --> 01:45:58,968
[SPEAKER_15]: You fucking faggots!

1413
01:45:59,528 --> 01:46:01,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking die, ParaParaTiger!

1414
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:04,552
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna fucking cut your dick off, you bitch!

1415
01:46:05,552 --> 01:46:06,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I encourage people to rave on Parapara.

1416
01:46:06,873 --> 01:46:11,255
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send those cards and letters to DDR Mike, Kara of Sunnyvale Golfland.

1417
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:16,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say, Romeo and Juliet is off the list.

1418
01:46:16,178 --> 01:46:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and a big hearty fuck you Mike from the chat room.

1419
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,081
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1420
01:46:22,421 --> 01:46:23,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I say bye bye to G2.

1421
01:46:24,302 --> 01:46:25,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye to G2.

1422
01:46:27,444 --> 01:46:27,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So long.

1423
01:46:28,284 --> 01:46:28,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

1424
01:46:29,365 --> 01:46:29,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

1425
01:46:31,077 --> 01:46:35,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to say bye-bye to your drink because I hate the lyrics.

1426
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:39,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the lyrics and I think the little peeps are stupid.

1427
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Stand by to win.

1428
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:42,781
[SPEAKER_14]: No, stand by to lose.

1429
01:46:45,082 --> 01:46:49,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I vote for 2.50 BPM to go bye-bye because this Satan fetus scares me.

1430
01:46:49,863 --> 01:46:55,425
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I literally had nightmares about the damn Satan fetus when I first played Fourth Style, so no.

1431
01:46:56,698 --> 01:46:59,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm taking off.

1432
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to do it, but Toto at Kazan, no, I, no, that's second style.

1433
01:47:03,904 --> 01:47:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too old.

1434
01:47:04,624 --> 01:47:05,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too old.

1435
01:47:05,045 --> 01:47:05,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's gone.

1436
01:47:05,845 --> 01:47:07,367
[SPEAKER_07]: It's classic.

1437
01:47:08,728 --> 01:47:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So that leaves us with our list.

1438
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow Wow 70s, Ride on the Light, Right Now, How did that stay?

1439
01:47:17,254 --> 01:47:17,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy.

1440
01:47:18,235 --> 01:47:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is Dreaminess, Sweet Lab, The Strong Jaeger, Graduistic Cyber,

1441
01:47:25,327 --> 01:47:28,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning Heat, and Outer Wall.

1442
01:47:28,309 --> 01:47:29,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are our choices.

1443
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:32,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you would like to vote on those, you have to be in the chat room.

1444
01:47:32,572 --> 01:47:35,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send me a private message with your vote.

1445
01:47:36,055 --> 01:47:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You just double-click on my name, it comes up a new window.

1446
01:47:38,496 --> 01:47:39,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's SkyOL.

1447
01:47:39,837 --> 01:47:42,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm there, and you can send me your vote right now.

1448
01:47:43,019 --> 01:47:44,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I only take it through private message.

1449
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't send me a private message, it don't count.

1450
01:47:46,902 --> 01:47:47,943
[SPEAKER_03]: You said right now.

1451
01:47:48,283 --> 01:47:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a whopping three minutes to vote.

1452
01:47:52,505 --> 01:47:56,286
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to throw on a quick song and then we'll tally up the votes and that'll be the end of the damn show.

1453
01:47:57,046 --> 01:48:05,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, we'll give you a request from Jamie because she's a woman and she wants to hear a woman's song.

1454
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:06,250
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's Batgirls.

1455
01:50:16,229 --> 01:50:18,131
Thank you for watching!

1456

[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1457
01:51:48,194 --> 01:51:59,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope no one discovers, I see you every day, secret hideaway, just around the way, if you're so close to me, cause, no one will ever see us, what we have to lose, our secret rendezvous.

1458
01:52:15,054 --> 01:52:27,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Linkin' with my baby, we can dance and make it Roll away the king, it's a fantasy, only you and me I want no one that's gone, and we're under common numbers What we have to lose, I'll see if I never forget

1459
01:52:41,897 --> 01:52:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join us on all the fun together.

1460
01:52:49,465 --> 01:52:55,548
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1461
01:52:55,888 --> 01:52:57,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1462
01:52:58,349 --> 01:53:02,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1463
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:07,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that was our special guest last week, Mel B, saying listen to our damn show.

1464
01:53:08,254 --> 01:53:12,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to say, because we're about at the end of the show, thank you guys very much for being here this week.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1470
01:53:21,437 --> 01:53:22,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping he'd say fuck yes.

1471
01:53:23,038 --> 01:53:25,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and, uh, fuck yes.

1472
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:26,340
Thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]: Well put.

1476
01:53:32,904 --> 01:53:35,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're not saying goodbye just yet.

1477
01:53:35,386 --> 01:53:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not saying goodbye just yet.

1478
01:53:36,206 --> 01:53:38,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure we thanked you guys for being here and coming out tonight.

1479
01:53:38,948 --> 01:53:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys think you might be back sometime soon?

1480
01:53:40,888 --> 01:53:41,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

1481
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn, yes.

1482
01:53:47,352 --> 01:53:47,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well.

1483
01:53:49,013 --> 01:53:57,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us then reveal our top three, as decided by the whole listless procedure, I don't know what the hell you want to call it, top three 2DX videos.

1484
01:53:58,599 --> 01:53:59,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1485
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:05,544
[SPEAKER_03]: In third place, drumroll please, Burning Heat.

1486
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:08,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, hooray for Burning Heat, okay.

1487
01:54:09,528 --> 01:54:10,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's give them some privilege.

1488
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:16,555
[SPEAKER_03]: In second place is the Strong Yeager.

1489
01:54:19,738 --> 01:54:26,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And in first place for the super duper bestest ever 2DX video is everybody.

1490
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:29,981
[SPEAKER_03]: is Love is Dreaminess!

1491
01:54:30,662 --> 01:54:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1492
01:54:31,562 --> 01:54:40,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, there's our winners, and, uh, oh yeah, yeah, they win, and we'll give our winner song a little victory dance here.

1493
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:41,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a minute.

1494
01:54:43,067 --> 01:54:44,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Prepare your drill.

1495
01:54:46,089 --> 01:54:49,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Get the Lego Man out, it's time to play Love is Dreaminess.

1496
01:54:50,311 --> 01:54:51,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Love is, you know, also on crack.

1497
01:54:58,110 --> 01:54:58,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is a Hallucination

1498
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a few minutes left.

1499
01:55:22,302 --> 01:55:24,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's trying to catch my attention in the chat room.

1500
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:25,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell me whatever the hell you want to say.

1501
01:55:25,905 --> 01:55:26,605
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it.

1502
01:55:26,645 --> 01:55:28,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a few more seconds here on the show.

1503
01:55:28,467 --> 01:55:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being sent a private message.

1504
01:55:29,508 --> 01:55:30,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We have as long as we want to have.

1505
01:55:30,728 --> 01:55:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's let Matt talk there.

1506
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I finally got to play that Samba de Amigo or whatever that is.

1507
01:55:36,413 --> 01:55:37,234
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is weird.

1508
01:55:37,254 --> 01:55:39,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they want you to strike poses and shit like that.

1509
01:55:39,876 --> 01:55:42,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got, you know, fucking Ricky Martin and the Macarena.

1510
01:55:43,479 --> 01:55:44,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a bad combo, man.

1511
01:55:46,543 --> 01:55:52,546
[SPEAKER_14]: You need my VMU file that has the Burning Ranger song on it and the song from Austin Powers.

1512
01:55:52,706 --> 01:55:56,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, we get a thumbs up from that.

1513
01:55:57,769 --> 01:56:00,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, the Oopa Oopa theme from Fantasy Zone.

1514
01:56:01,631 --> 01:56:02,551
[SPEAKER_14]: You ever play Fantasy Zone?

1515
01:56:04,372 --> 01:56:06,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, poor deprived person.

1516
01:56:07,714 --> 01:56:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you guys were talking about something that should be on the air.

1517
01:56:11,125 --> 01:56:11,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just about to.

1518
01:56:11,785 --> 01:56:14,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being sent one more preview song for 8th Style.

1519
01:56:14,606 --> 01:56:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Past Career, it's called.

1520
01:56:16,567 --> 01:56:20,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being sent to me so I can play it for you over the show in a minute.

1521
01:56:20,908 --> 01:56:24,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is the artist?

1522
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:26,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no clue.

1523
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:27,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is this from?

1524
01:56:27,211 --> 01:56:30,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on my list of songs in 8th Style.

1525
01:56:32,872 --> 01:56:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you gotta tell me where the hell this is from.

1526
01:56:35,413 --> 01:56:36,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who's sending it to me.

1527
01:56:37,874 --> 01:56:38,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do.

1528
01:56:38,394 --> 01:56:39,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you got it?

1529
01:56:42,078 --> 01:56:42,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a minute.

1530
01:56:43,219 --> 01:56:44,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Use both hands.

1531
01:56:45,139 --> 01:56:47,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's saying it's the 7th style theme.

1532
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:48,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it say 8th style?

1533
01:56:51,481 --> 01:56:53,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposedly the 7th style theme.

1534
01:56:53,201 --> 01:56:58,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by DJ Past.

1535
01:56:59,302 --> 01:57:01,243
[SPEAKER_14]: What about DJ Present and DJ Future?

1536
01:57:01,483 --> 01:57:03,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting angry faces for berating him over the radio.

1537
01:57:05,104 --> 01:57:06,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, it's okay.

1538
01:57:06,584 --> 01:57:07,484
[SPEAKER_14]: We still love you.

1539
01:57:08,985 --> 01:57:09,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1540
01:57:09,465 --> 01:57:09,965
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be...

1541
01:57:12,857 --> 01:57:14,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just play this, I don't know what the hell it is.

1542
01:57:14,938 --> 01:57:18,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Pantless Rage.

1543
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:23,420
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to be a little moment while we go ahead and get that up for everybody.

1544
01:57:25,221 --> 01:57:28,642
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be a whole load of crap for all I know, so we're about ready to find out.

1545
01:57:29,502 --> 01:57:31,203
[SPEAKER_03]: This could just be, this could be porno noises.

1546
01:57:31,483 --> 01:57:32,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1547
01:57:32,983 --> 01:57:33,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Pantless Rage.

1548
01:57:37,885 --> 01:57:39,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, this is a 7th style theme.

1549
01:57:39,225 --> 01:57:39,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this song.

1550
01:57:39,805 --> 01:57:40,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

1551
01:57:40,206 --> 01:57:41,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've heard this before.

1552
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:48,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, very cool.

1553
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,941
[SPEAKER_14]: This is playable on 8th style.

1554
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:51,942
[SPEAKER_14]: On 8er style.

1555
01:57:53,363 --> 01:57:53,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Aired.

1556
01:57:53,623 --> 01:57:56,705
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know.

1557
01:57:56,745 --> 01:57:58,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I can imagine this would be really difficult.

1558
01:57:58,887 --> 01:58:02,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow Perfume was the theme of 2DX 6th style, and now it's in 7th style.

1559
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:06,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we're talking about 2DX, not Beatmania, not Five Finger Gayness.

1560
01:58:06,232 --> 01:58:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I still am of the opinion that

1561
01:58:19,348 --> 01:58:21,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that should be our clip of the week.

1562
01:58:21,649 --> 01:58:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you SoCalKicks for sending me that file because if I don't say his name he'll cry.

1563
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:28,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm sorry, what?

1564
01:58:28,231 --> 01:58:29,731
[SPEAKER_14]: He was talking about five fingering.

1565
01:58:30,872 --> 01:58:31,672
[SPEAKER_14]: I still have you beat.

1566
01:58:31,732 --> 01:58:33,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I talked about the king of iron fingering.

1567
01:58:33,393 --> 01:58:35,273
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, we are going to close out the show.

1568
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:36,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to everybody for listening.

1569
01:58:36,434 --> 01:58:37,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to all the guests for being here.

1570
01:58:37,674 --> 01:58:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have any last minute thoughts?

1571
01:58:42,776 --> 01:58:47,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you're listening out there, you're like the coolest gay person I've ever met.

1572
01:58:48,803 --> 01:58:49,523
[SPEAKER_15]: So are you!

1573
01:58:49,803 --> 01:58:50,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey!

1574
01:58:50,563 --> 01:58:53,944
[SPEAKER_15]: And, okay, half the community is gay, so it don't matter.

1575
01:58:55,064 --> 01:58:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1576
01:58:55,344 --> 01:58:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Nakari's cool and all, but, you know, share the love, come on.

1577
01:59:00,025 --> 01:59:01,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it, I hate everybody.

1578
01:59:02,206 --> 01:59:03,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you the gay?

1579
01:59:05,086 --> 01:59:07,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch the movie Science, it's like the best movie I've ever seen.

1580
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:09,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome, go see it.

1581
01:59:09,227 --> 01:59:10,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't read about it, just go see it.

1582
01:59:10,847 --> 01:59:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch the Powerpuff movie, it's better.

1583
01:59:13,368 --> 01:59:13,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1584
01:59:15,575 --> 01:59:16,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everybody.

1585
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:18,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for putting up with this train wreck all night long.

1586
01:59:18,299 --> 01:59:19,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last thoughts from Jamie?

1587
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you get the final word.

1588
01:59:20,302 --> 01:59:21,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you, my head's empty.

1589
01:59:21,684 --> 01:59:22,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I drank it all out last night.

1590
01:59:24,011 --> 01:59:26,973
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1591
01:59:27,534 --> 01:59:30,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1592
01:59:31,336 --> 01:59:38,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1593
01:59:39,362 --> 01:59:43,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1594
01:59:43,565 --> 01:59:44,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Goodbye, kids.

1595
01:59:44,526 --> 01:59:50,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Today's show was brought to you by the letter, um, bong.

1596
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:53,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And the number...

1597
01:59:54,494 --> 01:59:55,675
[SPEAKER_12]: God, you're messed up.

1598
01:59:56,877 --> 01:59:57,898
[SPEAKER_12]: F*** you.

1599
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:00,420
[SPEAKER_12]: The number, f*** you.

1600
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:03,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

1601
02:00:03,904 --> 02:00:05,366
