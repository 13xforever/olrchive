00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now let me check the zip code. 2-1-2, fuck you!

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
You have no money, darling.

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Kiss my grip, bitch.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hidey ho.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Me too!

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Fucker yet?

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
On the side of my face.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Breathing.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Breath.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Heaving breath.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Heaving.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Whatever.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Duh duh duh duh duh, I am your singing telegram.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

Right now, right now

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Like my sister, my sister said

107
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
It's not as easy as you say

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Remember that phrase again

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
When I say boom, boom, boom

110
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080

And ride, ride, and ride

117
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,580
And ride, ride, and ride

118
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,600
Lean it to the left, lean it to the left

119
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Lean it to the right, lean it the right

120
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,040
Crown it down for speed, crown it down for speed

121
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
Just obey your need, just obey your need

Climb the rock, step by step

Come on, please, for old times' sake

137
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
I gotta do this every single day

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
You gotta do this every single day

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Tell you the truth, my hair's turning gray

140
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Say the truth, your hair's turning gray

141
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
You may be old, bold, and with teeth and pores

142
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
It really, really don't matter to me

143
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
You can come this far, I know you got it now

144
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Come on, let's see what we got, yes, fuck you for brown

145
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Where's the roach? Where did I put it?

146
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Where's the roach? Where did you put it?

147
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I thought you had it, I gave it to you

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I gave it to you

149
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Oh then

150
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Why don't you take it straight

151
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Oh then

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Why don't I get my skate

153
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Where's mine

154
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,480
Can you please wait

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Where's yours

156
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Can I please wait

157
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
You want to just forget it

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
You just take a picture

159
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm carrying a crown

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
for all my adventures

161
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
You're carrying a crown

162
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
for all your adventures

163
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
That was good

164
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Can you please take a picture

165
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Please take a picture!

166
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Sure!

167
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:49,000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, that was the Swedish chef there promoting

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
our little show.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,520
Yes, Swedish chef can also be found on Google.

170
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,680
We apologize for the feedback we're getting here tonight.

171
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,480
I don't know if it's because we're crammed in a little room and we've got a fan right

172
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
near us.

173
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
Maybe if we want to move the fan we might get a little less interference with what's

174
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
going on.

175
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
I don't know.

176
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
We'll work on that.

177
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
We're coding.

178
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Please pardon the hum in the background.

179
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,320
It adds character, yeah.

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Anyway, so in that last segment we had, what, Papaya with Supergirl, and I tried to play

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
Mr. T Take Me Higher, but unfortunately the damn MP3 was corrupt, so we threw in some

182
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Sister Mosesha from Parappa the Rappa Part 2.

183
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Yep.

184
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Very fun stage.

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Yes.

186
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Have you, now you wanted to say, give that as a shout-out to some people?

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Um, yes.

188
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,800
There's some people who said they'd be listening tonight, so I'd like to say hi to Mary, to

189
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Ash, Michelle, and Phil.

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
So, hi people.

191
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Yay.

192
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Does anybody else have a shout-out they'd like to give out?

193
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Over here?

194
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Shout-out!

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Yeah, so like, I hope all you conquered scrubs are listening to this, because, no!

196
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Am I even talking?

197
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes, we can hear you.

198
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Oh, crap.

199
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Okay, gotta go, bye.

200
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Is this thing on?

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Yes, it is on.

202
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Hello?

203
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Testes?

204
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Test, oh, wait.

205
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
So, we are joined in studio tonight by some special out-of-town guests.

206
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
What brings you guys here to town this weekend?

207
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
We were bored.

208
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,880
Yes, if we sound a little bit out of it tonight and very unprepared for tonight's show, there

209
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,660
is good reason for that.

210
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,960
We had a fat party last night, a really, really big party here at the house, so...

211
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
I like scotch.

212
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,560
I like double shots of scotch very much.

213
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,240
And yeah, there was a little bit of drinking, just a tiny bit.

214
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
A little.

215
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
A little.

216
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
And...

217
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,240
If you, you know, count getting completely shit-faced as a little, then yeah.

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Go ahead and keep talking, Jamie. I'm trying to filter some things out here.

219
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Oh, there's pressure! I can't take it! Don't make me talk!

220
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Um, hi!

221
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Hi!

222
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Um, seriously, the party last night was pretty, um, well, kind of insane.

223
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Um, there were a lot of people here.

224
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,240
And, uh, it was basically, there was 2DX going on in the game room.

225
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,240
And, uh, I wandered in there one time with Guitar Freaks going on.

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,240
And then there was also, you know, more drinking and quiche.

227
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
My...

228
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Forward, forward.

229
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Yeah, you have to say that in the microphone so everybody can hear you.

230
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
These don't work very well.

231
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Wait, what noise?

232
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Whatever you want.

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
We're on the air, say whatever you want.

234
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Who's listening?

235
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Everybody.

236
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Who's everybody?

237
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
People.

238
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Hi.

239
00:14:37,240 --> 00:15:02,520
The party was fun, I had lots of people walking around the sim when I was drunk, people kept

240
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,520
locking me out in the garage with my sim, all night long. Yeah, that was fun.

241
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,880
Hey, I hung out with you and I was drunk. I got to do Drunk Drunk Revolution and I really

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,800
wish that Wendell had been there because I owe him a match of Drunk Drunk Revolution

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,920
back from Fauna Bay last year. Well, we'll just have to invite him the next

244
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,440
time. Definitely.

245
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh, we have a special message from the chat room for Mike from SoCal Kicks. He says, fuck

246
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
you

247
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,280
special delivery there from our chat room if you want to join in our chat room

248
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,120
and uh... join in the uh... ever interesting festivities tonight

249
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,840
tonight will be a interesting show i guarantee because we're all hungover

250
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,480
um... but i'm not hungover

251
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,040
i'm not technically hungover i'm emotionally hungover

252
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,160
anyway

253
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You know, the saddest thing in DDR I can think of to play is like...

254
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Rain of Sorrow or Ever Snow.

255
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Or... Beauty Chaser.

256
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I could play like, how about Ballad for You?

257
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Ah!

258
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Do not ever play...

259
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,160
There is one of the other songs that will never show up on our playlist.

260
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Never.

261
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I agree.

262
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
That was punctuated with a lovely noise.

263
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,720
Now the room smells like burp.

264
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,560
They're saying about the party saying, uh, Sky was stripped of his virginity about four

265
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
years ago, bub.

266
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Not last night.

267
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't we normally, uh, pass that on the way to the Bay Area?

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,120
Shut up!

269
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,520
We need, like, this is a Bahmani-related show.

270
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
A Bee-mani show.

271
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,440
Talking about Konami's famous Bee-mani series.

272
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,440
I don't say the word BEE-monnie right on this show, according to some people.

273
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,280
Explain this little getup you've got, Dave. I know this isn't television, so I'll explain

274
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,880
this for you. Dave's like wearing a lampshade, and he's fanning himself with one of those

275
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,440
prizes that you obviously get with tickets over at Golf Land or something.

276
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,640
We need to start playing Star Mine for a minute now.

277
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,280
I don't know. Yeah, he looks like Tran from Star Mine. Or when he's double fanning himself,

278
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,280
So I'm thinking Katana from Mortal Kombat here, just wearing the fatality.

279
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Tell us about this outfit here.

280
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Okay, well, I was playing Speed Demon, and for any of you who don't know what that game is,

281
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,280
it's the most ridiculously easy way to win free tickets.

282
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,280
So I played it, and I spent about $2 and won 500 tickets.

283
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,320
and then so me and my friend like ooh what's a hat thing so it opened up this big kind of lampshade

284
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,320
it looks like a wicker lampshade yeah except that it's not completely round it looks like a tiffany

285
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,640
lamp but without any glass yeah and it's not that great but anyway it's kind of cool and for 150

286
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,280
tickets i bought zoom so i had 200 tickets left and then i saw the fans which are made of crap

287
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,600
They're pretty little birds.

288
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,520
Crafts with colors on them.

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,720
So I took eight of them.

290
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,440
And then they gave me two extras because they're nice.

291
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
I've got a harmonica.

292
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
And so now I put it on, and I walk around

293
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,920
and make cool of myself.

294
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
I thought you did that anyway.

295
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,760
Yes, but now I can stay cool while doing it.

296
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
Literally.

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,040
That's what I call an intelligent, ridiculous looking

298
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,720
fashion sense.

299
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,240
I wish I had the webcam stuff working, but I don't.

300
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,320
I'm still working on that.

301
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
I'll hopefully have that up soon.

302
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
Of course, I said that two weeks ago, so who knows?

303
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,960
That's soon in Rob's universe, by the way.

304
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Yes.

305
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,640
If you want to join our chat room, visit any other side IRC server like IRC.Acheheads.org

306
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,280
and join channel Orange Lounge and you can talk to us and participate live with the show.

307
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Remember, that's Orange Lounge, not red or purple.

308
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,920
the band from 2DX where we stole the name, basically, yeah. Anyway, let's talk to our

309
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,300
guests. Let's talk to our guests here. Hi, guests. Do you guys have anything that you're

310
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,440
here to plug tonight? Because usually when guests come on shows, they're here to plug

311
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,440
something like their latest album or a TV show or a movie they're going to be in. Do

312
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,100
you guys have anything, tournaments or special appearances you're going to be making or websites

313
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,400
or what? No. You're just here for the fuck of it, huh? Yes. You're just here to say,

314
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I was on Orange Lounge. I destroyed Orange Lounge. Bingo!

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
He's here to watch anime porn with all of us.

316
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Yes. What was the coolest line?

317
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Oh, my baby! Not inside of me! I don't want to be

318
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
pregnant! Not my baby!

319
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, that one part where he's fantasizing about the chick

320
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and then he sees the guy sucking his dick. Oops.

321
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Hint's the warning for adult content.

322
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Yeah, sorry about that.

323
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
How about you, Jazz? Anything you want to promote?

324
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Go Stas Squad!

325
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Yes, go Stas Squad. Thank you.

326
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Go Dave Squad!

327
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Team SAC making an appearance at the teaser.

328
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Why did I grab the mic?

329
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,080
Cuz you are an attention whore.

330
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
I grab the mic all the time.

331
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
He's right next to me.

332
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I have Rob's mic!

333
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Ahh!

334
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
It's a big grab.

335
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
I can already tell where this show is going.

336
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
You know, maybe I ought to take the suggestion and just end the show when The Simpsons come

337
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,880
on and we'll just fuck the show, let's watch The Simpsons.

338
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
No.

339
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
You can't, we can't do that.

340
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
We're dedicated.

341
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
But we're on the radio.

342
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,220
Okay, well if we actually want to do some important stuff I can go over what new sim

343
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,960
information out there. Okay, well to begin, we've got a DDRMania X finally back up, still

344
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:11,580
waiting on the melting pot in DWI, at least there's new mirrors for that. DWI, I guess

345
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:18,100
version 2.0 beta 5 is finally out now. Unfortunately, because I did play with the sim last night,

346
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,460
I have 976 songs in there now. The problem is you can't configure any of the keyboard

347
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,040
or joystick options in there, so basically I was stuck without being able to use my pads

348
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,900
on it, which really disappointed me, and the movies still don't work on them. Um, Step

349
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,480
Mania 5 is supposed to be out pretty soon, or at least Beta 5 for that, so, you know,

350
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,080
hopefully soon, because it said on, uh, DDR Maniacs that it was already out, but I haven't

351
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,620
seen it, and still waiting for that. Um, other than that, you know, Turning Mix 2 is still

352
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,640
on for August, you know, so entering that, you'll see all the new songs come up around

353
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,100
August 15th on DDR East Coast Invasion, so watch for that I guess.

354
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
Do we still have time to enter that?

355
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,060
Uh, yes we do.

356
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,380
Anytime, well this time around I will be entering, I've already picked which song I'll be doing,

357
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,380
which will be Outer Limits, so look for that to be coming probably on August 15th.

358
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,380
Rad.

359
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,380
I would like to make a shout out to Ash who just entered the room.

360
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I'm glad that you made it into the chat room. Enjoy IRC.

361
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:36,380
Now one errand that you guys were running today, kind of speaking about the PC simulations, you guys were running over to Fry's to pick up a copy of Dan's Dance Revolution for the PC.

362
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Yes we did.

363
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
And you haven't even gotten to try it out yet.

364
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:51,380
No, I made a copy for myself and then I didn't quite get a chance to. I'll play it on one of the breaks and I'll be back with my brief review of it.

365
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Okay, so during one of the breaks you can go run out there and install it and give us a review.

366
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,380
Oh, it's already installed. I just gotta go play it.

367
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Oh, okay. We'll do that during one of the breaks.

368
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,380
So we'll talk a little bit more about DDR for the PC later.

369
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,380
What else in news is going on in the Bimani world?

370
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:15,380
I know, you guys were at that tournament that just happened over the weekend, well not over the weekend, it was during the week, the Triple Threat, what did you guys think about that?

371
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,380
Or you weren't there Justin? No, just Mike? What did you think of the Triple Threat contest? Give us a little summary.

372
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:26,380
Okay, yeah, for one thing, Mike Noah should know that he should never have a tournament on Thursday and Friday.

373
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:35,380
But he already knows that from the bitching that people have done, including Slip and Meow and all the other fucking flamers out there.

374
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,380
I wanted to go to that and I couldn't because it was on the weekday.

375
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:12,300
Cool, but some of the things I didn't want to see, like zero stripping in front of Emphasis

376
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:20,260
or Mr. Windle almost eating Emphasis too, which was not a good thing to see.

377
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,940
I feel sorry for Emphasis, yes, as we all do.

378
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:35,260
Gee, anyway, um, yeah, like, Corey, he was bitching again.

379
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Because he lost. But yeah, he has to get over it and deal with his loss, just like every other P.A.'er.

380
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
Who won?

381
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:50,260
For Royal Rumble, Eugene won. I give him props for that, because he always practices a lot.

382
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,260
How many people did he conquer to win that?

383
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Well, he was the 16th person to go up. He took out his brother Ree, I believe? I'm not sure.

384
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,260
And then he just lasted after that all the way up to the 28th person.

385
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,260
And then, emphasis, he got to come back again because he had tokens.

386
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Because every time you beat three people, or so many people, you gain an extra so-called life.

387
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,260
So you can make a comeback.

388
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:30,260
But Jimmy lost to him on Kakame, which sucked because he'd always practiced that song a lot.

389
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:43,260
The arch madness, surprisingly, Rii won, beating Eugene by two greats on Wakalaka, hidden right on flat, I believe, which was pretty good.

390
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,260
It's scary. Yes, very scary.

391
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Um, Survivor Series, I talked too much shit, I thought my team was gonna win, but got knocked out first round.

392
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:01,260
It was really close. I took out Ree, which is a good accomplishment, because he always beats me at tournaments.

393
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Yes! Thank you all! Thank you all!

394
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Anyway, yeah, um, a lot of people came. It was a good tournament. Hope to look forward to another one like that. Just make sure it's on a weekend.

395
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:23,260
As you all know, on the 17th, Dark Sound's tournament is going to be at Mountain Mike's in Concord.

396
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Hopefully all of you will come to that. It should be pretty fun, entertaining, like the last tournament he had.

397
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:39,260
I like the fourth bracket. This wasted two minutes of my life and I want it back for freestyle.

398
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,540
That would so be my category if I ever actually entered freestyle.

399
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,580
Did you get a chance to see my drunken freestyle last night?

400
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,820
On Loki's sim I was dancing, he has a speedway in his sim with steps to it.

401
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,780
I didn't see it, however I think that might be an excuse to revive the bats.

402
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
You know, I think, you know what we ought to do?

403
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,780
Let's go to this tournament and just get fucking wasted and do a freestyle routine and see

404
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
how we do.

405
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,980
Which for me, but damn it, if I'm going to freestyle is either going to be with bats

406
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
or pom poms.

407
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,980
It's acceptable. If other people drive us, it's cool. We're going to order a picture of beer at Mt. Mike's.

408
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Well, I don't know if it would be against the rules if we could do the freestyle with the picture of beer.

409
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
I wouldn't want to spill my beer.

410
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,980
First off, that's alcohol abuse. Second of all, that's a dance pad that we can't get wet.

411
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,980
You know, at least from non-organic, well, I guess it is organic.

412
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,980
You know, it's bad enough we might get so drunk to the point of accidentally urinating on the pads.

413
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,980
No. No. I may throw up, but I never pee on the pad.

414
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Rob, shut up!

415
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,980
I'm just thinking of the sound clips I'm going to get from this show.

416
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,980
You are not using that! You are not.

417
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,980
I never pee on the dance pad. Thank you.

418
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Anyway. Oh, other news. Let's talk about...

419
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,980
Yes, other news.

420
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:16,500
Let's talk about 8th Style, 2DX 8th Style, we've got some demo MP3s from 8rd Style because

421
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,640
it's on test location right now and so we're going to play some clips from some of the

422
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,620
new songs and we'll get, now has anybody else here heard these 8th Style songs?

423
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,380
You've heard, assume you haven't, we'll see what you guys think of them.

424
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I'll play some quick clips. I'm not going to play the whole thing, because they're kind of long, so we'll just kind of skip to the middle and see what we get.

425
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,380
This first song I'm going to play is Airflow by Mr. T.

426
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,380
It kind of sounds a little bit like Burning Heat.

427
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,380
It sounds like Right on the Light.

428
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Sounds like it's got a little bit of the burning heat-ish in there, because it's kind of got those...

429
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Mr. T didn't do burning heat.

430
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Didn't he?

431
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
No, that was Naoki.

432
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
Mr. T?

433
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
That was a tribute to Mr. T.

434
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Ah!

435
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
It wasn't Mr. T.

436
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Ah, okay, I see.

437
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
I'm confused now.

438
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,380
I thought it was Mr. T and Motokai F or whatever.

439
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Huh, I could be wrong.

440
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,380
I thought Naoki did burning heat.

441
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,380
Mm-hmm.

442
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
No, I know it wasn't Naoki.

443
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,380
Anyway, speaking of Naoki, let's see how this one is.

444
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,380
This is a song and it's called The Blue Impulse, and this features Yuki.

445
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:50,380
Hooray, I'm happy he finally ditched Paul Terri.

446
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,380
Yay! Well, you know, that's probably just your other, it's their pet name, you know.

447
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,380
If Brad was here, he would smack you right now.

448
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Yeah, well, he's not. That's his own damn fault for not showing up.

449
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
So, fuck Paul Terry!

450
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
And fuck Brad!

451
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Yeah!

452
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Anyway.

453
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Right in the nose!

454
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,380
I hope he's not listening at home. Anyway.

455
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Hi, hi, Brad.

456
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,380
Because I'll be in, I'll be in trouble if that wasn't.

457
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,380
Let's look at DJ Taka doing Rainbow Flyer.

458
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Yeah, it sounds like I sense a lot of those little like triplet things that you see a lot in 2DX.

459
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,880
The VX is like da da da da da da da da da da da da.

460
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Yeah, you have to remember these MP3s are going to be crappy because people are recording them off the machine literally.

461
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Don't the machines have audio in out? Why can't they just use that?

462
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Well, because the people who own the arcade or testing the machine might be kind of watching for the evil eye.

463
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,880
We have, like, Konami representatives around the bit, like, uh, what are you doing?

464
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,880
So, you know, save the game at given time, because that's what they did, you know, with Max 2 and that kind of thing.

465
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
So, just give it time.

466
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Somebody will leak this soundtrack eventually.

467
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
And the last one here, now this falls into a category called Cuddlecore, which I'm sure to be interesting.

468
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Sounds good to me.

469
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,880
This is the Munmer Twins.

470
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,880
I'm sorry, the song is called Munmer Twins, and it's by Yuu Tokiwa.

471
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,880
And this is, I hear this is really, really bad quality, so I apologize if it sucks, but we're going to try it anyway.

472
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
It sounds kind of mellow.

473
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I know you hear all the conversation.

474
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
Does it get interesting by the end?

475
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:18,260
I think that's what we do, is we ruin the games.

476
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,600
We love them so much, we ruin them.

477
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,600
You heard it first, on Orange Lounge.

478
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I'm saying in the chatroom, I farted better quality sounds than this in response to the Cuddlecore song.

479
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,600
That was from Iron Man.

480
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,600
That would be an interesting 2DX song, kind of like in the kitty. You remember the kitty song?

481
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,600
The theme of OOPPA!

482
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,520
That song was very interesting.

483
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,480
It made it onto Beatmania Pocket for Wonderswan.

484
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,820
That actually is a really good version of Beatmania.

485
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,320
If you have to have it with you and you have a Wonderswan.

486
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,040
It came with a little scratch pad that hooks over to the right side of the system.

487
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,160
And all of the music, it only had ten songs in it, but they were all digitized.

488
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,040
She didn't get, you know, crappy MIDI like with the DDRGB series.

489
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,840
But it had theme of hookah on it, so that's why I said that.

490
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,800
And of course also still popular in the 2DX world, 6 style for the home.

491
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,680
Still pretty much new, and lots of people getting that, and more and more people playing

492
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
it.

493
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,680
The Game Boy versions of the Bumani games, you can actually get those at BumaniStyle.com.

494
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Hey, hey, hey!

495
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
They've got them there.

496
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
Free plug!

497
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Yeah, free plug.

498
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Or you can do what I did and go buy them.

499
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
There's the right way and the wrong way.

500
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,680
You know, that's like so 2,000.

501
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
You know what?

502
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I have it on my Game Boy and I can take it with me whereas I can't take my whole computer with me.

503
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
My bio is a little heavy, thank you.

504
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,840
and it won't fit into my purse.

505
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,560
OK, we're going to go to a quick break here,

506
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,000
and we're going to test out DDRPC.

507
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
Some people are running out to go play that,

508
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,960
because we just got it here, a copy of In the House.

509
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
And we're going to take a quick break,

510
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,520
and we'll come back with our initial thoughts on DDRPC.

511
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,240
Some interesting news involving DDRPC

512
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,440
that could be an indication of where US Balmani is headed.

513
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,200
And also tonight, we've got FU the Week,

514
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,760
pretty lengthy this week and we also are doing another additional list list tonight so stay

515
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
tuned for that.

516
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,760
we'll be right back

517
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:22,840
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum Yum, yum, baby, McLaren

518
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:31,200
Bye, bye, baby, bias I'm I'm one

519
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,640
polis

520
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,960
Bitch, get a new song.

521
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,280
An open letter from orange lounge radio.

522
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,160
I think that was like the very first promo that I ever made for the station, I'm not

523
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
sure.

524
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,460
I remember coming up with that in your car, you did.

525
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,040
The One-Hit Wonder One?

526
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,400
No, not the One-Hit Wonder One, I'm talking about the Jogo one, because we were listening

527
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
to one of your Dance Mania compilations.

528
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
That's right.

529
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
It was playing Bye-Bye Baby.

530
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,160
That wasn't nice, Jogo was cool.

531
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,120
But she needs a new song, I mean, let's face it, they're all the same.

532
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,740
The song was playing and I was in the back seat singing Dom Dariyam.

533
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,200
And that's like how Matt, who's out in the garage right now with DDRPC, playing, he has

534
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,280
an edit for Bye Bye Baby Balloon that's basically just the steps to Dom Dariyam, and it works

535
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
for like the first half of the song, but then it kind of gets out of sync, like there's

536
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,620
an extra beat or something that throws it all off, but it works scary well.

537
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,800
So as I mentioned, they're out in the garage right now playing DDRPC.

538
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Are you sure they're not watching the anime porn again?

539
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,240
could be by this point as soon as I left, but when I went out there they were watching

540
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:50,240
the DRPC. A whole new interface, which I've got to say is weird. I mean, it's kind of

541
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:58,080
like fourth mix. But not. But not. How do I explain this? Okay, imagine if on fourth

542
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,120
mix you could go down to any category you want. You could select any category you want

543
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,760
and then that list below with all the songs would change as you move, like you could also

544
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,960
move up and down as opposed to left and right and change the categories basically, except

545
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,200
instead of kind of being in a line, all the songs are in this little spinning circle thing

546
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
which is kind of odd.

547
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,280
And if you press right, it goes to the next song, it spins like ch-ch-ch, kind of cool.

548
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I like it.

549
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,800
Now one thing I noticed right away, the characters are based off some kind of new engine because

550
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,580
they're really high resolution, they look really good, the characters, which is probably

551
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:37,340
why the new hidden characters is such a big deal. Which is one of the big news that came

552
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,720
up this week is that there's now, they've released the very first downloadable characters

553
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,940
for DDR PC. I believe Zach and Alex are the names. And they're not based off any other

554
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:54,460
previous DDR characters, they're brand spanking new. Yay for America. Yay, we get something

555
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:01,460
Special. We get an Earthlight mix and an AM3P mix and now we get Pallet Zack.

556
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,460
That makes me smell a patron of crime. I'm feeling it in the cockles of my heart.

557
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,460
Basically the game is mostly based off a fourth mix engine, although it is a little smoother.

558
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,460
I'd say it's a lot, the arrows seem to run a little smoother, kind of like fifth mix smooth.

559
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
I was going to look and they turned it off.

560
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,240
of them you didn't get to see the interface thing it's well I mean again

561
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,940
since it's based off a fourth mix engine it it looks very similar except you kind

562
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,820
of could just pick any category you want and then the songs are in a circle as

563
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:39,540
opposed to across the bottom kind of interesting huh yes circles are good

564
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,020
and then I'm also I'm also being told not to forget Angel Zukin as opposed to

565
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:54,020
Why can't we have purgatorial zukin or something? Where it's just kind of boring and just stands there.

566
00:43:54,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Japs got zukin. Since there's like two players, can't they like thin down shit on their face and everything?

567
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:13,020
and yell out in all right

568
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,100
so this is how it will be how about topless how about topless

569
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
kid

570
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,960
they should have like boys again

571
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,660
advocating how long do you think was a bounce

572
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,700
or

573
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,540
in the chat room they're hoping for shirtless emi

574
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,420
you know

575
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,420
Did I get pantsless rage?

576
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
How long do you think it's going to take?

577
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,420
Do you think he's going to bounce?

578
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:53,420
If somebody went and hacked Tomb Raider so that you could play a nude Lara Croft with big ol' jugs and you know

579
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:59,420
How long is it going to take before somebody hacks DDRPC so you can play Top Lezukan shirtless enemy pantsless rage?

580
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,420
So what, then merge the first dead or alive with DDR and have like bounce, bounce, revolution?

581
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,420
You know, bounce with me, bounce.

582
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,420
Since now you can play DDR at home in the nude, play along with our characters in the nude!

583
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,420
You know, I bet they're gonna have skins you can make for that, though. That would be awesome.

584
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
New skins.

585
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,420
Ooh, baby. You know, it's gonna turn into this whole big, you know, fad like what happened with The Sims.

586
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:34,180
Sims you know where you can have you know Wolverine and somebody random like

587
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:40,660
I don't know Galactica's you know hanging out doing husband wifey things

588
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,260
we have the return a very observant fellow in the chat room says you could

589
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,780
says now I can't confirm this maybe Jamie can but you can see rages ball

590
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:58,780
line and third mix. You know, I never bothered to check, but maybe I will. I was pyro man

591
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:07,780
this event. You're a moron. So we have nuts in DDR. Let's just not talk about people to

592
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,980
play. Oh wait, Matt's back joining us. What were your first impressions of DDRPC being

593
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,340
a sim fan? Okay, let's start with the interface. What the hell were they thinking? It's fourth

594
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,900
mix but is the most retarded earphones I've ever seen okay but I'll give it a

595
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,300
little credit because fourth mix needed that where you can go back and forth

596
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,700
between the categories it just it looks kind of dumb I mean but the idea is good

597
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,940
it just okay it's like if you took the banners from fourth mix is sucking on

598
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,660
the little CD rotation thing they have an all music mode you would get what you

599
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,260
have there which looks like a bunch of banners hanging from a spindle thing

600
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,340
like some sort of like sunglass case type thing that you would see in a store

601
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,800
is the most fucking retarded thing and they only have like eight songs in each

602
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,600
thing so even if it was like fourth mix which you've got to admit has about like

603
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,760
at least 20 or so in each category I mean why the hell are they doing that

604
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,600
with the interface it just looks like crap so that's fine you know it looks

605
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,920
like crap the textures as far as the characters go really good looks nice and

606
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,760
yeah the characters look nice those first thing I said to backgrounds who

607
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,760
really cared no one watches the backgrounds, but they look nice too.

608
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Did you see any LEGO people yet?

609
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
That's the best backgrounds, LEGO people.

610
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,760
Well, no, I didn't, but what I did like though is the fact that you can customize with buttons and stuff

611
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,760
for the controllers and that kind of thing, because the way I have my pads wired, they're really fucked up, so

612
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,760
you know, if it was set to how a pad was, it wouldn't work, so

613
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,760
I'm glad they have that at least.

614
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,280
Meanwhile, we have Mario with a yo-yo stuck in his eye.

615
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,760
Hyroman sent me a picture, shall we take a vote on whether to open it or not?

616
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,320
It is entitled Rage.gif, so you can bet you know what it is.

617
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Balls!

618
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,160
Alright, so we all vote yes, we're going to open it, that's what I'm going to do with

619
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,320
these files sent to me during the show, now we're just going to vote if we're going to

620
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,680
waste our time with it or not.

621
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,640
Alright, we voted to waste our time with it, here we go.

622
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,320
It's just a picture of Rage, I mean...

623
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
He's got a shadow between his legs.

624
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Is that supposed to be that the shadowing there is supposed to be, like, balls?

625
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
Unless he's got some really huge testicles.

626
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,320
You know what, for his fat legs.

627
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Is that supposed to be the peenie right there?

628
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,320
If so, that's not impressive.

629
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Alright.

630
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
I expected better from Rage.

631
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,320
But keep in mind, you know, Rage goes everywhere.

632
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Well, maybe that's why he's called Rach. He's, you know, he's very angry over the fact he has a small penis. I mean, I've never, I've never thought about that.

633
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,320
Hooray, this show's resorted to dick jokes. Yay!

634
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Oh, no, no, it's like that one, that one joke where it goes, um, it goes in to get laid at a brothel.

635
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
Wait, wait, wait, you know what?

636
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

637
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:06,320
I think it's doctored, I don't know, because...

638
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,560
I don't know though, maybe not, because the shadowing looks right, I mean I guess it's

639
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,560
a real thing.

640
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:17,640
You know, Robby, you're trying to look like a woman there.

641
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,120
So Rage has a vagina, chicks with dicks.

642
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,400
So basically the backstory on Rage could make it in the porn industry because of one small

643
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,280
defect, so he's turned to DDR to fan out his frustrations.

644
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,760
No, it's like the joke of the man who went into the raffle.

645
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,520
He goes in and this one woman comes running out of the room laughing hysterically, so

646
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,720
his dicks had tiny on it.

647
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,680
And so another one goes in, and she comes running out screaming, I can't do it!

648
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,400
His dicks has tiny on it!

649
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,740
So another one goes in, and she actually has a little bit more patience.

650
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,220
She comes out hours later, and the other goes, so you could do it?

651
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,220
How could you do it?

652
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:05,380
He's like, once you got that thing going, it said Tiny's Bar and Grill, 5734 5th Street,

653
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,380
New York, New York.

654
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:19,780
That old joke, I know, but that's why he has the rage, because nobody will give him a chance.

655
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,860
That sucked.

656
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,220
Now there's talk in the chat room and if you want to join our insane people in the chat

657
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,340
room you're just going to head over to any other side IRC server like IRC.eggheads.org

658
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,540
and you're going to join channel pound orange lounge and they're talking right now they're

659
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:41,060
wondering if um well they've got one more dick joke there if afro's hung like a horse

660
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,620
they're going to look into that maybe get some more pictures in the contest with dread

661
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:50,260
snake i think dread snake has a beat the name says i don't know man you've got those robots

662
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,080
in there too I mean who knows of that kind of stuff I mean really anything's

663
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,980
possible there they have all those attachments don't they and now we've

664
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,500
really really gone into the adult content so I think maybe we need to be

665
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,420
people no no break we're gonna talk character now you people need to get out

666
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,860
of the gutter because you're all stepping on me so go away now these new

667
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:25,860
new characters are going to be coming out? No. Jamie's thinking about Dick. They're coming

668
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:33,380
out. So what kind of characters do you think we'll be seeing with these new Konami originals?

669
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:40,800
One thing I suggested on a post like this in DDR Freak, of all places, was that Konami

670
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,440
seems like the type that would have a little bit of humor and probably put a dancing Solid

671
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,840
Snake in the game. Like as the very last character would be like Solid Snake and like maybe Krita

672
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,800
in there. You know what's pretty cool? I'm sorry I have one suggestion. You know Naoki's

673
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,760
in DDR? They should put Mr. T in there and have a look at Mr. T. He's like, I pity the

674
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,760
The K-O-A guy getting fired or something?

675
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,760
No, Pikachu is a Nintendo character, I don't think it's going to show up.

676
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
Pikachu needs to die.

677
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
They need to get those guys from Contra in there.

678
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Oh yeah.

679
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,760
See, I have this secret little plan that I'm going to take over...

680
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Well, that's right, there was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

681
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,760
That would be awesome to have the turtles dancing at the scene.

682
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Have Splinter dancing.

683
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,760
But no, I have this plot going on that when I go to Tokyo next year,

684
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,760
I'm going to take over Toei and have the rights to Digimon be my own,

685
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,880
will have Digimon and DDR because I'm also going to take over Konami next with a tank.

686
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,960
Well we do know that the last unlockable character is going to have to be something very interesting

687
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,640
because most of them have a partner, but the very last one is Solo.

688
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Kid Dracula.

689
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,700
So, I'm being told that anything is possible and things that you might be thinking are

690
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,360
rumors very well could be true, that's all I can say.

691
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,360
This could be the guy from the Mike's Hard Lemonade commercial with the crazy head growing out of his shoulder.

692
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,360
See, he's got his twin, but it's only one person. That's what it is.

693
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,360
I'm telling you, man. I've heard inside information, okay?

694
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,360
What about, like, three-titted Emmy?

695
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,360
I think this, though, would make a... honestly, Rob...

696
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,360
I think this would make a good future list list, honestly.

697
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Or they'll have, like, sex slave Zukin in there.

698
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,360
No sex slave Zukin. We need no pants rage.

699
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
Bondage Alice.

700
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,360
Guys! No, no, no, no.

701
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,360
It looks like you can have Bondage Alice and three tent Emmy that I get.

702
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,360
You know, no pants rage.

703
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Well then you gotta have, you know, a dread guy eating dreads everywhere.

704
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Yeah, okay, anyway.

705
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Cousin bit with dreads.

706
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,360
Oh, now that's a good suggestion I'm reading in the chat room.

707
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,660
that the last character should be a moe head, or Maui, I can't even say that word, like

708
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,660
from a...

709
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,660
Oh, the moe head!

710
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,660
The moe, thank you.

711
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,660
The Easter Island heads that you see in...

712
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,500
But they would get sued by Emotion.

713
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Oh.

714
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Yeah.

715
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,060
There's joint ownage laws there, apparently?

716
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,180
No, Emotion, for long-term Otomy fans, Emotion uses the moe head as their mascot.

717
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,940
What about getting sued from Easter Island, okay?

718
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:51,740
They had the moe head long before, you know, Emotion ever came out with it.

719
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,740
I'll stop now.

720
00:54:52,740 --> 00:55:01,180
Talking about that old school emotion intro with the little 80s drum rock.

721
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,020
A lovely suggestion from the chat room.

722
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,900
How about Dark Sakura dressed up as Emi?

723
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,900
As an unlockable character.

724
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,900
I've already done that.

725
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,900
But as an unlockable DVR character.

726
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Oh wait, not me.

727
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,900
Okay.

728
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,060
Do you want to go model for the lovely folks at Konami?

729
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:19,340
Okay, the pictures from Fana Mae are still up on my FTP, but no, if anybody actually

730
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,460
wants to see, I can draw it.

731
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,460
I have before.

732
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Go!

733
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
Maybe we'll make that for the site.

734
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,100
We need to put Happy Noodle Boy as the last unlockable character.

735
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,980
Happy Noodle Boy?

736
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Happy Noodle Boy.

737
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,980
Please elaborate.

738
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,860
He's a stick figure who spouts off randomness.

739
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,860
It's great.

740
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,660
He's a John and Vasquez character.

741
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,620
You know, just as long as you know people don't go nuts and make like, Mega Tokyo, you

742
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,660
know, skins for-

743
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,300
You can have Godzilla as the last character.

744
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,300
Go Godzilla Go!

745
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,220
Yeah, but like, on the serious side, I'm thinking that they might do, uh, just another artist,

746
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:01,500
like how they did on Fifth Mix with Naoki and, uh, Two Megabyte.

747
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,900
I was thinking Togo and Senna.

748
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
Or Taka.

749
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,900
But then if you use the both of them, you have Outface.

750
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,060
The one-handed V another guy.

751
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,060
Lee Su!

752
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,060
Lee Su!

753
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,060
We need DJ Lee Su.

754
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,740
Just a giant dancing hand.

755
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:23,740
No, then they'd get sued by Nintendo for the end of Smash Brothers.

756
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,740
With a giant hand that, you know, pokes you and flips you off the edge of the world.

757
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:37,740
Well, actually, you know, the game Hand of Fate, one of the Cryo India games, had a giant hand as the villain, so they could be sued by them, too.

758
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:46,740
Now, Matt, I asked your expert quote-unquote opinion, at least probably being the most educated on all the hacking of various DDR-related things in the room,

759
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:55,740
How long is it going to be before we get people creating their own DDR characters you think, such as Three Titted Emi?

760
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,740
Well, you know, that all depends on how they're in there.

761
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:08,740
As far as the music and stuff, it looks like it's pretty much similar to DDR. It's just one huge bin file that's in there.

762
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,740
I'm going to look at it and see what I can figure out.

763
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,740
I'm not that great as far as hacking actual programs and stuff.

764
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,740
I'm good with edits, that's about it.

765
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,740
But I'll figure out some, maybe.

766
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,740
You know what?

767
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:30,740
I will pay someone to make me a Dark Sakura as a skin for the DDRPC once I get mine.

768
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,740
What about Pantsless Rage?

769
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,740
I'm more important, thank you.

770
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Give me your card.

771
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,740
I give Pantsless Rage!

772
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:53,740
Well, actually, now that I think about it, since you do have the add-on characters now, it might be a little bit easier to make these extra characters, because you can look at that and see what's all entailed. I definitely see it possible, so we'll, I guess, have to wait for that.

773
00:57:53,740 --> 00:58:03,740
I'm serious, I'll pay you a whole 50 cents. Oh, wait, those are golf land tokens, my bad. But they weren't getting any golf land. That's half the game of DDR.

774
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,740
Oh, SoCalCakes is going to send that to you. He's volunteering to create that.

775
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:15,740
Okay. And, by the way, he still needs to send me proof that he, you know, got a 90% full combo on my Look to the Sky edit.

776
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:29,740
Other rumors about DDRPC is that not only will you have the downloadable characters, but you're going to be able to download new interfaces and possibly some new songs.

777
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:34,740
What do you think? Is that, for DDRBC, you think that's a possibility or you think it's a load of crap?

778
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,740
That's a load of crap.

779
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,740
I say it's a possibility and it will make it a lot better.

780
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,740
But it's a load of crap.

781
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,740
Why?

782
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:51,740
Why, I mean, why give away a license, you know, they're gonna have to take the money to, you know, license songs and stuff, or I guess they could do new Konami originals.

783
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,740
The song list though right now is all Konami originals.

784
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:59,740
Okay, fine. They can throw in more Konami Originals, I guess, at no cost, and then have those for download. So I guess that's feasible.

785
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:10,740
But really, why would they do that? I mean, they've already put the money into it. They'll probably just make another version with slightly more songs, more Konami Originals, same interface, yada yada yada.

786
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,740
I foresee it happen.

787
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,980
and then they're gonna have like the downloadable feature that'll like you

788
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,300
know

789
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,460
on it'll allow you to on stone parliament form

790
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,060
link link in my anyway

791
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,540
I'm nodding but none of you can hear it because the marbles in my head fell out

792
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,260
last night

793
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:36,820
party as I think what many of us lost our marbles today on the show

794
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,780
that's okay I'm

795
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,780
What else can we talk about DDRPC? There's something else I want to ask about it.

796
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,780
They make it frisbee, too.

797
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,780
Well, the slightly pointless edit mode, I don't know.

798
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,780
And DDRPC, though.

799
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,780
I've used the edit mode in DDRPC and all the edits come out perfectly fine.

800
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,780
Unlike economics, where at the end they all tend to get really, really messed up.

801
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:08,780
Dropout. Dropout. Dropout edit when you make an edit to that.

802
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,780
Actually, you know what? I've looked into that because I've done this whole edit hacking thing.

803
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:22,780
It may look like that there's more arrows at the end there, but actually they don't get saved to the new file.

804
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:29,780
I actually have a whole section in my FAQ that you can find at www.geocities.com

805
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:44,300
I

806
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,700
personally don't feel there's gonna be downloadable interfaces and songs because why do that when

807
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:55,700
and they can release DDRPC Second Mix Max Ultra 2000 3-Titted Emmy version.

808
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:02,700
We do not need 3-Titted Emmy version. Thank you. We need no pants range.

809
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:08,700
Well, you know they do have all these weird games that come out. Like there's that Matt Hoffman's BMX.

810
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,700
They're actually making like a sort of adult version of that. I'm dead serious.

811
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:26,700
Are you serious? They are making, what was it, Matt Hoffman's Triple Extreme. I'm serious. I've seen actual articles and I've seen pictures from it. It's like they're going to have topless writers and stuff like that.

812
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,700
You think?

813
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Guys?

814
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,700
No, women, of course.

815
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,700
Damn.

816
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,700
What's going on PlayStation 2?

817
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,880
You have to explain the reference to those, you don't know.

818
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,760
Dead or Alive Volleyball.

819
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,560
All the bouncing you can handle.

820
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:16,640
You know, if anyone is an old school importer like I am, you might remember a couple of

821
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,080
games they put out called Konami World, which were basically different adventure games.

822
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,640
They were a little platform game that had, each level was taken from various popular

823
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:34,640
There was a Dracula, a kumajou Dracula 3, there was, or for Castlevania, for U-Uninformed.

824
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,640
Gradius, Y-Force, there was all that.

825
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:45,440
If they did something like that, now it'd be like the DDR mini-game within Tokimeki

826
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,040
Memorial, Dancing Summer Vacation, and they would have the pop and music mini-game, the

827
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,040
2DX mini-games.

828
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,360
They'd be switching out controllers the whole time.

829
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,360
Now, I think the absolute coolest character add-on that they could do if they're going to do it.

830
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,360
Absolute...

831
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,360
Shut up!

832
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:11,360
Anyway, the most cool, I don't know, anyway, characters you could download would be Goemon and the doctor, uh, what's his name, with the blue mustache. Remember? Legend of Mystical Ninja?

833
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,360
And who actually played that?

834
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,360
Me?

835
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,360
I didn't play it.

836
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,360
You didn't play it?

837
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
I knew who Goemon was.

838
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,360
I sure, I would be sure of all people you would have played it.

839
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,360
I rented it once.

840
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:27,360
Because they have the little mini-Grattias you can play. If there was a new version coming out, it would have a mini-DDR, I guarantee you.

841
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:37,360
You know, that would actually make sense. But we've already had DDR as a minigame for, like I said, dancing, summer vacation, for all of you dating sim fans.

842
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:48,360
An interesting comment about DDRPC from our resident joker in the chatroom, Pyroman, saying that you could put the arrows on stealth and then just please yourself watching Hi-Rez Charming.

843
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:56,360
And we have people with no sex life in our chat room.

844
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,320
Anyway, on that note I think we're going to take a quick break and re-situate some things

845
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,320
around the room.

846
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,920
I think Norman needs to prioritize a few things now that we've got a break.

847
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Now be nice.

848
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,920
Alright.

849
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,920
We're going to take a quick break.

850
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,920
We'll be back.

851
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,920
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

852
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Oh

853
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:19,360
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

854
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,640
the Orange Dance Bay money music and more shows?

855
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:29,160
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

856
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
It's unearthly.

857
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:35,640
It's like being at a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

858
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,640
And that's a message from someone who doesn't get a date.

859
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,840
Quit whispering in my ear.

860
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,200
We're joined by the individual who likes to whisper sweet nothings into my ear.

861
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Say hello everybody to Shaboom!

862
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Hi.

863
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Hey baby.

864
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,840
You want to say hello to the bee-monnie freaks of America, Micah?

865
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,840
Hi.

866
01:09:53,840 --> 01:10:00,640
Now, Micah, you don't really play these bee-monnie games, do you?

867
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:29,280
Oh, I have to point out though, however, for those of you concerned with the potty level

868
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:08,280
Rob, no offense, fuck that, but I feel like ditching.

869
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:36,280
R.P.C. has forty. Do the math. Forty bad songs. So, nine hundred and seventy-six. Forty!

870
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:43,080
Tough decision. I like, love this feeling, hello, because when all I had was DVR's second

871
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:49,360
mix on Dreamcast, that song came up four damn times a row on my non-stop. Don't you just

872
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:56,360
love random? You know what I have to laugh at? Say it again into the mic. Endless mode

873
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,360
Let the beat hit them four times in a row.

874
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,360
Love This Feeling has nothing on that.

875
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,360
So?

876
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:11,360
What I have to love is at Fry's, they have DDR PC there, and right below it they have Kiki Joys.

877
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,360
And for all those who might be running Sims and stuff and using Kiki Joys,

878
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:22,360
they don't allow you to push two buttons at the same time when it comes to the directional buttons.

879
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,360
I don't know, because they're dumb. That's the only converter that they have.

880
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
So, wait, who's the company that did it?

881
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,360
That issued Kiki Joy.

882
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,360
Fuck if I know.

883
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
Never heard of them.

884
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,360
Never heard of them. It just doesn't work. I own one.

885
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,360
Yeah, well, if you have a Kiki Joy, fucking light that shit on fire,

886
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,360
pick a shit on it, and smoke that shit.

887
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,360
The big indicator first is it's a giant pink object.

888
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:59,360
I've seen giant pink objects like that inserted in places, you know, not used correctly.

889
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,360
It doesn't always work good for anything that uses a standard Playstation controller because that's what it's meant for.

890
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:33,360
Not a dance pad. It is not meant to be played with a dance pad. Anyone that buys that for a dance pad is wasting their money, like I did.

891
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,360
Are you saying that it doesn't work on a dance pad?

892
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,360
It doesn't work because you can't push left and right or up and down at the same time.

893
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,360
What about a regular controller?

894
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:51,360
That's what most of the people will probably do on the PC anyways.

895
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,360
But when you buy DDR, you're not going to go,

896
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,360
Oh, I'm going to go buy a pad, okay?

897
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,360
It's all about the control.

898
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,360
It's all about the DDR personal massager, actually.

899
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,360
Everybody knows they want their big bumblebee in the bag, right?

900
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,360
And speaking of fucking things...

901
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,360
Anyway, let's change the subject now,

902
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,360
because we've got to get to Jamie's...

903
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
And actually everybody's going to participate.

904
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Well, not everybody, but the important people.

905
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,360
I'm just kidding.

906
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:19,120
Anticipating in the fu of the week two of the topics. I had to bitch about are going to be covered by other people

907
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,860
However, I will mention them all right here. We go keep my music

908
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,260
Man this is bad anyway my fuck you of the week once again

909
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:33,320
Just like last weekend week before goes toward Ragnarok online

910
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,400
also

911
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
also as

912
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,860
I don't care. This is my fuck you so fuck you

913
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,120
anyway

914
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,120
Or, as my friend referred to it, as Krakenrock, but still.

915
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,120
Anyway, for any people who have been keeping up with the game,

916
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:57,120
and I'm sorry for people who have recently downloaded Cyro,

917
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,120
the server, the international servers have gone down for three months.

918
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:07,120
They've gone the further step to ban any North American, you know, European IPs

919
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,120
that try to play on the Japanese or Korean servers.

920
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:17,120
And, you know, I had gotten to where I was enjoying it. It wasn't kicking me off nearly so much, and...

921
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:23,120
And guess what happened? They go down for three months. So fuck them, fuck them and their stupid asses.

922
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,120
I'm downloading a different game now.

923
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,120
And the next Fuck You of the Week goes toward AT&T, who I also hate.

924
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,120
My Fuck You of the Week is for AT&T Cable.

925
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,120
Damn them.

926
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:42,160
they've given us such wonderful new channels this week. We have Noggin, we have, which

927
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:47,200
is, Noggin fucking rules because they show the old school 80s Nickelodeon things, well

928
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:53,920
and early 90s, PDP, Clarissa Explains It All was on, and all this stuff. We get G4, which

929
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,240
is the new all-video-games-all-the-time channel, and we have, um, what else was on there, BBC

930
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:04,280
America, MTV2, and how does it count as a Fuck You again, and MTV2. Oh, it's here this

931
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,280
The reason why this is a fuck you of the week, when I tried to access these channels that said,

932
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:13,280
we're sorry, this is a subscription service, even though we're already raping you $50 a month for cable,

933
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,280
if you want these channels, you're going to have to pay $20 more.

934
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,280
Fuck you, I pay too much for my cable already.

935
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:26,280
You know, why don't you take off these shitty channels I don't want, like, I don't know, MSNBC, and give me...

936
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:32,760
oxygen yes take off take off lifetime with its fucking the only fucking cool

937
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,560
thing on lifetime is shop till you drop and they have that on packs now and

938
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,400
leave leave oxygen on because I got that old lady with the penis talk show see

939
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:47,960
that ever she goes this is a dick you put this in a lady pussy hole but on

940
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,340
lifetime also they have stories about like lesbians and them getting like

941
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,040
raped by their parents and then running away becoming foster children all the

942
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,040
fucked up shit that you can have all in one, like, hour and a half show.

943
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,040
Rob, I think you need to keep my music again.

944
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:09,040
I'm being told in the chat room that they will activate the channels for free, all you have to do is call, maybe for the first month, but, you know, if they're free, why don't they just give them to me?

945
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,040
We'll see.

946
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
Why do I have to call? Do I have to take a survey?

947
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:17,040
Why do you, sir, a 24-year-old individual, want to be watching Noggin Network?

948
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,040
Are you a pedophile, sir? No, dammit, I just want to relive my youth, is that so wrong?

949
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
I'm sorry, uh, JB's music.

950
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,040
Fuck them. Fuck them, you stupid ass.

951
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,880
The F.U. is linked to Panda Express.

952
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:30,580
Okay, Panda Express is like this wannabe Chinese food fast food place.

953
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:35,860
They have like a few things to order, I mean, and today they're out of practically everything.

954
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:41,800
Does anyone want anything, uh, other, well, white rice? Anyone want white rice?

955
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:48,800
I guess, okay, I'll get white rice, and then practically out of everything else, and they, you know, put my stuff in the bag,

956
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,800
My napkins got soaked in, I don't know what, some sort of juice.

957
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
Yeah, blood, I guess.

958
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
And they're fucking soup.

959
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
Panda Express is gonna give you AIDS.

960
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,800
It was probably Panda I was eating anyways.

961
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,800
But that's not the point.

962
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,800
Okay.

963
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
I got six from my lunch today.

964
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,800
And I was avoiding meat for that reason.

965
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,800
What pissed me off, I wanted chow mein.

966
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,800
I had to wait 25 minutes for them to fucking make some new chow mein

967
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Because they didn't think that, oh, when it's empty, when it's starting to get empty, and we've got a line going out the door, maybe it's time to make some more, you know?

968
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:32,800
You know, not that they could, you know, foresee these things in advance, they have to run out of it first, and then I'll be the next person in line that's like, oh, you gotta wait 25 minutes, so we can make more joe mains.

969
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
Eh, fuck you!

970
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,080
and my second uh... empty catfish

971
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:43,600
my second f-view a week goes to the stupid bitch at uh... fries

972
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,820
here's a here's a little information for you

973
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,920
if i'm peeing with a credit card that means i'm over eighteen you dumb bitch

974
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,960
so don't ask me if i'm eighteen

975
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,120
if i have a credit card here

976
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,640
so what if i'm buying the anime porn that doesn't mean anything

977
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,760
the dumb bitch had

978
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,760
had the nerve to tell me

979
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,760
Well that's not necessarily true, my brother's only 16, he's got an ATM credit card.

980
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
It's an ATM card!

981
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,760
It's an ATM card, okay?

982
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,760
ATM card, she said her 11-year-old son had a fucking credit card.

983
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,760
How the fuck is he going to pay off a credit card?

984
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,760
Yeah, so have you been accused of having a false ID when you were 26 years old?

985
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,760
I've been called a platinum card dude, so it's not even really funny.

986
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:35,760
No, I have not, but I've been refused to have a movie because I didn't have my ID with me.

987
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,760
Stupid Chico Theater not letting me see Dead Men on campus.

988
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,760
You should be thanking them.

989
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,760
Yes, I did see that later on. Here, I'm scared for life.

990
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:51,760
No, I was at... This is one of my other fuck yous from Manuea Expo that I haven't brought up yet.

991
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:57,760
The fact that when I went to go buy... By the way, the doujinshi didn't turn out to be Yali, by the way.

992
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,080
no yellow, no gay penis, what will we do?

993
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,900
But no, the guy there wanted me to get my mom

994
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,900
so that I could buy Dojinshi

995
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:13,480
and then I showed him my license and my ID

996
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,360
On the topic of anime porn

997
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,680
I have another F.U. that's long overdue that goes to the stupid makers of that

998
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,320
movie

999
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,640
Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls. God damn that movie sucks ass

1000
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,640
It's just like horrible flash anime.

1001
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,640
Who the fuck bought that? Why?

1002
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,640
That was a horrible flash anime that someone made years and years ago,

1003
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,640
and someone actually went out and published.

1004
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,640
I can't believe you paid for it.

1005
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,640
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1006
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,640
It was funny.

1007
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,640
He was dumb.

1008
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
I was stupid.

1009
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,640
I was stupid again. No!

1010
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,640
Anyway, have we got done fucking everyone?

1011
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,640
Well...

1012
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,640
I don't know. Now serving, 47.

1013
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,640
Anyway, um, DDRholic,

1014
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,640
hi by the way, I hope we see you at Gulfline this week,

1015
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,640
says that they issue credit cards to kids with prepaid limits from Daddy.

1016
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,640
Like one of those secured credit cards, where like Daddy pays $300, so

1017
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,640
you know, Junior can have a $300 credit card to buy anime porn with.

1018
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,640
Okay, but my credit card didn't say, oh look, it's a kid card, you know, with the big happy

1019
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,640
It doesn't have Ronald McDonald on it.

1020
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,640
No, it doesn't.

1021
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,640
And the dumb bitch didn't even have the smarts look at my fucking, you know...

1022
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,640
So you didn't get the Sailor Moon Platinum card then?

1023
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,640
Did you go with your seven balls purchase?

1024
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,640
No, I did not.

1025
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,640
I can't believe you bought that, dude. What the fuck?

1026
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:42,640
Of all the goddamn gimpy anime porn out there, you got something that I could make in my fucking sleeve.

1027
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:48,640
He wouldn't have the Sailor Moon one. He, you know, did think he was younger, so he had, like, Super Doll Likaton or something.

1028
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,640
Yay, my Gundam credit card!

1029
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,640
Hey, okay, I like watching...

1030
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:57,640
I like watching 10 frame animation with stupid sound clips repeated over and over again.

1031
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,640
Then play DDR!

1032
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,640
Well...

1033
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,640
Oh yeah, gotcha there!

1034
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,640
Good point.

1035
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:13,640
It's like the songs are like sequence. You know, you sit there and listen to the worst sample out of the fucking one and a half minutes they could possibly be.

1036
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,800
well you know that would kind of bring it back to that old topic we were just

1037
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,440
talking about the characters and all the

1038
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,000
no pants rage

1039
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,840
anyway moving right along

1040
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,440
i don't know what i really have any other subjects discussed

1041
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,900
pepsi blue

1042
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,760
well

1043
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,440
yeah i get to talk again

1044
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,920
pepsi blue is really good, hey shut up

1045
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,760
pepsi blue is hella good

1046
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,260
Everybody at the tournament was drinking that- SHUT UP!

1047
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,840
Yeah, okay, anyway.

1048
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,260
That shit was good.

1049
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:52,260
Fucking Red Fusion takes, like, cough syrup. It's Frosty Poop.

1050
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,720
I like Red Fusion better.

1051
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,240
Oh, to hell anyways.

1052
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,620
Pepsi Blue on your daddy. I want to tell some stories. Let's talk about, let's

1053
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,520
make this B.E. Monty related,

1054
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,240
and talk about refreshing drinks to play when playing DDR.

1055
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,060
Um,

1056
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,880
obviously Ramun,

1057
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,580
The greatest drink that ever came in a pixie cup with that damn marble in there

1058
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,820
So you can't tell how much fucking liquid is in there begin with

1059
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,020
It's all about pocari sweat

1060
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:27,320
What the fuck pocari sweat pocari sweat looks like sweat smells like what tastes like sweetened sweat and comes in a goddamn bottle

1061
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,320
That says sweat

1062
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,680
Pocari sweat is the absolute winner of all fitness tricks. It's one of the worst sports tricks. I've ever had my goddamn life

1063
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:40,840
I would just like to say Shiba for that lovely description of pakari sweat. Thank you captain obvious

1064
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,520
Hey, you couldn't have thought of a better fucking name for it

1065
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,800
It's it tastes like it's citrusy, but it's supposed to be like Gatorade, but it doesn't taste like shit

1066
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,720
It looks like salty water, and it tastes like it too. It is not as salty as Gatorade

1067
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:00,240
I like that shit that you bought at my propel water is propel water that I like that water is absolute winner

1068
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,620
Well speaking you know about Gatorade sweat thing. I mean you know you see him

1069
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:09,620
I'm sweating out that shit. I'm sure they'll just collect it. There you go, that's how they get that shit, you know?

1070
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,620
What's it called? They call it drink?

1071
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:16,620
You know, I've already stated that when, you know, when that Boba cafe that...

1072
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:17,620
Boob.

1073
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:23,620
When we open our tapioca express, I'm going to try to have a Pocari Sweat Vending Machine.

1074
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,620
If I can find one.

1075
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:29,620
Boba's an entirely different subject, man. I had that freaking starfruit flavor. It tasted like ass.

1076
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:34,620
Someone in the chat will bring up balls. Now, balls is the most interesting soda I've ever seen.

1077
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,620
Hey, it's blue.

1078
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,620
Yeah, it's blue, and it says BALLS.

1079
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:42,620
It's a big bottle of balls. You can't really go wrong with it, except for, you know, it's not the most pleasant tasting stuff.

1080
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,620
And it feels like balls. The glass.

1081
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,620
And Rob would go...

1082
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,620
Oh my...

1083
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,620
No, no, not those. I'm talking about, like, an actual little ball.

1084
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,620
You can use them to give someone a back massage.

1085
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,620
Right.

1086
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,620
Balls!

1087
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,620
No.

1088
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,620
The Propel Water basically tastes like Ghetto Kool-Aid should.

1089
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,620
So it's really awesome.

1090
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,620
Oh, we got plenty of time. Who cares, dude?

1091
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,620
We'll talk until they throw us off.

1092
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,620
Yes, we...share with us.

1093
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,620
We need...we need...

1094
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:17,620
I want to share a lot of the...

1095
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,620
Wait, before you start your story, I'm going to give you story music, okay?

1096
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,620
So let's find some story music for Mike.

1097
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:26,620
It's about our little Mexican friend, Jose.

1098
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:29,620
Now don't make this a racist story or I'm going to have to...

1099
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,620
Okay, okay.

1100
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,620
Are we going to have to say anything?

1101
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,620
Yes.

1102
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:39,620
Alright, here we go. Let's talk to Mike and let's hear Mike's story.

1103
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,620
What's the music?

1104
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,620
The Journey to Wonderland.

1105
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:49,620
Word! Anyway, okay, as all of you know,

1106
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:56,620
know. You know the guy Jose who ran the Fremont tournament. Oh no, he was at the tournament

1107
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:06,440
on Thursday and Friday. A couple of my friends, DCB and Chaos, come up to me and they randomly

1108
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:16,200
ask me, why does Jose smell like shit? And why is he wearing the same clothes as he was

1109
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:21,560
the day before and i'm really afraid of where this is going we all go you've all been to

1110
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:26,600
sunnyvale golf land hopefully and you've all seen the giant clown mouth and hopefully you've

1111
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,240
all seen the picture where well you all know that somebody's pissed in the clown mouth

1112
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:40,600
anyway so you crazy sunnyvale people so the word's going around that like jail chiz

1113
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:50,600
The Mexican guy slept in the clown mouth Thursday night because he had no ride home from the tournament because it was a two-day tournament.

1114
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,600
So, yeah, that's my story.

1115
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,600
It was supposed to be funny, but nobody's laughing, so I feel like an idiot now.

1116
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,600
I'm blinking.

1117
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,600
We're not laughing at you, we're laughing inside.

1118
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,600
I'm not a pop 8, but I'm a cool 7.

1119
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:13,240
And I'm a soul six.

1120
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
And I'm not going there.

1121
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,800
Hey, I heard 2DX.

1122
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,800
We badly need a break.

1123
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,600
Oh, did Matt want to say something real fast?

1124
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,260
Uh, well, I was just going to talk about my experience of playing, uh, Samba Date, whatever

1125
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,560
that crap is.

1126
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,560
Make it snappy.

1127
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,560
Today.

1128
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,560
Well, I was going to do it after break.

1129
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,560
Alright, we'll do it after break.

1130
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Okay.

1131
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,160
Well, we're going to take a quick break.

1132
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,160
We will be right back.

1133

If you get through the night, if you get through the night

1144
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:19,320
We're... We're...

1145
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,320
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man can fight the fear.

1146
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,320
He knew he had to try to let love in.

1147
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,320
His mother let her know, she was in the mood for talking.

1148
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,320
So when he began to play the game, before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been

1149
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,320
hurting.

1150
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,320
How he was hoping she was not the same.

1151
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,320
Who'd you say?

1152
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,320
Who'd you say?

1153
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,320
Who'd you say?

1154
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,320
Who'd you say?

1155
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
Ain't no man can fight those feelings

1156
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,320
He knew he had to try to let love in

1157
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,320
Mother let her know

1158
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,320
She was in the mood for talking

1159
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,320
So when he began to play the game

1160
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,320
Before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting

1161
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,320
How he was hoping she was not the same

1162
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,320
Could you see the time that waiting's gonna begin

1163
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,320
After all of this time could just be true love

1164
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,320
And she said boy you don't have to love no more

1165
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,320
I'll give the love you need till you holler in the guarantee

1166
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,320
Alexa, boy, I'm a fine lady

1167
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,320
You've been hurt so deep so good I am the cure

1168
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,320
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

1169
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,320
Just let me, boy, you know you can still haunt me

1170
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,320
And leave me

1171
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,320
I'm a fine lady

1172
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,320
You know what you found in me

1173
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,320
As a lady, I'm a lady

1174
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,320
Cause I can give you what you need

1175
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,320
Baby, I'm a fine lady

1176
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:33,920
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

1177
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,600
favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

1178
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,720
Do it all night, do it with me.

1179
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,680
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible, do you take vocal lessons, kill your teacher!

1180
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,400
In the heat of the night.

1181
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,800
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding!

1182
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,600
I liked it!

1183
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,400
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

1184
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,600
Oh... that was cool...

1185
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,000
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

1186
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,600
Come on, baby! Come on, do it with me!

1187
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,200
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

1188
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:16,200
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1189
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,200
We'll see, we'll see what we come up with, uh, during the week.

1190
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,200
Anyway, um, let's see.

1191
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Uh, what else did they say? They said something else.

1192
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Oh yeah, they wanted us to talk about how American Idol is trying to warp our minds.

1193
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:57,200
No, we have a segment to do. Anyway, we're gonna do a list list.

1194
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Yes.

1195
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,200
Yes, we're gonna bring back another. Speaking of old, old shit, we're gonna do, um...

1196
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,200
What we can do? If we run over a little bit, so what?

1197
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,200
How about that? We'll just run over a little bit if we must.

1198
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,200
You know, we run over everything, so we may as well run over our limit, too.

1199
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,200
We'll close the show with doing a little Listless here.

1200
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,200
So, um...

1201
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,200
I don't...

1202
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,200
I don't know what they're trying...

1203
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,200
They're flooding the chat room with information.

1204
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,200
I'm trying to find game show music.

1205
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,200
Explain how Listless works for everybody.

1206
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Well, basically what Listless is, is we have our five lovely, talented, and quite beautiful contestants.

1207
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Each pick three items on the list of the subject matter.

1208
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:40,200
And then we each go around and we put up our items until we have a list, in this case a 15.

1209
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:47,200
Then each of us goes around voting to put one off, then we leave it to our chat room to vote what the final result is going to be.

1210
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,200
Don't you think I summed that up nicely?

1211
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,200
Yes, so on that note...

1212
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,200
Let's play Listless!

1213
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,200
That was really cheesy.

1214
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,200
That was beautiful.

1215
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Speaking of lovely and talented.

1216
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,700
So, who wants to start this? Let's start with our guests.

1217
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,700
Let's start with our guests. Mike, your number... Oh, our topic tonight.

1218
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:13,200
Oh, yes. We have a topic tonight, and that topic is what we feel is the best 2DX video.

1219
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:19,700
The best videos in 2DX ever. And the chat room, you guys are gonna get a chance to vote on our finished list,

1220
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,700
and you guys will determine the top three.

1221
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:25,700
So, here we go, starting with DDRMike giving his number three pick.

1222
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:29,700
Okay, my number three pick would be WowWow70s.

1223
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,700
Ah, good choice. WowWow70s.

1224
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,200
Number two!

1225
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,700
Expla- wait, no no no no, you don't get to s-

1226
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:35,200
Explain it?

1227
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,700
Explain- just a brief synopsis for those that may not have seen it.

1228
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,700
The song kicks ass.

1229
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,700
And...

1230
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,700
No, fuck that shit.

1231
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,700
The song just kicks ass, I'm just gonna say that.

1232
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,700
The video is really cool. It's really detailed.

1233
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,700
I like how they have all the characters and shit in it.

1234
01:39:55,700 --> 01:40:10,580
For number three, I pick a song that I cannot say, Choto et Kizina.

1235
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,420
I think that's how you say it.

1236
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:19,180
It's a video from Second Cell, I believe, and the girl is dancing in the window.

1237
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,980
All she does through the video is dance in the window and sing the song.

1238
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:26,980
How cool can you get?

1239
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:30,980
Cool as ice, featuring vanilla ice.

1240
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,980
Okay. How about Matt?

1241
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,980
I think we have to go to G2.

1242
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:39,980
G2. And briefly explain G2 a little bit.

1243
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:43,980
G2 has a creepy alien chick flying around looking like something.

1244
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:44,980
Tran.

1245
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:48,980
Yeah, Tran flying around looking like she's attacking the cameraman.

1246
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:51,980
It's very dark and goes with this song very well.

1247
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:52,980
Sounds good.

1248
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:53,980
Jamie?

1249
01:40:53,980 --> 01:41:01,540
My number three, which for my list would have to be Ride on the Light, because well as my

1250
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:07,820
fiancé has described it, it's basically like an Evangelion fight done with little chibi

1251
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,820
thingies.

1252
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,740
Alright, fair enough.

1253
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:21,140
My number three pick is Right Now by Atomic Kitten, because I like crap, and it reminds

1254
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,740
me of the Spice Girls, so there you go, Right Now.

1255
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:28,140
Hold on, Rob, I might be giving you an early birthday present next year.

1256
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,140
Okay.

1257
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,140
Alright.

1258
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:33,100
What, are you going to fart?

1259
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,100
That's not a present.

1260
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:35,100
Okay.

1261
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,100
Do you like crap?

1262
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,100
It's a present everyone can share.

1263
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,100
Nah, there it is.

1264
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,100
You're gross.

1265
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:44,100
You know, it's not the Spice Girls. If you're talking about crap, it's the Shite Girls.

1266
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:45,100
Anyway, you're-

1267
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,100
TDR Mike, let's hear the number two choice of yours.

1268
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,100
Number two for me would be 250 BPM.

1269
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,100
250 BPM.

1270
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:57,100
Because of the crazy shit baby, devil baby, fucking schizo shit.

1271
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,100
I'm about to have a seizure. The Satan fetus must die.

1272
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:06,100
Yeah, exactly. Kill the fucking fetus.

1273
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,100
My second big is love is dreaminess.

1274
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,100
Love is dreaminess.

1275
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,100
Just because running robots are good that cool.

1276
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:25,100
Okay, my second big would have to go to Romeo and Juliet.

1277
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,100
Romeo and Juliet.

1278
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,100
Because of those crazy neon bears in the background.

1279
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,100
They're so cute.

1280
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,100
My number two would have to be for the cutest video ever, Sweet Lab.

1281
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,100
Sweet Lab? Oh, that's a good pick. I didn't even think of that one.

1282
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,100
It's so cute!

1283
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,100
Okay.

1284
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,100
Would you briefly describe the Sweet Lab video a little bit?

1285
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:51,100
It's just a cute little thingy walking through the forest being cute and doing more cute things.

1286
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:56,100
I hardly ever get to watch the video because usually I'm cussing at the song while I'm playing it.

1287
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,100
Okay, um, what?

1288
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:01,100
Cracker! How could you forget that?

1289
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:04,100
You weren't here when we started making our picks. You can't play right now.

1290
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:08,100
You can play next week. I'm sorry. You can listen, though.

1291
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,100
Maybe somebody has Cracker written down.

1292
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:13,100
We're not to the end of the list yet.

1293
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:15,100
We're not to the end of the list yet.

1294
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,100
Next?

1295
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:20,100
Did I get your pick right now? Yes, sweet. I did get it right now.

1296
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:24,100
My number two pick is a very new one, but it's fucking hilarious.

1297
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,100
The Strong Yeager.

1298
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:32,580
with with you know the with dungeon J humping himself and that's one of the

1299
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:40,780
Jaeger all right so the strong Jaeger anyway she was trying to take over the

1300
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:43,460
controls here but he can't because we're trying to do something here all right

1301
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:50,260
number one picks okay my number one pick would be cheer train because it has the

1302
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,260
Coolest lyrics ever.

1303
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,260
And...

1304
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,260
Yeah.

1305
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,260
And it's all clay animation and shit.

1306
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:00,260
And like, the stock animation is really cool.

1307
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,260
Cool.

1308
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,260
Yeah, I like Cheer Train. It's cool.

1309
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,260
Yeah, so cool, cool, cool.

1310
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,260
Good, cool.

1311
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,260
Go figure, that was mine.

1312
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,260
Oh, alright, Cheer Train, number one pick for you two. Alright, fair enough.

1313
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:16,260
Alright, my all-time favorite has to be Greediest Cyber.

1314
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:18,260
Ah.

1315
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,260
Whatever! I don't care!

1316
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:24,260
I made the same mistake last week, don't worry about it.

1317
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:28,260
It has a really kick-ass animation video very similar to Burning Heat, but it's awesome.

1318
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:31,260
Ron, you always call it graduistic, and that is not right.

1319
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:34,260
Whatever.

1320
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,260
Whatever, I'll do what I want, I'll do what I want.

1321
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:38,260
I'm actually changing my number one.

1322
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,260
You can't.

1323
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:42,260
It's too bad. I'm a woman, I can do it, I have boobs.

1324
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:45,260
As much as I love reincarnation,

1325
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:53,260
I actually am going to vote for Burning Heat, simply because I am such a Gradius II fan, it's not even funny.

1326
01:44:53,260 --> 01:45:00,260
And that just is like, completely brings back the frustration of fighting the fire dragons and everything.

1327
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:06,260
Fair enough. Well, my number one pick also happens to already be on the list. I put down Love is Dreaminess as my number one pick, so...

1328
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:09,260
Then you can stick to Reincreditation.

1329
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:12,260
I'll, uh, I don't know, give it to a wildcard.

1330
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:17,260
We never hear from Bradley on this show. What do you want? You get a wildcard pick. Any 2DX video?

1331
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:20,260
I'm putting it on the spot, but I don't think.

1332
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,260
Think, man, think!

1333
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,260
I think that's a subcontractor.

1334
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:29,260
I like the video, but that's not one of my biggest favorites.

1335
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,260
Uh, outer wall.

1336
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:32,260
Dude, outer wall is...

1337
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:36,260
Outer wall, okay. So there's a wildcard pick. Outer wall.

1338
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:44,260
Now here's the fun part, now we're going to go around the room and you get to take one song off of the list, so starting with DDR Mike.

1339
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:49,260
You see the list right in front of you, you can take off any one of those songs that you think, why the hell is that song there?

1340
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:59,260
Romeo and Juliet, because fuck fuck fuck para, and fuck all you para-lists out there, you fucking faggots!

1341
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:05,260
Fucking die para para tiger! I'm going to fucking cut your dick off you bitch!

1342
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,260
I encourage people to rave on Parapara.

1343
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:11,260
You can send those cards and letters to DDR Mike, care of Sunnyvale Golf Land.

1344
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:13,260
Alright.

1345
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,260
Needless to say, Romeo and Juliet is off the list. Oh!

1346
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:21,260
And a big hearty fuck you Mike from the chat room. There you go.

1347
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:24,260
I say bye bye to G2.

1348
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:27,260
Bye bye to G2.

1349
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,260
So long.

1350
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,260
Next.

1351
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,260
Next.

1352
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:35,260
I'm going to have to say bye-bye to Cheer Drain because I hate the lyrics.

1353
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:39,260
I hate the lyrics and I think the little peeps are stupid.

1354
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:43,260
Stand by to win. No, stand by to lose. Aww.

1355
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:49,260
I vote for 2.50 BPM to go bye-bye because the Satan fetus scares me.

1356
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:55,260
No! I literally had nightmares about the damn Satan fetus when I first played Fourth Style, so no.

1357
01:46:55,260 --> 01:47:11,000
So that leaves us with our list.

1358
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,220
WowWow 70s, Ride on the Light, right now, how did that stay?

1359
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:24,560
I'm so happy, Love is Dreaminess, Sweet Lab, The Strong Jaeger, Grad U-6 Cyber,

1360
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,240
burning heat and outer wall

1361
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:31,320
those are choices and if you would like to vote on those

1362
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,720
you have to be in the chat room just send me a private message

1363
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:38,240

1364
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:42,440

1365
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,680
I only take it through private message if you don't send me private message

1366
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:49,560
it don't count so you've got right now you've got a whopping

1367
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,760
you got a whopping three minutes to vote we're gonna throw in a quick song and

1368
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,120
And then we'll tally up the votes, and that'll be the end of the damn show.

1369
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,120
So um...

1370
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,120
Huh?

1371
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:04,600
Okay, well, we'll give you a request from Jamie, because she's a woman and she wants

1372
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,600
to hear a woman's song.

1373
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,600
So here's Batgirls!

1374
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:30,360
Hey girl, talkin' bout this, hey girl Hey girl, talkin' bout this, hey girl

1375
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:33,360
I see them out on the streets at night

1376
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,360
Walking, picking up those kind of strangers

1377
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,360
It's right, it's right, when you can't go

1378
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,360
It's fucking time

1379
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,360
What you want in your time

1380
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,360
You ask yourself

1381
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,360
Who they are

1382
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,360
Like everybody else

1383
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,360
Oh

1384
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:18,280
I've been waiting up long Late at night when you're all alone

1385
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:23,320
It's hard to take, pick up the phone But even on, with someone else

1386
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:26,320
You wanna keep this love all for yourself

1387
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,320
You think you're being laid deep inside

1388
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:31,320
Kinda love is so hard to find

1389
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,320
Gotta keep it up for myself

1390
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:36,320
Don't wanna share it with somebody else

1391
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:40,320
No one knows what goes on when we are all alone

1392
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,320
I know what I feel is so surreal

1393
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:48,320
We are sacred lovers

1394
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,320
Hope no one lets go

1395
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:54,320
I see you every day, see me hide away, just around the way

1396
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:59,320
If you're so close to me, don't look at my time, I see

1397
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,320
What we held ever since, I seek you from the angle

1398
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:09,320
I'm your love, baby, you're my love to me

1399
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,320
Baby, I'm the one who needs you, baby, I'm the one who needs you

1400
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:19,320
You can whip my baby, you can don't say maybe

1401
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:24,320
Roll away the king, it's so bad to see only you and me

1402
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,320
I hold on one last gun

1403
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:29,320
And we're under cover and I'm not leaving

1404
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:31,320
What's been happening here

1405
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,320
I'm sick of my neighbor

1406
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,320
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF

1407
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,320
And for an extra $1.99 a minute

1408
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:49,320
Maybe my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1409
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:55,320
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

1410
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:03,320
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1411
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:08,320
Yes, that was our special guest last week, Mel B, saying, uh, listen to our damn show.

1412
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:14,320
And I'd like to say, because we're about at the end of the show, thank you guys very much for being here this week, DDR Mike.

1413
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,320
Yes.

1414
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,320
Yes.

1415
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,560
Uh, the always, I should say the always colorful DDR mic.

1416
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,560
Yes.

1417
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:26,960
I was hoping he'd take a buck, yes, alright, and uh, fuck yes, I think.

1418
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,560
And uh, big thank you also to Jazz for being here.

1419
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,560
Meow.

1420
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,560
Meow.

1421
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:33,560
Well put.

1422
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:36,520
Well we're not saying goodbye just yet, we're not saying goodbye just yet, but I just wanted

1423
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:39,360
to make sure we thanked you guys for being here and coming out to, you guys think you

1424
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,360
might be back sometime soon?

1425
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,360
Yes.

1426
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:58,720
Let us then reveal our top 3, as decided by the whole listless procedure, top 3 2DX videos.

1427
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,600
Here we go.

1428
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,960
In third place, drum roll please, burning heat.

1429
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,720
Alright, ready for burning heat.

1430
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,140
Let's give them some privilege.

1431
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:19,880
In second place, is the strong Jaeger.

1432
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:30,320
And in first place, for the super duper bestest ever 2DX video is, everybody, is Love is Dreaminess.

1433
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,320
Yay.

1434
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:38,040
Okay, so those are our winners and, oh yeah, they win.

1435
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:46,200
give our winner song a little victory dance here. Give me a minute. Prepare your drill.

1436
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:51,480
Get the Lego man out. It's time to play Love is Dreaminess. Or Love is, you know, also

1437
01:54:51,480 --> 01:55:01,840
on crack. Alright, I'm not going to play the whole thing. You got a sample there. I play

1438
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,200
that all the time on the show, so if you haven't heard Love is Dreaminess yet, just tune into

1439
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:09,780
To our Bomani Music and More program, which is always on the station when we're not 24

1440
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:10,780
hours a day, 7 days a week.

1441
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:16,780
Sorry, that video was Love is Dreaminess on LSD.

1442
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:21,220
Love is a hallucination.

1443
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:24,420
We got a few minutes left, somebody's trying to catch my attention in the chat room, just

1444
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,020
tell me whatever the hell you want to say.

1445
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:29,180
We'll talk about it, we got a few more seconds here on the show, I'm being sent a private

1446
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,180
message.

1447
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,180
We have as long as we want to have it.

1448
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:32,180
Okay, let's let Matt talk there.

1449
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:36,180
Okay, so I finally got to play that Samba de Amigo or whatever that is.

1450
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,180
That game is weird.

1451
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:40,180
Okay, they want you to strike poses and shit like that.

1452
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:43,180
It's got, you know, fucking Ricky Martin in the mock arena.

1453
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:46,180
This is a bad combo, man.

1454
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:50,180
You need my VMU file that has the Burning Rangers song on it

1455
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:54,180
and the song from Austin Powers.

1456
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:57,180
And yes, we get a thumbs up from that.

1457
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:01,180
And, you know, the Oppa Oppa theme from Fantasy Zone.

1458
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:03,180
Do you ever play Fantasy Zone?

1459
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,180
No.

1460
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:05,180
Ah.

1461
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,180
Poetry Pride person.

1462
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:07,180
Huh?

1463
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:11,180
I thought you guys were talking about something that should be on the air.

1464
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,180
We're just about to.

1465
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:14,680
I'm being sent one more preview song for 8th Style.

1466
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,620
This is Past Career, it's called.

1467
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,180
It's being sent to me so I can play it for you over the show in a minute.

1468
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:25,240
Who is the artist?

1469
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,420
I have no clue.

1470
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:27,420
Where is this from?

1471
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,420
It's not on my list of songs in, uh, 8th style.

1472
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:34,420
Yeah, you gotta tell me where the hell this is from.

1473
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:36,420
Person who's sending it to me.

1474
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:38,420
Please do.

1475
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:40,420
Where'd he go?

1476
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:43,420
It takes a minute. Okay, here he is.

1477
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,420
Use both hands!

1478
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:47,420
Oh, he's saying it's the 7th style theme.

1479
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:49,420
Why does it say 8th style?

1480
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,420
It's supposedly the 7th style theme.

1481
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,420
Well, that's cool.

1482
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:07,420
Dude, it's okay. We still love you.

1483
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,420
Hey!

1484
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:16,420
Hey, Pamphlet's Rage.

1485
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:20,420
We're in about the old range of four miles an hour. I don't know.

1486
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:52,420
It is very cool. This is playable on 8 style. On 8-er style.

1487
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:54,420
Aired.

1488
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,420
But you know.

1489
01:57:56,420 --> 01:57:58,420
I can imagine this would be really difficult.

1490
01:57:58,420 --> 01:58:02,420
Tomorrow Perfume was the theme of 2DX 6 style and now it's in 7 style.

1491
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:04,420
Yes, we...

1492
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:12,420
Yeah, but we're talking about 2DX, not Deep Mania. Not Five Finger Ganis.

1493
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:21,920
I still am of the opinion that maybe that should be our, you know, clip of the week.

1494
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,360
Thank you SoCalKicks for sending me that file because if I don't say his name, he'll cry.

1495
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,360
Anyway, I'm sorry, what?

1496
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,820
He was talking about five fingering.

1497
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:31,820
I still have you beat.

1498
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,440
I talked about the king of iron fingering.

1499
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,500
On that note, we are going to close out the show.

1500
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,580
Thank you to everybody for listening.

1501
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:37,740
Thank you to all the guests for being here.

1502
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:38,740
Thank you.

1503
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,740
Does anybody have any last minute thoughts?

1504
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:46,780
Yeah, if Nikkari, if you're listening out there, yeah, you're like the coolest gay person

1505
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:47,780
I've ever met.

1506
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:48,780
Hey!

1507
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:49,780
So are you!

1508
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:50,780
Hey!

1509
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:55,220
And, okay, half the community is gay, so it don't matter.

1510
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:56,220
Watch science.

1511
01:58:56,220 --> 01:59:00,100
Nikkari's cool and all, but, you know, share the love, come on.

1512
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,220
Fuck it, I hate everybody!

1513
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,220
Are you the gay?

1514
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:07,980
Watch that movie, Science, is like the best movie I've ever seen.

1515
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:10,980
That's awesome. Go see it. Don't read about it. Just go see it.

1516
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,980
Watch the Powerpuff movie. It's better.

1517
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:14,980
Shut up.

1518
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:17,980
Good night, everybody. Thank you for putting up with this train wreck all night long.

1519
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:19,980
Any last thoughts from Jamie? Jamie, you get the final word.

1520
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:23,980
I told you, my head's empty. I drank it all out last night.

1521
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:26,980
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
