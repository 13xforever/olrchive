Mecha lecha hi, mecha hiney ho.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Me too!

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Sucker, yeah?

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm working on it.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Loser.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Lame!

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm the father of my faith.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Breathing.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Breathless.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Heaving breath.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Heaving whatever.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut,

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
while I go listen to my written experience records.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I am your singing telegram.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,300
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,020
on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,400
You're tuned in to the Belmonte Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Beymane.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,980
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,300
Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,580
This is episode number eight for August the 11th of 2002 and of course, as always, we're

33
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,880
joined by many in-studio friends tonight.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,620
We've got Irene, Bradley, and Brad, and Lucy DiGordo, and Tal.

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,560
And this is the first time that Tal's ever heard the intro, also, I think.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
It gets old really fast.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,500
We're going to have a new one for show ten.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Show ten, we get a whole new thing.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
We'll have a whole new website and everything.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Yes.

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,980
We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take

42
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,620
a quick break, and I'm going to work in a request I've been trying to play for like

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,340
the past three weeks.

44
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,940
But I know that Jamie has an extra special request to give out.

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,220
So this goes out to Kelly, happy birthday, and here is your request.

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,860
Happy birthday to you.

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,860
yeah whatever we'll be back

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Even though you tell me that I can't fly I ain't easy to hurt

49
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,860
I have a perfect life and I'm telling you I'll hide

50
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm a cowgirl and I'm riding on my old bang-a-doo-bang

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
And I'm shooting all around

52
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm a cowgirl, I be straight to the source Bang-a-doo-bang

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,860
It's so good to be back

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,860
I'm a cowgirl, and I'm riding on my phone

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,360
Bang bang bang, stayin' light on the phone

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm a cowgirl, and I'm happy with that

57
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Bang bang, it's so good to be back

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,860
I know that you want me, honey

59
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,860
I've been in so much fear

60
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
So many hard things for love

61
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,860
You know that I've only been around

62
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
You've been in my house

63
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Walking all by step

64
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I've just been found meaning

65
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,860
I'm just asking for the real love

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,860
It's gonna make me feel

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Take me higher

68
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:26,860
I'm lost inside of me, trapped in a motion Where am I going to?

69
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,360
I need to live, I need to let go

70
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Of all the friends and thoughts inside my mind

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,860
From all the chains combined

72
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,860
How can I find my way to you?

73
00:06:50,860 --> 00:07:09,860
I see you reaching for my hand I see you seeking the secrets of my heart

74
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,860
To chase the silhouette of my own life with each other

75
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:41,860
How can I find my way through you, each and every one of my dreams?

76
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,860
You chase me with a mile an hour

77
00:07:46,860 --> 00:08:13,260
And that's it, you heard a special request, Bambi with Cowgirl and Mr. T Take Me Higher

78
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:21,560
from 2DX4 style, 2DX6 style, Silhouette of My Mind, which Jamie thinks quite the opposite

79
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,380
of ass when it comes to Silhouette of My Mind.

80
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,940
That is like my favorite song, and I have two fuck yous of the week now, that's my music.

81
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,500
You want to get right into the fuck yous of the week?

82
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes.

83
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,060
Well I had to say something really fast because we were talking about 2D, Mr. T Take Me Higher

84
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,580
was a request I think I got about three weeks ago, and I've been trying to play it every

85
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,300
week, I wasn't able to get it in that week, I've been trying to play it every week since.

86
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,140
last file was messed up. I keep getting messed up files, except we finally got an MP3 encoded

87
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,560
that works, so I was able to finally get that request out there. And of course, what does

88
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,380
it bring up but chatter about the 2DX4 style booty dancers. Everybody's favorite. I just

89
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,980
think it was funny how at least a good fifth of the people at the last Sviggle tournament

90
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,860
were doing the booty dance. That was awesome. I remember seeing a routine where somebody

91
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,460
was actually dancing to that song, and I swear, it was like, if it wasn't the exact booty

92
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,680
dance, it was heavily influenced by the 2DX4 style booty dancers, and for those that don't

93
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,860
know the 2DX4 style booty dancers, they're these two dancers that appear in probably

94
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,460
five or six of the videos in 4 style, I know they show up in Conga, Take Me Higher, what

95
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
else do you...

96
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,460
Gary Gary Daddy.

97
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Gary Gary Daddy.

98
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,980
No, they don't show up in Star Mine.

99
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,220
Shut up, Brad.

100
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,220
And Nasty.

101
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Nasty.

102
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
Ooh.

103
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Every time I hear nasty, I think of the Janet Jackson song.

104
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,220
No, we're not talking about the booty dancers from 3rd Style, because 3rd Style also has

105
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,220
some real Jerry Springer ghetto booty dancers.

106
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,220
The 4th Style ones, though, were still booty. They were like Booty Max.

107
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,220
Booty Max.

108
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,220
3rd Style may be Booty Deluxe, I don't know.

109
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Remember the solo mix Booty Dancers?

110
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,700
every freaking thing on solo bass and they're like ugly ass people who are

111
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,900
just kind of busting their groove I guess is the proper term for this

112
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,660
that's awful looking that's the reason to ban a solo machine about the badly

113
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,500
animated booty dancers from the old beat manias oh yeah oh yeah that's not even

114
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,540
like real videos if that's just like bad crappy animation like two frames a

115
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,500
second animation of like they sure are booty all right oh we're also being

116
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,060
asked in the chat room, when am we? When am we? You're going to have to excuse our show

117
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,500
tonight. We're a little out of it tonight. Which I know we said last week, except this

118
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,780
week we're not drunk, we're just, I don't know, Jamie. We'll get to your F.U. of the

119
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,740
week and we'll hear. What else do I want to say? I want to say something about the booty

120
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,140
dancers. Oh yes, our resident comedian in the chat room, Pyro Man, says the lady is

121
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,580
half booty dancer half mafia girl and half cutie pie which adds up to three

122
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,100
halves but whatever so that means that like there's another half of her

123
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:17,820
floating around that sort of pulsing and bloody and gory and on that note oh let

124
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,540
me plug the chat room real fast if you want to join in our chat room festivities

125
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,820
all you have to do is join any other side IRC server so if you just go and

126
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,860
download M-I-R-C at M-I-R-C dot com and then you're just going to connect to any other

127
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,400
side I-R-C server like I-R-C dot A-

128
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I have to interrupt this piece.

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Wow.

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
What?

131
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
That was the giddiest hand gesture I've ever seen from me.

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Shut up.

133
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
It's radio.

134
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
They can't see that.

135
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
They can't see it.

136
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
It's radio.

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I couldn't help it.

138
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I started giggling.

139
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,060
I could be sitting here naked for all the listeners.

140
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,180
You know what happened right there?

141
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,660
They all just pictured me naked.

142
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,900
That's what happened.

143
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
And they did it again!

144
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,620
Anyway, you can join our chat room at IRC.Acheheads.org.

145
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,200

146
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,460
Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

147
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,940
Is this what kind of show we're going to have tonight?

148
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
I mean, honestly.

149
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,660
Well, we had PETA Stokes last week.

150
00:12:11,660 --> 00:11:55,820
You know, 3

151
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,980
Oh, Matt's here.

152
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,840
Matt's Tardy for once.

153
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,540
What kind of...

154
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,180
What punishment do we have for Matt?

155
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
Get the duct tape.

156
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Okay. Anyway, let's...

157
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
Frosted shit.

158
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,180
We can make him drink the cigarette tree out back.

159
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Ewww. Okay.

160
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
We're not going to get into that. Anyway.

161
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
Back to the chatroom.

162
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Back to my fuck you of the week.

163
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
Yes, they know how to join the chatroom by now.

164
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Just channel Orange Lounge, alright?

165
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Let's get into Jamie's F you of the week.

166
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
I have two fuck yous of the week.

167
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,180
The first one goes to my cat, Shermy.

168
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,180
I finally double-a'd Silhouette of My Mind.

169
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,180
I'm sorry, wait a minute. This song just isn't going to work.

170
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,180
If you're going to rant about Shermie...

171
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
Okay, for the Shermie rant.

172
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,180
You know, I'm not, I know I'm not a really great 2DX player.

173
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
You know, I'm getting better.

174
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,180
But I finally PA'd Silhouette of My Mind.

175
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Not PA, why did I say PA?

176
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
I finally double-a'd Silhouette of My Mind.

177
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,180
Shermie walks behind my PlayStation 2 and unplugs it before it saves.

178
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,180
And I haven't been able to do it since I had like three pours and that was driving me crazy.

179
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Now play my pissy music.

180
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Okay.

181
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
Now for my real fuck you of the week.

182
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,180
It goes toward germs and viruses.

183
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I fucking hate them.

184
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
Tuesday, I'm happy.

185
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Dan takes me to RVGL and I'm playing five games of DVR in a row and feeling good and happy and proud of myself.

186
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,180
I wake up Wednesday dead sick.

187
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
And I have been sick.

188
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,180
I thought I was better. I went to go get a Pearl Tea yesterday.

189
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,180
And I nearly passed out at the grocery store, which wasn't fun.

190
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,180
So I'm still not 100% better, damn it, I'm here.

191
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
So, fuck germs. Fuck viruses.

192
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Fuck funguses, too, and allergies while I'm at it.

193
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,180
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode.

194
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
And then I could take over hell.

195
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,180
Well, wasn't that nice?

196
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
I don't mean explode, I mean implode.

197
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,180
It would be a big black hole.

198
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,180
I have an F.U. of the week too, but this is a little silly.

199
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,180
My F.U. of the week is white t-shirts.

200
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Because as you can see, I was eating chocolate ice cream earlier,

201
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,180
and I had it sitting on my lap like the little container of Ben and Jerry's,

202
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,180
and now it looks like someone pooed a perfect circle right on my shirt.

203
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,180
You just don't know it. It's the little man that lives in Rob's ice cream. He pooed on him.

204
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Oh, uh, sorry about that, bro.

205
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,180
It does look like dried shit.

206
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Actually, it looks like someone took that cigarette can you got in your back and someone, like, smeared all that juice right there.

207
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Yes, you can do it. Wait, I...

208
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,180
I don't... Yeah, I do have that. Hold on a minute. I'm getting, uh...

209
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,180
I know I have sexy planet in here somewhere.

210
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,180
You don't get sexy planet, you're going to have to settle for something cool.

211
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,180
What is this? This works fine.

212
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,180
Okay, see, I'm kind of getting, the fuck you of the week is getting a little old,

213
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,180
so I'm going to do a fuck me of the week. Irene, would you fuck me?

214
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Alright! Thank you.

215
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Uh, not right now.

216
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Did the bathroom sit on the hall?

217
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Okay, use the closet.

218
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
I have one thing to say about that.

219
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
That's all, thank you.

220
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
That's what I feel like doing.

221
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,180
I know, it takes me a little time to load the sounds. I'm not super fast.

222
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
Five minutes ago, just call me.

223
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Shut up. Anyway.

224
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Oh, they're already done.

225
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,180
The chat room wants to get in on the fun. I've got another F.U. of the week.

226
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
Uh oh.

227
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:12,180
This one comes from DSCS SoCalKicks. He's been a long time supporter of the show, so I think he deserves a F.U. of the week.

228
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
What song will he give? We'll give him this. We'll give him the dancing pumpkin song.

229
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,180
SoCalKicks gives F.U. because he could not connect to Orange Lounge Radio tonight for quite some time because of his cable internet provider.

230
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,180
So, big F.U. to Cox Cable Internet.

231
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Yeah, they suck cocks!

232
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Cocks sucks cocks.

233
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Hey, if Brad goes through on his offer, you'll be getting cocks cabled pretty soon.

234
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,180
One more hole and she'll have internet access.

235
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,180
I love when this show resorts to potty humor, if I ever mention one.

236
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
Marker...

237
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
No, no, no, my turn, my turn, my turn.

238
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Oh wait, you want Fairy Tail?

239
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Oh wait, this is for Matt? Oh, Matt gets fairy tale.

240
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,180
I thought he had Rainy Men last week.

241
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,180
Yeah, that's true. You got out of Rain Men last time.

242
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Okay, it's very subtle. It's a subtle backdrop to your F.U.

243
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Okay, my minor F.U. of the week goes to last week's show

244
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,180
and the very abruptly cutting off of my rant at the very end of the show

245
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,180
for added humor purposes. I didn't quite like that too much.

246
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
That's all.

247
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Haha.

248
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,180
My response to that?

249
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Bleh.

250
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,180
Did I spit on you?

251
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,180
No, I'm sorry.

252
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
That's okay. Some people would get excited by that.

253
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Whoa, now.

254
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,180
Anyway.

255
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Let's kill the music, shall we?

256
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Any more FUs who are at it?

257
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Because I want to put the nail in the coffin of the FU for this week.

258
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,280
for this week

259
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,960
fuck my shoelaces for coming and i was playing kakame tuesday

260
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,040
how about we say fuck you to the heat

261
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,080
it's a hundred freaking god damn degrees every god damn day of this week

262
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
tall this is an international show now we have people in all different countries

263
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,960
all places the united states listen to this show

264
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,480
in some places the world believe it or not it is cold

265
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
fuck them too

266
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,640
but you know isn't it still typhoon season in japan

267
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
I don't know. Do I look like the weather girl?

268
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,640
My extremate Candace lives in Tokyo and she was telling me about how people like go to work

269
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
during typhoon. Like the wind is 85

270
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
miles an hour. My girlfriend's in Japan and she says it's just really hot.

271
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
I think your girlfriend's just really hot.

272
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Well you're gay so it doesn't matter.

273
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,860
Oh, the cat's out of the bag, Rob.

274
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,860
You don't know me.

275
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
You don't know a thing about me.

276
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
Are you gay?

277
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,860
Wait, let me play that again.

278
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Hey, are you gay?

279
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Yes.

280
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Quite.

281
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:03,740
Oh, I thought that was the whole thing.

282
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
It's just that little bit.

284
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Are you gay?

285
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,580
I'll play Kind Lady next break, Jesus.

286
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,500
All right, let's talk about, as long as we're talking about local stuff, we're talking about

287
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,080
local issues, and one of them being it's fucking hot, and the other one, other interesting

288
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,860
bit of news is that one of our last third Koreans in town, everybody loves a third Korean

289
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,860
the

290
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
is

291
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,360
are one of our last third creens in town finally got upgraded to a max to

292
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,900
it

293
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,880
but what do you what do you think of this that uh... it seems like it seems

294
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,600
like everybody who had a third korean now has a max to or a fifth

295
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,680
like everybody's upgrade the third creams but

296
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you think that's a bad thing, or...?

297
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,680
Well, first of all, Max II kits

298
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,580
are really easy to find for certain reasons that we don't want to accuse

299
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,040
people of.

300
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,460
Bootlegs?

301
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,800
I didn't say it.

302
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,280
No, you go. Well, see, the thing is...

303
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know, I'm not really missing third degree, and I went and tried to play one the

304
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
other day, and now,

305
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,120
forgive me, I started...

306
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,500
I really got playing on fifth makes, I got good on sixth and

307
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,480
better on seventh.

308
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,880
I went back to try to play third. I couldn't see the goddamn arrows for one.

309
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,720
That's your problem.

310
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,240
They do grade harder on third Koreans.

311
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,160
Third Koreans are hella hard.

312
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,240
Obviously you've tried to play SSR.

313
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,920
You probably grew up on that machine and stuff.

314
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,520
But I really don't miss it at all.

315
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,120
Sky was trained on a DDR USA machine.

316
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
You know what?

317
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
I can totally one-up it.

318
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,460
Yeah, I know. I know, girl.

319
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,460
I started on a third mix and played a lot on a 1.5

320
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah, I

321
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,180
I used to play in the bathtub

322
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,140
and uh...

323
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,140
This is about DDR

324
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,360
For Tal here, why don't you call the wambulance?

325
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,020
I swear to god I'm going to fire you from the show, just kidding

326
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,020
I didn't fire him. Fire me? I'm not even getting paid!

327
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Somebody needs to tell Milton that we fired him a year ago.

328
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,020
If you are getting paid, you're just not getting the money.

329
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
You're getting paid in donuts.

330
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh wait, you bought the donuts.

331
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,020
But if they take a stapler, he'll set the building on fire.

332
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
He'll set the building on fire.

333
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
I'm sorry, yes, do you have a comment?

334
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
No.

335
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
Oh, he's...

336
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Somebody brought donuts?

337
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,020
Matt runs out of the room.

338
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:55,020
Well anyways, 3rd VK, it's not really that good of a machine. It's old, it's a nostalgia, it's got gentle strats, strictly business.

339
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,020
But, I mean, really, think about it, the Max 2 has just got so many more songs, so many...

340
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,020
It's new, you know, like the guy keeps saying in 4th Mix over and over.

341
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
It's new!

342
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,020
3rd Korean, excuse me, it is the shit.

343
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,020
It's the poopy!

344
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
We need to bring on our filters.

345
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Oh, you just got hit by the filter.

346
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,020
It's the boopy third Korean is the freaking boopy

347
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,820
I like the third Chris because there's just so many cheesy third mix songs that are just so much more like all the good erotic

348
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,740
Songs were in third mix do it all night. Oh, Nick turn me on

349
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,820
We're all in third base. Although you can play them all in fourth mix. There's something about being able to play like

350
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
What what do I like in third grade starion?

351
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:47,260
I even like the regular third mixes because the third mix has this nostalgic value for

352
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,340
me because it was my first DDR machine.

353
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:57,060
I had been playing on second mix since April 2000.

354
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,780
I had played on the first mix for Playstation in February 2000.

355
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:08,660
I went to Anime Expo and there was this gorgeous looking third mix machine and I freaking saw

356
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,160
I saw SSR the first time and thought I was about to, you know, pee my pants or something.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Jamie does win the award, by the way.

358
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:25,160
For being the most old school. Congratulations.

359
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Yay.

360
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,660
Alright. Sorry, the only fanfare I have is like an hour long, so.

361
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,660
If it counts, I saw DDR in 1999 and thought it looked stupid.

362
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
I was busy playing Bust-A-Move 2.

363
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,380
more play than it ever did. Well, if it got no play and it's gonna get no play now, then

364
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,100
it's never gonna get any play. You didn't make any-

365
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Oh, sure, inject your logic into everything.

366
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,980
You're not gonna get any play. You get no dub. No dub from me.

367
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
You know.

368
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Yes.

369
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:33,820
I, I, I'm, see, the machine, everyone's gonna attach their own value, everyone has their

370
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,740
favorite mix. Like, I still think to this day my favorite overall would have to be second.

371
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,240
Yes. Why? Oh, I know why.

372
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Because it has freaking battle mode.

373
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
That's step battle, yes.

374
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Step battle owns.

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Oh, they are warning you. Some of the locals that chat in the chatroom mat are warning you, no memory card slots at Folsom Game Room. Sorry.

376
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Duh.

377
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:07,240
One thing I do have to say that I like for the mixes after third is that the old third mixes had the memory card slots in the back of the machines.

378
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I remember.

379
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I don't remember ever seeing one of those.

380
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I thought they had them in the back of the machine.

381
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Ouch.

382
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I don't remember.

383
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
They're asking us, are you guys okay there?

384
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
You get situated?

385
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Are you getting a little too hanky-panky back there or something?

386
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I remember hearing that older mixes had them in the back of the machines.

387
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Someone in the chat room is asking about the battle mode that was in fourth mix.

388
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Well, it's not in kona mix, and that battle mode is different from the one that was step

389
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
battle in second mix.

390
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,240
The step battle in Second Mix had blocks of arrows go up where both players go and, well, shut the hell up.

391
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Ah, they're just messing with us in the chat room.

392
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:59,240
The step battle was this different feature in Second Mix. A lot of people haven't seen it, but what it was, basically, you could dance a particular pattern and then your opponent had to dance that too, right?

393
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah, basically you would have all four arrows but they would be basically clear.

394
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,560
They would come up in a particular pattern and you would follow that pattern stepping

395
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,280
on whatever you wanted to, you know, of course you could do more than two arrows at a time.

396
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,200
And then they would come up red for the ones that you picked and blue for the ones that

397
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,060
your opponent picked but you still had to dance them all.

398
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Very cool.

399
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,500
And it can get intense, you know, you have to be really good at sight reading.

400
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,460
So out of 2nd Mix's Step Battle, 3rd Mix's Unison, and 4th Mix's Battle, what was the

401
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,740
best?

402
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,660
The one that was in Disney's Rave Home Version.

403
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
No, I, was that adoption?

404
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:44,100
No, there was A, B, and C. There was no D. C. I didn't really like, because I played

405
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,700
a 2nd Mix and I guess maybe I just couldn't hear it or something, but it was like, I didn't

406
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
get it.

407
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,500
I was just like, what the hell is going on?

408
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,620
What the hell is Unison Mode?

409
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,980
I never ever figured that out.

410
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,460
the Unison mode was you had one set of arrows in the middle of the screen, and you both

411
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,060
had to dance the green ones, and then one person had to do the red ones.

412
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,300
Oh, I played that. It's like the battle mode, but it was harder because it was only one

413
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,980
set going up the middle. You got it.

414
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,420
Hey, they're gonna fight! That was the best part about Fourth Mix's

415
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,700
battle, was it goes, they're gonna fight! And then, like, if you're in an arcade where

416
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,740
the machine's turned up really loud and the announcer says that, you'll get a bunch of

417
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,020
those kids that call DDR gay and stuff, they'll turn around and go, what?

418
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,380
I remember playing the one on third mix, me and my girlfriend tried to do Jam Jam Reggae

419
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,380
Maniac.

420
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,760
Now, Jam Jam Reggae Maniac is hella hard to begin with, especially when it's flat and

421
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,460
the colors are all weird, and we tried it and we had no idea how to play a unison mode

422
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,940
to begin with, so it was like, what the fuck, they're red and green and blue!

423
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,160
I stand corrected, the arrows that both people have to dance to are actually yellow, green

424
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,300
was fourth mixes.

425
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,820
I actually do think that I like the one in fourth mix better overall, but still for purely

426
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,820
nostalgic value. The second mix, Battle Mode, was really fun. It's that battle.

427
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,920
Oh, you'd like this suggestion we're getting in the chatroom, Jamie. Jabberwocky wants

428
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,020
to make a DDR Puyo Puyo mix game. Now, actually, if I'm not mistaken, there is a Bahmani Puyo

429
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,780
Puyo game, correct? It's not Bahmani. Well, okay, I'm sorry, yeah. It's not Bahmani. It's

430
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:15,940
Bahmani-like. I can't believe it's not Bahmani. It basically plays almost exactly like Parappa,

431
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,140
Where you have your, I mean the pattern is a little bit more complex, but you have your

432
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,540
patterns come up and you know your characters dance to it.

433
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,140
For those that don't know what Puyo Puyo is, it's probably best known in the states as

434
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Kirby's Avalanche.

435
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,740
Puyo Pop for Game Boy Advance.

436
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,220
Or did they have a Sonic version of it too on Sega, didn't they have a Sega Puyo Puyo

437
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Puyo?

438
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Mean Machine.

439
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Thank you.

440
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,980
And yes, I do own that version too.

441
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,820
I have all kinds of versions of Puyo Puyo, but that's besides the point.

442
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,100
Okay, we've talked about some old school

443
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,960
Bamani stuff. Let's talk about some new school.

444
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,660
If that's a term I can use, new school.

445
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,900
Uh, DDR Max USA, some slight new news on it. I mean, this was

446
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,940
something I kind of already been assumed,

447
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,940
but it has been confirmed by Konami of America.

448
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,920
We are going to have license tracks in Max USA, and not only are they licensed,

449
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,740
they're going to be exclusive.

450
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,100
So that means they're new.

451
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,540
It's new!

452
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,180
On top of that, there's really not much else to add until we get further announcements.

453
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,860
I think Max is still, what, about three months out for USA, so we'll probably be getting

454
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
some more songs in the next few weeks.

455
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,740
Did you have something to say?

456
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,620
Oh, I thought you were raising your hand.

457
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,860
Anybody want to comment on that news?

458
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,500
Isn't it coming out in November, or was it October?

459
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,980
I don't remember, really.

460
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I'm just waiting to play something like Sonoma Lette.5 speed, you know?

461
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Is it going to replace our USA machine at RVGL, do you know?

462
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
It's a home version.

463
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,980
It's not an arcade machine, it's a home version.

464
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,980
And by the way, just my own little happy New Bay Money news, in five weeks I'll have my 2DX controller.

465
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:07,980
But yeah, there's no Konami of America arcade unit anymore, so there isn't going to be any upgrades, ever.

466
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,380
Not true, not true.

467
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,860
They still could distribute through their third party distributor, whoever they're going

468
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
to team up with.

469
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,660
We don't know what direction that's going to take it.

470
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,420
It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing, but probably going to be a good thing.

471
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,980
We just don't know, so it's too early to say.

472
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,340
All we've got on the front now, though, is this new home version.

473
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
It will be special.

474
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,900
Okay, anyone else want to say anything about Max USA coming up?

475
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
No.

476
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,340
I mean, we just don't know a lot.

477
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
It's new!

478
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
It's new!

479
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,100
And that's about all we can say to it right now.

480
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,540
I'm hoping we can get some interviews in the future on this show with people that can tell

481
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
us more.

482
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
But we'll see.

483
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,740
We'll see if they'll even call us or if they'll even talk to us.

484
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,660
Who are you?

485
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,340
What is this Orange Lounge show?

486
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,420
What I always do that works is you poison them first and then you say if you want like

487
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,180
the antidote then you gotta like do the interview.

488
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Stop it.

489
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Anyway.

490
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,720
Also new, new school, Euromix 2.

491
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,060
It's pretty much from what I'm hearing, it's Max 2 without everything good in it.

492
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,820
Like Oni modes and...

493
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,180
The interface is so freaked up, it's not even funny.

494
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,780
Actually there is a pretty decent review of it on the DDR Freakboards in the United Kingdom

495
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
forum.

496
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,860
Really nice review, first hand experience.

497
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,340
Which I believe links to another site called...

498
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,180
I think it's musicgames.com.

499
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,380
I don't remember the site of it.

500
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:41,280
Dancing Games, thank you, it's dancinggames.com, which is, I believe, a Euro-based site.

501
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,700
Something like that, they'll tell us.

502
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,080
Pretty much, it's Max 2 without the Onis, without any unlocks that we know of.

503
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,780
Moreover, it's got the thing where you have to pick your difficulty after you pick the song,

504
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,620
but it doesn't tell you the difficulty beforehand.

505
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,260
Yep, no groove meter.

506
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,500
And it's like USA, where you have to pick the song first, and then you'll pick the difficulty.

507
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:18,500
It's got some ridiculous looking, I mean the song selection looks really cool though, and it's got some of the Oni mode songs it already unlocked to be able to play, like His Area, and I forget which other ones, but I mean think about it, you can play the new songs with three levels of difficulty, and none of them are actual Oni difficulty level, I would think.

508
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I'm being corrected on the site, that's actually DanceGames.com is the name of the site, so yeah, we were close enough, alright.

509
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:36,500
So that'll be interesting to hear more about. There's all sorts of new songs in there. You get to dance now to Nick Carter in Steps. Isn't that amazing?

510
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Oh, I'm sorry, Aaron Carter. Nick's the one that's actually a Backstreet Boy, huh?

511
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Does the excitement ever start?

512
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:51,500
From what I haven't heard much about the Steps, but I guess it's nothing too special or we would have heard more about them.

513
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I'm sure we'll see them for The Sims pretty soon, so we'll have to wait for those.

514
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,080
Good deal good deal and for those of you who have been dying to dance to this song

515
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
For those who have been dying to dance to this

516
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
Kylie Minogue can't get you out of my head

517
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,940
The dancing stage party for the euro

518
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,540
Playstations will have

519
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,040
Can't get you out of my head by Kylie Minogue along with other songs an unknown bloodhound gang song

520
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I know is on the list

521
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,220
We don't know but if you've ever just been dying to dance to those songs

522
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,420
Thank you, so that'll be coming out soon, and I haven't heard much about that. I guess it's

523
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,520
Supposedly some kind of oh Matt seems to know

524
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,040
Oh, it's got the nice new shiny cabinet. Oh, you're talking about the home version.

525
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Yes, the home version.

526
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,600
I'm sorry. Now, I saw pictures of the new EuroMix cabinet. It doesn't look any different

527
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
at all to me.

528
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,960
It's just like a darker silver chrome color.

529
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Ooh.

530
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,600
Well, it's got hardware upgrades supposedly.

531
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Oh, okay.

532
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
No one really seems to know.

533
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Well, that's cool.

534
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
But apparently EuroMix 2 doesn't use it.

535
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Huh?

536
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,080
Well, EuroMix 2 is basically a dumbed-down Max 2 with some new songs.

537
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,560
Well, it's got a lot more songs on it, which means more stupid videos in the background.

538
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,560
And who knows, maybe actual videos from the actual songs, you know, like Aaron Carter, crap.

539
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:29,560
But the home version thing, I'm still saying that I'm jealous because, you know, the Europeans have two exclusive mixes with licensed songs in them,

540
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,560
whereas we had two regurgitated pieces of shit, and now we're finally getting some new shit. So what's up with that?

541
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Well, I guess the whole theory is, though, is to get the new shit, you have to play the old shit, basically.

542
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,800
basically, is that they've got to prove that the old shit's successful to invest money

543
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
in the new shit, basically.

544
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah, but that's not the point.

545
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,480
Like, Konami didn't want to spend, because licenses in America are expensive. I mean,

546
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,600
look at how much they're charging internet radio off the rest of the place.

547
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Oh, it's called a radio ambulance.

548
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Well, you know, it's expensive, though.

549
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,480
Well, I point out to you also, when we're talking about licenses, Britney's Dance Beat

550
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,640
has only five songs on it. Five songs, that's all they could afford to put on the damn game.

551
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,080
So basically it's a matter of at least- Who would buy a Britney Spears game anyway?

552
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,360
Because it's by the time- Well it's a good half an hour long rental.

553
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:23,920
But I still would not pay money for anything with Britney Spears in it because my money

554
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,340
is worth more than your tits and ass I guess.

555
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,440
Basically the bottom line on why we get recycled stuff is basically it's kind of like, I guess

556
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,520
it's kind of having to prove yourself.

557
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,000
I think a lot of folks at the Konami of Japan who kind of have the rights all the DDR stuff

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,280
They don't really believe they laugh at ours kind of taken off

559
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,740
They let them like in every well

560
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,320
Let's release this and see how it does over there and then now that it's doing well

561
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,440
It's like okay

562
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,440
We'll give more of the rights and let you license your own stuff and spend the money on that and all that stuff. So

563
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,380
Yes, I'm being also mentioned in the chat room saying radio stations give out million-dollar prizes. They have money not this one

564
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,640
I pay to do this show. You can give me a dollar. If you want to send us money, hey

565
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,120
great, maybe we'll set up a PayPal thing, I don't know. Yes. Send us a dollar of

566
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,520
nine and you get a vanilla coke. Yeah, I couldn't get it. Anyway, so we'll see. As soon as we get more news on

567
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,120
Max USA, we'll definitely give it over to you guys. Also new, being location tested.

568
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,880
We talked about this last week on the show a little bit. 8th Style is brand new and it's

569
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,240
being location tested in Japan right now. And some of the MP3s got leaked, but they

570
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,720
were kind of bad quality. However, now we've got some very good quality 2DX 8th Style MP3s

571
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,400
that have been leaked to the internet and they've just spread around like a bad case

572
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,120
of an aerial disease. They're all over now. But in case you haven't heard them yet, I'm

573
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
going to play them for you right now.

574
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,720
Some of them are very surprising.

575
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,720
And they're all really good, in my personal opinion.

576
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,720
They sound a lot like the stuff that came out of BeatMania VI plus CoreRemix and a lot

577
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,620
of the same artists as there, such as like my favorite Pink Pong and athletics and such.

578
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,760
A lot of the new songs I like a lot, but most BeatMania purists, I guess, aren't very fond

579
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
of the way it is.

580
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,980
Well, we shall see.

581
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,380
Let's see what the chat room thinks of these.

582
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm going to play three songs in this break from 2DX, 8th style.

583
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,160
We're going to hear, starting off, Tiger Yamato with V35, and then we're going to hear Mr.

584
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,680
Tea with Airflow, and we'll hear Pink Pong with Star Dreams, so I'm going to play those

585
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
three for you.

586
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,160
We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back to talk about 8th Style here on Orange

587
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,160
lounge radio.

588
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,160
["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]

589
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
Oh

590
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:26,340
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

591
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:33,420
sedation live with Travis Ron and Jessica Saturdays 630 p.m. till 930 p.m.

592
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,420
Pacific Standard Time at understudationlive.org

593
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,860
What's going on?

594
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Jamie doing a little reprise of the chicken

595
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
there.

596
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,420
I think he just blew out somebody's speaker there.

597
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,020
It's a chicken getting raped, dude.

598
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:29,420
You just heard three songs brand new, just all over the internet like a wildfire this

599
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,420
week.

600
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,420
They're shiny.

601
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
They're shiny spanking new.

602
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,500
First we hear Tiger Yamato with V35, second was Mr. T with Airflow, and lastly, Pink Pong

603
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,300
with Stardream.

604
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,200
A little promo for that other show on Saturday nights, understudationlive.org, a fun little

605
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,900
program I've participated in, and Jamie participates in quite frequently lately.

606
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,060
Yeah, I'm the number one guest.

607
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,940
Last night was a very neat show because for the first time, Travis played, during one

608
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,900
of the breaks, a 2DX song, which is very scary if you know Travis because he really just

609
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,700
I think Spamani people are dorks, but in a good way.

610
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,600
Never look back.

611
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,580
Which is a cool song.

612
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,500
Because it's goth.

613
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,920
It is a cool song, I agree.

614
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,740
But that's a fun show, and if you like what we do here, you should definitely

615
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,000
tune into that.

616
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,360
It's super fun.

617
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,700
I don't know how else to explain it, really.

618
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,480
Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice.

619
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,920
Anyway, going back to 2DX8 style,

620
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,800
what do y'all think of the music?

621
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,740
What do you think of 8rd style so far?

622
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:38,980
It's special, and shiny, and I'm sorry, but that one Tiger Yamato track freakin' sounds

623
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,420
like it's Taka.

624
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,820
You think maybe somebody messed up on the labeling?

625
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,820
I don't know, but it sounds like Taka.

626
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,620
They're probably all the same people.

627
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,820
They're all Naoki.

628
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,820
Well yeah!

629
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,160
I mean, the one thing that surprised me of course about the list so far, and I do realize

630
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,160
This is only a test location list, so obviously not everything that's going to be new to 8th

631
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,200
Style has been leaked to the internet yet.

632
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,500
No TAC yet, which is kind of surprising, which is a crime, but we're just thinking he's taking

633
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,400
a little summer vacation and he'll be back.

634
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,940
I made him a money funny.

635
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,440
That wasn't a real D-slapper, huh?

636
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
Anyway.

637
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,760
No, no, no, no, there cannot be a 2DX without my man in it.

638
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,520
I'm being told that also, now I thought this was rumor, but it's being brought up again,

639
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,000
MAX 3 is supposedly location testing too, but from what I had heard, somebody actually

640
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,880
that's in Japan that posts on some of the message boards locally went to the arcade

641
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,260
that's supposedly location test and didn't see it.

642
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,400
So I bet it's probably one of those cases where like it's going to be really soon, we're

643
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,280
going to start hearing the MAX 3 location test, if it's not already out, but we haven't

644
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,320
I haven't heard anything yet.

645
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,780
But anyway, 2DX8 style, location testing.

646
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,440
To me, it sounds very much like 5-key music.

647
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,720
And obviously that's a big duh, because they're both B-Media, and a lot of the 5-key artists

648
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,160
now that B-Media the final is gone don't really have a resource, so they're going to have

649
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,260
to go to 2DX to put their songs in.

650
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,400
I think it kind of sounds a lot like the music in 6, plus core to me.

651
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,400
Way off topic here since you mentioned Max 3.

652
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:27,400
I heard actually that one of the songs, Crash, that's going to be on Max 3 is actually a heavy metal song, which is kind of cool.

653
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,400
That would be interesting. But back to 8th Style, think about it.

654
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,400
It's just like a lot of the Keyboard Mania 4th Mix rumored thing.

655
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:43,400
A lot of those artists were saved and brought into 6th Style, like Frozen Ray, and a bunch of other 6th Style songs that you know should have been Keyboard Mania but aren't.

656
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,080
Yeah, that was always kind of my thought, especially if you, uh, the one song, Deutz

657
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,240
de Fatima by Usama Kaboda, does not douche de Fatima, is that what you're calling it?

658
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
Is it really?

659
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,920
I thought it was, douche de, whatever it's called.

660
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
If it's real French, it's droits.

661
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
It's droits?

662
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,680
It's like, uh, droits de Fatima.

663
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,320
Droits de Fatima, whatever.

664
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Whatever the hell it's called.

665
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,440
Y'all know what song I'm talking about by this one.

666
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,200
It's the one that goes, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.

667
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,320
That song does not sound like ever a 2DX song ever, but it sounds like keyboard mania,

668
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:19,320
The reason why I think it's French, by the way, is because that's French for right.

669
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,320
But Fatima is Portuguese and Latin for marry.

670
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
I figure out what it is.

671
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
I figure out what it is.

672
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,320
It's just a bunch of languages and they butchered them all and they stuck them in one together

673
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
and fucking shit.

674
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,320
Cock, cunt, suck, ball.

675
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Give me that.

676
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,320
What ever happened to the actual licensed songs that they were talking about for AIDS

677
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,320
style, like Daft Punk and that kind of stuff?

678
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Don't know.

679
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,820
location test. Location tests don't usually have licensed songs in them, so we don't know.

680
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,800
But yeah, Team Guilo, before they went down, they were rumored to put on Aphex Twin's Girl

681
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,040
Boy song as one of the test songs for 8 style, and if that is true, then I would die, because

682
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,220
that's one of the coolest songs ever. I think they took somebody's little files for their

683
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,480
home version and stuck it in the arcade to test it.

684
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,480
How they tested the 8 style? How they got those MP3s?

685
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
I was joking.

686
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
Oh.

687
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,480
Yeah?

688
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,480
Uh-huh.

689
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,480
Uh-huh.

690
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Uh-huh, funny.

691
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,480
Anyway, whatever.

692
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,480
Uh, it would be interesting to see those songs turn up in the 8 style.

693
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,480
I don't know, the list, when I saw the list, I was like, this is a little bit too good to be true.

694
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,480
But if B-mini is as big as they say in Japan, maybe it's starting to get the attention of bigger A-list artists.

695
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,480
They need more happy hardcore.

696
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,480
I really have nothing to say about that.

697
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,480
Well, then why did you take the microphone, honestly?

698
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Because she knew you'd take it eventually.

699
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,480
Dude, he's such a mic whore.

700
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,480
We're going to have to get him a little headset like Matt had the first two weeks.

701
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Well, thank you for calling, Orange Lounge. May you help me?

702
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,480
I'll just have to put you on hold until you can learn to speak in a more professional manner.

703
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Yes, you worked in the call center for two years.

704
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,480
2DX8 style, what else did I want to say about it?

705
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
It's special!

706
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,480
It's special! It's new!

707
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,480
It makes me tingle.

708
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Down there?

709
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,480
Nope.

710
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,480
That's what the show's for.

711
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,480
Is it, like, golden blue? Or head and shoulders?

712
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,480
It makes my scalp sparkle.

713
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,480
How about any other songs you guys liked, for those of you that have heard all of the 8 style tracks?

714
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Dancer's pretty fucking cool.

715
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,480
Cool.

716
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Yay.

717
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Dancer rules.

718
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,480
Yeah.

719
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,960
Because it's like something you'd expect more in like a Tar Freak Stromania, but it kind

720
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,780
of reminds me of Kiriyama Oka's Diamond Jealousy, which I really like.

721
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
So yeah.

722
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
Way to go.

723
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
Whoo.

724
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,780
Yay.

725
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,780
As long as we don't hit.

726
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,780
Meltdown.

727
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Meltdown.

728
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
Whoo.

729
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
Just a bunch more Eurobeat.

730
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,780
Because, you know, I thought the sixth style was, you know, 2DX Para Para edition.

731
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,780
Wait.

732
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,780
You want this?

733
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,500
I don't know if I should hit the keys or, you know, start waving my hands around.

734
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
Huh?

735
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
What?

736
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,500
We have taunting going on.

737
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,500
The new Naoki song actually sounded really good.

738
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:11,500
I forget. It's the one that's got him with some other chick who's not one of the dive...

739
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
It's not Polteri.

740
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Yeah, it sounds a lot like dive, but it's really cool.

741
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
And everybody cheers. It's not Polteri.

742
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,500
It's actually a really good song, surprisingly enough.

743
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,500
And it's what I think Before You song should sound like, even though she's not a B4...

744
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,700
ooh, my terrier phone's going off. Bye bye.

745
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,860
Uh, the song in the background, Youthful Urges, also known as Blue Impulse, that is the

746
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,140
Naoki- Youthful Urges, huh? For once!

747
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,540
He ditched Politary and went with somebody named Yuki.

748
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,380
Nooo!

749
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,980
I'm not starting the Politary debate again on this show.

750
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
As long as it's not voluntary, I'm a happy girl.

751
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,980
Big surprise.

752
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,980
What, yes?

753
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,980
Big surprise. All the voluntary songs are going to be on 8th style.

754
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,980
And you're going to have to play at least one of them for each game.

755
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,980
They won't let you pick anything except for one of the voluntary songs.

756
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,980
You know how the list changes?

757
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,980
The first song is like a small list and after you pick the first one, the first song is just going to be all voluntary.

758
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,980
Sorry, Rob.

759
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,980
That's too bad.

760
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,980
That's when I swallow the microphone hole and die.

761
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I'm going to choke on this microphone right now.

762
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,380
Whatever happened, weren't they supposed to get another chick for Dive?

763
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,140
Like, when DDR Max came out, you know how Dive has four people, weren't they going to get a fifth person?

764
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,580
Whatever happened with that?

765
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,140
Politei killed her.

766
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,100
I guess somebody realized, oh, Dive...

767
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,940
I'm sorry, what the hell am I saying? I'm sorry, a fifth girl for Dive. I'm talking B for you,

768
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:48,460
not Dive. B for you sings Dive. B for you. They were supposed to get a fifth chick and B for you.

769
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,060
And that didn't happen.

770
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,660
all terry's sculptor were her scalp

771
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,300
and just like certain scene

772
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,060
the reason i thought that one person had left

773
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,660
and they got a replacement that would make it to four again right

774
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,300
yeah i think that's actually what happened at the end i thought that now

775
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,940
he would just cross-dressed

776
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,860
does everybody in things that he's a woman anyway

777
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,260
did not unsighted

778
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,060
now he's pretty good it is a woman

779
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,620
now he is a very pretty

780
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,780
now keep

781
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,200
it down to use about us and the u s is the act was what is that what they did

782
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,140
anything to do

783
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,520
as i get to know this

784
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,060
this in the chair of his life

785
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:31,420
there's a line here and i think what is that i mean he's got a party

786
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,200
a line here in the chair and this would be a great only course

787
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,940
mail key

788
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,400
not featuring polyteria

789
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,320
yes

790
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,700
that would be the best i was not a course ever

791
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:47,700
i was dark it's really a are friends i'm sorry dt you like our winter now

792
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,060
i got an idea about the

793
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,580
military course not featuring a key it'll just be her singing

794
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,100
no music nothing

795
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,700
got that we can i get a lot of how terrible she is players worst

796
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,940
hahahahaha

797
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,180
winner

798
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,340
many lives are actually now that's what

799
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,020
just you know if you go to a max to machine a lot of people don't try to

800
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,220
speak it both arrows will resort the list

801
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,940
and one of the last sorts is players' best, but they need to have a players' worst, seriously,

802
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,460
to play those songs that nobody ever plays.

803
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,980
Well, they're right next to the players' best, you know, very top-

804
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,340
It's like the, you know, the skanky pieces at the bottom of the septic tank.

805
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:27,380
That works on fifth mix, but if I recall right, Max and Max 2 only show the top 30. Actually,

806
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,700
Max will show everything. Max 2 will only show the top 30. If I recall correctly...

807
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,700
I don't know what I wrote, Chef, anyway.

808
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,700

821
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,100
bongo we must marry

822
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,100
i will allow you to date with me

823
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,700
i have to go smite brad now

824
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Ah, I swear to god.

825
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Because Bongo demands it!

826
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,380
hope we just had one drop but i think they have to say it

827
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,180
recently

828
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,260
we needed a guy that but that only works last week here

829
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,600
speaking of which all that does make me think though t r p c

830
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,820
i got to play it a little more

831
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,500
and unlocks a new we're talking last week about hacking the characters

832
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,600
some new characters that are unlocked in t r p c there's a character

833
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,420
called brother

834
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
who's uh... uh...

835
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:38,420
He's a cross between Shaft and Jam Jam Reggae, pretty much, the whole little Reggae hat thing, and his name is Brother. He's a brother.

836
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,420
Brother.

837
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,420
And then the other unlockable characters are Ruby and Sapphire, which are pretty much, they kind of look like...

838
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,420
Aren't those Sailor Moon characters or something?

839
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,420
I'm not sure.

840
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,420
No.

841
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,420
But it looks like a...

842
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,420
I wonder if there's a Ruby Moon in Cardiac Resatra.

843
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:58,340
Kind of looks like a cowboy and a cowgirl. Ruby and Sapphire is kind of what they look

844
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,180
like. Sapphire is a boy.

845
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,320
It's Frankie! And then one of the other unlockable characters

846
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,540
is pink haired Emmy. Or, not Emmy, pink haired lady.

847
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,900
Lovely. She's from Second Mix or something.

848
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,380
I know your girl. Oh, if you're in the chatroom right now,

849
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,800
SoCalKicks on his lovely little site at SoCalKicks.com has some articles with pictures if you want

850
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:25,800
to go see. I know that because I gave him the picture of Brother. And Angel Zukin.

851
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,360
And actually speaking of SoCal Kicks, I think it's about time for me to once again repeat

852
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,560
the challenge.

853
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,000
Alright, go for it. Why not?

854
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Both my edits can be found on his page, I hope still. If not, send an email to orangeloungelounge.com.

855
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,400
OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com, all one word.

856
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,360
And I will get you the dex files for it for my Look to the Sky edit called Free Fall.

857
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:01,620
Whoever the first person to send me proof, excuse me, Mr. SoCalKicks, that is full comboed

858
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:07,320
with at least a double A, you will get a nice, lovely GameCube pin that I actually put on

859
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,400
display on my webcam on DDR Freak.

860
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:19,140
And whoever can either full combo or AA another edit for DXY, you will be taken out to dinner

861
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,140
for me.

862
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,140
Or at least get a...

863
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,140
From me.

864
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,140
Dinner.

865
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,140
Dinner.

866
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,140
Dinner.

867
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,140
Dinner for you.

868
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,020
Dinner for you.

869
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:33,180
And if you're not in the area, I'll try to send you a gift certificate or something.

870
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,940
Also I've noticed SoCon kicks your email address that's on your site there doesn't work.

871
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,900
So I can't send you edits.

872
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,860
I want to send you edits, but I can't, so please fix.

873
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,460
Thank you.

874
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,900
He'll be kind enough to send me his email through a private message.

875
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,980
God damn it, Tal, you're sitting on the mic cord.

876
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,980
Ah, that's a shot of Tal I never wanted to see right there.

877
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,200
Are you OK?

878
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,980
Hello.

879
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,540
Did you hurt yourself?

880
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,260
I think we have an injury.

881
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,500
Do you need a Band-Aid?

882
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,340
You need some vodka?

883
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,660
What do you need?

884
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,500
I'm OK.

885
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Alright, I'm okay.

886
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,000
SoCalKick, send me a private message with your email and I'll make sure Matt gets it so he can...

887
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Because Matt has an ass-load of edits. There's really no other way to describe it. He just has an ass-load of edits.

888
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Dude, he's got, like, JLo's leftover ass of edits.

889
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,500
Like, everything they took off of Ricky Lake, he's got in edits.

890
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
I just can't show.

891
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
That was funny.

892
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Anyway...

893
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,500
That was wrong.

894
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Anyway, why don't we take a break now?

895
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Gee, break!

896
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Uh, what did I say I was gonna play this break? Oh, I said I'd play Jack and Mark Get Busy.

897
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Yes.

898
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,500
And, uh, let's do another 8-style song. Um, how about...

899
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,500
No, I wanna do, uh...

900
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
What'd we get for the Naoki one?

901
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Let's do Rainbow... Oh, we wanna do the Naoki song? Why not?

902
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
Why not?

903
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
We'll get that in there and, uh, some other crap.

904
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Yeah.

905
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
So enjoy.

906
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Well, we take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

907
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:29,320
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we never

908
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:44,200
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock This is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate

909
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
As we demonstrate

910
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
Straight, straight, straight

911
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,200
This the sounds

912
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
This the sounds

913
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
Everybody wants some peace, so goodbye

914
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Don't tell me that Mr. I

915
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,200
Don't tell me that I do the fight

916
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Cause I, she's my, image fly

917
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,100
this is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

918
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:40,300
this is the way we ride as we demonstrate

919
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Yeah!

920
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Woo!

921
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,300
Yeah!

922
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,300
Yeah!

923
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,140
Yeah!

924
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,600
Yeah!

925
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
Yeah

926
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:19,100
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

927
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,360
the Orange Lounge Re-Money Music and More show?

928
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:28,880
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

929
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,120
It's unearthly.

930
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,380
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

931
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,480
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and-

932
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,120
That was a man who never gets laid.

933
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:44,840
And that set, by request in studio, was Jack and Mark Get Busy from Beatmania 6.

934
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,720
And then some more 2DX8-style stuff.

935
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,840
All over the internet this week, Lab and Dancer, two of the songs from 2DX8.

936
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,000
And the chat room, they seem to think Lab's okay.

937
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,680
Don't really care for Dancer, though.

938
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,600
They disagree with Brad and Irene in that respect.

939
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,920
But Brad and Irene went home, so they are not here to defend themselves.

940
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,640
So I guess the chat room wins that one.

941
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,560
So I can say this, Politary Sucks!

942
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,560
I hate her!

943
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Die!

944
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
Die!

945
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
Die!

946
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:20,140
Also, we're kind of by ourselves now.

947
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,100
We've got Bradley in here, but he's eating food, so he's not going to be saying anything,

948
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,600
but they all ran outside to go get pizza, so it's okay.

949
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,060
Yay for pizza.

950
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,060
Thank you.

951
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,060
Yay for pizza.

952
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,060
It smells good.

953
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,060
Yes.

954
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,100
And this Yay for Pizza was brought to you by Propel Water, put out by Gatorade.

955
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:40,940
And I was going to let Matt give a sim update, but he left to go get pizza, so now I'm stuck

956
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,940
with nothing.

957
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,940
We'll have to tell potty jokes.

958
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:47,900
We'll give the sim update, you know, you can, the best way to kill sims is to put them in

959
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,420
a pool and remove the ladder.

960
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:54,100
I'm being sent files, I don't know if this is a good thing or not, we'll find out here.

961
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:59,300
You can also teach sims how to barbecue, and then if you give them a low personality rating,

962
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,940
when they set themselves on fire, nobody will come to help them.

963
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,720
I would love to know what SoCalKick sent me this file for.

964
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,140
It's a picture of his cable provider or something.

965
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,140
Are they exploding?

966
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,140
No, not yet.

967
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,140
This is his picture.

968
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,140
Look at...

969
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,140
Geez.

970
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,140
I don't know.

971
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,140
Anyway.

972
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,180
It's a thingy.

973
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,660
You want to give any more shout outs to any of your friends that are listening?

974
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Um...

975
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,940
New Orange Lounge Radio Converts.

976
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,020
I see some new faces in the chat room tonight.

977
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,020
Very cool.

978
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:36,020
have a look. Hi people! Hello people in the chat room! You're so cute! I just want to

979
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:45,100
eat them all up! There's some fava beans and a fine chianti. There's some fanboys who might

980
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:51,100
take you up on that. Tell us about your trip you're going to be taking soon, if you can.

981
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:57,700
You can tell us about your trip, can't you? Basically, a whole bunch of us from DDR Freak

982
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:05,220
are going to be in Vegas the weekend after so if you see you know a short

983
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:09,260
girl wearing glasses come out of the Star Trek experience all fucked up that

984
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,700
is the best place to get drunk in Vegas by the way you'll know who had you know

985
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,060
you're a geek when that was you know sad but true that was the first place I ever

986
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,540
got really fucked up was at the Star Trek experience on a warp core breach

987
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:25,420
which for those who don't know for those that don't know seven different kinds of

988
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,340
Bacardi, Sobe, and Razzmatazz, all mixed in a fish bowl.

989
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,920
And some really freakin' good juices mixed in with it, too.

990
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,260
And dry ice.

991
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:37,620
So Jamie will not, unfortunately, be with us in a couple weeks, but we will somehow

992
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,420
survive and the show will go on.

993
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,500
Who knows, maybe I'll be the one.

994
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,640
Matt's been dying to co-host a show, and I think he's been here every week since week

995
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,640
one.

996
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,640
Why not?

997
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,640
We'll let Matt co-host a show for once.

998
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,640
Oh, speak, oh, Matt's back!

999
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,660
Hey, Matt, wanna give us a Sim update?

1000
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,660
Are you too busy?

1001
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:59,660
Swallow that, swallow!

1002
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:06,660
Anyways, as of today, there's a new DWI that just came out. I believe it's 2.01.

1003
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Supposedly fixed some stuff. One thing they added is percentages on the score screen.

1004
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,660
So if you hit the upper left button, I believe it should put up percentages.

1005
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:24,660
and very happy for me as they doubled the capacity that the Sim can handle.

1006
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,660
So before it used to handle 1,024 songs, which I was getting kind of close there,

1007
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,660
now it can hold 2,048.

1008
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,660
And for those that don't believe him, I will vouch for this.

1009
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:38,660
His Sim has so many freaking songs in it, it was damn near pushing that number, yes.

1010
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:42,660
So that's pretty much what's going on there.

1011
01:09:42,660 --> 01:10:11,660
Another thing that's pretty cool is DDR Maniacs, I think I might have mentioned it last week, is doing the user submitted files now, and one of the files that they have on there is Ooh La La from Dancing Stage 1-5, the beta I believe, and it was one of the original songs that was going to be on Dancing Stage Euromix that was actually going to have three arrows at one time on there, or four, I can't remember, I haven't played it yet, but that was actually going to be one of the songs that was supposed to be on DDR a long time ago.

1012
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,660
What happened? It just didn't make it in DDR?

1013
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,660
It just didn't make it. There was three songs that got cut.

1014
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:21,660
I believe there was one by Run DMC also. They all got cut.

1015
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,660
Interesting.

1016
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:25,660
And Team Gwylo is still down. Very sad.

1017
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:30,660
And that also means that DDR PC Central is also down for the melting pot.

1018
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:33,660
A moment of silence please. Thank you.

1019
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:39,660
And also, Trini Mix 2 on DDR East Coast Invasion.

1020
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:44,660
You'll probably start seeing the files pretty soon because they said they're releasing them on the 15th, so probably this week.

1021
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:49,660
Cool! Well, the 15th is this week, so that would make sense.

1022
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,660
Alright, that's it.

1023
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,660
Thank you for that lovely update on the sim scene.

1024
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,660
Back to potty jokes. Poop! Anyway...

1025
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,660
Oh, ass!

1026
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:05,660
Somebody suggested a good idea in the chat room that maybe you want to beg and plead anybody that might be coming through Sacramento

1027
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:09,980
I know that's going to the big tournament in Concord this weekend. You know about your situation

1028
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:18,100
Well, if anybody can give me a ride to Concord. Hey, I'll pay for a gas lunch

1029
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,820
Hey, hey, so if you you don't think you're capable of getting that look to the sky at it done

1030
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,260
You don't think you're ever gonna combo that

1031
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,060
You know

1032
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,520
The another edits gonna have a nice

1033
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,900
Yes, the another edit if you don't think you're gonna be able to full combo the another edit anytime soon

1034
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,160
Come get Jamie and take her to Concord cuz she needs it. She's arrived

1035
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,100
The big tournament in Concord will give a shout-out to this because Stark sounds our buddy and

1036
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:52,040
He's doing a little tourney putting together one on Saturday in Concord

1037
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,720
dollar Mendy's summer vacation, I believe it's called and

1038
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,740
It's sure to be exciting. It's going to be the very first

1039
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:04,020
one broadcast over the internet they're going to have a little streaming thing

1040
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:11,740
going on there. If I recall the page correctly it's tunac.floop.net. I am

1041
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:16,540
not sure that's probably it that sounds like it to me. But you can also there on

1042
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:20,460
the tournament's discussion thread I'm sorry not thread before I'm on DDR

1043
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:26,300
Freak there is a link to the page and some feedback on what's going on. Cool.

1044
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:32,300
It has the best freestyle category ever, waste of two minutes of my life and I want it back.

1045
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:37,300
That would be the one I would enter, if I were to enter freestyle.

1046
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:42,300
I'm taking the bat to bang people over the head with.

1047
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:51,300
I am unable to make the tournament, I'm still looking at my options for possibly joining the tournament in the evening, but I know for one I won't be able to make it in the morning.

1048
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,300
morning.

1049
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,300
So we'll see.

1050
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,100
However, I can say that Orange Lounge Radio is going to be covering the tournament.

1051
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,220
We might be involved on another level, but I don't know yet.

1052
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,760
We're still dotting our I's and crossing our T's on that.

1053
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,760
We don't know yet.

1054
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,760
Again, Jamie needs a ride to Concord.

1055
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,480
But pay close attention to the station, pay close attention to our website the next few

1056
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,480
days.

1057
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,300
You may find some interesting news, but I don't know yet.

1058
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,300
We'll see.

1059
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,420
We have to have our people call their people and all that stuff.

1060
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,580
But we know for sure we'll at least be covering it, because Jamie is going to be going to

1061
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,620
the tournament, assuming she gets a ride.

1062
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,620
And doing some interviews.

1063
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,620
I'll get there one way or another.

1064
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:32,020
She'll be doing her woman on the street interviews.

1065
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,020
I'm sorry?

1066
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,020
We'll have Bradley do interviews.

1067
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,180
We should have Bradley do interviews.

1068
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:40,100
I think my idea for Bradley, because Bradley kind of gets the rep on the show for not talking

1069
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,300
much.

1070
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:47,100
I think I would like Bradley to do the interviews at Golf Land with the people who just look

1071
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,640
really scary and don't do anything with the money

1072
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,420
i'd love to

1073
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,360
get a microphone a probably make an interview those people i'll be fun

1074
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,080
what you think bradley

1075
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,660
no comment

1076
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,300
fair enough not have something was sick

1077
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,340
f after it

1078
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,720
i've been doing here but anyways

1079
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,620
slalom as well

1080
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,020
uh...

1081
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,560
okay

1082
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,500
i got it

1083
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,640
anyways uh... or

1084
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,680
do not

1085
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,500
jamie

1086
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:21,500
I hate to do this to myself since I've pushed it back 3 weeks now, damn Q's are a trip, I may be able to give you a ride down the concrete.

1087
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:33,500
I'll go ahead and do that, maybe push it back another week or so or just stick with this, or stick with this the 7th and we'll go then and I'll just give you a ride down there.

1088
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,500
You officially get the My Hero of the Year award?

1089
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
This one's for Matt, this one's for Matt.

1090
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,380
here you go

1091
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:49,380
okay we're going to take another really quick break because i'm

1092
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,860
selfish and i have to pee

1093
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,780
so we take a break when i have to be unless you want to go on before we let

1094
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,580
unless you want it

1095
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,840
do unless i can just get up and go and i think all right

1096
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,080
all right fine you did this

1097
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,760
the jamie show now have fun

1098
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,560
i have both of the mics in my head haha

1099
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,000
i'm really give the the microphone to the microphone

1100
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yeah, that would probably make some weird echo if you're talking in both mics at once, wouldn't it?

1101
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But, um...

1102
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Someone wants to get fucked.

1103
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Who wants to get fucked?

1104
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I don't know, who wants to get fucked?

1105
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Uh, who is he talking about?

1106
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Sukkah Kicks, dude, who are you talking, who wants to get fucked?

1107
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I don't know, come on.

1108
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
He just says yes.

1109
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You want to get fucked?

1110
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yay! He wants to get some!

1111
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Hahahaha!

1112
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
No.

1113
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,760
um you know what i think actually at this point you know perhaps uh it might be in our best

1114
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,800
interest to uh take a break go to break but in the meantime why don't you uh give your big money

1115
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,800
experience of the week my big money experience i passed a cata damn it yes i did finally it's a

1116
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,360
real one it's actual it's not like burning the floor which is like a fake cata you know

1117
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,720
this one's actually cockamay fake cata burning the floor is a seven it just jumped up to cata

1118
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,320
you know it's not a cata we know it's not a cata but damn it kakume shouldn't

1119
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,000
be a cata but it is a cata all right well we're going to break right now even

1120
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,800
though Rob is now finished peeing. Too bad it's my turn and we're going to break I think

1121
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,800
executive decision is coming to play we'll be back after these this song or so

1122
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,560

01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,560
And I just want you back

1125
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:53,320
Let's

1126
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:57,320
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1127
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,320
Do you want to be a chef inside Hollywood?

1128
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,320
No!

1129
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,320
Do we show up people's finger bush?

1130
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,320
No!

1131
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,320
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1132
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,320
Yes!

1133
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,320
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1134
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,320
I say we let him go. No!

1135
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,320
Welcome back. We're still here.

1136
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,320
Hi, I'm back.

1137
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,320
We've got PB.

1138
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,320
My bladder is empty, thank you.

1139
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
Thank you for taking over the show there.

1140
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,320
Now I know I can take a week off and leave the show in good hands.

1141
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,320
We'll just have to keep him here.

1142
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:45,320
Ooh, we've got some fans in the chatroom who are sick of our old promos, who are threatening to make new ones.

1143
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,600
make new ones, go for it.

1144
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,440
We'd love to hear some fan-made promos.

1145
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,600
I think that would be funny.

1146
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,220
I just question, you know, if you're a fan of the show,

1147
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,920
let's get your voice on the station somehow.

1148
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,040
It's everybody's show.

1149
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,700
We want everybody to be a part of this show.

1150
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,840
We don't have the call-in capabilities yet.

1151
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,680
That's something we're-

1152
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
There's a party on our show and everyone's coming.

1153
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,680
That's something we're looking for for the future

1154
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,120
is hopefully we can get some phone calls into the show.

1155
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:11,100
But unfortunately that takes a kind of complex process

1156
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,560
to get happening, which includes giving out

1157
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,920
my phone number over the air, which I'm not quite ready for.

1158
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,500
and uh... eight hundred numbers somewhat of an investment so if we did have phone

1159
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,880
set up only people who already know me and my number would be able to call

1160
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,340
so uh...

1161
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,380
i don't know how that would go

1162
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:29,500
but if you want to make a promo for our show just email us at orange lounge

1163
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,420
radio at yahoo dot com and we'll tell you what we need

1164
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,480
you want to say anything for the show if there's a song you want to hear in our

1165
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,840
bamani music amore program which plays

1166
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,440
all the freaking time on the station when we're not here

1167
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,640
just email us at orange lounge radio and yahoo.com

1168
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,040
Gentle stress.

1169
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,160
We have gentle stress in our playlist.

1170
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,280
Okay, uh, the original version of gentle stress.

1171
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,420
From 2DX or...

1172
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,520
Yes, that's in our playlist.

1173
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,580
Okay, then the AMV sexual mix of gentle stress.

1174
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,600
Give the mic back to Jamie now, please.

1175
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,120
Wrong!

1176
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,220
You win absolutely nothing!

1177
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,040
Uh,

1178
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,300
good suggestion from the chat room, would an AOL instant messenger talk work?

1179
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,700
I think actually it would,

1180
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,220
but not very well, so I'm

1181
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,600
not sure if I want to try that just yet. You might want to test it out with Yahoo Chat

1182
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:23,600
because you can't have multiple people. Sometimes we do tests late at night when you guys aren't

1183
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:28,120
expecting it and will go live suddenly. Pretty soon Jamie is going to be doing her own just

1184
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:33,120
spur of the moment live shows. Yep, I've been planning on playing non-stops in J-Rock.

1185
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:40,120
I was going to say that Tech TV uses some sort of program for webcasting or something

1186
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,120
or something like that, you might check in and see if you use the same program to see what they use.

1187
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,120
You know, we need to get this show on television, what do you guys think?

1188
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,120
Yeah.

1189
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,120
Let's write those people at that new...

1190
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,120
What's that new station, G4 or whatever, all about video game talk?

1191
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,120
Maybe.

1192
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,120
Do you think Konami would ever let us do this show on there, though?

1193
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:03,120
I have no idea if Konami even knows we exist.

1194
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,120
I would doubt it.

1195
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:09,120
But I would think, though, that if we did maybe something about all music games,

1196
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,680
Which we pretty much do anyway. We talk about all sorts of music games on the show.

1197
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,680
We're all-encompassing.

1198
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,680
It just happens to be Bomanias Game Radio.

1199
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,160
When was the last time you talked about Pump It Up?

1200
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,780
Well, let's talk about Pump It Up right now!

1201
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,000
They have it at the Folsom Game Room.

1202
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,080
What? Not at the Folsom Game Room, why did I say that?

1203
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,280
I'm thinking of, you know, out in the boonies. I'm thinking that...

1204
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,240
Are there any Pump It Up in Sacramento? There's Florin Mall.

1205
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,320
Really? Where the hell is Florin? In the Tilt.

1206
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,040
In the Ghetto Cave. Yay.

1207
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,680
Lauren Mall is in the gah-heh-heh-toe.

1208
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:44,200
I was just there yesterday to get my boombah.

1209
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:49,920
Now, see, Pump It Up is a cool game that doesn't get much respect from people because it sucks.

1210
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,480
And does it suck?

1211
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,080
Well, I mean, it hurts to play. You have to pound those damn keys.

1212
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,660
Not really.

1213
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:00,040
Okay, every Pump It Up machine I've played, you've had to pound all the keys.

1214
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,740
Especially with their gimpy freeze arrows and

1215
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,080
that whole

1216
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,800
five-arrow pack.

1217
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:12,080
You know, it's almost like The Simpsons and Springfield and Shelbyville, you know, everything

1218
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:18,200
that Pump It Up is is like utterly foreign and raw in every way, shape, and form.

1219
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,200
Everything you know is wrong.

1220
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,560
I don't know.

1221
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,560
I like it.

1222
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,960
I like to play it occasionally.

1223
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:24,960
It's cool.

1224
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,680
It's a nice little sideshow, but I just- It has the booty song.

1225
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,280
It does have some cool booty songs, which- It has Run To You.

1226
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,880
We do have some Pump It Up songs in our rotation.

1227
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,600
Maybe we should play that in our next play.

1228
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:41,760
we will. However, I don't know, I just can't get as obsessive with it as I do with DDR.

1229
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,560
I couldn't sit here for two hours and talk about, well of course we're having a hard

1230
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,240
time as it is sitting here for two hours talking about DDR, but Pump It Up, I don't know, it's

1231
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:53,560
just, it's not the same. It's not the same. Well what if they like got rid of like say,

1232
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:59,240
I don't know, the sumo and put in a Pump It Up machine? I would play it. It's like, to

1233
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,640
me it's like Guitar Freaks. I'm never gonna be that good at it and I'm not gonna play

1234
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,240
it a whole hell of a lot, but it's fun to do once in a while.

1235
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,120
Just don't leave it next to the Para Para machine.

1236
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,680
Oh, that would suck.

1237
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:13,040
But now, having a pump it up machine would be a good idea at RBGL, mainly because it's

1238
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,040
good to have change.

1239
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,520
That's why I sat down and learned to play drum mania, that's why I learned to play keyboard

1240
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,560
mania, because it sucks to sit there and freaking wait ten years for your turn at DDR Max, because

1241
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,920
no one in their right mind is going to play USA, I mean, let's be real here.

1242
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,400
But playing pump it up is at least, that's why I like San Jose Golf Light, I can go play

1243
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:38,400
I can go play Max, play Soulcalibur 2, and go back and forth between the three, right?

1244
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,400
Well, you know what my secret hope was for the longest time?

1245
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Is that they would take the neat cabinet with the widescreen monitor like Pump It Up has,

1246
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,400
and do a DDR with that kind of setup.

1247
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:59,400
Or like the HD monitors like 2DX has, and have something look good.

1248
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,840
Although it'd burn out and no one would ever want to replace it.

1249
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,880
One other game they were bringing up in the chat room a lot here is Techno Motion, which

1250
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,600
I don't know much about, but apparently there is one up the road a little ways in Nevada.

1251
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,760
I believe it's an eight or nine panel DDR.

1252
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,120
Nine panel DDR?

1253
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,280
That's got to be interesting, but I hear the song selection really, really, really, really

1254
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,280
sucks.

1255
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,680
At least Pump has some cool songs in it, but yes, ma'am.

1256
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,080
Vape of Enviroz.

1257
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:29,080
I think actually they have a website you can check out.

1258
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:45,080
In the game, I believe you can switch between 4, 5, or 8-panel. Unfortunately, there's no 9-panel, but you can play that, and I think they've got some A-list stuff, like, well, one-hit-wonder stuff, like, you know, Mambo No. 5 and, I think, Levita Loco and that kind of crap.

1259
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:51,080
Okay, just to intervene, though, Mambo No. 5 on Mambo O Go Go fuckin' rules.

1260
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:57,080
By the way, Rob, I was reading my EGM yesterday, and I saw something that I know you're going to love this, dude.

1261
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:02,080
You remember that tambourine game you played at AI, Shikoto Tambourine? It's coming to home version.

1262
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:09,080
That tambourine thing is, by far and wide, the gayest game I have ever played in my life, is that tambourine game.

1263
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:13,080
Which is why I immediately thought of you when I saw it.

1264
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,080
Stevie Nicks impersonation. That is all I could do when I'm playing that game, when I'm just like, you know, like,

1265
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:22,080
And that doesn't date Rob.

1266
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,080
I'm not that old, dammit.

1267
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:29,160
I'm old compared to you, well, not you, but you as in the chatroom people.

1268
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:33,840
But Jamie and I are the elders of the Zagbomani group, I know.

1269
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
Bite your tongue.

1270
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,240
Oh yeah, that's right, Bradley's...

1271
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,240
We're like the...

1272
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,240
He's grandpa!

1273
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,760
We're like the dead parents or something, I don't know.

1274
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,760
Isn't that what you had in Cub Scouts, was the dead mother and the dead mother?

1275
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,760
We would have gotten away for it too if it wasn't for those pesky kids!

1276
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,760
I don't know if I want to compare this group to Cub Scouts, but anyway.

1277
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,760
We're not like the Cub Scouts, we're more like the Ratatouille Scouts.

1278
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,760
But seriously, Chocoto Tambourine has got to be Robin Wright.

1279
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,760
It is freaking fruity as hell. You have to pose for that goddamn thing.

1280
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,760
Yeah, same for Samba de Amigo.

1281
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,760
But Samba's kind of cool.

1282
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,760
You have to do the crotch pose when they're both down.

1283
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,760
You can do some manly poses with sambas, you know, like, if you could be...

1284
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,760
There's no way to look manly when you're playing samba to go...

1285
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,760
Well, how about those mariachi guys? They've got little maracas, and they look...

1286
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,760
They're manly, they're studly, but...

1287
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,760
They're eunuchs.

1288
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,760
The tambourine, I'm sorry, it's gay. It's really, really gay.

1289
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,760
I mean, the maracas, at least, you can kind of swing around in it and be aggressive.

1290
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,760
You cannot be aggressive with a goddamn tambourine.

1291
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,760
You're sitting there going, oh yeah, shake it, baby.

1292
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,760
My favorite part is when it shows you, like, the little pattern,

1293
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,760
and you have to shake it in a U-pattern, like around.

1294
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,760
It's like, ooh, we're going around the world with a tambourine.

1295
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,760
They're making it for the home, though, don't you think?

1296
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,760
No, it actually, I believe it comes out this month for PlayStation 2.

1297
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,760
There's already a tambourine game called Tam Tam Paradise.

1298
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,760
Yeah, but this is the actual one, though, that AI, it's Shakoto.

1299
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,760
It's coming, and I believe it comes with a tambourine thing,

1300
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,760
and you actually do have to shake it in that weird fuck-up pattern,

1301
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,760
and it's a really retarded-looking game, honest to God.

1302
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,320
It's funny, you know what though, it does have a little bit of connection to Bamani

1303
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:18,120
because one of my favorite Bamani songs, My Sweet Darlin' for Max is in that Tambourine

1304
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,120
game.

1305
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,200
I know because that was the only song I played because I failed it!

1306
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,200
Yay!

1307
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,280
You want to know what game pisses me off though?

1308
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,120
Actually you know, I don't ever recall hearing a Tambourine playing in the background of

1309
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,120
my studio.

1310
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,880
You're done.

1311
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,680
As you know what game really pisses me off is Kraken DJ.

1312
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,680
Oh?

1313
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,240
one chance I actually sat down to play crack well I more like stood up to play

1314
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:47,120
crackin DJ with last November at AI and I absolutely failed it but I saw this

1315
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:53,480
guy at anime Expo I go in I'm still in costume like in these sports platforms

1316
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:58,160
for my Mad Hatter costume and there was this guy doing like all this expert

1317
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,320
stuff on on the crackin DJ and my god I was more impressed with that than I am

1318
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:09,320
at most 2DX players, because that just takes speed there, just to scratch like that and

1319
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:14,360
hit the little trigger in the center, that was freaking awesome.

1320
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,440
Crackin' DJ is a very cool game, I've played it and I enjoy it a lot.

1321
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:22,080
There's not very many stages, I was kind of hoping they do a Crackin' DJ part 2, but...

1322
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,080
There's one.

1323
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,080
Is there?

1324
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,560
That was the one that was at AX, if I recall correctly.

1325
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,720
My bad, I stand corrected.

1326
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:35,480
Another Bamani, not Bamani games, but they're like Bamani, that they're talking about in

1327
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,480
the chat room.

1328
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,040
The grandpa, possibly, of Bamani games, Parappa the Rappa.

1329
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,560
Kick punch, it's all in the rhyme.

1330
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,560
Awesome.

1331
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,560
That was really the first music game I ever played.

1332
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,560
My guitar is in my mind!

1333
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,440
Okay, Parappa was the most brilliant game ever.

1334
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:56,160
On Jammer Lammy, the game was freaking awesome, but for god's sake, she had the worst damn

1335
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,560
lines.

1336
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,680
I'm sorry, the baby stage ruled, and actually the baby stage used to be in...

1337
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,340
I'm so excited I threw my pen.

1338
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:10,180
The baby stage used to be in Rotation Orange Lounge, I think we took it out recently though.

1339
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:13,800
We try not to let that stuff go to death, but we do have a Parappa stage in Rotation.

1340
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,960
We're going to have some Parappa 2 music coming very soon.

1341
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,060
Now the cool part of Aja Amorlami was when you got to play through the stages with Parappa,

1342
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,580
and you got to sit and listen to the remixes of the various songs, but I don't think Parappa

1343
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:53,060
I

1344
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,060
left for a little while there.

1345
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,060
That was plenty of time for you, don't you think?

1346
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,060
Anyway.

1347
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060
Another one of my personal favorite music games.

1348
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,060
Vibriven.

1349
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,060
Naruhodou!

1350
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,060
I love Vibriven. It's so cool.

1351
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,060
I don't know what else to say.

1352
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,060
Vibriven is just the bomb.

1353
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,060
We're going to play that during the next break.

1354
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,060
We'll play a song from Vibriven for you.

1355
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,060
You want to play it a little bit right now?

1356
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,060
We'll let you get turned up a little.

1357
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,060
Yes, I have Vibriven.

1358
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
Okay, now continue.

1359
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,060
Oh, I don't know, I was done. Vibrobin's just cool, that's all.

1360
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,060
I'm sorry, the little rabbit is on crack.

1361
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,060
If you want to have fun, you play Vibrobin to a non-stop.

1362
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,060
That's insane.

1363
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:36,060
I sat down and I turned a non-stop into one track, right?

1364
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:40,060
I burned it onto a CD, and I played Vibrobin to, I think, the max non-stop.

1365
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:43,060
It's the hardest goddamn thing I think I've ever done.

1366
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:47,060
The announcer just screws up the game every time he talks.

1367
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:50,060
Because a spike comes up, or one of those weird loops comes up.

1368
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:54,700
loops comes up, and I'm sure you've played VibRibbon every time a bass beat comes, a

1369
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,820
different obstacle shows up and stuff, and you have to hit buttons corresponding. Now

1370
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:01,740
the Max soundtracks have multiple layers to their song, so multiple layers show up on

1371
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:07,660
a VibRibbon game, and so you've got like, playing Max 300 is just ass. It's absolutely

1372
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:12,140
horrible. Since your hosts seem to be busy, I'm just going to keep talking here for a

1373
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,140
second.

1374
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,140
No, bad idea.

1375
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:20,020
Well, you know, one thing that surprised me on VibRibbon when we put in, this was before

1376
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:27,740
Max 2, we put in Max 300, and we thought it was going to be evil, but so deep was worse.

1377
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,220
So deep was evil on Viv ribbon.

1378
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:38,820
You know, there's a bunch of other music games, there's Samba de Amigo, what other game can

1379
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:45,080
you play the Burning Rangers theme song to, or the Oppa Oppa song from Fantasy Zone?

1380
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,080
That was awesome.

1381
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:52,080
I know that Samba de Amigo is sitting in the next room over, but I have yet to ever even see that game.

1382
01:35:52,080 --> 01:36:01,080
We will do a Samba Fest after the show, but I do have to throw everyone out pretty soon after the show because I have to drive over to the bay tonight.

1383
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:10,080
And then there's of course the greatest game ever, Rez, which is just amazing techno music with a really gimpy shooter attached to it.

1384
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,080
And, I don't know, Frequency, I heard that was a music game. I've never actually played that one.

1385
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:19,080
Frequency is very cool. I've played Frequency. It's cool.

1386
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:27,080
I didn't really get it because nobody really taught it to me, but the parts, I was able to get through it like a stage. It's pretty cool. I like it.

1387
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:30,080
Space Channel 5 Part 2 is a very nice sequel.

1388
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:34,080
Space Channel 5 is awesome. I love Space Channel 5.

1389
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:39,400
2 just takes everything that the first game went there with and then shoots past it by

1390
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:48,760
a few miles. Pudding! I love pudding. Pudding is the best thing. You know, not many people

1391
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:54,760
like Puyo Da. I love Puyo Da. It was basically the Puyo Puyo dancing game. Which we talked

1392
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:58,560
about earlier in the show, yes? People don't like the music in it, but I absolutely love

1393
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,560
Some of it's very cool, I remember, yeah.

1394
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,560
It's cheesy fun.

1395
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,560
Hmm.

1396
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,560
Any other Bomani, or any other not Bomani games we can think of?

1397
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,560
Yes.

1398
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,560
There's a pretty fun one on Saturn that's called, that's a basically a proper clone

1399
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,560
called Jung Rhythm.

1400
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,560
I saw it, there was a post on it on DDR Free, I wanted to respond to it but never got to.

1401
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:23,560
It's a fun, it's like proper, basically it's a proper clone, you follow along, your teacher

1402
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,560
tells you something and then you follow along.

1403
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,120
It has really good music too.

1404
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:33,200
I wish I could find an album of it because the last, the sixth stage song is really awesome.

1405
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,180
I want to find a perfect version because it's a really good song.

1406
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,680
I wonder if it's on the internet somewhere.

1407
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:42,220
That's not the game that's all audio, is it?

1408
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:46,920
There was a Saturn game that I saw in San Francisco that has absolutely no graphics.

1409
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:47,920
It's all audio.

1410
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,600
It's like the real sound game, something like that.

1411
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,880
I think that's it.

1412
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,880
And you get seeds with it.

1413
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,280
Now how about the criss-cross make your own video?

1414
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,840
I know a place where you can get that in town.

1415
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:06,920
No, I was looking at SeanBaby today because I was quite possibly bored out of my mind,

1416
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:11,160
and he was describing the criss-cross make your own video thing, and it seems like the

1417
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,640
most retarded game ever known to man.

1418
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,480
I mean, honest to god, that thing looks awful.

1419
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:21,720
I got to play for a little, little bit once the C&C Music Factory make your own music

1420
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,720
video game.

1421
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,720
Oh god.

1422
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:29,080
I would love to be able to play that again. Just just like, you know, ten years later. It'll be awesome to play that

1423
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,320
God dude, I can't even remember them. They're so

1424
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:38,320
That's only 1994. Can you forget CNC music?

1425
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,880
I actually did rent the sheist girls game

1426
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,360
Shiza

1427
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,360
The Spice Girls game.

1428
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,360
Oh, oh, yes. Sorry, yes.

1429
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,360
I have that- Dude, I have Spice World in the other room.

1430
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,360
Don't get me started.

1431
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,360
Anyway, the game though-

1432
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,360
Shut up!

1433
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:01,360
The game was very, very much ass.

1434
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,360
Um, you know, I never played the MTV music generator games,

1435
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,360
although I heard that they were pretty neat.

1436
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,360
Yeah, they were. I got the computer one.

1437
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,360
Now, if we want to talk about ass, we'll talk about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Magical Mall.

1438
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,360
Anyway, that's not a music game.

1439
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:20,360
But the king of the top of those, though, will always be the Bust a Move series.

1440
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,360
And I'm not naming Puzzle Bobble. I mean Bust a Move.

1441
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:28,360
That's one of Jamie's pet peeves. You're not allowed to refer to it as Bust a Groove.

1442
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,360
Funny, I like Bust a Groove quite a bit.

1443
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,360
You die. You die.

1444
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,360
It's actually better than Japanese ones, in my opinion.

1445
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,360
Ow.

1446
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:42,360
Now, this is interesting. You play Spice World, but deny Britney?

1447
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,360
There's a difference between playing cheesy and then just looking at a slut.

1448
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:50,360
There's a difference between five sluts and one slut, okay?

1449
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:54,360
No, I'm sorry. Four sluts and no C.

1450
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:58,360
You mean they're not drag queens? I'm not so sure about Ginger, but hey.

1451
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:02,360
No, she said it herself. She didn't want to be with the group because she didn't want to look like a drag queen.

1452
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:06,360
And now she can be found. It's raining men

1453
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,360
and Max too.

1454
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,360
I guess we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

1455
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,360
So in this break I'm going to play a couple songs from games that we've been referencing.

1456
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:23,360
We'll start it off with a song from Pump It Up, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1457
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:30,360
out.

1458
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,360
Be found, be found, found, found, found

1459
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:10,360
That's right! I'm in the house! Here it comes!

1460
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,360
Extra extra, we don't know about it

1461
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,360
The best burgers in town from all around

1462
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,360
From around the world, come and get it

1463
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,360
The line goes around like a merry-go-round

1464
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,360
Cut!

1465
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,360
As a only

1466
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,360
Cut!

1467
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,360
You gotta, you gotta

1468
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,360
Heat!

1469
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,360
Round

1470
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,360
You gotta heat

1471
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,360
Very nicely

1472
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,360
And don't

1473
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,360
Uh-huh

1474
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,360
Mmm

1475
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,360
You gotta, you gotta

1476
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,360
You gotta, you gotta

1477
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,360
Oof

1478
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,360
You know

1479
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,360
Ha ha

1480
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,360
I'm good now

1481
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,360
Come on

1482
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,360
Cut!

1483
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,360
Mmm

1484
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,360
Cut!

1485
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,360
Very nice

1486
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,360
You gotta heat

1487
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,360
Heat

1488
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,360
You gotta, you gotta

1489
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,360
Don't

1490
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,360
Ha ha, yes

1491
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,360
House! Very nice!

1492
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,360
And a hook!

1493
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,360
Yes, right!

1494
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,360
Bugger, surprise, and shake over a friend

1495
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,360
If you'll efficiently line up at the end

1496
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,360
Come on, people, gather on

1497
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,360
We've got everything you want from all around

1498
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,360
Hot fella diss

1499
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,360
Hot fella diss

1500
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,360
You've got to

1501
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,360
Eat the grill!

1502
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,360
Eat the grill!

1503
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,360
Toot!

1504
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,360
Toot the buns!

1505
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,360
My buns are very close to fun

1506
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,360
Eat up and cook the bodies.

1507
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,360
Cook the bodies.

1508
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,360
Fill the drinks.

1509
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,360
Serve the drinks.

1510
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,360
And mince the cheese.

1511
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,360
Mince the cheese.

1512
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,360
Tastes the fries.

1513
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,360
French fries.

1514
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,360
Whisk the floor.

1515
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,360
Sweep the floor.

1516
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:41,360
The ketchup, the mustard, the salt and the pepper.

1517
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,760
Oh, it's all right, guys, we got no extra You watch the grill, control the thing, guys

1518
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,360
Follow the rules, be productive and nice And cook those burgers

1519
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,360
Cook those burgers

1520
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,360
Mmm, turn the patty over

1521
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,360
Turn the patty over

1522
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,360
Come on and watch them fries

1523
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,360
I'm not spitting

1524
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,360
Watch them fries

1525
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,360
Better execute the nut

1526
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,360
Better execute the nut

1527
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,360
Bring on the ketchup

1528
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,360
Bring on the ketchup

1529
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
Don't forget the cheese

1530
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:47,360
Yeah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about! Now go serve those burgers right now!

1531
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,360
Alright! I'm off to a good start!

1532
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:36,720
Yo! The beats are strong Yo! The beats are strong, but the night is long

1533
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,100
Stop now, stop now

1534
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:13,440
Stop, stop, stop cause he needs to be

1535
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,760
Stop I need

1536
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:22,860
Stop now, stop now

1537
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:27,580
Stop, stop, stop cause he needs to be

1538
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:31,220
Stop, stop, stop for he needs to be

1539
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,700
Yo the beat is strong

1540
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,280
Yo the beat is strong

1541
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:09,280
Yo, the beats are strong, but the night is long

1542
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:16,280
Yo, the beats are strong, yo, the beats are strong, but the night is long

1543
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:31,280
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together

1544
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:35,660
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

1545
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:39,120
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1546
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,640
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1547
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:46,760
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1548
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,400
Yes, thank you Mel B. Who is-

1549
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,200
Give me a dollar.

1550
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,000
Mel B was here in the house a couple weeks ago.

1551
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It was a good show.

1552
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And Melody was here too.

1553
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,280
Melody was here too, and hopefully they're going to be back.

1554
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,280
We don't know when, but-

1555
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,280
Hope so.

1556
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,420
Hopefully soon.

1557
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:03,380
In that set, a lot of people in the chat room going, what was that, what was that, what

1558
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:04,380
was that?

1559
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,140
Although I was being a tease and I didn't say anything because I wanted to tell you

1560
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,140
right now.

1561
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:13,100
We heard first off from Pump It Up, we heard DJ Doc with Run To You and then we heard the

1562
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:19,100
first stage I believe in Parappa the Rappa Part 2 and that was Toasty Buns.

1563
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:20,740
And it's very hot in California today.

1564
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:25,480
You know, cook those burgers, don't forget the teas.

1565
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,820
And then what did we hear last there, Jamie?

1566
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:34,260
The very last one was from Vibribin. It's one of the original tracks that was on Vibribin.

1567
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:37,620
I'm not sure if I actually have the file labeled right now.

1568
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:42,220
It is called Laughin' Beats. So I don't know if that was the first or second stage or what,

1569
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,020
but whatever.

1570
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:45,960
It's one of the original tracks from Vibribin.

1571
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,340
Very cool. And a lot of people in the chat room going, oh, that would be a very interesting

1572
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:53,900
song in DDR. There'd be a lot of BPM changes they could take use of.

1573
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,700
Tempo changer out the ass.

1574
01:48:55,700 --> 01:49:02,700
Vicky sat here and did a Viv ribbon song on his sim, and it's got some absolutely ridiculous freaking tempo changes in there.

1575
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:18,700
I'd like to correct Tal there. I did not do that song. I believe, I can't even remember who did it, it was back, it was a BMS file somewhere, and the same people did another Viv ribbon song. I believe it was, I don't even remember what it's called now, Love in Peace or something like that.

1576
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:23,700
Anyways, and the same people did this other song.

1577
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:24,940
I can't remember what it was.

1578
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:26,220
It was really awesome, though.

1579
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,940
I think they also did, what was it,

1580
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:30,380
Ooh Ah, Just a Little Bit, whatever that song is.

1581
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:34,460
Yeah, so it wasn't me.

1582
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:36,940
I don't really make that many songs.

1583
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:39,220
But yeah, still, though, this thing sped up,

1584
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:41,700
slowed down, and it does that in the game, too.

1585
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,560
It really, really fucks with you.

1586
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,840
I mean, the game will speed up and slow down.

1587
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,340
I mean, it'll go with the song,

1588
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:52,620
But it'll still, you're not expecting it, and you guys need to play this game, it's so good.

1589
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,340
I can't wait until Mojave Ribbon comes out.

1590
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:59,540
It's actually been re-released, like, for, the first one, though, has been re-released, I think, through PlayStation The Best, hasn't it?

1591
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,340
Yes. To my knowledge, yes.

1592
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:04,340
Although, I have a nicer original copy.

1593
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,340
Yeah, I have an original copy, too.

1594
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:09,340
Because piracy is bad.

1595
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:13,340
Well, the original, though, is in the best case.

1596
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,340
That, too.

1597
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,340
It's backwards.

1598
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:19,940
but it's not that piracy was bad so much as if we couldn't figure out for the life of how to copy the damn game

1599
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:23,700
and so it only cost I believe 15 bucks off of NCSX

1600
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:28,340
so I went and bought it like that night. Actually all you gotta do is you load it up and you're all

1601
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:28,700
anyway

1602
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:32,900
You got it for 15 from NCSX?

1603
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:36,460
It must have dropped the price. When I bought mine, I bought mine for 40.

1604
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:43,340
Wow. Yeah. I think it's 30 right now. It wasn't 15, I got it for 30 bucks, I'm sorry. Liar.

1605
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,460
I paid $40 for mine.

1606
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,880
A couple other topics before we close out the show

1607
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,060
really fast, uh...

1608
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,340
Another road trip to Lodi.

1609
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:54,620
Road trip to Lodi. We're thinking about taking the show on the road at some point.

1610
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:58,520
We're thinking we might do the Walmart and Lodi as a solo 2K machine.

1611
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,920
How would you like to hear Orange Lounge from Walmart, huh?

1612
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,680
That sounds like fun, but I'll be too busy using my mutant power on the crane machine.

1613
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:10,300
Oh, God. Don't get Jamie near a crane machine. How many animals did I walk out of there with, what,

1614
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,460
nine?

1615
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:14,780
That was a really scary day, dude.

1616
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:17,620
She tucked the damn machine and six more stuffed animals come out of it.

1617
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:21,460
And we all got our cute little Pokemon keychain thingy that's got mine.

1618
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:25,260
And like, but that solo machine in the ghettoest goddamn location in the world.

1619
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,980
All these weird scary white people are looking at me all funny.

1620
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:33,340
And we're sitting here trying to play our booty songs and do our mad three foot skills with the,

1621
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,540
what was it, the two diagonals on the bottom one.

1622
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:36,980
Trying to play their eight footers.

1623
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:39,740
It's like, oh look, there's an upper left over there, yay!

1624
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:43,740
I took a nap in the Daytona machine.

1625
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:47,740
So yeah, we might take this road on the show in the future. Something they were talking about in the chat room earlier,

1626
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:51,740
I'm not sure if we've touched on this subject in an earlier show. I seem to recall

1627
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:55,740
we might have discussed it, but favorite drink when playing Bahmani games? Have we talked about this?

1628
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:59,740
Pocari Sweat. Oh yeah, we did do this a couple weeks ago. Although there are

1629
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:03,740
some new drinks out. This Pepsi Blue, what do you think of that? Has anybody had Pepsi Blue?

1630
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:07,740
I have something like five or six bottles of Pepsi Blue in my fridge.

1631
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:12,460
stuff is really really good but you can't really drink it like you can't

1632
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:15,900
pound down a six-pack of it because you'll like die of diabetes or something

1633
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:20,820
it looks like Windex but and it kind of tastes like no it tastes like strawberry

1634
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:23,820
soda and cotton candy I think is the only way I can describe Pepsi Blue it's

1635
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:27,240
kind of a hybrid of the two of those. I thought the fun of cotton candy was having it be

1636
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:31,620
dissolving and fluffy. Well the thing is I like blueberry flavored sodas I mean I've

1637
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,980
always been big on the blueberry chip the blueberry soda strawberry soda

1638
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,980
But I was hoping they would bring back something like Crystal Pepsi. Pepsi blew the bit too saccharine.

1639
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:41,980
Crystal Pepsi was the shit.

1640
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:42,980
I agree.

1641
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:47,980
I remember marching in Mardi Gras in Mobile.

1642
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:51,980
Okay, everybody, I'm from the town that Mardi Gras originated in.

1643
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,980
How many beads did you win that night?

1644
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:54,980
Oh, God.

1645
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:59,980
Since we can just give them to us after the parade, but I digress.

1646
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:04,900
they had they had pulled out cases of crystal pepsi is that they don't make

1647
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:09,820
this anymore they gave it to us for free drink it up

1648
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:13,400
yeah i sure was crystal pepsi or was it crystal pepsi and vodka?

1649
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,220
they never know it

1650
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,980
no it was crystal meth

1651
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,380
that's how they got us to go

1652
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:21,140
uh... here's an interesting description of pepsi blue i like this one

1653
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:24,880
looks like windex tastes like you're sucking on chlorox wipes

1654
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,300
now i take issue with that comment i mean

1655
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,860
Oh my god, Jamie's hawking off over here.

1656
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,620
But no, I take issue with that comment.

1657
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:34,260
I mean, it's a good soda.

1658
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:35,900
It's just too sweet.

1659
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,620
Drink one a day or something maybe at most.

1660
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:39,660
But I like to do it.

1661
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:41,260
I mix it with my Indian green soda

1662
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:43,220
so it looks like this cool blue-green stuff,

1663
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,300
and it tastes really sweet.

1664
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,180
But the ultra-saccharine nature of Pepsi Blue

1665
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,860
is a bit cut down a bit, and it tastes a whole lot better.

1666
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:51,700
What about the people who are addicted to Ghetto Kool-Aid?

1667
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,900
Do you think they'll have a problem with it?

1668
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,060
No.

1669
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:57,140
Because it does kind of taste like Ghetto Kool-Aid.

1670
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:01,860
Pepsi Blues kind of carbonated ghetto Kool-Aid. Although I will say though, out of all the

1671
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:04,420
new drinks out on the market, the winner is Vanilla Coke.

1672
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:06,900
Vanilla Coke. I utterly disagree, but that's because I've

1673
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:11,420
just never liked Vanilla Coke. You're just an ass, so I'm just kidding.

1674
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,500
We love Todd. I can't believe that SoCalCake hasn't heard

1675
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:18,640
of Pepsi Crystal. Where the hell have you been for the past ten years, bro?

1676
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:22,140
Crystal Pepsi was on edge. Crystal? When was Crystal Pepsi's out?

1677
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:25,900
That's it. I'm probably not going to use it, but I'm

1678
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,900
I'm making a banner with a crystal Pepsi can on it.

1679
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:36,620
Crystal Pepsi era of growth was from something like 1993 up until about 1995 before it died.

1680
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,020
We have a follow-up comment.

1681
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:40,100
Hey, are you dissing Clorox wipes?

1682
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:42,380
Have you even tried sucking on them?

1683
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,920
Creamy Clorox goodness.

1684
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,420
I've never heard Clorox described as creamy.

1685
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:49,500
It gets your guts clean.

1686
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,140
Your poo will smell lemon fresh.

1687
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:54,140
No, we are not having any mint scattles reference.

1688
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:58,140
But now we have, like, lemon scattles.

1689
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:00,140
Feel the mint. Taste does rainbow.

1690
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:03,140
Now, Coke, too, on the other hand, was the biggest pile of ass ever.

1691
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:04,140
They still sell that in Britain.

1692
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:07,140
New Coke is huge in Britain.

1693
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:11,140
But then again, in Britain, you can also go into Burger King and buy a bean burger, okay?

1694
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:13,140
So, they have no fucking taste.

1695
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:15,140
Wasn't that just a tofu burger?

1696
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:20,140
No, this is a burger. It's got, like, you take fucking Taco Bell beans or something,

1697
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:23,140
and you lump it in between two buns with cheese and lettuce and all that shit.

1698
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,140
It's called a bean burger. It's a vegetarian thing.

1699
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:29,140
Now, being the token vegetarian, I went and had one at the airport.

1700
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:33,140
And, oh my god, I was crying for a goddamn tofu burger.

1701
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:35,140
And I hate tofu.

1702
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:37,140
They're so crazy.

1703
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:39,140
What will they think of that?

1704
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:44,140
One other quick, quick topic we want to talk about.

1705
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:45,140
How are they going to...

1706
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:49,140
Now, this is a rumor that we've got the PS2 broadband thing coming soon, the adapter.

1707
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:52,140
It's going to let us all get online with our PS2s.

1708
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:56,140
making some kind of music game, but they haven't said much more. We know Frequencies!

1709
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:58,140
That's Marshall Beat!

1710
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:02,140
We know that Frequencies is online, but we also know that VIBRIBIN-SQL-EMOJIBRIBIN is online,

1711
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:07,140
which is really cool in that you take text files, run it through, and the little rabbit turns it into a

1712
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:14,140
custom-made wrap. It's like we used to do with our old voice reader things back in the old days of Windows 3.1 and shit,

1713
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:18,140
where you'd have the weird, funky voice reader little text message.

1714
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:21,500
I am that computer oh you mean I'm going to say

1715
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:25,420
book book you exactly

1716
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:28,620
the things were horrible you look like shite

1717
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:33,820
and there was there was there was there was the DOS program that was

1718
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:37,980
I'm this is my favorite one I was I think in eighth grade

1719
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:42,780
you the psychologist doctor said

1720
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:46,660
you say I hate you and wish that you would die he'd be like why do you feel

1721
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:47,300
that way

1722
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:54,940
That program was the most retarded program, it was so much fun to fuck with, I think it's

1723
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:58,820
only a DOS based program though.

1724
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:03,960
It was a Soundbuster or Soundbuster Pro program, I still think I have the discs for that.

1725
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,300
That would be winner.

1726
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:10,200
Ah, our lovely researcher Chabberwocky found that Crystal Pepsi was born in test markets

1727
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:17,440
on April 13, 1992, and it went national in 1993, with a campaign featuring Van Halen's

1728
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,440
right now.

1729
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:19,440
I remember that one.

1730
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,440
Yes, I do.

1731
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,120
Because I remember the parody commercial they did on Saturday Night Live for Crystal Gravy.

1732
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,880
I don't know if any of you ever saw that.

1733
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,880
I do have a memory of that.

1734
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,640
Crystal Gravy was so funny.

1735
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,520
Anyway, I guess you had to be there.

1736
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:40,060
That was back in the high period of Saturday Night Live, 1993 to 1994.

1737
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:45,300
when I was like 12 or something. Dude, I drank a gallon of Crystal Pepsi a day during school

1738
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,300
years that day.

1739
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:47,300
That explains a lot.

1740
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:50,300
I started my senior year of high school in 93. Don't make me feel bad.

1741
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:54,580
We'll talk more about online games and all that stuff next week. Maybe we'll know more.

1742
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:56,500
93? I was in freaking seventh grade.

1743
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,500
I graduated in 94.

1744
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:02,020
No, sixth or seventh grade is when I got into 93. Damn, you're old.

1745
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,900
Bite my ass.

1746
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:09,860
And on that note, I think we're going to end the show. Any final notes other than fuck

1747
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:13,860
What? Yes. Yes, but fuck you next week.

1748
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,860
Start my, where's my music? Oh, hold on.

1749
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:21,860
We've got to find your music. We've played a lot of music tonight in the middle of the show.

1750
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:25,860
I've got to find your music. Here we go, I got it.

1751
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:29,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you.

1752
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:33,860
Well put, thank you. Alright, we're ending the show now.

1753
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:37,860
Any final thoughts from the lovely Miss Doc Sekuro?

1754
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:41,100
I'm a mic whore.

1755
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:42,100
You are!

1756
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,100
Yes you are.

1757
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,100
And a towel!

1758
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:45,100
Anything you'd like to say, Matt?

1759
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,100
No?

1760
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,100
Alright.

1761
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:48,100
Bradley?

1762
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:49,100
Nope.

1763
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:50,100
Nope it is!

1764
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:57,860
On behalf of everybody here in the studio tonight, thank you guys, goodnight, whatever.

1765
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:01,900
Listen to our Bamani Music and More program because we want to whore up our ratings and

1766
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:04,900
that's the best way to do it is when we have listeners, so listen to us all the time.

1767
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:08,300
When you're sleeping, just leave it on and let the music fill your dreams.

1768
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:10,580
Oh god, I feel sorry.

1769
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:20,580
You'll be dreaming about everything from dancing pom-pokalyn to petite love and fear factories

1770
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:21,580
there.

1771
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:22,580
Alright.

1772
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:23,580
The end.

1773
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:24,580
Good night.

1774
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:25,580
Goodbye.

1775
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:26,700
And next week, we'll have our kutimu impression.

1776
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:27,700
Oh, let go of it!

1777
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:28,700
Shut up, Shima.

1778
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:29,700
Microphone whore.

1779
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:30,700
Goodbye.

1780
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:33,940
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1781
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:37,700
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1782
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:44,100
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts,

1783
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,820
also known as Sky.

1784
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:49,540
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1785
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:56,020
Well, son, a funny thing about regret is that it's better to regret something you have done

1786
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:59,060
than to regret something you haven't done.

1787
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:07,840
By the way, if you see your mom this weekend, be sure and tell her, Satan!

1788
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:11,360
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
