00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:04,599
[SPEAKER_12]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:08,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Our live talk program begins now.

00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:48,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it 4215 Pussywave?

6
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:49,398
[SPEAKER_13]: You bitch!

7
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Now let me check the zip code.

8
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,439
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-2-fuck you!

9
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,120
[SPEAKER_13]: You have no morals, darling.

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching kiss of purpose.

11
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:00,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Kiss my great news.

00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:03,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hidey ho.

13
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

14
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:07,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too!

15
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucker, yeah?

16
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:09,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on it.

17
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:10,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Loser.

18
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:11,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Lame!

19
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the size of my face.

20
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:18,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

21
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

22
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:25,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I am your singing telegram.

23
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura TV

24
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: This is episode number 8 for August the 11th of 2002, and of course, as always, we're joined by many in-studio friends tonight.

25
00:01:58,766 --> 00:01:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Irene.

26
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:00,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

27
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley.

28
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:02,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

29
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:03,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brad.

30
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:04,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

31
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:06,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's eating a donut.

32
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tal.

33
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:07,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo.

34
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the first time that Tal's ever heard the intro, also, I think.

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets old really fast.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,830
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a new one for Show 10.

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Show 10, we get a whole new thing.

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a whole new website and everything.

39
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:18,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

40
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:24,615
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be special.

41
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:28,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

42
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:33,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to work in a request I've been trying to play for like the past three weeks.

43
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that Jamie has an extra special request to give out.

44
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So this goes out to Kelly.

45
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:41,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday.

46
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is your request.

47
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday to you.

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever.

49
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:49,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

50
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:42,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you keep me like a nasty girl?

51
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,404
[SPEAKER_09]: You wanna nasty love?

52
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that you want me honey, but feeling so much pain

53
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:02,758
Thanks for watching!

54
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:51,291
All the chains combined I don't wanna find my way to you I'd be reaching for my head Speaking the secrets of my heart To chase the sun

55
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:17,459
Thank you for watching!

56
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:48,843
Oh, Ash!

57
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:56,173
[SPEAKER_21]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

58
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And that said, you heard a special request.

59
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Bambi with Cowgirl and Mr. T, Take Me Higher from 2DX4 style, 2DX6 style, Silhouette of My Mind.

60
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ass!

61
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:23,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie thinks quite the opposite of ass when it comes to Silhouette of My Mind.

62
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That is like my favorite song and I have two fuck you's of the week now.

63
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,647
[SPEAKER_04]: There's my music.

64
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The last file is messed up.

65
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

66
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:04,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it was funny how at least a good fifth of the people at the last Spiegel tournament were doing the booty dance.

67
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:05,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

68
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:15,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing a routine where somebody was actually dancing to that song, and I swear it was like, if it wasn't the exact booty dance, it was heavily influenced by the 2DX4 style booty dancers.

69
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:24,528
[SPEAKER_04]: and for those that don't know the 2DX4 style booty dancers, there are these two dancers that appear in probably five or six of the videos in 4Style.

70
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they show up in Conga, Take Me Higher, what else?

71
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Gary Gary Daddy.

72
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary Gary Daddy.

73
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:31,859
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't show up as star mine.

74
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:32,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, Brad.

75
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And Nasty.

76
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Nasty.

77
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, Nasty Bella.

78
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:40,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I hear Nasty, I think of the Janet Jackson song.

79
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:47,426
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not talking about the booty dancers from Third Style, because Third Style also has, like, Third Style has some real, like, Jerry Springer, ghetto booty dancers.

80
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:49,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The Fourth Style ones, though, were still booty.

81
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,368
[SPEAKER_07]: They were like Booty Max.

82
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Booty Max.

83
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Third Style may be Booty Deluxe, I don't know.

84
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember the solo mix booty dancers?

85
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:02,528
[SPEAKER_24]: No, what?

86
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:12,255
[SPEAKER_24]: They were in the background of virtually every freaking thing on solo bass, and they were like ugly ass people who were just kind of busting their groove, I guess is the proper term for this.

87
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget about... That's the reason to ban a solo machine.

88
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,294
[SPEAKER_07]: About the badly animated booty dancers from the old Beat Manias.

89
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

90
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:29,558
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even like real videos, that's just like bad crappy animation, like two frames a second animation of like... They sure are booty.

91
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

92
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're also being asked in the chat room, when am we...

93
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:38,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We are speak good!

94
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,415
[SPEAKER_04]: We are speak good!

95
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that there's another half of her floating around that's sort of pulsing and bloody and gory?

96
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

97
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, oh, let me plug the chat room real fast.

98
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:25,875
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join in our chat room festivities, all you have to do is join any other side IRC server.

99
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:34,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just go and download MIRC at MIRC.com, and then you're just going to connect to any other side IRC server like IRC.

100
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to interrupt this.

101
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

102
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,680
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the gayest hand gesture I've ever seen Rob make.

103
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

104
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's radio.

105
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,541
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't see that.

106
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't see it.

107
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:41,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's radio.

108
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:42,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I could help it.

109
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:43,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I started eating.

110
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

111
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did it again!

112
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:05,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you can join our chatroom at irc.eggheads.org Make it stop!

113
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

114
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:08,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this what kind of show we're going to have tonight?

115
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:09,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly.

116
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:11,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we had pita stokes last week.

117
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, 310 Emmy and Pantsless Rage.

118
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:15,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Matt's here.

119
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's tardy for once.

120
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of punishment do we have for Matt?

121
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:23,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the duct tape.

122
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

123
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

124
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:25,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosted shit.

125
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make him drink the cigarette tree out back.

126
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:35,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

127
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to get into that.

128
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:37,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

129
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:38,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to the chat room.

130
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to my fuck you of the week.

131
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:40,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

132
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:42,536
[SPEAKER_04]: They know how to join the chat room by now.

133
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:43,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Just channel Orange Lounge.

134
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:43,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

135
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into Jamie's FU of the week.

136
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two fuck yous of the week.

137
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one goes to my cat, Shermie.

138
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally double A'd.

139
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:54,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

140
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:54,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

141
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:54,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

142
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

143
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

144
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,120
[SPEAKER_04]: This song just isn't going to work.

145
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,560
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to rant about Shermie...

146
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:13,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, for the Shermie rant, you know, I'm not, I know I'm not a really great 2DX player, you know, I'm getting better, but I finally PA'd Silhouette of My Mind, not PA, why did I say PA?

147
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally double A'd Silhouette of My Mind.

148
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:24,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Shermie walks behind my PlayStation 2 and unplugs it before it saves, and I haven't been able to do it since I had like three pours, and that was driving me crazy.

149
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Now play my pissy music.

150
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:29,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

151
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:31,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Now for my real fuck you of the week.

152
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes toward germs and viruses.

153
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:37,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate them.

154
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesday, I'm happy.

155
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan takes me to RBGL and I'm playing five games of DDR in a row and feeling good and happy and proud of myself.

156
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I wake up Wednesday dead sick.

157
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:49,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have been sick.

158
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:51,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate nature!

159
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wish the world would explode!

160
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I could take over hell.

161
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:55,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

162
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:19,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that nice?

163
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:21,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean explode, I mean implode.

164
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:22,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be a big black hole.

165
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an FU of the week too, but this is a little silly.

166
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,732
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week is white t-shirts.

167
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:41,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as you can see, I was eating chocolate ice cream earlier, and I had it sitting on my lap like a little container of Ben & Jerry's, and now it looks like someone pooed a perfect circle right on my shirt.

168
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:55,218
[SPEAKER_07]: It does look like dried shit.

169
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,646
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, it looks like someone took that cigarette can you got in your back and someone smeared all that juice right there.

170
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:03,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can do it.

171
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I've...

172
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... Yeah, I do have that.

173
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:07,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a minute.

174
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting Brad's Pissed Off Music.

175
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:12,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I have Sexy Planet in here somewhere.

176
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:14,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get Sexy Planet.

177
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:18,396
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to settle for something... What is this?

178
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:20,696
[SPEAKER_02]: This works.

179
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:21,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

180
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:26,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, see, I'm kind of getting... I think the Fuck You of the Week is getting a little old, so I'm going to do a Fuck Me of the Week.

181
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:29,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene, would you fuck me?

182
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!

183
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:31,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

184
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Not right now.

185
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The bathroom is down the hall.

186
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:42,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, use the closet.

187
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one thing to say about that.

188
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:50,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

189
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:50,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

190
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I feel like doing.

191
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes me a little bit of time to load the sounds.

192
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not super fast.

193
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Five minutes ago, she called me.

194
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:58,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

195
00:15:58,772 --> 00:15:58,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

196
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:00,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they're already done.

197
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room wants to get in on the fun.

198
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another FU of the week.

199
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:12,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this one comes from DSCS SoCalKicks, he's been a longtime supporter of the show, so I think he deserves a FU of the week.

200
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:13,257
[SPEAKER_04]: What song will we give him?

201
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:13,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give him this.

202
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:17,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give him the Dancing Pumpkins song.

203
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:26,900
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks gives FU because he could not connect to Orange Lounge Radio tonight for quite some time because of his cable internet provider.

204
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So, big FU to Cox Cable Internet.

205
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, DJ Suck Cox.

206
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:37,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Cox Sucks Cox.

207
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if Brad goes through on his offer, you'll be getting Cox Cable pretty soon.

208
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,890
[SPEAKER_07]: One more whole show of internet access.

209
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when this show resorts to potty humor.

210
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't mentioned that.

211
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,395
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, my turn, my turn, my turn.

212
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, you want Fairytale.

213
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, this is for Matt?

214
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Matt gets very tall.

215
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had Rainy Men last week.

216
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:05,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

217
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:07,085
[SPEAKER_04]: You got Rainy Men last time.

218
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's very subtle.

219
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,509
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a subtle backdrop to your FU.

220
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:22,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my minor FU of the week goes to last week's show and the very abruptly cutting off of my rant at the very end of the show for added humor purposes.

221
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:25,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't quite like that too much.

222
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:26,556
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

223
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha.

224
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:29,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

225
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:29,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

226
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:30,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

227
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:30,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

228
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:31,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha.

229
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha.

230
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,710
[SPEAKER_24]: How about we say fuck you to the heat?

231
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,331
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a hundred freaking goddamn degrees every goddamn day this week.

232
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you see, Tal, this is an international show now.

233
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,413
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people in all different countries and all places in the United States listening to this show.

234
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some places in the world, believe it or not, it is cold.

235
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:11,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them, too.

236
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:16,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, isn't it still typhoon season in Japan?

237
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:17,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

238
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:20,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember my ex... Do I look like the weather girl?

239
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:25,358
[SPEAKER_07]: My ex-t roommate Candice was in Tokyo and she was telling me about how people, like, go to work during typhoon.

240
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:31,636
[SPEAKER_24]: Well... My girlfriend's in Japan and she says it's just really hot.

241
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

242
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your girlfriend's just really hot.

243
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:39,722
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you're gay, so it doesn't matter.

244
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the cat's out of the bag, Rob.

245
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:48,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know me.

246
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know a thing about me.

247
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:54,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you gay?

248
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:56,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gay?

249
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:57,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gay?

250
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:57,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gay?

251
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:58,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you gay?

252
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Huggism Huggism Ace

253
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,716
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our last 3rd Koreans in town finally got upgraded to a Max 2.

254
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,397
[SPEAKER_07]: They should just give it to me.

255
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you think of this?

256
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:57,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like everybody who had a 3rd Korean now has a Max 2 or a 5th.

257
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody's upgrading to 3rd Koreans, but do you think that's a bad thing?

258
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:07,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, Max 2 kits are really easy to find for certain reasons that we don't want to accuse people of.

259
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:08,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Bootlegs?

260
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say it.

261
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:32,480
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you go I don't know, I'm not really missing third tree And I went and tried to play one the other day And now, forgive me, I started I really got playing on fifth makes I got good on sixth and better on seventh I went back to try to play third I couldn't see the goddamn arrows for one That's your problem

262
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:51,709
[SPEAKER_24]: They do grade harder on 3rd Koreans And 3rd Koreans are hella hard I mean, obviously you've tried to play SSR You probably grew up on that machine and stuff But I really don't miss it at all Sky was trained on a DDR USA machine You know what?

263
00:20:52,049 --> 00:21:03,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I can totally one-up it Yeah, I know, I know, girl I started on a 3rd mix and played a lot on a 1.5 Yeah, I used to play in the bathtub

264
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,179
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, this is about DDR.

265
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:12,945
[SPEAKER_02]: For, uh, Tyler here, uh, why don't you call the whambulance?

266
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God I'm going to fire you from this show.

267
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

268
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:20,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hire him.

269
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:20,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire me.

270
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:21,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even getting paid.

271
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody needs to tell Milton that we fired him a year ago.

272
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:29,469
[SPEAKER_07]: You are getting paid, you're just not getting the money.

273
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:31,930
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting paid in donuts.

274
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:33,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, you bought the donuts.

275
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:37,834
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they take his stapler, he'll set the building on fire.

276
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Set the building on fire.

277
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, yes, you have a comment?

278
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:44,878
[SPEAKER_04]: He's getting into my head.

279
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:45,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody brought donuts?

280
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt runs out of the room.

281
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:52,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, anyways, 3rd VK, it's not really that good of a machine.

282
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,898
[SPEAKER_24]: It's old, it's nostalgic, it's got gentle strats, strictly business.

283
00:21:55,338 --> 00:22:03,882
[SPEAKER_24]: But, I mean, really, think about it, the Max 2 has just got so many more songs, so many... It's new, you know, like the guy keeps saying in 4th Mix over and over.

284
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:05,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It's new!

285
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:09,524
[SPEAKER_07]: 3rd Korean, excuse me, it is the shit.

286
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the poopy!

287
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:14,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to bring on our filters.

288
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:15,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you just got hit by the filter.

289
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the poopy.

290
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Third Korean is the... Poopy!

291
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:21,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking poopy.

292
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:24,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the freak poopy.

293
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:28,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the third Koreans because there's just so many cheesy third mix songs that are just so much fun.

294
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:30,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all the good erotic songs were in third mix.

295
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Do It All Night, Oh Nick, Turn Me On were all in third mix.

296
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:35,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Although you can play them all in fourth mix.

297
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:39,024
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about being able to play like... What do I like in third grade?

298
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:39,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Starion?

299
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Hogism?

300
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:45,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I even like the regular third mixes.

301
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:49,545
[SPEAKER_07]: The third mix has this nostalgic value for me because it was my first DDR machine.

302
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:54,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I had been playing on second mix since April 2000.

303
00:22:57,147 --> 00:23:12,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I had played on the first mix for PlayStation in February 2000, but I went to Anime Expo and there was this gorgeous looking third mix machine, and I freaking saw SSR the first time and thought I was about to pee my pants or something.

304
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie does win the award, by the way.

305
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,452
[SPEAKER_04]: for being the most old school.

306
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:24,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

307
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:26,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

308
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:27,135
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

309
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:33,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the only fanfare I have is like an hour long, so.

310
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,983
[SPEAKER_07]: If it counts, I saw DDR in 1999 and thought it looked stupid.

311
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I was busy playing Buster Move 2.

312
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:43,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

313
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've talked about Bomani's Path.

314
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else want to say anything about 3rd Korean, and are we going to miss it at all, or...

315
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:52,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get that, that was confusing.

316
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:30,357
[SPEAKER_06]: as you said, the third got no play and then you're saying it'll still get no play but it'll get more play than it ever did well if it got no play and it's gonna get no play now then it's never gonna get any play oh, sure, inject your logic into everything you're not getting any play you get no dub, no dub from me you know yes I'm, see the machine

317
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:33,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's going to attach their own value.

318
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone has their favorite mix.

319
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I still think to this day my favorite overall would have to be second.

320
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:39,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

321
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

322
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know why.

323
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... I know why.

324
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:44,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It has freaking battle mode.

325
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:46,778
[SPEAKER_04]: That's step battle, yes.

326
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:48,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Step battle owns...

327
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they are warning you.

328
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the locals that chat in the chatroom, Matt, are warning you no memory card slots at Folsom Game Room.

329
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

330
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:58,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh.

331
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,268
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I do have to say that I like for the mixes after 3rd is that the old 3rd mixes had the memory card slots in the back of the machines.

332
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

333
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That I remember.

334
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember ever seeing one of those.

335
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:10,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they had them in the back of the machines.

336
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember.

337
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They're asking us... Are you guys okay there?

338
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:16,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting situated?

339
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:19,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting a little too hanky-panky back there?

340
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:27,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we need to... I remember hearing that older mixes had them in the back of the machines.

341
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:31,548
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone in the chat room is asking about the battle mode that was in 4th Mix.

342
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,972
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it's not in Kona Mix, and that battle mode is different from the one that was Step Battle in 2nd Mix.

343
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,996
[SPEAKER_24]: Step Battle in 2nd Mix had blocks of arrows go up where both players go and...

344
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,391
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, shut the hell up.

345
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, they're just messing with us in the chat room.

346
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,494
[SPEAKER_04]: The step battle was this different feature in Second Mix.

347
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:58,917
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people haven't seen it, but what it was, basically, you could dance a particular pattern, and then your opponent had to dance that too, right?

348
00:25:59,177 --> 00:25:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

349
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:03,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you would have all four arrows, but they would be basically clear.

350
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,163
[SPEAKER_07]: They would come up in a particular pattern, and you would follow that pattern stepping on whatever you wanted to.

351
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you couldn't do more than two arrows at a time.

352
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:20,450
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they would come up red for the ones that you picked and blue for the ones that your opponent picked, but you still had to dance them all.

353
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:22,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

354
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:26,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can get intense, you know, you have to be really good at sight reading.

355
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:32,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So out of second mix's step battle, third mix's unison, and fourth mix's battle, what was the best?

356
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,601
[SPEAKER_24]: The one that was in Disney's rave home version.

357
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No, was that adoption?

358
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:40,025
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was A, B, and C. There was no D. C...

359
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:46,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really, like, because I played a second mix and I guess maybe I just couldn't hear it or something.

360
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was like, I didn't get it.

361
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, what the hell is going on?

362
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:52,615
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is unison mode?

363
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:53,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I never ever figured that out.

364
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:58,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, unison mode was you had one set of arrows in the middle of the screen.

365
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:02,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, you both had to dance the green ones and then, like, one person had to do the red ones.

366
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:06,143
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like the battle mode, but it was harder because there's only one set going up the middle.

367
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:06,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.

368
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:07,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, they're going to fight.

369
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:13,091
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best part about 4th Mix's battle was it goes, they're gonna fight!

370
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:20,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, if you're in an arcade where the machines turned up really loud and the announcer says that, you'll get a bunch of those kids that call DDR gay and stuff, they'll turn around and go, what?

371
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:25,928
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember playing the one on third mix, me and my girlfriend tried to do Jam Jam Reggae Maniac.

372
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:31,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, Jam Jam Reggae Maniac is hella hard to begin with, especially when it's flat and the colors are all weird.

373
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,973
[SPEAKER_24]: And we tried it, and we had no idea how to play a unison mode to begin with.

374
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,314
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was like, what the fuck?

375
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,575
[SPEAKER_24]: They're red and green and blue!

376
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:39,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected.

377
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:42,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The arrows that both people have to dance to are actually yellow.

378
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:43,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Green was fourth mixes.

379
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:44,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

380
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:53,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually do think that I like the 1 and 4th mix better overall, but you know, still for purely nostalgic value, the second mix, Battle Mode, was really fun.

381
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:54,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that battle.

382
00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:57,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you'd like this suggestion we're getting in the chatroom, Jamie.

383
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Jabberwocky wants to make a DDR Puyo Puyo mix game.

384
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:05,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, actually, if I'm not mistaken, there is a Bomani Puyo Puyo game, correct?

385
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Bomani.

386
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:07,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, I'm sorry, yeah.

387
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:08,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Bomani.

388
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bomani-like.

389
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it's not Bomani.

390
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:22,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically plays almost exactly like Parappa, where you have your... I mean, the pattern's a little bit more complex, but you have your patterns come up, and, you know, your characters dance to it.

391
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:28,755
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know what Puyo Puyo is, it's probably best known in the States as Kirby's Avalanche.

392
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Puyo Pop for Game Boy Advance.

393
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:35,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Or didn't you have a Sonic version of it too on Sega?

394
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Robotnik's Mean Mean Machine.

395
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:39,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I do own that version too.

396
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I have all kinds of versions of Puyo Puyo, but that's besides the point.

397
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we've talked about some old school Bomani stuff.

398
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some new school.

399
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:52,381
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's a term I can use, new school.

400
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:53,682
[SPEAKER_07]: New school.

401
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:57,025
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Max USA, some slight new news on it.

402
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:02,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this was something I kind of already been assumed, but it has been confirmed by Konami of America.

403
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:08,177
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to have licensed tracks in Max USA, and not only are they licensed, they're going to be exclusive.

404
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means they're new.

405
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new!

406
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:17,204
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, there's really not much else to add until we get further announcements.

407
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Max is still, what, about three months out for USA?

408
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:23,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll probably be getting some more songs in the next few weeks.

409
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:25,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have something to say?

410
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I thought you were raising your hand.

411
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:33,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, anybody want to comment on that news or...

412
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't it coming out in November or was it October?

413
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,431
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't remember really.

414
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:43,373
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm just waiting to play something like Sonomalette 0.5 speed, you know?

415
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:48,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to replace our USA machine at RVGL, do you know?

416
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are they going to replace USA's?

417
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an arcade machine, it's a home version.

418
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:59,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, just my own little happy New Bay Money news, in five weeks I'll have my 2DX controller.

419
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:07,220
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah, there's no Konami of America arcade unit anymore, so there isn't going to be any upgrades ever.

420
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Not true, not true.

421
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:13,645
[SPEAKER_04]: They still could distribute through their third-party distributor, whoever they're going to team up with.

422
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's really, we don't know what direction that's going to take it.

423
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:19,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing, but probably going to be a good thing.

424
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't know.

425
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:22,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's too early to say.

426
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:25,054
[SPEAKER_04]: All we've got on the front now, though, is this new home version.

427
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:26,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be special.

428
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:26,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

429
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:31,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyone else want to say anything about Max USA coming up?

430
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:34,133
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, we just don't know a lot.

431
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:34,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new!

432
00:30:35,473 --> 00:30:36,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new!

433
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about all we can say to it right now.

434
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:44,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping we can get some interviews in the future on this show with people that could tell us more, but we'll see.

435
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:47,416
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if they'll even call us, or if they'll even talk to us.

436
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you?

437
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this Orange Lounge show?

438
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:58,460
[SPEAKER_02]: What I always do that works is you poison them first, and then you say if you want the antidote, then you gotta do the interview.

439
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

440
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also new, new school, Euromix 2.

441
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:08,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much, from what I'm hearing, it's Max 2 without everything good in it.

442
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:16,228
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, Oni modes and... The interface is so freaked up, it's not even funny.

443
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there is a pretty decent review of it on the DDR Freak boards in the United Kingdom Forum.

444
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Really nice review, first-hand experience.

445
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I believe links to another site called... I think it's musicgames.com.

446
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:34,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the site of it.

447
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancing Games, thank you.

448
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:39,808
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dancinggames.com, which is, I believe, a Euro-based site.

449
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:41,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

450
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:42,508
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell us.

451
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, it's Max 2 without the Onis, without any unlocks that we know of.

452
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:52,829
[SPEAKER_24]: Moreover, it's got the thing where you have to pick your difficulty after you pick the song.

453
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:54,529
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't tell you the difficulty beforehand.

454
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, no groove meter.

455
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like USA, where you have to pick the song first, and then you'll pick the difficulty.

456
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:11,537
[SPEAKER_24]: It's got some ridiculous looking... I mean, the song selection looks really cool, though, and it's got some of the Oni Mode songs already unlocked to be able to play, like Hysteria, and I forget which other ones.

457
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:12,577
[SPEAKER_24]: But, I mean, think about it.

458
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,820
[SPEAKER_24]: You can play the new songs with three levels of difficulty, and none of them are actual Oni difficulty level, I would think.

459
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:25,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being corrected on the site, that's actually dancegames.com is the name of the site.

460
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:28,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We were close enough, alright.

461
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be interesting to hear more about.

462
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,585
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all sorts of new songs in there.

463
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to dance now to Nick Carter and Steps.

464
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that amazing?

465
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:38,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, Aaron Carter.

466
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick's the one that's actually a Backstreet Boy, huh?

467
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:43,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the excitement ever start?

468
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:51,301
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I... I haven't heard much about the steps, but I guess it's nothing too special, or we would have heard more about them.

469
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we'll see them for The Sims pretty soon, so we'll have to wait for this.

470
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:57,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Good deal, good deal.

471
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:08,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you who have been dying to dance to this song, for those of you who have been dying to dance to this, Kylie Minogue, Can't Get You Out of My Head.

472
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:13,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I can't hear the song without thinking of that one video from Anime Expo.

473
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dancing Stage Party for the Euro Playstations will have Can't Get You Out of My Head by Kylie Minogue along with other songs.

474
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,856
[SPEAKER_04]: An unknown Bloodhound Gang song I know is on the list.

475
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Bloodhound Gang, oh.

476
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:29,278
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

477
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:32,359
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you've ever just been dying to dance to those songs.

478
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:38,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

479
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be coming out soon, and I haven't heard much about that.

480
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's supposedly some kind of... Oh, Matt seems to know.

481
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the nice new shiny cabinet.

482
00:33:48,714 --> 00:33:50,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're talking about the home version.

483
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:50,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the home version.

484
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I saw pictures of the new Euromix cabinet.

485
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:55,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look any different at all.

486
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:59,140
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like a darker silver chrome color.

487
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's got hardware upgrades, supposedly.

488
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,082
[SPEAKER_04]: No one really seems to know.

489
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently Euromix 2 doesn't use it.

490
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:07,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

491
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But the home version thing, I'm still saying I'm jealous because the Europeans have two exclusive mixes with licensed songs in them, whereas we had two regurgitated pieces of shit, and now we're finally getting some new shit.

492
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up with that?

493
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:39,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess the whole theory is, though, is to get the new shit, you have to play the old shit.

494
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:46,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, is that they've got to prove that the old shit's successful to invest money in the new shit, basically.

495
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's not the point.

496
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:51,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Konami didn't want to spend, because licenses in America are expensive.

497
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:55,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at how much they're charging internet radio out there to play.

498
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it's expensive, though.

499
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:04,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I point out to you also, like, when we're talking about licenses, Britney's dance beat has only five songs on it.

500
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:07,747
[SPEAKER_24]: Five songs, that's all they could afford to put on the damn game.

501
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:12,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically, it's a matter of... You would buy a Britney Spears game anyway.

502
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's by the... Well, it's a good half an hour long rental.

503
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... I still would not pay money for anything with Britney Spears in it.

504
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:29,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my money is worth more than, uh... than your tits and ass, I guess.

505
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:36,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the bottom line on why we get recycled stuff is basically, it's kind of like... I guess it's kind of having to prove yourself.

506
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:37,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately...

507
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:46,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of folks at the Konami of Japan who kind of have the rights to all the DDR stuff, they don't really believe the DDR has kind of taken off here yet.

508
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: They give up, let them move in every mix.

509
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:51,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's release this and see how it does over there.

510
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:57,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now that it's doing well, it's like, okay, we'll give more of the rights and let you license your own stuff and spend the money on that and all that stuff.

511
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:04,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, I'm being also mentioned in the chat room saying radio stations give out million dollar prizes.

512
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:05,212
[SPEAKER_04]: They have money.

513
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:06,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Not this one.

514
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,049
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

515
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:08,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I pay to do this show.

516
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,430
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give me a dollar.

517
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,172
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us money, hey, great.

518
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll set up a PayPal thing.

519
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:15,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

520
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

521
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:21,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Send us a dollar of nine and you get a vanilla cup.

522
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:23,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yats can get it.

523
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:25,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so we'll see.

524
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:29,181
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as we get more news on Max USA, we'll definitely give it over to you guys.

525
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Also new, being location tested.

526
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this last week on the show a little bit.

527
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:39,400
[SPEAKER_04]: 8th Style is brand new and is being location tested in Japan right now.

528
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the MP3s got leaked, but they were kind of bad quality.

529
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:49,886
[SPEAKER_04]: However, now we've got some very good quality 2DX 8th Style MP3s that have been leaked to the internet.

530
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:53,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've just spread around like a bad case of an aerial disease.

531
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all over now.

532
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,309
[SPEAKER_04]: But in case you haven't heard them yet...

533
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play them for you right now.

534
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:02,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all really good, in my personal opinion.

535
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:11,192
[SPEAKER_24]: They sound a lot like the stuff that came out of Beatmania 6 plus Core Remix, and a lot of the same artists are there, such as my favorite Pink Pong and Athletics and such.

536
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:17,314
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of the new songs I like a lot, but most Beatmania purists, I guess, aren't very fond of the way it is.

537
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we shall see.

538
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what the chat room thinks of these.

539
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:24,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play three songs in this break from 2DX 8th Style.

540
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:33,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hear, starting off, Tiger Yamato with V35, and then we're going to hear Mr. T with Airflow, and we'll hear Pink Pong with Star Dreams.

541
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to play those three for you.

542
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:39,105
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back to talk about 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio.

543
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:48,648
Thank you.

544
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,692
Thanks for watching!

545
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:16,444
Thank you.

546
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:16,862
Thanks for watching!

547
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:25,416
[SPEAKER_16]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

548
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:30,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

549
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Saturdays, 6.30 p.m.

550
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,461
[SPEAKER_16]: to 9.30 p.m.

551
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:37,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.

552
00:43:39,464 --> 00:43:43,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Baby, I got you, baby.

553
00:43:45,848 --> 00:43:46,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I got you, baby.

554
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:03,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.

555
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:09,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

556
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:12,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie doing a little reprise of the chicken there.

557
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he just blew out somebody's speaker there.

558
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,921
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chicken getting raped, dude.

559
00:44:22,902 --> 00:44:23,602
[SPEAKER_04]: You just heard...

560
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:29,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Three songs, brand new, just all over the internet like a wildfire this week.

561
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:30,472
[SPEAKER_11]: They're shiny.

562
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:31,913
[SPEAKER_04]: They're shiny, spankin' new.

563
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:34,055
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard first, we heard Tiger Yamato with V35.

564
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:35,095
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a spank.

565
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:39,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Second was Mr. T with Airflow, and lastly, Pink Pong with Star Dream.

566
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:46,363
[SPEAKER_04]: A little promo for that other show on Saturday nights, UnderSedationLive.org, a fun little program I've participated in.

567
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:46,803
[SPEAKER_07]: It's special.

568
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:49,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie participates in quite frequently lately.

569
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm the number one guest.

570
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:53,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night was a very neat show because for the first time,

571
00:44:54,565 --> 00:45:04,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Travis played during one of the breaks a 2DX song, which is very scary if you know Travis because he really just thinks Bomani people are dorks, but in a good way.

572
00:45:04,753 --> 00:45:08,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Never Look Back, which is a cool song, because it's goth.

573
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:11,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a cool song, I agree.

574
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:15,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a fun show, and if you like what we do here, you should definitely tune into that.

575
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:16,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super fun.

576
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:19,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to explain it, really.

577
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...

578
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:27,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, going back to 2DX8's style, what do y'all think of the music?

579
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:29,354
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Aderd's style so far?

580
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:32,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's special and shiny.

581
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:39,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but that one Tiger Yamato track freaking sounds like it's Taka.

582
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: You think maybe somebody messed up on the labeling?

583
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:45,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but it sounds like Taka.

584
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:50,218
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably all the same people.

585
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:51,655
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all Nalki!

586
00:45:51,675 --> 00:45:52,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah!

587
00:45:52,456 --> 00:46:01,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the one thing that surprised me, of course, about the list so far, and I do realize it's only a test location list, so obviously not everything that's going to be new to 8thStyle has been leaked to the internet yet.

588
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,420
[SPEAKER_04]: No TAC yet, which is kind of surprising.

589
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a crime.

590
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just thinking he's taking a little summer vacation and he'll be back.

591
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:13,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I made up a money funny.

592
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:17,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a real D-Slapper.

593
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:18,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

594
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:26,804
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, there cannot be a 2DX without my man in it.

595
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being told that also, now I thought this was rumor, but it's being brought up again, Max 3 is supposedly location testing too, but from what I had heard, somebody actually that's in Japan that posts on some of the message boards locally went to the arcade that's supposedly location testing and didn't see it.

596
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:50,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bet it's probably one of those cases where it's going to be really soon we're going to start hearing the Max 3 location tests if it's not already out, but we haven't heard anything yet.

597
00:46:51,217 --> 00:47:15,010
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, 2DX, 8style, location testing To me, it sounds very much like 5Key music And obviously that's a big duh, because they're both Beatmania And a lot of the 5Key artists, now that Beatmania the final is gone Don't really have a resource, so they're going to have to go to 2DX to put their songs in I think it kind of sounds a lot like the music in 6, plus core to me

598
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, way off topic here since you mentioned Max 3.

599
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:26,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard actually that one of the songs, Crash, that's going to be on Max 3 is actually a heavy metal song, which is kind of cool.

600
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:28,301
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be interesting.

601
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:31,062
[SPEAKER_24]: But back to 8th Style, I mean, think about it.

602
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:34,824
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like a lot of the Keyboard Mania 4th Mix rumored thing.

603
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:42,707
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of those artists were saved and brought into 6th Style, like Frozen Ray and a bunch of other 6th Style songs that you know should have been Keyboard Mania but aren't.

604
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:52,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was always kind of my thought, especially if you, uh, the one song, Deutz de Fatima by Osama Kubota is not Douche de Fatima, is that what you're calling it?

605
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:52,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

606
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:55,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was Douche de, whatever it's called.

607
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:57,236
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's really French, it's Dwatz.

608
00:47:57,256 --> 00:47:57,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dwatz.

609
00:47:58,277 --> 00:47:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Dwatz?

610
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, uh, Dwatz de Fatima.

611
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Dwatz de, whatever.

612
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever the hell it's called.

613
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:05,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know what song I'm talking about by this one.

614
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one that goes, that song.

615
00:48:09,477 --> 00:48:13,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Does not sound like ever a 2DX song ever, but it sounds like Keyboard Mania to me.

616
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:17,224
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why I think it's French, by the way, is because that's French for right.

617
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:21,969
[SPEAKER_24]: But Fatima is Portuguese and Latin for marry.

618
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:22,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured out what it is.

619
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:25,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured out what it is.

620
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:30,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a bunch of languages and they butchered them all and they stuck them in one together and fucking shit, cock, cunt, suck, fault.

621
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me that.

622
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:37,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the actual licensed songs that they were talking about for 8th style, like Daft Punk and that kind of stuff?

623
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:39,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know.

624
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:44,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Location tests don't usually have licensed songs in them, so we don't know.

625
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:53,685
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah, Team Guilo, before they went down, they rumored to put on Apex Twins' Girl Boy song as one of the test songs for 8th style.

626
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:57,068
[SPEAKER_24]: And if that is true, then I would, like, die.

627
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:58,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Because that's, like, one of the coolest songs ever.

628
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they took somebody's, you know, little files for their home version and stuck it in the arcade to test it.

629
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What, how they tested the 8th style?

630
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:08,959
[SPEAKER_04]: How they got those MP3s?

631
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:10,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I was joking.

632
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:14,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I really have nothing to say about that.

633
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then why did you take the microphone, honestly?

634
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:41,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she knew you'd take it eventually.

635
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:44,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, he's such a mic whore.

636
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:48,658
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to get him a little headset like Matt had the first two weeks.

637
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:50,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for calling Orange Lounge.

638
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:51,859
[SPEAKER_07]: May you help me?

639
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just have to put you on hold until you can learn to speak in a more professional manner.

640
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:00,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he worked in the call center for two years.

641
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,823
[SPEAKER_04]: 2DX8Style, what else did I want to say about it?

642
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: There was something.

643
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:06,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's special!

644
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a special.

645
00:50:08,764 --> 00:50:09,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new!

646
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:11,405
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me tingle.

647
00:50:12,805 --> 00:50:13,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Down there?

648
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:14,406
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

649
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:16,526
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the show's for.

650
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it like dolphin blue?

651
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Or head and shoulders?

652
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes my scalp sparkle.

653
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:27,569
[SPEAKER_04]: How about any other songs you guys liked for those of you that have heard all of the 8Style tracks to date?

654
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Dancer's pretty fucking cool.

655
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

656
00:50:30,824 --> 00:50:31,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancer rules!

657
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:41,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's like something you'd expect more in Guitar Freak's drum mania, but it kind of reminds me of Kiriyama Oka's Diamond Jealousy, which I really like.

658
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

659
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:43,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go.

660
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

661
00:50:45,617 --> 00:50:46,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Meltdown!

662
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:46,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Meltdown!

663
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:51,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a bunch more Eurobeat, because I thought the sixth style was 2DX Parapara edition.

664
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I should hit the keys or start waving my hands around.

665
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

666
00:50:56,752 --> 00:50:56,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

667
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:57,593
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this microphone?

668
00:50:57,713 --> 00:50:57,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

669
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, Sal?

670
00:50:58,553 --> 00:50:59,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

671
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,315
[SPEAKER_07]: We have taunting going on.

672
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:05,537
[SPEAKER_24]: The new Naoki song actually sounded really good.

673
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:06,358
[SPEAKER_24]: I forget.

674
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:07,839
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the one that's got...

675
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:10,243
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not polytery!

676
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:11,564
[SPEAKER_24]: And everybody cheers!

677
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:13,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not polytery!

678
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:34,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The song in the background, Youthful Urges, also known as Blue Impulse.

679
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:36,453
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the Naoki.

680
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:43,715
[SPEAKER_04]: For once, he ditched Politary and went with somebody named Yuki.

681
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:44,755
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

682
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:48,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not starting the Politary debate again on this show.

683
00:51:53,117 --> 00:51:54,998
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it's not Politary, I'm a happy girl.

684
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:58,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I... What?

685
00:51:58,579 --> 00:51:58,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes?

686
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:01,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna choke on this microphone right now.

687
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:26,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened, weren't they supposed to get another chick for Dive?

688
00:52:26,952 --> 00:52:29,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when DDR Max came out, you know how Dive has four people?

689
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:31,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't they going to get a fifth person?

690
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:32,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened with that?

691
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:34,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Polite Jerry killed her.

692
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:41,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess somebody realized, oh, I'm sorry, what the hell am I saying?

693
00:52:41,445 --> 00:52:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, a fifth girl for Dive.

694
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:44,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking B for You, not Dive.

695
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:45,129
[SPEAKER_04]: B for You sings Dive.

696
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:46,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Be4U.

697
00:52:46,573 --> 00:52:49,514
[SPEAKER_04]: They were supposed to get a fifth chick in Be4U, and that didn't happen.

698
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:54,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary scalped her, wore her scalp, and just, like, started singing Be4U songs.

699
00:52:55,138 --> 00:53:00,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that one person had left, and they got a replacement, so that would make it to four again, right?

700
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:04,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's actually what happened, but the thing is, I always thought that Naoki would just cross-dress and do it.

701
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:05,564
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:53:05,904 --> 00:53:07,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody thinks Naoki's a woman anyway.

703
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but Naoki's pretty good looking.

704
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:11,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a woman.

705
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Naoki is a very pretty man.

706
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:13,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Naoki...

707
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:16,768
[SPEAKER_04]: The Aoki is about as ambiguous as Gackt.

708
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:17,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.

709
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:19,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, he's pretty too.

710
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Gackt is funny.

711
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is in the chat room.

712
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a line.

713
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:28,114
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a line here.

714
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:29,995
[SPEAKER_07]: According to Irene, he's Hodor-y.

715
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:32,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Align here in the chatroom.

716
00:53:32,515 --> 00:53:33,776
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a great Oni course.

717
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Naoki not featuring Politary.

718
00:53:37,399 --> 00:53:37,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

719
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the best non-stop course ever.

720
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:40,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Who said that?

721
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:40,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Who said that?

722
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:42,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That was DarkTetsuya, our friend.

723
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:44,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, DT, you like our winner now.

724
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:45,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you sorry?

725
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:48,448
Oh, I got an idea.

726
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:49,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an idea.

727
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:52,051
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Politary course, not featuring Naoki?

728
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:53,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be her singing.

729
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:54,513
[SPEAKER_02]: No music, nothing.

730
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:57,255
[SPEAKER_02]: God, then we can really tell how terrible she is.

731
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:57,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I cry.

732
00:53:57,395 --> 00:53:58,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Player's worst.

733
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:01,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the first winner.

734
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:02,332
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean loser, actually.

735
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

736
00:54:35,816 --> 00:54:36,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

737
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:46,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, because we're seeing lots of people coming into the chatroom now, and you want to join the party, just go to Channel Orange Lounge.

738
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:49,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mr. DJ.

739
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, inside joke.

740
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:57,148
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join the Orange Lounge party, just join Channel Orange Lounge.

741
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:58,729
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a party in my pants.

742
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

743
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:08,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other side IRC server, it's listed on your MIRC list of servers.

744
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:13,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Bongo is demanding to hear some Politary.

745
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:15,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Bongo, shove it.

746
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, Bongo.

747
00:55:18,338 --> 00:55:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Bongo, we must marry.

748
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I will allow you to date with me.

749
00:55:24,261 --> 00:55:26,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go smite Brad now.

750
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Pop!

751
00:55:28,402 --> 00:55:30,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to Orange on Radio.

752
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:34,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Bongo demands it.

753
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:46,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Bongo.

754
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,017
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were a bouncer at Club Top Academy, you'd get laid.

755
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're going into all sorts of inside jokes on this show, and people are just kind of probably looking at this going, train wreck.

756
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, we kind of already have that reputation, I'm sure.

757
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've got people listening, so apparently it's not that bad.

758
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:01,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we just had one drop.

759
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, pantsless rage.

760
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: 3-2 Debbie.

761
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:07,363
[SPEAKER_07]: We need ratings.

762
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:08,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That only worked last week, dear.

763
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, oh, that does make me think, though.

764
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:13,045
[SPEAKER_04]: DDRPC.

765
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to play it a little more.

766
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:19,284
[SPEAKER_04]: and unlocked some new... We were talking last week about hacking the characters.

767
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, some new characters that are unlocked in TDRPC.

768
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:28,190
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a character called Brother, who's a... Shaft!

769
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,951
[SPEAKER_04]: He pretty much... Shut your mouth!

770
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a cross between Shaft and Jam Jam Reggae, pretty much.

771
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,314
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole little reggae hat thing.

772
00:56:35,574 --> 00:56:36,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And his name's Brother.

773
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:38,136
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a brother.

774
00:56:38,456 --> 00:56:38,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Brother.

775
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:43,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other unlockable characters are Ruby and Sapphire, which are...

776
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:48,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty much, they kind of look like... Aren't those Sailor Moon characters or something?

777
00:56:48,763 --> 00:56:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

778
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:49,783
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

779
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,644
[SPEAKER_07]: But it looks like... I don't think there's a Ruby Moon in Cardi B or Sakura.

780
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of looks like a cowboy and a cowgirl.

781
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:57,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Ruby and Sapphire is kind of what they look like.

782
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:58,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Sapphire's a guy?

783
00:56:58,486 --> 00:56:58,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

784
00:56:58,867 --> 00:56:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Sapphire's a boy.

785
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:00,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Falky!

786
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:01,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

787
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:04,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one of the other unlockable characters is Pink-Haired Emmy.

788
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:06,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, not Emmy, Pink-Haired Lady.

789
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:07,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely.

790
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,491
[SPEAKER_04]: She's from Second Mix or something.

791
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if you're in the chat room right now, SoCalKicks on his lovely little site at SoCalKicks.com has some articles with pictures if you want to go see.

792
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:22,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that because I gave him the picture of Brother.

793
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:25,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And Angel Zukin.

794
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:31,869
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually speaking of SoCalKicks, I think it's about time for me to once again repeat the challenge.

795
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, go for it.

796
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:34,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

797
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of my edits can be found on his page, I hope still.

798
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:43,794
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, send an email to orangelounge at yahoo.com.

799
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:45,996
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeloungeRadio at yahoo.com.

800
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

801
00:57:48,238 --> 00:57:55,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will get you the Dex files for it for my Look to the Sky edit called Free Fall.

802
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,847
[SPEAKER_07]: The first person to send me proof... Excuse me, Mr. SoCalKicks.

803
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner for you!

804
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:29,479
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

805
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:56,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

806
00:58:57,984 --> 00:58:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hurt yourself?

807
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:01,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have an injury.

808
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:03,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need a band-aid?

809
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:04,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need some vodka?

810
00:59:04,347 --> 00:59:04,748
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need?

811
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:07,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay.

812
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm okay.

813
00:59:10,351 --> 00:59:13,712
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKick, send me a private message with your email and I'll make sure Matt gets it.

814
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:16,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Matt has an assload of edits.

815
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really no other way to describe it.

816
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:18,935
[SPEAKER_04]: He just has an assload of edits.

817
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:22,657
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got like J-Lo's leftover ass of edits.

818
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:25,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything they took off of Ricky Lake, he's got in edits.

819
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:27,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I just killed the show.

820
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:28,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

821
00:59:28,813 --> 00:59:29,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

822
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,494
[SPEAKER_07]: That was wrong.

823
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:33,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, why don't we take a break now?

824
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:35,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, break.

825
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:38,716
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I say I was going to play this break?

826
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:40,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I said I'd play Jack and Mark Get Busy.

827
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:41,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

828
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:44,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's do another 8-style song.

829
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:49,200
[SPEAKER_04]: How about... No, I want to do... Let's do Rainbow.

830
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we want to do the Naoki song?

831
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:50,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

832
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:52,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

833
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,702
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get that in there and some other crap.

834
00:59:55,303 --> 00:59:55,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy.

835
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

836
00:59:57,048 --> 00:59:58,970
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

837
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:32,914
Thanks for watching!

838
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,069
Thanks for watching!

839
01:03:59,267 --> 01:03:59,788
Rokkata!

840
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:00,188
Toshiki!

841
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:00,588
Jojo!

842
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:00,948
Miyato!

843
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:30,647
[SPEAKER_10]: The King!

844
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,171
[SPEAKER_10]: JoJo!

845
01:05:15,402 --> 01:05:21,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Dome's been-running music in more shows?

846
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:28,478
[SPEAKER_00]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

847
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unearthly.

848
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:34,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

849
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,331
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

850
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,741
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room, they seem to think Lab's okay.

851
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't really care for Dancer, though.

852
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: They disagree with Brad and Irene in that respect.

853
01:06:01,842 --> 01:06:04,823
[SPEAKER_04]: But Brad and Irene went home, so they are not here to defend themselves.

854
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the chat room wins that one.

855
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:07,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can say this.

856
01:06:07,724 --> 01:06:08,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Politary sucks!

857
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:10,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate her!

858
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:11,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Die, die, die!

859
01:06:11,605 --> 01:06:12,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we're kind of...

860
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:19,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

861
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:19,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for pizza.

862
01:06:30,776 --> 01:06:33,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And this yay for pizza was brought to you by Propel Water, put out by Gatorade.

863
01:06:33,977 --> 01:06:41,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to let Matt give a sim update, but he left to go get pizza, so now I'm stuck with nothing.

864
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to tell Potty Joke.

865
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I will give the sim update.

866
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:49,523
[SPEAKER_07]: The best way to kill sims is to put them in a pool and remove the ladder.

867
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:51,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being sent files.

868
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:53,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is a good thing or not.

869
01:06:53,324 --> 01:06:54,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll find out here.

870
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also teach sims how to barbecue.

871
01:06:56,915 --> 01:07:01,796
[SPEAKER_07]: and then if you give them a low personality rating, when they set themselves on fire, nobody will come to help them.

872
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:05,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to know what SoCalKick sent me this file for.

873
01:07:05,677 --> 01:07:08,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a picture of his cable provider or something.

874
01:07:09,178 --> 01:07:09,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they exploding?

875
01:07:10,478 --> 01:07:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet.

876
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:13,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It says his picture.

877
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:15,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at... Jeez.

878
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:18,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

879
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:18,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

880
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:19,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a thingy.

881
01:07:21,132 --> 01:07:23,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give any more shoutouts to any of your friends that are listening?

882
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:25,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, hi people who are listening.

883
01:07:26,097 --> 01:07:28,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I see some new faces in the chatroom tonight, very cool.

884
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we never have a look.

885
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:31,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi people!

886
01:07:32,784 --> 01:07:36,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello people in the chatroom, you're so cute.

887
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:38,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to eat them all up.

888
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow, hey.

889
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:41,532
[SPEAKER_07]: With some fava beans.

890
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:42,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And a fine Chianti.

891
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:44,874
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

892
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:32,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see a short girl wearing glasses come out of the Star Trek experience all fucked up That is the best place to get drunk in Vegas, by the way You'll know who had the Warp Core Breach You know you're a geek when That was, you know, sad but true, that was the first place I ever got really fucked up I love the Warp Core Breach The Star Trek experience on a Warp Core Breach Which for those that don't know It doesn't last, though For those that don't know, seven different kinds of Bacardi Sobe and Razzmatazz, all mixed in a fishbowl And some really freaking good juices mixed in with it, too And dry ice

893
01:08:33,186 --> 01:08:39,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamie will not, unfortunately, be with us in a couple weeks, but we will somehow survive and the show will go on.

894
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows, maybe I'll be the one.

895
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:46,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt's been dying to co-host a show, and I think he's been here every week since week one.

896
01:08:46,714 --> 01:08:47,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

897
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let Matt co-host a show for once.

898
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Matt's back.

899
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:53,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Matt, want to give us a sim update?

900
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:53,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you too busy?

901
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us finish chewing.

902
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Swallow, Matt, swallow.

903
01:08:59,378 --> 01:08:59,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

904
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

905
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:00,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

906
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, as of today, see, there's a new DWI that just came out.

907
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:05,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's 2.01.

908
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:08,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly fixed some stuff.

909
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:12,993
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing they added is percentages on the score screen.

910
01:09:13,273 --> 01:09:17,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you hit the upper left button, I believe it should put up percentages.

911
01:09:17,477 --> 01:09:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And very...

912
01:09:19,758 --> 01:09:21,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting kind of close there.

913
01:09:21,339 --> 01:09:22,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it can hold 2048, so...

914
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:33,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those that don't believe him, I will vouch for this.

915
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:36,407
[SPEAKER_04]: His sim has so many freaking songs in it.

916
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It was damn near pushing that number, yes.

917
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty much what's going on there.

918
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:49,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that's pretty cool is DDR Maniacs, I think I might have mentioned it last week, is doing the user submitted files now.

919
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:55,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the files that they have on there is Ooh La La from Dancing Stage 1-5, the beta, I believe.

920
01:09:56,298 --> 01:10:03,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the original songs that was going to be on Dancing Stage Euromix that was actually going to have three arrows at one time on there.

921
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:05,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Or four, I can't remember.

922
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet, but...

923
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually going to be one of the songs that was supposed to be on DDR a long time ago.

924
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

925
01:10:12,245 --> 01:10:13,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for that.

926
01:10:13,146 --> 01:10:13,566
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

927
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:14,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It just didn't make it in DDR?

928
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't make it.

929
01:10:15,747 --> 01:10:17,228
[SPEAKER_03]: There was three songs that got cut.

930
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:21,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there was one by Run DMC also, so they all got cut.

931
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:23,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

932
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:30,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And Team Guilo is still down, very sad, and that also means that DDR PC Central is also down, or the Melting Pot.

933
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:31,877
[SPEAKER_04]: A moment of silence, please.

934
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:33,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

935
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:39,691
[SPEAKER_03]: and also Tourney Mix 2 on DDR East Coast Invasion.

936
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll probably start seeing the files pretty soon because they said they're releasing them on the 15th.

937
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So, probably this week.

938
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:45,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

939
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:46,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the 15th is this week.

940
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:47,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

941
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:48,836
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make sense.

942
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:50,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

943
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:52,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that lovely update on the sim scene.

944
01:10:53,911 --> 01:10:54,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to potty jokes.

945
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Poop!

946
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

947
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:57,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ass!

948
01:10:58,973 --> 01:11:10,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody suggested a good idea in the chat room that maybe you want to beg and plead anybody that might be coming through Sacramento that's going to the big tournament in Concord this weekend, you know, about your situation.

949
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:18,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if anybody can give me a ride to Concord, hey, I'll pay for a gas lunch.

950
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:19,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey.

951
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:26,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't think you're capable of getting that look to the sky edit done, you don't think you're ever going to combo that.

952
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:29,894
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to get as nice of a lunch for the another edit.

953
01:11:30,254 --> 01:11:31,855
[SPEAKER_07]: The another edit's going to have a nice lunch.

954
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:32,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the another edit.

955
01:11:32,836 --> 01:11:38,421
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't think you're going to be able to full combo the another edit anytime soon, come get Jamie and take her to Concord, because she needs it.

956
01:11:38,702 --> 01:11:39,222
[SPEAKER_04]: She needs a ride.

957
01:11:39,242 --> 01:11:39,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you pizza.

958
01:11:43,285 --> 01:11:46,926
[SPEAKER_04]: The big tournament in Concord, we'll give a shout out to this, because DarkSound's our buddy.

959
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:52,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's doing a little tourney, putting together one on Saturday in Concord.

960
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Dollar Mendy's Summer Vacation, I believe it's called.

961
01:11:56,189 --> 01:11:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sure to be exciting.

962
01:11:58,429 --> 01:11:59,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the very first...

963
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:02,444
[SPEAKER_04]: One, broadcast over the internet.

964
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:04,785
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a little streaming thing going on there.

965
01:12:06,046 --> 01:12:11,089
[SPEAKER_07]: If I recall the page correctly, it's tunak.floop.net.

966
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:12,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not sure.

967
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,150
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably it.

968
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:13,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like it to me.

969
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:25,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also, on the tournament's discussion thread, I'm sorry, not thread, but forum on DDR Freak, there is a link to the page and some feedback on what's going on.

970
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:26,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

971
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:29,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the best freestyle category ever.

972
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Waste of two minutes of my life and I want it back.

973
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:33,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

974
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,644
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the one I would enter if I were to enter freestyle.

975
01:12:36,664 --> 01:12:37,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You would have to bat.

976
01:12:38,245 --> 01:12:39,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we should get the bats.

977
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking the bat to bang people over the head with.

978
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:43,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

979
01:12:58,058 --> 01:13:00,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be involved on another level, but I don't know yet.

980
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:03,663
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still dotting our I's and crossing our T's on that.

981
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:05,625
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know yet.

982
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay close attention to the station.

983
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:10,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay close attention to our website the next few days.

984
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:13,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You may find some interesting news, but I don't know yet.

985
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

986
01:13:14,212 --> 01:13:16,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have our people call their people and all that stuff.

987
01:13:19,335 --> 01:13:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: but we know for sure we'll at least be covering it because Jamie's going to be going to the tournament assuming she gets a ride and doing some interviews.

988
01:13:25,178 --> 01:13:26,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get there one way or another.

989
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:29,861
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be doing her woman on the street interviews.

990
01:13:32,082 --> 01:13:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

991
01:13:32,763 --> 01:13:33,523
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have Bradley do interviews.

992
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:34,664
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have Bradley do interviews.

993
01:13:35,288 --> 01:13:54,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my idea for Bradley because Bradley Bradley kind of gets the rep on the show for not talking much I think I would like Bradley to do the interviews like at Golfland with the people who just look really scary and don't do anything with Bomani I'd love to get a microphone in front of Bradley and make him interview those people that would be fun won't you think Bradley?

994
01:13:56,097 --> 01:14:04,541
[SPEAKER_03]: no comment fair enough Matt has something he wants to say after I'm done chewing here but anyways swallow Matt swallow

995
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:08,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, glad I got that down.

996
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Jamie, I hate to do this to myself since I've pushed it back three weeks now.

997
01:14:17,655 --> 01:14:18,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn Cusar trip.

998
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:23,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be able to give you a ride down the concrete.

999
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:30,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and do that, maybe push it back another week or so, or just stick with this to seven, and we'll go then.

1000
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just give you a ride down there.

1001
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:37,401
[SPEAKER_07]: You officially get the My Hero of the Year award.

1002
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:38,183
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's for Matt.

1003
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:38,824
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's for Matt.

1004
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:41,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1005
01:14:44,058 --> 01:14:45,538
[SPEAKER_07]: That just really gets my heart.

1006
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:50,461
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take another really quick break because I'm selfish and I have to pee.

1007
01:14:50,942 --> 01:14:52,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So we take a break when I have to pee.

1008
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have gone before we left.

1009
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:56,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I can just get up and go.

1010
01:14:56,265 --> 01:14:57,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Go pee!

1011
01:14:57,846 --> 01:14:58,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

1012
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Jamie show now.

1013
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:00,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

1014
01:15:00,888 --> 01:15:02,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I have both of the mics in my hand.

1015
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give the microphone to the microphone whore.

1016
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:11,384
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that'll probably make some weird echo if you're talking in both mics at once or not.

1017
01:15:12,044 --> 01:15:15,267
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um... Someone wants to get fucked.

1018
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:17,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to get fucked?

1019
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, who wants to get fucked?

1020
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone in the chatroom wants to get fucked.

1021
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:21,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, who's he talking about?

1022
01:15:21,932 --> 01:15:24,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Sukkot Kix, dude, who are you talking, who wants to get fucked?

1023
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:25,936
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, come on.

1024
01:15:26,616 --> 01:15:27,337
[SPEAKER_07]: He just says yes.

1025
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:28,935
[SPEAKER_25]: You wanna get fucked?

1026
01:15:29,535 --> 01:15:29,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1027
01:15:29,895 --> 01:15:31,076
[SPEAKER_07]: He wants to get some!

1028
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:34,219
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1029
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:42,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know what, I think actually at this point, you know, perhaps it might be in our best interest to, uh... Take a break?

1030
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:46,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to break, but in the meantime, why don't you, uh, give your Bitmoney experience of the week?

1031
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:50,072
[SPEAKER_24]: My Bitmoney experience of... I PASSED A CATA, DAMMIT!

1032
01:15:50,653 --> 01:15:56,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did, finally, it's a real one, it's actual, it's not like burning the floor, which is like a fake cata, you know...

1033
01:15:57,078 --> 01:15:58,559
[SPEAKER_24]: This one's actually Kakumei.

1034
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Burning the Floor is a 7.

1035
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:01,801
[SPEAKER_24]: It just jumped up to a kata.

1036
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:02,682
[SPEAKER_24]: You know it's not a kata.

1037
01:16:03,222 --> 01:16:04,043
[SPEAKER_24]: We know it's not a kata.

1038
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:07,565
[SPEAKER_24]: But damn it, Kakumei shouldn't be a kata, but is a kata.

1039
01:16:07,785 --> 01:16:09,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we're going to break right now.

1040
01:16:09,807 --> 01:16:11,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though Rob has now finished peeing.

1041
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:13,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad, it's my turn and we're going to break.

1042
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:16,271
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe Executive Decision is coming to play.

1043
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:17,772
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll be back after these.

1044
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:19,868
[SPEAKER_07]: This song or so.

1045
01:16:19,888 --> 01:16:20,568
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we playing now?

1046
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:22,949
[SPEAKER_07]: This potty break is brought to you by Propel Water.

1047
01:16:23,269 --> 01:16:24,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Fitness water from Gatorade.

1048
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,071
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, whatever.

1049
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:52,825
It's time to scream it!

1050
01:16:52,885 --> 01:16:55,146
It's time to scream it!

1051
01:16:55,226 --> 01:16:56,727
It's time to scream it!

1052
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:57,647
Put it on!

1053
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:58,327
Put it on!

1054
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:58,927
Come on!

1055
01:16:58,987 --> 01:16:59,448
Get it!

1056
01:16:59,468 --> 01:16:59,908
Come on!

1057
01:16:59,928 --> 01:17:00,588
Get it!

1058
01:17:00,688 --> 01:17:01,729
Keep on pushing harder!

1059
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:02,169
Put it on!

1060
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:02,729
Put it on!

1061
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1062
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:11,699
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1063
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:40,247
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1064
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:02,273
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1065
01:19:31,403 --> 01:19:34,284
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1066
01:20:22,316 --> 01:20:23,719
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1067
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,676
[SPEAKER_22]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1068
01:21:03,976 --> 01:21:04,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1069
01:21:14,352 --> 01:21:15,333
[SPEAKER_21]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1070
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:57,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1071
01:21:57,484 --> 01:21:59,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1072
01:21:59,226 --> 01:21:59,626
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1073
01:22:02,008 --> 01:22:03,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we trouble people finger-bush?

1074
01:22:03,889 --> 01:22:05,791
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1075
01:22:05,811 --> 01:22:07,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1076
01:22:07,712 --> 01:22:09,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1077
01:22:11,755 --> 01:22:13,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Extreme Babani Radio.

1078
01:22:13,837 --> 01:22:16,639
[SPEAKER_12]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1079
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:18,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I say we let him go!

1080
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

1081
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:22,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.

1082
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:24,414
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still here.

1083
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm back.

1084
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:26,835
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got pee-pee.

1085
01:22:27,195 --> 01:22:28,356
[SPEAKER_04]: My bladder is empty, thank you.

1086
01:22:29,596 --> 01:22:30,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking over the show there.

1087
01:22:31,978 --> 01:22:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know I can take a week off and leave the show in good hands.

1088
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:40,061
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just have you in here.

1089
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some fans in the chatroom who are sick of our old promos, who are threatening to make new ones.

1090
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:47,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1091
01:22:47,606 --> 01:22:49,368
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear some fan-made promos.

1092
01:22:49,408 --> 01:22:50,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be funny.

1093
01:22:50,609 --> 01:22:53,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I just question, you know, if you're a fan of the show, let's get your voice on the station somehow.

1094
01:22:53,892 --> 01:22:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everybody's show.

1095
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We want everybody to be a part of this show.

1096
01:22:57,676 --> 01:22:59,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the call-in capabilities yet.

1097
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a party on our show and everyone's coming.

1098
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:07,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we're looking for for the future is hopefully we can get some phone calls into the show.

1099
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately that takes a kind of complex...

1100
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:11,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that would go.

1101
01:23:25,379 --> 01:23:25,820
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1102
01:23:48,183 --> 01:23:50,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, the original version of Gentle Stress.

1103
01:23:50,245 --> 01:23:52,328
[SPEAKER_04]: From 2DX, or... Yes, that's in our playlist.

1104
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then the AMD Sexual mix of Gentle Stress.

1105
01:23:55,551 --> 01:23:56,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Give the mic back to Jamie now, please.

1106
01:23:59,135 --> 01:23:59,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong!

1107
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:02,419
[SPEAKER_07]: You win absolutely nothing!

1108
01:24:04,012 --> 01:24:07,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Good suggestion from the chatroom, would an AOL Instant Messenger talk work?

1109
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:12,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I think actually it would, but not very well.

1110
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:14,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure if I want to try that just yet.

1111
01:24:15,002 --> 01:24:18,705
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to test it out with Yahoo Chat because you can't have multiple people.

1112
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:25,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we do tests late at night when you guys aren't expecting it and we'll go live suddenly.

1113
01:24:25,992 --> 01:24:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty soon Jamie's going to be doing her own just spur-of-the-moment live shows.

1114
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I've been planning on playing non-stops in J-Rock.

1115
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that Tech TV uses some sort of program for webcasting or something like that.

1116
01:24:41,002 --> 01:24:44,084
[SPEAKER_03]: You might check in and see if they use the same program, see what they use.

1117
01:24:44,304 --> 01:24:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we need to get this show on television.

1118
01:24:45,904 --> 01:24:46,565
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

1119
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:47,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1120
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's write those people a letter to Tech TV.

1121
01:24:50,446 --> 01:24:54,008
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that new station, G4 or whatever, all about video game talk?

1122
01:24:54,568 --> 01:24:54,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1123
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:58,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Konami would ever let us do this show on there, though?

1124
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:03,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea if Konami even knows we exist.

1125
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:04,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I would doubt it.

1126
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would think, though, that if we did maybe something about all music games, which we pretty much do anyway.

1127
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:11,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about all sorts of music games on the show.

1128
01:25:11,734 --> 01:25:12,514
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all-encompassing.

1129
01:25:12,694 --> 01:25:14,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happens to be Bomania's game right now.

1130
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:16,336
[SPEAKER_24]: When was the last time you talked about Pump It Up?

1131
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:19,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about Pump It Up right now.

1132
01:25:20,737 --> 01:25:22,058
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it at the Folsom Game Room.

1133
01:25:23,038 --> 01:25:23,238
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1134
01:25:23,278 --> 01:25:24,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at Folsom Game Room.

1135
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:24,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did I say that?

1136
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking of, you know, out in the boonies.

1137
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any Pump It Up in Sacramento?

1138
01:25:30,081 --> 01:25:30,761
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Florin Mall.

1139
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:31,462
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

1140
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:32,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Where the hell is Florin Mall?

1141
01:25:32,322 --> 01:25:32,862
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Tilt.

1142
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Ghetto Gate.

1143
01:25:34,283 --> 01:25:34,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1144
01:25:35,123 --> 01:25:38,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Florin Mall is in the Ghetto.

1145
01:25:39,745 --> 01:25:42,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just there yesterday to get my booba.

1146
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:48,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, see, Pump It Up is a cool game that doesn't get much respect from people because it sucks.

1147
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:50,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And does it suck?

1148
01:25:51,465 --> 01:25:52,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I mean, it hurts to play.

1149
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,767
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to pound those damn keys.

1150
01:25:55,168 --> 01:25:55,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Not really.

1151
01:25:56,749 --> 01:25:59,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, every Pump It Up machine I've played, you've had to pound all the keys.

1152
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:05,314
[SPEAKER_24]: Especially with their gimpy freeze arrows and that whole five arrow pad.

1153
01:26:05,775 --> 01:26:10,358
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, it's almost like the Simpsons and Springfield and Shelbyville.

1154
01:26:10,718 --> 01:26:16,842
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, everything that Pump It Up is is like utterly foreign and wrong in every way, shape, and form.

1155
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1156
01:26:37,612 --> 01:26:38,513
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't know.

1157
01:26:38,553 --> 01:26:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't get as obsessive with it as I do with DDR.

1158
01:26:41,856 --> 01:26:43,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't sit here for two hours and talk about it.

1159
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, we're having a hard time as it is sitting here for two hours talking about DDR.

1160
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,141
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pump It Up, I don't know.

1161
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's not the same.

1162
01:26:50,182 --> 01:26:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same.

1163
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:56,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what if they got rid of, say, I don't know, the Sumo and put in a Pump It Up machine?

1164
01:26:56,387 --> 01:26:57,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play it.

1165
01:26:57,488 --> 01:26:58,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like...

1166
01:26:59,207 --> 01:27:00,567
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it's like Guitar Freaks.

1167
01:27:00,607 --> 01:27:04,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never going to be that good at it, and I'm not going to play it a whole hell of a lot, but it's fun to do once in a while.

1168
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:06,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't leave it next to the Parapara machine.

1169
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would suck.

1170
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:14,411
[SPEAKER_24]: But now, having a pump-it-up machine would be a good idea at RBGL, mainly because it's just, it's good to have, you know, change.

1171
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:26,275
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I sat down and learned to play Drum Mania, that's why I learned to play Keyboard Mania, because it sucks to sit there and freaking wait ten years for your turn at DDR Max, because no one in their right mind is going to play USA, I mean, let's be real here.

1172
01:27:26,295 --> 01:27:26,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

1173
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:30,981
[SPEAKER_24]: But playing Pump It Up is at least, like, that's why I like San Jose Golf Club.

1174
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:37,613
[SPEAKER_24]: I can go play Pump It Up, I can go play Max, play Soul Calibur 2, and go back and forth between the three, right?

1175
01:27:38,382 --> 01:27:50,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what my secret hope was for the longest time is that they would take the neat cabinet with the widescreen monitor like Pump It Up has and do a DDR with that kind of setup.

1176
01:27:51,773 --> 01:28:02,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like the HD monitors like 2DX has and have something look good, although it'd burn out and no one would ever want to replace it.

1177
01:28:02,802 --> 01:28:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: One other game they were bringing up in the chatroom a lot here is Technomotion, which I don't know much about, but apparently there is one up the road a little ways in Nevada.

1178
01:28:11,668 --> 01:28:14,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's an 8 or 9 panel DDR.

1179
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:16,571
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 panel DDR?

1180
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gotta be interesting, but I hear the song selection really, really, really, really sucks.

1181
01:28:21,114 --> 01:28:23,815
[SPEAKER_04]: At least Pump has some cool songs in it, but... Yes, ma'am?

1182
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:28,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I think actually they have a website you can check out.

1183
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:32,094
[SPEAKER_03]: During the game, I believe you can switch between 4, 5, or 8 panel.

1184
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:33,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there's no 9 panel.

1185
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:41,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can play that, and I think they've got some A-list stuff, like, well, one-hit wonder stuff, like, you know, Mambo No.

1186
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:44,637
[SPEAKER_03]: 5, and I think Livin' La Vida Local, and that kind of crap.

1187
01:28:44,857 --> 01:28:46,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to intervene, though, Mambo No.

1188
01:28:46,597 --> 01:28:47,838
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 on Mambo Will Go Go?

1189
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:48,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuckin' rules.

1190
01:28:50,885 --> 01:28:56,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, by the way, Rob, I was reading my EGM yesterday, and I saw something that I know you're going to love this, dude.

1191
01:28:57,110 --> 01:29:00,193
[SPEAKER_24]: You remember that tambourine game you played at AI, Shakota Tambourine?

1192
01:29:00,513 --> 01:29:01,674
[SPEAKER_24]: It's coming to home version.

1193
01:29:02,481 --> 01:29:09,044
[SPEAKER_04]: That tambourine thing is by far and wide the gayest game I have ever played in my life, is that tambourine game.

1194
01:29:09,064 --> 01:29:12,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why I immediately thought of you when I saw it.

1195
01:29:12,506 --> 01:29:14,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Stevie Nicks impersonation.

1196
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:15,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all I could do when I'm playing that game.

1197
01:29:15,527 --> 01:29:17,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, you know, like, Rhiannon.

1198
01:29:18,029 --> 01:29:19,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like shaking this tambourine.

1199
01:29:19,549 --> 01:29:20,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't date Rob.

1200
01:29:22,091 --> 01:29:23,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that old, dammit.

1201
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:28,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm old compared to you, but I'm not, well, not you, but you is in the chatroom, people.

1202
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie and I are the elders of the Sakmavani group, I know.

1203
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:34,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite your tongue.

1204
01:29:36,761 --> 01:29:40,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right, Bradley's... We're like the... He's Grandpa!

1205
01:29:40,763 --> 01:29:43,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like the den parents or something, I don't know.

1206
01:29:45,706 --> 01:29:47,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what you had in... Damn ornery kids.

1207
01:29:48,228 --> 01:29:51,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what you had in Cub Scouts, was the den mother and the den father?

1208
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,589
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have got away for it too if it wasn't for those pesky kids.

1209
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to compare this group to Cub Scouts, but anyway.

1210
01:29:57,811 --> 01:29:58,991
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not like the Cub Scouts.

1211
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:02,593
[SPEAKER_24]: But seriously, Shikoto Tambourine has got to be... Rob is right.

1212
01:30:02,693 --> 01:30:04,474
[SPEAKER_24]: It is freaking fruity as hell.

1213
01:30:04,494 --> 01:30:06,095
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to pose with that goddamn thing.

1214
01:30:06,335 --> 01:30:07,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Win it in circles and shit.

1215
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:08,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Samba de Amigo.

1216
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But Samba's kind of cool.

1217
01:30:10,597 --> 01:30:12,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do the crotch pose when they're both...

1218
01:30:12,298 --> 01:30:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch this.

1219
01:30:12,878 --> 01:30:13,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch this.

1220
01:30:37,984 --> 01:30:43,757
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite part is when it shows you, like, the little pattern, and you have to, like, shake it in a U pattern, like, around.

1221
01:30:43,797 --> 01:30:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, ooh, we're going around the world with a tambourine.

1222
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:46,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1223
01:30:48,345 --> 01:30:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making it for the home, though, don't you think?

1224
01:30:50,266 --> 01:30:53,067
[SPEAKER_24]: No, it actually, I believe it comes out this month for PlayStation 2.

1225
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already a tambourine game called Tam Tam Paradise.

1226
01:30:55,728 --> 01:30:58,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but this is the actual one, though, that AI, it's Shakoto.

1227
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:07,934
[SPEAKER_24]: It's coming, and I believe it comes with a tambourine thing, and you actually do have to shake it in a weird fucked up pattern, and it's a really retarded looking game, honest to God.

1228
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:18,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, you know what though, it does have a little bit of connection to Bomani because one of my favorite Bomani songs, My Sweet Darling, for Max is in that tambourine game.

1229
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I know because that was the only song I played because I failed it!

1230
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:23,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1231
01:31:24,023 --> 01:31:25,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to know what game pisses me off though?

1232
01:31:26,104 --> 01:31:29,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, you know, I don't ever recall hearing a tambourine playing in the background of my seat.

1233
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:29,966
[SPEAKER_24]: You're done.

1234
01:31:33,568 --> 01:31:36,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what game really pisses me off is Kraken DJ.

1235
01:31:37,552 --> 01:31:45,804
[SPEAKER_07]: The one chance I actually sat down to play Kraken, well I more like stood up to play Kraken DJ was last November at AI and I absolutely failed it.

1236
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:48,712
[SPEAKER_07]: But I saw this guy at Anime Expo.

1237
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:54,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I go in, I'm still in costume, like in these 4-inch platforms for my Mad Hatter costume.

1238
01:31:55,774 --> 01:32:00,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was this guy doing all this expert stuff on the Kraken DJ.

1239
01:32:00,155 --> 01:32:04,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And my god, I was more impressed with that than I am at most 2DX players.

1240
01:32:05,236 --> 01:32:07,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that just takes some speed there.

1241
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:11,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to scratch like that and hit the little trigger in the center.

1242
01:32:11,438 --> 01:32:12,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That was freaking awesome.

1243
01:32:14,211 --> 01:32:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackin' DJ is a very cool game.

1244
01:32:15,651 --> 01:32:17,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played it and I enjoy it a lot.

1245
01:32:18,312 --> 01:32:19,452
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not very many stages.

1246
01:32:19,472 --> 01:32:21,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of hoping they'd do a Crackin' DJ Part 2.

1247
01:32:21,753 --> 01:32:22,533
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one.

1248
01:32:22,873 --> 01:32:23,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?

1249
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:26,234
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one that was at AX, if I recall correctly.

1250
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:27,054
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1251
01:32:27,574 --> 01:32:28,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected.

1252
01:32:29,615 --> 01:32:35,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Other Bomani, not Bomani games, but they're like Bomani, that they're talking about at the chat room.

1253
01:32:35,977 --> 01:32:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The grandpa, possibly, of Bomani games, Parappa the Rapper.

1254
01:32:39,898 --> 01:32:41,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Kick Punch, it's all in the rhyme.

1255
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:43,456
[SPEAKER_04]: My guitar is in my mind!

1256
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the baby stage ruled.

1257
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:05,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, the baby stage... The baby stage used to be in... I'm so excited, I threw my pen.

1258
01:33:05,317 --> 01:33:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The baby stage used to be in Rotation Orange Lounge.

1259
01:33:07,358 --> 01:33:09,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we took it out recently, though.

1260
01:33:10,179 --> 01:33:12,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We try not to let that stuff go to death.

1261
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have a Parappa stage in Rotation.

1262
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:15,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have some Parappa 2 music coming very soon.

1263
01:33:16,922 --> 01:33:23,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, the cool part of Unjammer Lammy was when you got to play through the stages of Parappa, and you got to sit and listen to the remixes of the various songs.

1264
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:27,346
[SPEAKER_24]: But I don't think Parappa 2 had very good music at all, really.

1265
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree because the Toasty Burger song was very cool.

1266
01:33:32,623 --> 01:33:34,064
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to hear that in the next break.

1267
01:33:34,084 --> 01:33:35,824
[SPEAKER_07]: The best, though, was Sister Miss Asia.

1268
01:33:38,305 --> 01:33:40,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have the game Parappa 2, but I have the music.

1269
01:33:40,886 --> 01:33:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I obtained the music through a special source.

1270
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Hook a brother up, yo.

1271
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:47,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1272
01:33:47,849 --> 01:33:49,969
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what kind of a mic or you are the rest of the show.

1273
01:33:50,389 --> 01:33:51,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1274
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:54,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I left for a little while there.

1275
01:33:54,031 --> 01:33:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That was plenty of time for you, don't you think?

1276
01:33:56,832 --> 01:33:57,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

1277
01:33:57,998 --> 01:34:01,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one of my personal favorite music games, Vibriven.

1278
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Vibriven.

1279
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool.

1280
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else to say.

1281
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:09,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Vibriven is just the bomb.

1282
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:11,441
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play that during the next break.

1283
01:34:11,722 --> 01:34:13,142
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play a song from Vibriven for you.

1284
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:14,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to play a little bit right now?

1285
01:34:15,122 --> 01:34:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you get turned up a little.

1286
01:34:18,103 --> 01:34:21,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have Vibriven.

1287
01:34:23,104 --> 01:34:23,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.

1288
01:34:23,545 --> 01:34:23,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I was done.

1289
01:34:23,945 --> 01:34:24,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Vibriven's just cool.

1290
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:25,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1291
01:34:25,808 --> 01:34:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the little rabbit is on crack.

1292
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:30,311
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to have fun, you play Vibraban to a non-stop.

1293
01:34:31,752 --> 01:34:32,393
[SPEAKER_07]: That's insane.

1294
01:34:32,593 --> 01:34:36,415
[SPEAKER_24]: I sat down and I turned a non-stop into one track, right?

1295
01:34:36,455 --> 01:34:40,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I burned it onto a CD, and I played Vibraban to, I think, the max non-stop.

1296
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,600
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the hardest goddamn thing I think I've ever done.

1297
01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:47,143
[SPEAKER_24]: The announcer just screws up the game every time he talks.

1298
01:34:47,543 --> 01:34:47,843
[SPEAKER_24]: Vib-Ribbon

1299
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:06,440
[SPEAKER_24]: And so you've got, like, playing Max 300 is just ass.

1300
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:07,961
[SPEAKER_24]: It's absolutely horrible.

1301
01:35:09,402 --> 01:35:11,884
[SPEAKER_24]: Since the hosts seem to be busy, I'm just going to keep talking here for a second.

1302
01:35:12,024 --> 01:35:12,925
[SPEAKER_04]: No, bad idea.

1303
01:35:13,405 --> 01:35:26,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, one thing that surprised me on Vibravin when we put in, this was before Max 2, we put in Max 300, and we thought it was going to be evil, but So Deep was worse.

1304
01:35:27,697 --> 01:35:29,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So Deep was evil on Vibravin.

1305
01:35:31,981 --> 01:35:43,910
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's a bunch of other music games, though, there's Samba de Amigo, I mean, what other game can you play the Burning Rangers theme song to, or the Opa Opa song from Fantasy Zone?

1306
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:45,691
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that was awesome.

1307
01:35:46,172 --> 01:35:51,476
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I know that Samba de Amigo is sitting in the next room over, but I have yet to ever even see that game.

1308
01:35:53,598 --> 01:36:00,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do a Samba Fest after the show, but I do have to throw everyone out pretty soon after the show because I have to drive over to the bay tonight.

1309
01:36:03,264 --> 01:36:09,827
[SPEAKER_24]: And then there's, of course, the greatest game ever, Rez, which is just amazing techno music with a really gimpy shooter attached to it.

1310
01:36:10,728 --> 01:36:13,729
[SPEAKER_24]: And, I don't know, Frequency, I heard that was a music game.

1311
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:14,830
[SPEAKER_24]: I've never actually played that one.

1312
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:16,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Frequency looks pretty cool.

1313
01:36:16,091 --> 01:36:16,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Frequency's very cool.

1314
01:36:16,891 --> 01:36:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played Frequency.

1315
01:36:18,092 --> 01:36:18,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

1316
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:21,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Channel 5 Part 2 is a very nice sequel.

1317
01:36:21,251 --> 01:36:21,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes there.

1318
01:36:21,571 --> 01:36:26,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Channel 5 Part 2 just takes everything that the first game went there with and then shoots past it by a few miles.

1319
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:27,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Pudding!

1320
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Pudding.

1321
01:36:44,323 --> 01:36:49,808
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the best thing was, you know, not many people like Puyo Da.

1322
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:51,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Puyo Da.

1323
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:54,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It was basically the Puyo Puyo dancing game.

1324
01:36:54,252 --> 01:36:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we talked about earlier in the show, yes.

1325
01:36:56,133 --> 01:36:58,796
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't like the music in it, but I absolutely love the music.

1326
01:36:58,816 --> 01:36:59,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it's very cool, I remember.

1327
01:36:59,816 --> 01:37:00,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheesy J-pop, it's cool.

1328
01:37:01,358 --> 01:37:02,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheesy fun.

1329
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:07,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, any other not-Bomani games we can think of?

1330
01:37:07,723 --> 01:37:07,944
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1331
01:37:09,275 --> 01:37:13,617
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a pretty fun one on Saturn that's basically a Parappa clone called Jong Rhythm.

1332
01:37:14,237 --> 01:37:15,958
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw there was a post on it on DDR Freak.

1333
01:37:15,978 --> 01:37:17,539
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanted to respond to it, but never got to.

1334
01:37:18,419 --> 01:37:19,459
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a fun, it's like a Parappa clone.

1335
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:20,740
[SPEAKER_23]: It basically is a Parappa clone.

1336
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,662
[SPEAKER_23]: You follow along, your teacher tells you something, and then you follow along.

1337
01:37:26,311 --> 01:37:27,151
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really good music, too.

1338
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:32,173
[SPEAKER_23]: I wish I could find an album of it, because the last, the sixth stage song is really awesome.

1339
01:37:32,193 --> 01:37:36,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Too bad, I need a perfect, I want to find a perfect version, because it's a really good song.

1340
01:37:37,335 --> 01:37:38,575
[SPEAKER_23]: I wonder if it's on the internet somewhere.

1341
01:37:38,595 --> 01:37:40,996
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the game that's all audio, is it?

1342
01:37:41,536 --> 01:37:47,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there was a Saturn game that I saw in San Francisco that has absolutely no graphics, it's all audio.

1343
01:37:48,218 --> 01:37:50,939
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like the real sound game, something like that.

1344
01:37:50,959 --> 01:37:51,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's it.

1345
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, you get seeds with it.

1346
01:37:54,844 --> 01:37:57,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how about the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video?

1347
01:38:00,368 --> 01:38:02,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a place where you can get that in town.

1348
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:13,275
[SPEAKER_24]: I was looking at Sean Baby today because I was quite possibly bored out of my mind, and he was describing the Criss Cross Make Your Own Video thing, and it seems like the most retarded game ever known to man.

1349
01:38:13,736 --> 01:38:16,317
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, honest to God, that thing looks awful.

1350
01:38:17,538 --> 01:38:22,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to play for a little, little bit once the C&C Music Factory Make Your Own Music Video game.

1351
01:38:22,401 --> 01:38:22,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1352
01:38:24,222 --> 01:38:25,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to be able to play that again.

1353
01:38:26,164 --> 01:38:27,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, you know, ten years later.

1354
01:38:27,946 --> 01:38:29,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome to play that.

1355
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,711
[SPEAKER_25]: God, dude, I can't even remember them.

1356
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:35,835
[SPEAKER_25]: They were so... That sounded like 1994 or something.

1357
01:38:35,935 --> 01:38:38,198
[SPEAKER_25]: How can you forget C&C Music Factory?

1358
01:38:38,258 --> 01:38:39,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what game was absolute ass though?

1359
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did rent the Shice Girls game.

1360
01:38:43,656 --> 01:38:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Shiza?

1361
01:38:46,057 --> 01:38:47,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The Spice Girls game.

1362
01:38:47,497 --> 01:38:48,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh yes, I'm sorry, yes.

1363
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the... Dude, I have Spice World in the other room.

1364
01:38:52,398 --> 01:38:53,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started.

1365
01:38:54,258 --> 01:38:56,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway... I thought we've already covered the fact that you're gay.

1366
01:38:56,979 --> 01:38:57,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

1367
01:38:57,939 --> 01:39:02,160
[SPEAKER_07]: The game was very, very much ass.

1368
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,661
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I never played the MTV Music Generator games, although I heard that they were pretty neat.

1369
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:07,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're alright.

1370
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:08,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the computer one.

1371
01:39:09,021 --> 01:39:12,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, if we want to talk about ass, we'll talk about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's Magical Mall.

1372
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:15,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, that's not a music game.

1373
01:39:16,063 --> 01:39:19,946
[SPEAKER_07]: The king of the top of those, though, will always be the Bust a Move series.

1374
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:22,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not meaning Puzzle Bobble.

1375
01:39:22,127 --> 01:39:24,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean Bust a Move.

1376
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of Jamie's pet peeves.

1377
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:28,011
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to refer to it as Bust a Groove.

1378
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:30,153
[SPEAKER_24]: Funny, I like Bust a Groove quite a bit.

1379
01:39:30,453 --> 01:39:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You die!

1380
01:39:30,693 --> 01:39:30,853
[SPEAKER_04]: You die!

1381
01:39:30,873 --> 01:39:30,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

1382
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:31,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is interesting.

1383
01:39:37,316 --> 01:39:39,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You play Spice World but deny Britney?

1384
01:39:42,259 --> 01:39:46,281
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a difference between playing cheesy and then just looking at a slut.

1385
01:39:48,502 --> 01:39:50,403
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference between five sluts and one slut, okay?

1386
01:39:51,004 --> 01:39:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

1387
01:39:51,864 --> 01:39:53,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Four sluts and Mel C. What?

1388
01:39:53,105 --> 01:39:54,986
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean they're not drag queens?

1389
01:39:55,146 --> 01:39:57,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so sure about Ginger, but hey.

1390
01:39:58,308 --> 01:39:59,488
[SPEAKER_07]: No, she said it herself.

1391
01:39:59,508 --> 01:40:01,910
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't want to be with the group because she didn't want to look like a drag queen.

1392
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:05,637
[SPEAKER_04]: and now she can be found.

1393
01:40:05,757 --> 01:40:07,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Reign of Men in Max 2.

1394
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

1395
01:40:14,244 --> 01:40:18,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this break I'm going to play a couple songs from games that we've been referencing.

1396
01:40:18,548 --> 01:40:23,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with a song from Pump It Up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1397
01:41:06,315 --> 01:41:09,517
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1398
01:42:01,884 --> 01:42:23,621
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right, I'm in the house, here it comes, the extra, extra, feed all about it, the best burgers in town from all around, from around the world, come and get it, the line goes around like a merry-go-round, cause, uh-uh-uh, yes, you gotta, you gotta keep it.

1399
01:42:30,831 --> 01:42:32,592
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1400
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:13,550
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll cook the patties Cook the patties Serve the drinks Serve the drinks And melt the cheese Melt the cheese French the fries French the fries

1401
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:43,341
[SPEAKER_17]: On the right, guys, we got no extra.

1402
01:43:43,381 --> 01:43:45,722
[SPEAKER_17]: You watch the grill, control the flame, guys.

1403
01:43:45,742 --> 01:43:48,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Follow through, stay productive, and guys, cook those burgers.

1404
01:43:48,283 --> 01:43:48,963
Cook those burgers.

1405
01:43:48,983 --> 01:43:49,923
Turn the party over.

1406
01:43:49,943 --> 01:43:50,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Turn the party over.

1407
01:43:50,804 --> 01:43:52,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on and watch them fries.

1408
01:43:52,324 --> 01:43:53,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not speaking.

1409
01:43:53,024 --> 01:43:53,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Watch them fries.

1410
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:55,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Better execute than not.

1411
01:43:55,465 --> 01:43:55,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Better.

1412
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:24,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget the cheese, don't forget the cheese Bring on the mustard, bring on the mustard Handle it with ease, handle it with ease Burgers, burgers, it's only half of mine We cook the best, best is in line Love with a dumb embrace, it's for you to know Any which way it tastes good, you know Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut those burgers, turn the party over Cut the lettuce, don't forget the cheese

1413
01:44:36,889 --> 01:44:44,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about.

1414
01:44:44,535 --> 01:44:47,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Now go serve those burgers right now.

1415
01:44:47,457 --> 01:44:49,999
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I'm off to a good start.

1416
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:03,820
Thanks for watching!

1417
01:47:25,037 --> 01:47:26,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1418
01:47:26,999 --> 01:47:31,882
[SPEAKER_20]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1419
01:47:32,763 --> 01:47:38,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1420
01:47:39,048 --> 01:47:40,930
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1421
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:45,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1422
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:49,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you Mel B. Give me a dollar.

1423
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:52,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel B. was here in the house a couple weeks ago.

1424
01:47:52,185 --> 01:47:52,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good show.

1425
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:53,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And Melody was here too.

1426
01:47:53,787 --> 01:47:55,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Melody was here too, and hopefully they're going to be back.

1427
01:47:56,229 --> 01:47:58,332
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know when, but hopefully soon.

1428
01:48:00,336 --> 01:48:00,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Vibraman

1429
01:48:31,816 --> 01:48:34,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the original tracks that was on Viberbin.

1430
01:48:34,559 --> 01:48:37,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if I actually have the file labeled right.

1431
01:48:37,603 --> 01:48:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It is called Laughin' Beats.

1432
01:48:39,585 --> 01:48:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1433
01:48:39,885 --> 01:48:42,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know if that was the first or second stage or what, but whatever.

1434
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:45,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the original tracks from Viberbin.

1435
01:48:45,732 --> 01:48:46,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very cool.

1436
01:48:46,332 --> 01:48:50,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people in the chatroom going, oh, that would be a very interesting song in DDR.

1437
01:48:50,156 --> 01:48:52,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be a lot of BPM changes they could...

1438
01:48:53,656 --> 01:48:55,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Tempo changer out the ass.

1439
01:48:55,057 --> 01:49:02,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, Loki sat here and did a Vibraban song on his sim, and it's got some absolutely ridiculous freaking tempo changes in there.

1440
01:49:02,776 --> 01:49:04,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to correct Tal there.

1441
01:49:04,397 --> 01:49:05,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not do that song.

1442
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:08,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe... I can't even remember who did it.

1443
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:11,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It was back... It was a BMS file somewhere.

1444
01:49:11,384 --> 01:49:13,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same people did another Vib Ribbon song.

1445
01:49:14,006 --> 01:49:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was... I don't even remember what it was called now.

1446
01:49:17,449 --> 01:49:18,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Love and Peace or something like that.

1447
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:22,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, and the same people did this other song...

1448
01:49:23,775 --> 01:49:24,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was.

1449
01:49:24,896 --> 01:49:25,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really awesome, though.

1450
01:49:26,277 --> 01:49:28,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they also did, uh, what was it?

1451
01:49:28,518 --> 01:49:30,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit, whatever that song is.

1452
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, so, it wasn't me.

1453
01:49:34,482 --> 01:49:36,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really make that many songs.

1454
01:49:36,949 --> 01:49:41,671
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah, still, though, this thing sped up, slowed down at re- I mean, it does that in the game, too.

1455
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:43,192
[SPEAKER_24]: It really, really fucks with you.

1456
01:49:43,592 --> 01:49:45,753
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, the game will speed up and slow down.

1457
01:49:45,773 --> 01:49:51,735
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it'll go with the song, but it'll still, you're not expecting it, and you guys need to play this game.

1458
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:52,396
[SPEAKER_24]: It's so good.

1459
01:49:52,716 --> 01:49:54,136
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't wait till Mojiburbin comes out.

1460
01:49:54,156 --> 01:49:59,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually been re-released for, uh, the first one, though, has been re-released, I think, for PlayStation the Best, hasn't it?

1461
01:49:59,619 --> 01:49:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1462
01:50:00,299 --> 01:50:00,939
[SPEAKER_04]: To my knowledge, yes.

1463
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I have a nice original copy.

1464
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I have an original copy, too.

1465
01:50:07,441 --> 01:50:09,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Because piracy is bad.

1466
01:50:10,022 --> 01:50:13,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the original, though, isn't the best case.

1467
01:50:13,905 --> 01:50:14,685
[SPEAKER_24]: It's backwards.

1468
01:50:15,005 --> 01:50:19,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but it's not that piracy is bad so much that we couldn't figure out for the lifeless how to copy the damn game.

1469
01:50:20,228 --> 01:50:23,590
[SPEAKER_24]: And so, it only cost, I believe, 15 bucks off of NCSX.

1470
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:25,551
[SPEAKER_24]: So I went and bought it, like, that night.

1471
01:50:26,652 --> 01:50:28,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, all you gotta do is you load it up in Nero.

1472
01:50:28,392 --> 01:50:31,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um... You got it for 15 from NCSX?

1473
01:50:33,556 --> 01:50:34,676
[SPEAKER_07]: They must have dropped the price.

1474
01:50:34,897 --> 01:50:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: When I bought mine, I bought mine for $40.

1475
01:50:36,077 --> 01:50:36,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1476
01:50:37,157 --> 01:50:39,078
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's $30 right now.

1477
01:50:40,019 --> 01:50:40,639
[SPEAKER_23]: It wasn't $15.

1478
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:41,079
[SPEAKER_24]: I got it for $30.

1479
01:50:41,179 --> 01:50:41,979
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

1480
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:43,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Liar.

1481
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:44,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid $40 for mine.

1482
01:50:45,981 --> 01:50:48,062
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple other topics before we close out the show.

1483
01:50:49,371 --> 01:50:52,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Another road trip to Lodi How many animals did I walk out of there with?

1484
01:50:52,532 --> 01:50:52,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine?

1485
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:13,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to get a bag.

1486
01:51:44,112 --> 01:51:45,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we might take this road on the show in the future.

1487
01:51:46,133 --> 01:51:50,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Something they were talking about in the chat room earlier, I'm not sure if we've touched on this subject in an earlier show.

1488
01:51:50,994 --> 01:51:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to recall we might have discussed it, but favorite drink when playing Bomani games?

1489
01:51:55,316 --> 01:51:56,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we talked about this?

1490
01:51:56,516 --> 01:51:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Pocari Sweat.

1491
01:51:57,897 --> 01:51:59,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we did do this a couple weeks ago.

1492
01:51:59,237 --> 01:52:00,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there are some new drinks out.

1493
01:52:00,677 --> 01:52:02,278
[SPEAKER_04]: This Pepsi Blue, what do you think of that?

1494
01:52:02,518 --> 01:52:04,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody had Pepsi Blue?

1495
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:07,160
[SPEAKER_24]: I have something like five or six bottles of Pepsi Blue in my fridge.

1496
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,400
[SPEAKER_24]: That stuff is...

1497
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:12,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Really, really good, but you can't really drink it.

1498
01:52:12,144 --> 01:52:15,888
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't pound down a six-pack of it because you'll die of diabetes or something.

1499
01:52:16,309 --> 01:52:21,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Windex, and it kind of tastes like strawberry soda and cotton candy.

1500
01:52:21,855 --> 01:52:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the only way I can describe Pepsi Blue.

1501
01:52:23,717 --> 01:52:25,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a hybrid of the two of those.

1502
01:52:25,339 --> 01:52:28,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the fun of cotton candy was having it be dissolving and fluffy.

1503
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:29,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Crystal Pepsi was the shit.

1504
01:52:29,724 --> 01:52:31,205
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember marching in Mardi Gras.

1505
01:52:47,384 --> 01:52:47,845
[SPEAKER_07]: and Mobile.

1506
01:52:48,545 --> 01:52:52,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, everybody, I'm from the town that Mardi Gras originated in.

1507
01:52:52,209 --> 01:52:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: How many beads did you win that night?

1508
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:54,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1509
01:52:55,172 --> 01:52:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Cid Freak can just give them to us after the parade, but I digress.

1510
01:53:00,138 --> 01:53:07,305
[SPEAKER_07]: They pulled out cases of Crystal Pepsi and said, they don't make this anymore, they gave it to us for free, drink it up.

1511
01:53:09,884 --> 01:53:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Windex, tastes like you're sucking on Clorox wipes

1512
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:26,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I take issue with that comment.

1513
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:29,826
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, oh my god, Jamie's hawking up over here.

1514
01:53:30,866 --> 01:53:32,567
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, I take issue with that comment.

1515
01:53:32,587 --> 01:53:34,127
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's a good soda.

1516
01:53:34,267 --> 01:53:35,488
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just too sweet.

1517
01:53:35,948 --> 01:53:38,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Drink one a day or something, maybe at most, you know.

1518
01:53:38,689 --> 01:53:44,391
[SPEAKER_24]: But I like to do it, I mix it with my Indian green soda so it looks like this cool blue-green stuff and it tastes really sweet, but...

1519
01:53:44,989 --> 01:53:49,673
[SPEAKER_24]: The ultra-saccharine nature of Pepsi Blue is a bit cut down a bit, and it tastes a whole lot better.

1520
01:53:49,853 --> 01:53:51,674
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the people who are addicted to Ghetto Kool-Aid?

1521
01:53:51,694 --> 01:53:52,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think they'll have a problem with it?

1522
01:53:53,035 --> 01:53:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1523
01:53:53,856 --> 01:53:55,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it does kind of taste like Ghetto Kool-Aid.

1524
01:53:57,158 --> 01:53:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Pepsi Blue's kind of carbonated Ghetto Kool-Aid.

1525
01:53:59,981 --> 01:54:04,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I will say, though, out of all the new drinks out on the market, the winner is Vanilla Coke.

1526
01:54:04,364 --> 01:54:04,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla Coke.

1527
01:54:05,545 --> 01:54:08,307
[SPEAKER_24]: I utterly disagree, but that's because I've just never liked vanilla in Coke.

1528
01:54:08,327 --> 01:54:10,889
[SPEAKER_24]: And you're just an ass, so... Just kidding.

1529
01:54:11,329 --> 01:54:12,030
[SPEAKER_24]: We love Todd.

1530
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:12,850
[SPEAKER_07]: He is one big butt.

1531
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:15,433
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't believe that SoCalKick hasn't heard of Pepsi Crystal.

1532
01:54:15,893 --> 01:54:18,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Where the hell have you been for the past ten years, bro?

1533
01:54:18,335 --> 01:54:20,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Crystal Pepsi was on it.

1534
01:54:20,256 --> 01:54:21,577
[SPEAKER_04]: When was Crystal Pepsi's out?

1535
01:54:21,918 --> 01:54:22,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1536
01:54:24,059 --> 01:54:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably not going to use it, but I'm making a banner with a Crystal Pepsi can on it.

1537
01:54:28,623 --> 01:54:33,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Crystal Pepsi era of growth was from something like 1993 up until about 1995 before it died.

1538
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:37,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a follow-up comment.

1539
01:54:38,081 --> 01:54:39,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, are you dissing Clorox wipes?

1540
01:54:40,001 --> 01:54:41,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you even tried sucking on them?

1541
01:54:41,722 --> 01:54:43,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, creamy Clorox goodness.

1542
01:54:43,922 --> 01:54:48,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard Clorox described as creamy.

1543
01:54:49,004 --> 01:54:51,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Your poo will smell lemon fresh.

1544
01:54:51,685 --> 01:54:54,445
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we are not having any mint scattles reference.

1545
01:54:54,626 --> 01:54:56,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we have, like, lemon scattles.

1546
01:54:58,547 --> 01:55:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel the mint taste as rainbow.

1547
01:55:00,187 --> 01:55:03,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, Coke, too, on the other hand, was the biggest pile of ass ever.

1548
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:04,148
[SPEAKER_24]: They still sell that in Britain.

1549
01:55:04,168 --> 01:55:06,009
[SPEAKER_04]: New Coke is huge in Britain.

1550
01:55:07,572 --> 01:55:11,254
[SPEAKER_24]: But then again, in Britain, you can also go into Burger King and buy a bean burger, okay?

1551
01:55:11,334 --> 01:55:13,875
[SPEAKER_24]: So, they have no fucking taste.

1552
01:55:13,895 --> 01:55:15,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Wasn't that just a tofu burger?

1553
01:55:16,036 --> 01:55:16,916
[SPEAKER_24]: No, this is a burger.

1554
01:55:16,956 --> 01:55:23,219
[SPEAKER_24]: It's got, like, you take fucking Taco Bell beans or something, and you lump it in between two buns with cheese and lettuce and all that shit.

1555
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:24,480
[SPEAKER_24]: It's called a bean burger.

1556
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:25,640
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a vegetarian thing.

1557
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,461
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, being the token vegetarian, I went and had one at the airport.

1558
01:55:28,902 --> 01:55:32,443
[SPEAKER_24]: And, oh my god, I was crying for a goddamn tofu burger.

1559
01:55:32,683 --> 01:55:33,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And I hate tofu.

1560
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so crazy.

1561
01:55:37,269 --> 01:55:38,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Who will they think of next?

1562
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Marshall Beat!

1563
01:55:58,234 --> 01:56:08,723
[SPEAKER_24]: We know that Frequency is online, but we also know that VibRibbon's sequel, Mojibribbon's online, which is really cool in that you take text files, run it through, and the little rabbit turns it into a custom-made rap.

1564
01:56:09,023 --> 01:56:17,690
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like we used to do with our old voice reader things back in the old days of Windows 3.1 and shit, where you'd have the weird, funky voice read your little text messages.

1565
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:19,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the computer.

1566
01:56:19,999 --> 01:56:21,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say, Fook.

1567
01:56:23,022 --> 01:56:26,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Fook you.

1568
01:56:27,186 --> 01:56:31,671
[SPEAKER_07]: You look like shite.

1569
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:35,234
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the DOS program that was, this is my favorite one.

1570
01:56:35,414 --> 01:56:39,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, I think in 8th grade, the psychologist.

1571
01:56:42,088 --> 01:56:42,949
[SPEAKER_04]: and Dr. Sabato.

1572
01:57:05,023 --> 01:57:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1573
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:27,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if any of you ever saw that, but I do have a memory of that.

1574
01:57:27,891 --> 01:57:29,331
[SPEAKER_04]: The Crystal Gravy was so funny.

1575
01:57:29,851 --> 01:57:31,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I guess you had to be there.

1576
01:57:31,731 --> 01:57:38,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that was back in the high period of Saturday Night Live, 93 to 94.

1577
01:57:39,893 --> 01:57:41,873
[SPEAKER_24]: Back when I was like 12 or something.

1578
01:57:42,353 --> 01:57:45,854
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, I drank a gallon of Crystal Pepsi a day during school years, I think.

1579
01:57:46,414 --> 01:57:48,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I started my senior year of high school in 93.

1580
01:57:49,554 --> 01:57:50,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make me feel bad.

1581
01:57:50,434 --> 01:57:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about online games and all that stuff next week.

1582
01:57:53,315 --> 01:57:53,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.

1583
01:57:54,615 --> 01:57:56,316
[SPEAKER_24]: 93?

1584
01:57:54,995 --> 01:57:56,316
[SPEAKER_24]: I was in freaking 7th grade.

1585
01:57:56,356 --> 01:57:57,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I graduated in 94.

1586
01:57:57,916 --> 01:58:00,437
[SPEAKER_24]: No, 6th or 7th grade is when I got into 93.

1587
01:58:01,297 --> 01:58:02,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn, you're old.

1588
01:58:02,878 --> 01:58:03,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my ass.

1589
01:58:05,799 --> 01:58:07,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, I think we're going to end the show.

1590
01:58:08,339 --> 01:58:10,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final notes other than fuck Tal?

1591
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:10,540
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1592
01:58:12,201 --> 01:58:14,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but fuck you next week.

1593
01:58:14,041 --> 01:58:15,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my music?

1594
01:58:16,642 --> 01:58:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hold on.

1595
01:58:18,363 --> 01:58:19,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to find your music.

1596
01:58:19,543 --> 01:58:21,824
[SPEAKER_04]: We played a lot of music tonight in the middle of the show.

1597
01:58:21,844 --> 01:58:22,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to find your music.

1598
01:58:23,968 --> 01:58:24,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, I got it.

1599
01:58:25,649 --> 01:58:29,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you, thank you, and fuck you.

1600
01:58:31,452 --> 01:58:32,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Well put, thank you.

1601
01:58:32,913 --> 01:58:34,154
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're ending the show now.

1602
01:58:34,494 --> 01:58:37,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts from the lovely Miss DarkSakura?

1603
01:58:39,637 --> 01:58:40,538
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a mic whore.

1604
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:41,558
[SPEAKER_04]: You are.

1605
01:58:41,778 --> 01:58:42,759
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, you are.

1606
01:58:43,099 --> 01:58:44,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you'd like to say, Matt?

1607
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:45,340
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1608
01:58:45,721 --> 01:58:46,421
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Bradley?

1609
01:58:48,712 --> 01:58:49,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, it is.

1610
01:58:49,854 --> 01:58:53,341
[SPEAKER_04]: On behalf of everybody here in the studio tonight, goodnight.

1611
01:58:55,525 --> 01:58:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1612
01:58:57,620 --> 01:59:03,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to our Bomani Music and More program because we want to whore up our ratings and that's the best way to do it is when we have listeners.

1613
01:59:03,582 --> 01:59:04,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So listen to us all the time.

1614
01:59:04,822 --> 01:59:08,023
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're sleeping, just leave it on and let the music fill your dreams.

1615
01:59:08,403 --> 01:59:09,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, I feel sorry.

1616
01:59:10,504 --> 01:59:14,125
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be dreaming about everything from... Let Orange Lounge violate you.

1617
01:59:14,365 --> 01:59:20,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancing Pompokolin to Pachinko Love and Fear Factory is there.

1618
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:23,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the end.

1619
01:59:23,883 --> 01:59:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodnight.

1620
01:59:24,965 --> 01:59:26,808
[SPEAKER_24]: And next week we'll have our Kutimu impression.

1621
01:59:26,829 --> 01:59:27,690
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let go of it!

1622
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:28,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up, Shiva.

1623
01:59:28,292 --> 01:59:29,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Microphone whore.

1624
01:59:29,093 --> 01:59:29,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1625
01:59:30,367 --> 01:59:33,328
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1626
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:37,028

[SPEAKER_12]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1629
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:58,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, son, a funny thing about regret is that it's better to regret something you have done than to regret something you haven't done.

1630
01:59:58,852 --> 02:00:11,364
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, if you see your mom this weekend, be sure and tell her... Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
