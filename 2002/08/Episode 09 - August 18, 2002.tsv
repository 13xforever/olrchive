51647	52367	212, fuck you!
52387	53868	You have no morals, darling.
53968	58310	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching kiss of purpose.
59050	60631	Kiss my great news.
61411	63753	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.

68295	69215	I'm working on it.
69956	70376	Loser.
70536	71056	Lame!
72057	72997	I'm the side of my face.
73971	82815	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth...
96642	98484	Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
98864	103509	You're tuned in to the Bimani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things B-E-Mani.
103930	106052	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
106532	110617	I have to say B-E-Mani because I get criticized when I don't say B-E-Mani like the announcer did.
110637	111357	B-E-Mani.
111397	111858	Whatever.
113079	115622	But I'll get criticized if I don't say B-E-Mani.
115762	116563	But poopy on that.
116583	117384	Poopy, poopy, poopy.
118974	122339	As I said, joining me as always, the lovely Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
122359	123181	You didn't say that.
123201	123601	You just said it.
123621	124302	Well, I'm saying it.
124363	126145	I said it the past eight weeks in a row.
128220	129281	How are you doing today, Jamie?
129681	130421	I'm fucking tired.
130821	131522	I can imagine.
131562	132762	We'll hear why very soon.
133182	136484	This is episode number 9 for August 18th of 2002.
136944	143107	And I know we've probably got a lot of new listeners tonight tuning in for the coverage of the Dollar Mendy Tournament.
143688	147930	And I'm pleased to announce we do have all the interviews ready to broadcast for you all tonight.

188394	189975	You get a gold star for attendance.
190235	191475	I was going to get the sticker page.
191996	195717	We'll be talking to everybody else a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
196277	202220	And in that break, we're going to have an original version of a famous DDR song, which I'm sure you're all going to enjoy.
202500	205861	Come join our chat room on any other side IRC server.
206795	209659	Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.
209739	210500	No Britney.
211462	212543	But we could get Petite Love.
243355	248682	I'm just a little bit of an adult, but I want you to notice me.
248702	250524	My beloved mama, my darling.
250604	254068	I'm just a little bit of an adult, but I want you to notice me.

483214	484637	Thank you for watching!
598587	599372	Thanks for watching!
671107	676950	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
681773	685455	That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
686642	688302	Real Radio makes Jamie cry, too.
689943	694064	The chatroom demanded more promos last week, so we got some together for this week.
694104	694744	Just a few, though.
694764	698465	We did a special one, just because you guys bitched.
700165	703926	So, anyway, and now they're bitching in chatroom.
703946	707167	We're just going to have to make a new one for them, because they're not capable, apparently.
707867	708587	Chocotola Chocotola Chocotola
736098	737760	You're listening to KTMI Radio.
737800	738220	No, I'm kidding.
738280	738801	I was kidding.
738821	741424	If you really believe that, honestly, you think DDR is that great?
741444	743145	Rob has to let himself go.
743386	744006	Flotation.
746778	747959	I was a microphone whore
770362	770943	DJ Trunks Owned You Board
791594	795939	When did Captain Jack do a remix to Take Me Out to the Ball Game?
810629	817511	From what I remember, there's a Dance Mania Sports album that's out now, and that's when the song's on.
817671	822592	At least we didn't get the Baja Man with Who Let the Dogs Out, which was also on that CD.
823792	826233	That song would have been cool for DDR.
826733	828433	You are in the minority, sir.
829473	836215	What I'm disappointed is, 9-1-1, I love their Friday Night song, but more than a woman, Friday Night rocks it.
837428	843210	One interesting entry I see here, Eiffel 65 with Blue is on this list.
843731	847032	That's one that should have been in DDR maybe three years ago.
847052	848152	Go ahead and read off the list.
848333	849893	Okay, I'm going to read off what I can here.
849913	856736	We got Never End by Yoma Komowatsu, Midnight Town by the Divas, Secret Rendezvous, Baby Give Me Love, those songs.
857376	861558	Red the Fire by Scotty D, who I don't think has done anything since Drop the Bomb, correct?
861578	861618	No.
861858	863999	No, he did something on 2DX.
864899	866620	He did the track with Megu, Stick Around.
868420	870561	Celtic Music, Revenge vs. Desire.
871221	873742	That's going to be very cool, as long as it doesn't sound like Enya.
873802	877383	Because Enya facilitates foul movement.
877903	879304	As we've said on other shows.
880764	884946	B4U, of course, returns, hooray, with a song called Crazy Sound.
885866	886987	Max the XXXium Love to...
908980	911261	That's the one song that was in Euromix too.
911281	912202	I don't remember what it's called.
912242	912942	Love Something.
913502	915523	Okay, cool.
915543	916063	321 Stars.
917144	918164	Finally in DDR.
918204	918425	What?
918485	921986	If this list is true, we got the 321 Stars in there.
922006	922747	That would so work.
924447	933532	Colors, Glorious Days, A, L'Amour et Libre, Kiss Kiss Kiss, and Mobomoga.
935312	936393	You could just say Love and Liberty.
938133	963145	Lavo and La Libert√©, Extreme, Masa Kenada, and then a bunch of other songs here, Bus Stop, Owner of a Lonely Heart, Venus, Sunshine in Our Music, New York City Boy, What's Up 2000 by DJ Miko, New York City Boy by Pet Shop Boys, not the 2DX4th version, that's the original, and then Nancy and the Boys with SOS, I wonder if that's the same Dr. Bombay SOS, or if we're talking like ABBA SOS, or what?
963165	964646	If it's ABBA SOS, that would be cool.
966232	969353	DJ Chaos with Sweet Desire and DJ Magical with Rush Hour
987955	988556	by Sigma.
988816	989156	I don't know.
989216	990737	Okay, well, Max Infinity sounds better.
990797	993800	Max XXM is really retarded.
994000	994260	Yeah.
995321	996682	It's like Porno Max.
996742	997923	It rides the short bus.
998523	1001826	It's the promo for the new movie with Vin Diesel or something.
1002646	1003167	God, no.
1005191	1006031	Possible Max 3 Song List
1024461	1029983	in Max 3, and I've got one of those songs that was just sent to me, and I haven't even pulled this up myself to listen to it.
1030323	1034304	I'm told the quality isn't the best, but we'll play a little bit of it for you here.
1034744	1036565	If it's pretty good quality, we'll even play the whole thing.
1036585	1038505	If it's kind of crappy quality, we won't play very much.
1038846	1039506	But let's listen to it.
1039546	1042987	This is Naoki featuring Politary with Memories.
1043847	1044627	Oh, God.
1045868	1047928	Are you ready?
1047948	1048228	Here we go!
1048308	1049289	I'm keeping the mics on for this.
1049309	1051109	No fucking Politary, please.
1052030	1053130	Okay, so far I'm digging it.
1054469	1059571	Wow, it's Destiny all over again.
1059591	1061711	Why can't that woman hold a key?
1077316	1080518	I have to, her voice is pretty good in this, so it's not as annoying as mine.
1080638	1082118	I think they've read it through a mixer.
1082238	1083519	I had to let you go.
1083679	1084820	I just want you to know.
1084860	1086800	Can you hear the change?
1086921	1087461	The one I love.
1087481	1088081	The one I love.
1106507	1109971	Super Performance!
1110152	1111473	That's a new one for your music.
1111493	1112514	Super Performance!
1113695	1115197	You all take that back!
1115758	1117099	You are making that back!
1117159	1118100	We have to stop you!
1118120	1118661	We could!
1130663	1133106	I just want you to know I just want you to be mine
1149750	1155813	It's Naoki Just like any other Naoki song is what I was saying Yeah, it doesn't sound that bad compared to half the other stuff
1175325	1176225	Super Performa!
1206115	1209197	Alright, let's get to the first part of those interviews, shall we?
1209497	1212298	Let's hear some of the interviews from DollarMendy's tournament.
1212318	1213939	Well, let's talk about it, because some of you guys went.
1214079	1217601	I, unfortunately, I really wanted to go to this tournament, but I did have some... Somebody went to QZAR.
1217861	1220063	I had some previous commitments that I had to do.
1220083	1221103	Somebody went to QZAR.
1221123	1221904	So I didn't get to go.
1222004	1222504	Well, let's hear it.
1222564	1222984	Excuse me.
1223525	1224025	Yeah, I know.
1224245	1229268	Loki had to go run off to QZAR with Paul over his stupid... He's like, oh, PA is boring.
1229288	1230148	We were loyal.
1230208	1231329	We raped the crane machine.
1231549	1232810	Yeah, me and...
1235174	1237796	DarkSakura, sorry, I forgot your name for a second.
1238316	1238837	No!
1238957	1239397	Get out!
1239597	1240057	I'm old!
1240258	1240618	I'm old.
1241618	1243119	Yes, in my own special way.
1243540	1247322	No, I won like 15 prizes off that game, and I don't know how many she won.
1247402	1248103	A bunch.
1248603	1249964	I was giving them away all day.
1250364	1260031	But PA got kind of boring because since it was on doubles, everything went twice as slow, and giving everyone a qualifying practice round made it
1260663	1264307	Even longer and more boring, but I made it through the qualifying round.
1264387	1268632	It got pretty intense once they started running through those homemade Oni courses, though.
1269313	1270274	That was pretty insane.
1270954	1273818	Meanwhile, Akuzar... No!
1273978	1274779	No Akuzar!
1276832	1279993	It was fun, but when I came back, the freestyle was cool.
1280993	1287034	I have to say, though, my favorite part of the tournament had to have been Ruben's little intermission stuff in between performers.
1287054	1287774	That was great.
1288115	1299957	Yeah, after like 20 people did Spin the Disc, he did a Spin the Disc freestyle with his stop, drop, and roll move halfway through the song, which was one of the highlights along with Corey's headspin.
1300137	1302060	Corey's Headspin was the winner of the show.
1302201	1302741	That was awesome.
1302761	1308210	You know, there were some really good routines, but I think I can get into... One of the judges gave him 100 and wrote, Oh my God, Headspin.
1308912	1309633	And that was their card.
1310299	1313783	I gave Ruben a negative 69 for his routine.
1315565	1316245	That's pretty cool.
1316445	1320389	But in PA, just throw out some who won stuff.
1321050	1323573	For PA, Jimmy came in first.
1324714	1326275	And I forget who came in second.
1326796	1329799	Emphasis, Jimmy came in first.
1330039	1331521	And Jazz came in third.
1332290	1332790	Nope.
1332810	1333711	Second was Radical.
1334711	1336632	I have the results right here.
1337212	1339913	If you'll give me a second to pull everything up.
1340093	1342194	Of course, this is taken from DDR Freak.
1342214	1348396	For PA, first place, we have Emphasis, who I also noticed, I guess, is newly inducted into RTF.
1349236	1350317	So, congratulations.
1351037	1352578	Second place, Radical of Ass.
1354118	1357479	Third from Step Squad, we have Jass, Maneki Neko Jass.
1357819	1358600	Fourth, Flush Chubbs.
1360901	1368825	For group freestyle, first place was Hypnotix and One Wish Mike, or Boogaloo Shrimp, I guess, going by now.
1368926	1373208	Second was DK Angel Wings of Step Squad and Kid Hero.
1373308	1378051	Third place was Marky Mark and Tommy L. I'm just reading off the list, I'm sorry.
1378651	1386756	For comedy, first place we have Mr. Wendell and Fancy Lala, who's his niece, that was a very, very cute routine to Cowgirl.
1387636	1390678	and we have a single freestyle.
1391278	1405105	First was Fuzzy Hat, second was Mr. Wendell, third was Rain of RTF and fourth was DK Angel Wing's dad who got up there and just did some amazing last minute freestyle.
1405145	1406485	That was the coolest thing ever.
1406505	1408426	That was probably the third coolest thing about the tournament.
1408446	1409527	He just got up and started like...
1410518	1413061	He was better than, like, almost everyone else.
1413101	1414102	And he made it up on the spot.
1414142	1414723	That was awesome.
1415083	1418107	But, you know, Fuzzy has the man because he had fire.
1418427	1420830	Yeah, he used candles for raving.
1421711	1425335	He did a really nice routine to healing vision.
1425875	1430260	And Wendell's was to center the heart, which I thought was very, very well presented.
1430380	1430941	Very funny.
1431817	1444658	of course I was a judge actually I was going to ask you Jamie as a judge for the tournament awesome, I'm glad you got to participate in that what did you think of the level of freestyle at this tournament compared to other tournaments you've either been to or heard about, seen videos of
1445365	1449228	I think that not everyone was really taking the tourney seriously.
1449468	1453611	However, it looked like people were having fun with what they were doing.
1455453	1457614	One of the biggest things that I like to judge on is energy.
1458215	1461037	The amount of enthusiasm you put into doing your performance.
1461737	1465360	And I have to say there was a good bit of energy in the performances.
1465740	1469383	That's what happens when everyone drinks like four pitchers of beer right before.
1469403	1479550	Yes, and we have the other contest that was going on on the side, and that's the drinking contest between Step Squad and the members of RTF that were there.
1479710	1479990	Yeah.
1480530	1488556	I know that Mr. Windle drank a lot because he fell over halfway through his group comedy performance for Cowgirl, and that was pretty funny.
1489536	1504225	We have the drinking results in 7th place, we have Iguana Grove Step Squad, 6th place, Islander, 5th place, Fuzzy Hat, 4th place, Mr. Wendell, 3rd, Reign of RTF, 2nd place, Kiyoki, and 1st place, Jay Connecticut Step Squad.
1505165	1505546	Pretty cool.
1505566	1512109	And I'd also like to give a shout out to the newer members of Step Squad and to my Step Squad family.
1513830	1517572	Really, it was Step Squad all over the place at the tourney and it was a lot of fun.
1519229	1521771	How many beers did Jay Kinetic have?
1521931	1524193	Because I know Rain had about nine.
1524694	1526835	All I have to say also is wait until we get to the interviews.
1527076	1531039	You're going to see just how Step Squad was all over this journey, especially in the interviews.
1534222	1539106	Also, well, I know that there were many, many pitchers of beer floating around.
1539946	1545211	I do also know that, you know, apparently I'm some alcohol connoisseur because I sniffed it and could tell it was Heineken.
1545231	1545891	But...
1548493	1550793	There was a whole lot of drinking going on.
1550833	1556614	I was worried for a few people, and Kiyoki turned into the human billboard for the tournament.
1557875	1568757	I think I signed his head somewhere, and Corey signed his arm with 2DX Style, which I'll go ahead and give a plug for 2DXStyle.net.
1569657	1570117	Check it out.
1570877	1571837	They have a plug for us, too.
1572217	1574458	Yes, very cool site.
1574638	1575598	It was basically...
1576727	1580229	There was the impromptu wrestling out in the parking lot.
1580889	1589933	We had Jay Kinetic putting Keshi in the walls of Jericho while I had to do a run-in with the orange bat of justice, trademark.
1591474	1595596	The bat did get signed by just about everybody, so it's now owned.
1597515	1598895	Okay, let's go to the tape.
1598915	1599555	How's that sound?
1600095	1600636	Sounds like winter.
1600656	1604976	Alright, I'm going to leave the mics hot and we can pause these interviews as we feel the need to interject.
1605596	1606477	Sam, this is a hot mic.
1606517	1607197	Put my hands up.
1607577	1608917	Alright, here we go.
1608997	1613838	This is Jamie live at the Dollar Mendy Tournament, which was held just yesterday on August 17th.
1613898	1615098	Wait, Rob, it's not live.
1616158	1617159	No, it's not live.
1617199	1618439	Well, we're going to play it live, though.
1619019	1619379	Yeah.
1619419	1620159	It's Jamie live.
1620179	1621039	We're playing a live tape.
1621259	1622039	I recorded it live.
1622119	1623520	When she recorded it, she was live.
1624160	1624500	Here we go.
1624560	1624940	Here's the tape.
1625755	1629478	Hi, this is DarkSakura coming to you live from Mountain Mike's in Concord.
1629498	1630799	See, what'd I tell you?
1630819	1631660	She's coming to you live.
1633499	1633799	Bitch.
1634400	1637041	August 17th of 2002.
1637722	1643746	This is a series of interviews done here at the Dollar Mendy Summer Vacation Tournament for Orange Knowledge Radio.
1644446	1646027	And if you don't like it, too bad.
1646508	1649510	So now we are to our next segment of interviews for Orange Knowledge Radio.
1649550	1652212	Now that I don't have the pause button on the recorder.
1652312	1655334	So let's go to... I have to say it was Jamie's first time.
1656326	1659567	So, you know, there was bound to be a few mistakes, and one of them was the pause button.
1659587	1674254	I'm upset, though, because one of the interviews I did, I started off with Naoki Ichidoji, who apparently we had been trying to meet for the Sakura Matsuri in San Francisco for years and years in a row, and we finally met up at tourneys, so it was cool.
1674474	1675094	Oh, that's cool.
1675114	1676195	Good for you guys.
1676735	1677836	By the way, this is the very first.
1678076	1679617	We're going to do this more and more on Orange Lounge.
1679677	1682599	Go out throughout the Bomani community and tape things at events.
1682699	1684760	This is kind of the first in a series of those.
1685841	1687241	Jamie did an excellent job with this.
1687622	1688962	My applause to her.
1689303	1690043	Let's listen to the rest.
1690323	1694225	To our current guests, go ahead and tell everyone who you are.
1694446	1695126	Did you hear our mic?
1695346	1695866	Once again.
1697247	1698068	The Cockmaster.
1698888	1700249	Yes, the Cockmaster.
1702665	1705247	and go ahead and let everyone know what you're doing for Trinity again.
1706468	1710171	Staff and Gumby has two inches of hot dick for you.
1711452	1712973	Would you like to answer this?
1713854	1714955	There's something behind that.
1714975	1715495	No.
1715836	1716456	He said no.
1716696	1716997	Okay.
1717317	1717497	Yes.
1718298	1728165	For those of us who were hanging out in the party room, there was a TV feed from the main room with the machine and there was a sign held up that says two inches of hot dick for you.
1728846	1730207	So that's where that's from.
1731156	1733378	Is there a point to two inches of hot dick?
1733418	1735399	No, it was just a sign held up in front of the camera.
1736239	1737440	Okay, you crazy kids.
1737560	1738100	Swale!
1739421	1739782	Exactly.
1739822	1746766	So, um, I know I've asked the question again because I'm a dork and have the pause button on, but, um... It's okay, Jamie, we forgive you.
1746846	1747146	Bite me.
1747806	1748127	Shut up.
1749908	1757072	So, um, you know, once again, who's looking to be the top server for PA and what do you think's going to happen for Freestyle?
1757472	1758173	Me, Dave!
1758923	1760664	No, you suck a cock.
1761144	1765186	Anyway, yeah, Jimmy, Emphasis, I think he will do really well.
1765306	1766266	Hey, you're here.
1766506	1766967	Hola.
1768127	1769428	Yes, Hugo just came in.
1769548	1769908	Word.
1770768	1774310	Yeah, I think Emphasis will probably do really well for Perfect Attack.
1774570	1777911	And like I said before, you don't know what's going to happen for freestyle.
1778332	1780192	There should be a good amount of routines.
1782393	1783514	Yeah, DDR for God.
1784491	1787854	He's going to win DDR4God How was the DDR4God routine?
1788234	1799884	Dude, I didn't see him Oh, I don't know I don't think he played Oh Well, what a load of crap Do you think we're going to have any waste of time today?
1800985	1807531	The tournament's a waste of time itself And now you have it That's it
1808679	1813943	And here we have a very special interview guest for our Orange Lounge radio segment.
1813964	1815104	Go ahead and introduce yourself.
1815685	1822130	Hi, I am the oh-so-annoyed and loving wife iguana girl.
1823251	1824112	Well, we love you anyway.
1825273	1827414	Well, so what brings you here to tourney?
1827495	1830357	Are you competing or watching or just laughing at everyone?
1831238	1832339	Mostly just laughing at everyone.
1833159	1834861	Who do you think is going to come out for PA?
1836507	1842072	I'm thinking it's probably going to come down to Emphasis, probably Emphasis, Oki, and Virtue.
1843313	1844915	And what do you think is going to happen for Freestyle?
1845976	1847016	I really have no idea.
1847877	1855063	Somehow I think Wendell's going to come out of it as one of the top, just because Wendell has this insane ability to always come out ahead.
1856625	1859727	So overall, are you having a good time mentoring?
1861049	1863551	So far, I haven't had too much time to...
1865080	1865881	It was very yummy.
1865941	1867603	Salad bars for like $3.99 rock.
1867643	1867943	Alrighty.
1867963	1868724	Well, thank you very much.
1882495	1885097	I'm gonna have a drunken nerd night You seem to like that phallic symbol
1910018	1910478	Guess what?
1910618	1912199	I'm being a microphone whore again.
1913680	1918323	We have yet another person to interview, so go ahead and state your name for the audience.
1919744	1920484	And you're done chewing.
1921725	1923726	Kansu, otherwise known as Kyokyo Step Squad.
1924567	1924867	Hey!
1925747	1927468	And what are you here doing, attorney?
1928229	1936373	Actually, no, I wish I was, but me and Jay were both on the inactive list because of injuries or other reasons, so we're both SSA and security today.
1937054	1937374	Ah, cool.
1937967	1940628	So what do you think of Perfect Attack so far and who do you think will come ahead?
1943030	1944410	We're having language filters, right?
1946151	1949933	Our show is rated for adult content, so go ahead.
1950994	1952815	Don't mince words, tell us how you really feel.
1953335	1956077	I don't give a flying fuck till the freestyle starts.
1956557	1958058	And what do you think is going to happen for freestyle?
1958978	1962320	As long as there's no nasty guys stripping, I'm all for it.
1963647	1965048	We did have Gumby's boxers.
1965088	1967729	Like I said, I was unable to make the tournament and I apologize for that.
1967809	1970550	I did see ass later on that afternoon, although I don't remember who it was.
1970690	1971090	Oh my.
1971590	1973331	Yeah, there was a cop right across the room.
1973711	1974771	You didn't even know who it was?
1974831	1975851	I didn't see he was walking off.
1975871	1976732	Was it a dark room?
1976852	1977752	It was a nice butt though.
1979093	1980073	Well, well, well.
1980093	1982854	I really hope for that since I'm judging, oh my god.
1982874	1988016	You know, I personally think that everybody performing for Step Squad is just going to kick ass.
1988136	1989016	You know, that's me.
1989436	1990217	Well, hell yeah.
1990237	1991037	Step Squad will kick ass.
1992308	1995451	So, um, overall, you know, you having a good time?
1996352	1997333	Yes, yes I am.
1997873	2002197	If only Hugo and Meg could finally figure out how much of what they own of me, it'd be all nice.
2003558	2004459	So there's no scale yet?
2005080	2007502	Well, apparently Hugo owns my soul, Meg just owns my body.
2008643	2009244	That works for me.
2009444	2011085	It works perfectly fine with me that way.
2011746	2012927	Alright, well we'll leave it at that.
2012967	2013287	Thank you.
2013808	2014188	Thank you.
2015229	2017571	So this is the first Super Interview number one.
2018172	2018372	Yay.
2019276	2022760	and I am sitting here, go ahead and state your name for the lovely listeners.
2023280	2023620	Virtue?
2024501	2024821	Radical.
2025482	2025722	Cool.
2026583	2031708	And so, you're here... Does that mean like his first name is Virtue and his last name is Radical?
2031728	2032589	No, I interviewed Radical too.
2033069	2033609	Oh, okay.
2033870	2035071	Oh, you did them both at once?
2035411	2039034	Sort of, it was mostly Corey, but... Oh, okay.
2039075	2039295	Cool, cool.
2039315	2041136	I didn't hear Bradical, I heard Radical.
2041437	2042157	Like that was his last name.
2042177	2042878	Radical, Radical, Radical, Radical!
2042898	2044540	Like, the Radical Virtue!
2046149	2047429	The 80s are making a comeback, you know.
2048009	2049650	So what are you doing for the tourney today?
2050290	2051030	I'm doing PA.
2052150	2052550	Anything else?
2054411	2054751	PA.
2055771	2056051	Cool.
2056251	2056791	And how did you do?
2058211	2059072	Oki beat me by two.
2060772	2061492	But you qualified, right?
2062032	2062272	Yeah.
2062692	2063673	Cool.
2064373	2070674	So just give us a little bit of your Bimani history and what you might be well-known for, even though probably everybody already knows.
2071754	2074195	I started playing Bimani back in 99 with...
2076010	2077771	The good old Beatmania Complete Mix 1.
2077811	2080553	Yeah, it's very quick master up in this piece.
2082414	2083535	And then I played DDR.
2084036	2084516	It was lame.
2085416	2088419	Then I got bored with Beatmania and then I went back to DDR and I was like, wow, this is pretty cool.
2089599	2091361	And I took it like an ass for two years.
2092481	2094463	Took it like an ass, in the ass, however you want to put it.
2096484	2098485	And then here I am now.
2100307	2101427	Big name that I don't want to be.
2103889	2104970	Yeah, he's taken my place.
2106369	2107530	Care to comment on that?
2109171	2109591	About what?
2110252	2111333	About taking his place.
2112654	2113234	I feel honored.
2115055	2115376	Yay.
2116637	2120119	So, who do you think is going to come out ahead for freestyle today?
2120820	2121840	Come out ahead?
2124502	2127825	Call me stupid for saying this, probably one of the RTF peeps.
2127865	2130227	If Tran comes, he's pretty strong and everything.
2132528	2133229	Mel, maybe.
2134584	2134965	I don't know.
2134985	2136205	I'll see what RTF has in store.
2136826	2139167	If anyone from ASK comes, they got it in the pocket, too.
2139187	2140768	I don't know.
2140808	2142009	I might pull something out of my ass.
2142409	2143790	Make an ass of myself like I do all the time.
2145811	2147873	There's that comedy section, too.
2148673	2149273	Yeah, that's right.
2149454	2150234	I might pull out another.
2150254	2151555	I might pull out another.
2152015	2153456	Wow, Brad just got blammed.
2153476	2154216	That's pretty harsh.
2154917	2157939	Can somebody explain to me what a blam is?
2159420	2160320	Beats the heck out of me.
2161041	2161361	Okay.
2162734	2167096	I'm hearing some interesting noises coming from the side that I'm not going to comment on.
2168717	2172159	So, do you have any final words that you want to say for our listeners?
2173259	2179162	Um, I'm not that special, quit making me something special, I play a game, I pass the song, whoop-de-doo.
2180163	2180843	And there you have it.
2182064	2182844	Oh my god, I was first!
2182864	2186006	So, we have now yet another interview.
2186546	2190428	So, go ahead and state your name for our beautiful and talented listeners.
2191718	2193319	My name is Mr. Wendell.
2193339	2194341	I am part of the staff.
2194701	2196263	I don't think any yet.
2196403	2198606	It was outside guarding the people who had to be hid away for P.A.
2208713	2212694	That's the reason he could keep up that act the whole time, is because he had influence.
2212834	2217576	If he had been drinking a lot later, and he can really chug fast, I saw.
2217676	2219037	Wendell is the beer master.
2219097	2221818	Is he like that beer guy on the man show?
2222418	2226700	He's not quite like the fox, but he's pretty fast.
2227961	2230041	Alrighty then, let's hear what else Wendell has to say here.
2230982	2233523	For the Dallarmandy summer vacation...
2236095	2238819	That reminds me, did Dollar Mendy ever make an appearance?
2238839	2240240	Because he was supposedly in town.
2240461	2241242	No, he didn't.
2241422	2242163	What a bummer.
2242183	2244726	Are you just staffing the day and not competing, or are you competing?
2246289	2249453	I'm also competing.
2250641	2256945	and you're doing what's this?
2256965	2265771	I am doing single freestyle and comedy.
2268633	2272255	So what do you think is going to happen so far for Trader Day?
2272275	2277519	Who do you see coming ahead for Perfect Attack and who do you think is going to be your fierce competition for freestyle?
2278183	2283567	Well, there's a lot of really good double freestylers that, well, double PA-ers, I should say.
2284307	2289791	I mean, right now, I have in my jail this little twerp by the name of Emphasis.
2290311	2292493	You know, he kind of, like, beat me during the Royal Rumble.
2293273	2295495	And I had to, like, give him a pile driver, you know.
2296556	2298197	I have witnesses for that.
2298397	2300838	But he's a really good kid.
2301299	2302279	He can do doubles pretty good.
2302620	2307263	There's also another little kid by the name of Maneke Nekajavs.
2308092	2313895	He's kind of like tall, he's redhead, you know, looks like a monster, but he's like a teddy bear.
2318498	2323821	And we also have like that wacky little guy by the name of Okimoto.
2324141	2326723	Yeah, he, that boy, good.
2328166	2330868	And who do you think is going to be your competition in freestyle?
2331229	2334672	Well, there's a lot of really good competitors.
2335492	2342518	I see a lot of really good freestylers, but you have that Hypnotix dude.
2343219	2346081	He's got that Darren's Groove thing going.
2346621	2351085	I also see that Fuzzy guy, Fuzzy Torso.
2357220	2360182	or whatever he's got fuzzy on him.
2360342	2362123	I don't know, you know, that's not my thing.
2363483	2371388	We also have the crazy, wacky players, and yeah, they're going to be really, really good.
2371748	2379952	There's just so many right there that are really, really good, and I can't say that I have much competition for them, but I'll do my best.
2380573	2383014	I think you'll do a good job because that stuff's well-earned.
2384187	2389592	Well, we represent Step Squad as a good organization.
2390854	2391915	It's really all about family.
2392655	2399582	We do our best to promote peace in the community.
2401284	2408631	We go out there and promote the freestyle, make sure that nobody does them hand slaps, do them knee drops, bump their head on the floor like I used to do back in the day.
2409580	2417043	But, you know, we try to have fun and make it an entertaining scene when we do tournaments.
2417163	2418364	And just, hey, have fun.
2418444	2420025	So you're having a good time so far?
2420865	2424407	I'm having a very awesome, entertaining time right now.
2425147	2428708	Even though I'm kind of like running staff and running this little jail right here, you know.
2429009	2429949	I have my big old fan.
2430509	2431990	You know, guys try to escape.
2432230	2433010	I have the Wilson butt.
2433431	2434331	But, you know.
2435126	2436067	Ben What's Ben's online name?
2455186	2456367	I couldn't remember right now.
2456427	2457467	It sounded like Chubbs.
2457487	2457927	Was it Chubbs?
2457947	2458307	Did you remember?
2458327	2458728	Yeah, it was.
2458768	2459528	Okay, that's what I thought.
2459548	2461329	For a moment, my brain was like totally flipping.
2461449	2461889	That's what I thought.
2461909	2466071	But I heard this before the show and it was never made clear, so I thought we'd state that.
2466331	2467752	What are you doing here at the tournament today?
2468372	2475115	I'm competing in Perfect Attack and I'm part of the staff, moving machines, kicking people out and stuff.
2476355	2477796	Sounds like grueling work.
2478796	2479637	It's free pizza.
2480625	2482246	That's always a good reason.
2483126	2486107	So what do you foresee happening for Perfect Attack today?
2486147	2487408	Who do you think is going to come ahead?
2487488	2489129	I think Oki will sweep.
2493230	2494231	Oki's going to win first.
2494811	2495491	Corey's going to fail.
2496972	2497232	I see.
2498352	2501494	And what do you see happening for Freestyle Literature?
2502254	2506816	I haven't really looked over the list, but I'm pretty sure Fuzzy Hat will come up as some improv.
2508091	2514054	Uh... Hypnotics might win, and... Kyle Snyder will entertain us all.
2514514	2515595	But Kyle Snyder never showed.
2515615	2515895	Indeed.
2517035	2522978	Um, so just to go ahead and give everyone a little bit of history, you know, what's your history in the Demani scene?
2523598	2527140	Well, I've been playing at the Boardwalk three years ago, two and a half.
2528320	2532522	Uh... My first big tournament was March Madness, which was about six months ago.
2533182	2536964	Until then, I've been at every tournament, pretty much, since March Madness.
2537651	2538971	All right, well, thank you for the interview.
2539711	2540152	No problem.
2541732	2542812	More interviews, yay.
2543232	2543472	Yay.
2544413	2552454	I got another person to interview, so go ahead and for our listeners, state your name and your brief history in the Bimani community.
2552975	2553815	What's your favorite color?
2553835	2555415	My brief history in the Bimani community.
2556435	2557356	It's a community?
2559876	2560676	More like a commune.
2561136	2563257	Yeah, a communist party.
2564312	2564832	Let's see.
2565673	2566774	I'll tell you what it's more like.
2566834	2568255	You ever hear about Waco?
2568535	2569496	Big bread party.
2573839	2574259	Thank you.
2574299	2575019	Somebody got a bus.
2576260	2576781	Let's see.
2577321	2578942	I go by the name STI.
2581244	2582144	What, my brief history?
2583105	2593412	I'm one of the three original founders of Step Squad, which is me, Jay Kinetic, and Strider, Vegeta.
2594261	2594721	A.K.A.
2594761	2595161	Strizzy.
2597162	2597682	Let's see.
2599163	2607646	I've entered too many tournaments to count, and just now I've actually taken it seriously on freestyling.
2607726	2613089	So instead of just half-assing everything, I might as well do a routine.
2614569	2616890	Last time I got a routine, but I failed the song.
2617350	2619051	Oh well, giving another shot again.
2619271	2620272	So that's why I'm here.
2621032	2623693	What do you think of your competition for freestyle today?
2625633	2632198	The dudes from Ass is like really good, and I think there's like two other people that are doing the same song I am.
2634459	2638602	I've been practicing it today, but I've been moving alright.
2640564	2641845	I don't know, man.
2641905	2642665	Wendell's cool.
2643846	2649470	I don't consider him competition, so I don't care how high a place or whatever, and...
2651445	2653006	I don't even care about placing.
2653026	2656970	I'm just going to have fun, do what I'm supposed to do, and entertain people.
2658231	2661093	That sounds like a really good philosophy to have.
2661433	2668679	I've noticed that some people get really, really heavy on the competition, on the have-to-be-better aspect of me.
2668699	2670160	What do you think of that kind of attitude?
2671141	2673803	Yeah, it's like I had this mentality.
2673823	2678067	I was like, oh, man, I have to place top five, and I never end up doing it.
2678107	2679848	So it's just like, you know, forget it.
2679888	2680349	I'm just going to...
2681334	2687437	Do what I want to do, just dance and just entertain people, just show off some dance moves, whatever.
2688797	2689278	I don't know.
2689678	2691219	I'm just going to go do my thing.
2691239	2693159	I don't care if people don't like it or whatever.
2693179	2695761	As long as I have fun out there and I feel okay.
2695781	2697882	Do you have a final word for the listeners?
2699542	2700023	Yeah.
2702404	2702804	Word.
2705565	2705985	Indeed.
2706986	2707246	Thank you.
2707688	2711854	Alright, that's it for the first round of interviews there from Dollar Mindy's Summer Vacation.
2712435	2713436	And it was quite fun.
2713756	2713977	Yes.
2714437	2715519	What did you think of that?
2715599	2717141	Good group of people to interview there.
2717944	2719605	They were all very good about it.
2721126	2725248	Thank you all for putting up with me shoving a microphone up your nose or anything.
2725588	2729430	No complete drunks yet, but... Not yet, but we get them later.
2729630	2732471	But we do have more sets of interviews coming a little later in the show.
2732491	2735052	There's a great interview with Jahi in the second set of interviews.
2735252	2736033	Oh, that was fun.
2736513	2739795	And in the last set of interviews, you've got DarkSound.
2739815	2741676	You're interviewing him, the master of the tournament.
2742236	2746458	And the reason why the webcast on DDR Freak didn't end up happening...
2747038	2750619	So for those of you that were curious about what happened there, he gives the explanation.
2750679	2751099	It's all there.
2751119	2752559	We're going to play that for you a little later in the show.
2753119	2761141	In the meantime, if you weren't listening to the show a little bit earlier, we played for you Memories, the new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song.
2761421	2765042	And that was given to me from our chatroom comedian, Pyro Man.
2765622	2769203	And I promised him, since I played that, that I would play Destiny.
2769263	2770203	So I will play Destiny.
2770703	2776666	Right after Destiny, we've got two brand new 8th Style songs we're going to premiere for you right here.
2777247	2779448	Virtue from 2DX Style, big thank you to him.
2779568	2783750	Go ahead and visit 2DXStyle.net for all the latest and greatest 2DX news.
2785971	2786652	If you haven't already.
2787272	2791674	And we're going to hear some new stuff from 8th Style, thanks to those guys there.
2791754	2794396	So let's first hear Destiny and then we'll get to the 8th Style stuff.
2794696	2796577	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2813480	2814094	Thanks for watching!
2896297	2899338	Alright, as promised, here we go with some new 8th style tracks.
2899758	2904020	This first one is DJ Taka with M. And by the way, this is the first time I'll have even heard these.
2904420	2907642	Any of us in the room will have heard these live here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2907682	2910143	From 8th style, DJ Taka with M.
2971324	2972212	Thanks for watching!
3019195	3021316	from 8th Style here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3021336	3027779	That was DJ Taco with M. Big thanks to the folks at 2DXStyle.net and 2DXStyle.com.
3027919	3028639	They both work now.
3029340	3031240	And they've been yelling at me because I haven't been saying .com.
3031280	3032721	I guess that's how they're going to promote it now.
3032761	3034202	Although it was .net, but whatever.
3034922	3038864	Anyway, we were thinking, sounds a lot like V, doesn't it, that song?
3041246	3042967	That song is ass, okay?
3043107	3043867	That was crap.
3043927	3044888	What the hell is he doing?
3045208	3048470	I'm going to take a classical piano piece and add a beat to it.
3049050	3049490	Oh, gee.
3049790	3051911	Why don't you just throw Impolitary into there, too?
3051991	3052752	That would be even better.
3052892	3058895	That would make it sound... Chatroom is very... They're racking their brains trying to figure out what original piece that's based off of.
3058975	3060475	Bradley thinks he has it figured out.
3060495	3061116	Why don't you tell him?
3061456	3062396	It's from Moonlight.
3062416	3063417	It's another vibe rock.
3064139	3064779	DJ W with Gemini
3201181	3206626	That's DJW with Gemini, and we do believe the category for that will be elevator music.
3206746	3207767	God, that was awful.
3207867	3208427	I'm sorry.
3208447	3209508	No, that's mall music.
3209809	3210369	God.
3210469	3212451	Makes you want to take a nap or go shopping or something.
3212551	3213191	I didn't like it.
3213672	3215273	That's just my opinion here on Orange Lounge.
3215293	3216895	I preferred M much more to that.
3218116	3219197	I disagree with Loki.
3219357	3221038	I kind of dug M. It was cool.
3221078	3223460	I like that whole classical remake thing, but...
3224721	3226042	He does need to kind of reinvent it.
3226082	3226843	It's kind of been done.
3226883	3228784	We've had V, we've had A, Kakumei.
3229245	3231386	It's time, okay, M better be the last one.
3231426	3233188	It needs to go in a different direction from there.
3234389	3236750	Well, it's not that I don't like that genre of music.
3236790	3240393	I mean, Piano Ambient is awesome, but it's just he didn't do anything with it.
3240433	3241694	He just added a beat to it.
3241714	3247699	I mean, do a little bit more than just add a beat to the music, because it's really old.
3248419	3248780	That's all.
3248900	3249280	Quite old.
3250862	3256731	Well, I'm kind of wanting things to go back sort of old school, how the songs used to be in Beatmania.
3257171	3259555	I want 5-key style stuff, you know.
3261201	3261802	Thanks for watching!
3282446	3283307	I miss 5Key.
3283467	3284147	I miss it already.
3316801	3317582	Super Populence!
3317602	3318022	100 Combo!
3318042	3318622	Pretty good!
3346552	3362667	I don't wanna know what they say, no, no, I don't care They can't tell me nothing, I'm gonna go my way One, two, three, four, five, break the dollars, get out of here Come with me now, now we are going out
3382748	3389435	I know which way to go, just keep on going There is no time, no time to be wasted now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, now is the time to get out of here
3409778	3414581	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!
3414941	3415481	Holler!
3415661	3415741	P.S.
3415761	3416102	TTPO!
3425794	3430116	Our thoughts on the Mr. Brian and the Final Band with Crash from Euromix 2.
3430156	3431837	That song fucking sucked.
3432197	3434498	That was the biggest bit of ass except the guitar was cool.
3434718	3439921	Let's remove the Japanese singer and throw in a kindergartner who sounds like an old man singing crappy lyrics.
3440541	3441502	Breakdown.
3442202	3447605	Lyrics by Mrs. Kimball's kindergarten class sung by this stupid guy.
3447845	3448665	That's really what it is.
3448825	3449486	It's just crap.
3449526	3453508	Let's take a crappy song and add a crappy guy to it and we'll get some more crap.
3454583	3459288	Hey, why don't they just make another... I know, he could sing Firefly, too.
3459688	3461550	Or, I know, why not sing Dive?
3461811	3464894	I'm sure his voice would sound awesome on Dive.
3464954	3466696	Or True, you know, he'd be good for True.
3467497	3470720	According to the chatroom, it's white guys trying to do breakdown in English.
3471801	3473923	So anyway, wow, that was really bad.
3474023	3474163	So...
3476459	3493974	On behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, on behalf of the lovely DarkSakura co-host, on behalf of myself, Sky co-host, I would like to offer an apology for wasting one minute and 44 seconds of your life with that utter piece of crap song that is known as Mr. Ryan and the Final Band.
3494975	3497377	Will you please ever forgive us for that?
3497797	3498778	Send us money if you do.
3501833	3505136	Many can be sent to, you know, Jamie Summer's care.
3506017	3511243	Do I smell, yeah, DDR Max USA exclusive track.
3511303	3512725	Oh, no, wait, no, it wouldn't be exclusive track.
3512785	3515087	New original for DDR Max USA, though.
3515187	3516228	I can just see it right now.
3516268	3521674	It smells like the festering pile of shit that DDR Max USA will probably become.
3522655	3523656	Maybe not.
3523696	3524157	Maybe not.
3543171	3544853	I wanna do my fuck you of the week
3560526	3566089	Jamie likes to get all pissed off at something every week, and we call it Jamie's Fuck You of the Week segment.
3566209	3567070	I'm getting ornery!
3567350	3571872	She's not always the sweet, innocent moderator that you might think she is.
3571912	3573333	Bullshit, I'm sweet.
3574133	3578995	I try to be, but, you know, after keeping it pissed up inside, I have to let it out.
3580436	3583458	Okay, so, let's get to Jamie's F.U.
3583578	3583918	of the Week.
3585675	3594319	Okay, my fuck you of the week goes to, um, I forgot what my fuck you of the week was gonna be.
3594679	3599221	Oh yes, fucking Fantasy, in like seven of all things.
3599301	3611427	Okay, I've been, you know, Iguana Girl has been very nice to let me, you know, trade out my fifth style with her to play fourth style, so I've been, I said I'm gonna, you know, finally beat Fantasy and pass that back, because...
3613028	3622673	I haven't been playing 2DX that long, and I've always been slow with picking up some of the stuff for the running runs, although once I learn something, I really don't forget it.
3623734	3627096	So I've been struggling with fantasy, and I've been getting 72, 76, 78, 78, 78, 78...
3631398	3637479	Every damn time I play the song, so I want my fucking border bonus, and it's about goddamn time that I get it.
3637779	3638699	And then I can give it back.
3638819	3641100	Although, on a good note, I did finally pass a check or two.
3641940	3642520	Well, you go.
3643340	3651402	And I am probably about a couple weeks away from having my first seven-star beaten.
3652202	3652942	Yeah, you're very close.
3652982	3653662	I saw you play it today.
3653702	3654342	Voltage or Y31.
3654442	3657163	I have an F view of the week.
3658829	3670540	A big fuck you, this is going to be short and sweet, a big fuck you to Walgreens for not having any vanilla coke in stock today, and on top of that, not having any Pepsi Blue in stock today.
3671080	3673202	That stuff tastes like shit.
3673342	3676025	It's a good dessert drink for me, just let me have my fun.
3677418	3678098	It's good shit.
3678118	3682179	It tastes like someone ate a bunch of strawberries and cotton candy and puked it into a jar.
3682419	3688221	Well, regardless, Walgreens did not carry the puke in the jar that I happen to like, so a big fuck you to Walgreens.
3688941	3689981	Matt, you have a fuck you of the week.
3691181	3691821	Yes, I do.
3692422	3698063	My fuck you of the week... I had to give you a song, I'm sorry.
3698583	3699383	I hate this song.
3700163	3702424	My fuck you of the week goes to the Concord City Planners.
3703274	3705235	What the hell were you thinking with the streets?
3706135	3708997	Streets are supposed to have perpendicular intersections, okay?
3709197	3713899	This crap of winding streets that you have in there is just unnecessary.
3714339	3717741	I got lost about four times in Concord, and it should have been really simple.
3718341	3719842	Might I add that was on the same road.
3720851	3722552	Yeah, it was on the same damn roads.
3722752	3725133	I believe it was like Stratton or something like that.
3725533	3726973	It was just pathetic.
3727113	3732996	This road makes three different turns, and they have streets intersecting with it.
3733536	3734036	It's crap.
3734316	3735237	So, my F.U.
3735277	3735857	goes out to them.
3737117	3738158	It's raining crap.
3738538	3739258	Hallelujah.
3739438	3743420	Our chat room has some F.U.s of the week they want to dish out, so let me get to those.
3744142	3772263	SoCalKick says, F you JenimScream for not going to Power Station and F you DJ Ness for leaving early and fuck you PepsiBlue for making me sick and having a crappy cap that spilled on the cam I borrowed and it spilled on it and fucked the cam up, whatever that means PyroMan, our local chatroom comedian, would like to give a big fuck you to the Live365 lady that comes up whenever he tries to start the stream and it ends up delaying his stream by two minutes so, a big F you by them
3773943	3774864	And that's our Fuck You of the Week.
3775204	3778086	But my Love You of the Week goes toward Propel, put out by Gatorade.
3778647	3781889	This beautiful fitness water tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid and owns you for free.
3784311	3788494	Let's get to the second part of the Dallarmendy interview, shall we?
3789075	3789755	We shall.
3789996	3790476	We shall.
3790536	3791096	Here we go.
3791276	3795400	More of Jamie live doing interviews at the Dallarmendy tournament, which was just yesterday.
3796140	3796581	Yes, it was.
3796621	3797581	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3797842	3798142	All day.
3798242	3798382	All day.
3800889	3802029	I'm doing more interviews.
3802530	3809152	Anyway, go ahead and state for our listeners your name and a little bit of your history in the Bad Bunny community.
3811053	3817815	Yeah, I'm Hattori Hanzo, and I've been in the DDR community for about two years now.
3818735	3824277	I remember starting out when we had Sun Valley Mall out here in Concord on a USA mix machine.
3825120	3833005	and everybody's fan favorite Orochi would come and play all the time and would just scare everyone off the pad, which is okay.
3833225	3836506	We finally figured out how to play and we decided to go along with it.
3838227	3851295	I met people like Wendell and ShadowMeTwice and Draconis over at the mall and we became good friends once we got a machine over here in Mountain Mikes and from there it's just been...
3852156	3853497	So what's your plans for the tourney today?
3877276	3884060	Well, I'm judging freestyle today, because I don't play doubles, so perfect attack is pretty dumb for me right now.
3884920	3890784	And I really can't freestyle, so I decided to just be a judge, and that'll be it.
3892525	3895786	So, who do you think is going to come out on top for freestyle today?
3896867	3897347	Freestyle?
3897547	3899208	I don't know, there's some pretty good people out there.
3899228	3905392	I know there's Wendell, and you got Takumi coming up with something, and then we got...
3906304	3910207	Fuzzy, and you've already got some good names out there, so I can't really tell.
3911509	3915432	Well, overall, what's your opinion of the Beimani community as it is right now?
3916573	3928823	Well, lately it's becoming more and more, quote-unquote, scrubbified with all these newbies trying to act like they know what they're talking about without asking questions beforehand.
3929404	3934408	So, I know, I'm one of the, quote-unquote, old-school people here,
3935526	3947608	And respect is still there, but these newbies coming up, they need to either just sit there and watch what's going on or ask sensible questions because this immaturity is just not working.
3948829	3953330	So do you have any final thoughts or words that you want to leave with the listeners?
3955150	3957470	All I've got to say is, Step Squad for life.
3958611	3959011	Works.
3960411	3960551	Yep.
3962214	3966517	And I'm going to go ahead and add my personal note that I totally 100% agree because Test Squad owns.
3967778	3968038	Thank you.
3969499	3971480	And we have more interview fun.
3971560	3971920	Yay!
3971960	3976343	So go ahead and for our listeners, go ahead and state your name and your history with the Bimani community.
3977384	3978084	Let's see.
3978104	3982667	I'm ShadowMeTwice and I like playing DDR.
3983127	3987390	And I've been playing DDR for like two years.
3988050	3989171	And yeah...
3991400	3993020	That sounds absolutely awesome.
3993680	3996641	So what is your participation with the tournament today?
3996681	3999801	Are you competing or moral support or immoral support?
4000822	4004442	Well, I guess I'm just here for moral support, just hanging out.
4005322	4009943	And if Dark Sound lets me, I might do my little old school routine from back in the day.
4010003	4012184	Otherwise, I'm just going to stand and hang out.
4015064	4016684	That sounds pretty groovy.
4017184	4019605	So what do you think of the competition so far?
4019665	4020625	How do you think things are going?
4021667	4026410	Well, I don't know too much about PA, but it looks pretty good.
4026750	4034515	I know I see some pretty good people here, like Virtu, and I know Mononeko Jazz is here, so he's good stuff.
4036317	4039639	I'm waiting for that freestyle, though, and I'm wondering if the webcam is working.
4040960	4045983	I know, I'll have to check on the cam, but from the last I heard, I think that everything is supposed to be a go, so...
4046827	4051750	So do you have any final words for the Bimani community or for our listeners or anything?
4052871	4056954	Yes, keep on playing the DDR and the Bimani.
4058015	4058415	Thank you.
4060616	4066220	Hi, go ahead and state your name and involvement in the Bimani community for the listeners.
4068222	4069182	Can you repeat the question?
4070703	4074085	For our listeners, what is your name or your nickname and...
4075678	4077539	Your history with the Belmont community, so the listeners know.
4079180	4085344	My name is Emphasis, and basically I just go to Sunnyvale Golf Land every Saturday.
4086785	4089047	So what's your participation in the tournament today?
4089927	4095111	Well, I just got to the second round, and I was first in qualifying.
4095131	4096852	That's for Perfect Attack?
4097272	4097492	Yes.
4098073	4099474	Are you doing a freestyle at all?
4100134	4100394	No.
4101455	4104337	So who do you think is your strongest competition in Perfect Attack?
4105575	4109796	Basically, Oki, because his scores in doubles Oni are insane.
4110697	4111037	Okay.
4111697	4115378	So, what's your view of the Bimani community as it is today?
4116278	4117279	It's getting worse.
4118719	4119299	Like in what way?
4120239	4125741	More, it's just, too much, as you say, drama.
4126821	4128002	Drama sucks.
4128302	4130903	So, do you have any final words for the listeners?
4132003	4132103	Uh...
4133639	4135440	Freestyle takes creativity.
4135540	4137321	PA takes nothing.
4137922	4139203	That's why I PA.
4140443	4140804	Thank you.
4142124	4143886	What's with all this hate for PA today?
4146087	4146967	It's really boring.
4146987	4147548	It was long.
4147808	4149609	Yeah, very long, like six hours.
4150269	4152031	It's as exciting as golf is.
4154432	4157454	There will be a tournament one day with exciting PA, I guarantee it.
4157878	4164102	I'm telling you, when they start doing the trivia questions mixed in with PA and start beating people with bats, when they get questions wrong, that will be the day.
4164762	4170046	It is something I would like to do for the next PA if we do a tournament here in Sacramento, which, by the way, we are trying to plan.
4170326	4172407	We'll have details on that for you as soon as we get them.
4173108	4175069	Nice little distant plug there.
4175129	4176050	And now back to the interviews.
4176910	4179192	This is round 20 million for the interviews.
4180072	4184015	Go ahead and state your name and your history in the Baymani community for the listeners.
4184810	4185971	I'm Paulo Zambrano.
4186252	4192377	I go in the DDR community as Rock My Socks Off, and in the Poetry Slam community I'm known as the Freaky Funky Space Monkey.
4192818	4194279	Isn't that a flavor of Ben and Jerry's?
4195140	4196621	I have no idea, but this guy was cool.
4196821	4197722	Alright, he sounds pretty cool.
4197742	4204289	And I've been involved in the Binami scene for about two years, although I've been playing DDR for about a year and three months now.
4205870	4209914	So are you in here competing or moral support, immoral support, observing?
4210778	4217784	Actually, it's really funny you bring that up because I'm doing a documentary about DDR in the Bay Area NoCal scene.
4218365	4220627	And let's see, I didn't pre-register.
4221167	4223489	I don't have a tripod, but I have a camera.
4223969	4231076	And the only way that Ruben or DarkSound is going to let me get in the actual pit area where all the freestyle action is going to go down.
4231456	4234899	So I actually register under freestyle, I suppose.
4235539	4241641	So I'm probably just going to register under freestyle and own the waste of time bracket just for the hell of it.
4243101	4246202	And who do you think is going to be your number one competition in the waste of time bracket?
4248582	4249203	I don't know.
4250763	4251943	All I know is I'm going to own it.
4252103	4253684	Let's just put it that way.
4253704	4255204	How's that for an honest answer?
4255664	4258465	So what's your view on the Beimani community so far?
4258505	4260685	I mean, especially in regards to that documentary you're doing.
4261386	4262926	It's hard to say actually because...
4263633	4285989	It was really, from what I could observe in the SF scene, it was really going down, then it was going up, with the whole rise of Riptide Arcade as being hailed as the golf land of SF, but I would have to say there's a lot less, I'm not sure, from what I could tell, unity in the community for so right now, because there's a lot of, I don't know, disenchantment, I suppose, and a lot of noobs getting in the community.
4286009	4288491	I'm not saying that's a bad thing, because we were all noobs, but...
4289031	4294453	It's a lot of cocky noobs and a lot of cynicism from the old schoolers, so that's what my take on it.
4295634	4300996	Would you have any advice for new players or just for the listeners in general?
4301056	4301597	Any final words?
4302977	4305939	Advice-wise, let's put it this way.
4306719	4313462	I'm still a noob, although, I don't know, different standards, but just keep doing it, keep trying.
4314602	4316143	Can I swear, actually?
4316303	4317464	Fuck what everyone else has to say.
4318952	4319673	And last words, uh...
4335077	4337958	Yeah, my doc is going to be out later this year.
4338978	4339618	Come see it.
4339718	4342559	I'm going to sell it to PBS and become moderately famous.
4343319	4344939	And, yeah, thanks a lot.
4345019	4346619	I like how he says he's not going to be famous.
4346659	4348640	He's just going to be moderately famous.
4348940	4351140	Like, you know, like a local celebrity.
4352681	4358522	Moderately famous, like the woman, the British woman that insults everyone.
4359642	4360822	I forget what show it's called.
4361622	4362703	You are the weakest link.
4362743	4363063	Goodbye.
4363883	4364243	That one.
4365889	4368111	He'll be more famous than that for a DDR documentary.
4368812	4370814	It's moderately famous because I don't know her name.
4372795	4373396	And something.
4375578	4376939	Damn it, now it's going to kill me all day.
4376979	4377920	My point exactly.
4379001	4379321	Shit!
4379421	4380302	Alright, back to the interviews.
4381463	4381783	Thank you.
4383064	4384926	And now we have more witty words of wisdom.
4385706	4387128	I dance to heal the world.
4388542	4392604	I prefer the Marilyn Monroe painting myself, but hey, to each his own.
4392684	4394405	I'm doing yet another interview, so...
4417145	4423346	If you don't mind, go ahead and give us your name and association and history of the Baymada community and whatnot.
4423826	4426127	Hi, I'm Megumi, also known as Sweet Megumi.
4426627	4428307	I am part of Pet Squad for Step Squad.
4430368	4432468	And what's your history in DDR?
4432708	4435609	I play DDR and I go to tournaments and I work for tournaments and stuff.
4435629	4440490	I don't usually enter them, but I'm there just... I'm interrupting this to say I looked it up.
4440530	4441530	It's Ann Robinson.
4441790	4442191	Thank you.
4442731	4443331	Ann Robinson.
4443751	4444171	See you, everyone.
4445132	4446294	and Always Friendly.
4446755	4447997	Yes, the girl in the pink.
4448498	4448699	Yes.
4449239	4450862	So, what do you think of the tourney today?
4451604	4452325	It's pretty cool.
4452365	4458676	There's a lot of people that I haven't seen for quite a while and I like the way Ruben has this set up as like, you know, the green room type of thing, so...
4460261	4464565	Who do you think is going to come out on top for PA or for Freestyle?
4464985	4467106	Of course I'd say Oki because he's my favorite.
4467667	4470309	And Freestyle, I don't know who entered.
4471670	4473591	If AJ's here, he'll probably win it.
4473691	4474732	If not, I don't know.
4476393	4482758	Do you have any final words for the listeners or for the community or any sage words of wisdom from observation?
4485680	4486320	I don't know.
4486440	4488061	Just play DDR.
4489694	4490835	Indeed, how honest.
4492636	4493677	And by the way, Stas Kwarant.
4494217	4496218	Yes, we do.
4497599	4498940	Anyway, thank you.
4500321	4501101	No problem.
4503263	4506565	And the newest in line of interviews for Orange Lounge Radio.
4506685	4510107	Go ahead and tell everyone who you are and a little bit about your involvement in the community.
4510583	4516046	What's up, yo, this is Jay Kinetic representing the SSF Step Squad family as well as the Step Squad Assassins and Pet Squad.
4516366	4521108	I've been playing this game since some of you didn't even know 1.5 was back in MGL so I could be considered an OG.
4522429	4527091	Basically, Step Squad was formed in order to bring more of a family element to DDR.
4527151	4534655	We wanted to be the alternative to most of the DDR free communities out there that are biased against gender, race, sexual orientation, you name it.
4535415	4564530	and we have about 30-35 players right now who are dedicated to the game as well as getting each other through tough times and just being there for each other like family I guess I have to say one thing that I need to comment is that the squeal of daddy in the background was Draconis' daughter Lily who is famous for she's also known as Fuzzy Half and is also famous for the quote this DVR sucks so I just thought I'd mention that because you can hear alrighty you sure nobody was tied up at the tournament or anything like that
4565208	4567469	There was no bondage going on at the tournament that I saw.
4567549	4568049	What a shame.
4568789	4579353	So, as far as tourney goes, are you competing or working or, you know, how's your involvement with this tourney here?
4579893	4583314	Today I'm out in my SSA uniform, I'm providing security.
4583394	4588876	We haven't had too many rowdy people, so I'm sitting here enjoying the Heineken courtesy of my friends Wendell and Cy, what's up Thieves Guild.
4589845	4591966	But normally I do compete in tournaments.
4592006	4599869	I didn't have time to prepare a routine this time, but the next tournament I'm looking forward to is Scandia or the Disney's Rave Tournament, where I might pull an improv, I don't know, as well as PA.
4600970	4605612	So far for the PA or the freestylers in each category, who do you think is going to come out on top?
4606072	4611534	I'm hoping that Jazz comes out on top of the PA-ers in this particular tournament.
4611835	4612955	Freestyle is still unpredictable.
4612995	4615516	I'm still not sure who's entered, so I'm going to try to keep a close eye on that.
4615536	4617277	We're going to be hanging out here until about 9 o'clock.
4617657	4618638	But it's always a good crop.
4618658	4622219	We have some of the most skilled freestylers out here today.
4622259	4626842	We got Rain from RTF out here, Fuzzy Hat from Step Squad, just newly inaugurated.
4626862	4627362	He's here.
4628022	4628443	Wendell's here.
4628463	4629523	I'm not sure if he's competing.
4629563	4631404	It's going to be hot competition as normal.
4632124	4637027	So what's your view on the Bitmoney community currently and what type of advice would you give?
4638059	4642004	Um, okay, if you're just starting out, the main thing is, just go for yours.
4642065	4645108	Just do what you want to do, and do you.
4645509	4649394	Don't try to emulate what you see in the videos exactly, but get tips from it.
4650035	4650756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4668730	4678593	I feel that there are a lot of online communities such as DDRspot.com, DDRfreak.com, and the Step Squad message board, plug ourselves in there, that provide a quasi-decent environment.
4678633	4686175	I say Step Squad out of the three does, but then again we're kind of a gay community in that respect because we only let in people that we know are people that are part of the squad.
4686195	4689916	It doesn't mean you can't visit, but the reason why we keep it that way is because
4690974	4697740	It gives all the players involved the chance to grow rather than having to deal with the prejudice and stereotypes of the DDR community at large.
4699221	4701663	This doesn't mean that the community at large is a negative thing.
4702383	4709548	Jason Ko, alias J-Dog, you may know him from the DDR Freak Boys, has encouraged a very large, very skilled community.
4709828	4715913	It just means that with that exposure that you get from interacting with that larger community, you may encounter more prejudice and more stereotypes.
4716193	4722457	Because for every one intelligent person there is, there's at least another nine who are like, Oh, I'm AZN and I'm Lee because I can pass all nine counters.
4722637	4723258	That sort of thing.
4723898	4734722	So, I feel that the community is growing and I hope to see it progress a little bit more in the United States, even though Konami of America can kiss my ass because they screwed us, but at the same time I still think it's going to grow.
4735442	4736242	I didn't get screwed.
4736682	4737422	I didn't get screwed.
4739143	4740003	Why weren't we invited?
4740663	4744745	I still think people are going to be playing it in the States, and if not, hell, I'll go play Pump It Up, I don't care.
4745605	4748526	So, do you have any parting words for the listeners?
4749489	4766996	Shoutouts to RTF, Gary, Shintenshi, NoSkills, pretty much everybody in there, Rain, this is way too many heads of shoutouts, StepSquad, THC, TCL, Tag, the DJ Trunks message board, Orange Lounge, where he put me on this interview.
4767136	4768796	I'm on my third beer, I'm about to go get a fourth.
4769457	4772318	Jessica, Under Sedation Live, go to that website.
4772578	4774159	That show is funny as hell.
4774179	4774959	Thank you, thank you.
4775119	4776840	Travis, Ross...
4778735	4780719	Shouts to NorCal DDR, keep it live, man.
4780739	4781801	These other people getting lazy.
4781841	4783164	Tequila, shout out to him.
4783424	4786830	Shout out to nobody but Jen representing NY and the whole movement, basically.
4788273	4788614	Thank you.
4789312	4789812	It's what I do.
4789832	4790673	Thanks for having me on, Jamie.
4790913	4791233	Always.
4819352	4821233	and getting some random interviews around there.
4821353	4823075	So you never know.
4823215	4824195	Yeah, you better watch out.
4824415	4827397	I'm going to be running around the bay with a tape recorder and I'm coming after you.
4828318	4833321	Anyway, a big hello to all of our new listeners tonight listening in for our coverage of the Dollar Mendy Tournament.
4833521	4839325	If you want to join our chat room, just join Channel Orange Lounge on any other side IRC server.
4839345	4843768	That's the server that hosts all the big Bimani channels like DDR Free, 2DX Styles, all those big channels.
4844148	4846730	We're on there too under Channel Orange Lounge.
4848184	4850946	And I'm being given some results from SoCalKicks.
4850966	4854848	There was another tournament that happened over the weekend, and that was the Power Station 2 tournament.
4855388	4865814	And in PA, the first place winner was Trunks, second was Frost, third was LazyPinoy, and fourth was... How do I pronounce?
4865854	4866595	I don't want to mess it up.
4866895	4868156	You've seen this before, I haven't.
4869830	4871271	Senai Butterfly, is that how you say it?
4871371	4871651	Thank you.
4872132	4875695	Freestyle, first place, Kenny Wood with Santa doing doubles.
4876115	4879278	In second place with Hungry Asian, he doesn't remember the song.
4879458	4881739	Then Jenith with Remember You.
4882380	4885823	And then Senai Butterfly again with Let's Talk It Over.
4885883	4890787	And there's pictures at 2dxstyle.com slash sck.
4891207	4894189	And it was all held on a fifth mix machine.
4895070	4896111	Pretty good stuff.
4898070	4904394	So, also I should plug our Bomani Music and More program, which is always on this network when we're not here.
4904874	4908717	All the music from DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania series.
4909177	4910898	And there's other random stuff in there too.
4910938	4911879	Busta Groove, Parappa.
4911899	4912639	We are indeed random.
4912679	4914560	We'll play whatever the hell we feel like playing.
4914600	4917282	Bomani and More on a dialogue-friendly stream.
4917802	4920484	Yeah, I did Channel Orange Lounge on the other side of the RC.
4921285	4923606	And one other thing, the Monday night rebroadcast.
4923626	4929791	If you missed any part of this show, if you missed our first set of interviews, we had a lot of people in the first set of interviews, we do rebroadcast this show.
4929871	4932132	We'll be rebroadcasting these shows on Monday nights.
4932533	4938857	So tomorrow night on August 19th, tune in at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time for the rebroadcast of this show.
4939277	4940839	And actually, we'll be doing it twice.
4940859	4943561	We're going to rebroadcast it at 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock.
4944915	4946776	Because you're special enough to have it twice.
4973426	4974566	Oh, one other thing, the email.
4974926	4981668	Any songs you want to hear, any comments on the show, marriage proposals for myself or Jamie, send them along.
4982088	4983149	We'll just refuse them though, sorry.
4983409	4986350	Go ahead and send us some hate mail too because we need some comedy.
4986410	4988470	We did get some hate mail a couple weeks ago.
4988510	4989530	That was fun.
4990131	4994092	That guy was like, I'm not going to say anything because I'm nice and he was retarded.
4994192	4998673	Send all your love and hate mail to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
4998693	5000133	That's all one word, orangeloungeradio.
5000973	5002794	You want to intro this next song for us, Jamie?
5003419	5005341	This is the one you were searching around for.
5005361	5006422	Let's just make it a surprise.
5006663	5007664	Let's just make it a surprise.
5007884	5009826	It's not the full version, but it's close enough.
5009886	5014071	We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back... More interviews!
5014111	5014752	Listless.
5015092	5016454	We'll do the interviews at the end of the show.
5016474	5017134	We're going to do listless.
5017154	5019237	We're going to do a really quick listless segment with...
5020054	5022557	Best DDR Background Best 2DX Song
5036974	5037875	was Absolute.
5038075	5038595	Absolute.
5038736	5042739	Best 2DX video was Love is Dreaminess.
5043139	5049645	And the worst Bomani song in history, next to Let Them Move, because Let Them Move is already assumed the worst Bomani song in history.
5049805	5050886	Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
5050906	5053008	Bye Bye Baby Balloon was determined.
5053028	5055069	So that song will no longer ever be on our playlist.
5055089	5056991	That song is banned from our playlist.
5057031	5057511	We will never play it.
5057531	5063656	I'd like to add the future song that should be added to that list, and that would have to be Crash.
5064097	5065258	That song is ass, and
5065798	5067581	I just hope it doesn't get worse than that.
5068543	5073631	The name, contrary to popular belief, is not after, you know, an accident, although the song itself is an accident.
5073671	5074453	I'm sorry, what'd you say, Matt?
5078710	5080471	God, this is awful.
5080571	5082153	Breakdown, then Crash.
5082633	5083454	What's the next one?
5084154	5084615	Stall?
5085275	5085996	Alright, I promise.
5086696	5090159	Basically, the name is a combination of crap and ass.
5090579	5090899	Crash.
5091360	5096524	When we come back, Listless, and you have to be, if you want to participate, this is an audience participation segment.
5096804	5101888	You have to be in our chatroom, Channel Pound, Orange Lounge, on any other side IRC network.
5102088	5103449	Chatroom gets to participate in Listless.
5103889	5106191	Best DDR background when we come back from this quick break.
5112096	5112796	Thanks for watching!
5176147	5177488	Thanks for watching!
5228766	5229428	Run for your life!
5229488	5230490	Run for your life!
5334975	5336038	Thanks for watching!
5605604	5606834	DJ Ranma S
5646330	5646973	Don't break my heart
5698904	5699865	Thank you for watching!
5768713	5770295	Thank you for watching!
5791729	5796351	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
5822848	5824188	Do we care what people think of us?
5824848	5826689	No!
5826709	5828149	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
5828609	5831530	Yes!
5832690	5834551	Extreme Bomani Radio.
5834771	5837492	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
5838314	5841135	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5841655	5846236	Tonight we've been doing some of the Dollar Mendy coverage from that big tournament in Concord yesterday.
5846256	5849516	We're taking a break to do Listless, one of our favorite segments here on the show.
5849916	5856318	We're going to be talking about tonight the best DDR background, that little image that comes up when you start the song.
5856658	5861819	It's an artsy moment for DDR, kind of showing off the graphics capability, or whatever you want to call it, I don't know.
5862880	5867145	We were kind of debating, there was a lot of debate in house about whether we were counting the videos or not.
5867446	5872412	And we decided, no, we're not going to count the videos, we're just going to talk about the actual backgrounds themselves.
5872492	5875536	Maybe we'll do DDR videos at a later date.
5876077	5878540	Now what's going to happen, you guys in the chat room...
5879884	5881345	are going to be able to vote.
5881725	5893149	We will give each our top three, and then we're going to go through an elimination round, where once we have that big list of 12 songs, there's four of us participating, we each get to take one off of the list.
5893789	5896050	And then those of you in the chat room will get to vote.
5896150	5900891	You're going to send me a private message in the chat room with your vote, and that'll be the winner.
5901592	5903392	And then we'll get back to the last...
5906092	5906752	All right, paranoia it is.
5906772	5907413	Matt, let's hear yours.
5931946	5939393	Okay, mine has to go for In the Mood for Dancing, because you've got that chick leaning over, and it's got the cleavage shot there.
5939593	5940253	So, that's it.
5941054	5941795	Alright, fair enough.
5942495	5943817	Dave, let's hear your number three choice.
5944357	5948881	Mine is Abyss, because it's got the two yellow aliens, or whatever they are, in the blue background.
5949161	5950422	Good choice, Abyss.
5950823	5954506	My number three choice is Conga Feelin', because I like that chick.
5954546	5955647	It's very abstract art.
5955727	5957629	She's got, what the hell is that coming out of her mouth?
5957669	5958970	I like that Conga Feelin' background.
5960811	5961712	Okay, so number two.
5961732	5963714	Alright, let's hear the number two choices.
5964154	5965756	Brilliant to you for the mecha thingy.
5967878	5969459	Brilliant to you for the mecha dog.
5969920	5971381	You're being very old school tonight.
5973563	5974364	What do you mean tonight?
5974384	5975165	I'm old school every night.
5975205	5975946	That's true, very true.
5977037	5978698	Don't send me your votes just yet, chat room.
5978718	5979638	We don't have a list yet.
5980459	5981139	You can't vote yet.
5981519	5983641	We have to have a list, and then you vote off the list.
5983681	5983901	All right.
5983921	5984381	Yes, Matt.
5984901	5988983	This would be considered the most offensive background I could find in DDR.
5989044	5991185	That would have to go to OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.
5991205	5992145	Ah, OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.
5992165	5994767	With the guy in the fucking underwear with the pistol.
5994827	5996588	That's just disturbing.
5997608	5998068	Fair enough.
5998148	5999369	OhNickPleaseNotSoQuick.
5999649	6002070	Okay, mine is Secret Rendezvous.
6002231	6003271	Secret Rendezvous.
6003311	6003611	Two chicks.
6004272	6004732	Always good.
6006633	6009896	You buy into that whole secret rendezvous about a bunch of lesbians theory?
6010936	6012598	Dude, they're rubbing up against each other.
6012818	6013078	Alright.
6014239	6014639	Fair enough.
6015600	6021385	My number two choice would be the Afranova background, but the OG one from Third Mix.
6022005	6024007	Not the newer one with the chick, the reptile thing.
6024087	6026048	Screaming into the thing.
6026068	6026429	Nope.
6029151	6029311	Nope.
6031103	6033668	We just also, by the way, our listeners did not hear what Dave just said.
6033929	6034611	Oh, I'm sorry, yes.
6035112	6038840	I said I thought the one with the reptile was the primeval.
6039682	6039802	No.
6040962	6042343	The Primeval one's all blurred.
6042363	6044724	The first one had the person screaming at the thing.
6044964	6045304	You got it.
6045805	6046685	Number one for me.
6046765	6047706	Number one choice, Jamie.
6047766	6048846	Best DDR background.
6049147	6050887	I'm no longer going to be old school at this.
6050967	6053149	I say Burning Heat just because it's Burning Heat.
6054089	6054509	Fair enough.
6054549	6055030	Burning Heat.
6055050	6055290	Okay.
6056671	6062234	I saw Burning Heat and about pooped my pants because I was having a Gradius II... Oh my god, I pooped my pants!
6062554	6065435	Because I was having a Gradius II orgasmic moment.
6065475	6066156	I saw the ninja...
6068274	6068455	Yeah.
6068675	6070737	Anyway, Matt, your number one choice.
6071057	6073560	My number one choice is back from third mix.
6073680	6076603	It has to be Get Up and Dance with the DJing Penguin.
6077725	6078466	Oh, good choice.
6078626	6079587	Good, good choice.
6081578	6083700	I like that, that's an often overlooked background.
6083760	6088003	Okay, my number one also has two things in it, like all my other ones.
6088264	6091646	Suguru, it's got the two guys in the yellow background.
6091907	6094189	Suguru, number one best DDR background.
6095029	6100254	Last one on the list, my number one choice, was also, oh Nick, please not so quick, so...
6102125	6103246	Hey, it started a revolution.
6103286	6103766	What can you say?
6105347	6110649	Unfortunately, since that was a duplicate, we're going to go ahead and let one more random one on the list.
6110669	6111870	We have Bradley back in the corner.
6111890	6112951	I'm going to put him on the spot.
6113251	6113971	You don't remember anything?
6113991	6114611	You don't know anything?
6114751	6115312	Hot Limit.
6115832	6116312	Hot Limit.
6117633	6118553	I kept getting one.
6118573	6119534	You say Summer Love.
6120214	6120694	B for you.
6121055	6121515	B for you?
6122415	6123016	Well, how about this?
6123136	6128158	One from the chat room suggested, I got a private message suggesting Breakdown with a big blue froggy thing.
6128358	6128899	Okay, Breakdown.
6128919	6129419	Alright, Breakdown.
6130356	6130656	DarkSakura.com
6148195	6151977	That'll get one vote if it doesn't get eliminated from the list, which we're going to do right now.
6152477	6153258	Here's our list.
6153538	6166845	So far we have Paranoia, In the Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Conga Feelin', Brilliant to You, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Secret Rendezvous, Afronova, Third Mix, Burning Heat, Get Up and Dance, Sugaru, Breakdown.
6166885	6171347	This is going to be a hard one to start eliminating from, but Jamie gets the first pick.
6171447	6171928	Breakdown.
6172268	6172568	Breakdown.
6173569	6178151	I'm sorry, person who suggested it, but t-shirts aren't that interesting.
6178211	6186177	It looks like they're beating each other with telephone poles.
6186197	6187577	Was it just me that thought that?
6187597	6188898	They were working in rice fields.
6188918	6189619	It was like big telephone poles.
6189639	6189919	Sugaru, gone.
6198447	6199247	Dave, your pick.
6199788	6204430	Okay, um, I guess I'll have to take off Burning Heat, because, I mean... Oh!
6204770	6208011	Although... It's a good song.
6208291	6208832	That's it.
6209132	6212493	I mean, it's not that great of a picture.
6212853	6214154	Alright, Burning Heat's gone.
6214654	6215574	This is a hard one for me.
6215594	6218516	It's not that good of a picture.
6218536	6220517	I like all these backgrounds.
6220537	6221097	Um...
6222998	6223819	There's only one.
6223919	6225660	I have to... Secret Rendezvous is out of there.
6226000	6230243	So we like the lesbian... I like the lesbian video, but the background isn't all that.
6230543	6231964	The background itself is kind of boring.
6231984	6233325	The video's good, background sucks.
6233465	6233905	So it's gone.
6234265	6236547	So here's our list starting at the beginning.
6236587	6238248	And I'm going to post this in the chat room.
6238308	6239669	You guys can vote now.
6239709	6241330	And then we're going to take a really quick break.
6241410	6242311	Just one...
6243052	6244735	One or two songs and you guys will vote.
6244755	6246077	You only have two minutes to vote.
6246518	6251126	You have to send me your votes over private message in the channel or it doesn't count.
6251226	6255775	So you've got two minutes and Jamie's now going to read the list for you guys and I'm going to post it in chat room.
6256463	6259165	As soon as Rob pulls up the thing so I can actually see it from a distance.
6259265	6259625	Thank you.
6260165	6270892	We have Paranoia, In the Mood for Dancing, Abyss, Konga Feeling, Brilliant to You, Nick Please Not So Quick, Afronova, third mix version, and Get Up and Dance.
6271332	6272593	So vote now or die.
6272953	6274054	Alright, vote now or die.
6274494	6276355	Okay, one quick song.
6276375	6277616	You've got two minutes to vote.
6277656	6280257	We're going to play one more brand new eighth style track.
6280318	6280678	This is...
6281539	6287130	and Shochiro Hirata featuring Saki with a song called It's Alright here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6363505	6364468	Thanks for watching!
6422386	6438912	Hi, sorry about that, we got dead air, I'm gonna play, uh, we're coming back, no, we're not gonna play anything else, we're just gonna come right back into this, hi, we're looking at the votes, no, we need a few more minutes to tally votes here, I'm just gonna play one quick, quick-ass song here, uh, hell, let's, oh, this song's only like a minute, so, uh, overblast.
6508464	6512845	Mr. Random Person on the Street, what do you think of the Orange Lounge Play Money Music and More Show?
6513866	6516186	Beautiful night, isn't it?
6516887	6520288	It's especially beautiful, of course, if you're a bloodsucker.
6521028	6523089	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6535123	6538624	That was a promo, a very random promo, a fan promo that was sent to us.
6538664	6547625	So if you want to make a promo for our show, put your own damn voice in it, do whatever the hell you want, send it to Orange Lounge Radio, that's all one word, at yahoo.com.
6548366	6551486	And now, announcing our listless results.
6551686	6553947	I tallied up all your votes in the chat room and here they are.
6554467	6561088	They are the results for the listless best DDR background.
6563900	6567082	I have to get a fanfare.
6569924	6574907	In third place for the best DDR background of all time, Paranoia.
6575648	6576529	Yay!
6577749	6582493	For second place, the best DDR video of all time, Abyss.
6583853	6584354	Yay!
6585274	6591358	And the very first place winner for best DDR background of all time, Get Up and Dance.
6592479	6593220	Yay!
6595168	6598869	How about some more Dollar... Let's hear the last of the Dollar and Mindy interviews now, shall we?
6599129	6599590	Let's shall.
6599750	6600090	All right.
6600770	6601570	This is very short.
6601590	6603131	We've only got a couple interviews in this segment.
6603171	6605491	It's only about three and a half minutes left of interviews.
6605531	6610973	But we do have the interview with DarkSound and the reason why the web test didn't work.
6613514	6614214	Yay, more interviews.
6614234	6618756	So go ahead and tell everyone who you are and what you do in the community.
6619352	6619932	Hey, what's up?
6619993	6621053	My name is Fuzzy Hat.
6621394	6626497	I'm basically the youngest drunkard in the DDR community and freestyler debonair.
6627458	6629720	So, what are you doing in the tourney today?
6629820	6630640	Doing freestyle?
6631121	6635924	I'm doing some freestyle, mingling with some people, macking some chicks, you know, basically all that good stuff.
6636885	6639327	And so, who do you think is your main competition for freestyle today?
6639587	6643910	My main competition will definitely have to be the drunk Wendell and also the drunk Reign of RTF.
6645533	6649756	So, do you have any parting words for the listeners or the community in general?
6650277	6657942	Listeners of the community, I just want to say that for six bucks, a picture of Heineken that fills eight glasses is not a bad deal.
6658423	6658863	That's all.
6659323	6659563	Thanks.
6660584	6665368	So now the tournament is over, and my final interview of the day goes toward the man.
6665948	6669391	So, tell us who you are and your history in the Baimani community, briefly.
6669911	6673574	Hi, I'm Ruben Abdi, otherwise known as DarkSound, the jerk-off on DDR Freak.
6674936	6679359	My DDR history started a year ago with SVM closing the day I started playing DDR.
6680000	6682141	I've been Matt Mikers ever since, I suppose.
6682281	6684483	A sign of things to come, might I say.
6685284	6685864	Just teasing.
6685984	6687245	If you're out there, Ruben, I'm just teasing.
6687606	6691789	I've been called a swiggler, an asshole, a jerk-off, and a really sexy guy.
6692189	6692950	That was me, by the way.
6693050	6693610	They called him that.
6695031	6699095	So today, we had this really cool tourney, and it was cool.
6699935	6700576	You got any questions?
6701093	6704656	Did the tournament for PA or for Freestyle turn out how you expected it to?
6706337	6713502	PA actually took not as long as I expected it to, especially with the added delay of trying to set up computers to work right.
6714843	6721247	We were planning to have a webcast going at the same time.
6721588	6724330	Fortunately, that did not happen because I forgot some cables.
6725991	6726991	You heard it here first.
6727111	6730434	He forgot cables, and that's why the webcast did not happen.
6732795	6737497	So, uh, yeah, um, took us an hour longer to set up than we thought I would.
6738178	6744020	Um, fortunately we were able to get replacement pads the other night, and, uh, everything from then on went pretty good.
6745220	6745701	Any other questions?
6746241	6749862	How about the, uh, as far as, you know, who won this and that, what do you think?
6750643	6755425	Um, I think, uh, first and second place for singles freestyle was really close, much too close.
6755885	6758426	I would have actually hoped for a tie than something made that close.
6759086	6759866	Gumby, shut the hell up.
6761187	6761287	Um...
6763431	6764311	Maybe I messed up?
6764652	6766913	What if your face is messed up, you fat-foreheaded freak?
6768113	6768713	That's right!
6769434	6773555	Dummy's in the chatroom right now, so I might say, address those cards and letters to Ruben.
6773595	6775056	I think it's DarkSound at Spiggle.
6775196	6775536	Never mind.
6776056	6778537	Yeah, I think I enjoyed Freestyle.
6778597	6779918	It was amazing.
6779958	6782239	I wish more people would have came, you flakes.
6783291	6789095	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was going to come, but I couldn't, I promise.
6789495	6791697	Yeah, stupid Soul Calibur 2 attorney.
6792577	6797540	So yeah, it was incredible, manager-like turnout, got some money, I had fun.
6797661	6799422	Oh wait, I didn't do the raffle thingy, did I?
6799662	6800743	Were there any prizes left over?
6801223	6801983	Did people just take them?
6802544	6803104	Damn, that sucks.
6803124	6803604	Okay, never mind.
6803905	6807667	But yeah, so yeah, it was an amazing day.
6808087	6810389	I enjoyed myself, it's going to be a pain in the ass to clean up, but oh well.
6811534	6815996	And what are your final words for the listeners of Orange Lodge?
6816016	6816456	DDR sucks.
6816476	6817917	Go play Mr. Driller.
6819397	6819617	Okay.
6819957	6820317	Amen.
6820337	6820618	Thank you.
6821638	6825479	And everybody, anybody have final words all at once to confuse the listeners?
6827300	6827980	Absolutely nothing.
6828441	6829741	Gummy pulled down his pants.
6830501	6831602	Yeah, I pulled down my pants.
6831982	6833803	Gummy pulled down his pants, and there you have it.
6835683	6838504	This is my last special interview with Wendell, because he's cute.
6838945	6839925	Hey, how's it going?
6841087	6844229	We're tired people and Wendell got drunk.
6844950	6846131	And Matt has my back!
6846311	6846831	Come back here!
6848432	6849213	That's how it ended.
6849493	6852415	He didn't even really interview Wendell, he just said, Hey, how you doing?
6852815	6854036	I interviewed him earlier.
6854056	6854977	Yeah, you interviewed him earlier.
6855017	6856878	But I mean, he was talking with a normal voice that time.
6856898	6859320	If you want to know what Wendell's normal voice is, there you have it.
6859380	6860781	It just happened right there.
6862176	6865158	So there's our coverage of the Valor Mindy tournament.
6865738	6867739	The first of many tournaments we'll be covering.
6867799	6870000	Hopefully I'll be able to cover one in the future.
6870781	6872582	Jamie did an excellent job with that.
6873982	6874943	Thank you for that, Jamie.
6874963	6877244	You're welcome.
6878745	6880346	I guess we're pretty much towards the end of the show.
6880406	6883567	Is there anything that you guys wanted to add here at the end of the show?
6883888	6884988	Any final thoughts from the week?
6885008	6886749	One plus one is two.
6887089	6888170	There, I added.
6889525	6890766	The lyrics to Stick Around.
6892146	6894487	Well, actually, I have something constructive.
6894808	6896568	It's the sim update for the week.
6897909	6898529	Let's see here.
6898569	6902531	We've got DWI 2 version 2.02 out.
6903592	6906233	Unfortunately, it looks like the videos in the background don't work anymore.
6906593	6907454	Thanks for watching!
6923167	6931834	Actual link yet, it's not TeamGuilo.com anymore, it's off of someone's computer, so it's an actual IP address, and I have to find that and maybe post it somewhere.
6932475	6934297	And that's about it.
6934517	6938780	Oh, and Turning Mix 2 is still going, so check out those entries if the server's not too clogged.
6939060	6939521	And that's it.
6942108	6943628	Any other final thoughts from people here?
6945409	6946709	What the hell are you doing?
6947029	6958613	Oh my god, Dave is like, we have this, we have what we call LSD here in the room, although it's actually that, I don't know if you remember this from high school, at least it was high school for me, those little nuclear warhead candies that you could put in your mouth.
6958713	6959613	It's the liquid version.
6959653	6962394	Now these are liquid versions, they come in little bottles that look like LSD.
6962734	6964995	It slipped out of my hand and down in my mouth.
6965955	6969236	You almost swallowed the actual bottle, like the whole thing.
6969256	6969336	Yeah.
6970000	6974585	He likes it so much he tried to get the very last of it by consuming the plastic.
6974645	6976927	You can just keep that bottle, because I don't even want it now.
6977368	6984235	That's why it's not safe for three-year-olds, and it's not safe for Dave either, apparently, so... Hey, did I choke?
6984695	6985076	Did I choke?
6985116	6985656	I'm still here.
6986257	6987639	The bottle is in the trash now.
6987659	6988680	You were about to choke.
6989220	6992564	She didn't do what I do and spit Propel water all over the floor, you know.
6994009	6995010	You're going to clean that up, by the way.
6995030	6995470	No, I'm just kidding.
6995670	6998573	This gag was brought to you by Gatorade.
6999774	7003777	Next week, as we mentioned towards the beginning of the show, Jamie will unfortunately not be here.
7004277	7004958	Unfortunately for us.
7004978	7005939	Unfortunately, my ass.
7005959	7007020	Yeah, fortunate for her.
7007040	7007760	I'm going to be in Vegas.
7007780	7012104	She's going to be partying in Vegas with a bunch of the other DDR freaks, so that'll be a lot of fun.
7012184	7013905	Maybe I can manage some interviews.
7014025	7015847	Maybe you should get us some interviews.
7015907	7017328	I think that would be a fine idea.
7017889	7018269	Maybe.
7019010	7019510	If you can swing.
7019530	7020431	If you're not too drunk...
7021793	7024354	You never know that more interesting ones may happen while I'm drunk.
7024995	7031918	Next week, your co-host will be the one and only Matt, also known as Loki, because he's been here every other show, so it just kind of makes sense right now.
7031958	7034760	He's been a big part of the show, so he'll be the temporary co-host.
7035455	7038036	Of course, he's always in the big... He's like our footstool, you know.
7038056	7039896	Yeah, he's... He sits on the floor.
7039916	7041056	We just rest our feet here.
7041076	7042957	I'm just going to put my feet right here.
7043377	7046197	No, he's always been a loyal supporter of the show since the beginning.
7046417	7047337	Just like everybody here.
7047858	7048758	Thanks, you guys, for showing up.
7048798	7049618	I always appreciate it.
7050218	7050998	Yeah, LeFou.
7051518	7052659	It's time for the final words.
7053219	7053559	Bradley.
7055979	7056459	Nothing to say.
7056819	7057960	Nothing to say, as usual.
7058060	7058300	Dave.
7059780	7060660	This one's for Brad.
7061140	7063201	Cunt, cock, bitch, fuck, dick.
7063541	7064661	Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.
7065854	7068837	Matt, all I have to say is M is the greatest song in the world.
7068977	7071239	Oh wait, that was V. Never mind, M sucks.
7072320	7073160	M is the greatest letter.
7075122	7075783	Dude, no.
7076443	7077124	I'm ending this show.
7077184	7078105	Oh, Jamie, any final thoughts?
7078536	7092422	My final thought is, um, tournaments need to be, you know, more like they were yesterday with just the, you know, the fun that went on and, you know, I had a good time and Matt wants my microphone and he can't have it.
7093403	7094003	And so does Dave.
7094023	7094623	God damn it!
7095084	7095564	You whores!
7096184	7096985	Team Dave for life!
7114005	7117930	Don't forget to listen to our Bimani Music and More program, always playing on the station when we're not around.
7118271	7119673	Whore out the show to all your friends.
7119733	7120694	We could use the listeners.
