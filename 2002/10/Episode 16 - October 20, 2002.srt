1
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:10,284
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a videotape!

2
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:11,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it in!

3
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:11,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it in!

4
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:20,108
[SPEAKER_13]: You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:22,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Our live talk program begins now.

6
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:25,730
Boring!

7
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: This video sucks!

8
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

9
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:42,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

10
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:45,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

11
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Hide Orange Lounge radio for the fucking children.

12
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:53,086
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

13
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:56,268
[SPEAKER_01]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:12,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

15
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,908
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of people, and assholes.

16
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,332
[SPEAKER_00]: One... ...Ranma... ...is good.

17
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Mashed it by that much.

18
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:25,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Dr. Evil's cat.

19
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,115
[SPEAKER_07]: How can you tell?

20
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I never forget a pussy.

21
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:30,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate nature!

23
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:59,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

24
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I look like the weather girl?

25
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything alright?

26
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:04,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

27
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:13,182
[SPEAKER_16]: We are live and this is episode number 16 for October the 20th, 2002.

28
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:18,645
[SPEAKER_16]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most extreme radio station of all things Bimani.

29
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,227
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

30
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:26,771
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, my lovely co-host, is stuck in a bit of traffic right now just outside of San Francisco.

31
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:31,674
[SPEAKER_16]: She gave me a call about 6 o'clock and she was stuck right before the bridge in San Francisco.

32
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,355
[SPEAKER_16]: She, by the way, this weekend went to YowieCon.

33
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,477
[SPEAKER_16]: For those that don't know what Yowie is...

34
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,192
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to tell you.

35
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, filling in for Jamie tonight, we have some guests here in studio.

36
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:06,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Please say hello to the man with the perfect attendance record.

37
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:07,549
[SPEAKER_16]: It is Loki.

38
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:08,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

39
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:13,978
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, almost with the perfect attendance record, I think you're pretty close, say hello to Dave.

40
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

41
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we have a couple more folks coming later, too, so that'll be good.

42
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:20,257
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be talking to everybody a bit later.

43
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:29,004
[SPEAKER_16]: First, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start it off with a song that I know has become one of Loki's favorite songs now, because he got to prove everybody right on something.

44
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,587
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to start this off with a song from 2DX8Style.

45
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,269
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called Sakura.

46
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:36,850
[SPEAKER_16]: And do you want to say anything about Sakura?

47
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,451
[SPEAKER_16]: I was right.

48
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll get in more to that later.

49
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:41,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and look who just walked in the door.

50
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:42,735
[SPEAKER_16]: It's some more guests.

51
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:43,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody say hello to Brad.

52
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Jamie did that a week ago.

53
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,041
[SPEAKER_16]: That was so last week, Brad.

54
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding.

55
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,484
[SPEAKER_16]: And everybody say hello to the rice princess, Irene.

56
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:53,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

57
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:55,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you guys sound so thrilled.

58
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're tired.

59
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry to hear that.

60
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:05,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we're going to start this off with something from 2DX8 style and just maybe, just maybe from the new Dance Dance Revolution.

61
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:07,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Extreme.

62
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,282
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Revenge with Sakura here on Orange Lounge Radio.

63
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

64
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't stop.

65
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

66
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:11,341
Like Jazz and Hip Hop, it makes your body and soul a future goal

67
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,220
Thanks for watching!

68
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And now DJ Lissa, rocking it, rocking it, rocking it

69
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:05,415
Thank you for watching!

70
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:23,794
Thank you for watching!

71
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:30,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

72
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio.

73
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,903
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

74
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,985
[SPEAKER_16]: And Dave's sitting there over the corner doing the little dance.

75
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:44,486
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fun.

76
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:46,487
[SPEAKER_16]: What is this?

77
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,147
[SPEAKER_16]: You never heard the catch-up song?

78
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,409
[SPEAKER_16]: After the show, I'll show you the video.

79
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,170
[SPEAKER_16]: It's these little Latina hoochies doing these little dance.

80
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:57,112
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like they're all labeling it the new Macarena.

81
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,873
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there's ever a Disney's Mix 2, you know, we're going to have the ketchup song.

82
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we had the Macarena in the first one.

83
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, happy day.

84
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,477
[SPEAKER_16]: My thoughts exactly.

85
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:19,897
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to take a minute at the very top of the show here to recognize my other show that I've been participating in for the last 20 months, understudationlive.org.

86
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:27,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And for those that didn't hear, the show came to an end, I believe, two weeks ago was the last show because Live 365 was off this past week.

87
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,241
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, there were some circumstances that developed which caused our program to go off of air.

88
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:32,422
[SPEAKER_16]: www.DarkSakura.com

89
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:09,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Revival, when he's over, he's out there in Texas, he moved out to Texas, he might do something with some new co-hosts, and I definitely would support him in doing something like that.

90
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:12,367
[SPEAKER_16]: So, big thanks to everybody at understationlive.org.

91
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:25,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, back to Orange Lounge Radio, here we are, we're back from break last week, we were also breaking last week, breaking what, I don't know, oh, breaking all-time low listening records for our tape show, that's for sure.

92
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,018
[SPEAKER_16]: No, actually, it was fine.

93
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,680
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you think of that show, Brad?

94
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,861
[SPEAKER_16]: It was interesting, wasn't it?

95
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you hear the show?

96
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I had to dump the whole tape and edit it together.

97
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:37,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard the show.

98
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:43,328
[SPEAKER_16]: It was... We always tend to get a very mixed reaction from the chat room when we do those tapes.

99
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,029
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the second time we taped a show in advance.

100
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,270
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one was the one from Scandia?

101
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,571
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the Scandia one we taped a couple weeks ago.

102
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,493
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion is the Golfland one was better.

103
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:52,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you were on it, right?

104
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,695
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wasn't on either one.

105
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:54,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were on the Golfland one.

106
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wasn't.

107
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Ted...

108
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:05,111
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was better because when you went downstairs to play Hip Hop Mania, and the person was like, what are you doing here?

109
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

110
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:15,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Keith, the wonderful, wonderful arcade technician over at Scandia that's hooking the place up with 2DX8 style, hopefully soon too, if Channel Beat...

111
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:16,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey you guys!

112
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:19,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, gee, I can't figure out who that is.

113
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,140
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:07,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it basically like gay anime?

115
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Like male gay anime with pretty boys?

116
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair enough.

117
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Loki wants to contribute something.

118
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was gay anime porn, from what I've heard.

119
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,363
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I understand, it's not really porn.

120
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:20,544
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all implied.

121
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,434
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all like implied porn, you know.

122
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,856
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how you imply porno, but just like a Skinamax film.

123
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:31,377
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like a gay Skinamax film, but it's animated in a Japanese style.

124
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:34,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that I never heard of this before.

125
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:34,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

126
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:36,609
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

127
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's for real.

128
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:04,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a joke.

129
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:05,158
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for real.

130
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're serious?

131
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm serious.

132
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:12,588
[SPEAKER_16]: That was like the very first time I ever played DDR was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention.

133
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,049
[SPEAKER_16]: And Irene was there.

134
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene was there.

135
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:15,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene knows about this.

136
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to tell you about the actual convention the first day.

137
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:23,095
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Rocky Horror Picture in one door, and right next door, the gun show.

138
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:23,755
[SPEAKER_07]: The gun show.

139
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:24,796
[SPEAKER_07]: With a bunch of hicks.

140
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:27,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And they hated Asian people, and I was so scared.

141
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:28,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh my god.

142
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:34,262
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a bunch of card-carrying NRA members mixed in with guys dressed in drag, doing the whole Frankenfurter thing.

143
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,183
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've ever seen Rocky Horror, you know what I'm talking about.

144
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:36,664
[SPEAKER_16]: If you haven't...

145
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:37,745
[SPEAKER_16]: You should.

146
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:38,165
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fun.

147
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:39,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Where you been?

148
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:39,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you been?

149
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:40,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Wake up.

150
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:40,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Go outside.

151
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:41,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop playing DDR.

152
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:42,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Put the controller down.

153
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It was scary.

154
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:44,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, bye.

155
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:59,942
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, one thing that Travis, the host over at UnderStationLive.org recommended to me was that we should take, now that that show is going to be gone, we should take some of that and bring it to Orange Lounge and just get really random on that show.

156
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you know UnderStationLive was supposed to be a Rocky Horror show, and in the beginning it was.

157
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,345
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just like we are with Bomani.

158
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing but Rocky Horror for two hours, and then it just turned into Radio Hell.

159
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:11,989
[SPEAKER_16]: But it hasn't always been Radio Hell.

160
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:12,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

161
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,910
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?

162
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here.

163
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for calling, how may I direct your call?

164
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio

165
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:50,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of, I guess the word would be ironic that we're talking about how sooner or later we'll get off topic.

166
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And while talking about this, we're getting off topic.

167
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:55,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Nah, fuck DDR, it's old.

168
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:56,215
[SPEAKER_16]: What was that?

169
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:57,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a topic?

170
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, where are all the donuts, Rob?

171
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,119
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to go get them.

172
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,120
[SPEAKER_16]: We're poor!

173
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:10,353
[SPEAKER_16]: I can give money if you want to go get donuts, but we have a show to do.

174
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:11,353
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't get donuts now.

175
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:11,914
[SPEAKER_16]: What show?

176
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:12,874
[SPEAKER_16]: This show.

177
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:13,694
[SPEAKER_16]: That's an old joke.

178
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:14,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Old joke.

179
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Surprise, we're on the internet and we've got that many people listening.

180
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:18,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god.

181
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:19,476
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough.

182
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,756
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't talk about our statistics over there.

183
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:21,996
[SPEAKER_16]: So!

184
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:25,958
[SPEAKER_16]: What do I want to talk about?

185
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,198
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so much going on.

186
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,298
[SPEAKER_16]: I said first we'd talk about... Gun shows.

187
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:30,039
[SPEAKER_16]: This was big news.

188
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,159
[SPEAKER_16]: This is actually a follow-up.

189
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Brad, gun shows.

190
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a follow-up to...

191
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:35,687
[SPEAKER_16]: www.cagames.com

192
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:54,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you should burn this.

193
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:58,696
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the Feat of Fury, which is this new release of a DDR simulator.

194
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,339
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if you'd want to call it a simulator, a clone.

195
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,842
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an emulator.

196
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,026
[SPEAKER_16]: I always get criticized on this because I call things emulators to be simulators.

197
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:07,849
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you categorize this as, Loki?

198
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:12,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just another game that's similar to DDR.

199
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically like Dance Magic Mode from Disney's Rave.

200
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:26,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just so happens to support the DWI format, sort of, because it doesn't have tempo changes, tempo stops, freeze arrows, or 12th notes.

201
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:31,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of third mix down.

202
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:34,997
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically DDR first mix type level.

203
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:42,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the simulator hasn't quite progressed, you know, obviously to that level of being on the same caliber as DDR Max.

204
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:43,879
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an early beta release.

205
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,340
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not done with everything I wanted to do yet.

206
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,701
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's an early beta that got released, but you can download this.

207
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,761
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got about, what, seven songs on it that you can play.

208
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:55,323
[SPEAKER_16]: All by the same guy, I notice, but that'll probably change with future versions.

209
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:56,323
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some decent stuff in there.

210
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to play one of the songs from Feet of Fury a little later.

211
00:20:59,184 --> 00:20:59,604
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh...

212
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:02,102
[SPEAKER_16]: Some good stuff.

213
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,083
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like Dance Magic, as you said.

214
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:09,725
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of like Street Fighter meets DDR, if you can imagine that, because you've got your characters that you pick and all this stuff.

215
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,266
[SPEAKER_16]: But I know everybody got a chance to test it for the show.

216
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just kind of wondering what you guys thought.

217
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:14,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start.

218
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:16,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's an early beta.

219
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:17,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's an early beta.

220
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:18,708
[SPEAKER_16]: It's damn impressive.

221
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:21,829
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's kind of like what I'd call a DDR first mix.

222
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:25,110
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as DDR goes, it's got a long way to go to catch up.

223
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,031
[SPEAKER_16]: But, I mean, it's still a first release.

224
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,472
[SPEAKER_16]: It's early, but it looks good.

225
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:33,455
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, a lot of Dreamcast homebrewing stuff isn't that great, but Feet of Fury is coming along very nicely.

226
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:36,857
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the idea that it's going to support your own stuff, your own DWIs and things.

227
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:44,701
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of wish there was a mode that wasn't Dance Magic, like you could play in a normal mode, but I kind of think that all that stuff is coming.

228
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,103
[SPEAKER_16]: They just want to get the initial stuff out the gate, and then they'll kind of add on to it.

229
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:52,826
[SPEAKER_16]: All that Freeze Arrows and Twelfth Nose, they'll probably come on to it later, but they've got to get their basic engine established first.

230
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for smart, they'll do that.

231
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,589
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think?

232
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,653
[SPEAKER_16]: I think if you've got a Dreamcast and a burner, there's no reason you shouldn't be going and downloading this right now and playing it.

233
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:01,333
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty cool.

234
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Brad.

235
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I understand, it's a beta and all, and I guess, you know, this is great.

236
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Star, you know, this could be, there's some possibilities and things with this.

237
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,360
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, who was the graphic designer on this thing, man?

238
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

239
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Some big Star Trek geek or something?

240
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what are the arrows?

241
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: The arrows are the shape of... Are they?

242
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:26,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make the arrows the shape of the normal arrows in DDR.

243
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:31,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's the thing, is that you don't want to copy DDR, because they're probably afraid of a lawsuit.

244
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:39,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know what, though, that if you ever play True Kiss Destination DDR, those arrows, see, those arrows look a hell of a lot like those arrows.

245
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of noticed that.

246
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:51,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on the topic of those arrows, you know, it's nice to have different arrows, but you can't tell the difference between, you know, different notes, like 4th notes, you know, 8th, 16th.

247
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have a slight color change to them, but otherwise they're just looking like these shiny Star Trek circles.

248
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:59,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why don't we just make them big circles, all of them?

249
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: They can all be circles.

250
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:01,929
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

251
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be easy to dance her, so we can't do that.

252
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:13,000
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I think that as far as it goes of actual playing quality, it's not that bad.

253
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:27,971
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like the arrows, it's really weird because they're one of the modifiers, especially, makes all the arrows spin around in place, kind of like, I forget what it is on Step Mania, do you know what the... Dizzy.

254
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Dizzy mode, where all of them spin around while going up, even though they're in the same column.

255
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:39,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And with arrows that long, they kind of overlap, so you can't tell which note is which.

256
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, right, but I mean, it's not supposed to be easy.

257
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's not supposed to be impossible to read.

258
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true, true.

259
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And also another thing I noticed is it's way too easy to get perfects.

260
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:56,541
[SPEAKER_16]: That blink thing was the most annoying one where half the arrows would disappear at a time, they'd fade in and out.

261
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:57,902
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd be able to see half of them.

262
00:23:58,122 --> 00:23:58,983
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really hard to see.

263
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,485
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't quite get how the gameplay of the game went.

264
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:07,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, maybe that's my own fault because I didn't read a manual, but hopefully they'll do a built-in tutorial later on in the game.

265
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:10,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's any story mode or anything.

266
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't look like...

267
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:16,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know, like they have in, um, Puzzle, uh, Tetris, or whatever it's called.

268
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Fighter?

269
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: No, um... God, what's a game?

270
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:20,888
[SPEAKER_05]: God, shit!

271
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:21,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Bobble?

272
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,453
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's on Super Nintendo.

273
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:24,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Bustamoo?

274
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:24,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Super...

275
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy?

276
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

277
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:31,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, here's basically what the concept of the game is.

278
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:32,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you pick a character.

279
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:35,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Each character has a different kind of attack or modifier that they do.

280
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,992
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, you know, one will have Blink, one will have Dizzy, whatever.

281
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

282
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think.

283
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Yoshi, Tetris, or Yoshi?

284
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:48,735
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dammit!

285
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:49,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it!

286
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:50,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

287
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Dammit!

288
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:56,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so basically you pick a character, and then they have different modifiers that they attack with or whatever.

289
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you're going along, you have a little bar that's kind of in the middle, and as soon as that builds up, now you can do one of two things.

290
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:10,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Either you can set to auto, where once it builds up all the way along, it'll automatically unleash the attack, or you can set to manual, to where when it builds up, you can attack whenever.

291
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with the modifier or something.

292
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:14,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

293
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,448
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like to do during that is just punch my neighbor, whoever's playing against me.

294
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: When it fills up or not, whenever.

295
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I feel like it.

296
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more effective.

297
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I look like a raccoon!

298
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:29,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they could hear you on the mic.

299
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,074
[SPEAKER_16]: It's for the best that they couldn't hear me.

300
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

301
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:35,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Tetris Attack?

302
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes!

303
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd that feel when I smashed the microphone against your hand?

304
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I said Tetris Attack earlier.

305
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:52,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the uber awesome, and I'm sorry, fuck all y'all, this game rules, Pokemon Puzzle League.

306
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:52,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you!

307
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you mean Yoshi's Cookie?

308
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,275
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I mean Pokemon Puzzle League.

309
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:59,976
[SPEAKER_16]: It was never released on Super Nintendo, it doesn't exist, it was always Pokemon.

310
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:01,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Yoshi's Cookie

311
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,274
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are you doing?

312
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,537
[SPEAKER_07]: We're making bad radio.

313
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,840
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're doing Kentucky Fried Movie.

314
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:19,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

315
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: For all our listeners who can't see.

316
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, they're supposed to add a step editor, and I haven't tried to actually make a swap CD, but you can do that too, and I don't know.

317
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:48,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm being told a few things by Twen in the chatroom, who is kind of the person who alerted us to this game in the first place, saying that the creator has stated that a main mode will be in the final version, cool, that's good to hear, and not only will you be able to put in your own DWIs and stuff, you'll be able to have your own graphic themes.

318
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,821
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to change the arrows, go to town.

319
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't waving, I was going like, way, yay, wow.

320
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:57,502
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought you were waving because you wanted to talk, I'm sorry.

321
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:06,241
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways... What other kinds of modes would you be looking forward to to see in a later version of Feat of Fury?

322
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.

323
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That just means I have to buy Dreamcast pads now.

324
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that, I'm just sticking with my PC.

325
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:21,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what I was planning to do since I'm, you know, like that, I was going to rip the songs out of that sim and put it on my sim, but, you know, that's just me.

326
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:22,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say rip?

327
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I said rip.

328
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:25,457
Shh, keep it quiet.

329
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:25,998
Shh.

330
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:30,569
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go ahead and play one of those songs from Feet of Fury real fast.

331
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to play this one song.

332
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,094
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to go into a full break, but I thought you guys would want to hear the music that goes into it.

333
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:39,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is created by a guy who did all the songs in the first release of Feet of Fury, by the way.

334
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:41,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Roddy Toomin.

335
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:42,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Toomin Mim?

336
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Toomin Mim?

337
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,701
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

338
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Also known as, and if he's listening, he's going to kill me for butchering his name.

339
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:48,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Also known as DJ Geki.

340
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:52,188
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my favorite, and the CD looks like a giant happy face.

341
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,549
[SPEAKER_16]: This happens to be my favorite song in the game.

342
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,431
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Tisanitis.

343
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:01,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm going to play this for you guys so you can sample some of the music from Feet of Fury right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

344
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:21,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, if you're just joining us, that was Titsanitis from Feet of Fear.

345
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:23,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't pronounce these damn names.

346
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:23,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Titsanasis.

347
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Titsanasis.

348
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Titsanitis, I have a cream for that.

349
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:32,894
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why I'm on the internet radio and not normal radio, along with the rest of you, might I add.

350
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:41,837
[SPEAKER_16]: I was from Feet of Fury, which is a brand new Dreamcast DDR clone type game.

351
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:46,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what the official label of it would be, but dance magic type things.

352
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:47,378
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys.

353
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:52,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Some very interesting comments were made during that song in the room here.

354
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically talking how much of an old school video game that sounds like.

355
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,721
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like level four of Blaster Master or something.

356
00:30:58,261 --> 00:30:58,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey.

357
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,802
[SPEAKER_03]: In defense of Blaster Master, it had better music than that.

358
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:04,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Blaster Master is the shit.

359
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:10,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, I know you had some pretty interesting opinions, so why don't you share with everyone else listening?

360
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, yeah.

361
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,385
[SPEAKER_07]: My plumbing was clogged.

362
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hold on.

363
00:31:18,705 --> 00:31:21,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad is the most immature person I know.

364
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:25,247
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's like four years older than you are.

365
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:30,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, um, Feet of Fury, is that what it's called?

366
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:30,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Feet of Fury.

367
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:32,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think it sucks?

368
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:33,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free!

369
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:33,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care!

370
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But the best games in life are free!

371
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:40,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, if you already have, like, third mix, fourth mix, whatever, on PlayStation, that's free.

372
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, this is, it's already been done on Disney's Rave, and I think it's just kind of cheesy, and, like, the music doesn't fit well, it doesn't dance...

373
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I couldn't dance to it.

374
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:53,296
[SPEAKER_07]: If I saw it, I wouldn't want to get it.

375
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:59,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, do you think if Loki performed some sexual favors over there and got some of his songs on the FOF, it might be a little better?

376
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a little better, but I still wouldn't play it.

377
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:11,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know, like, you know, not because of his music, but because the whole scheme of it just sucks.

378
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like, if he were to put his music on a Max scheme or something like that, or Disney's Rave, yeah, sure, I'd play it.

379
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,972
[SPEAKER_16]: So you just want to play a copy of DDR, basically, with new songs?

380
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not even just a copy, just DDR.

381
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:28,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is not, if you're going to even call this a knockoff of DDR, it's not very well done.

382
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:29,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

383
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if it is preliminary, it's just, it kind of sucks.

384
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:32,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like it.

385
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:34,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

386
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't please everybody.

387
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:36,511
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

388
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:39,893
[SPEAKER_16]: We're about a variety of opinion here on Orange Launch Radio.

389
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:40,934
[SPEAKER_07]: You suck, Irene.

390
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:41,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you.

391
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:42,735
[SPEAKER_07]: You can never please women.

392
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:44,676
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

393
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,656
[SPEAKER_16]: You can never please a woman.

394
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:46,637
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't, Robyn.

395
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:48,734
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

396
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to.

397
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,852
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think Two Panel would be better, because it's like, just running.

398
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:07,712
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Dropout.

399
00:33:08,512 --> 00:33:09,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let's just play Boom Boom Dollar.

400
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:12,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's over left, left, right, right, left, right, left, right.

401
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:16,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see, let's just play, let's see, Mickey Mouse March from Disney's Ring.

402
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That is left and right.

403
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, yep.

404
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:23,696
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I still, I still, I like Feet of Fury.

405
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,597
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's not something I'm going to play every day.

406
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,478
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just kind of something you look at and go, yeah, it's pretty cool.

407
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,058
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder what the next one's going to look like, and...

408
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,754
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at them, not me, because I'm not going to play it.

409
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're a bitch.

410
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:36,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

411
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:37,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you!

412
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to die.

413
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:43,138
[SPEAKER_16]: You know I speak the truth.

414
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:43,678
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

415
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:44,298
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

416
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:45,699
[SPEAKER_07]: You speak the truth.

417
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,259
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a bitch.

418
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:46,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thanks.

419
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I love you, Eileen.

420
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,121
[SPEAKER_16]: You know that.

421
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Now her bar got full and she punched me.

422
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:09,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I suggest we're going to take a quick break, because I need to go to potty, and I've got people yelling at me left and right to play to the channel.

423
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you guys destroying things back there?

424
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,801
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell's going on?

425
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:15,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave had a little too much to drink, so he's... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.

426
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:18,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't you have a birthday recently, Dave, or am I confusing you with someone else?

427
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Who are you talking to, Rob?

428
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:20,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Did Dave leave?

429
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:21,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

430
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, never mind.

431
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,169
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you have to look at the computer screen all the time.

432
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Do-do-do-do-do.

433
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of your house, Rob.

434
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:35,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Get off your tail and go... Okay, I'm going to put on some songs.

435
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:36,418
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to take a quick break.

436
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:44,180
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be right back and we're going to talk about Dance Dance Revolution USA and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

437
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,040
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll be right back.

438
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,120
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

439
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,205
Thanks for watching!

440
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go, let's go, let's go!

441
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:14,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Satellite control, zero, minus one hour and fifteen seconds.

442
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:25,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Warning.

443
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:33,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio's Pomani Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

444
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:43,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tile, and start stomping away.

445
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:48,113
[SPEAKER_11]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

446
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:50,613
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

447
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,114
[SPEAKER_16]: It's episode number... Whoa, and my cell phone's going off.

448
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, this is Jamie right now.

449
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see if I can pick her up on speakerphone.

450
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:57,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on a minute.

451
00:41:57,755 --> 00:41:58,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me see if I can take her on speakerphone.

452
00:41:58,795 --> 00:41:59,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, are you there?

453
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:00,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Jamie?

454
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a minute or two to show.

455
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:05,757
[SPEAKER_16]: We're on live right now.

456
00:42:05,937 --> 00:42:06,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello.

457
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:08,318
Hi, everybody.

458
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:09,438
[SPEAKER_16]: What's going on, Jamie?

459
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:10,298
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to talk to our listeners?

460
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:12,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I can barely hear.

461
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

462
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a restaurant.

463
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

464
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:16,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hungry.

465
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what's going on?

466
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

467
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:20,967
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

468
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:22,348
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to say anything to our listeners?

469
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,969
What?

470
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to say anything to our listeners?

471
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:29,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure everything was going okay.

472
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:31,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything's going great.

473
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:34,235
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cutting out on me.

474
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

475
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,035
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to say anything?

476
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:37,796
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been talking about Feet of Fury.

477
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:38,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you played that yet?

478
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:40,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I still can't hear you.

479
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,759
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been talking about Feet of Fury.

480
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:43,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you played that yet?

481
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:47,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's breaking up, I'm sorry.

482
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:49,707
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, I'll talk to you later, Jamie.

483
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

484
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:55,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you know why we can't take phone calls on this show.

485
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:57,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we need to patch in an actual phone line.

486
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:01,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we need to patch in an actual phone line, and at some point we'll be able to take phone calls.

487
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:09,740
[SPEAKER_16]: But that was my cell phone on the speakerphone, and she couldn't hear me because I guess we get really shitty reception in this room here.

488
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:14,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, you were telling a funny little story during the break.

489
00:43:14,363 --> 00:43:15,043
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to talk about it?

490
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:17,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we'll talk about it later.

491
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:18,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's orange on business.

492
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's orange on business.

493
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:23,484
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and you were listening, but that's okay.

494
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:24,306
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

495
00:43:25,828 --> 00:43:26,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think so.

496
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:35,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so unfortunately, it sounds like Jamie and them stopped to eat, so I don't think there's any way in hell she's going to make it back in time, so... Maybe they're at Dairy Queen right across the street.

497
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:36,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?

498
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:38,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you tell everyone where I live, Brad?

499
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:43,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There isn't a thousand or a million fucking Dairy Queens.

500
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:46,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, in Sacramento, there's only like, you know... Fifty.

501
00:43:46,578 --> 00:43:48,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding, I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you, I don't care.

502
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so, Feet of Fury...

503
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Any last thoughts on that?

504
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you guys were saying some more during the break.

505
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:05,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick reminder, if you are going to burn it, make sure you have the newest copy of Nero or whatever, the burning software, because I burned one.

506
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:07,874
[SPEAKER_03]: with an older copy of Nero.

507
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:26,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Those bastards, they made me lose a CD.

508
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:27,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Me too, I lost two of them.

509
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:35,256
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you want to check it out, form your own opinion on the game, kind of got a mixed reaction here so far, check it out at http://www.cagames.com

510
00:44:39,574 --> 00:45:07,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool, so moving right along, I should plug our chat room, we haven't plugged that at all tonight You're just going to join any other side IRC server like karma.othersideirc.net or irc.egheads.org And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge And that's the same server, by the way, that hosts a lot of the other big Bomani sites So if you're in one of the Bomani chat rooms right now, chances are you're on the same server as Orange Lounge Just type to join the Channel Orange Lounge Brad, why are you taking your clothes off?

511
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,033
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not ready for that point of the show yet.

512
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:13,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Woo-hoo.

513
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:16,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

514
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:19,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about, uh, I don't know.

515
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about sex, baby.

516
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:21,837
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your guys' week?

517
00:45:21,877 --> 00:45:24,097
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been about two weeks since we've all been kind of sitting here together.

518
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:24,657
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your guys' week?

519
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:25,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you do anything exciting?

520
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:28,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Any Bomani news or non-Bomani news?

521
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:29,158
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

522
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I finished my site.

523
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you tell everybody about your site.

524
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, yes.

525
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:38,715
[SPEAKER_03]: My DDR site.

526
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:44,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Twin for registering a domain name that kind of got me started on actually finishing my site.

527
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:48,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's leechfromloki.tk.

528
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:50,332
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, leechfromloki.

529
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,873
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's got a pretty cool interface.

530
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,335
[SPEAKER_03]: All that's up there right now is just two of my originals.

531
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:59,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one for Fire in the Dark and one for the Quay 2 theme.

532
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like some hard rock kind of stuff, I guess.

533
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the layout of the site, by the way.

534
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:06,622
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got that Never Look Back thing going on.

535
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:07,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

536
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:08,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the Never Look Back...

537
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:13,447
[SPEAKER_03]: G2 Arts thing is kind of my background there, and it's a pretty strange interface.

538
00:46:13,527 --> 00:46:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

539
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:18,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have tons of web space.

540
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got like 50 megs for stuff right now, and they didn't really say in the disclaimer that I couldn't have more than one site.

541
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess really I have unlimited web space and unlimited bandwidth, so that's kind of cool.

542
00:46:29,678 --> 00:46:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe later on forums will be coming up because I also have the capability to do that.

543
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:36,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, it'll be fun.

544
00:46:37,383 --> 00:46:38,184
[SPEAKER_07]: We can meet...

545
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:41,629
[SPEAKER_16]: We need orange lounge forms, so you might have to work that in for us.

546
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:42,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I could do that.

547
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:43,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, alright, good deal, good deal.

548
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I give an update on my site?

549
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

550
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:46,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 2020.

551
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:53,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

552
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,680
[SPEAKER_16]: God, you suck.

553
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:57,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

554
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to attack her.

555
00:46:59,044 --> 00:46:59,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Attack me first.

556
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

557
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:01,306
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my joke.

558
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:02,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, you suck.

559
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

560
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:03,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you can attack her.

561
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:08,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, dear God.

562
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:22,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, by the way, for those that have been bitching about how bad the Orange Lounge site has been looking, because it's really old, SoCalKicks, by the way, one of our early listeners, being one of those people that always bitched about how bad it looked, I said, fine, SoCalKicks, you do a new site.

563
00:47:22,854 --> 00:47:23,495
[SPEAKER_16]: So he said, okay.

564
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:27,156
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's supposed to be working on that for us, so we'll have a new site soon.

565
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:28,736
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I can tell you.

566
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:34,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

567
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about Max USA.

568
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:39,952
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Max USA.

569
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:40,232
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

570
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:41,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Max USA.

571
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:43,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean the one that's off by a measure?

572
00:47:43,915 --> 00:47:44,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, no, no, no.

573
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:46,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, okay.

574
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Last time, we were here in the room talking.

575
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:54,142
[SPEAKER_16]: They had released the demo on the official PlayStation magazine, and two of the songs were off by a complete measure.

576
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:59,085
[SPEAKER_16]: However, from what I understand, they released a new demo to GameStops across America.

577
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:03,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe Jamie said she has one, because her fiancé is a manager of a GameStop.

578
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:06,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

579
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:26,809
[SPEAKER_16]: What's kind of assumed to be pretty damn close to the actual list going on?

580
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,151
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you want to elaborate on that, Loki, because you look at more of that stuff than I do.

581
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:33,272
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did is they kind of got another list.

582
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:34,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty similar to the last one.

583
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:38,473
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things people were saying before is, there's not going to be ghosts, there's not going to be Kakumei.

584
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:40,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are wrong.

585
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:43,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So on this list there isn't ghosts or Kakumei because it's...

586
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: More of an update, which is kind of strange because you'd think, well, gee, you know, this list got leaked out before.

587
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not put it in when we fix the demo this time.

588
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:58,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well, you know what I bet, though, because that demo only came out about, what, a week after the list was leaked, right?

589
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,089
[SPEAKER_16]: But they probably have to do those demos to get them burned in mass and everything.

590
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,431
[SPEAKER_16]: That demo was probably done about six weeks ago.

591
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:05,172
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

592
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

593
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:08,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't matter.

594
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:19,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, one of the things that was kind of strange about it, though, is it had some newer songs on there, but those songs are the same ones from Dancing Stage Party Mix, which is kind of strange.

595
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:26,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we might see them in DDR Max USA, but I kind of doubt it.

596
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure, but...

597
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it, too.

598
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,642
[SPEAKER_16]: The way they were in the list, they were completely out of alphabetical order from the rest.

599
00:49:32,662 --> 00:49:34,003
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of weird.

600
00:49:34,163 --> 00:49:35,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But the list wasn't alphabetical in the first place.

601
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:38,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy put them in alphabetical order.

602
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:39,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I didn't realize that.

603
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:39,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

604
00:49:39,786 --> 00:49:41,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So that has nothing to do with it.

605
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:42,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still kind of weird.

606
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:47,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, when I saw when a man loves a woman on there, I was like, that cannot be in the game.

607
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:48,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

608
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but what about Be In My Paradise?

609
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:52,111
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

610
00:49:52,131 --> 00:49:54,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Be In My Paradise isn't in there, either.

611
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:55,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think.

612
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:56,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it?

613
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, um... You remember that old game, Impossible Mission, on Commodore 64?

614
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:04,149
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what you sound like right now, when you fall off the edge.

615
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:04,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah!

616
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:08,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

617
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:09,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay a while.

618
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:10,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay forever.

619
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:11,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Get him, my robots.

620
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yes.

621
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:14,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, so... Hi, world.

622
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:26,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyways, um... Some of the things that were on there, though, like, that they mentioned, that were also in Density's Party Mix, was, uh... The Bad Touch...

623
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,279
[SPEAKER_11]: You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

624
00:50:51,290 --> 00:51:00,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I do understand that Dancing Stage Party Mix is for the PS1, so I don't know how that could be carried over to the PS2 list.

625
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:02,998
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't make any sense.

626
00:51:03,118 --> 00:51:13,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I could understand if Konomics had that stuff in there or something like that, and that didn't end up being in there because they were making Dancing Stage Party Mix at the same time.

627
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have been working on the engine at the same time.

628
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:20,653
[SPEAKER_16]: My theory as to why they're not in there is in that box art that was released about four weeks ago.

629
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:25,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if... Now, one of those songs also on that list is Kylie Minogue, Can't Get You Out of My Head.

630
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:30,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, if that were actually in the game, I would think that would be the first name that would be on that cover.

631
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:34,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she's a multi-platinum-selling worldwide artist.

632
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:37,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly more well-known than Darude, I would think.

633
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I think her name would have been on there at the top billing, so I don't think that song's in there.

634
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:42,882
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it kind of voids out all the Euromix ones.

635
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:43,862
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's just my theory.

636
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:49,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you think the representatives of Kylie Minogue would want you to put that kind of a thing on the cover?

637
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Saying, oh, featuring Kylie Minogue, blah blah blah Featuring Kylie Minogue's breasts

638
00:52:16,377 --> 00:52:17,158
[SPEAKER_16]: I was walking down the street and...

639
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:45,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

640
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:47,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I have a confession to make, guys.

641
00:52:47,649 --> 00:52:47,849
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

642
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:51,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't... Don't worry, sweetie.

643
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:52,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what you think.

644
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: No, um... I haven't played DDR in over a week.

645
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:58,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

646
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:00,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Play a GaspWave file.

647
00:53:00,737 --> 00:53:01,177
[SPEAKER_04]: You have one?

648
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:01,697
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

649
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:02,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

650
00:53:03,538 --> 00:53:05,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob, get your head out of your ass.

651
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm being given some information.

652
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:09,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to see if I can give it out or not.

653
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:11,846
[SPEAKER_16]: What were you saying?

654
00:53:12,527 --> 00:53:15,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't say it because I don't know if I can give it out or not.

655
00:53:15,468 --> 00:53:16,288
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I can.

656
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:20,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, being told, okay, so maybe I'm wrong then with this news.

657
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,391
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying the box art is outdated.

658
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:25,373
[SPEAKER_16]: The yellow burst on the cover isn't really there.

659
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,174
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just there for the online version.

660
00:53:27,234 --> 00:53:28,894
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not on the real box art.

661
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:33,157
[SPEAKER_16]: So, okay, so maybe they changed it.

662
00:53:33,497 --> 00:53:34,477
[SPEAKER_16]: But I still don't think they're there.

663
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:35,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't think they're there.

664
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more important than all that, I haven't played DDR in a week.

665
00:53:41,044 --> 00:54:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, well I haven't played DDR since yesterday at home All I gotta say is, I don't care, I have it reserved, it's coming out next Tuesday I don't give a shit I think at this point, none of us really give a shit what's on it, just release the damn thing already So we can play it I'd rather be surprised, you know I already pre-ordered it too So, well, you know what is the real dilemma here?

666
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:02,408
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

667
00:54:02,528 --> 00:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes out the same day Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out I'm like, shit, I can't play both I'm just gonna take the whole week off

668
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make a version where it's all DDR music in the radio of Grand Theft Auto?

669
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know they've got the radio.

670
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:19,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

671
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:20,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

672
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:21,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch, watch.

673
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:27,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you anything the exact same day those two games come out is the day we finally get 2DX in Sacramento.

674
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,060
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you anything.

675
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:30,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going to happen the same day.

676
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I know me and probably a bunch of other people will be ripping all those songs and step files to put in.

677
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,206
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Max!

678
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:37,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god!

679
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:38,447
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to blow your load!

680
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, that's an inside room joke.

681
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:42,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, you guys.

682
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:48,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, anyways, you'll probably see the sim files out the same week, guaranteed.

683
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:49,751
[SPEAKER_16]: For what, the new stuff?

684
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:50,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah.

685
00:54:50,312 --> 00:54:52,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, you guys are crazy, you have those sim files around.

686
00:54:53,193 --> 00:55:00,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that they were already trying to find the arrow chart, we'll talk about Extreme a little later in the show, but they were already trying to find the arrow charts for Extreme.

687
00:55:00,336 --> 00:55:06,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching that one Japanese site that's got the Max 2 stuff, because they're the first ones to have the Max 2 arrow charts, and I'm waiting.

688
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:07,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Just waiting.

689
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:08,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting.

690
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:13,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I actually want to play for you an MP3 of one of the new...

691
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,274
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

692
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:45,104
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are so wrong.

693
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:46,644
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate you.

694
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:49,466
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you doing last night, Rob, when I tried to call?

695
00:55:49,786 --> 00:55:55,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want you to wait for the all caps line yelling at you guys right here in about two seconds.

696
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:57,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway... Oh, not all caps.

697
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:58,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such rude.

698
00:55:59,531 --> 00:56:01,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe you'll do that AZN type of typing.

699
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:06,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, if you like this MP3, you can go over to that site and get the rest of them.

700
00:56:06,774 --> 00:56:10,296
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the actual edit that's going to be in DDR.

701
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:12,097
[SPEAKER_16]: It is edited down to a minute and a half.

702
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:17,602
[SPEAKER_16]: about, and from what I told, it's not the actual one, but it's kind of close, whatever that means.

703
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:20,164
[SPEAKER_16]: So, take it or leave it, here it is.

704
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:26,790
[SPEAKER_16]: This is... Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, and the rest of you don't.

705
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:31,174
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to play from DDR Max USA, this is Venus with Just Leave Me Alone.

706
00:56:51,748 --> 00:56:52,775
Thank you for watching!

707
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:28,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, you heard it here first, or you heard it here second if you were already at SoCalKicks' site.

708
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:37,762
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Venus with, you just leave me alone, and that's going to be... And Brad, you should take that advice, just leave me alone, you fucking bastard.

709
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:39,684
[SPEAKER_09]: You just leave me alone, guys.

710
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:41,965
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate you so much.

711
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:45,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did I invite you over here tonight?

712
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:49,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, I needed more people here because Jamie wasn't going to be here.

713
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie's nice to me, you're mean.

714
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:55,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, hi, this is one of my other roommates, Neil, what's up?

715
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:57,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to say hello to the Bomani world?

716
00:58:57,692 --> 00:59:02,413
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could say one thing to all the Bomani nerds out there, what are you going to tell them?

717
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:03,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a life.

718
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:04,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, I knew that was coming.

719
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:06,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Now get out of the room, we're doing a show.

720
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:12,535
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you guys think of that song?

721
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:14,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that the first time you guys have heard that, most of you?

722
00:59:15,076 --> 00:59:15,676
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you think?

723
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:16,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

724
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,323
[SPEAKER_16]: What was that thing you were doing?

725
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:25,284
[SPEAKER_16]: You came out and you said, What the hell were you saying while that song was playing?

726
00:59:25,864 --> 00:59:26,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, okay.

727
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Jim Slade.

728
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:29,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

729
00:59:29,785 --> 00:59:34,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, no, but it's better than the Fetus Fury songs.

730
00:59:36,046 --> 00:59:36,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fair enough.

731
00:59:38,427 --> 00:59:39,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Dark Black Forest better.

732
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:43,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that song kicks so much ass that Dark Black Forest is going to be in DDR, but that's pretty good.

733
00:59:43,728 --> 00:59:44,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It ain't so bad.

734
00:59:44,268 --> 00:59:44,928
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you like that,

735
00:59:45,703 --> 00:59:50,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Go over to SoCalKicks.com and there's more, and maybe we'll be adding some of those to the Orange Launch playlist.

736
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:58,811
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I'm kind of holding out to get the actual rips from the actual game, which I'm sure will be out no less than 30 minutes after the game's hit shelves, if not sooner.

737
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:00,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

738
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:01,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn right.

739
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:04,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we do a list list tonight?

740
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:05,315
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to do a list list for?

741
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:11,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do a list list for something not even related to DDR.

742
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:12,375
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys think about it.

743
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:12,975
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

744
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:13,996
[SPEAKER_16]: If we got time, we'll do one.

745
01:00:14,016 --> 01:00:14,956
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done anything.

746
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:16,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done the FUs of the week yet.

747
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:17,096
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

748
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:18,677
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still going.

749
01:00:18,817 --> 01:00:19,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.

750
01:00:21,057 --> 01:00:21,678
[SPEAKER_16]: What time is it?

751
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:21,918
[SPEAKER_16]: It's 8.02.

752
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:23,278
[SPEAKER_16]: We're halfway there.

753
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:24,558
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys want to do FUs of the week?

754
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:26,159
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have anything else to add on Max USA.

755
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:26,939
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really have any.

756
01:00:27,845 --> 01:00:32,887
[SPEAKER_16]: There's really no other news on Max USA for me to report other than it's almost here.

757
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,789
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll do Extreme after the next break, because there's a lot to say on that.

758
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:39,190
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say is, Naoki is such a chick.

759
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:42,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

760
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:44,973
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone's recording the show, I want that sound clip.

761
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,975
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't look any more like a woman than he does now.

762
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,076
[SPEAKER_03]: What, is the sex change coming next?

763
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:58,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that one picture that we have of him in the New Naoki Journal, where he's at the test location, they show a backshot of him.

764
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:05,663
[SPEAKER_03]: His hair is, like, really long, and he's wearing this, like, dress suit thing that looks like a woman's... I don't even know what it is.

765
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:07,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, he looks like a chick.

766
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:08,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.

767
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, next they're going to have him in the school girl outfit, so don't worry.

768
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:13,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll know.

769
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Depeche Mode

770
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:45,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of sound clips, this is going to be very random, but... I said I'd play that, so never mind.

771
01:01:45,399 --> 01:01:47,120
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just embarrassing somebody right now, don't worry about it.

772
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:54,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you guys during the break.

773
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:57,304
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not JB.

774
01:01:57,645 --> 01:02:00,526
[SPEAKER_16]: If they fess up in the chatroom, then I'll say on air, but if they don't...

775
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:04,486
[SPEAKER_16]: If they don't, then I'll tell you guys during the break.

776
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:07,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, we've got some blackmail stuff for you.

777
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:08,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

778
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:08,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do.

779
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:09,009
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

780
01:02:10,009 --> 01:02:13,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is a... Shut up!

781
01:02:14,352 --> 01:02:15,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we won't go there.

782
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:15,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

783
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:17,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything else to say on Max USA?

784
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:18,795
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

785
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:20,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some rips about it.

786
01:02:21,177 --> 01:02:22,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's coming out earlier than expected.

787
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:23,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we mentioned that.

788
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:24,799
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be out at the end of October.

789
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Halloween week.

790
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:30,918
[SPEAKER_03]: S is coming out, not this coming up Tuesday, but the Tuesday after, supposedly.

791
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywhere that week, I guess.

792
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hearing weird things.

793
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure we'll be doing something very special on Orange Lounge.

794
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Sandstorm, yay.

795
01:02:39,621 --> 01:02:42,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I cannot wait to play Sandstorm.

796
01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:44,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Sandstorm is the best ever.

797
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:48,384
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what it's like?

798
01:02:48,924 --> 01:02:50,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like going to a giant rave.

799
01:02:50,664 --> 01:02:52,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so fucked up.

800
01:02:52,905 --> 01:02:54,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have some E and make out.

801
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:56,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can be friends.

802
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:57,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that joke is weeks old.

803
01:02:57,803 --> 01:02:58,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't do that anymore.

804
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:04,271
[SPEAKER_03]: We did hear what the last song to unlock is, supposedly.

805
01:03:04,391 --> 01:03:04,832
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

806
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:05,813
[SPEAKER_03]: The Drop the Bomb one?

807
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop the Bomb, yeah.

808
01:03:07,856 --> 01:03:08,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

809
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:09,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new one.

810
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay for dropping bombs.

811
01:03:12,242 --> 01:03:12,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Drop the bomb.

812
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:16,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they really would drop the goddamn bomb.

813
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:17,439
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing is so annoying.

814
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:24,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of Scottie D's finest songs, Stick Around.

815
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:30,811
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you can see Scottie D for like half a second in the Stick Around video, right before the gerbils that make out with each other.

816
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:35,615
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the worst video slash song ever.

817
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:36,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I disagree.

818
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:37,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song.

819
01:03:37,236 --> 01:03:37,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

820
01:03:37,836 --> 01:03:39,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're stupid.

821
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:44,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of... Okay, well, anyways, this is way off topic.

822
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:50,722
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that song that's in Guitar Freak's 8th mix, or whatever, that's, um, it's Paul Terry and some other band.

823
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:52,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, she totally butchers that song, too.

824
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to talk about Politary not being able to sing?

825
01:03:57,476 --> 01:04:00,080
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that one song featuring Angel?

826
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,601
[SPEAKER_07]: She cannot sing.

827
01:04:01,642 --> 01:04:03,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Ultra High Heels or something like that?

828
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:05,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Ultra High Heels.

829
01:04:05,526 --> 01:04:07,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but that chick cannot sing.

830
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:09,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Politary has a voice, but that chick doesn't.

831
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:10,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, bye.

832
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:11,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Megu cannot sing.

833
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:15,517
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why you listen to me?

834
01:04:15,537 --> 01:04:18,278
[SPEAKER_16]: The only shitty thing about Stick Around is the lyrics.

835
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:20,238
[SPEAKER_16]: The lyrics are so awful.

836
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:21,099
[SPEAKER_09]: They're awful.

837
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:22,099
[SPEAKER_09]: They're goddamn awful.

838
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:22,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it bigger.

839
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Video is terrible.

840
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,780
[SPEAKER_07]: The singing is terrible.

841
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:27,141
[SPEAKER_07]: The lyrics are terrible.

842
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: The song is terrible.

843
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:29,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, I don't know.

844
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have to defend it.

845
01:04:30,822 --> 01:04:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The music itself is alright.

846
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:34,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The singing is alright.

847
01:04:34,264 --> 01:04:35,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Miracleman.

848
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:37,025
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cute though.

849
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:37,925
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all happy and...

850
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:40,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid!

851
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:44,128
[SPEAKER_16]: And the video, it looks like, at the very beginning of the video, it looks like we're going to go on a safari.

852
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:47,089
[SPEAKER_07]: God, why don't I just put on the Discovery Channel?

853
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,830
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I'll hear better music.

854
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, speaking of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, I'm glad you brought this up.

855
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,512
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to mention this real fast.

856
01:04:53,532 --> 01:05:01,695
[SPEAKER_16]: For the first time, it sounds like they're going to be doing what they're calling Power Up, which is basically 8th Mix, 7th Mix Plus.

857
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:04,576
[SPEAKER_16]: They're doing a new version of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania called the Power Up.

858
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:08,378
[SPEAKER_16]: And from what we're being told, there's going to be some new songs in it

859
01:05:09,847 --> 01:05:14,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Begin by Ryu Kisoka, which is one of the B4U chicks, if I'm not mistaken.

860
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:16,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Ryu, oh sorry, I missed the I, my bad.

861
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:19,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Power Up.

862
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shit.

863
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're returning.

864
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:26,391
[SPEAKER_16]: They're putting in some more of the old songs that are coming back, like Fire in the Dark, and On Our Way.

865
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:27,352
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Haru Spring?

866
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:29,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't Haru Spring in?

867
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Those bastards.

868
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:39,015
[SPEAKER_16]: I only played it once, and Jamie made me play Another World, and then I played some other... Oh, I played the one where you do the steel drums.

869
01:05:39,195 --> 01:05:39,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Kachaka.

870
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Kachaka.

871
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:40,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked that one.

872
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:41,336
[SPEAKER_05]: That was cool.

873
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:42,836
[SPEAKER_05]: My third favorite song.

874
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:44,577
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a shitty grade, but I did good.

875
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:45,717
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what's the...

876
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:49,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Extra Stage is called, it's in Japanese, but it's really, really fun.

877
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:50,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it the Orange Lounge song?

878
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the characters, but the two girls, you know, but I don't think it's Orange Lounge.

879
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,444
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the coolest song ever.

880
01:05:58,364 --> 01:05:58,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.

881
01:05:58,805 --> 01:06:00,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The Extra Stage on Drum Mania Guitars.

882
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:04,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure some people in our chat room will fill us in on that.

883
01:06:04,868 --> 01:06:05,749
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hyper and peppy.

884
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,851
[SPEAKER_04]: We honky, we don't know how to read Japanese.

885
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:10,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, let's take a break.

886
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:10,982
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys want to play?

887
01:06:11,002 --> 01:06:12,082
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no ideas.

888
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:13,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Any requests in here?

889
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:14,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Play ABBA.

890
01:06:14,723 --> 01:06:15,423
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no ABBA.

891
01:06:16,163 --> 01:06:16,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh!

892
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:17,123
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

893
01:06:17,604 --> 01:06:18,324
[SPEAKER_16]: We will do ABBA.

894
01:06:18,944 --> 01:06:19,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I was kidding.

895
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:20,625
[SPEAKER_16]: I was only kidding.

896
01:06:20,885 --> 01:06:22,965
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're going to do... You got me started.

897
01:06:23,005 --> 01:06:24,326
[SPEAKER_16]: We did Hyper Boundary Gate before the show.

898
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:24,946
[SPEAKER_16]: You were in the other room.

899
01:06:24,986 --> 01:06:25,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we could do Michael Bolton.

900
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:26,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, no.

901
01:06:27,507 --> 01:06:27,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael Bolton?

902
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:32,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do... When a man becomes a woman.

903
01:06:33,348 --> 01:06:34,009
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll do some ABBA.

904
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:36,549
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do erotic covering ABBA, though.

905
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:37,590
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're going to play.

906
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:45,682
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in the meantime, we're going to start this set off with... I don't know.

907
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:46,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I like this one.

908
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,004
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one of my favorite songs from 2DX.

909
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:48,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll start off with this.

910
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:50,005
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.

911
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:55,388
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be right back, and then we're going to talk about DDR Extreme and the FUs of the week.

912
01:06:55,468 --> 01:07:01,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, if you want to send me your FUs of the week over private message, you can do that now in the chat room, and we'll get to that coming back.

913
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:09,180
Thanks for watching!

914
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:09,951
Thanks for watching!

915
01:09:56,397 --> 01:10:00,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my only fight Now I didn't dream Now everything is new

916
01:10:24,126 --> 01:10:25,332
Thanks for watching!

917
01:11:06,799 --> 01:11:16,684
Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love

918
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:33,043
Thank you for watching!

919
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:31,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song Orange Lounge Radio

920
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:44,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I had to play that again, because everybody in here, Dave was laughing so hard the first time, the others couldn't hear it, so, I know we've got more people joining us since we started the show, but it's very rare we get a new promo around here, so, had to play that for you guys.

921
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:58,276
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a clarification during the break, by the way, you are listening to Orange Launch Radio, we were talking about Guitar Freaks 8th and Drum Mania 7th before the break, and thank you to Arcadian42 who's filling us in, saying that the extra stage is called Mikene Ko Rock.

922
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:03,136
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not Mechanical, it's Japanese.

923
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:03,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Mikaniko.

924
01:14:03,536 --> 01:14:04,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Mikaniko.

925
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:04,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Rock.

926
01:14:04,977 --> 01:14:05,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Rock.

927
01:14:05,518 --> 01:14:08,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like Mechanical, but... Remember there's that cat, Parfait, the cat?

928
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, the cute little cat.

929
01:14:11,003 --> 01:14:13,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Aw, if Justin's listening, I'm sure he likes that.

930
01:14:13,205 --> 01:14:14,746
[SPEAKER_16]: We gotta have them back on the show, by the way.

931
01:14:15,086 --> 01:14:16,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Justin and Mike, they were here a few weeks ago.

932
01:14:17,478 --> 01:14:18,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, a few months ago with this man.

933
01:14:19,018 --> 01:14:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they need to return my freaking Beatmania 5-key controller.

934
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:23,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh.

935
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,740
[SPEAKER_03]: About time I got that thing back.

936
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're both listening, so if you want to put out a special shout-out.

937
01:14:28,621 --> 01:14:29,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Need controller.

938
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:30,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Want the controller.

939
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:32,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't play Beatmania without a controller.

940
01:14:33,222 --> 01:14:39,803
[SPEAKER_16]: And Arcadian thinks that the long version extra stage is something like Sumi, Nagra, Kanojo, but not sure.

941
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:42,744
[SPEAKER_05]: The bonus stage extra stage is crap.

942
01:14:43,224 --> 01:14:43,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

943
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:43,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you.

944
01:14:44,004 --> 01:14:46,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's okay, but it's not worth playing.

945
01:14:48,644 --> 01:14:50,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song, Power.

946
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:52,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

947
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:55,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Power.

948
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,269
[SPEAKER_16]: You just like Power, don't you?

949
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:58,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Power, and I also like Candy Star.

950
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:00,811
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really like that one.

951
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I was expecting to play the actual Candy.

952
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,214
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be worse, though.

953
01:15:05,494 --> 01:15:06,415
[SPEAKER_16]: It could have had Crash.

954
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:14,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Crash is the Ingress version of one of those songs.

955
01:15:15,388 --> 01:15:16,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Breakdown, thank you.

956
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell can't I... God, I can't think of it.

957
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:21,309
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but see, it's bad because they have Under Control.

958
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:23,369
[SPEAKER_05]: The worst song ever.

959
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

960
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:31,551
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle isn't that bad, but the beginning is Crash and Burn, Crash and Burn the whole time.

961
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:32,811
[SPEAKER_05]: It's annoying.

962
01:15:33,231 --> 01:15:34,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds like GWAR or something.

963
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:37,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, DDR Mike says you'll get it back when they go to Shafton.

964
01:15:39,813 --> 01:15:40,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go do Shaft.

965
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:41,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody.

966
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody should go to Shaft.

967
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:46,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Come get some Shaft on November 9th over at Scandia.

968
01:15:46,615 --> 01:15:50,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm working on those flyers, so we'll have those.

969
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be cool.

970
01:15:55,038 --> 01:15:56,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let's do the FUs of the week.

971
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie's not here, but if she were here...

972
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:01,197
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

973
01:16:15,495 --> 01:16:16,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Brad, you have an FU of the week.

974
01:16:16,635 --> 01:16:17,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Hangovers.

975
01:16:18,016 --> 01:16:18,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, why is that?

976
01:16:19,757 --> 01:16:20,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they're not fun.

977
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,059
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you're supposed to drink bread and eat water when you're getting drunk.

978
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:26,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Drink bread and eat water.

979
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what I just said?

980
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm dyslexic, I'm sorry.

981
01:16:31,561 --> 01:16:32,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Dyslexic?

982
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:34,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, that's not that big of a deal.

983
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:37,184
[SPEAKER_16]: How about you, Rob?

984
01:16:37,204 --> 01:16:38,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have an FU of the week?

985
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:39,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I have an FU of the week?

986
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:39,905
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure yet.

987
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:40,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to the others.

988
01:16:40,685 --> 01:16:40,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki?

989
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:41,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, how about Dave?

990
01:16:41,986 --> 01:16:43,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave, do you have an FU of the week?

991
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:44,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

992
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:45,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

993
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to all my teachers at school for giving me way too much homework.

994
01:16:50,130 --> 01:17:03,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed, like, one day of school, I think, like, two weeks ago, and somehow it was the one day where all the teachers assigned about ten assignments for the next two weeks of school, and so I missed that day, and now I've got a million assignments.

995
01:17:03,841 --> 01:17:05,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you, teachers!

996
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:06,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're listening!

997
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:08,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Go away!

998
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:10,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

999
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:13,009
[SPEAKER_00]: You get detention for a whole year!

1000
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:14,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Some advice.

1001
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't miss school.

1002
01:17:16,147 --> 01:17:16,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay in school, kids!

1003
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:19,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Be cool, stay in school!

1004
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so what if you're sick?

1005
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:21,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Step into a Slim Jim!

1006
01:17:22,452 --> 01:17:23,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah!

1007
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:29,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyways, uh, my FQ of the week has... Wait, hold on.

1008
01:17:29,337 --> 01:17:33,660
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was going to stay in school, then I threw up over someone else's backpack.

1009
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Eww!

1010
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:36,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, go to the office.

1011
01:17:36,202 --> 01:17:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Eww!

1012
01:17:37,022 --> 01:17:37,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Grody!

1013
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:38,544
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't give me a chance.

1014
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much is funnier than vomit, seriously.

1015
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:41,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, guys.

1016
01:17:43,018 --> 01:17:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, my F.U.

1017
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:48,501
[SPEAKER_03]: of the week, once again, goes to Golfland Sunsplash.

1018
01:17:49,742 --> 01:17:50,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Again!

1019
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:51,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Big fat surprise.

1020
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:52,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

1021
01:17:52,664 --> 01:17:56,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, let's start with the fact that initial D's broken already.

1022
01:17:56,406 --> 01:17:56,626
[SPEAKER_03]: What?!

1023
01:17:57,526 --> 01:17:58,427
[SPEAKER_03]: What?!

1024
01:17:59,107 --> 01:17:59,908
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is broken.

1025
01:17:59,948 --> 01:18:01,569
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's unacceptable.

1026
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:02,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Unacceptable.

1027
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:03,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Unacceptable.

1028
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of that one being broken, I had to wait for over half an hour to play one game of it today.

1029
01:18:10,147 --> 01:18:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the new DDR or something.

1030
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:13,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Unacceptable.

1031
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:22,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that and also because the fact that they're advertising that MechWarrior 4 is in the Sumo, but for some reason it's not there anymore.

1032
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't play MechWarrior 4.

1033
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:28,656
[SPEAKER_16]: So those bastards that put in money... Wait a minute, I played MechWarrior 4 on that thing.

1034
01:18:29,377 --> 01:18:29,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Now.

1035
01:18:30,097 --> 01:18:31,337
[SPEAKER_16]: So somebody downgraded it?

1036
01:18:31,658 --> 01:18:32,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess.

1037
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:34,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Major props to those guys.

1038
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:35,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Major props.

1039
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,141
[SPEAKER_16]: That takes talent to be that stupid.

1040
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:40,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Speed Demon game!

1041
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:42,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that game!

1042
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:44,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I own that game.

1043
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I still own that game for almost free.

1044
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:49,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for free because I have to pay for it.

1045
01:18:49,928 --> 01:18:53,190
[SPEAKER_04]: But... You could always steal little kids' tokens.

1046
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:56,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Or... Rent it for a small fee.

1047
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:01,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do that when I can just play like a dollar and win a thousand tickets?

1048
01:19:01,095 --> 01:19:02,776
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do with the tickets?

1049
01:19:02,976 --> 01:19:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: You win like a thousand tickets and then what?

1050
01:19:04,436 --> 01:19:06,237
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to take something that's worth a dollar?

1051
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:07,498
[SPEAKER_05]: You get stuck!

1052
01:19:07,918 --> 01:19:08,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought...

1053
01:19:09,724 --> 01:19:20,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent probably about $5 or $4 playing that game, which is a lot of money, and I got a Glitter CD rack, which holds... Ooh, Glitter!

1054
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Mariah Carey Glitter?

1055
01:19:24,028 --> 01:19:29,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks kind of like the inside of one of those lava lamp type things with all the tons of balls in them like that.

1056
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:32,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And it lights up.

1057
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:34,532
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

1058
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1059
01:19:37,196 --> 01:19:42,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It holds many CDs, and I... I have balls, I just don't like balls.

1060
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:45,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1061
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:47,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1062
01:19:47,839 --> 01:19:49,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene, do you have any FUs of the week?

1063
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:50,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's change topics.

1064
01:19:51,139 --> 01:19:51,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like balls?

1065
01:19:53,060 --> 01:20:05,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I'm kind of sort of pissed off at my car because it kind of broke down, but I'm even more pissed off at book and automotive stores for not carrying the repair manual for my car, so fuck you.

1066
01:20:05,503 --> 01:20:06,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.

1067
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:08,117
[SPEAKER_16]: You have another FU, Brad?

1068
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:11,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you already did.

1069
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:17,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, drink that bread, guys.

1070
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:17,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for ya.

1071
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1072
01:20:20,144 --> 01:20:21,044
[SPEAKER_16]: I have an FU of the week.

1073
01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about time.

1074
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:25,027
[SPEAKER_16]: My FU of the week is to Brad for being such an asshole.

1075
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're special and you get Baclois.

1076
01:20:27,468 --> 01:20:28,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I am special.

1077
01:20:30,973 --> 01:20:32,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, my mommy told me so.

1078
01:20:33,275 --> 01:20:36,398
[SPEAKER_16]: My FU of the week would go to the entire week itself.

1079
01:20:36,978 --> 01:20:40,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to talk about it on the show, but for those that know me, it was a really shitty week.

1080
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:42,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's just leave it at that.

1081
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:43,143
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my FU of the week.

1082
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:44,004
[SPEAKER_16]: It's to the whole week.

1083
01:20:44,384 --> 01:20:45,345
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole damn thing.

1084
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:46,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck it.

1085
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:49,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get to the chat room.

1086
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,153
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate myself and I want to die.

1087
01:20:55,313 --> 01:20:56,534
[SPEAKER_16]: I slashed my wrist the other day.

1088
01:20:56,575 --> 01:20:56,995
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

1089
01:20:57,035 --> 01:20:57,735
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't do that, but...

1090
01:21:01,992 --> 01:21:04,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, you would probably be here.

1091
01:21:06,336 --> 01:21:06,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1092
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:10,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about the chatroom FUs, those that have been sent to me, shall we?

1093
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:11,740
How are you?

1094
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:13,042
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to read one?

1095
01:21:13,262 --> 01:21:14,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let's see.

1096
01:21:14,283 --> 01:21:16,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, read SoCalKicks' then.

1097
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:16,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Read that one.

1098
01:21:17,837 --> 01:21:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKick says, FooSky, actually he means F-U, F-U Sky for saving that sound clip.

1099
01:21:24,544 --> 01:21:25,845
[SPEAKER_16]: You know that Me So Hungry one?

1100
01:21:28,948 --> 01:21:38,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you everyone who can't understand what I said, it's Hungy, not Hunky, and fuck you PSATs because I got worried for nothing, they were the easiest shit ever.

1101
01:21:42,987 --> 01:21:46,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I read that it said hongi, I just thought it sounded funnier as hongi.

1102
01:21:46,308 --> 01:21:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, SoCalCake.

1103
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:50,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Twin sent me some FUs earlier.

1104
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:53,551
[SPEAKER_16]: People stomping on the PPP machine, which makes no sense at all.

1105
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:57,692
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, I saw some girl playing it completely with her feet.

1106
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess she didn't understand.

1107
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:02,135
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're, you know... It's a hand game.

1108
01:22:02,275 --> 01:22:03,235
[SPEAKER_04]: It's infrared sex.

1109
01:22:03,396 --> 01:22:04,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Russian Dance Revolution.

1110
01:22:04,957 --> 01:22:07,058
[SPEAKER_04]: You use your feet to hit all the heroes.

1111
01:22:08,499 --> 01:22:11,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's like a gun there for you to shoot yourself, you know, Russian Roulette.

1112
01:22:11,882 --> 01:22:16,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever think, by the way, if they did release an American version of PPP, the catch-up song would be on it?

1113
01:22:16,385 --> 01:22:17,085
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you anything.

1114
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:27,873
[SPEAKER_16]: An F you to the chat room for somehow going into invite only on Friday night.

1115
01:22:27,893 --> 01:22:28,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was my fault.

1116
01:22:28,834 --> 01:22:29,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you.

1117
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm only human, you ass!

1118
01:22:34,066 --> 01:22:36,811
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to JB's dad for wanting to go online so he had to leave.

1119
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:38,014
[SPEAKER_16]: But he's back now, so never mind.

1120
01:22:41,004 --> 01:22:42,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Black Lab sent me one before he had to go.

1121
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:44,425
[SPEAKER_16]: He was here earlier, but he had to go.

1122
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:49,267
[SPEAKER_16]: He says, fuck his parents' shitty computer for being slow and the only computer in the house.

1123
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:53,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck his little brother for being such a little dickhead this weekend that he's had to watch him.

1124
01:22:53,748 --> 01:22:58,289
[SPEAKER_16]: And fuck Star Fox Adventures on GameCube for being too goddamn easy since I beat it in 13 hours flat.

1125
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:00,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I only played it for five minutes, and I knew it sucked.

1126
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:01,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1127
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:03,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even have to play it, and I can tell it sucks.

1128
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:03,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1129
01:23:04,431 --> 01:23:07,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, 23rd Magus says, fuck you to the cold virus for keeping me home all weekend.

1130
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:10,534
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have been at RVGL Saturday for Arcade Mania for once.

1131
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:11,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck the cold.

1132
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:12,075
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

1133
01:23:12,135 --> 01:23:12,995
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't miss anything.

1134
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:14,496
[SPEAKER_16]: All the machines are broken.

1135
01:23:15,216 --> 01:23:20,959
[SPEAKER_16]: JB says, uh, his FU is to RVGL.

1136
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:24,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, little kids like to grab asses at RVGL.

1137
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,000
[SPEAKER_16]: He's learned.

1138
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, isn't that something?

1139
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:28,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, he told me this.

1140
01:23:28,602 --> 01:23:32,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It was literal as in, I think, like, really literal.

1141
01:23:33,184 --> 01:23:33,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Like,

1142
01:23:33,857 --> 01:23:38,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Very little kid, like a girl or something, I don't know, like four or eight or something.

1143
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:40,040
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it was a chick grabbing his ass.

1144
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if there was a five-year-old kid grabbing his ass, that would be kind of creepy.

1145
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:46,683
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Anna Nicole Smith Jr.

1146
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:52,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Either way, it's illegal, so come on.

1147
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,946
[SPEAKER_16]: JB would also like to state that Jenny Rom will be his future wife.

1148
01:23:55,306 --> 01:23:56,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, sure.

1149
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I was Japanese for a minute there.

1150
01:23:58,428 --> 01:23:58,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Wife!

1151
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:01,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Watch the movie Simone.

1152
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:09,030
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Mike says that... Oh, this isn't an FU.

1153
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,531
[SPEAKER_16]: He's telling me when he's going to come visit.

1154
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:11,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Never mind, that's not an FU.

1155
01:24:12,452 --> 01:24:15,114
[SPEAKER_16]: DCB says FU to himself for coming in late.

1156
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:16,635
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one tardy.

1157
01:24:19,177 --> 01:24:20,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Detention for a whole week.

1158
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:22,099
[SPEAKER_16]: For DCB.

1159
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,033
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, some guy in the chat room.

1160
01:24:27,594 --> 01:24:28,994
[SPEAKER_16]: These people, they're all my best friends.

1161
01:24:29,054 --> 01:24:30,395
[SPEAKER_16]: I keep tabs on them all the time.

1162
01:24:30,415 --> 01:24:31,795
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't know, they just come in on Sunday night.

1163
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:34,096
[SPEAKER_16]: I read their FUs and they're happy.

1164
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,177
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how this show works.

1165
01:24:37,017 --> 01:24:42,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Jazz says, FU to negative, immature people who seemingly can only solve problems with violence.

1166
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: But violence is the only way.

1167
01:24:47,841 --> 01:24:48,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

1168
01:24:49,462 --> 01:24:50,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki...

1169
01:24:55,643 --> 01:24:55,823
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1170
01:24:56,203 --> 01:24:57,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do they use violence?

1171
01:24:57,324 --> 01:24:58,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they use cellos?

1172
01:24:58,824 --> 01:24:59,864
[SPEAKER_16]: That's violence, dear.

1173
01:24:59,884 --> 01:25:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Like guns.

1174
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:06,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Jazz is cool.

1175
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:11,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Slinky says, F you to Roseville Golf Land because it's a shithole and everything is broken.

1176
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:14,228
[SPEAKER_16]: The game room and Scandi are 600 times better.

1177
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:16,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Once again, getting into local DDR politics on this...

1178
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,020
[SPEAKER_16]: International Program, but that's okay.

1179
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody should know what a shithole Roseville Golf Land is.

1180
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly, maybe one of the assholes from Golf Land will be listening.

1181
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:26,522
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what I heard?

1182
01:25:26,702 --> 01:25:31,003
[SPEAKER_16]: You remember that one time that I went over there and took pictures of all the broken shit?

1183
01:25:31,123 --> 01:25:33,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the employees got online and saw that, and they were pissed.

1184
01:25:34,164 --> 01:25:35,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Pissed about what?

1185
01:25:35,324 --> 01:25:36,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Pissed about what?

1186
01:25:36,085 --> 01:25:37,205
[SPEAKER_04]: That I'm telling the truth?

1187
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:39,175
[SPEAKER_16]: God!

1188
01:25:39,975 --> 01:25:40,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you!

1189
01:25:40,395 --> 01:25:41,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm going to do it again!

1190
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:42,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for that!

1191
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:50,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I'm going to take pictures of you when you're picking your nose and taking breaks when you shouldn't be and telling off little kids and pissing in the cokes and whatever you do over there.

1192
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:51,438
[SPEAKER_05]: F you!

1193
01:25:51,638 --> 01:25:52,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you!

1194
01:25:52,138 --> 01:25:52,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Die!

1195
01:25:53,479 --> 01:26:01,641
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but see, like, they just really actually did the first pecking that they've done in a couple of months and they fixed Guitar Freaks and Keep Working.

1196
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you went there now, a lot of stuff wouldn't be broken.

1197
01:26:04,722 --> 01:26:05,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They turned up...

1198
01:26:06,642 --> 01:26:10,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you went there now, I'm sorry, you'd probably see everything broken again.

1199
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:12,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I went there earlier today.

1200
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,408
[SPEAKER_04]: The Guitar Freaks was turned up really loud, nice and loud.

1201
01:26:15,768 --> 01:26:17,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Drum Mania is turned down almost to silent.

1202
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:22,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me add that I played Guitar Freaks for the first time in a long time a couple days ago.

1203
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: and my ears were ringing afterwards.

1204
01:26:25,307 --> 01:26:26,028
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so loud.

1205
01:26:26,988 --> 01:26:27,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dumb.

1206
01:26:28,288 --> 01:26:34,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they don't realize that these games are based on music and you need to kind of make it sound good or else it's not worth playing.

1207
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play Godard Freaks in silence.

1208
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:39,511
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm told that Roseville isn't the only golf land that's having problems apparently.

1209
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:42,212
[SPEAKER_16]: SHGL got their 2DX screen fixed.

1210
01:26:42,352 --> 01:26:42,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even...

1211
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me.

1212
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:45,640
[SPEAKER_16]: I burped on the radio.

1213
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:49,603
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even know that SHGL got 2DX back, but apparently they did.

1214
01:26:49,863 --> 01:26:51,945
[SPEAKER_16]: They got their screen fixed, and now it's broken again.

1215
01:26:52,265 --> 01:26:56,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So, hey, it runs in the family, I guess.

1216
01:26:56,569 --> 01:27:03,014
[SPEAKER_07]: We should just go to all the golf lands and quote, end quote, overplay the games and make all of them...

1217
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:20,462
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, wanting the arcade doctor and then they'll see how bad it's going to affect yeah I need to pay a visit to the arcade doctor is that all the girlfriends do that or is that just Roseville who cares I think they know what I am implying but they'll see how much it suffers you know, like you know

1218
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:25,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they'll see how much people don't like it, and then they won't get any business, and they'll die.

1219
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:25,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, bye.

1220
01:27:25,939 --> 01:27:26,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yeah.

1221
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, you can't go play the games if they're all broken already.

1222
01:27:29,581 --> 01:27:30,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to make any money.

1223
01:27:31,322 --> 01:27:35,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the ones that are still working, we should just overplay them.

1224
01:27:35,745 --> 01:27:36,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, don't quote.

1225
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:37,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I want to finish up.

1226
01:27:37,526 --> 01:27:38,187
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some FUs.

1227
01:27:38,507 --> 01:27:40,028
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Mike did send an FU after.

1228
01:27:40,308 --> 01:27:41,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes, Irene, you have an FU.

1229
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:43,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not quote, unquote.

1230
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:45,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quote, end quote.

1231
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:47,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you unquote something?

1232
01:27:48,033 --> 01:27:49,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody please tell me.

1233
01:27:49,594 --> 01:27:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1234
01:27:50,335 --> 01:27:51,395
[SPEAKER_07]: End quote.

1235
01:27:51,415 --> 01:27:51,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You lose.

1236
01:27:51,896 --> 01:27:52,316
[SPEAKER_16]: You lose.

1237
01:27:54,737 --> 01:28:00,861
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Mike says, F you to Mountain Mike's left side pad down arrow because it's stuck for three minutes straight on Saturday night.

1238
01:28:02,062 --> 01:28:02,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, wait, Rob.

1239
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good for freeze arrows.

1240
01:28:04,184 --> 01:28:04,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1241
01:28:04,564 --> 01:28:05,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I have another F you.

1242
01:28:05,464 --> 01:28:06,865
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to you.

1243
01:28:07,326 --> 01:28:07,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys...

1244
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody hates me.

1245
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:11,082
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have any vanilla Cokes, though.

1246
01:28:11,382 --> 01:28:11,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

1247
01:28:11,742 --> 01:28:12,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Go buy one yourself.

1248
01:28:13,003 --> 01:28:13,204
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1249
01:28:13,264 --> 01:28:14,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sick of buying you people crap.

1250
01:28:15,205 --> 01:28:15,365
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1251
01:28:15,566 --> 01:28:16,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just ghetto poor this week.

1252
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:17,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't been to the store.

1253
01:28:17,367 --> 01:28:18,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to the store after the show.

1254
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:22,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that I'll do you any good until next week, but hey, just thought you'd enjoy doing that.

1255
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:23,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks a lot.

1256
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:25,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry, I'll bring Krispy Kreme one day.

1257
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:26,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Some advice.

1258
01:28:26,694 --> 01:28:27,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a job.

1259
01:28:27,195 --> 01:28:31,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Slinky's follow-up is that Japanese people own us all, and that's not local.

1260
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remember I said his local mom.

1261
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:36,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And their simple kick-ass, I might add.

1262
01:28:39,437 --> 01:28:40,178
[SPEAKER_16]: That's enough, Harspring.

1263
01:28:41,659 --> 01:28:44,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Or as SoCalKick says, shine loose.

1264
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:48,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move along here.

1265
01:28:48,484 --> 01:28:49,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, thank you, teacher.

1266
01:28:49,665 --> 01:28:51,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for telling us how to run the show.

1267
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:51,706
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm just kidding.

1268
01:28:52,007 --> 01:28:52,287
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.

1269
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:53,047
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to hurry up.

1270
01:28:53,288 --> 01:28:56,090
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to get to do listless if we don't talk about DDR Extreme.

1271
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:56,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that.

1272
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait until next week.

1273
01:28:58,872 --> 01:29:00,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's talk about DDR Extreme.

1274
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,136
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to say?

1275
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:06,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you do a sim file update for us, Loki, and then lead on into DDR Extreme if you want.

1276
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:08,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Go for it, dude.

1277
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:09,520
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the one who wants to change topics.

1278
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,300
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all you.

1279
01:29:10,941 --> 01:29:13,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off with Step Mania.

1280
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:14,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1281
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:18,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Beta 6, Release Candidate 3, better known as...

1282
01:29:19,285 --> 01:29:21,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Step Mania Version 3 Final.

1283
01:29:21,906 --> 01:29:24,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be going, hopefully it should be the final one.

1284
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:26,406
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fixes done there.

1285
01:29:26,426 --> 01:29:31,087
[SPEAKER_03]: That's available now from Sourceforge.com or whatever their site is.

1286
01:29:31,107 --> 01:29:32,767
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a link on DDR Maniacs.

1287
01:29:33,027 --> 01:29:33,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check that out.

1288
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:34,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be pretty good.

1289
01:29:35,128 --> 01:29:36,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it a little bit today.

1290
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:40,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a lot faster, so just go try that.

1291
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:43,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, DDR East Coast Invasion is back up.

1292
01:29:43,129 --> 01:29:47,610
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some server problems earlier this week and everyone thought they were gone for good, but they're back, so...

1293
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:49,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check them out.

1294
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Any new contests by them coming up?

1295
01:29:51,671 --> 01:29:57,833
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're doing right now one of the things, it's kind of like to get the most popular character in all the DDR games.

1296
01:29:58,193 --> 01:30:02,054
[SPEAKER_03]: They finished with the female characters and I believe, ah shit, I can't remember her name.

1297
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:02,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Alice?

1298
01:30:03,394 --> 01:30:03,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1299
01:30:04,114 --> 01:30:05,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Alice, I don't know, I just...

1300
01:30:06,495 --> 01:30:07,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just thinking, oh, Emmy.

1301
01:30:07,996 --> 01:30:08,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, Emmy.

1302
01:30:08,377 --> 01:30:09,337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, not Emmy.

1303
01:30:09,757 --> 01:30:10,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Alice, there's Alice.

1304
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:11,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Alice, yeah.

1305
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:11,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1306
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she won, so they're starting with... Big surprise, see.

1307
01:30:14,841 --> 01:30:17,062
[SPEAKER_16]: I could have told you that contest in two seconds, but that's all right.

1308
01:30:17,082 --> 01:30:17,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1309
01:30:17,943 --> 01:30:25,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, sim file-wise, supposedly there's a couple people working on making a Sakura DWI.

1310
01:30:26,269 --> 01:30:27,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, not really much going on.

1311
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,592
[SPEAKER_03]: My site coming up, but that's about it.

1312
01:30:31,614 --> 01:30:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be adding tons more content on there, so be looking for some more of that stuff later this week.

1313
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to fix a few files before I can put them on.

1314
01:30:39,403 --> 01:30:41,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, a couple things to state.

1315
01:30:41,825 --> 01:30:45,450
[SPEAKER_05]: First, on StepMania, the coolest thing is that you can speed up the speed of the song.

1316
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the coolest.

1317
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like how fast the arrows go, but the actual song.

1318
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:51,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think it's up to 1.5 times the actual speed now.

1319
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:52,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1320
01:30:52,775 --> 01:30:53,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.

1321
01:30:53,496 --> 01:30:58,579
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyways, um... Oh my gods, I can beat Max Unlimited S4R with two times speed!

1322
01:30:58,619 --> 01:30:59,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my gods, Dizzy!

1323
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:00,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

1324
01:31:00,741 --> 01:31:01,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1325
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:07,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, other than that, I mean, other than stuff we mentioned, you know, Feet of Fury, Beta's out, you know, um...

1326
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:10,388
[SPEAKER_03]: No updates for DWI, but I really don't care.

1327
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I've abandoned all hope for them, unfortunately.

1328
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:21,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I missed this, but were there any new released characters online for the... No, they're doing... Okay, there's number six.

1329
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:26,272
[SPEAKER_03]: He has two more people that I don't really care about because I don't play DDR PC anymore because it sucks.

1330
01:31:27,192 --> 01:31:32,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, there will be another character released next Friday, so they're doing them every two weeks now.

1331
01:31:32,794 --> 01:31:36,135
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed it's on my payday Friday, so there are at least two characters to see.

1332
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:37,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I really don't care.

1333
01:31:37,655 --> 01:31:41,696
[SPEAKER_03]: There are all these freaky, weird characters, and no one plays that game, so it really doesn't matter.

1334
01:31:42,516 --> 01:31:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, like I said, my site.

1335
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:52,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking, you know, maybe once I get things going a little bit, since DDR East Coast Evasion does their own tourney mixes, I might actually run one.

1336
01:31:53,398 --> 01:31:54,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually have prizes.

1337
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:57,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know me, in my edit contest, I had tons of prizes.

1338
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:58,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, oh yes.

1339
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And you'll be doing all those door prizes at Shaft.

1340
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'll clean out my prize closet there.

1341
01:32:03,505 --> 01:32:03,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Right on.

1342
01:32:03,925 --> 01:32:05,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're cleaning out your closet?

1343
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:07,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that, yeah.

1344
01:32:10,055 --> 01:32:10,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha, anyway.

1345
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and now DDR Max Extreme.

1346
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:15,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Max Extreme!

1347
01:32:15,883 --> 01:32:21,386
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing the testing started this Friday back there in Japan.

1348
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:23,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And people have been playing it.

1349
01:32:23,588 --> 01:32:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually a bunch of new songs have come out.

1350
01:32:25,929 --> 01:32:27,510
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple to mention.

1351
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,632
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a new Revenge song.

1352
01:32:29,772 --> 01:32:32,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all 16th and 32nd notes.

1353
01:32:33,174 --> 01:32:34,715
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's 60 beats per minute.

1354
01:32:35,276 --> 01:32:37,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 65 beats per minute, yeah.

1355
01:32:37,717 --> 01:32:39,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it called DDR Extreme?

1356
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:39,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1357
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:41,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Max Extreme?

1358
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:41,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1359
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1360
01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:43,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, bye.

1361
01:32:43,922 --> 01:32:44,402
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1362
01:32:44,422 --> 01:32:45,002
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme.

1363
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:45,563
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme.

1364
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:46,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's called Bag.

1365
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:48,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1366
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:49,326
[SPEAKER_03]: What a name for it.

1367
01:32:50,427 --> 01:32:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um... Big Asian groove.

1368
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: New Paranoia coming out.

1369
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:55,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Paranoia Survivor.

1370
01:32:55,969 --> 01:32:59,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um... It goes from 135 BPM to, like, 267... 270.

1371
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:05,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that should be pretty interesting.

1372
01:33:05,771 --> 01:33:07,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't there something that you have to do on that song?

1373
01:33:07,552 --> 01:33:10,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, you double A it and you can get an extra stage or something?

1374
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:10,493
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1375
01:33:11,073 --> 01:33:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no...

1376
01:33:12,142 --> 01:33:13,142
Legend of Max

1377
01:33:33,627 --> 01:33:38,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, supposedly if you double A Legend of Max, you get Sakura.

1378
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to point out, I was correct, and I called it a long time ago that Sakura is going to be the bonus song.

1379
01:33:43,935 --> 01:33:44,656
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the shit.

1380
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:46,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I know that.

1381
01:33:46,738 --> 01:33:54,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't really heard, I guess, if there's another extra stage, a different one, if there's Paranoia Survivor, if someone double A's that.

1382
01:33:56,249 --> 01:33:58,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time I hear that, I think of that Destiny's Child song.

1383
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it.

1384
01:34:01,654 --> 01:34:02,756
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, it's like this.

1385
01:34:02,816 --> 01:34:06,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You double, uh, parent a survivor, you get to vote somebody out of the arcade.

1386
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Or as 23rd Magus says, out-stomp, out-wink, out-dance.

1387
01:34:11,224 --> 01:34:11,885
[SPEAKER_16]: What's out-wink?

1388
01:34:12,846 --> 01:34:13,646
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1389
01:34:14,087 --> 01:34:15,348
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you wink when you play DDR?

1390
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:16,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Out-twink.

1391
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:17,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Out-twink?

1392
01:34:17,971 --> 01:34:19,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, twink, I don't know.

1393
01:34:22,999 --> 01:34:25,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard the word twink before, but it has absolutely nothing to do with DDR.

1394
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,100
[SPEAKER_16]: I guarantee you that.

1395
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to elaborate.

1396
01:34:28,501 --> 01:34:31,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, let's see if we can pull up the song list here.

1397
01:34:32,222 --> 01:34:33,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, yeah, I can pull you up the song list.

1398
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:43,505
[SPEAKER_16]: For those that don't know, one of the big people that gives us information on the Japanese location test is the guy known as Aaron in Japan.

1399
01:34:45,565 --> 01:34:47,406
[SPEAKER_16]: His website's over at aaroninjapan.com.

1400
01:34:48,692 --> 01:34:49,472
[SPEAKER_16]: WildSide IrresistibleMint

1401
01:35:13,258 --> 01:35:14,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that means.

1402
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:14,840
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid.

1403
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:19,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Speed Over Beethoven, which is, you know, on Speed 9, I believe.

1404
01:35:20,344 --> 01:35:21,024
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.

1405
01:35:21,745 --> 01:35:25,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's also We Are The Champions, a cover of that.

1406
01:35:26,109 --> 01:35:29,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the champions, my friends.

1407
01:35:30,252 --> 01:35:32,073
[SPEAKER_16]: And then We Will Rock You is also there.

1408
01:35:32,614 --> 01:35:34,475
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a Queenie mix.

1409
01:35:36,217 --> 01:35:36,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways.

1410
01:35:37,258 --> 01:35:38,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Big Gay DDR Extreme.

1411
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1412
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, we've got... Twink Revolution.

1413
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:44,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the older songs coming back.

1414
01:35:44,904 --> 01:35:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Damn Darium, Rhythm and Police, Synchronized Love, I Believe in Miracles, If You Were Here.

1415
01:35:49,966 --> 01:35:55,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a larger song list out there that has a lot more of the older rituals.

1416
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:57,891
[SPEAKER_16]: From what I understand, every Max 2 track is back.

1417
01:35:57,911 --> 01:36:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what somebody else was saying... Every Max 2 track and every Max 1 track is going to be back.

1418
01:36:02,473 --> 01:36:03,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Except for Telephone Operator, right?

1419
01:36:03,954 --> 01:36:06,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Telephone Operator and Follow Me are still gone, from what I heard, right?

1420
01:36:06,715 --> 01:36:11,137
[SPEAKER_16]: But Ghost is back, and all the good ones are back, except Telephone Operator.

1421
01:36:11,157 --> 01:36:11,958
[SPEAKER_16]: I love Telephone Operator.

1422
01:36:12,518 --> 01:36:14,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye Bye Baby Balloons back, much to our enjoyment.

1423
01:36:17,265 --> 01:36:23,013
[SPEAKER_16]: But from what I hear is that initially you don't see them on the list, that you have to sort your list a different way to see them.

1424
01:36:23,314 --> 01:36:24,015
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm hearing.

1425
01:36:25,849 --> 01:36:26,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you do that?

1426
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,031
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make sense.

1427
01:36:28,271 --> 01:36:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I think that it's a huge list.

1428
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:32,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you didn't see them right away.

1429
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:39,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're going to have an unlock system similar to Max 2, except it's going to be fewer points in between, a ton more unlocks instead.

1430
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:43,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have also, like before we've mentioned, the non-stop mode.

1431
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:47,463
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to actually have a Player's Best non-stop that you can play on there, which is kind of cool.

1432
01:36:47,823 --> 01:36:49,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be the top four songs.

1433
01:36:49,324 --> 01:36:52,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Arcadian can get out the pen and pencil again and start writing down Player's Best every week.

1434
01:36:52,806 --> 01:36:53,446
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty cool.

1435
01:36:53,546 --> 01:36:55,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember when Forthmix was out and he was writing them down every week.

1436
01:36:55,828 --> 01:36:58,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was like, Casey Kasem's Top 40 in the Player's Best.

1437
01:36:58,930 --> 01:36:59,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1438
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:00,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry I had to be here.

1439
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:02,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Inside joke, I guess.

1440
01:37:02,171 --> 01:37:07,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, you know, not to be any surprise at all, drop the bomb, the SystemFX mix.

1441
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:10,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, they couldn't stay U.S.

1442
01:37:10,523 --> 01:37:11,685
[SPEAKER_16]: exclusive for very long.

1443
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:15,108
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are still some... Oh, I'm sure you'll see the Dynamite Rave one on there, too.

1444
01:37:15,188 --> 01:37:16,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's going to be in there.

1445
01:37:16,589 --> 01:37:17,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So cold, so cold.

1446
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:20,112
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, So In Love, Kind Lady.

1447
01:37:20,192 --> 01:37:21,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't know those were going to be on there.

1448
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:23,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind Lady.

1449
01:37:23,636 --> 01:37:24,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song.

1450
01:37:24,617 --> 01:37:26,699
[SPEAKER_03]: V, of course, they said V was an 8-footer.

1451
01:37:27,879 --> 01:37:29,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Love, Love, Sugar, DJ Taka featuring Noria

1452
01:37:57,799 --> 01:38:06,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Lamor et Libierte, Kiss Kiss Kiss, Feeling of Love, Moba Moga, Frozen Ray, Miracle Moon, L.A.D.

1453
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:07,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Lifestyle, Destiny Lovers,

1454
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:22,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's the LED version.

1455
01:38:23,092 --> 01:38:24,713
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is too cool.

1456
01:38:24,773 --> 01:38:28,195
[SPEAKER_16]: From Mambo a Go-Go, Gamalande Couple is on there.

1457
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:28,975
[SPEAKER_16]: That rules.

1458
01:38:28,995 --> 01:38:30,756
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to have to play that.

1459
01:38:30,936 --> 01:38:33,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And not on this list right here, because this is an old list.

1460
01:38:34,819 --> 01:38:36,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet World is on there.

1461
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, very cool.

1462
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet World's on there.

1463
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:40,222
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1464
01:38:40,242 --> 01:38:41,143
[SPEAKER_03]: The steps could be cool.

1465
01:38:41,443 --> 01:38:43,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me scroll on down and see if I see some other stuff.

1466
01:38:43,344 --> 01:38:43,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1467
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:45,748
[SPEAKER_16]: A, Colors, at least 100 seconds

1468
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:07,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

1469
01:39:07,771 --> 01:39:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

1470
01:39:30,261 --> 01:39:31,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1471
01:39:32,182 --> 01:39:32,562
[SPEAKER_03]: 230 songs.

1472
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:33,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to be in it.

1473
01:39:33,702 --> 01:39:34,122
[SPEAKER_03]: My final.

1474
01:39:34,663 --> 01:39:35,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But the test is only, what, 50% done?

1475
01:39:35,943 --> 01:39:36,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that?

1476
01:39:37,123 --> 01:39:37,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.

1477
01:39:38,684 --> 01:39:41,085
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't know when it was going to be released.

1478
01:39:41,285 --> 01:39:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard rumors of end of the year, early spring.

1479
01:39:44,886 --> 01:39:48,227
[SPEAKER_16]: We've heard late December and early January.

1480
01:39:48,527 --> 01:39:48,787
Yeah.

1481
01:39:49,988 --> 01:39:50,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

1482
01:39:51,328 --> 01:39:52,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in time for New Year's Eve.

1483
01:39:52,728 --> 01:39:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, man.

1484
01:39:53,249 --> 01:39:54,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it this way.

1485
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:57,825
[SPEAKER_03]: That machine right there will definitely own.

1486
01:39:58,026 --> 01:39:59,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no doubt about it.

1487
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:00,610
[SPEAKER_03]: 230 songs.

1488
01:40:01,071 --> 01:40:03,616
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, how soon before it breaks in our local golf land?

1489
01:40:04,497 --> 01:40:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Golf land, man.

1490
01:40:05,659 --> 01:40:06,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be Scandia, man.

1491
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:18,976
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also another report, Aaron in Japan mentions that Shine was AAA'd on Heavy within two hours by one of those insane Japanese dancers, Yosaku.

1492
01:40:19,076 --> 01:40:26,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we don't want to obviously reveal to any Konami people that someone got pictures from the test location, but someone did get pictures from the test location.

1493
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:30,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone that's a website we might be looking at right now.

1494
01:40:30,842 --> 01:40:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And supposedly they should be leaked out a couple weeks from now.

1495
01:40:36,144 --> 01:40:36,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

1496
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:37,985
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to look for that.

1497
01:40:38,085 --> 01:40:40,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know if it's going to reveal anything.

1498
01:40:40,126 --> 01:40:40,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

1499
01:40:40,606 --> 01:40:41,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

1500
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:43,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably it's just going to be more kind of screenshots.

1501
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:44,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I like those.

1502
01:40:44,407 --> 01:40:47,128
[SPEAKER_16]: When Max 2 was first out, they got a lot of up-close screenshots.

1503
01:40:47,148 --> 01:40:47,768
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty cool.

1504
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:48,989
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm waiting for those kind of shots.

1505
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:51,090
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that have access to them.

1506
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:56,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have access to them because I'm not on that board, and I don't know Aaron, so obviously I can't get access to them.

1507
01:40:56,352 --> 01:40:56,932
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't passed.

1508
01:40:56,952 --> 01:41:01,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're protected, so there's no way for us to get him, unfortunately.

1509
01:41:01,634 --> 01:41:05,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what else is here, if there's any other exciting news to share.

1510
01:41:05,915 --> 01:41:10,796
[SPEAKER_03]: No new upgrade for the cabinet as posted a long time ago on Team Boilo.

1511
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:12,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same software.

1512
01:41:12,716 --> 01:41:13,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be an easy upgrade.

1513
01:41:14,216 --> 01:41:16,997
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying that Speed Over Beethoven is the best new song.

1514
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,977
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people are saying that.

1515
01:41:19,257 --> 01:41:20,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to see if I can get that.

1516
01:41:20,277 --> 01:41:21,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can get that from one of the... I've heard it.

1517
01:41:22,138 --> 01:41:24,318
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... I can't remember.

1518
01:41:24,358 --> 01:41:25,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not good at classic music.

1519
01:41:25,358 --> 01:41:26,259
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Speed 9, isn't it?

1520
01:41:26,959 --> 01:41:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Speed 9.

1521
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:30,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on that one song.

1522
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:33,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... I can't remember.

1523
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:33,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one...

1524
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:49,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can get that for you guys and play it next week.

1525
01:41:50,363 --> 01:41:51,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I know somebody who has Speed 9.

1526
01:41:51,524 --> 01:41:52,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get a copy of that.

1527
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:54,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we'll play that for you guys next week.

1528
01:41:54,606 --> 01:41:55,267
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have it right now.

1529
01:41:55,327 --> 01:41:55,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, guys.

1530
01:41:56,588 --> 01:41:58,349
[SPEAKER_16]: If somebody in the chat room has it, feel free to send it to me.

1531
01:41:58,369 --> 01:41:59,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll play it before the end of the show.

1532
01:42:01,203 --> 01:42:08,527
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much all that's up with DDR Extreme, other than the very girly shot picture of Naoki.

1533
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:10,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They have pictures from test location.

1534
01:42:10,808 --> 01:42:12,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Naoki's diary.

1535
01:42:12,069 --> 01:42:13,490
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't talked about Naoki's diary.

1536
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:14,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a filler.

1537
01:42:15,111 --> 01:42:15,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a filler.

1538
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:17,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nothing new.

1539
01:42:17,472 --> 01:42:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It was him bitching about more songs we don't really care about, and it was also talking about... Wow, wow, my life is so traumatic.

1540
01:42:23,735 --> 01:42:30,079
[SPEAKER_03]: They were interviewing some people that were working on it and asking him stupid questions like, what's your favorite character in...

1541
01:42:30,959 --> 01:42:32,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Like our listless.

1542
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, stupid things can only be done on this show.

1543
01:42:38,063 --> 01:42:46,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Listen up.

1544
01:42:46,888 --> 01:42:50,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to wrap up this show.

1545
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:52,311
[SPEAKER_16]: How's that sound?

1546
01:42:55,519 --> 01:42:56,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you said wrapping.

1547
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:57,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

1548
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:58,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That was terrible, right?

1549
01:42:59,001 --> 01:42:59,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it was.

1550
01:43:01,002 --> 01:43:02,343
[SPEAKER_16]: What shall we play in this break?

1551
01:43:02,403 --> 01:43:07,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's start off with... You want to hear Miracle Moon?

1552
01:43:09,067 --> 01:43:10,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let's hear Miracle Moon.

1553
01:43:10,568 --> 01:43:10,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair enough.

1554
01:43:11,549 --> 01:43:13,190
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1555
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:14,711
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be right back to wrap up the show.

1556
01:46:35,379 --> 01:46:39,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, as promised, we were able to get a copy of that Speed Over Beethoven song.

1557
01:46:39,623 --> 01:46:42,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much to DDR Mike for sending that to me.

1558
01:46:42,645 --> 01:46:43,786
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to play it for you right now.

1559
01:46:43,846 --> 01:46:45,327
[SPEAKER_16]: This is going to be a DDR Extreme.

1560
01:46:45,347 --> 01:46:46,588
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be an edited down version.

1561
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:48,570
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the full version, though, so you guys can get a sample of it.

1562
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:51,152
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Rose with Speed Over Beethoven.

1563
01:46:53,013 --> 01:46:55,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Speed Over Beethoven

1564
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I need you one again, I can't leave with music on to save your life It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over

1565
01:48:35,117 --> 01:48:56,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Lalalala, lalalalala Into the night, you make me cry I need your love, to save my life I need you wanna get on and play with Listen to the song and our melody It sets you free You need your love, to save your life I need you wanna get on and play with You gotta save your life Into the night, you make me cry I need your love, to save my life

1566
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:20,542
Music on a figure

1567
01:49:50,325 --> 01:49:58,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

1568
01:49:58,907 --> 01:50:06,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1569
01:50:06,048 --> 01:50:12,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We apologize for the awkward end there to that Speed Over Beethoven song, but that was right out of a non-stop, the Speed 9 album.

1570
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't have time to edit that together, because that just got sent to me.

1571
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:17,211
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we hope you enjoyed that, though.

1572
01:50:17,231 --> 01:50:18,111
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a pretty cool song.

1573
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:18,811
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you guys think of that?

1574
01:50:18,931 --> 01:50:19,091
[SPEAKER_16]: It was...

1575
01:50:19,831 --> 01:50:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I kind of like that a little more than Beethoven's Virus even, a little bit, just a little bit.

1576
01:50:47,634 --> 01:50:50,917
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have fooled me that it was a Jimmy Ronson.

1577
01:50:52,638 --> 01:50:54,700
[SPEAKER_16]: So what was that call that was more important than the show, Brad?

1578
01:50:56,141 --> 01:50:56,622
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

1579
01:50:56,642 --> 01:50:57,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

1580
01:50:58,263 --> 01:50:58,603
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

1581
01:50:58,623 --> 01:51:00,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I just thought I'd put you on the spot.

1582
01:51:00,725 --> 01:51:02,607
[SPEAKER_16]: We're winding down the end of the show here.

1583
01:51:04,508 --> 01:51:04,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1584
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:06,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

1585
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:08,752
[SPEAKER_16]: I see you want to have a conversation this year while I try to do the show in this year.

1586
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:09,152
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

1587
01:51:09,192 --> 01:51:09,552
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

1588
01:51:09,612 --> 01:51:09,993
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do that.

1589
01:51:11,396 --> 01:51:14,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, anything else you guys wanted to get out of your systems before the show was done?

1590
01:51:15,197 --> 01:51:15,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

1591
01:51:16,617 --> 01:51:17,938
[SPEAKER_16]: No, there's no other things you guys want to talk about?

1592
01:51:19,318 --> 01:51:22,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about... Sex.

1593
01:51:24,339 --> 01:51:24,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1594
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:28,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene said it, but it kind of didn't get picked up on the mic.

1595
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:30,361
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you like to talk about sex, Irene?

1596
01:51:31,661 --> 01:51:32,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1597
01:51:37,822 --> 01:51:37,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

1598
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:38,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

1599
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

1600
01:51:43,892 --> 01:51:45,934
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't relate sex to the money in any way?

1601
01:51:46,974 --> 01:51:48,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Outside of erotic songs?

1602
01:51:49,396 --> 01:51:50,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure you can.

1603
01:51:50,917 --> 01:51:57,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, like, they should, you know, how you were saying about the announcer, you know, relating it to, like, a guy jizzing or whatever.

1604
01:51:57,142 --> 01:52:01,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you fail a song, you should say, oh, well, premature ejaculation happens.

1605
01:52:02,526 --> 01:52:04,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be funny if the announcers had that.

1606
01:52:04,987 --> 01:52:06,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, there you go.

1607
01:52:06,689 --> 01:52:07,129
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.

1608
01:52:07,169 --> 01:52:08,230
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the money shot.

1609
01:52:11,625 --> 01:52:11,825
69 Combo!

1610
01:52:11,845 --> 01:52:12,526
Oh yeah!

1611
01:52:38,101 --> 01:52:42,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like that Saturday Night Live sketch where they had herbal essences for men.

1612
01:52:42,884 --> 01:52:51,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were like, they were doing the organs like, You know, because you know how, yeah, okay.

1613
01:52:53,492 --> 01:52:55,714
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't know how.

1614
01:53:00,737 --> 01:53:03,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Boy, this show went right down the toilet real fast, didn't it?

1615
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:24,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, right, when we said, uh, this is Orange Lounge Radio, uh... Let's see, to the latest, greatest, uh... Yeah, anyways... He said... Rob, Rob said... Rob said that's what it should say when you get a 69 combo.

1616
01:53:31,733 --> 01:53:34,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.

1617
01:53:35,996 --> 01:53:37,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, you watched Silence of the Lambs today?

1618
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:38,738
[SPEAKER_16]: What'd you think?

1619
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:40,479
[SPEAKER_07]: They were scary and good.

1620
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you never see them before?

1621
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw them when I was like 10, but I don't remember what happened.

1622
01:53:47,705 --> 01:53:48,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1623
01:53:49,846 --> 01:53:51,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and saw that Rules of Attraction.

1624
01:53:52,388 --> 01:53:53,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, how was that?

1625
01:53:53,088 --> 01:53:55,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear there's some pretty scandalous stuff in that.

1626
01:53:56,578 --> 01:53:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, not really.

1627
01:53:57,799 --> 01:53:59,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not too bad.

1628
01:53:59,421 --> 01:54:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty, it's a stylish film, I would say.

1629
01:54:02,183 --> 01:54:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, a lot of stuff that's, like, backwards and weird shit going on there.

1630
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:06,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1631
01:54:06,847 --> 01:54:12,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it starts in, you know, it's one of those movies that starts in the middle of the movie and then goes back and then comes to the middle again and then goes forward.

1632
01:54:14,172 --> 01:54:17,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I saw, uh, The Transporter on, I think, Saturday.

1633
01:54:18,035 --> 01:54:18,796
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty good.

1634
01:54:19,697 --> 01:54:19,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1635
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:20,820
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1636
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:24,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I won't spoil it, but it's like the guy there is like the master pimp of everything.

1637
01:54:24,964 --> 01:54:27,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard that that movie was a piece of shit, but that was just what I heard.

1638
01:54:28,387 --> 01:54:29,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did you hear it from?

1639
01:54:29,368 --> 01:54:31,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard the radio show was a piece of... No, I'm kidding.

1640
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:32,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Spirited Away.

1641
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:37,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say, you guys went and saw Spirited Away, and that's of interest to a lot of DDR people.

1642
01:54:37,354 --> 01:54:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on!

1643
01:54:38,195 --> 01:54:40,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You said... Hold on what?

1644
01:54:40,177 --> 01:54:44,941
[SPEAKER_16]: You like Showgirls, Rob, so... But I like Showgirls for its comic value.

1645
01:54:45,261 --> 01:54:47,603
[SPEAKER_16]: There is much comic value to be having Showgirls.

1646
01:54:47,883 --> 01:54:48,344
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

1647
01:54:48,945 --> 01:54:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny on TV where they tried to censor all the boobies.

1648
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:54,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the VH... Yes, you have to see Showgirls on VH1.

1649
01:54:54,768 --> 01:55:00,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't see Showgirls for the first time on VH1, but watch it for the second time on VH1 where they have to... Follow your Showgirls DVD?

1650
01:55:00,612 --> 01:55:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure can, honey.

1651
01:55:01,813 --> 01:55:02,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You ruin the effect of the insult.

1652
01:55:02,893 --> 01:55:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can, darling.

1653
01:55:07,173 --> 01:55:08,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes, tell us about Spirited Away.

1654
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:11,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, was the dub as crappy as the sub?

1655
01:55:11,174 --> 01:55:11,854
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to know.

1656
01:55:12,014 --> 01:55:14,255
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, was it crappier than the sub?

1657
01:55:14,275 --> 01:55:14,595
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1658
01:55:14,815 --> 01:55:15,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Spirited Away was a great movie.

1659
01:55:15,735 --> 01:55:17,095
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to know if they fucked up the dub.

1660
01:55:17,416 --> 01:55:27,178
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, the dub... Okay, I personally, I used to... When Princess Mononoke came out here, you know, in America, and I went and saw it in the theaters...

1661
01:55:28,263 --> 01:55:32,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying, and a lot of people were saying, that it was the greatest dub so far.

1662
01:55:32,485 --> 01:55:33,545
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing as good.

1663
01:55:33,745 --> 01:55:34,966
[SPEAKER_04]: This, in my opinion, is better.

1664
01:55:35,226 --> 01:55:37,006
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no annoying Claire Danes.

1665
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, seriously, the dub is great.

1666
01:55:40,448 --> 01:55:41,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody does a great job.

1667
01:55:41,568 --> 01:55:43,189
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no overacting in it at all.

1668
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:46,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't change anything.

1669
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't need to be changed.

1670
01:55:47,891 --> 01:55:50,112
[SPEAKER_04]: The names are pretty much all the same.

1671
01:55:50,632 --> 01:55:56,154
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a couple jokes thrown in that weren't in the original, but they were funny, and they made, you know...

1672
01:55:57,099 --> 01:55:58,599
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't ruin anything.

1673
01:55:58,619 --> 01:55:59,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.

1674
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should really go see that movie.

1675
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It was excellent.

1676
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the sub-version.

1677
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:04,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It was excellent.

1678
01:56:04,841 --> 01:56:05,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1679
01:56:05,461 --> 01:56:05,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1680
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:07,102
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the best films I've seen.

1681
01:56:07,122 --> 01:56:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And Disney did not make it, for all you people who don't know.

1682
01:56:10,622 --> 01:56:16,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people listening will know, but I have this feeling a lot of the parents in the theater were like, Disney, it's a Disney movie, yeah.

1683
01:56:17,164 --> 01:56:19,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Studio Ghibli and all that stuff.

1684
01:56:19,945 --> 01:56:21,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking to myself now.

1685
01:56:21,525 --> 01:56:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

1686
01:56:22,045 --> 01:56:23,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Miyazaki who made the movie.

1687
01:56:23,846 --> 01:56:24,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he was trying to say.

1688
01:56:26,110 --> 01:56:29,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I also saw part of Initial D, the anime series, after playing the game.

1689
01:56:30,173 --> 01:56:31,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that anime rocks.

1690
01:56:33,235 --> 01:56:34,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, and welcome to Last Week.

1691
01:56:34,455 --> 01:56:35,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

1692
01:56:35,496 --> 01:56:36,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to mention something.

1693
01:56:36,457 --> 01:56:38,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's video game related.

1694
01:56:38,798 --> 01:56:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard that they're making a sequel to Final Fantasy X, which is pretty interesting.

1695
01:56:44,601 --> 01:56:47,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now, from what I hear... From what I hear...

1696
01:56:48,599 --> 01:56:56,122
[SPEAKER_16]: In the US, those two sequels that they're making to Final Fantasy X, there's a Yuna story and there's a Riku.

1697
01:56:56,462 --> 01:56:57,923
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a Yuna story and a Riku story.

1698
01:56:58,303 --> 01:57:01,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And in Japan, those are going to be released as separate games, FF10, 1 and 2.

1699
01:57:01,724 --> 01:57:03,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And please keep in mind, my word is not gospel.

1700
01:57:03,885 --> 01:57:05,606
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just spreading dirty rumors I've heard.

1701
01:57:05,726 --> 01:57:07,367
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I'm wrong, then whatever.

1702
01:57:07,407 --> 01:57:08,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen screenshots.

1703
01:57:08,247 --> 01:57:09,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, no, no.

1704
01:57:09,128 --> 01:57:10,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they exist, but this is the thing.

1705
01:57:10,508 --> 01:57:10,928
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the thing.

1706
01:57:11,188 --> 01:57:17,111
[SPEAKER_16]: You know how Final Fantasy XI, it's online in Japan, and it's kind of been a bit of a wreck because they've had a lot of problems with the servers.

1707
01:57:19,203 --> 01:57:24,207
[SPEAKER_16]: They won't release the hard drives here in America, so there's really no way they're going to be able to release Final Fantasy XI in America.

1708
01:57:24,668 --> 01:57:28,771
[SPEAKER_16]: And playing online games in America is kind of... I don't know.

1709
01:57:28,811 --> 01:57:34,175
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know any online game I've ever seen that people take it seriously, except EverQuest, which is where people take it way too seriously.

1710
01:57:34,636 --> 01:57:37,898
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think Final Fantasy Online in America would kind of be stupid anyway.

1711
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:39,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultima Online.

1712
01:57:39,219 --> 01:57:46,205
[SPEAKER_16]: But what's going to happen, since they can't do it on the PlayStation 2 because they have no hard drive, they're going to release it on the computer as Final Fantasy Online.

1713
01:57:46,665 --> 01:57:50,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy XI here in America is going to be those side stories.

1714
01:57:50,046 --> 01:57:51,787
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to release them as one game here in America.

1715
01:57:52,047 --> 01:57:52,927
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just what I've heard.

1716
01:57:53,167 --> 01:57:58,249
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's really strange about it is Yuna looks like freaking Lara Croft.

1717
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:03,751
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got two pistols and I don't know, it's just weird.

1718
01:58:05,009 --> 01:58:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: She's carrying forbidden machina?

1719
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,350
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?

1720
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:08,731
[SPEAKER_03]: She's violating the teachings.

1721
01:58:09,952 --> 01:58:13,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she said screw the teachings in Final Fantasy X in the first place.

1722
01:58:13,373 --> 01:58:17,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And that and supposedly machina has taken over... Spoiler free show, please.

1723
01:58:17,055 --> 01:58:17,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Spoiler free show.

1724
01:58:17,836 --> 01:58:19,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't really played through X. Come on.

1725
01:58:20,017 --> 01:58:20,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1726
01:58:21,438 --> 01:58:22,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, yeah, exactly.

1727
01:58:22,898 --> 01:58:23,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1728
01:58:23,339 --> 01:58:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this machina taking over Spira is after X anyway, so it has nothing to do with X.

1729
01:58:32,142 --> 01:58:34,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Spoiler free show plays that includes you people in the chat room.

1730
01:58:34,904 --> 01:58:37,126
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn, so not everybody's finished the game yet.

1731
01:58:37,407 --> 01:58:39,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of us are just now getting our US PS2.

1732
01:58:39,929 --> 01:58:44,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us wasted all their money buying a Japanese PS2 and can't afford to get an American one.

1733
01:58:44,172 --> 01:58:48,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and those people play 2DX, so they suck.

1734
01:58:50,918 --> 01:58:51,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know me.

1735
01:58:51,739 --> 01:58:52,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down.

1736
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:53,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to the hand.

1737
01:58:54,901 --> 01:58:55,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting.

1738
01:58:57,564 --> 01:58:57,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1739
01:58:57,824 --> 01:58:57,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1740
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:07,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, other than that, there's also, supposedly they're selling now a, um, international PS2.

1741
01:59:07,816 --> 01:59:09,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Plays both US and Japanese games.

1742
01:59:10,638 --> 01:59:10,978
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1743
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that.

1744
01:59:12,019 --> 01:59:13,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's on YesAsia.

1745
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no, that, you know what, it's tricky, I saw that, it's just the way they worded it.

1746
01:59:17,103 --> 01:59:23,147
[SPEAKER_16]: We go back and read it very carefully, it's not, it's not an all-region DVD, they just try to make it sound like that, so.

1747
01:59:23,968 --> 01:59:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1748
01:59:24,588 --> 01:59:24,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1749
01:59:25,629 --> 01:59:27,731
[SPEAKER_16]: If I'm wrong, then, fuck em'.

1750
01:59:28,669 --> 01:59:29,890
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we're running a little over.

1751
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:31,450
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to finish up the last show.

1752
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:31,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Final thoughts.

1753
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:33,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Any final thoughts from you, Loki?

1754
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out my site if you haven't yet.

1755
01:59:35,372 --> 01:59:41,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.leachfromloki.tk All right, any final thoughts from Dave?

1756
01:59:43,496 --> 01:59:46,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Go watch Initial D. It is cool.

1757
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:48,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Any final thoughts from Brad?

1758
01:59:48,838 --> 01:59:49,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't done?

1759
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:50,559
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1760
01:59:51,459 --> 01:59:53,540
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is that I am done now.

1761
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1762
01:59:55,221 --> 01:59:55,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass it on.

1763
01:59:57,958 --> 01:59:59,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Any final thoughts from you, Mr. Brad?

1764
01:59:59,782 --> 02:00:03,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.

1765
02:00:05,094 --> 02:00:05,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thank you.

1766
02:00:05,675 --> 02:00:06,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Any final thoughts from you, Irene?

1767
02:00:07,639 --> 02:00:08,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1768
02:00:08,789 --> 02:00:09,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye, that's it?

1769
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:11,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, fair enough.

1770
02:00:34,601 --> 02:00:39,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Every track that I've got, which is everything, except for, I don't think I have all the eighths, but I've got just about everything.

1771
02:00:39,987 --> 02:00:44,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to play 2DX music all night long until I feel like shutting it off, which will be a couple hours.

1772
02:00:44,452 --> 02:00:47,095
[SPEAKER_16]: So enjoy that, you guys.

1773
02:00:47,195 --> 02:00:47,555
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

1774
02:00:47,575 --> 02:00:48,656
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I've got to say for now.

1775
02:00:48,776 --> 02:00:49,858
[SPEAKER_16]: So good night, everybody.

1776
