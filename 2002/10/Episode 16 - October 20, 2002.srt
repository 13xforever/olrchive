The galaxy is at peace.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One...

Thirty-seven! My girlfriend sucks thirty-seven dicks!

In a row?

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Shh! And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are the weakest thing to bite.

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000

Skye.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

Everything alright?

Without love

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Never go to the place I'm from and it's

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
And I'm DJ and they start rockin' it

100

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Let me focus in my mind

109
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Cause I know they're running me

110
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Without love

111
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Where would you be right now?

112
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100

It takes us deep, but then

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
I went for a run from now.

122
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
But it still felt so good and hard

123
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100

124
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100

Leave a running cold mess, serving, drinking a train

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
To the next station, on the dancehall

136
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
A rock of the nation

137
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
The sound, it's coming out now

138
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
For DJ, looking so loud

139
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Dancin', I make the body laugh

140
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Blooddrain, water in the wall top

141
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Like a fist, I keep on turnin'

142
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Like a fire, I keep on burnin'

143
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I live, dance around in a place

144
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:41,800
Beach and Wife, the pretty f

145
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,800
the

146
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
the

147
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,800
the

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
the

149
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,800
the

150
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,800
.

151
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,800
.

152
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,800
.

153
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
.

154
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800
.

155
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

156
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Orange Lounge Radio

157
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,960
We're going to have the ketchup song because we have the Macarena in the first one.

158
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, happy day.

159
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,520
My thoughts exactly.

160
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,640
I want to take a minute at the very top of the show here to recognize my other show that

161
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,000
I've been participating in for the last 20 months, undersedationalive.org.

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
And for those that didn't hear, the show came to an end, I believe two weeks ago was the

163
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,040
last show because Live 365 was off this past week and unfortunately there were some circumstances

164
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,280
that developed which caused our program to go off of air, but, you know, people sometimes

165
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,760
have to go off to pursue better opportunities, and that's what our main host of that show

166
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
had to do.

167
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,080
So I just wanted to give a big thanks to everybody involved with that program, understationlive.org,

168
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,880
for the past 20 months, it was a fun time, and without that background coming into this,

169
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,460
I don't think this show would exist.

170
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,340
So if you guys have a moment when you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go check out the

171
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,560
understationlive archives, they're still up and running, and who knows, Travis the main

172
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,720
host over there might be doing a big revival when he's over, he's out there in Texas, he

173
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,880
moved out to Texas, he might do something with some new co-hosts and I definitely would

174
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,460
support him in doing something like that. So, big thanks to everybody at understationlive.org.

175
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,360
Now back to Orange Lounge Radio, here we are, we're back from break last week, we were also

176
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,580
breaking last week, breaking what, I don't know. Oh, breaking all time low listening

177
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:30,580
records for our tape show, that's for sure. No, actually, it was fine. What did you think

178
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,300
of that show, Brad? It was interesting, wasn't it?

179
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,380
Did you hear the show? Yeah, I had to dump the whole tape and edit

180
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,220
it together. I heard the show. It was... We always tend to get a very mixed reaction

181
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,940
from the chat room when we do those tapes. That was the second time we taped a show in

182
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,340
advance. So that one was the one from Scandio?

183
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,940
That was the Scandio one we taped a couple weeks ago.

184
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,820
My opinion is the Golf Land one was better. Because you were on it, right?

185
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,940
no i was not you know you are on the call for a while

186
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,060
those that

187
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,020
uh...

188
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,460
no uh...

189
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,460
it was better because when the person when you went downstairs to play hip-hop

190
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,860
many that's true and the person was like what are you doing here that's real

191
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,720
project and that you know uh... teeth

192
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,260
keep the wonderful of our key technician over a scandia that's uh... who can

193
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,460
replace up to the exit style of week

194
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,240
sent to a channel b

195
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,220
can cooperate

196
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,780
uh...

197
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,400
He was totally cool what was going on so he knew nothing like that was gonna happen now

198
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,660
I should have staged something like that. That would've been good radio, huh? Getting something like that staged

199
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,600
Maybe I could have had Jamie, you know change her voice a little bit and come out going. Hey you guys

200
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Yeah, gee

201
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Speaking of Jamie if you missed the opening of the show, she's not gonna be with us tonight

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,280
Actually, we're not sure she might show up for the last half of the show, but she's on the road right now

203
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,320
She's come back from Frisco. She's gonna be going to the big yaoi con

204
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,440
You guys would appreciate this, I mentioned this at the top of the show, we got more people

205
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
that just joined us.

206
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
They would not appreciate it, yeah.

207
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,880
I don't know, but you'd appreciate this little sense of humor.

208
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,460
Would you, Irene, I think you'd be the best person here to explain to our listening audience

209
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,520
what exactly yaoi is.

210
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,760
Isn't it basically like, gay anime, like male gay anime with pretty boys?

211
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Fair enough.

212
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,200
Oh, Loki wants to contribute something.

213
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,080
I thought it was gay anime porn, from what I've heard.

214
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,800
From what I understand, it's not really porn, it's all implied.

215
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,720
It's all like implied porn, you know?

216
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,320
I don't know how you imply porno, but just, like a, like a Skinimax film.

217
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
It's like a, it's like a gay Skinimax film, but it's animated in a Japanese style.

218
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Huh?

219
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,080
I'm glad that I never heard of this before.

220
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,800
Anyway, so I don't even know if she made it to YowieCon.

221
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,760
I think they ended up just going to Frisco, but I did hear this joke from Tal, one of

222
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,900
our, he's been here, I guess, before.

223
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,400
his girlfriend, big yaoi fan. Big yaoi fan. And she was at the con and one of my friends

224
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,920
was dropping her off, mentioned that, oh yeah, at the yaoi con, on one side of the hotel,

225
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,260
they're doing the yaoi con, the other side of the hotel looks like they're doing the

226
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Church of Christ Youth Ministry Convention. It's not a joke, this is for real.

227
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Oh, you're serious? Yes, I'm serious. That was like the very first time I ever played

228
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,360
was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention.

229
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Irene was there.

230
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Irene was there.

231
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Irene knows about this.

232
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Okay.

233
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
I have to tell you about the actual convention the first day.

234
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,160
It was Rocky Horror picture in one door and right next door, the gun show.

235
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
The gun show.

236
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
With a bunch of hicks and they hated Asian people and I was so scared.

237
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,660
I was like, oh my God, I'm going to die.

238
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,120
It was a bunch of cart carrying NRA members mixed in with guys dressed in drag doing the

239
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
whole Frank-N-Furter thing.

240
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,240
If you've ever seen Rocky Horror, you know what I'm talking about.

241
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,920
If you haven't, you should.

242
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
It's fun.

243
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:45,920
where you been? Where you been? Wake up! Go outside! Stop playing DDR! Put the controller down!

244
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,640
You know one thing that Travis, the host over at understationlive.org recommended to me

245
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,360
was that

246
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,080
we should take, now that that show is going to be gone, we should take some of that and

247
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
bring it to

248
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,960
Orange Lounge and just get really random on that show. Because you know Under Station Live was supposed to be

249
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,140
a Rocky Horror show, and in the beginning it was. It was just like We Are With Bomani.

250
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:19,500
I was going to say, wasn't that show number two?

251
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
What?

252
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Where it all turned to hell?

253
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh yeah, I still got it.

254
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,140
Even show number one was kind of...

255
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Remember when we had this...

256
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,580
You know it's funny that we're reminiscing about something that just happened three months

257
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
ago or...

258
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Where are we?

259
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Episode sixteen.

260
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
It was about four months ago.

261
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,020
Where we had those little headsets that sounded like shit.

262
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I felt like I was back in the call center, taking calls, you know?

263
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,020
Thank you for calling, how may I direct your call?

264
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,020
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio!

265
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:50,020
It's kind of, I guess the word would be ironic that we're talking about how sooner or later we'll get off topic,

266
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
and while we're talking about this, we're getting off topic!

267
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Ah, fuck DDR, it's old!

268
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
We had a topic?

269
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Yeah, we have the donuts, Rob.

270
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
You have to go get them!

271
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,120
up to something we've been talking about for weeks and weeks on the show. If you go over

272
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,240
to http://www.cagames.com, that stands for Cryptic Illusion Games, they've released a

273
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,320
new home-brewed Dreamcast game. And if you have a Dreamcast and you've got a CD burner,

274
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,760
then you should burn this. This is the Feet of Fury, which is this new release of a DDR

275
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,120
simulator. I'm not sure if you want to call it a simulator, a clone. It's not an emulator.

276
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,120
I always get criticized on this because I call things emulators to be simulated. What would you categorize this as, Louis?

277
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:32,120
It's just another game that's similar to DDR. It's basically like Dance Match Mode from Disney's Rave, and it just so happens to support the DWI format, sort of, because it doesn't have tempo changes, you know, tempo stops, free zeroes, or, you know, 12th notes, so it's kind of, you know, third mix down.

278
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,440
It's basically DDR first mix type level. I mean, the simulator hasn't quite progressed,

279
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,080
you know, obviously, to that level of being on the same caliber as DDR Max. It's an early

280
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,260
beta release. They're not done with everything they wanted to do yet. So it's an early beta

281
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,360
that got released, but you can download this. It's got about, what, seven songs on it that

282
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,340
you can play, all by the same guy, I notice, but that'll probably change with future versions.

283
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,960
There's some decent stuff in there. I'm going to play one of the songs from PETA Fury a

284
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,920
little later. So some good stuff. It's just like Dance Magic, as you said. It's kind of

285
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,640
like Street Fighter meets DDR, if you can imagine that, because you've got your characters

286
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,120
that you pick and all this stuff. But I know everybody got a chance to test it for the

287
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,920
show. I was just kind of wondering what you guys thought. I'll start. I know it's an early

288
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,320
beta. I think it's an early beta. It's damn impressive. I mean, it's kind of like what

289
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,800
I'd call a DDR-first mix. As far as DDR goes, it's got a long way to go to catch up. But

290
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,520
I mean, it's still a first release, it's early, but it looks good.

291
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,520
I mean, a lot of Dreamcast's homebrew and stuff isn't that great, but Feed of Fury is

292
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
coming along very nicely.

293
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,400
I love the idea that it's going to support your own stuff, your own DWIs and things.

294
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,860
I kind of wish there was a mode that wasn't Dance Magic, like you could play in like a

295
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,800
normal mode, but I kind of think that all that stuff is coming.

296
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,080
They just want to get the initial stuff out the gate and then they'll kind of add on to

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
it.

298
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,200
All that freeze arrows and 12th notes, they'll probably come onto it later, but they've got

299
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,760
to get their basic engine established first.

300
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
They're smart.

301
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Yeah.

302
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Yeah, if they're smart they'll do that.

303
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,480
But I think if you got a Dreamcast and a Burner, there's no reason you shouldn't be going and

304
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,760
downloading this right now and playing it.

305
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
It's pretty cool.

306
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Hold on.

307
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Yes, Brad?

308
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay, I understand it's a beta and all, and I guess this is a great start, there's some

309
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,560
possibilities and things with this, but who was the graphic designer on this thing, man?

310
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I have no idea.

311
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Some big Star Trek geek or something?

312
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,680
Because what are the arrows?

313
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,720
The arrows are the shape of...

314
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Are they?

315
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Is the arrow the shape of the normal arrows in DDR?

316
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Well, that's the thing, is that you don't want to copy DDR because they're probably afraid of a lawsuit.

317
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Well, you know what, though? That if you ever played True Kiss Destination DDR, those arrows look a hell of a lot like those arrows. I kind of noticed that.

318
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,600
Well, on the topic of those arrows, you know, it's nice to have different arrows, but you

319
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,360
can't tell the difference between, you know, the different notes.

320
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Like fourth notes, you know, eighth, sixteenth, it's, I mean, they have a slight color change

321
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,240
to them, but otherwise they're just looking like these shiny Star Trek symbols.

322
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Yeah.

323
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
Why don't we just make them big circles, all of them?

324
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
They can all be circles.

325
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
There you go.

326
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
And hopefully you tell them apart, they're different colors.

327
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,800
That would be easy to answer, so we can't do that.

328
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,800
No, but I think that as far as it goes, the actual playing quality, it's not that bad,

329
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,200
but the arrows, it's really weird, because one of the modifiers especially makes all

330
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,880
the arrows spin around in place, kind of like, I forget what it is on StepMania, do you know

331
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
what the...

332
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Dizzy.

333
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Dizzy mode, where all of them spin around while going up, even though they're in the

334
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,280
same column.

335
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,880
And with arrows that long, they kind of overlap, so you can't tell which note is which and

336
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
which...

337
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,440
Well, right, but I mean, it's not supposed to be easy.

338
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah, but it's not supposed to be impossible to read.

339
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,080
And also another thing I noticed is it's way too easy to get perfect.

340
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,240
That blink thing was the most annoying one, where like half the arrows would disappear

341
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,600
at a time, they'd fade in and out, you'd be able to see half of them, that was really

342
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
hard to see.

343
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,460
I didn't quite get how the gameplay of the game went. Of course, maybe that's my own

344
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,360
fault because I didn't read a manual, but hopefully they'll do a built-in tutorial later

345
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
on in the game.

346
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah, I don't think there's any story mode or anything. I mean, it didn't look like...

347
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Well, I don't know. Like, they're having Puzzle Tetris or whatever it's called.

348
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Puzzle Fighter?

349
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
No.

350
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
God.

351
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
What's a game?

352
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
God, shit.

353
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Puzzle Bobble?

354
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
No, it's on Super Nintendo.

355
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Bust a move?

356
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Final Fantasy?

357
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
No.

358
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Oh, God.

359
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh god, my mouth plays a ton.

360
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
First Avalanche?

361
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
No, it might hurt.

362
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
No, I don't think...

363
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
You like Yoshi, Tetris, or Yoshi?

364
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Ah, Yoshi's in heat?

365
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
No, dammit!

366
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
What is it?

367
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Forget it!

368
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Who cares?

369
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Dammit!

370
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
So basically you pick a character and they have different modifiers that they attack with or whatever.

371
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,400
So as you're going along you have a little bar that's kind of in the middle and as soon as that builds up you can do one of two things.

372
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Either you can set to auto where once it builds up all the way along you can unleash the attack.

373
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Or you can set to manual to where when it builds up you can attack whenever with a modifier or something.

374
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,400
That's nice. What I like to do during that is just punch my neighbor, whoever's playing against me.

375
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,320
I when it when it fills up or not whenever just whenever I feel like it that works. It's more effective. I

376
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't think they could hear you on the way it's it's for the best that they couldn't hear me

377
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
So yeah, that's pretty much what it is

378
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,640
Tetris attack

379
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Yes

380
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,960
How'd that feel when I smashed the ichophone against your hand? You know, I said Tetris attack earlier

381
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Or the uber awesome, and I'm sorry. Fuck all y'all, this game rules. Pokemon Puzzle League.

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Boo!

383
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Fuck you!

384
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Oh, you mean Yoshi's Cookie?

385
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,460
No! I mean Pokemon Puzzle League. It was never released on Super Nintendo. It doesn't

386
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,960
exist. It was always Pokemon. I swear.

387
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Yoshi's Cookie.

388
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Yoshi's Cookie.

389
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,960
So yeah, that's about it. That's all. I guess we'll have to wait a couple months and see

390
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,960
what they're going to come up with. Supposedly there's supposed to be a step editor and stuff.

391
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I haven't exactly tried to, uh...

392
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
What the hell are you doing?

393
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
We're, um...

394
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
No, we're doing Kentucky Fried Movie.

395
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Anyways...

396
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
For all our listeners, you can't see.

397
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
So, um...

398
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Yeah, they're supposed to add a step editor.

399
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
And I haven't tried to, actually, you know, make a swap CD,

400
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
but you can do that too, and...

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I don't know.

402
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm being told a few things by Twen in the chat room,

403
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,960
who was our, kind of, the person who alerted us to, uh...

404
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
this game in the first place,

405
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,960
saying that the creator has stated that a main mode will be in the final version

406
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,960
cool, that's good to hear, and not only will you be able to put in your own

407
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,960
DWIs and stuff, you'll be able to have your own graphic themes, so if you want to change the arrows

408
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,960
have, go to town. I wasn't waving, I was going like

409
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,960
way, yay, wow. I thought you were waving because you wanted to talk, I'm sorry.

410
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,960
But anyways.

411
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,960
What other kinds of modes would you be looking forward to, to see in a later version of

412
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't really know. That just means I have to buy Dreamcast pads now.

413
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Screw that, I'm just sticking with my PC.

414
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Actually, what I was planning to do since I'm, you know, like that, I was going to rip the songs out of that sim and put them on my sim, but you know, that's just me.

415
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Did you say rip?

416
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah, I said rip.

417
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,840
red

418
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720

419
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,820

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,100
want to hear the uh...

421
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,220
music that goes into it and this is uh... created by guy who did all the

422
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
songs in the first release of peter fear by the way

423
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,760

uh... this is my favorite in the cd looks like a giant happy face this

429
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,260
This happens to be my favorite song in the game.

430
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,380
This is Thyssenitis, and I'm going to play this for you guys so you can sample some of

431
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,380
music from Feed a Fury right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

432
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,380
the

433
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,980
all right if you just joining us that was uh... tyson itis from uh... feet of

434
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,260
fear i can't pronounce these ten asses hits and asses

435
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,340
tonight is they have a cream for that this is why I'm on the internet radio

436
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,380
and not normal radio as long along with the rest of you might I add I was from

437
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,260
feet of fury which is a brand new a Dreamcast DDR clone type game I don't

438
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:47,700
know what the official label of it would be but dance magic type things you guys

439
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,300
some very interesting comments were made during that a song in the room here

440
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,340
basically talking how much of an old-school video game that sounds like

441
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,980
is like level four of blaster master or something

442
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,140
in defense of blaster master it had better music than that

443
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,780
blaster master is a shit

444
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,660
irene i know you had some pretty uh...

445
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:13,220
some pretty interesting opinions so why don't you share with everyone else listening

446
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,340
oh man

447
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,760
my plumbing was clogged

448
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,380
anyway

449
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,720
uh... hold on

450
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,580
brad is the most immature person i know

451
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,340
and he's like four years older than you are.

452
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,020
Oh, um...

453
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,580
V to Fury, is that what it's called? Yes, V to Fury.

454
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,620
Why do you think it sucks? It's free! I don't care! But the best things in life are free! Yeah, well if you already have

455
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,660
like third mix, fourth mix, whatever on PlayStation, that's free.

456
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,620
You know, I mean, this is, it's already been done on Disney's Rave, and I think it's just kind of

457
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,940
cheesy, and like the music doesn't fit well, it doesn't dance.

458
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,380
I mean, I couldn't dance to it, and if I saw it, just, you know, I wouldn't want to, you know, get it or anything.

459
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Now, do you think if Loki performed some sexual favors over there and got some of his songs on the F.O.F., it might be a little better?

460
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,380
It might be a little better, but I still wouldn't play it.

461
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:11,380
I mean, I don't know, like, you know, not because of his music, but because the whole scheme of it just sucks.

462
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:18,380
I don't know, like, if he were to put his music, like, on a, you know, a max scheme or something like that, or Disney's Rave, yeah, sure, I'd play it.

463
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,380
So you just want to play a copy of DDR, basically, with new songs?

464
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,180
Well, not even just a copy, just DDR.

465
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,700
If you're going to even call this a knockoff of DDR, it's not very well done.

466
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
I don't know.

467
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,500
Even if it is preliminary, it kind of sucks.

468
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I don't like it.

469
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Fair enough.

470
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,180
You can't please everybody.

471
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
That's fine.

472
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,980
We're about a variety of opinion here on Orange Launch Radio.

473
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
You suck, Irene.

474
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
I hate you.

475
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,420
You can never please women.

476
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
That's right.

477
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
You can never please a woman like you.

478
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
No, you can't.

479
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,860
It's okay.

480
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,860
I don't need to.

481
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,860
You know, this Fetus Fury game needs to have, like, a one panel mode.

482
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
That'd be cool.

483
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
A one panel mode?

484
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Yeah!

485
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Yeah!

486
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
That'd be hard.

487
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,860
I couldn't do it.

488
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Too many arrows.

489
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,860
No, I think two panel would be better, because it's, like, just running.

490
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
It's like Dropout.

491
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Oh, I should just play Boom Boom Dollar.

492
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
That was over.

493
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Left, left, right, right, left, right, right.

494
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
Uh, well, let's see.

495
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,940
Let's just play, um, let's see, Mickey Mouse March from Disney's Rift.

496
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,860
That is left and right.

497
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,060
No. I don't know. I still, I still, I like

498
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,300
PETA FURIA. I mean, it's not something I'm gonna play every day. It's just kind of

499
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,640
something you look at and go,

500
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,900
yeah, it's pretty cool. I wonder what the next one's gonna look like, and... You can look at that.

501
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,620
Not me, because I'm not gonna play it. Well, you're a bitch.

502
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,300
I'm just kidding. Fuck you! You're gonna die.

503
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,740
You know I speak the truth. It's all good.

504
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,900
It's all good. You speak the truth, you're a bitch. Oh, thanks.

505
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,100
I love you, Eileen. You know that.

506
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,500
Ow! Now her bar got full and she punched me.

507
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Wow.

508
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,500
I suggest we're gonna take a quick break, because I need to go to potty and I've got

509
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,780
people yelling at me left

510
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,180
left and right to play the channel. Are you guys destroying things back there? What the

511
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,900
hell's going on?

512
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,340
Dave had a little too much to drink, so he's... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.

513
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Didn't you have a birthday recently, Dave, or am I confusing you with someone else?

514
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Who are you talking to, Rob?

515
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Did Dave leave?

516
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Yes.

517
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Oh, never mind.

518
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,340
That's why you have to look at the computer screen all the time.

519
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Get out of your house, Rob.

520
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Get off your tail and go.

521
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Great.

522
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Okay, I'm going to put on some songs.

523
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,340
We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back and we're going to talk about

524
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Dance Dance Revolution USA and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

571
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,300
I can barely hear, I'm sorry. I'm in a restaurant.

572
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Oh, okay. Um...

573
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,800

Well, what's going on? Tell...

00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,300
I'm sorry, listeners, but I needed food.

576
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,300
That's okay. You want to say anything to our listeners?

577
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
What?

578
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Do you want to say anything to our listeners?

579
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,300
I just wanted to make sure everything was going okay.

580
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Everything's going great.

581
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
You're cutting up on me.

582
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You want to say anything?

583
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,800
We've been talking about Feed a Fury. Have you played that yet?

584
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
I still can't hear you.

585
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
We've been talking about Feet of Fury, have you played that yet?

586
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
It's freaking up, I'm sorry, why don't I talk to you in a bit?

587
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,300
Alright, I'll talk to you later, Jamie.

588
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Bye.

589
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
Now you know why we can't take phone calls on this show.

590
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
Well, we need to patch it in an actual phone line.

591
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
Yeah, we need to patch it in an actual phone line.

592
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,300
And at some point we'll be able to take phone calls.

593
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,300
But that was my cell phone on the speakerphone.

594
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,300
And she couldn't hear me because I guess we get really shitty reception in this room here.

595
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,460
room here, so. Uh, Irene, you were telling a funny little story during the break, you

596
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,460
know what I'm talking about? I don't know what I'm talking about, man.

597
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,460
It's something for, it's orange on business. Oh, it's orange on old business.

598
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,820
See, and you were listening, but that's okay. That's fine.

599
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,620
I didn't think so, actually. Okay, so unfortunately it sounds like Jamie

600
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,020
and them stopped to eat, so I don't think there's any way in hell she's gonna make it

601
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,180
back in time, so. Maybe they're out dairy green running across

602
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,860
the street. Yeah, wouldn't that be funny? Why don't you

603
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,700
Tell her one where I live, Brad.

604
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,540
I'm sure he's in a thousand or a million fucking Dairy Queens.

605
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
Well, in Sacramento, there's only like, you know...

606
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,580
Fifty.

607
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,140
Just kidding, I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you, I don't care.

608
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,180
Yeah, so, Feed a Fury.

609
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,460
Any last thoughts on that?

610
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,060
I know you guys were saying some more during the break. No.

611
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,460
Just a quick reminder, if you are going to burn it, make sure you have the

612
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,540
newest copy of

613
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,180
Nero or whatever, the

614
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,520
burning software, because I burned one

615
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,920
with an older copy of Nero. I mean, not that old, but a little older, and it didn't work.

616
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,600
So, make sure you have the newest version of Nero.

617
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,960
From what I understand, they did release the next day. They released an updated version

618
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,600
of the burn that should work on older version Nero, because I have an old version of Nero

619
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,760
and I was able to get it with their re-released one, so.

620
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,240
Those bastards. They made me lose a CD.

621
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,520
Me too. I lost two of them. But if you want to check it out, form your own opinion on

622
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,800
the game, kind of got a mixed reaction here so far, check it out at http colon slash slash

623
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,400
www.cagames.com

624
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,440
So moving right along, I should plug our chat room.

625
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,020
We haven't plugged that at all tonight.

626
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,860
You're just going to join any other side IRC server,

627
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,580
like karma.othersideirc.net or irc.eggheads.org.

628
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,680
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

629
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
And that's the same server, by the way,

630
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
that hosts a lot of the other big Bimani sites.

631
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,460
So if you're in one of the Bimani chat rooms right now,

632
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,760
chances are you're on the same server as Orange Lounge.

633
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,960
Just type to join the channel orange lounge Brad waiting your clothes off. We're not ready for that point of the show yet

634
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,920
Anyway

635
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,120
Let's talk about I don't know. Let's talk about

636
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,920
How'd you guys week? It's been about two weeks since we've all been kind of sitting here together

637
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,120
How'd you guys week you do anything exciting any?

638
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,160
Bahmani news or novel on he is I don't care

639
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,440
I

640
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,400
I finished my site.

641
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,360
Oh yeah, tell everybody about your site.

642
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,280
Yes, yes, yes, my DDR site.

643
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,600
Thanks to Twin for registering a domain name

644
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,520
that kind of got me started on actually finishing my site.

645
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,760
It's LeechFromLoki.tk.

646
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,480
That's right, LeechFromLoki.

647
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,080
And it's got a pretty cool interface.

648
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,520
All that's up there right now is just two of my originals.

649
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,060
I've got one for Fire in the Dark

650
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,520
and one for the Quake 2 theme.

651
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,120
it's kind of like some hard rock kind of stuff, I guess.

652
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,960
And then...

653
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,360
I like the layout of the site, by the way.

654
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,840
You got that Never Look Back thing going on.

655
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,680
It's pretty cool.

656
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,480
Yeah, I have the Never Look Back G2 Arts thing

657
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,000
as kind of my background there,

658
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,560
and it's a pretty strange interface.

659
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,720
It's kind of cool.

660
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,520
And so I have tons of web space.

661
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,640
I've got like 50 megs for stuff right now,

662
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,920
and they didn't really say in this claimer

663
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,640
that I couldn't have more than one site.

664
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,760
So I guess really I have unlimited web space

665
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
and unlimited bandwidth, so that's kind of cool.

666
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,960
maybe later on forms will be coming up because I also have the capability to do

667
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,320
that and so yeah it'll be fun we need orange lounge forms so you might have to

668
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,600
work that in for us I could do that yeah all right good deal good deal can I give

669
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,280
an update on my site yes it's 20 20

670
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Oh, God, you suck. Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

671
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,280
You're going to attack her or attack me first, because I am my joke.

672
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Brad, you suck. Thank you.

673
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,280
Okay, now you can attack her.

674
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Oh, dear God. By the way, for those that have been bitching about how bad the Orange Lounge site has been looking, because it's really old,

675
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,280
SoCalKicks, by the way, one of our early listeners, being one of those people that always bitched about how bad it looked, I said, fine, SoCalKicks, you do a new site.

676
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:29,280
So he said, okay. So, he's supposed to be working on that for us, so we'll have a new site soon. That's all I can tell you.

677
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Let's see. Let's talk about Max USA. DDR Max USA. What?

678
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,280
Yeah, it's Max USA.

679
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
Oh, you mean the one that's off by a measure?

680
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,480
Well, no, no, no. It's actually okay. Last time we were here in the room talking, they

681
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,360
had released the demo on the official PlayStation Magazine, and two of the songs were off by

682
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,560
complete measure. However, from what I understand, they released a new demo to GameStops across

683
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,880
America. I believe Jamie said she has one, because her fiancé is a manager of a GameStop.

684
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,140
She has one of those demo discs, and from what I understand, it's fixed. They did fix

685
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:15,940
those measures they're right on yeah I don't I don't know if um I don't know

686
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,420
if there were any new songs in that demo now I know when they went in and hacked

687
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,300
the song list like they did last time that they found what's kind of assumed

688
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,860
to be a pretty damn close to the actual list going on I don't know if you want

689
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,340
to elaborate on that okay because you look at more of that stuff than I do

690
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,300
what what they did is they kind of got another list it's pretty similar to the

691
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,860
last one a lot of things people were saying before is there's not gonna be

692
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,300
ghosts there's not gonna be cockamay you guys are wrong so on this list there

693
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,700
isn't ghosts or cockamay because it's more of an update which is kind of

694
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,900
strange because you think well gee you know this list got leaked up before it

695
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,060
let's not put it in when we fix the demo this time oh well you know what I bet

696
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,700
though because those that demo only came out about what a week after the the list

697
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,540
was leaked right but they probably have to do those demos to get them burned and

698
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:08,540
mass and everything. That demo was probably done about six weeks ago.

699
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,540
alphabetical order from the rest. It was kind of weird.

700
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,540
Yeah, but the list wasn't alphabetical in the first place. The guy put him in alphabetical order.

701
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
Oh, I didn't realize that. I'm sorry.

702
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
So that has nothing to do with it.

703
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,540
It's still kind of weird.

704
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:49,540
When I saw When a Man Loves a Woman on there, I was like, that cannot be in the game. Come on.

705
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:58,540
Yeah, but what about Be in My Paradise? I'm just kidding. Be in My Paradise isn't in there either, I don't think. Was it?

706
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,460
anyways you have you've ever been all day the possible mission on Commodore

707
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,300
sixty-four the city so like right now pretty far the attack

708
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,300
uh...

709
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,300
they are

710
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,680
they forever

711
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,600
in my room

712
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
anyway yes

713
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,300
anyways high world

714
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,060
uh...

715
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,860
so anyways uh...

716
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,180
some of these there were on there though like

717
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,540
that he mentioned that were also in uh... this is very mixed was uh...

718
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,000
the bad touch

719
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
which I don't know.

720
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,440
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals.

721
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,640
I don't think so.

722
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Okay.

723
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,580
Just stay with me for a second here.

724
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,960
I have my own theory as to why that's inaccurate, but you can tell your theory and I'll tell

725
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
mine.

726
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Okay.

727
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,960
Here's my theory.

728
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,920
Now, this is possible that when they were doing the licensing for, you know, Dancing

729
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,720
Stage, you know, Party Mix, where they could have done it like where they were going to

730
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,800
put it in this game and that game, which, you know, that can make sense.

731
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,200
Now, I don't know if...

732
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,920
Now, I do understand that Dancing Stage Party Mix is for the PlayStation PS1.

733
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
Right.

734
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,080
I don't know how that could be carried over to the PS2 list, that wouldn't make any sense.

735
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,440
I could understand if, like, Gnomics had that stuff in there or something like that, and

736
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,720
that didn't end up being in there because they were making, you know, Densey Stage party

737
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,940
mix at the same time, they could be working on the engine at the same time.

738
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,100
My theory as to why they're not in there is in that box art that was released about four

739
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,880
weeks ago, because if, you know, one of those songs also on that list is Kylie Minogue,

740
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,880
Can't Get You Outta My Head.

741
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,040
Now, if that were actually in the game, I would think that would be the first name that

742
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,220
would be on that cover, because she's a multi-platinum selling worldwide artist.

743
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,600
Certainly more well-known than Darude, I would think.

744
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,300
I think her name would have been on there at the top billing, so I don't think that

745
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,000
song's in there, and I think it kind of voids out all the Euromix ones.

746
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,400
But that's just my theory.

747
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,400
I could be wrong.

748
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
But I don't think I am.

749
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Who knows?

750
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Maybe.

751
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,600
Maybe it could be a hidden thing, but I would think if I were Konami and I had to have spent

752
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,820
lots of money to get a Kylie Minogue song in my game

753
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,400
I would make it a hidden song

754
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,280
I'd make it a selling point so

755
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,520
and don't you think

756
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,840
the representatives of Kylie Minogue would want you to put that kind of a thing on the cover

757
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,800
saying oh featuring Kylie Minogue blah blah blah

758
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,340
featuring Kylie Minogue's breasts

759
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,400
well I'm sorry oh yes you have this interesting theory on Kylie Minogue's teeth don't you?

760
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,480
was that you or was that someone else?

761
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,960
well they're big

762
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,880
They bite.

763
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,160
Hey, big and white, kind of like Brad.

764
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,320
How would you know?

765
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,960
Wait, let's not go there.

766
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,160
You're standing right in front of me.

767
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,520
Oh, I didn't mean that.

768
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,640
God, no.

769
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,880
So, I was walking down the street.

770
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,200
And?

771
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,080
NDDR Max USA?

772
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,840
NDDR Max USA, yeah.

773
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,600
You know what, honestly, I have a confession to make, guys.

774
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,660
What?

775
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,520
I haven't.

776
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,640
Don't worry, sweetie.

777
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,160
It's not what you think.

778
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,320
No, um...

779
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,560
I haven't played DDR in over a week.

780
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,840
Yeah, yeah.

781
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,680
Play a GASP! Wave file.

782
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,560
You have one? No? Okay.

783
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,160
Hey, Rob, get your head out of your ass to see if there's any tension.

784
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,200
Sorry, I'm being given some information. I have to see if I can give it out or not.

785
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,480
What were you saying?

786
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,400
I can't say it because I don't know if I can give it out or not!

787
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,580
No, I can't. I can.

788
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
Basically,

789
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,360
being told, okay, so maybe I'm wrong then with this news.

790
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,900
they're saying the box art is outdated

791
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,380
the yellow burst on the cover isn't really there it was just there for the

792
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,600
online version it's not on the real box art

793
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,500
so

794
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
okay so maybe they changed it

795
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,680
but i still don't think they're there

796
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,980
i still don't think they're there. Even more important than all that? I haven't played DDR in a week.

797
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,580
Oh yeah? Well I haven't played DDR since yesterday at home. All I gotta say is I don't care

798
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,460
I have it reserved it's coming out next Tuesday

799
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:55,460
i don't give a shit. I think at this point none of us really give a shit what's on it, just release the damn thing already so we can play it.

800
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,460
I'd rather be surprised, you know? I already pre-ordered it too.

801
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:05,460
So, well, is there a real dilemma here? What? That comes out the same day Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out.

802
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,460
I'm like, shit! I can't play both! I'm just gonna take the whole week off.

803
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:18,460
Maybe they should make a version where it's all DDR music in the radio of Grand Theft Auto, because you know they've got the radio.

804
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,460
Uh, no. Anyways.

805
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:28,460
Watch, watch. I bet you anything, the exact same day those two games come out is the day we finally get 2DX in Sacramento, I bet you anything.

806
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,460
It's all going to happen the same day.

807
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,460
I know me and probably a bunch of other people will be ripping all those songs and set files to play them.

808
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,460
DDR Max, oh my god, you're going to blow your load!

809
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,460
Sorry, that's an inside room joke. Sorry, you guys.

810
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,460
Yeah, anyways, you'll probably see the sim files out the same week, guaranteed.

811
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,460
For what? The new stuff?

812
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,460
Oh, yeah.

813
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,460
Oh, yeah. You guys are crazy. You have those sim files around.

814
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,460
I remember that they were already trying to find AeroCharts.

815
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,460
We'll talk about Xtreme a little later in the show,

816
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,460
but they were already trying to find the AeroCharts for Xtreme.

817
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,460
I'm watching that one Japanese site that's got the Max 2 stuff,

818
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,460
because they're the first ones that have the Max 2 AeroCharts, and I'm waiting.

819
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
Just waiting.

820
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,460
I'm just waiting.

821
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:15,180
Alright, I actually want to play for you an MP3 of one of the new DDR Maxx USA songs.

822
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,580
I'm just going to play one for you guys, we're going to play Just Leave Me Alone.

823
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,700
This is by a group, I believe they're called Venus, and this MP3 is coming from, no, it's

824
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,020
not Michael Jackson, I'm sorry, yes, this is coming from SoCalKicks.com, and he actually

825
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:34,740
has a bunch of MP3s of songs that are going to be on DDR Maxx USA, so if you like this,

826
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,340
you want to hear the rest of them, go visit his site, SoCalKicks.com, and he'll appreciate

827
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,800
I'm plugging the hell out of them right there.

828
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,200
You guys are so wrong.

829
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
I hate you.

830
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,720
What were you doing last night, Rob, when I tried to call?

831
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,640
I just want you to wait for the all caps line yelling at you guys right here in about two

832
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,640
seconds.

833
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,640
Anyway.

834
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,060
Oh, not all caps.

835
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,060
That's such rude.

836
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,520
Or maybe you'll do that AZN type of typing.

837
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,860
Anyway, if you like this MP3 you can go over to that site and get the rest of them.

838
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,460
It's not the actual edit that's going to be in DDR.

839
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,540
It is edited down to a minute and a half, about, and from what I'm told, it's not the

840
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,180
actual one, but it's kind of close, whatever that means.

841
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,920
So take it or leave it, here it is.

842
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,100
This is, sometimes I wish we were a TV show and the rest of you don't.

843
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I'm going to play from DDR Max USA, this is Venus with Just Leave Me Alone.

844
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:07,100
There's no need to sit deep inside my heart, inside my soul

845
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:34,100
Why? You leave me alone, don't tell me why. There ain't no need to carry on. You leave me alone if I'm not right.

846
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:39,100
And why do you leave me alone so many days?

847
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,100
You're thinking of you so many nights

848
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,100
You leave me alone when it comes to time

849
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,100
Tell me why

850
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,100
Tell me why

851
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:26,060
Alright, you heard it here first.

852
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,140
or you heard it here second if you are already a so-called Texas site

853
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,240
that was Venus with Jay you just leave me alone and that's gonna be

854
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,780
and Brad you should take that advice just leave me alone you fucking bastard

855
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,860
you're just leaving me alone guys

856
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,540
I hate you so much

857
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,020
why did I invite you over here tonight oh yeah I needed

858
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,740
I needed more people here cause Jamie wasn't gonna be here Jamie's nice to me

859
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,600
you're mean

860
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,680
yes hi this is one of my other roommates Neil what's up

861
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,620
was a lot of the money world

862
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:01,840
if you could say if you say one thing to all the money there it's out there what

863
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,760
you to tell

864
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,700
thank you i do that was coming

865
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:11,640
now get out of the room we're doing show

866
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,140
would you guys think that song is is that the first time he has a good that

867
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,100
was too

868
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,200
and what do you think

869
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,280
that thing you were doing you came out and you said i'm good at it

870
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,280
What the hell were you saying while that song was playing?

871
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,280
It was more Kentucky Fried Movie.

872
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,280
Oh, sorry. Okay.

873
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,280
Big Jim Slade.

874
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,280
Anyway, no, but it's better than the Fetus Fury songs.

875
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,280
That one was true.

876
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Alright, fair enough.

877
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,280
I like Dark Black Forest better.

878
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,280
I think that song kicks so much ass that

879
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,280
Dark Black Forest is going to be in DDR, but

880
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,280
that's pretty good, it ain't so bad.

881
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,280
So if you like that, go over to

882
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,280
SoCalKicks.com and there's more and

883
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,280
maybe we'll be adding some of those to the

884
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,400
launch playlist. However, I'm kind of holding out to get the actual rips from the actual

885
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,200
game, which I'm sure will be out no less than 30 minutes after the game hits shelves, if

886
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:04,560
not sooner. So we'll see. Damn right. Can we do a list list tonight? What do you want

887
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:11,120
to do a list list for? I don't know. Let's do a list list for something not even related

888
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,440
to DDR. You guys think about it. We'll see. If we got time, we'll do one. We haven't done

889
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,440
anything. We haven't done the FUs of the weekend. I know. We're still going. Keep going.

890
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,440
What time is it?

891
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,440
It's 8.02, we're halfway there.

892
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
You guys want to do F-use the Wii? I don't have anything else to add on Max USA.

893
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
I don't really have any important evidence.

894
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,440
There's really no other news on Max USA for me to report other than it's almost here.

895
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,440
It's the extreme!

896
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,440
We'll do extreme after the next break, because there's a lot to say on that.

897
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,440
All I have to say is, Naoki is such a chick.

898
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,440
Is such a chick.

899
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,440
I'm sorry.

900
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
If anyone's recording the show, I want that sound clip.

901
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,440
He can't look any more like a woman than he does now.

902
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,240
What, is the sex change coming next?

903
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,800
I mean, that one picture that we have of him

904
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,920
in the New Naoki Journal where he's at the test location,

905
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,400
they show a back shot of him.

906
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,840
His hair is like really long.

907
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,760
He's wearing this like dress suit thing

908
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,760
that looks like a woman's...

909
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,800
I don't even know what it is.

910
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,160
It's just, he looks like a chick.

911
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,980
It's sad.

912
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,840
Well, next they're gonna have him in the schoolgirl outfit,

913
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,760
so don't worry.

914
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,760
Then we'll know.

915
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,760
Bishonen.

916
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,000
He's not even Bishonen, though, honestly.

917
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,400
I do not think he's...

918
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,740
I mean, I'm not gay or anything, man.

919
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:27,680
I think Depeche was a pretty sweet band, but I'm just kidding.

920
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,840
Okay, somebody in the hallway just said, I don't know if there's anything wrong with

921
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
that.

922
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,400
Wow, it's an audience participation show.

923
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
I didn't know.

924
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
I know.

925
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,400
Yeah.

926
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,240
Speaking of sound clips, this is going to be very random, but...

927
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,240
Janet.

928
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,240
Be so hoggie.

929
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,240
I said I'd play that, so never mind.

930
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
What is that?

931
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,240
Me so honky?

932
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,240
I'm just embarrassing somebody right now, don't worry about it.

933
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
Me so honky?

934
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,240
I'll tell you guys during the break.

935
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,240
Me so honky?

936
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
No, it's not JB.

937
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
Can we say who that is on air?

938
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,240
If they fess up in the chat room, then I'll say on air, but if they don't...

939
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,240
If they don't, then I'll tell you guys during the break.

940
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,240
Rob, we've got some blackmail stuff for you, so...

941
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,240
No you don't!

942
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,240
Yeah, we do.

943
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,240
What?

944
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,240
Life is unfair.

945
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,240
Shut up!

946
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
Okay, we won't go there.

947
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
Oh, yes. Anything else to say on Max USA?

948
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
No?

949
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,240
I have some rips about it.

950
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Oh, it's coming out earlier than expected. I don't think we mentioned that. It's going to be out at the end of October. Halloween week.

951
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,240
Yes, it's coming out not this coming up Tuesday, but the Tuesday after, supposedly. Anywhere that week, I guess.

952
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,240
I've been hearing weird things.

953
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,240
And I'm sure we'll be doing something very special on Orange Lounge.

954
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,240
Sandstorm. Yay.

955
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,160
Yes, I cannot wait to play a sandstorm sandstorm is the best ever

956
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,920
Guy you know what it's like it's like going to a giant rave. I'm so fucked up

957
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,520
Let's have some key and make out

958
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,320
Then we could be friends. Okay, that joke is weeks old. We can't do that anymore. I

959
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:06,480
Did we did here with the last song that unlock is supposedly what's that the drop the bomb want the bomb? Yeah

960
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,480
Yay. Yay for dropping bombs.

961
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,480
I wish they really would.

962
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,480
I wish they really would drop the goddamn bomb. That thing is so annoying.

963
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,480
Yeah, one of ScottieD's finest songs, Stick Around.

964
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,480
You know, you can see ScottieD for like half a second in the Stick Around video,

965
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,480
right before the gerbils that make out with each other.

966
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,480
That is the worst video slash song ever.

967
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
I disagree, I like that song.

968
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,480
No, I don't care.

969
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,480
I think you're stupid.

970
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,480
Well speaking of...

971
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,480
Okay, well anyways, this is way off topic.

972
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,480
There's that song that's in Guitar Freak's eighth mix, or whatever.

973
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,480
That's um, it's Polteri and some other band.

974
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,480
Man, she totally butchers that song too.

975
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,480
You wanna talk about Polteri not being able to sing?

976
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,480
What was that one song with Angel featuring Angel?

977
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,480
She cannot sing. Was it Ultra High Heels or something like that?

978
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:09,480
Yeah, Ultra High Heels. I'm sorry, but that chick cannot sing. Paula Terry has a voice, but that chick doesn't. Okay, bye.

979
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,480
No, Megu cannot sing.

980
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:22,480
You know why he says her name? The only shitty thing about Stick Around is the lyrics. The lyrics are so awful. They are awful. They are goddamn awful.

981
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,400
Video is terrible, the singing is terrible, the lyrics are terrible, the song is terrible,

982
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,400
gee, I don't know.

983
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,240
Okay, I have to defend it, the music itself is alright, the singing is alright.

984
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,240
I like Miracleman.

985
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:42,280
It's cute though, it's all happy, and the video, it looks like, at the very beginning

986
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,280
of the video, it looks like we're going to go on a safari.

987
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,040
God, why don't I just put on the Discovery Channel?

988
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,800
At least I'll hear better music.

989
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,600
Alright, speaking of Guitar Freaks to Draw Mania, I'm glad you brought this up, I wanted

990
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,600
to mention this real fast.

991
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,860
For the first time, it sounds like they're going to be doing a, what they're calling

992
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:01,800
power-up, which is basically 8th mix, 7th mix plus, you can think about it like DDR,

993
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,320
they're doing a new version of Guitar Freaks to Draw Mania called the power-up.

994
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:11,700
And from what we're being told, there's going to be some new songs in it, begin by Ryu Kisoka,

995
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,600
which is one of the B4U chicks, if I'm not mistaken, Ryu, oh sorry, I missed the I, my

996
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,600
bad.

997
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,600
Power Up!

998
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:26,600
And they're returning, they're putting in some more of the old songs that are coming back like Fire in the Dark and On Our Way.

999
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,600
How about Haru Spring?

1000
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,600
Isn't Haru Spring in?

1001
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:38,600
Those bastards! I only played it once and Jamie made me play Another World and then I played the one where you do the steel drums.

1002
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,600
Oh, Kachaka.

1003
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,600
Kachaka, I like that one, that was cool.

1004
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,600
My third favorite song.

1005
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
I got a shitty grade but I did good.

1006
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,600
No, um, what's the Extra Stage called? It's in Japanese, but it's really, really fun.

1007
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
Is it the Orange Lounge song?

1008
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,600
It's got the characters, the two girls, you know?

1009
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
But I don't think it's Orange Lounge.

1010
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,600
That is the coolest song ever.

1011
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,600
So cool. The Extra Stage, on DrumMania and Guitars.

1012
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Oh, yeah, it's good.

1013
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,600
I'm sure some people in our chat room will fill us in on all that.

1014
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,600
It's really hyper and petty.

1015
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
We honky. We don't know how to read Japanese.

1016
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Yeah, let's take a break. What do you guys want to play?

1017
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
I have no ideas. Any requests in here?

1018
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
play a abba

1019
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
no no abba

1020
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,600
oh no

1021
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,600
we will do abba

1022
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
we're gonna do

1023
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
we're only kidding

1024
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
no we're gonna do

1025
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,600
you got me started

1026
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
we did hyper-boundary gate before the show

1027
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,600
you were in the other room

1028
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,600
or we could do Michael Bolton

1029
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
or no

1030
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,600
Michael Bolton

1031
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,600
i'm gonna do

1032
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,600
when a man becomes a woman

1033
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
we'll do some abba

1034
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
we're gonna do erotic covering abba

1035
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
though

1036
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
that's what we're gonna play

1037
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:46,120
So, in the meantime, we're gonna start this set off with, uh, I don't know. Oh, I like

1038
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,040
this one. This is one of my favorite songs from 2DX. We'll start off with this. You're

1039
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,840
listening to Orange Launch Radio. We'll be right back, and then we're gonna talk about

1040
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,500
DDR Extreme and the FUs of the Week. Also, if you want to send me your FUs of the Week

1041
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,120
over private message, you can do that now in the chat room, and we'll get to that coming

1042
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:08,120
back.

1043
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:57,040
Moving back when I was a child and dream Moving back where I was a child and dream

1044
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,040
I tried to take you, come to me

1045
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,040
But then first thing, set me free

1046
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,040
And fly away to everywhere

1047
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:13,040
I could do anything

1048
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:19,040
I can get a thing, oh

1049
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:25,040
I did nothing wrong, oh

1050
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,600
Hey these wings.

1051
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,820
Lookin' back when I was on Chad and Blue

1052
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,620
Those are my observed, it didn't come to me

1053
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:40,960
Of course I think of you if we don't fly away

1054
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,500
I just like you

1055
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,680
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1056
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,340
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1057
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,420
Baby

1058
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,260
I

1059
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:58,260
After all I've come to be your name

1060
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:47,260
I wasn't jealous before we met Now every born that I see is a potential friend

1061
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:57,260
And never says if it isn't nice You've heard me sayin' that smoking was my only fight

1062
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:05,260
Now I didn't dream Now everything is new

1063
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:14,260
And all I've learned has overturned I left off you

1064
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:21,260
Don't go racing, you're in motion

1065
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:28,260
Get all your love on me

1066
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,260
It was like shooting a certain night

1067
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:42,260
A little small talk is fine and baby I'm stuck

1068
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,260
I still don't know what you've done with me

1069
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,260
A grown up woman should never fall so easily

1070
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,260
I see the kind of fear

1071
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,260
And I don't have it near

1072
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,260
I'm satisfied

1073
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,260
I keep my pride

1074
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,260
But I beg you dear

1075
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:18,260
Don't come wasting your devotion

1076
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:24,260
Lay all your love on me

1077
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:32,260
Don't come sharing your devotion

1078
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:38,260
Lay all your love for me

1079
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,260
I've had a few little love affairs

1080
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:55,260
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scared

1081
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,260
I used to sing at the sunset bar

1082
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:06,260
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

1083
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
Cause everything is new

1084
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,260
And everything is you

1085
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,260
And all I've learned

1086
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,260
Has over time

1087
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,260
What can I do?

1088
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:37,260
Don't come wasting your devotion Lay all your love on me

1089
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:46,260
Don't go sharing your devotion

1090
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:51,260
Lay all your love on me

1091
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:23,260
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1092
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,780
during the break by the way you are listening to orange on radio we were

1093
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,560
talking about guitar freaks 8th and drum mania 7th before the break and thank you

1094
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,980
to our kdn42 who's filling us in calling saying that the extra stage is called

1095
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:05,820
Mikaneiko rock no non mechanical it's Japanese Mikaneiko rock rock sounds like

1096
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:11,740
mechanical but remember there's that cat on parfait the cat oh if Justin's

1097
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,540
listening I'm sure he likes that we gotta have them back on the show by the

1098
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,740
way. Justin and Mike, they were here a few weeks ago, actually a few months ago at this

1099
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,460
point. Yeah, they need to return my freaking BeatMania 5 key controller. Oh, oh, oh. About

1100
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,380
time I got that thing back. I think they're both listening, so if you want to put out

1101
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,980
a special shout out. Need controller, want the controller. Can't play BeatMania without

1102
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:36,920
a controller. And Arkadian thinks that the long version extra stage is something like

1103
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:43,560
Suminagara Kanojo, but not sure. No, I'm, the bonus stage extra stage is crap. Oh, okay,

1104
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:48,560
well thank you thank you for sharing

1105
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,480
fair enough

1106
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:54,720
i love that song power

1107
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:59,800
power you just like power don't you power and i also like uh... candy star

1108
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,180
i don't really like that one i was expecting to play the actual candy

1109
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:07,200
it could be worse though it could have had crash

1110
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,160
the

1111
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,500
ingress version of uh...

1112
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,340
one of those songs

1113
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,260
yeah that break down thank you

1114
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,340
what the hell can i

1115
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,740
i can't think of a seat back there under control

1116
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:25,200
the worst song ever

1117
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,420
okay fine

1118
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,920
the middle isn't that bad

1119
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,860
at the beginning is

1120
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:33,260
crash it

1121
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,800
sounds like war

1122
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,820
uh... tdr mike says you'll get it back when they go to shaft

1123
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:40,920
yes go to shaft

1124
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,460
everybody everybody should go to shaft november fifth

1125
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,660

1127
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,320
okay let's do the f use the week

1128
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,000
jamie's not here

1129
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,900
so but if you were here

1130
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,220
This is the part of the show where she'd kick off the F.U. of the week.

1131
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:08,180
And so I'm sure her first F.U. of the week would be towards traffic, because that's what's

1132
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,680
keeping her from the show tonight.

1133
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,620
So on behalf of Dark Sector, I would like to enter in that F.U. of the week to traffic.

1134
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,420
Brad, you have an F.U. of the week.

1135
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,420
Hangovers.

1136
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,420
Oh, why is that?

1137
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,080
Well, they're not fun.

1138
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,380
That's why you're supposed to drink bread and eat water when you're getting drunk.

1139
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,380
Drink bread and eat water.

1140
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,680
Is that what I just said?

1141
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,680
Are you drunk?

1142
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
I'm sorry.

1143
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:36,600
No, that's not that big of a deal.

1144
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,600
How about you, Rob?

1145
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,600
Do you have an F.U.?

1146
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Do I have an F.U. of the week?

1147
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,600
I'm not sure yet.

1148
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
Go to the others.

1149
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Loki?

1150
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Okay, how about Dave?

1151
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Dave, do you have an F.U. of the week?

1152
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
I do.

1153
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Kind of.

1154
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,080
F.U. to all my teachers at school for giving me way too much homework.

1155
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,360
I missed one day of school, I think two weeks ago, and somehow it was the one day where

1156
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,200
where all the teachers have signed about ten assignments

1157
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,400
for the next two weeks of school, and so I missed that day.

1158
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,480
Now I've got a million assignments.

1159
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,360
Fuck you, teachers! I know you're listening!

1160
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,700
Go away!

1161
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,320
That's it!

1162
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,760
You get detention for a whole year!

1163
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,240
Some advice. Don't miss school.

1164
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,280
Stay in school, kids.

1165
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,960
Be cool, stay in school!

1166
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,320
Oh, so what if your state goes to school? Step to a slim gym!

1167
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,400
Oh yeah!

1168
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,400
Okay, anyways, uh, my F.U. of the week has-

1169
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Wait, hold on.

1170
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,900
Oh, I was going to stay in school, then I threw up over someone else's backpack.

1171
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:34,900
Ew!

1172
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,900
Like, okay, go to the office.

1173
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,900
Grody.

1174
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,900
They didn't give me a chance.

1175
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,900
Not much is funnier than vomit, seriously.

1176
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,900
Come on, guys.

1177
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:49,400
So yeah, uh, my F.U. of the week, once again, goes to, uh, Golf Land Sun Splash.

1178
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,400
Again!

1179
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,900
Big fat surprise.

1180
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,900
Let's start with the fact that Initial D is broken already.

1181
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,900
WHAT?!

1182
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
One of them is broken.

1183
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,900
No, that's unacceptable!

1184
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,900
UNACCEPTABLE!

1185
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,900
Because of that one being broken, I had to wait for over half an hour to play one game of it.

1186
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:11,900
It's like the new DDR or something.

1187
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,900
UNACCEPTABLE!

1188
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:19,900
Anyways, that and also because of the fact that they're advertising that MechWarrior 4 is in the sumo,

1189
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:25,260
in the CMO, but for some reason it's not there anymore. You can't play MechWarrior 4. So

1190
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,660
those bastards that put in money...

1191
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,300
Wait a minute, I played MechWarrior 4 on that thing.

1192
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:29,980
Now.

1193
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,580
So somebody downgraded it?

1194
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,780
I guess.

1195
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:39,020
Major props to those guys. Major props. That takes talent to be that stupid.

1196
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,300
Fucking speed theming game. I hate that game.

1197
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:48,460
I own that game. I still own that game for almost free. It's not for free because I have

1198
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:55,460
to pay for it. You could always steal a little kid's tokens. Or... Rent it for a small fee.

1199
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:02,180
Why do that when I can just play like a dollar and win a thousand tickets? What are you gonna

1200
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,380
do with the tickets? You win like a thousand tickets and then what? You get to take something

1201
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:12,380
that's worth a dollar? You get stuff! I bought... I spent probably about five or four dollars

1202
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,200
four dollars plan again

1203
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,800
which is a lot of money

1204
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,100
and i got

1205
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,580
a later p p record

1206
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,940
who care like more a carry glitter

1207
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,980
it looks kind of like the inside

1208
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,420
of one of those model and i think that all of

1209
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,060
tons of balls and like that

1210
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,180
and i think that

1211
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,740
uh...

1212
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,100
no i don't

1213
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,460
it both maybe

1214
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:47,460
I have balls, I just don't like balls.

1215
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,380
Irene, do you have any FUs of the week?

1216
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,180
Yeah, let's change topics.

1217
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,060
Do you like balls?

1218
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:57,500
So, I'm kind of sort of pissed off at my car because it kind of broke down.

1219
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,620
But I'm even more pissed off

1220
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:06,620
at book and automotive stores for not carrying the repair manual from my car, so fuck you.

1221
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:13,620
p0k3smot42o1 my f-u of the week would go to the entire week itself

1222
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,540
uh... i'm not gonna talk about on the show for those that know me

1223
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,540
it was a really shitty week so let's just leave it at that so that's why i

1224
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,360
feel the latest all week

1225
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,460
the whole damn thing

1226
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,940
let's get to the chat room

1227
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:56,220
no because kind of angry i hate myself but i want to die i'd slash my wrist the

1228
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:03,220
other day don't do that

1229
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:10,980
Okay, let's talk about the chat room FUs, those that have been sent to me shall we.

1230
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,460
How are you?

1231
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,460
You wanna read one?

1232
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,460
Okay, let's see...

1233
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,580
Read, oh read SoCal Kicks is, then.

1234
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,940
Read that one.

1235
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,980
SoCal Kicks says, FU!

1236
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:20,980
Sky?

1237
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,060
Actually, it means FU.

1238
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,600
FU Sky for saving that sound clip.

1239
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,260
You know that Me So Hungry one?

1240
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,260
Ohhhhh!

1241
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,260
Hahahaha!

1242
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,260
Ohhhhh!

1243
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,740
Fuck you everyone who can't understand what I said.

1244
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,140
It's Hungie, not Hunkey!

1245
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:40,140
and fuck you PSATs because I got worried for nothing, they were the easiest shit ever.

1246
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:47,860
I read that it said Hongi, I just thought it sounded funnier as Hongi, I'm sorry Sokaluke.

1247
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:52,820
Uhh, Twen sent me some FUs earlier, people stomping on the PPP machine, which makes no

1248
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,420
sense at all.

1249
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,380
You know what, I saw some girl playing it completely with her feet, I guess she didn't

1250
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,380
understand that they're, you know, it's a hand game.

1251
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:07,380
It's like Russian Dance Revolution, you use your feet to hit all the heroes.

1252
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:12,380
And then there's like a gun there for you to shoot yourself in Russian Roulette.

1253
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:16,380
Did you ever think, by the way, if they did release an American version of PPP, the catch-up song would be on it? I bet you anything.

1254
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:27,380
An F you to the chat room for somehow going in to invite only on Friday night. Yeah, that was my fault, fuck you.

1255
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:34,900
Friday night. Yeah, that was my fault. Fuck you. I'm only human, you ass. F you to JB's

1256
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:41,020
dad for wanting to go online so he had to leave. But he's back now, so never mind.

1257
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:45,100
Black Lab sent me one before he had to go. He was here earlier, but he had to go. He

1258
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,780
says, fuck his parents shitty computer for being slow and the only computer in the house.

1259
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,980
Fuck his little brother for being such a little dickhead this weekend that he's had to watch

1260
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:57,980
And fuck Star Fox Adventures on GameCube for being too goddamn easy since I beat it in 13 hours flat.

1261
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,980
Well, I only played it for 5 minutes and I knew it sucked.

1262
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,980
Yeah, I know, I didn't even have to play it and I can tell it sucks. Hello?

1263
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,980
Uh, 23rd Magus says, fuck you to the cold virus for keeping me home all weekend.

1264
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:10,980
I would have been at RVGL Saturday for Arcade Mania for once. Fuck the cold.

1265
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,980
That's okay, you didn't miss anything. All the machines are broken.

1266
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:20,980
JB says, uh, his F.U. is to RVGL.

1267
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:24,980
Little kids like to grab asses at RVGL, he's learned.

1268
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,980
Well, isn't that something?

1269
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:32,980
Oh, and he told me this, it was literal as in, I think, like, really literal.

1270
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,980
Like, very little kid, like a girl or something, I don't know, like four or eight or something.

1271
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,980
At least it was a chick grabbing his ass.

1272
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:44,980
Yeah, if, like, there was a five-year-old kid grabbing his ass, that would be kind of freaky.

1273
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,980
It's Anna Nicole Smith Jr.

1274
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,980
either way it's illegal, so come on

1275
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,980
JB would also like to state that Jenny Rom will be his future Rife

1276
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:55,980
Sure, sure

1277
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,980
Rife, I'm sorry, I was Japanese for a minute there

1278
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,980
Wife!

1279
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,980
Watch the movie Simone

1280
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,980
DDR Mike says that, oh this isn't an F.U.

1281
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,980
He's telling me when he's going to come visit

1282
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,980
Nevermind, that's not an F.U.

1283
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,980
DCB says F.U. to himself for coming in late

1284
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:24,460
that's one tardy detention for a whole week for DCB I don't know some guy in

1285
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:30,060
the chat room these people they're all my best friends I keep tabs on them all

1286
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,840
the time I don't know they just come in on Sunday I read their f-use and they're

1287
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:40,240
happy how the show works jazz says f you two negative immature people who

1288
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:45,000
There seemingly can only solve problems with violence.

1289
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
But violence is the only way!

1290
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,520
You're right.

1291
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:56,520
Uh, Matt, it, er, sorry, Loki.

1292
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,040
What? Why do they use violence? Why don't they use cellos?

1293
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,840
That's violence, dear. That's guns.

1294
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,120
Wha, wha, whaaaaa!

1295
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,680
Jazz is cool.

1296
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,100
He says, F you to Roseville Golf Land because it's a shithole and everything is broken.

1297
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,900
The game room and Scandi are 600 times better.

1298
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:19,140
Once again, getting into local DDR politics on this international program, but that's

1299
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,740
okay.

1300
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,740
Everybody should know what a shithole Roseville Golf Land is.

1301
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:23,740
Exactly.

1302
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,940
Maybe one of the assholes from Golf Land will be listening.

1303
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:26,940
You know what I heard?

1304
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:27,940
Probably not.

1305
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,020
You remember that one time that I went over there and took pictures of all the broken

1306
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,020
shit?

1307
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,060
That some of the employees got online and saw that?

1308
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,060
They were pissed.

1309
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,060
Pissed about why?

1310
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,060
Pissed about what?

1311
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,060
That they're telling the truth?

1312
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:43,100
truth? God! Fuck you! Yeah, I'm gonna do it again! Just for that! And then I'm gonna take

1313
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,700
pictures of you when you're picking your nose and taking breaks when you shouldn't be and

1314
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:51,580
telling off little kids and pissing in the cokes and whatever you do over there. F you!

1315
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:57,700
I hate you! Die! No, but see, like, they just really actually did the first teching that

1316
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,740
they've done in a couple of months and they fixed guitar freaks and keyboard reindeer.

1317
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,740
So, if you went there now, a lot of stuff wouldn't be broken.

1318
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,740
They turned up...

1319
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:10,740
Yeah, if you went there now, I'm sorry, you'd probably see everything broken again.

1320
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:17,740
Well, I went there earlier today, the Guitar Freaks was turned up really loud, nice and loud, drumming is turned down almost to silent.

1321
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:26,740
Let me add that I played Guitar Freaks for the first time in a long time, a couple days ago, and my ears were ringing afterwards. It was so loud.

1322
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:33,740
I guess they don't realize that these games are based on music, and you need to kind of make it sound good or else it's not worth playing.

1323
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,740
I want to play Godard Freaks of the Silent.

1324
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:41,740
I'm told that Roseville isn't the only golf land that's having problems apparently. SHGL got their 2DX screen fixed.

1325
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:51,740
I didn't even know that SHGL got 2DX back, but apparently they did. They got their screen fixed and now it's broken again.

1326
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:55,740
So, hey, it runs in the family I guess.

1327
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:02,340
We should just go to all the golf lands and quote-unquote overplay the games and make

1328
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:07,500
all of them, you know, wanting the arcade doctor and then they'll see how bad it's gonna

1329
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,500
affect.

1330
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Yeah.

1331
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
That's such a joke.

1332
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,540
I need to pay a visit to the arcade doctor.

1333
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:15,100
Is that all the golf lands that do that or is that just Roseville or do all the golf

1334
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,100
lands have the arcade doctor?

1335
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,100
Who cares?

1336
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,100
I think they know what I am implying.

1337
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:22,220
But they'll see how much it suffers, you know, and like, you know, yeah, they'll see how

1338
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,340
much people don't like it and then they won't get any business and they'll die.

1339
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:31,340
But the thing is, you can't go play the games if they're all broken already. We're not going to make any money.

1340
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:35,340
Well, the ones that are still working, we should just overplay them.

1341
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,340
Well, don't quote. Anyway, I want to finish up. There's some FUs.

1342
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,340
DDR Mike did send an FU after... Oh, yes, Irene, you have an FU.

1343
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:47,340
It's not quote-unquote. It's quote-end-quote. Why would you unquote something?

1344
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,340
Somebody please tell me. It's quote-end-quote.

1345
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,340
Shut up. You lose. You lose.

1346
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:59,340
DDR Mike says, F you to Mountain Mike's left side pad down arrow because it stuck for three

1347
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,340
minutes straight on Saturday night.

1348
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:08,340
Hey wait Rob, I have another F you. F you to you guys.

1349
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,340
Everybody hates you.

1350
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,340
You don't have any vanilla cokes though.

1351
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,180
I don't. Go buy one yourself. I'm sick of buying you people crap. I'm just ghetto poor

1352
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:20,300
this week. I'm going to the store after the show. Not that I'll do you any good until

1353
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,220
next week but hey just thought you'd enjoy knowing thanks a lot don't worry

1355
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:33,380

just kidding. You're right. We need to hurry up. We're not going to get to do list list

1360
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:59,140
if we don't talk about DDR Extreme. Talk list list. Screw that. Wait until next week. Alright.

1361
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:03,900
Let's talk about DDR Extreme. What do you want to say? Why don't you do a sim file update

1362
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:08,380
for us, Loki, and then lead on into DDR Extreme if you want. Go for it, dude. You're the one

1363
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:14,620
who wants to change topics. It's all you. Sorry. Let's start off with StepMania. Let's

1364
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:19,220

1365
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:23,560
step mania version three final uh... there's going to be going hopefully

1366
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:27,500
should be the final one a lot of fixes done there and that's available now from

1367
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,340
uh...

1368
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,060
source

1369
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:33,100
forged dot com or whatever their site is there's a link on that your maniacs go

1370
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,140
check that out

1371
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,420
so it's a pretty good i i played a little bit today it is a lot faster so

1372
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,620
uh...

1373
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,740
just go try that

1374
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:43,860
uh... see other than that d r east coast invasion is back up and some server

1375
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:48,060
problems earlier this week and everyone thought they were gone for good but they're back so

1376
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,060
go check them out.

1377
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,060
Any new contests by them coming up?

1378
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,060
Uh, no.

1379
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:56,120
They're doing right now one of the things, it's kind of like to get the most popular

1380
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,220
character in all the DDR games.

1381
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:02,220
They finished with the female characters and I believe, ah shit, I can't remember her name.

1382
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,220
Alice?

1383
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,220
Yeah.

1384
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:07,900
Alice, I don't know, I just, I'm just thinking, oh Emmy.

1385
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,900
Oh yeah, Emmy.

1386
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:09,900
No, no, no.

1387
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:10,900
Not Emmy.

1388
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,900
Alice, there's Alice.

1389
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,900
Yeah, Alice.

1390
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:16,900
Big surprise, Steve. I could have told you that contest in two seconds, but that's alright.

1391
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:48,900
The coolest thing is that you can speed up the speed of the song. That's the coolest. Not like how fast the arrows go, but the actual song.

1392
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:53,900
Like, I think it's up to 1.5 times the actual speed now. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

1393
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:59,900
But anyways, oh my gods, I can beat Max Unlimited S4R with two times speed. Oh my god, it's dizzy.

1394
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,900
Whatever.

1395
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:19,900
Were there any new released characters online for the next release?

1396
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,700
so they're doing them every two weeks now.

1397
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,180
I noticed it's on my Payday Fridays that they released two characters, it seems.

1398
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,940
Yeah, I mean, I really don't care. There are all these freaky, weird characters and no

1399
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:44,440
one plays that game, so it really doesn't matter. Aside from that, like I said, my site,

1400
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:49,300
I was thinking, you know, maybe once I get things going a little bit, since, you know,

1401
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,700
DDR East Coast Invasion does their own tourney mixes, they might actually run one. And actually

1402
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:57,620
have prizes, because you know me, in my edit contest, I had tons of prizes.

1403
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,740
yes so yes and you'll be doing all those door prices at SHAPT

1404
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:04,340
yes yeah i'll clean up my prize closet there right on

1405
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:09,300
oh you're cleaning out your closet oh that yeah

1406
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,580
ha ha ha anyway okay and now ddr maxx extreme yes

1407
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:19,140
maxx extreme they've been doing the uh the testing started this friday

1408
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,620
um back there in japan and uh people have been playing it and

1409
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,700
actually a bunch of new songs have come out

1410
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:31,820
a couple to mention. There's going to be a new Revenge song. It's all sixteenths and

1411
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:37,140
thirty-second notes. And it's sixty beats per minute. It's sixty-five beats per minute,

1412
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:43,980
yeah. Isn't it called DDR Extreme? Yes. Not Max Extreme? Whatever. Yeah, okay, bye. My

1413
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:49,180
bad. DDR Extreme. DDR Extreme. And that's called Bag. I don't know. What a name for

1414
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,180
Big asian groove.

1415
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:57,180
New paranoia coming out, paranoia survivor.

1416
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:01,180
It goes from 135 BPM to like 270.

1417
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:05,180
So that should be pretty ancient.

1418
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:10,180
Isn't there something that you have to do on that song? Like you double A it and you can get an extra stage or something?

1419
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:14,180
No. No. Stop! Damn it!

1420
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:21,180
So, here's what's going on with Paranoid Survivor. Like Max on the last song, if you double A, you get an extra stage.

1421
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:26,180
Well, the thing is, with the extra stage of Max, you can pick any song you want, plus some more actually appear.

1422
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:33,180
You have the new Max, which is Legend of Max that's going to be out, and then there's also Paranoid Survivor.

1423
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:38,180
Now, supposedly if you double A Legend of Max, you get Sakura.

1424
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:43,180
And I'd like to point out, I was correct, and I called it a long time ago that Sakura's going to be the bonus song.

1425
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,180
You're the shit.

1426
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:47,180
Yes, so I know that.

1427
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:55,180
And we haven't really heard, I guess, if there's another extra stage, you know, different one, if there's Paranoid Survivor, if someone, you know, double A's that.

1428
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:58,180
Every time I hear that, I think of that Destiny's Child song.

1429
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:01,180
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it.

1430
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,180
No, no, no, it's like this, you double A Paranoid Survivor, you get to vote somebody out of the arcade.

1431
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:10,180
Or as 23rd Magus says, out stomp, out wink, out dance.

1432
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,180
Exactly.

1433
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,180
What's out wink?

1434
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:15,180
What do you wink when you play DDR?

1435
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,180
Out twink.

1436
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,180
Out twink?

1437
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,180
Yeah, twink.

1438
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:19,180
I don't know.

1439
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:26,180
I've heard the word twink before, but it has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, I guarantee

1440
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:27,180
you that.

1441
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:28,180
I'm not going to elaborate.

1442
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:31,180
Other than that, let's see if we can pull up the song list here.

1443
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can pull up the song list.

1444
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:40,180
For those that don't know, one of the big people that gives us information on the Japanese

1445
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:48,640
these location tests is the guy known as Aaron in Japan. His website is over at aaroninjapan.com.

1446
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,800
Easy enough to remember. You should definitely check out his site because we're stealing

1447
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,600
some news from him right now and I have to credit where we're getting news from.

1448
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,200
Anyway, some of the new songs, they're gonna be in there. We've got

1449
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:04,320
Irresistible, or, what the hell is that? Irresistible Mint?

1450
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,360
Oh, oh, he meant Twink Out! Like, I think it's a rave thing.

1451
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:11,520
Okay, whatever. Anyway, that's a weird name for a song by Wildside.

1452
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,400
Irresistible Mint, whatever that means. That's stupid.

1453
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:20,160
Speed Over Beethoven, which is, you know, on Speed 9, I believe.

1454
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:24,600
That's pretty good. Then there's also We Are the Champions,

1455
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:31,600
a cover of that

1456
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:36,600
so it's it's it's a queen he makes

1457
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,340
anyways uh...

1458
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:38,880
big gate your extreme

1459
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,320
uh...

1460
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,480
that's the we've got twink revolution

1461
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:48,120
some of the older songs coming back we've got uh... damn derriam rhythm please synchronize

1462
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,080
love i believe in miracles if you were here

1463
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,120
and others

1464
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,680
There's a larger song list out there that has a lot more of the old original ones.

1465
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:59,580
From what I understand, every Max 2 track is back, and from what somebody else was saying...

1466
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:02,520
Every Max 2 track and every Max 1 track is going to be back.

1467
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,220
Except for Telephone Operator, right?

1468
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,800
Telephone Operator and Follow Me are still gone, from what I heard, right?

1469
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,620
But Ghost is back, and all the good ones are back except Telephone Operator, I love Telephone

1470
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,620
Operator.

1471
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:17,360
Bye-bye Baby Balloons back, much to our enjoyment.

1472
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:21,480
From what I hear is that initially you don't see them on the list, that you have to sort

1473
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,440
your list a different way to see them.

1474
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,480
That's what I'm hearing.

1475
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,480
I don't know if they have...

1476
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,480
Why would you do that?

1477
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,480
That doesn't make sense.

1478
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Well, no.

1479
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,200
I think that it's a huge list, I mean, you didn't see them right away.

1480
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,560
Also, they're going to have an unlock system, similar to the Macs do, except it's going

1481
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,280
to be fewer points in between, a ton more unlocks instead.

1482
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,880
You're going to have also, like before we've mentioned the non-stop mode, they're going

1483
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,560
actually have a player's best non-stop that you can play on there, which is kind of cool.

1484
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,240
It'd be the top four song.

1485
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,520
Arkadian can get out the pen and pencil again and start writing down player's best every

1486
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,240
week. That was pretty cool. I remember when Forthmix was out and he was writing it down

1487
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:58,840
every week, and it was like, it was like, Casey Kasem's top 40 and the player's best.

1488
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,800
Exactly.

1489
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,120
Sorry you had to be here. Inside joke, I guess.

1490
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:06,640
Then of course, you know, not to be, not, not any surprise at all, drop the bomb, the

1491
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,200
System FX mix.

1492
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,720
Of course, they couldn't stay U.S. exclusive for very long, but there are still some-

1493
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:16,360
i'm sure you'll see the dynamite rate one on there too i'm sure that's going to be in

1494
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:21,120
there so cold so cold uh... yes so in love kind lady g you know we're going to

1495
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,360
be on there

1496
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,840
and uh... can be

1497
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,080
can they tell us on the forces that he was an eight-footer

1498
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,360
but and now there's conflicting reports because one report saying the steps are

1499
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,380
as hard as the d w i just thought that every other reports and

1500
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,400
it's a footer

1501
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,000
i would i would say how much i believe the eight-footer thing before it would

1502
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,920
be able to go

1503
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,960
i don't know sources that this way at some point we will be able to make it

1504
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:42,960
hearts

1505
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,040
yes that's right you're gonna get in there and

1506
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,800
do your edits, your homemade edits

1507
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,860

that's gonna be in there um...

1513
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,240

01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,760

1518
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Frozen Array, Miracle Moon, L.E.D. Light Style, Destiny Lovers, and this is too cool, from

1519
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,080
Mambo A Go Go, Gamaland A Couple is on there, that rules.

1520
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:36,720
And not on this list right here, because this is an old list, JetWorld is on there.

1521
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,720
Very cool.

1522
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,720
JetWorld is on there.

1523
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,520
Let me tell them, the steps could be cool.

1524
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,440
Let me scroll on down and see if I see some other stuff.

1525
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,440
Why?

1526
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,440
Here's some stuff, these were in the ONI and non-stop courses, they're only available there

1527
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,440
apparently.

1528
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,680
Yeah, at least right now probably until you unlock them.

1529
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,120
They have Happy Wedding, I believe that's from 7-0.

1530
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,320
Somewhere Jamie is excited.

1531
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,260
general like i mentioned before

1532
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,480
is to be on their uh...

1533
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,620
colors

1534
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,660
police one hundred seconds

1535
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,760

1536
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,520

01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,360
why oh hello we didn't see them real

1539
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,860
anyways um...

1540
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,080
if you were here

1541
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,040
shooting star

1542
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,280
it came with

1543
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,960
but that yes sir that's about it

1544
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,600
that's much more uh...

1545
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,480
two hundred thirty songs

1546
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,640
uh... the test is only one fifty percent done something like that

1547
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,320
they didn't know when it was

1548
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,960
be released higher

1549
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,000
and the year

1550
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,960
early spring we've heard about it

1551
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:51,040
late december and early january

1552
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:55,360
right after new year's eve a shipment let's just put this way

1553
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,000
that machine right there will

1554
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
We'll definitely own. I mean, there's no doubt about it. 230 songs.

1555
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
The question is, how soon before it breaks? Our local golf land.

1556
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Golf land, man. It's going to be scandium, man.

1557
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And there's also another report, Aaron in Japan mentions that SHINE was triple-8 on heavy within two hours.

1558
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
By one of those insane Japanese dancers, Yosaku.

1559
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Of course, we don't want to obviously reveal to any Konami people that someone got pictures from the test location,

1560
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,700
someone did get pictures from Test Location, someone that's website we might be looking

1561
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:35,700
at right now, and supposedly they should be leaked out a couple weeks from now.

1562
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,700
Okay, cool.

1563
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,060
So we'll have to look for that.

1564
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:41,580
I don't really know if it's going to reveal anything, probably not, who cares.

1565
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,520
Probably it's just going to be more kind of screenshots, and I like those.

1566
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,820
When Max 2 was first out, they got a lot of up-close screenshots, that was pretty cool,

1567
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:49,220
I'm waiting for those kind of shots.

1568
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:52,580
There are people that have access to them, I don't have access to them because I'm not

1569
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:56,580
I'm not bored and I don't know Aaron, so obviously I can't get access to them.

1570
01:40:56,580 --> 01:41:01,580
He hasn't password protected, so there's no way for us to get him, unfortunately.

1571
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:05,580
Let's see what else is here, if there's any other exciting news to share.

1572
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:11,580
No new upgrade for the cabinet, like as posted a long time ago on Team Boilo.

1573
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:14,580
It's the same software, it should be an easy upgrade.

1574
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:17,580
They're saying that Speed Over Beethoven is the best new song.

1575
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,580
A lot of people are saying that.

1576
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,580
i think i can get that from one of the uh...

1577
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,580
i've heard it, it's uh...

1578
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,580
i can't remember, i'm not good at classical music

1579
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,580
it's on speed 9 isn't it?

1580
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,580
it's on speed 9

1581
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,580
it's on that one song, it's like

1582
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,580
ah shit, i can't remember, it's the one

1583
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,580
uh

1584
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,580
i don't remember it

1585
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:39,580
yeah, yeah, that one

1586
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,580
yeah, fairly

1587
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,580
yes

1588
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,580
it's a speed mix

1589
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,580
it's like happy hardcore type speed mix

1590
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:50,080
I'll see if I can get that for you guys and play it next week.

1591
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,580
I know somebody who has Speed 9.

1592
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,080
I know I have that song, so...

1593
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,580
Alright, we'll play that for you guys next week.

1594
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,080
I don't have it right now. Sorry, guys.

1595
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,080
If somebody in the chat room has it, feel free to send it to me.

1596
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,580
I'll play it before the end of the show.

1597
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,080
That's pretty much all that's up with DDR Extreme,

1598
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:08,580
other than the very girly shot picture of Naoki.

1599
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,580
You know, they have pictures from Teslocation.

1600
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:13,580
Oh, and Naoki's diary. We haven't talked about Naoki's diary.

1601
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:15,580
It was a filler. We really don't...

1602
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,080
It was a filler. It was nothing. There was nothing new.

1603
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,360
It was him bitching about more songs we don't really care about, and it was also talking

1604
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,360
about-

1605
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,800
Wow, wow, my life is so traumatic.

1606
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,560
They were interviewing some people that were working on it and asking him stupid questions

1607
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,280
like, what's your favorite character?

1608
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,720
Like our listless.

1609
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,120
Stupid things can only be done on this show.

1610
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:46,800
Listen up.

1611
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,440
I think we're going to take another quick break, and then we're going to wrap up this

1612
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:51,440
show.

1613
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,440
How's that sound?

1614
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,440
Oh, thank you.

1615
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,440
That was terrible.

1616
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,440
Yes, it was.

1617
01:42:55,440 --> 01:43:02,560
What shall we play in this break?

1618
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,560
Let's start off with...

1619
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:08,440
You want to hear Miracle Moon?

1620
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,680
Okay, let's hear Miracle Moon.

1621
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:11,680
Fair enough.

1622
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,280
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1623
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:20,280
be right back to wrap up the show

1624
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,280
You're the only one who has to go now

1625
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:20,280
And she could make the world a better place

1626
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:25,280
And she could make the world a better place

1627
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,280
I'm the king that came up

1628
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:32,280
Give me something I can do

1629
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,280
Do you believe in love?

1630
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,280
Yes, I do believe in love

1631
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,280
I'm the king that came up

1632
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:22,280
The only love I call to know You are the angel of my love

1633
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:30,280
It's got to be my heart Being beside you while I'm alone at all

1634
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:39,280
I wanna look closer to you, my love Until the day I die

1635
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,740
I'll be your everything

1636
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:45,160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

1637
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:48,420
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

1638
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,240
Don't you change your head, but I will be your man

1639
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,280
Don't want you now, gun, doesn't matter where you

1640
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,080
One and one is two

1641
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,700
Don't you be the crew

1642
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:00,780
Singing that love is what we have to do

1643
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:03,920
Hold your hand, we'll be together

1644
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,040
Cause it's yours and mine

1645
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:07,780
Forever we're in this world

1646
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:37,740
Okay, as promised, uh, we were able to get

1647
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:41,660
a copy of that Speed Over Beethoven song. Thank you very much to DDR Mike for saying

1648
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:45,340
that to me. We're going to play it for you right now. This is going to be a DDR Extreme.

1649
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,080
It'll be an edited down version. This is the full version though, so you guys can get a

1650
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:55,080
sample of it. This is Rose with Speed Over Beethoven.

1651
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:23,080
Let's open, let's open, let's open

1652
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:28,080
Let's open, let's open, let's open

1653
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:32,080
You think you're nice, you make me cry

1654
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,080
I need you back, to save my life

1655
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:38,080
Because again, I'm just really weak

1656
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,080
Listen to this song

1657
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,080
And I'm gonna keep you free

1658
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,080
You make me laugh, living your life

1659
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:48,320
I need you one love, yeah, love, yeah, oui, oui

1660
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,320
Music gonna save your life

1661
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:22,320
You're really weird, music's gonna save your life

1662
01:49:48,320 --> 01:50:10,320
We apologize for the awkward end to that Speed Over Beethoven song, but that was right out

1663
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:14,620
of a non-stop Speed 9 album that didn't have time to edit that together, because that just

1664
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:16,500
got sent to me.

1665
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,500
We hope you enjoyed that though.

1666
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:24,500
pretty cool song what you guys think of that? It was cool. It was good. La la la la la la

1667
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:31,500
la la la la la la la la la. I forgot the words. Beethoven! Beethoven! Beethoven! Was

1668
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:38,000
that supposed to be another like Waka Laka song or something? No. But it's not Jenny

1669
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:45,320
Rom. Beethoven! Beethoven! Beethoven! I think I kind of like that a little more than Beethoven's

1670
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:53,600
virus even a little bit just a little bit so what was that call that was more

1671
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,800
important than the show Brad I'm just kidding out here and I don't care I

1672
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,680
thought I put you on the spot we're winding down the end of the show here oh

1673
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,000
I'm sorry oh yeah I see you want to have a conversation this year while I try to

1674
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,040
do the show in this year that's fine that's fine I can do that anything else

1675
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,040
I wish you guys wanted to get out of your systems before the show was done.

1676
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Nope.

1677
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,040
No?

1678
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,480
There's no other things you guys want to talk about?

1679
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:25,880
Let's talk about... Yes.

1680
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,800
Irene said it, but it kind of didn't get picked up on the mic.

1681
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,760
What would you like to talk about, Saxirene?

1682
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,760
It's great.

1683
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:48,760
You can't relate sex to Bamani in any way, outside of erotic songs?

1684
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,840
Well, I'm sure you can.

1685
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,920
I think, like, they should, you know, how you were saying about the announcer, you know,

1686
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:59,160
relating it to, like, a guy juicing or whatever, and if you fail a song, you just say, oh,

1687
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,160
well, premature ejaculation happens.

1688
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:05,160
I think that would be funny if the answer said that.

1689
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,160
Yeah, okay, here you go.

1690
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,160
This is it! This is my money shot!

1691
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:13,160
Ugh!

1692
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:16,160
69 combo!

1693
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:19,160
Oh yeah!

1694
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:27,160
Weren't we talking about that a couple weeks ago when we said the name of the mix was going to be Extreme, DDR Extreme, we were talking about DDR Sextreme?

1695
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,180
well that was a scandia where we're talking about whether we're gonna have

1696
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:31,140
a poll in the middle of the pad

1697
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:33,200
yeah and all the erotic songs

1698
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,000
yeah so that's really a sixty nine combo slate

1699
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,040
all dot

1700
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,240
yeah like that

1701
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,800
it's really terrible

1702
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,880
and they were like

1703
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,480
they're doing that we're going to like uh...

1704
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,520
uh... uh...

1705
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:49,940
but uh... you know

1706
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:54,720
because you know yet

1707
01:52:54,720 --> 01:53:00,740
i don't know how

1708
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:04,120
what is showing right down the toilet real fast didn't

1709
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:09,520
uh... yeah right when we said that this is orange lambs real uh...

1710
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,580
people is there is uh...

1711
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:15,080
yet

1712
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,200
uh...

1713
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:20,120
that

1714
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:24,000
he said

1715
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:00,280
pretty scandalous stuff in that. Uh, not really. I mean, it's not too bad. It's a pretty, it's

1716
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:05,400
a stylish film, I would say. Like, a lot of stuff that's, like, backwards and weird shit

1717
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:09,520
going on there. Like, it starts in, you know, it's one of those movies that starts in the

1718
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,520
middle of the movie and then goes back and then comes to the middle again and then goes

1719
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:19,440
forward. Okay, I saw, uh, The Transporter on, I think, Saturday. That was pretty good.

1720
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:20,520
and

1721
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:24,540
what yeah i want for that but it's like the guy there is like the master

1722
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:28,360
that i heard that movie was a piece of shit but i was just what i heard

1723
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,520
where from

1724
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,680
they're not sure what the people that

1725
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,040
right up there to me

1726
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,760
well i think that you guys went so spirit away that's of interest to a lot

1727
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:38,120
of your people on

1728
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:41,920
you said but i want to transfer sex but you like showgirls

1729
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,200
but i'd like to know girls permits comic value

1730
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,860
there is much comic value we have showgirls

1731
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:51,860
It was really funny on TV where they tried to censor all the boobies.

1732
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:52,860
Oh, the VH1.

1733
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,860
Yes, you have to see Showgirls on VH1.

1734
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:57,860
Don't see Showgirls for the first time on VH1, but watch it for the second time on VH1.

1735
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:58,860
Where they have to...

1736
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,860
Follow your Showgirls DVD?

1737
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,860
You sure can, honey.

1738
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:02,860
You ruined the effect of the...

1739
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,860
Yes you can, darlin'.

1740
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:04,860
...insult.

1741
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,860
Oh yes, tell us about Spirited Away.

1742
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,860
Now, was the dub as crappy as the sub?

1743
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:11,860
What?

1744
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:12,860
That's what I want to know.

1745
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:13,860
I mean, I was being...

1746
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:14,860
Was it crappier than the sub?

1747
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:15,860
I'm sorry.

1748
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,860
Spirited Away was a great movie.

1749
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:17,860
I just want to know if they fucked up the dub.

1750
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:43,860
I personally used to, when Princess Mononoke came out here in America and I went and saw it in the theaters, I was saying that it was the greatest dub so far. There was nothing as good. This, in my opinion, is better. There's no annoying Claire Danes. But seriously, the dub is great. Everybody does a great job. There's no overacting in it at all.

1751
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,060
um...

1752
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,780
and it didn't change anything that didn't need to be changed the names

1753
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,940
are premature they're all the same

1754
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:54,900
there are a couple jokes thrown in that weren't in the original but they were

1755
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,120
funny and they made

1756
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,920
they didn't ruin it

1757
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:03,960
airbase should really go see that movie is as good as i thought subversion is

1758
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,380
excellent

1759
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:09,300
when the best films and if you don't make it for all you people who don't

1760
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,620
know

1761
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:16,620
I know a lot of people listening will know, but I was feeling a lot of the parents in the theater were like Disney, it's a Disney movie, yeah.

1762
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,620
And then Studio G, I was like, oh God, I'm talking to myself about it.

1763
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:25,620
It was Miyazaki who made the movie, that's what he was trying to say.

1764
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:29,620
Alright, I also saw part of Initial D, the anime series, after playing the game.

1765
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:32,620
Dude, that anime rocks.

1766
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:35,620
Hello and welcome to last week.

1767
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:38,660
I'd like to mention something, it's video game related.

1768
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:44,580
I just heard that they're making a sequel to Final Fantasy X, which is pretty interesting.

1769
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:50,700
Okay, now from what I hear, from what I hear, in the U.S., those two sequels that they're

1770
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:55,900
making to Final Fantasy X, there's a Unistory and there's a, what's the other chick, the

1771
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:56,900
Riku.

1772
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:00,220
There's a Unistory and a Riku story, and in Japan, those are going to be released as separate

1773
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:04,500
games, FF10, 1 and 2, and please keep in mind my word is not gospel, I'm just spreading

1774
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:07,380
dirty rumors I've heard so if I'm wrong then whatever.

1775
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:08,380
I've seen screenshots.

1776
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,260
Well, no, no, I know they exist but this is the thing, this is the thing.

1777
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:15,020
You know how Final Fantasy XI, it's online in Japan and it's kind of been a bit of a

1778
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:18,660
wreck because they've had a lot of problems with the servers, they've had a problem with

1779
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:21,980
the, they won't release the hard drives here in America so there's really no way they're

1780
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:26,340
going to be able to release Final Fantasy XI in America and playing online games in

1781
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:30,600
America is kind of, I don't know, I don't know any online game I've ever seen that people

1782
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,540
take it seriously, except EverQuest, which is where people take it way too seriously,

1783
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:38,160
so I think Final Fantasy Online in America would kind of be stupid anyway.

1784
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:39,160
Ultima Online.

1785
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:42,920
But, what's going to happen, since they can't do it on the Playstation 2 because they have

1786
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,620
no hard drive, they're going to release it on the computer. It's Final Fantasy Online.

1787
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:50,500
Final Fantasy XI here in America is going to be those side stories. They're going to

1788
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:53,140
release them as one game here in America. That's just what I've heard.

1789
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:58,780
But what's really strange about it is, Yuna looks like frickin' Lara Croft. She's got

1790
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:02,540
I got two pistols

1791
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:05,460
I don't know, it's just weird

1792
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:09,900
She's carrying forbidden machina? What's wrong? She's violating the teachings

1793
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:16,140
I think she said screw the teachings in Final Fantasy X the first place, and that and supposedly machina has taken over

1794
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:20,180
Spoiler free show please, spoiler free show, I haven't really played through X

1795
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,620
Alright

1796
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:24,220
Well, yeah, exactly, thank you

1797
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:31,220
taking over Spira is after 10 anyway, so it has nothing to do with 10.

1798
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:35,740
Spoiler free show please that includes you people in the chat room. God damn, so not

1799
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:40,200
everybody's finished the game yet. Some of us are just now getting our USPS2. Some of

1800
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:45,200
us wasted all their money buying a Japanese PS2 and can't afford to get an American one.

1801
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:51,000
Yeah, and those people play 2DX, so they suck.

1802
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You don't know me. Sit down. Talk to the hand.

1803
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I'm sitting.

1804
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah.

1805
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Other than that, there's also, supposedly, they're selling now an international PS2.

1806
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It plays both U.S. and Japanese games.

1807
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
What? I don't believe that.

1808
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I don't know. It's on YesAsia.

1809
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Oh, no. You know what is tricky? I saw that it's just the way they worded it.

1810
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Go back and read it very carefully. It's not an all-region DVD. They just try to make it sound like that.

1811
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Alright.

1812
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
If I'm wrong, then fuck them.

1813
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Alright, we're running a little over. I want to finish up the last show. Final thoughts. Any final thoughts from you, Loki?

1814
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Check on my site if you haven't yet. It's www.leechfromloki.tk

1815
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Alright, any final thoughts from Dave?

1816
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Go watch Initial D. It is cool.

1817
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Cool.

1818
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,400
Any final thoughts from Brad?

1819
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:50,240
Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't done?

1820
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:51,480
My bad.

1821
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,080
My final thought is that I am done now.

1822
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,600
Okay, thank you.

1823
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,000
Has to go.

1824
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,800
Any final thoughts from you, Mr. Brad?

1825
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:05,040
It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.

1826
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,040
All right, thank you.

1827
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,040
Any final thoughts from you, Ari?

1828
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,040
Bye.

1829
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,040
Bye, that's it?

1830
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,400
Oh, okay, fair enough.

1831
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,760
My final thought is that we're going to be doing, after the show tonight, we're going

1832
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,960
I'm gonna stay live, we're not gonna deconnect the stream

1833
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:21,540
we're not gonna be here talking, in fact most of us will be gone

1834
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:24,960
but we're just gonna play some music, we're gonna play all 2DX music

1835
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,440
all night long, until I feel like shutting it off

1836
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:30,160
so you can go ahead and stick with the stream after this show is done

1837
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,500
that's what we're gonna be doing, gonna be playing 2DX all night long

1838
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:37,160
every single style, 2nd through 8th every track that I've got

1839
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:40,120
Which is everything except I don't think I have all THE 8th

1840
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:41,700
I've got just about everything

1841
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:45,200
So we're gonna play 2DX music all night long until I feel like shutting it off

1842
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,080
Enjoy that, you guys.

1843
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:47,580
That's it.

1844
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,040
That's all I've got to say for now.

1845
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,160
So good night, everybody.

1846
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,700
