00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:29.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now. Boring!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
This video stops!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
See, they've been so nasty.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult partners.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
One.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
One.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
He's good.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Mished it by that much.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's Dr. Evils cat.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
How can you tell?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'll never forget a pussy.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Cat.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Thirty-seven.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
In a row?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Shh! And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
You are the weakest link goodbye.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Till you get nothing!

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
You lose!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Good day sir!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Dear Diary,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
My teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Dark Sakura.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Skye.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Everything alright?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
We are live and this is episode number 17 for...

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
You okay there?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You need some Nyquil there.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Capital N, small i, big fucking Q.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
This is episode number 17 for October the 27th of 2002.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
You need some Robitussin. Robitussin! Robitussin!

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
I almost said that on the pre-show list, except I don't have an editor to cut out all the talk to get me in.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most shy-and-get radio station of all things Bimani.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
My name is Rob Roberts, be you might know me as Sky.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
You know her better, it starts out...

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Are you talking like, out of her box?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
No.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Jamie is recovering from ikitas.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
We have a whole studio filled with guests, let's say hello to our guests!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Actually, they're not even really guests anymore, they're just, they're always here.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They're the back legs of the show, literally.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
They're our mascot, they're our dancing girls.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Because they sit behind us, so the back legs of the show.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Say hello to Loki!

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm the uncredited member of this show.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You're the guy behind the curtain.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Exactly.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Do not stare behind the curtain.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Nothing to see here, move along.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
And also Dave, say hello to Dave.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm just a guy.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm just a guy.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You know that No Doubt song, I'm just a girl?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
No.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
But you can just, I'm just a, you know.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Maybe he really is just a girl.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.280
it's one of those evenings

03:39.280 --> 03:41.860
we'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later but first gonna take a

03:41.860 --> 03:43.120
quick break

03:43.120 --> 03:45.320
with some songs that we want to play for you

03:45.320 --> 03:49.380
we have to take the children out for a walk

03:49.380 --> 03:53.920
any other opening thoughts from you Jamie?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.640
I'm mad at you

03:55.640 --> 03:57.900
oh shit

03:57.900 --> 03:59.880

04:10.800 --> 04:14.880
orange allowed to start this off at a high note

04:14.880 --> 04:15.960
i have never

04:15.960 --> 04:20.960
heard you crack that high of an octave i a mighty impressed

04:20.960 --> 04:25.500
i have a pretty impressive range but i think you should go kick polteri's ass

04:25.500 --> 04:27.800
you could sing i was you could take a dive

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
I will just take my saxophone tape and beat around with it.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.040
thing because Jamie's got a lot she was to say and I'm very very scared what

05:02.040 --> 05:09.040
else can I say? I can only hope. We'll see you in a little bit. Later.

10:02.040 --> 10:30.480
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song orange lounge radio you

10:30.480 --> 10:34.340
you are listening to or in times radio

10:34.340 --> 10:37.840
episode number seventeen health and then we are just a catch-up was when i told

10:37.840 --> 10:39.340
you about the new program

10:39.340 --> 10:41.340
as well today to dance

10:41.340 --> 10:42.880
you know that

10:42.880 --> 10:47.640
it's the new macarena

10:47.640 --> 10:50.400
in

10:50.400 --> 10:54.320
you leave for a week and it's just everything is going to help the hell

10:54.320 --> 10:55.760
but

10:55.760 --> 10:58.920
and you know on top of that i'm missing make a boy action okay

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
I missed YowieCon, and I was there.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.920
Okay, tell us all about what you were leaving for...

11:04.920 --> 11:08.920
What the hell? Somebody's sending their alarm right outside my window. Anyway...

11:08.920 --> 11:15.920
Tell everybody about why you left last weekend, what the plan was that you were going to be gone for, and what ended up making you late, and all that.

11:15.920 --> 11:20.920
I was going to go to YowieCon, because I wanted to go buy doujinshi. Because, dammit, I'm a nerd.

11:20.920 --> 11:26.920
So, Julie says, okay, well we're going to leave in the morning, after my class. So will they cancel her class?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.920
It doesn't matter though because Julie still didn't get to my house until six in the evening.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.920
Describe yaoi for everybody who may not know.

11:33.920 --> 11:40.920
You know what, I'd have to get the exact terminology because the word yaoi is actually combinations of parts of three different words.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.920
And right now I'm too brain dead to actually remember what they mean.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
But it's basically...

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
Gay porn.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
No, it's not.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
It has also to do with, you know, the...

11:52.920 --> 11:55.920
Man love.

11:55.920 --> 12:00.920
You know there's actually a street in Sacramento called Man Love?

12:00.920 --> 12:05.920
Yeah, I drove by there and I was like, well, that's pretty cool.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.920
Okay.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.920
I think Dark Tetsuya lives by Man Love.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.920
Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying.

12:11.920 --> 12:16.920
Anyway, I was going to go to YowieCon so I could, you know, look at all the pretty art

12:16.920 --> 12:21.920
and watch the pretty anime and see the pretty boys and, you know, see cosplayers and stuff.

12:21.920 --> 12:27.920
and stuff. So we get there and we decide that it's late so we go to Pacific East Mall. It's

12:27.920 --> 12:32.320
not in Berkeley but near Berkeley. Wait, do cosplayers for Yowie dress up as naked men

12:32.320 --> 12:41.420
or something? No! God. Anyway, so I go and I have this chat with this really nice guy

12:41.420 --> 12:49.880
there about the Trueno because I want one. For people who have no knowledge of Toyotas

12:49.880 --> 12:56.360
or Initial D, basically it was the Corolla in Japan, and I want one. I actually liked

12:56.360 --> 13:02.040
the car before I ever heard of the Automate. But anyway, we ended up just hanging out,

13:02.040 --> 13:07.720
we went to go, oh, your horn works, you whore!

13:07.720 --> 13:11.160
For those, if it's us not picking up over our microphone, somebody's honking the horn

13:11.160 --> 13:18.160
quite obnoxiously outside. Oh, Jamie's gonna go do something about it!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.960
God, I hope the mic picked that up. Jamie just went over to the window and went,

13:23.960 --> 13:27.600
SHH! We're trying to do a show!

13:27.600 --> 13:31.040
Anyway,

13:31.040 --> 13:34.800
we go hang out at Krista's house. Actually, we went to San Francisco and picked up Krista,

13:34.800 --> 13:38.280
who was working the convention with a Japanese guest.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
What?

13:39.280 --> 13:48.600
The people outside are screaming, this is, okay.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
We just heard the N-word.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
Away from the bad radio.

13:51.600 --> 14:02.360
Anyway, we drove all over San Francisco, we ate at Mizune in the Kintetsu Mall, went back,

14:02.360 --> 14:06.680
crashed out, got up the next day with the full intention of spending the $30 to get

14:06.680 --> 14:10.760
into the convention so we could go shopping in the dealer's room, and oh, don't forget,

14:10.760 --> 14:12.760
pay $15 to park.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.760
I hate that.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.520
Frisco can go to hell and die for costing so much to park in.

14:16.520 --> 14:20.040
Well, we went all over the place, and Julie and I sat back and we went, you know what,

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
fuck that.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.480
We decided not to go to YowieCon.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.320
So we went all over the place and spent a bunch of money instead, and then we walked

14:27.320 --> 14:28.960
Krista's dog in Berkeley.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.880
We get back, we decided that we were going to go to Network Video because we thought

14:31.880 --> 14:32.880
we had time.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.440
We didn't realize that we got back at five.

14:34.440 --> 14:39.040
video being the local import video game store? Local meaning Bay Area.

14:39.040 --> 14:44.620
We had an hour to get there, so we get in the car, and we're on our way to network video.

14:44.620 --> 14:50.000
We get stuck in evil traffic going into San Francisco. It took us an hour just to get

14:50.000 --> 14:56.660
past the toll booth from Berkeley to there. I call Rob at, oh what, six something? Rob,

14:56.660 --> 15:03.660
guess what, we're in traffic at the toll booth, going into San Francisco. So finally, you

15:03.660 --> 15:10.160
You know that really weird phone call where you know, I couldn't hear anything that was me calling from Mifune again over my oyako donburi

15:11.180 --> 15:17.320
Which was really yummy, by the way, and it got back like evil late and that was it because after

15:17.900 --> 15:19.900
We went shopping before we ate

15:20.300 --> 15:22.980
So if you could sum up the weekend in one word, that would be

15:26.740 --> 15:31.160
I ran into people in the hallway outside of

15:31.160 --> 15:32.160
the

15:32.160 --> 15:34.300
you could be a enjoying a nap there loki

15:34.300 --> 15:38.280
but i'm very happy because i thought that i think it will be the bible

15:38.280 --> 15:39.000
volume three

15:39.000 --> 15:40.080
uh... cool

15:40.080 --> 15:43.100
paid eighteen bucks worth of its president thirty on ebay

15:43.100 --> 15:47.140
and uh... went into a jacket there jay kinetic you know what my friend bought

15:47.140 --> 15:48.080
on ebay

15:48.080 --> 15:50.000
what a golden girls poster

15:50.000 --> 15:51.080

15:51.080 --> 15:52.560
that's what i can tell

15:52.560 --> 15:55.920
uh... i think all the girls and i always think of them sitting on the table

15:55.920 --> 15:57.260

15:57.260 --> 16:00.980
yes student i want to go to girls poster and i want to change it in my

16:00.980 --> 16:12.020
My Fuck You of the Week goes toward JJ North's Cheesecake today.

16:12.020 --> 16:15.580
It's like a hometown buffet.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.060
It sounds like a clothing store.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.180
For people that are back east, it's also like the Piccadilly, basically.

16:21.180 --> 16:25.420
Well, not necessarily like Piccadilly, because that's more of a cafeteria-type place.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.420
It's basically a big buffet.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.420
You know, just all kinds of crappy food that's been sitting out for five hours.

16:30.420 --> 16:36.420
I hadn't eaten at JJ North's in forever, and Waffle Square, OK, damn them, they were busy.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.420
That should be Chicken and Waffle Square.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.420
Full of old people.

16:39.420 --> 16:46.420
So, we decided to go to JJ North's because I was actually feeling good today, because I went home early Friday because I was sick, as you can't tell from my...

16:46.420 --> 16:48.420
Anyway, that was gross.

16:48.420 --> 16:52.420
So I go, and I'm all happy because the food sucked and I want a cheesecake.

16:52.420 --> 16:57.420
I eat a cheesecake and it tastes like the meringue topping from a lemon meringue pie. It was really gross.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.420
And so, that sucked.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.420
The second fuck you of the week goes to Rob.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.420
Hey!

17:03.420 --> 17:07.420
Christina, slutty-era stuff behind my back on Friday.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.420
You bitch.

17:08.420 --> 17:15.420
For those that don't know, our chat room, Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side, IRC server, was crowded as fucking hell on Friday.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.420
It was almost like having a show, it was very random.

17:17.420 --> 17:20.420
So they got in there and said, Sky, go live, play some requests.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.420
So I did.

17:21.420 --> 17:25.420
And we went on there and played some, uh, we were playing a bunch of dirty songs in a row.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.160
We played like I can yell put it in my mouth and we play I think we played how many licks

17:29.160 --> 17:34.920
I don't remember what else we played. We played like a bunch of really. Oh, we played that legend the legend song the Zelda rap

17:34.920 --> 17:38.320
You know, I'm about right. I'll have to play that tonight for our regular listeners

17:40.100 --> 17:41.160
Oops

17:41.160 --> 17:47.080
We're still on yours. Anyway, yeah and to intro the dirty songs. I played dirty, but it was a

17:47.600 --> 17:51.480
It was a chat room that made me play the full version specifically. It was bite my ass

17:51.480 --> 17:54.480

You're sick of being sick?

18:29.240 --> 18:41.240
Uh, yeah. Um, and my other fuck you leak goes toward, um, um, Contra Shattered Soldier because it was really loud and I wanted to go to bed last night.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.240
Fair enough.

18:43.240 --> 18:49.240
Which, oh, everybody's gonna be hearing about that later, because it's Konami and damn it, I say so.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.240
Okay. Do we have any other FUs of the Week in the house?

18:52.240 --> 18:54.240
Um, next.

18:54.240 --> 19:01.240
Let's move on to Dave. Oh, Loki's next. Yes, Loki! Oh, wait, I gotta find Loki's music.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.240
LOKI'S MUSIC!

19:31.240 --> 19:38.080
my website. Yeah, so, uh, F you to my stupid headache. And also F you to the stupid movie

19:38.080 --> 19:44.360
Transporter. God damn it, that movie is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. It is a waste

19:44.360 --> 19:51.620
of your time. Seriously, it doesn't have any redeeming parts of it at all. It's just crap.

19:51.620 --> 19:57.500
Crap Disguise is like a good action movie. And also, uh, uh, actually another F you to

19:57.500 --> 20:02.400
into a movie that's going to be coming out. Extreme Ops. Extreme Sports and Spies do

20:02.400 --> 20:10.400
not mix. Stop trying to do that. What was Triple X? It was Vin Diesel. Oh, he's a beef

20:10.400 --> 20:17.080
cake, so it's okay. It was, hey, this is Fast and the Fierce as a spy. That's what it was.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.640
Extreme Ops is a... It's a bald James Bond. Extreme Ops, they're like... A bald, fat

20:20.640 --> 20:24.680
James Bond. These people happen to go up to this, like, lodge, and, oh, there happens

20:24.680 --> 20:46.680
it be a terrorist base in this lodge? Who would've thought that there's a terrorist base in this lodge? Wow, what are the odds of that? Oh, it's one of the most notorious criminals, too. Ooh, who would've thought that? What are the odds of that happening? Sorry, could you repeat that for our audience?

20:46.680 --> 20:51.680
I'm sorry, were you finished?

20:51.680 --> 20:56.680
Uh, yes I'm finished.

20:56.680 --> 21:01.680
Dave's turn!

21:01.680 --> 21:06.680
Is this my music?

21:06.680 --> 21:11.680
Okay, I don't really have much of a fuck you.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.920
for being really long

21:13.920 --> 21:16.260
oh it's giants are one

21:16.260 --> 21:19.940

21:23.500 --> 21:27.340
yeah on with the fuck yous

21:27.340 --> 21:33.060
fuck you weekdays for having five of them compared to only two weekend days

21:33.060 --> 21:34.700
because weekends are cool

21:34.700 --> 21:38.300
and weekdays are shit because there is school or work for whoever has work

21:38.300 --> 21:40.280
you know what

21:40.280 --> 21:45.280
and all of you people in japan are lucky because women get one p m s day a month

21:45.280 --> 21:47.320
to call in sick

21:47.320 --> 21:49.760
we need that in america

21:49.760 --> 21:54.760
so that i don't have to picture people at work and i can stay at home and bitch

21:54.760 --> 21:58.260
okay that's it

21:58.260 --> 22:00.160
uh... no i get one

22:00.160 --> 22:04.760
i get one

22:04.760 --> 22:06.200
my fuck you the week

22:06.200 --> 22:12.580
is the fact that drinking inhibits one's abilities to drive.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.840
No, I didn't do anything stupid.

22:14.840 --> 22:20.460
But last night I went out to the local bar, the local number one bar,

22:20.460 --> 22:22.920
and I was the designated driver.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.800
And my two friends I was with were the designated drunks.

22:26.800 --> 22:32.420
When I'm drunk I have a lot more fun, but no, I have to drive, so I can't do any drinking.

22:32.420 --> 22:35.520
i didn't stop me from having a uh... pebble shot we first got there which by

22:35.520 --> 22:39.000
the way is uh... red bull mixed with malibu very good stress and i'm

22:39.000 --> 22:42.300
but of course is out there for four hours was the color of death

22:42.300 --> 22:44.800
and it smells like pussy what's your point

22:44.800 --> 22:47.620
okay

22:47.620 --> 22:48.860
so uh...

22:48.860 --> 22:52.300
it took uh... it we were there for four hours so i was ready to agree that

22:52.300 --> 22:55.900
template and get out of the system of a two friends

22:55.900 --> 22:59.100
when they get very drunk they're bold as hell is just you know i have a lot of

22:59.100 --> 23:01.960
fun a lot a lot of fun and uh... i uh...

23:01.960 --> 23:06.960
I had fun, but I was just kind of just sitting there, kind of, yeah, I'm the driver.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Wee.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.960
But my costume owned.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.960
I don't know if you guys saw my costume, did you see my costume on my journal?

23:12.960 --> 23:16.960
I saw that, that was pretty cool, it was a milk box with the missing and then it went

23:16.960 --> 23:17.960
on your head.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.960
Yeah, so it was a big hat, it was a big milk cart and it says missing and it has my head

23:20.960 --> 23:21.960
in it.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.280
And I'm sure somebody will post a picture in the chat room, somebody will post a link

23:24.280 --> 23:25.960
to the picture of my Halloween costume.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.480
I just had 24 traffic covers fresh on me.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.480
So my FU is towards DUIs.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.480
Do people need to come and help me make my costume?

23:35.480 --> 23:38.480
Cause I've been lazy. I've had the stuff to make my costume now.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.480
For what? A month?

23:41.480 --> 23:44.480
I haven't made it. So fuck my costume.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.480
Let's get to the chatroom FUs.

23:48.480 --> 23:53.480
JB says, FU to nobody buying me the new Jenny Rom single, Ika Uka.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.480
Actually, I don't know if that's new. I just said it was.

23:55.480 --> 24:14.480
f you to his math book for having a Spanish glossary or whatever. It made him mad because I couldn't find the English one.

24:14.480 --> 24:26.480
SoCalKick says, Fuck you Weekend for being boring as fuck and Funk you Sky for superliminally making me expose myself.

24:26.480 --> 24:31.480
He exposed himself in the chatroom.

24:31.480 --> 24:37.480
He pulled down his pants and made us cry.

24:37.480 --> 24:50.480
Twen says, FU did his arcade for having to send the DDR boards and kit to some guy to get it upgraded to Max 2.

24:50.480 --> 24:55.480
FU to never being able to get on early enough because of his damn mother.

24:55.480 --> 25:03.480
FU to GJ Bad Sight for going completely down for the past two days.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.480
He has a super secret message for Loki, and then F you to people who watch baseball.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.480
Actually, DJ Bad's site isn't down.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.480
Just the download section is.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.480
He has his Geocities site still up, though.

25:15.480 --> 25:19.480
And I don't watch baseball. My parents do, and they're all like,

25:19.480 --> 25:23.480
Yeah, it's 4 to 1 Angels, or whatever. Actually, they like the guys.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.480
Anyway, that's not the point. The point is I don't watch it.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.480
But Loki seems to like it.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.480
Can I continue?

26:00.480 --> 26:06.480
Fuck! I just typed, yay, this porno is almost done downloading to this chick I like.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.480
Fucking wrong instant message windows. Ugh, I've so ruined my chances with her.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.480
That's why you say, ha ha ha ha, that was funny.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.480
That's a ha ha joke.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.480
Want to come over and watch?

26:18.480 --> 26:24.480
That's like that cable, or what was it, that beer commercial or something like that where the woman comes over.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.480
Hey, is this the adult channel?

26:25.480 --> 26:28.480
Well, I guess it is.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.480
And then they advertise the beer or something like that.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.480
Why is that a bad thing?

26:50.480 --> 26:52.480
Because we have to choose.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.880
That's true. You have to choose.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.380
Okay.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.880
I want the boy kind.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.680
Dude, that'd be cool.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.480
Dude, I don't...

26:58.480 --> 26:59.280
Transforming.

26:59.280 --> 26:59.880
Hello Kitty.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.280
Dude, you win.

27:03.780 --> 27:05.980
Dude, anyway.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.080
And BlackLap says,

27:08.980 --> 27:14.580
F you, number one, to fuck this 1600 award paper that is due tomorrow that he hasn't started on yet.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.180
Whoops.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.080
Fuck his roommate for missing his train at 8 a.m. Saturday,

27:19.080 --> 27:26.080
thus ruining his chances for a peaceful weekend to myself.

27:26.440 --> 27:30.080
Fuck his roommate again for bringing home some girl last night and making out until all

27:30.080 --> 27:32.940
hours of the morning while I was still in the room.

27:32.940 --> 27:37.100
Yeah, you don't do that shit with your roommate in there.

27:37.100 --> 27:39.300
And you don't do that shit with your roommate.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.900
I lived in a dorm room, hello.

27:41.900 --> 27:46.100
You do not have people over making out in the dorm room when your roommate is there.

27:46.100 --> 27:53.100
you pay your roommates to go play at the arcade unless he's really hot and swings that way

27:55.460 --> 27:57.120
you still go somewhere else to make out

27:57.120 --> 27:59.320
it's courteous

27:59.320 --> 28:01.220
i don't want to listen to two people

28:01.220 --> 28:06.220
sucking on each other unless i'm allowed to participate

28:06.220 --> 28:11.740
you know you feel left out

28:11.740 --> 28:18.740

28:20.360 --> 28:23.600

28:27.640 --> 28:29.120

29:23.500 --> 29:26.340
let's hear it for animal crossing

29:26.340 --> 29:28.060
i have been coming home

29:28.060 --> 29:32.200
worrying about my virtual mortgage and how the hell i'm going to pay it off

29:32.200 --> 29:35.740
with fish and bugs

29:35.740 --> 29:39.540
Tom Nook is an asshole, and I want Mallory to move out of my village.

29:39.540 --> 29:44.180
The fucking duck bitch needs to move, and I hate that bitch Phyllis at night in the post office.

29:44.180 --> 29:45.460
Oh my god, she just needs to-

29:45.460 --> 29:47.740
They need to gut her.

29:47.740 --> 29:49.900
Just do her over an open fire.

29:49.900 --> 29:53.300
You're talking about a video game, might I remind you? Yes, I am.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.740
And dammit,

29:54.740 --> 29:59.940
Lobo is cool, because he's a big wolf, and he's up until three in the morning.

29:59.940 --> 30:01.780
But, fuck you Nintendo, and thank you.

30:01.780 --> 30:04.380
I love Animal Crossing, and I hate you bitches.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.380
But I need to play more Kingdom Hearts 2.

30:34.380 --> 30:35.780
Where have you been?

30:35.780 --> 30:42.060
Rob, yeah, fuck you, because you gave away your TVX controller for a night, so I couldn't

30:42.060 --> 30:43.060
play it.

30:43.060 --> 30:44.060
I honest probably-

30:44.060 --> 30:48.740
I always go in like 45 minutes into the show and play for about half an hour or 45 minutes.

30:48.740 --> 30:52.660
Yeah, like I have like $250, $300, I don't know.

30:52.660 --> 30:55.580
Dude, the controllers, you get them from 89 now.

30:55.580 --> 31:00.140
My next fuck you is, my fuck you goes to money, because I don't have enough money.

31:00.140 --> 31:04.820
I need more money because I can't afford a GameCube and I can't get Animal Crossing.

31:04.820 --> 31:08.260
And Jamie tells me how much fun it is and I get to see how she has all her cute little

31:08.260 --> 31:11.340
shirts and stuff and I can't play because I'm poor.

31:11.340 --> 31:18.260
He gets to listen to me yell at Mallory because she's a stupid bitch and yell at all the people.

31:18.260 --> 31:26.260
And then I did design the coolest outfit and it was inspired by my gothic and lolita bible.

31:26.260 --> 31:34.260
But anyway, um, I just had a silent moment. Thank you, Rob.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.260
You're welcome.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.260
Rob totally broke my concentration. Blame him for the train wreck. Fuck you, Rob.

31:39.260 --> 31:43.260
So when are you going to do your random shows?

31:43.260 --> 31:45.260
Okay, I'll buy you more orange balls.

31:45.260 --> 31:48.260
Oh yes, thank you, Jamie, for buying me big orange balls. I appreciate that.

31:48.260 --> 31:49.260
Big fluffy orange balls.

31:49.260 --> 31:53.260
I have some big fluffy squishy orange balls and I put them in my mouth before the show.

31:53.260 --> 32:00.420
Yes, he did but I didn't watch because I had cupcakes and I had snowballs so you perverts can you know

32:01.180 --> 32:03.180
Why do they call them snowball?

32:04.420 --> 32:06.420
Did you spit them into your girlfriend's mouth

32:13.180 --> 32:15.180
Yay random

32:17.160 --> 32:20.220
Go watch clerks all of you right now you poor deprived people

32:20.220 --> 32:24.260
I see my buddy Travis joining the chat room, so I want to say hello.

32:24.260 --> 32:25.460
I'm glad you're listening.

32:25.460 --> 32:26.460
That's so cool.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.020
I hope everything's going good for you in Texas.

32:29.020 --> 32:30.020
This is for you.

32:30.020 --> 32:40.860
The stars at night shine big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.

32:40.860 --> 32:42.940
That's the second Pee Wee reference I made tonight.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.860
That's pretty scary.

32:44.860 --> 32:48.020
When I yelled at the people across the street.

32:48.020 --> 32:55.060
Yes, the people across the street, by the way, have been quiet, because the thing is,

32:55.060 --> 32:59.020
I would have been inspired again by Animal Crossing, by taking my axe and treating them

32:59.020 --> 33:02.820
like a tree, and cutting them down.

33:02.820 --> 33:05.820
Are you saying that you would have chopped up their booty?

33:05.820 --> 33:10.100
Yes, the word of the night is booty.

33:10.100 --> 33:17.500
Anything associated with the booty, we say the ass, we say my baby mama.

33:17.500 --> 33:24.500
i could ask you what the word of the day is again okay

33:25.980 --> 33:32.980
anyway that is the word of the evening is

33:38.040 --> 33:41.420
although the raving was pretty fun

33:41.420 --> 33:44.740
tell us what was that remix we heard right before the show started that uh...

33:44.740 --> 33:45.660
mix of

33:45.660 --> 33:55.380
I went home after the rave show and decided, you know what, I don't have this song on my

33:55.380 --> 33:57.420
computer and I kind of want it.

33:57.420 --> 34:02.620
So I went on Kazalite, yay, because it's the only thing that will work with my firewall,

34:02.620 --> 34:09.420
and I went downloading one that was called Children of the Sandstorm, and it was a mix

34:09.420 --> 34:14.340
of children and sandstorm, as the name implies.

34:14.340 --> 34:18.060
cool but it's very well done it's very nice yes I actually like it better than

34:18.060 --> 34:24.520
the other versions of the song so speaking of sandstorm DDR max USA coming

34:24.520 --> 34:28.960
out this week it's tentatively Tuesday from what I am telling game stops are

34:28.960 --> 34:33.000
getting there we're hearing Monday Tuesday we're hearing all sorts of days

34:33.000 --> 34:36.960
basically an open demo in my purse and I mean shipping it out this week and

34:36.960 --> 34:40.040
whenever the stores get it they get it and then your grubby little hands can go

34:40.040 --> 34:43.160
buy it you know we could do during one of the later breaks what I put in my

34:43.160 --> 34:48.080
you know it's it's that's it's the demo you guys the same demo but it's safe to

34:48.080 --> 34:53.260
act right see it huh have you played that I haven't I haven't seen I played

34:53.260 --> 34:57.740
that I have the PlayStation magazine demo yeah I saw the demo to see you got

34:57.740 --> 35:01.220
it's pretty cool we can go out and hook it up we'll do that during one of the

35:01.220 --> 35:05.620
breaks huh basically well it's the newer version of the demo because I guess what

35:05.620 --> 35:08.260
happened is that the original PlayStation magazine demo was actually

35:08.260 --> 35:11.500
an older version of the demo and the arrows were all miss synced on two of

35:11.500 --> 35:13.780
The songs, isn't that nice?

35:13.780 --> 35:17.820
I was led to believe that that one actually has a little bit more on it since it's just

35:17.820 --> 35:18.820
a demo disc.

35:18.820 --> 35:19.820
No, we can go plug it in.

35:19.820 --> 35:20.820
Just DDR Max.

35:20.820 --> 35:23.260
We can go plug it in and see what happens.

35:23.260 --> 35:30.260
But lots of stuff on DDR Max USA, they just revealed this week, Electronic Gaming Monthly

35:30.260 --> 35:36.300
spilled the beans in their review that there is in fact an Oni mode in DDR Max USA.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.620
I think this is a really weird thing to have in a home version because most people haven't

35:40.620 --> 35:44.780
spent a hundred bucks on a ignition pad and most people don't have metal pads

35:44.780 --> 35:48.260
most people are playing with those ghetto little pads either you know the

35:48.260 --> 35:52.820
the what do they call them the beat stage pads or what are those things

35:52.820 --> 35:58.740
called the ghetto ones you can buy at Fry's what are those called the ass pad

35:58.740 --> 36:04.820
I don't know the ass pad you can buy these ass pads that's what most people

36:04.820 --> 36:11.820
play with

36:12.380 --> 36:14.460
uh... internet access

36:14.460 --> 36:15.860
uh...

36:15.860 --> 36:21.020
if the market show them to get that done

36:21.020 --> 36:23.480
did their both only surprise

36:23.480 --> 36:30.480
people by these booty s pads of fries

36:30.480 --> 36:35.840
Anyway, you play Oni mode on these really crappy pads, you're going to be halfway across

36:35.840 --> 36:39.780
the room by the time you finish, and there's no way you're going to be able to keep, you're

36:39.780 --> 36:43.560
not even going to be able to pass that, like, dumbed down for Americans Oni, the lesson

36:43.560 --> 36:47.140
Oni or whatever it's called, you're not even going to be able to pass that on most normal

36:47.140 --> 36:48.140
home pads.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.140
So it seems very odd to me.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.140
I thought they'd do non-stops.

36:50.140 --> 36:52.520
I thought we'd have non-stops, but I didn't think we'd have Oni.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
I have to admit I'm surprised.

36:53.520 --> 36:58.080
Well this is what we have on the back of the demo, though, for the DDR Max.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
Okay!

36:59.080 --> 37:02.380
From one of the images that has screen capture of the select list, we have Healing Vision

37:02.380 --> 37:07.780
Insertion Let the Beat Hit Em, Look to the Sky, Love Again Tonight, Midnight Blaze, Paranoia

37:07.780 --> 37:12.300
Evolution, Orion 78, this is over 70 songs.

37:12.300 --> 37:17.440
Yes, over 70 songs.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.260
From what I understand, both are in there.

37:20.260 --> 37:25.940
But that's just what's on the back of here, for all the people who were, well I'm actually

37:25.940 --> 37:28.820
reading a screen capture off the back of this.

37:28.820 --> 37:33.660
So those are just a few of the ones that I'm assuming this is taken from the working version.

37:33.660 --> 37:34.660
Let me see.

37:34.660 --> 37:37.980
I'm just reading this, let's see.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.520
Revolutionary to the Max.

37:39.520 --> 37:44.060
The evolution of the revolution is here with DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution.

37:44.060 --> 37:48.940
Get ready to experience maximum dancing with all new songs and game modes, high energy

37:48.940 --> 37:52.040
pulsating music, and stunning graphics.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.980
The ultimate dancing game is now revolutionary to the max.

37:55.980 --> 38:00.580
Dear Diary, that guy who wanted to be just like his sick was reading the back of the

38:00.580 --> 38:03.900
American version of Dance Stats Revolution.

38:03.900 --> 38:07.500
Just listening to his voice makes me all excited in special places.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.460
Love, Mauki.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.860
Yeah I'm reading that little mini song list they have on the back.

38:11.860 --> 38:14.100
This pretty much spoils half the list there.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.620
There's the Orion 7-8 Civ mix.

38:16.620 --> 38:20.180
So this just kind of confirms some more songs for you.

38:20.180 --> 38:22.940
Actually I think I've seen that screenshot before about a couple weeks ago.

38:22.940 --> 38:27.140
But we can also check that out during one of the breaks and see what's available on the demo.

38:27.140 --> 38:34.740
One thing, though, that I did note is that the demo disc is one of the blue CDs, which means it's not DVD.

38:34.740 --> 38:41.900
If the last release of Max is any indication, the one that came out for PS2 in Japan, it's also on a CD.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.180
So I'm sort of thinking that the new one's not going to be on a DVD.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.780
So we may be seeing video sacrifices.

38:47.780 --> 38:48.620
I'm not sure.

38:48.620 --> 38:52.860
Rob, I think it's going to be on DVD.

38:52.860 --> 39:00.860
Rob, I think that you should do the intro and be the announcer for the DDR Max, because you read a lot better than the announcer right now.

39:00.860 --> 39:06.860
Hey, Konami, if you're out there listening, I want to be the new announcer, so send me a letter or something. Shoot me an email.

39:06.860 --> 39:10.860
They should just get the guy from Ridge Racer to do it, because he sounds like the original announcer anyway.

39:10.860 --> 39:12.860
Send us an email, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

39:12.860 --> 39:15.860
I've got everything on camera so you can watch it again. You're the greatest.

39:15.860 --> 39:21.860
SoCalKicks is stamping his foot and insisting the DDR Max USA is on a DVD. It's confirmed, whatever that means.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.380
whatever that means they need to get uh... bobcat uh...

39:25.380 --> 39:27.460
bobcat goldthwaite yes

39:27.460 --> 39:31.980
the best ddr announcer

39:31.980 --> 39:36.220
and i think you fucked up

39:36.220 --> 39:40.660
is that

39:40.660 --> 39:41.960
you mean it

39:41.960 --> 39:46.420
uh... and the fact that

39:46.420 --> 39:49.760
who else is a good topic who else would be a good ddr announcer

39:49.760 --> 39:52.100
still can't be

39:52.100 --> 39:52.740
you can't

39:52.740 --> 39:57.640
lady at it have a quick pop

39:57.640 --> 40:00.020
without the email and answers

40:00.020 --> 40:00.620
charo

40:00.620 --> 40:01.580
kitty

40:01.580 --> 40:02.860
it's not a pro

40:02.860 --> 40:04.740
oh my god that is

40:04.740 --> 40:07.800
that dated you right there and that's like

40:07.800 --> 40:10.860
hollywood squares from the eighties is the only thing i ever remember seeing

40:10.860 --> 40:13.200
charle from jen rivers

40:13.200 --> 40:15.020
old jon rivers i'll be the best

40:15.020 --> 40:19.020
Oh my god, oh my god, can we talk? You're dancing? It's fucking awful.

40:19.020 --> 40:23.020
Oh my god. Talk to my daughter, Melissa.

40:23.020 --> 40:27.020
What are those shoes? You're wearing

40:27.020 --> 40:31.020
shoes with fire on them.

40:31.020 --> 40:35.020
Dude, my shoes kick ass. Don't talk about my burning feet.

40:35.020 --> 40:39.020
I can just imagine the various other

40:39.020 --> 40:43.020
announcers, like, you know, like

40:43.020 --> 40:58.020
Paulie Shore, or Keanu Reeves, or Mike Myers doing the coffee talk lady.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.020
You're dancing there?

40:59.020 --> 41:00.020
You're dancing?

41:00.020 --> 41:01.020
No.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.020
Now I'm eclipsed.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.020
Here's the topic.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.020
Here's the song.

41:04.020 --> 41:14.220
Dance Dance Revolution is neither dancing nor revolution, discussed.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.420
It would work.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.420
Oh my God.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.420
Call me up and talk about it.

41:18.420 --> 41:19.420
It's 555-4444.

41:19.420 --> 41:20.420
You're dancing?

41:20.420 --> 41:22.260
We'll talk no big whoop.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.260
It's like butter.

41:23.260 --> 41:24.260
You know, this song here.

41:24.260 --> 41:27.260
Why don't you dance to this Barbara song?

41:27.260 --> 41:30.700
I hope Bob would do it.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.740
Black Lab suggests Carrot Top.

41:32.740 --> 41:33.740
Oh my god!

41:33.740 --> 41:35.740
Down, down the center!

41:35.740 --> 41:39.260
Yes, down the center!

41:39.260 --> 41:44.740
Mr. T, I pity the food and don't play DDR.

41:44.740 --> 41:47.540
And who else would we have?

41:47.540 --> 41:48.540
Who else does a good one?

41:48.540 --> 41:49.660
How about the movie guy?

41:49.660 --> 41:50.660
The guy that does all the voice...

41:50.660 --> 41:51.660
Mr. Movie Phone.

41:51.660 --> 41:52.660
Oh!

41:52.660 --> 41:53.660
Who had Mr. Movie Phone?

41:53.660 --> 41:54.660
Hello!

41:54.660 --> 41:56.420
And thank you for playing DDR!

41:56.420 --> 41:59.820
If you would like to play, let them move! Press one now!

41:59.820 --> 42:01.500
Nobody presses one!

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
This song is rated R for Language and Nudity!

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
The only person who presses one would be...

42:05.500 --> 42:06.500
I'm doing the copy guy.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.500
I'm just going to do the copy guy.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
Alright! D.D.R.

42:09.500 --> 42:14.500
D.D.R. Making copies.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.500
Anyway, that was pretty funny.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
There's still more. I know there's more.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.500
Okay.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
Roseanne could be the female announcer.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.500
I can't even do Roseanne right now. I'm too strong.

42:25.500 --> 42:35.860
wrong with your dance? You suck. You dance like you're fat. No, Margaret chose mom. Margaret

42:35.860 --> 42:50.920
chose mom. Hold on! Louie Anderson. Your dancing is gay, but I'm not gay, I swear. Okay. I

42:50.920 --> 42:55.480
can't do it as good as Travis does. If I try to do Louie Anderson, I feel like I have to

42:55.480 --> 42:58.760
to throw back to him because he's the ultimate in Louie Anderson impersonating.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.920
Ms. Cleo! Yes, thank you!

43:01.920 --> 43:06.480
Oh, don't you know you get the first three minutes of Dancing Paws free? It's in the cards, it's in the cards.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.680
But you have to pay in advance.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.200
And send me all your money.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.160
Because I don't read tarot cards. I read data bills.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.840
Does Tarot have any suggestions?

43:16.840 --> 43:21.640
No, but DSCS says everyone go to Fry's because they have Max USA early.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.160
Well, poopy on Fry's. Too bad I already spent

43:25.160 --> 43:28.880
five bucks pre-ordering it somewhere else yes thank you and all of you people

43:28.880 --> 43:34.280
who did not reserve your copy at my fiance's game stop poopy on you

43:34.280 --> 43:37.040
unless you don't live in town

43:37.040 --> 43:39.000

43:39.000 --> 43:42.440
now everybody's going to run over there crap on that maybe they have it but that

43:42.440 --> 43:45.160
doesn't mean they're out on the shelves

43:45.160 --> 43:48.680
along with AT&T whose logo is the death star

43:48.680 --> 43:54.960

43:59.980 --> 44:04.860

44:04.860 --> 44:06.740
forget their money for a second

44:06.740 --> 44:11.660
jamie hates first-person shooters and i love metroid prime thank you

44:11.660 --> 44:14.300
and if they understand

44:14.300 --> 44:15.980
metroid pride is the best

44:15.980 --> 44:19.460
godly beautiful looking first-person shooter

44:19.460 --> 44:21.780
tell us more about it

44:21.780 --> 44:23.560

contra shattered soldier it's related because it's coming okay

44:46.220 --> 44:47.640
so i can talk about it

44:47.640 --> 44:49.920
against his fucking disgusting looking

44:49.920 --> 44:54.120
I walked downstairs with this blaring headache to watch them play the game

44:54.120 --> 44:56.540
and they're beating this bloody turtle

44:56.540 --> 44:58.600
up with these guns, they're shooting it to death

44:58.600 --> 45:02.600
then the head falls off, the thing turns around and it has this fetus face coming out of its ass

45:02.600 --> 45:06.080
I kid you not

45:06.080 --> 45:08.120
Alright, for anybody who's ever played

45:08.120 --> 45:09.440
Vampire Savior

45:09.440 --> 45:10.240
and knows the

45:10.240 --> 45:12.200
the fetus of god level

45:12.200 --> 45:16.480
the face looks like the fetus from the fetus of god level of Vampire Savior

45:16.480 --> 45:21.200
do doesn't suck i think that's a good sign i'm sorry so you said do suck so

45:37.480 --> 45:40.120
well back to contract

45:40.120 --> 45:43.360
yes i want to hear more about fetus ass babies

45:43.360 --> 45:48.360
It's a big turtle with a fetus growing out of its ass.

45:48.360 --> 45:53.360
You mean it's coming out of its booty?

45:53.360 --> 45:55.360
It vomits fire on you.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.360
Yo, we're going to go down and play Contra.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.360
We're going to shoot some shit up.

46:00.360 --> 46:07.360
There's this other shape that looks like it's inside of some type of muscle cavity

46:07.360 --> 46:10.360
that looks like it has sinews growing out of the top and bottom.

46:10.360 --> 46:13.360
It looks like the inside of skin, and it's dripping blood everywhere.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.360
That game is fucking disgusting, okay?

46:16.360 --> 46:19.360
And look, he's doing the happy pee-pee dance.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.360
Do you need us to go to break?

46:20.360 --> 46:23.360
The problem is, you know, with all these good games out,

46:23.360 --> 46:26.360
I'm going to be spending about $150 on games this week.

46:26.360 --> 46:31.360
And then the fact that I'm not going to work this week to play all these games, that's...

46:33.360 --> 46:36.360
You will get your chance to play Contra later.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.360
He's going yay.

46:38.360 --> 46:47.360
I don't know. I think the last good Contra I remember was the one that was on Super Nintendo, because didn't they release ones on PlayStation that really sucked?

46:47.360 --> 47:03.360
Yeah, and the one on Genesis, though, it was a decent game, but it was really hard. Although the first Contra, this is what's kind of funny. The first Contra, you know, the palm trees in the first stage? On the Japanese version, they were animated and the game had an intro. It was pretty neat.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.360
You know what really has me torn is that this week there's a couple of new albums coming out.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.360
There's the new Tori Amos albums coming out.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.360
Yes, everybody loves Tori Amos.

47:12.360 --> 47:14.360
I love being female.

47:14.360 --> 47:19.360
Especially me. I can't wait. I get to hear 20 more songs about somebody's vagina.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.360
No, I'm just kidding. She doesn't sing about her vagina.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.360
But most people assume that.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.360
But she says, eat my pussy.

47:24.360 --> 47:29.360
That's true. There is that recording I have where she told some guy at a concert to eat her pussy.

47:29.360 --> 47:35.360
And then God, what else comes out this week? I think there's another big album coming out, I can't remember.

47:35.360 --> 47:44.360
I never keep up with that. I'm busy stuck on my computer and playing DDR. Because I play to DDR.

47:44.360 --> 47:50.360
That new Dance Mania album? I don't know. I think it came out on Friday, actually.

47:50.360 --> 47:54.360
The inside of this is blue. With meat fire on it.

47:54.360 --> 47:59.360
I'm looking in the inside of my demo disc case because I finally opened it and I've had it for two weeks.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.360
You're just now looking at it?

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
Yes.

48:05.360 --> 48:10.360
Well, supposedly they ripped it out of the promo.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.360
Oh, I remembered what CD was coming out this week.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.360
What?

48:15.360 --> 48:16.360
No!

48:16.360 --> 48:18.760
uh...

48:18.760 --> 48:21.280
uh...

48:21.280 --> 48:27.240
okay i need to go vomit so we're going to break right now

48:27.240 --> 48:30.820
all right i'm going to regurgitate brought shoes

48:30.820 --> 48:33.480
i'm gonna get my ass beat during this next break

48:33.480 --> 48:34.760
uh... you said it

48:34.760 --> 48:41.760
well you know i'm going to get my booty

48:41.760 --> 48:48.760
Alright, we're going to go to break. I'm going to start this break with something that Dave's

48:49.820 --> 48:55.000
been begging me to play all night long. And it's going to make Jamie cry, but as long

48:55.000 --> 49:01.640
as we're on her bad side, hey. This song makes both me and Duran Duran cry. Hello.

49:01.640 --> 49:06.640
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

49:06.640 --> 49:24.640
I came in from the rainy first day on the other night

49:24.640 --> 49:37.640
Thought I heard you talking so fast I sit on the light of TV and you're waiting

49:37.640 --> 49:45.640
alone Still I can't escape the doorstep of you

49:45.640 --> 49:52.640
What has been through it all, crazy some say

49:52.640 --> 49:58.640
Where is the life that I recognize

49:58.640 --> 50:00.640
Gone away

50:00.640 --> 50:03.640
But I won't cry till yesterday

50:03.640 --> 50:07.640
There's an ordinary world

50:07.640 --> 50:13.640
Somehow I have to find

50:13.640 --> 50:27.640
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive

51:43.640 --> 51:48.640
upbeat music

51:48.640 --> 51:53.640
upbeat music

51:53.640 --> 51:58.640
upbeat music

51:58.640 --> 52:03.640
upbeat music

52:03.640 --> 52:08.640
upbeat music

52:38.640 --> 53:00.480
I don't wanna say I'm sorry

53:00.480 --> 53:05.480
Cause I know there's nothing wrong

53:05.480 --> 53:12.480
Don't be afraid, there's no need to worry

53:12.480 --> 53:19.480
Cause my feelings for you are still strong

53:19.480 --> 53:23.480
Hold me in your arms

53:23.480 --> 53:26.480

53:26.480 --> 53:33.480
Hold me in your arms, cause I need you so

53:33.480 --> 53:36.480

53:36.480 --> 53:41.480
There's something, something you wanna tell me

53:41.480 --> 53:43.480
I see it in your eyes

53:43.480 --> 53:47.480
There's something, that you hide from me

53:47.480 --> 53:49.480
Is there a reason why?

53:49.480 --> 53:54.480
There's something, something you wanna tell me

53:54.480 --> 54:01.480
I see it in your eyes There's something that you hide from me

54:24.480 --> 54:48.320
i don't wanna say i'm sorry cause i know there's nothing wrong

54:48.320 --> 54:55.320
Don't be afraid, there's no need to worry

Cause my feelings for you are still strong

55:01.320 --> 55:04.320

And never let me go

55:25.320 --> 55:28.320
Hold me in your arms

55:28.320 --> 55:34.320
Could not need you so I can see it in your eyes

55:34.320 --> 55:39.320
There is something, something you wanna tell me

55:39.320 --> 55:45.320

55:45.320 --> 55:52.320

55:52.320 --> 55:59.320
Tell me I see it in your eyes There's something there to hide from me

57:22.320 --> 57:48.320
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

57:48.320 --> 57:53.000
Go, let's go, right, go, pick up, let's go, let's go, right, go, there!

57:53.000 --> 57:58.280
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.160
And Jamie's throwing a fit because...

58:00.160 --> 58:01.440
They're raping my demo.

58:01.440 --> 58:05.240
There were no new songs in the demo, hadn't been in the old demo, which kind of...

58:05.240 --> 58:06.240
But they're synced.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.560
They are synced.

58:07.560 --> 58:08.560
In sync.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.560
They are in sync.

58:09.560 --> 58:10.560
In sync.

58:10.560 --> 58:11.560
Bye, bye, bye.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.520
No, I have names for them.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.840
It's Instinct and 98.

58:14.840 --> 58:18.560
Me and Dave are back there trying to see if they can get Max 300 in the demo, which I

58:18.560 --> 58:20.240
told them they wouldn't be able to.

58:20.240 --> 58:21.240
And?

58:21.240 --> 58:22.240
No.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.240
I knew it.

58:23.240 --> 58:24.240
I knew it too.

58:24.240 --> 58:26.560
I thought they were walking.

58:26.560 --> 58:27.560
What can you do?

58:27.560 --> 58:30.680
Are you playing with a ferret?

58:30.680 --> 58:34.120
Oh, I'm supposed to talk about...

58:34.120 --> 58:35.120
Crap!

58:35.120 --> 58:36.120
Booty.

58:36.120 --> 58:37.120
What?

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
Booty?

58:38.120 --> 58:39.120
Booty.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.120
Gimme my demo, bitch.

58:40.120 --> 58:47.120
you

58:48.120 --> 58:49.480
and

58:49.480 --> 58:52.720
I was supposed to talk about what I got showed you guys during the very opening

58:52.720 --> 58:54.160
break in the show up

58:54.160 --> 58:57.320
SoCal kicks is helping us work on a new website

58:57.320 --> 59:00.320
and I showed it off to everybody in the room during the first break

59:00.320 --> 59:02.000
and it's pretty so far

59:02.000 --> 59:06.240
so we can't wait to see the finished product so hurry up

59:06.240 --> 59:08.400
I love getting other people to do work for me

59:08.400 --> 59:09.720
thank you

59:09.720 --> 59:14.000
I take back my fuck you, by the way.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.320
Give me a dollar.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.360
Let's see.

59:16.360 --> 59:19.120
I'm checking little private messages here to see what's going on.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.000
I sent somebody a letter in Animal Crossing that said, give me a dollar.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.520
And they said it was the best letter that I ever wrote.

59:24.520 --> 59:28.360
I also wrote another one that said, I like cheese.

59:28.360 --> 59:31.560
You cannot eat cheese because you are a robot.

59:31.560 --> 59:33.960
But you can cut it just fine.

59:33.960 --> 59:35.920
And they also said that it was a wonderful letter.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.080
It was moving.

59:37.080 --> 59:37.720
Yes, it was.

59:37.720 --> 59:39.040
It was like a bowel movement.

59:39.040 --> 59:40.560
i'm sorry

59:40.560 --> 59:44.000
dave i'm supposed to give you a special hello from right right she's listening

59:44.000 --> 59:47.680
right now

59:47.680 --> 59:52.480
yes i feel like she's still

59:52.480 --> 59:55.520
uh... let's see

59:55.520 --> 59:57.380
what else is there to talk about today any

59:57.380 --> 59:58.220
well let's do

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.460
assume update promote the let's hear all about

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.000
what's going on in the same world

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.420
uh... nothing

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.920
i know there's a lot going on

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.060
yet that's that's going on out

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.840
well start the obvious stuff that's that mean

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.700
no ferrets

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.900
are part of that

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:24.900
okay anyways uh... steady at three finalists finally been released

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.260
so everyone go enjoy that they have

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:32.660
of course uh... prepare support and he did answer support and coming up support

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:36.700
So it's just a bit more than just DDR, so go try that.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.860
And their editor kicks ass.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.940
They use it for everything.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.940
Aside from that, let's see here.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.140
DJ Bad's site is, of course, down at the moment.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.980
Actually, it's because Music Gaming Zone's site is down.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.940
Because he was using them as an affiliate, he's down as well.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:58.740
So not too bad for that, because I needed the files.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.700
But also, there's also my site.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.220
And if anyone has been reading any of the boards lately,

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.620
I've announced that I'm doing a project where

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.020
I'm making a DWI for every single BeatMania 2DX song

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.660
out there.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.260
So that started off pretty good so far.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:20.340
I've been averaging about one song a day.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.300
Right now I've got three of my originals up on my site.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.260
I've got Love Is Orange, The Sound of Goodbye,

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.020
and of course another one for Sakura.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.620
I have one of those.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.620
Plus, I'm hosting some files for other people.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.700
I've got a VJ Army by Moogle Hunter.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:39.020
And there's a couple other files up there.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.940
So go check it out.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.780
It's www.leechfromloki.tk.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.820
So go check that out.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.100
It's pretty awesome.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.100
Yeah, good shit.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.980
Other than that, really not too much going on.

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.420
There's about 4 billion files out there for Sacros.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.060
So if you don't like mine, go play someone else's.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:58.900
Pretty much it, man.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.900
Go play someone else's.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.900
You don't like my stuff? Too bad.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:07.900
Exactly. Other than that, you know, DDRPC, they released a nice Halloween-themed set of characters.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.900
They have one guy...

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.900
Hey, I like the one character that looks like Jack from...

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.900
They're cool, but just DDRPC is kind of...

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.900
All right. DDRPC sucks ass.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.900
The only reason I play DDRPC is because of the characters.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.900
The only one that anyone really pays attention to is the last one.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.900
Pantless Rage.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:30.220
But if they had pantless rage, I'm sure it would get everyone's attention.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.900
And three-titted Emmy, was it?

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.820
Three-titted Emmy and pantless rage.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.820
Yeah.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.420
From a long time ago.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.700
How long ago was that?

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.980
Episode number seven.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.940
Pretty sad I know that, huh?

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.140
Black Lab would like to hear from the ferret.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:53.580
It says we need to give the ferret some air time, so go for it.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.580
That was the ferret.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.220
And now Jamie and I have something else to get out of our system.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:06.220
We're looking at a picture of the guy I used to host under station live with, Travis, moved

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.220
to Texas.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.220
Jenna's in the picture.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.220
It's so cute!

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.220
I'm so happy.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220
Oh, it's so cute.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.220
It's so cute.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.220
Twen, no.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.220
No four-titted sky.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220
Jesus.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.220
What?

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.220
Oh, God, no.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.980
But the ferret likes the idea of your...

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:26.740
How do we get that squealing out of our system?

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.100
JB says, oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this,

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:29.740
but I'm going to.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.360
He's working on the graphics officially

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.740
for StepMania's PPP mode.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.240
Winner.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:34.980
Some local input.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.580
Winner.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.980
Para Para is cool.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:41.660
Then we can finally do a Para Para to stuff like my baby mama.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:44.220
Actually, that's one cool thing about the Para Para support

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.820
is it has the drivers built in for the actual controller.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.860
So if you have a Para Para controller out there.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.780
Which I do not.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.020
And a USB port, you just plug it in and it works.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.900
I have one.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.700
So it's awesome.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.140
Plug it in, in, in, in.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.140
So yeah, look for that.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.740
I bought it from George.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740
Go download it now.

01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.820
I know it sometimes.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.620
And oh yeah, DWI, well, they're still at version 2.03.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.860
They've been at 2.03 for like months now.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.460
I think DWI is dead.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:11.860
We don't know.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.660
They could come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden,

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.300
you know, it could be DWI extreme.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.140
They're playing catch-up right now.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:25.020
it's pretty bad ketchup they're playing ketchup no I'm not gonna play the

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:35.900
ketchup song do the dance near little mine Dave exactly speaking of DDR

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.060
extreme any other news new news that we're finding out about that I know

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.500
there were some pictures that came out and basically it just looks like max 3

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.660
so I have no idea why they'd bother to change the name for anyone who has a

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:50.340
live journal and is interested. There are people who are giving random updates now and

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:57.340
again on live journal community Beymani. Actually, I haven't seen many on the DVR live journal

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:03.600
community, but they have been doing updates on the Beymani community. There's been images

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.900
posted recently, so you might want to check it out.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.660
It's just Max 3, isn't it? What's so extreme about it?

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:19.660
They're coming out, they're bringing back a lot of old songs that I've noticed, as well as a bunch of really good ones.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:25.660
The whole thing is that they're just starting a new engine. That's just what it is. They're just changing names!

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.660
Max was a new engine!

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.660
Yeah, Max was a new engine. I mean, it was Max and Max 2, now Max 3.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660
So they're still tweaking it?

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.660
Max was a new engine. It had the full motion video, it had the freeze arrows, it was different enough to be a name.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.660
So what is it going to do?

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.660
Who is extremely not different?

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.660
Vibrate or something?

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.660
Going to give you happy Joy Joy feelings?

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.660
It's green.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.660
Dual Shock Dance Pad.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.660
It's going to give you happy Joy Joy feelings in the special places.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:54.660
The only real announcements that they made is a few of the songs that were only in the only modes are playable.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.660
Like Jet World, that was one of them.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.660
At least one hundred seconds.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.660
That's cool.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:09.020
What's so extreme? I still don't get it. From the pictures I've seen, there's nothing extreme

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.620
about it. Max 3.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:17.260
Whenever they come out with a game series and they release an extreme version, he says

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.820
that means that it's the nail in the coffin. And you know, from what I've been hearing,

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.900
DDR is a dying game.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:30.360
DDR is dying. But as I told Dan, lately it's been that if it's the last one, it's going

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.560
to be the final, so I don't think this is DDR the final yet. Nope, not yet. I don't

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.000
think it's the last one either. I don't think they've milked every single cent out of it

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.840
they can yet. And with Max coming out in the USA being pretty much, agreeably, the best

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:50.800
home release on any system yet, Matt's hand shot up in the air. Actually, I was just going

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:57.800
I want to mention something that you're mentioning, Max and stuff, and kind of DDR becoming more well-known and stuff.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:06.800
On Thursday, Halloween, okay, they're going to have, actually it's going to be on CBS This Morning.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.800
I think it's like the morning show, CBS Morning Show.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.800
They're going to have from 7 to 9 p.m., or a.m., I'm sorry.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800
Morning, hello.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:24.800
Yes, they're going to be doing exhibitions for DDR on the show live, and they're going to be covering it throughout the whole show, which will get a lot of publicity, at least out there.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.800
That's in New York, otherwise that would be fun to go to.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.800
That means there's only going to be like five people who play good.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.800
I don't know, there's a pretty good...

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.800
You're nice.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.960
No, actually there is a pretty good DDR community in New York, and I found this out after you know having to

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.640
Keep an eye on the New York

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.980
Thread for a while, but you know yes

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.880
I've actually seen a few of the people from New York play at least in videos and things and there's a pretty good crowd there

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:57.500
So I'd really look forward to seeing that wasn't somebody from here flying out there or is that happening or?

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:05.500
I thought it was DJ 8-Ball that's going out there. Aren't they going to have to letterbox as you go?

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500
No comment.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.500
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that my outside voice? I'm sorry. Anyway.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:19.500
That's not nice. We're a nice, friendly radio station, God damn it. Aren't we?

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:25.500
We're fucking wonderful people! We're nice, caring, wonderful, goddamn people!

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.500
And you love us! Worship us!

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.500
Ah, Black Lab says nobody Jen will be there.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500
Yes, she's a member of RTF.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.500
I haven't met her, but I've heard very good things about her.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500
Yes.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.500
Cool.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:45.500
Except there's parts of her... I'm not going to comment on that, because I commented on that during...

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.260
When we made a suggestions for what would be scored on in the shaft journey, okay?

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.900
I'm sorry, but and she's really good for freestyle

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.520
But how is it going to score you points with judges by grabbing your boobs, okay?

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.000
As part of a routine I'd like to make a comment on that

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:10.700
Give me that microphone that you are not a host to give me the microphone that heavily weighs on score

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.700
I believe, man.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.260
That is, grabbing one's boobs is not a show of talent.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:21.740
If I grab my boob in the middle of a freestyle routine, will you give me a hundred?

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.900
Now I said it didn't count for you.

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:29.740
It might count against you, but I said it scores heavily, depending.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.500
What if my boobs aren't very heavily?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:37.420
A person should be judged on how well they perform, not grabbing your boob.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.380
Hey, that's performance.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.380
Yeah, maybe in a strip club.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.380
But then like all the cheerleaders on the NFL teams and all the professional sports...

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.380
They're all sluts anyway.

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:51.380
But what if you grab your boobs on mirror mode? Then you're really fucked.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.380
You remember the whole mirror thing?

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:02.380
You know, I believe that was, a year ago today was SCAT. October 27th, right?

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.380
Yes, it was.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.380
Yes, a year ago today.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:11.380
We are having our show on the anniversary of the sacramental cosplay and tournament

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.420
where we had four people cosplay.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.700
But they were all very good.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.700
Yes.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.500
We had Ryan running around in his Afro Nova costume.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.540
And it was funny because Ryan didn't even try to enter.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.100
He just happened to dress up like the guy from Afro Nova.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.100
And then he's like, hey, wait, cosplay?

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.100
I'll enter.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.100
I like his routine too.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.100
And we had

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580
Who else was there Fiona

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.860
Dr. Hikaru

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.540
Because we're nice. We're not going to comment on

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.360
Yeah, great cosplay. Wonderful. Milia costume. Milia raised from Guilty Gear X

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.820
we had

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.820
Jossie in her

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.980
her petite carat her putico outfit and

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:59.020
And then we had, of course, Ryan Zafrenova costume, and then we had Satsuki as Devil

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.660
Zuki, who Travis interviewed for that.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:03.660
That was hilarious.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.660
That was hilarious.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.660
Oh, shit!

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.660
I need to get...

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.740
I'm going to get those interviews from him and play them on this show sometime.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.860
I hope you're listening, Travis.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.860
I really, really, really want those interviews.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.660
You know, please, I know you want to give them to me now.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.660
It's great.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.660
With sprinkles on top.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.980
Sprinkles on top.

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:18.980
I don't want sprinkles online.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.140
Those interviews were hilarious.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:25.620
I want them very bad. That's a bummer about him being in Texas, too, is now he can't do

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.060
our Shaft interviews. But that's okay, because we're going to have Orange Lounge, hopefully,

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:34.500
streaming all day long. Oops. Oops. Yeah. It was funny, because I remember he gave a

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.660
little sex quiz to all the people that he interviewed, except Dr. Hikaru, because he

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:46.660
was scared of what she might answer as, for some of the answers in the game. Yes, please.

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:52.660
No, we are not here. Like I said, we are nice, god damn it, and we are going to behave.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.660
We are fucking wonderful people.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.660
We're going to behave like degenerates.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.660
Next, please.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.660
So, anyway, I guess...

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.660
Travis wants to know what the hell I'm talking about.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.660
I think he just heard me say his name and he suddenly woke up.

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:08.660
Since we're on the tournament discussion subject, though...

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.660
Yes.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:20.220
Everyone, go to sackbamani.com, click on the link for SHAFT, go get some SHAFT, and there

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:25.940
is the information about Sackbamani hosts another fabulous tournament, or as we like

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:30.180
to say, Sackbamani hosts another fucking tournament, but you know, we're nice, so it's a fabulous

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:37.180
tournament, with lots of prizes thanks to Loki.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:03.660
Your prize is a scat, or I'm sorry, a shaft.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.340
Almost everybody's walking home with something.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.660
You know, we go to so many tournaments and people are always like, well the same people

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.660
always win.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.780
Well, if you show up, everybody's a winner.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780
Just about.

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.700
We'll also play as last.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.180
We are also assuming everything works out properly.

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.660
We are going to have a demo of DDR Max, the USA one.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.780
We are also, you know, we've been having these meetings.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.980
Basically the tournament is in two weeks.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.500
We're having, I've talked to a couple of people who are coming from out of state, which is

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.500
going to be good.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.220
We're going to have a big turnout for this.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:43.580
You know, Scandia has really been wonderful in helping us.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.380
We're having a bake sale.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:48.980
If you want to contribute to the bake sale, bring us your, you know.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:51.300
I'm making arrow cookies for the bake sale.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.660
We need fro cookies too.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.660
And afro cookies.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.660
We need the afro cookies.

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.620
and you know, we have Rice Krispie treats with, you know, little beat mania...

01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:59.740
We're gonna have beat mania bars.

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.300
Yeah, we'll have beat mania bars and, you know, if anybody wants to

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.300
wants to be in on the fun, you know, bring us your... We should like

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.540
get pineapple and cut them into arrows and then we can have some fruity paras.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.300
Oh. Ha ha ha ha.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.140
You know, just bring it, you know, bake something and bring it. We'll sell it.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:22.460
You know, basically this is gonna help, you know,

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.460
We're going to cover part of what we're doing for you guys.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:33.460
Also, we're coming up with a few more ideas for special prizes and drawings.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.460
Orange Lounge is going to be donating a prize.

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:40.460
It's going to be an orange pack with all your orange needs.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.460
Including the possibility of an orange lounge.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.460
Yes, we're looking into that, seeing if we can get that to happen, an orange lounge share.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.460
We're trying to make that happen.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:55.300
The tournament is going to be big, you know, for any of you who can't afford to fly out

01:14:55.300 --> 01:15:00.240
from whatever country or podunk county you live in, feel free to.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.240
We like company.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.500
You can take a plane, you can take a train, you can take a bus, you can take a boat, you

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.260
can walk, and if you're walking, leave now.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:18.420
And if you happen to be a paraplegic, you can squirm a quadruple amputee.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.420
You can roll.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.420
Yeah, come on down.

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.420
You can skateboard.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.420
I have no thanks.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:30.420
I don't know that anyone else has seen that movie.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.420
It's a really random one. Anyway.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.420
DJ Morpheus says,

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.420
Every tenth person there can get a free bottle of kaboom!

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.420
Winner!

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.420
Alright! Kaboom! The new orange!

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.420
Dude, I'm going to put that in the orange.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:46.420
Thank you for the idea.

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:51.420
We need to get little red bouncy balls and give them out as happy fun ball.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.420
It's fun! It's happy fun ball!

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.420
We're gonna give bouncy balls.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.420
We're going to give you balls.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.420
They didn't even come to the tournament, because I say so.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.420
Come or die.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.420
Skate or die!

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.420
That's dating you now.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:11.420
You know, I had my Charo reference.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.420
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.420
What are we gonna do? Are we gonna talk about something else?

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.420
Are we gonna do a list list? What do you want? List list for what?

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:26.420
We'll think of something. We'll think of something. Okay this might be a long break while we think of

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.420
what list list we're gonna do, but a surprise list list when we come back.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.420
I'm actually looking here on Orangelan's radio. I'm actually looking for a song

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.420
to play. Play something. Anything. Like Kachaka.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.420
Oh Kachaka. I don't have Kachaka dammit.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:47.420
We're all hopelessly addicted to kachaka, even those of us who haven't been able to pass it yet.

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.420
I'm looking for at least 100 seconds, I can't find it.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.420
Because it said we played it at this break.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.420
Shit.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.420
I know what we can play.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.420
Let's play the song.

01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.420
Let's play something that we played on Friday night's fucked up show.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:03.420
We're not playing dirty.

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.420
No, we're not playing dirty.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.420
And we'll play...

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.420
Kachaka.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.420
I don't have kachaka!

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:17.420
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo we'll play some other shit. Enjoy.

01:17:40.420 --> 01:18:04.420
I'm just walking down with my walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie.

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:48.420
You can feel my love in my walkie-talkie Walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie, baby

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.420
Don't let go, that's my walkie-talkie Walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:27.420
Every time you say you get in my mind

01:22:53.420 --> 01:23:22.400
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your Family wedding

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:47.360
When's the next time that we're going to take out the remote kit and tape some shit?

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.920
I guess shaft really.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.920
Hopefully, if it all goes well...

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.920
We're gonna be doing the whole day.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.920
Orange Lounge call broadcast is going to be broadcast straight from the Scandia Golf Course all day

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.920
For those of you guys that can't make it...

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.920
And we'll also rebroadcast it for those of you guys that are there

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.920
I wanna hear it later. We'll rebroadcast it at some point.

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.920
At least in bits and pieces.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.420
What do you mean the whole day?

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.920
We're going to be broadcasting the tournament all day.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.920
I thought you meant like just having a normal show next week all day.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920
That was weird.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:30.920
And since Jamie and I are going to kind of be busy with tournament stuff, I'm going to be out there doing a lot of the MC stuff and Jamie's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.920
We should have junior hosts.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.920
I'll only be able to get on the stream.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.920
We'll call them our cupcakes.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.920
Yes, our cupcakes.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.920
Tal will be MCing some of it and I'll be in the, oh he might be?

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.920
I don't know what's going on.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.580
what's going on whatever from what I'm told I'll be doing part of it or

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.680
something well depending on what's going on and I can get on the stream while

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:57.080
that's going on do some interviews and in the meantime we'll probably get Loki

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.680
on there some of your some familiar faces have been on the show in the past

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.560
maybe Brad and Irene will be doing some interviews okay here I face some

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.880
familiar voices that yes we'll be doing all the interview silhouette of my mind

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:15.040
Alright, list list, let's talk about list list, shall we?

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.680
Everybody knows what list list is, let's just go to it, no I'm kidding.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:24.640
This list list is basically best song that is in a DDR third mix or third Korean machine.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.640
But not second or first.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.220
So not second mix, we're leaving it to third mix.

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.720
Something that came from some sort of third mix.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.600
And we are basically leaving it at that so that in the future we can have second mix

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.780
as an option, and fourth mix as an option, et cetera.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.600
So let's start with the most special person in the room, me.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.480
If you want to contribute to List List,

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.720
basically we're going to name our top three best third mix stuff.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.640
And then we'll have a big list.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.240
And then each one of us gets to remove an unworthy song from the list.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.400
And then the chat room gets to decide on the final list.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.360
Yes?

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.280
And if anyone says Dynamite Rave, they get punched.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.280
Don't punch!

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280
Don't punch!

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280
Okay.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280
Yeah.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280
Okay.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.880
I'm waiting to give the rob back, the mic back to Rob.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880
We'll let, we'll let Rob start.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.880
I'm here.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.880
Wait, why do I have to start?

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.880
Because I said so.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.280
I guess because I never start, huh?

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.280
No.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.760
Oh, I'm also supposed to give a really quick announcement before I, because I'm cleaning

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.760
out my PM windows and interpretation list list.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.960
23rd Magus wants any locals in Sacramento or Bay Area, I guess, to go to Scandia and

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.960
bring your costumes.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.680
I don't know if there's going to be a contest or anything, but I'm just supposed to give

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.680
song that I did on double. It was a four actually, but I failed.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680
Oh okay.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.680
Actually I failed it the first time I ever played it.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:17.680
Yeah. This is tough. I've got like six choices. Okay, I'll go with the Boom Boom Dollar KOG

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.680
mix.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.680
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.680
Because that's cool. And the trick one is really cool.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.680
KOG. Whatever. Oh, okay.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.680
Oh, sorry. KOG. Oh, God.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.920
Big fucking deal. All right. Yes, Loki your number three choice

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.640
It's gotta be do it all night. Do it all night. Oh, yeah

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.360
I'm glad you put that on your list because I didn't

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:49.340
My number three save the save the best for last ladies. Last is space face

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.080
Awesome song face is pretty fucking cool

01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:00.080
My number two pick for best song on a third mix machine, If You Can Say Good-Bye.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.080
That's a good song.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.080
I love that song.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:08.080
Maybe the steps aren't the greatest, but the song is freaking amazing.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.080
The song is freaking rad.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.080
Your turn.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.080
And it's one that most people forget about, but it owns.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:20.080
Okay, my second choice is Song Suck, because I love the little thing in the middle.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:37.080
the middle. Next. No one can forget this. Afronova. Afronova. The song is fucking gay.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:46.200
The song is fucking gay. Caution. Just because I can sit and listen to that song on repeat

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.200
for a full hour and not even realize it.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.200
Should I put Caution or Gengo?

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.200
Most people know it as Caution.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.200
My number one choice...

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.200
Drum roll please.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.200
Drum roll please.

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.200
Please, I'm sure you all know this by now.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.200
My number one song is...

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.200
Oh Nick, Please, Not So Quick.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.200
That song owns.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.200
Yes, because Rob is our erotic whore.

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200
I fucking love that song.

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.200
Alright, that was the song that really got me hooked on DDR,

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.200
so give it its credit please.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200
Especially with karaoke mode.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.200
Okay, my number one choice is Beautiful 21C.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.200
Is that song on?

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.200
Gotta go to who?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.200
Yes.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.200
Gotta go to hot do.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.200
Yes, beautiful.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.200
See, he stole one of mine, so I'm gonna let him have it, though.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.200
I couldn't pick something else.

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200
No, you can't.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.200
Loki, your number one pick.

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.200
No, this is probably gonna get a lot of flack for this, but this is the song that I've learned

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.200
on one of the songs other than Pink Dinosaurs.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.200
It's not that song, okay?

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.200
It's La Senorita.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:51.200

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.860

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.480

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.520
but uh... the song song sucks anyway

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.080

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.240

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:28.840
vote off

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:31.960
surprisingly enough i'm not going to go with the one that you think i'd vote off

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.360
i'm actually going to take out boom boom dollar

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.520
the k o g mix because

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.080
i'm sorry the remix

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.060
the steps

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.000
suck

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
the original

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:42.740
owns

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.180
but the remix sucks

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.520
i remember having an asthma attack on that song

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.960
so fuck k o g

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.800

okay dave

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.240
i will take off

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.200
if you can say goodbye

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.040
asshole

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.540
uh... inhale

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.200
by travis

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.760
i'm not a huge fan of these uh... korean songs

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.560
which is why i don't miss them

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.460
uh... so i'm gonna have to say goodbye to uh... some stuff yes

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:25.020
loki is my friend

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:28.900
the ability with horrible choices left to make

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.300
you have to eliminate one of these songs i fucking love playing all of these

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:36.140
songs

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:39.700
there are two that i'm putting back and forth in

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.240
unfortunately the best ones that

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.980
look at it

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:45.600
and then take off after never

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.700
old taken off after does not stop at that time since for

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.240
personal you know

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.720
it she's not total personal vengeance

01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:04.200
So our list is, as soon as we have it posted to the chatroom, we have Flashdance, Do It

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:11.040
All Night, Bass, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Senorita, and

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.520
Gentle Stress AMD's Sexual Mix.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.880
Sounds good.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.200
And while you guys vote, we're going to take a minute and we're going to play one of those

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.680
songs that totally got neglected from our list.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.280
So why you guys vote from it, and it's all day's fault, too, by the way.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.380
And we're going to play the full version of it, and you can send in your votes, and you

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:33.100
got three minutes to do it, and then we're going to read the list when we come back here

01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:34.100
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.840
Make sure to send your votes in private message.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:40.120
Votes must be over private message to Sky in the chat room, or they don't count.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:47.120
sick of the ferret on you.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.120
Oh, yeah, you will be the one who made us all know

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.120
Look out for your kind, oh, yeah

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.120
You are the one who made us all know

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.120
You are the one who made us all know

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.120
Oh

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.120
Baby, tell me why

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.120
You say that love is not a possession

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:14.120
You say that love needs fantasy

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.120
You say we must hear this devotion

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.120
But you don't say that you love me

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.120
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.620
Sometimes I'm cold and serious

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:32.620
But when you touch my body and close your eyes

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:36.120
My little baby, I don't realize

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.620
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.620
You don't wanna love me just like I do

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:50.620
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:55.100
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:58.100
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:03.100
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.780
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:05.180
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we've just been doing a little list-list segment

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:10.700
on the, what are we calling this, the best third mix or third Korean ever, right?

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:14.620
Yeah, this is list-list third mix Korean plus.

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.620
Okay, yes.

01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:22.100
So, without further ado, let's read the, let me read you what the list was that we had

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.100
to pick from here.

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:29.260
Flash Dance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C,

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.060
La Senorita, and Gentle Stress AMD.

01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:34.700
And now, I reveal the results to you.

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.700
Drum roll please.

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:38.940
Jamie, will you please tell them what the number three song was?

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.420
Fresh Dance.

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.420
Fresh Dance, yay!

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.760
Yay, a very good song.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.100
And the second place winner, Jamie.

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.100
Gentle Stress.

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100
Yay!

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.100
Because I had good taste.

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:51.380
Gentle Stress.

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:56.380
And the number one song, by an overwhelming margin, might I add, was...

01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.380
Jamie.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.380
Do It All Night.

01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.380
Yay!

01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:07.180
Do It All Night wins the bestest third Korean song ever.

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:11.140
I want to say, I don't have bad taste, it's just everyone in the chat room who didn't

01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:15.180
vote for a beautiful 21C, because that song pwns so cool.

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.740
And a beautiful 21C, by the way, got no votes.

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:19.740
You know what we should do?

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:20.740
What?

01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:26.740
We'll do it after birth or after the show.

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740
That's another thing I should add, by the way.

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:32.740
In effect, to keep you people listening to the station, we're not going to drop listeners

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:33.740
after the show anymore.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.740
We'll go right into music when the show is done.

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:40.740
So you can stay tuned and hear random shit from Bemani and maybe more.

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:41.740
Yay!

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:42.740
It's bootylicious.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.740
They just don't shut up about that baseball game in the chat room.

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:53.780
I guess the Angels one it sounds like right. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm falling asleep on the watch here my bad

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.200
my bad

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.200
No, my baby mama

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:04.540
The chat rooms begging me to play the legend

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.740
screw them

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.540
After after bro, okay. We'll do the legend in the afterbirth

01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:15.000
Never playing that fucking other song again. No, we're not gonna play dirty. What?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
When you're MC'ing at Shaft, we need to still do the rave thing.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
That'd be hilarious.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Except we're gonna get the biggest, like, you faggots look from the crowd.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
But that's okay.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You got a problem with that?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You can bite my big toe.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
That's right.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Jamie was teasing the idea earlier that we ought to take this show to three hours.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
What do you guys think?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Chat room, let us know, what do you think, three hours or what?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Or send us your comments over email, OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.760
I said that if we do three hours, then the last hour is going to be all after birth.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:49.520
It's just going to get really random.

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.240
We might start expanding into other types of video game things, like video game reviews.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.960
Well since Under Sedation Alive is, you know, off air in Sacramento, we can kind of roll

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.600
over to something more like that show for the last hour.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600
That could be quite possible.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600
We could also...

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600
Possibility.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.600
I don't want to steal, but...

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.060
We just have to do one big nerd fest.

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060
One big nerd fest.

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.060
I like that.

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:15.860
We do anime reviews, or we can have the random reviews, like my review of Contra Shattered Soldier.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:21.060
Yeah, but I know that I probably wouldn't be able to stay until 10, because I need to have a ride right now.

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.060
I don't have a license.

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:26.060
That'd be the overage part of the show. The legal part.

01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.060
That's when we all get drunk and smoke crack.

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.760
And then in four months, I'll be right here, and I'll stay the whole time.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.460
Yeah, you gotta bring your own pipe.

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.060
Your own crack pipe.

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:37.860
Yeah, because we smoke crack when you leave.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:46.180
That was something else I was thinking about bringing to Shaft was getting some sugar crystals

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:50.820
and selling crack at the bake sale, but it would just be sugar crystals, but I say crack

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:51.820
rocks.

01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:52.820
That'd be funny.

01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.100
Orange Lounge crack.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.820
And yes, we're working on the phone call thing, so please stop begging.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.940
It's sad.

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:01.940
We're working on the phone calls.

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.940
We're going to be able to take those soon.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.740
And then we've got the new website coming.

01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:08.260
We're going to have a whole new season of Orange Lounge Radio before you know it.

01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:09.260
It'll be like Buffy.

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.260
We'll go on forever.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.260
Yeah, it'll be like Buffy.

01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:12.740
We'll kill off Jamie.

01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:13.740
No!

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:18.700
And then bring her back to life and introduce her sister she never knew about.

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:24.460
Yeah, made from my genetic material and soul or something, and she's the next slayer.

01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:26.860
And then James Marsh is a nice vampire.

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:30.200
Dude, Spike's hot.

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.820
So what exactly would that be like?

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:40.420
darker shade of hue Sakura or gray Sakura you know I'll be like like you know

01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:48.060
blacklight Sakura Oh glow you'll be rave Sakura I need a hug let me give you my

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:53.220
son or better yet you'll be booty Sakura so let me give you my Sengoku

01:46:53.220 --> 01:47:00.220
We got ten minutes left for the show.

01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.220
Time for you to get a watch.

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.220
Time for you to shut up.

01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.220
Yeah, get a watch, slacker.

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.220
Let's see, did I have anything else on the schedule for tonight?

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.220
Nope.

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:16.220
No, we're going to sit and talk about shit.

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:19.220
Did you guys hear the fake Legend of Max MP3?

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.220
No.

01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.220
You want to hear the fake one?

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:24.220
We're going to play the fake Legend of Max.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.220
to congratulate Cory on his fun hoax.

01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:32.220
Sounds like a big techno industrial- I feel like raving, gimme a hug!

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:33.220
Sounds happy hardcore.

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:43.220
When I get an envelope full of light powder, my first impression is to snort it!

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.220
Well even if it isn't- GONG!

01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:47.220
Hey, well even if- That's so Asian!

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.220
GONG!

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:55.220
gong

01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:59.200
mmm

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.480
smells like dog

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.340
action

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:09.900
this is the most repetitive fucking song i've ever heard

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:16.740
there's your free zero the big gone gone

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.820
now i have your

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.740
it over to the fat lady sings this

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:26.340
there's the opera singer

01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.260
you know

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:33.260
that we have a lot

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.620
just call it

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:41.900
if you go from the development

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.820
sakura sounds more like max and the status or help

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.160
i think that it

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.020
I'd rather have it sound like that. You know, to be honest I'm kind of sick of Max and Max

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:58.620
Unlimited and all the regurgitations of Max. That would have been a nice change for sure.

01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:59.620
I agree.

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:05.840
Speaking of MP3s that are probably fake, Pyro sent this to me before the show. We all know

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.360
what that means. It's supposedly graduation by B4U, but lord knows what we're actually

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:16.120
going to get when I double click on this file, because Pyro Man is our resident prankster

01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.520
in the chat room, so this could be a bunch of four-letter dirty words, it could be the

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.720
Spice Network for all I know, but...

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.480
It's gonna be like a four-minute fart.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.320
Which would be not too far from what an actual B4U song would sound like.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320
True.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.640
I made a pun.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.560
Alright, let's see what it is.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.200
This is supposedly Graduation by B4U.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:49.200
Oh, the back singing indicates it's B.P.U.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:56.200
Maybe this really is it.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:08.200
You know what it is? I think it's dive backwards.

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.200
Well, it's actually Japanese.

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.200
Jamie's trying to see if she can hear the lyrics.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.200
I swear to God, this is probably just true or die played backwards.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.200
It's not.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.200
This is legit.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.200
Really? What are they saying?

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:51.200
I only know or understood like five words out of this.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:57.200
Unfortunately the vocals are a little bit too low for me to hear over the music with the stuff that my head is.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:18.200
Well who knows, either we just gave you a world exclusive or you never heard that here.

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.200
It was a messy song.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:25.200
The nasal singing of Be For You.

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.200
JB brings up a good point. There's no announcer.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.200
It has the cheering, but there's no announcer.

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:34.200
If it's from a test, it may not have the announcer in.

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:39.200
I believe I read on Air in Japan that it has the same announcer as Max.

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.200
Now, what if it was from a single or something like that?

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.200
You ever know?

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.200
Possibly be.

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.200
Alright, so maybe that was graduation, maybe it wasn't.

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:52.200
You just don't know anymore because there's too many damn people out there spreading fake fakers.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:59.200
the

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:05.000
uh... you missed the voting but by about like ten minutes it was that

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.240
twenty-third bag is sorry

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.000
but even before he voted for los enorito

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.200
it's

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.880
that would have that would have made or break any ties so no worries

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.600
i can't believe that survived the list anyway should've knocked out without

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:19.900
skin

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:23.900
it's good i was going to vote it off because it sounds like a mind thing is

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.300
let me read that

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:26.860
in uh... trick

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:27.620
is fun

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:31.380
it is because of the little skidded into that jump in you

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.180
and even up

01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.220
what's your favorite newbie move

01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.740
everything

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.460
i think there's less energy to skip to my favorite movie with either that or

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.220
the clapping in the clock

01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.540
i would probably

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.140
say that my favorite

01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.700
is actually

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:49.700
in this image that i was doing two years ago by very ever first routine with the

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.700
butterfly spin the butterfly bounce jump alright you know what I'm talking about

01:53:54.700 --> 01:54:00.180
where you have your two jumps you stomp on on you alright for people who

01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:05.020
remember the steps for butterfly basic you've got right foot step jump and then

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:08.460
you turn around and jump the other way but you bounce before you do it and I

01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:12.780
think it kind of looks neat and my other favorite one is the spins on love to me

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:17.300
where they're like down up jump and then down up jump again and you do the spins

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:24.820
I'm not sure if this is considered a newbie freestyle move or not, but I love the caution

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:25.820
drop.

01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.820
It's so fun.

01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:27.820
I love the caution drop, too.

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820
I'm really tall, so it's really hard.

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820
But it's fun.

01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:35.260
I don't know if that's considered a newbie move or just an A-team freestyle type move

01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:36.260
or what.

01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:38.980
You have to be damn precise to make it look good, though.

01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:39.980
Yeah.

01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:42.500
Only little B can pull it off well.

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:43.500
Yeah.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.860
The caution drop is cool.

01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:46.860
Great radio.

01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:48.860
I'm doing the caution drop for all of us.

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:50.860
No, he's like, what's the caution drop?

01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:52.860
I'm like, here, let me show you.

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.860
Do you have any favorite doofus?

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.860
I used to do the knee drop on End of the Century.

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.860
I thought I was all cool.

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.860
I still do knee drops now.

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:12.860
For my one edit for Ecstasy where it freezes on a knee drop in the center two arrows on doubles.

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.860
I stopped doing that because it bruises my knees very badly.

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:19.860
Did I still have, okay, this is where I compare scars.

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:22.860
Abbruise, right there.

01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:26.860
For all those who can't see through the radio, she's pointing to her knee.

01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:28.860
Wait, I have, um...

01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.860
Dude, you have a scar.

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.860
I do?

01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:32.860
Yeah, you have a little bit of a scar.

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:37.860
Yeah, that's from playing bakwa, my routine, where I scraped my knee because I fell.

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:49.140
I just remember being at Fana Mae last year, in my Emmy costume, doing my favorite Kamikaze

01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:54.120
drop on Love to Me, back when Love to Me was still kind of cool, going out into the hall

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.020
with blood dripping down my leg from landing on a screw on that fourth class.

01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:04.860
For Shaft, I could do a rehash of my Dynamite Rave routine where I forget my steps about

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.860
That started off so cool.

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.860
15 seconds into the song.

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:13.860
He pulls off the trench coat and everyone's like, oooh, and then he forgets his desk.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.860
He's like, oooh, crap.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.860
It was so awesome, the beginning of it.

01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:21.860
It was like the matrix.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:25.860
And actually, one of the coolest knee drops I've ever seen was also at the same font of

01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:26.860
me.

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:33.060
A guy I know, Chris, did Dynamite Rave just as one of the characters from Guilty Gear

01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:40.060
X and did the corner knee drop where you step on the up and right and then knee drop down

01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:44.420
to the bottom and left diagonally. That looks really cool.

01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:47.540
You know I actually have a scar on my leg in the exact same place that Dave has one

01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:50.980
but it has nothing to do with DDR. It's from a game of Truth or Dare.

01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:55.820
Wow! Stand by to win! Wow!

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:59.420
What's going on out there in the hall? Oh, I see. Oh, my roommate's on the phone. Too

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:01.420
We can't broadcast over the air hi

01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:05.460
This is really good radio. It's great radio

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:10.240
You know I actually like you know as much as people didn't complain about it

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:17.460
I miss the old you know 18 style moves. Just because if you do them, right?

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:23.380
Hilarity so amazing coordinated though and true their tired routines

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.520
You know I like watching people do like real dance moves on DDR, and that's great

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.520
And I would prefer watching that for different freestyle since I've judged a few tournaments before.

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:39.520
But the 18 stuff, when done right, is so clean. And it looks really good.

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:45.520
I miss the Chang'O's do-it-all-night routine. I love that.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.520
I don't miss him at all.

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:54.520
I remember, was it his Ninzabur routine where he was like, what's that guy who brings out the Hammerin' Squad?

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.720
days like the gallagher okay that means that

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:03.080
yeah we squashed the watermelon in the that's too big

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.260
okay

01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.360
it's like it's fine

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.320
it's like to look i'm a hard to get me attention

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.960
anyway

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.420
okay

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:14.700
jimmy ray

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.040
we're going to smash a watermelon

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:20.760
was funny

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.760
It was stupid.

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.760
On the point, it was random.

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:26.760
It was still stupid.

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.760
That's not funny, that's not something that wins a tournament.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.760
It's like two heads arguing back and forth.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.760
Random, stupid, random, stupid.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.760
Random is good, but only when it's funny random.

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.760
I'm sure he didn't enter trying to win with that routine.

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760
It was still retarded.

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.760
Speaking of random and stupid, this show is about over.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.760
Well actually, he won third.

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.760
Dude, no.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:53.760
It just goes to show what lovely judges you can get at a tournament sometimes, right?

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:55.760
It just goes to show people are easily amused.

01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.760
Anyways, we should talk about the movie Jackass.

01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.760
That movie rocks.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.760
No.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.760
Come up later.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.760
Jamie's not going to go see that.

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.760
All right. Final thoughts, Jamie.

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:04.760
Well, let's start with the cupcakes.

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:07.760
Loki, any final thoughts here?

01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:12.760
Go check out my website if you haven't, www.leechfromloki.tk.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.760
Leave me a request for what 2DX song you want me to make into DWI next,

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:25.120
next and I'll put it up there that's it I have nothing more to talk about I guess

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:28.060
I'll talk about a movie that I want to talk about in the afterbirth not

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:37.760
jackass but until then yeah okay they're talking about stuff and here's my final

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:43.400
thought

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.200
impressive

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.520
god my nose hurts

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:50.840
and my uh... final thought is i need a date

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.480
date rob

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:54.240

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:57.560
