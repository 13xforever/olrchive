124255	130938	Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 15 for October the 6th of 2002.
132438	136982	You're tuned into the Bimani Sing's most super-duper radio station of all things Bimani.
137382	139284	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
139784	141666	Joining me as always is our resident Happy Bunny.
141746	144729	Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
145129	146050	Hi.
147411	148492	You sound so weak tonight.
148532	149313	You sound weakened.
149573	150674	Hi!
151214	152916	DarkSakura needs food badly.
153336	154357	I had cupcakes.
154377	155458	That's my crack.
155738	156799	Now I have vanilla crack.
157099	157820	I've had nothing.
157840	158681	Did you have a ho-ho?
160347	161788	I don't need no ho, thank you.
161808	163089	What are you calling a ho-ho?
163109	169172	I can lay for free.
169632	171053	I can already tell it's going to be one of those nights.
172073	173834	Small, intimate little gathering tonight.
173914	176256	We've got our loyals here.
176276	178617	We've got Loki, who I don't think has missed a show yet.
179147	179887	No, I have not.
179907	180747	You're so cool.
181788	184949	And Loki, by the way, knows how to kiss some host ass.
185069	186569	We'll get into that later in the show.
186949	190770	How Loki won some major brownie points with Jamie and I tonight.
190990	195191	And of course, there's the always running into the last second he possibly can.
195271	196992	Dave, how you doing?
197072	197552	It's not my fault.
197572	203674	I wanted to go earlier, but my dad's like, hell no, I'm watching football game.
203834	204834	Damn, that's a soft drone.
204854	205194	Damn it.
205734	206594	Hey, that's a soft drone.
206614	207195	That's cool.
210718	217400	Okay, so we'll be talking to everybody else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do some more of Jamie's picks.
217760	220040	That whole last hour was just nothing but Jamie picks.
220140	220740	It's special.
221140	222081	We're doing more Jamie picks.
222281	223061	How is it special, Jamie?
223081	225902	This particular one is one that I talked about last week.
226042	231863	It's basically Osamu Kubota and Tack live doing Presto and Era.
233483	238305	And the one after that is a song that's from Beatmania Final.
239125	239985	It's the Naoki track.
240678	241258	Sounds very good.
241278	242319	We're going to hear those.
242419	246001	And later on, we're going to be talking lots and lots and lots about Max USA.
246061	247821	Tons of news on that coming up.
248362	250022	And we'll talk about 8th Style.
250063	254064	We'll see if we can get Naoki Journals, your FUs of the week, and just a ton of shit tonight.
254104	255865	So tell everybody to listen.
256085	258527	Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
258947	259807	Dear Diary.

549166	549883	Thanks for watching!
601949	608531	Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, Ash!
609051	611732	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
615074	616894	Yes, that was very random.
617434	617794	Thank you.
618955	619595	Ash, Ash.
620195	621456	We have Jazz in the chat room tonight.
621556	622036	Hello.
623937	624657	Hello.
624857	625637	Hello to everybody.
625797	627838	We are very glad to have you back in the chat room.
628427	630008	Hello to everybody in our chat room.
630048	632150	We've got lots of people in there tonight.
632170	644159	And if you want to join our chat room, you've just got to go to any OtherSideIRC server like irc.eggheads.org or carma.othersideirc.net and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
644460	646161	And we expect you a nice play again.
646681	646882	Yes.
649123	651165	So, wow.
651425	652246	Wow, big...
653414	654034	How was your week?
654634	656715	Let's transition our way into the show here.
656795	659736	Dad's going to go into my fuck you of the week, so we should hold on to that.
659776	662817	I'm going to tease our show, because we usually do fuck you's of the week, like, first thing right away.
662837	663297	I'm going to tease them.
663317	666538	I'm going to do it maybe the second half of the show, just because I feel like it.
667098	668698	I don't feel like doing the fuck you's right now.
668738	669759	Yes, we're evil.
670179	671339	We're going to make you wait.
673000	674460	I have some thank you's of the week, though.
674920	677141	I've got plenty of happy news for this week.
677161	677661	You don't need happy.
678197	678818	We need pissy.
679678	680459	I want to be happy.
681019	687265	I've got lots of happy news to... Well, as we mentioned before we went to break, Loki knows how to kiss some host ass around the show.
687985	691809	Got Jamie and I some advanced copies of Notorious CHO on tape.
692109	692990	How cool is that?
694253	694913	Thank you!
715878	716498	And what else?
716518	716979	Walgreens.
744288	746809	Last Minute Junk Food around about 15 minutes before I came here.
747090	747850	And Vanilla Crack.
749151	750312	And yes, Vanilla Coke.
750472	751533	And there was something else I wanted to thank.
751573	752454	I forget what it was, though.
754395	757438	I would like to thank Air for being there for me to breathe.
758458	761881	Rob wanted to thank me for being beautiful and inspirational.
761961	764323	I'm like a muse.
764503	768026	Here he comes, Mr. Orange Lounge.
771494	774476	By the way, that's the only time you're going to hear me sing on this show.
776557	778619	Unless you do your Let Them Move Elmo mix.
779999	780560	Oh, God.
780580	781180	That's old school.
781220	782301	That is old school.
782581	783942	I haven't done the Let Them Move Elmo mix.
784182	790806	The only reason I don't do the Let Them Move Elmo mix on this show, because I know Twen would get a hold of it and make some nasty remix out of it.
790906	794027	So, I'm just withholding the Elmo bit.
794488	794608	So...
796949	799671	Back in the news about DDR, Bimani.
799771	800472	How was your week?
800532	802093	How was your week in the Bimani world?
802493	803974	I heard you had some accomplishments this week.
805075	811019	Okay, well, I tried to stop counting how many 9-footers I was doing, but I'm still kind of excited about it because I did so many in a row.
811639	813901	And I finally owned Twilight Zone.
814508	819512	And then me being the big idiot that I am, decided to do So Deep, and my legs gave out from under me.
819532	821153	Yeah, pretty far though, I was watching you do that.
821333	826057	We were all, like, I don't know if you know, but Irene, myself, and Brad, we were all kind of huddled in the corner watching you do it.
826077	828439	We were like, oh, oh, oh, oh!
828479	836244	My legs actually, you know when you get so tired that your legs just get really stiff after playing DDR?
836745	839347	That happened to me and I could not move, I actually had to grab the bar.
840427	844669	and, you know, the bar for me, I usually treat it like it's, you know, made out of feces or something.
845770	849852	Oh, accomplishments, I passed two seven stars on 2DX, yay.
850032	853034	Absolute and Buffalo, and they were cool.
853054	853814	Buffalo!
854194	855895	Yeah, that song was cool.
857176	859577	But I tried many more, but I failed them all.
860217	861138	I'm not good enough yet.
862011	863532	Not until I can pass all of them.
863592	865253	Be for you, another.
866354	868756	Try Y31.
868936	869677	Y31 is easy, try it.
870197	871638	But I can't have it yet.
871738	872939	I was very, very happy today.
872979	876122	I passed a 7-star in 2DX and I wanted to pass it for a long, long time at sync.
876902	879664	And I did Summer Vacation a couple days ago, too, which is Flashing 7.
879925	880445	That made me happy.
880465	881926	Apparently my controller is blessed.
881986	884288	Your controller is the bomb diggity.
885014	888956	My 2DX controller kicks everybody else's controller's ass.
889236	891797	And, you know, I'm still pissed off about my arcade controller.
892137	892497	Why is that?
892937	896219	Because KonamiStyle hasn't emailed me back to let me know it's being re-delivered.
897099	897780	Fuck Konami!
897840	898460	Oh, wait, we're not there yet.
898880	900581	Wait, why does your controller kick ass?
901321	903662	Because my controller has magical powers.
903762	906423	I can only pass Summer Vacation on her controller.
906784	907984	I can't do it on my own controller.
908904	911946	I can only do it on hers, because hers goes clacky-clacky-clack, and mine just goes...
914605	920868	My controller stuck for like a week and then I bitched at it and it unstuck and has been beautiful ever since.
921168	933534	Oh, because I was playing on Scott, White Freestyle or whatever, his 2DX controller and he said that he like shaved it down or something and it worked perfectly.
933634	934135	It was pretty cool.
934175	936036	I'm not raping my controller yet.
936056	938717	Yeah, I don't know, but it worked and it didn't stick at all, so.
939065	952089	I'm scared to open up my controller and give it an operation, because I don't know, if you ever played that game Operation, I was so horrible at it, and I'm afraid I'd do the same thing to my 2DX controller, that the big red light would go off and go... Let me fix your controller.
953009	955170	Oh, you're going to fix my controller?
955230	957871	I will use the power of my bitchiness on your controller.
958491	961452	I will put the fear of me into your controller.
961472	966293	Are you just going to lay it on the ground and just go... I command thee to work!
966934	967794	Be healed!
969451	971512	The power of Christ compels thee.
971592	973772	The power of Christ compels thee.
976093	978314	Demon be gone from this controller.
979154	981135	I hope my roommate didn't decide to go to bed early tonight.
981235	982075	Oh, okay, good.
982775	983115	Good thing.
983435	984636	If he's smart, he got out of the house.
984716	985036	I don't know.
985916	986516	I didn't see him.
989017	994179	Oh, I'm getting a suggestion in the chatroom that when I play Operation, I should take out the battery and I'll win every time.
994579	995159	Oh, winner.
996039	996800	You know what I do?
996840	996940	What?
999255	1001477	I pick up the thing and dump it upside down.
1001497	1004940	I wonder if you could do that with patience.
1005481	1006922	You should be a doctor, Jamie.
1007202	1008303	You'd make tons of money.
1008343	1010385	Hey!
1012667	1013568	We need to say hi.
1013708	1016591	A big special hello to our buddy, Sharks Girl.
1016851	1019474	Hi, wifey poo.
1019634	1020494	Just for you, baby.
1021535	1022036	Hi, Rose.
1023550	1026832	Dear Diary, I've got a donut with your name on it.
1028652	1030153	It made me feel all tingly.
1030993	1032194	I don't want to talk Bomani tonight.
1032234	1033434	Let's just sit here and ramble.
1034374	1038356	Dear Diary, I decided that I was going to be a hockey fan.
1039376	1040157	Yay!
1041397	1045439	You know, I swear to God, Naoki and Michael Jackson have got close relatives.
1045659	1048100	I mean, they're both hideously feminine.
1050027	1053809	Do you remember the rumor that Naoki was supposed to be one of the hidden members of B4U?
1056731	1058271	I'm still convinced that he's a woman.
1060212	1060532	Thank you.
1060833	1062834	That burp was brought to you by a vanilla Coke.
1063734	1067056	It's got that chili flavoring to it that I had earlier today.
1067516	1068797	And now it's all over the mic.
1070117	1071138	Ew, it's Rob's mic.
1071258	1072538	And I want to thank Del Taco.
1073179	1074179	Del Taco owns.
1074379	1075080	That's all I want to say.
1075100	1075340	Thank you.
1076498	1078019	All you people who ate real food today.
1078819	1083602	I've had a donut, string cheese, and cupcakes.
1084162	1084743	Whee!
1085083	1088024	Oh, oh, oh, oh, and the all-important bottle of Propel.
1092427	1098130	I'm on the supermodel diet right now, where I have a cigarette for breakfast and two shots of tequila for dinner.
1099290	1100891	What were you saying, Dave?
1104093	1108095	For the sake of internet radio, I say that we get back to anything relevant.
1108135	1108936	Yeah, fuck him.
1108976	1109896	No, fuck Bomani.
1110156	1110977	Stop playing DDR.
1110997	1111677	That's our advice.
1111757	1112578	Get your life back.
1113874	1115474	Save your podiatrist the trouble.
1115794	1116915	Don't turn out like us.
1117795	1118495	We're nerds.
1118895	1119515	Help us.
1119695	1125417	So anyways, yesterday, went to an awesome party for Pat.
1126297	1128737	Hey, Pat's cool.
1129397	1130198	I missed going.
1130238	1130938	I wanted to go.
1131198	1131718	His birthday.
1132098	1135379	So we went and we played the DDR sim, of course.
1135579	1137299	The giant DDR sim.
1137919	1139460	It's all about Super Shuffle.
1139480	1140540	Super Shuffle.
1141019	1144143	Now, if you've ever wondered what is... What, pray tell, is Super Shuffle?
1144404	1146526	Super Shuffle is what Shuffle should be.
1146847	1148889	It's where every single step is random.
1149330	1152855	And then what's fun is Shuffle works in doubles.
1153255	1156019	So playing Super Shuffle in doubles is like playing Twister.
1156299	1158942	No, and see how Freeze Arrows work is...
1159543	1161865	Freeze arrows are set when the next arrow comes up.
1162505	1169329	So normally in a song, they have the specific ending, and then the next note comes up under it.
1169650	1172992	But since there's no note coming up under it, the freeze arrow just keeps going.
1173312	1176054	You might have to hold, in doubles, eight freeze arrows.
1176454	1177675	It happened last night.
1178275	1180576	Scott had to hold all eight arrows.
1180676	1183218	He failed that song, but it was funny.
1184259	1186100	That's when you have an orgy on the dance pad.
1186638	1190420	You know what, Loki, I'm not playing on your metal pads again until you get the Spider Stomp sim.
1191420	1191840	Rock on!
1191860	1193081	Spider Stomp!
1193501	1194982	Fuck Blamati, it's all about Spider Stomp.
1195962	1200184	Well, hi-ho on doubles is actually pretty much like Spider Stomp, it's just all jumping.
1201175	1208480	Could you imagine how fucking horrible Golfland would be if, well, you know, even more so Golfland horrible?
1208580	1209300	No!
1209420	1228253	Even more so if fucking DDR spat out tickets Dude, I would be walking out of there with scooters every day I know, but think about just how horrible the lines would be If DDR spat out tickets, it's over, I quit
1230246	1233269	Do you know how much free, useless shit that we have?
1233729	1244958	Like, I'd have a million little blinking Raver lights, and like five skateboards, and oh my god, I'd spend so much money on that game, even if I only got one ticket for every time I played, I'd still have a ton of shit.
1245799	1248981	It's about time they give me something back for the money I spent on that damn thing.
1250543	1251584	You know, you get it.
1252825	1253565	I'm sorry, Dave.
1253845	1255247	Did somebody say Raver?
1255547	1256608	Did somebody say Raver?
1260686	1261906	It's like being in a rave!
1261926	1264747	Did somebody say rave-er?
1266428	1267048	Aw yeah!
1268348	1269609	I love you guys!
1270189	1270789	I love you!
1270809	1272389	Aw, I love you Jamie!
1272669	1274330	Aw, give me a uh, man!
1275070	1277111	Aw, this is some good shit!
1278743	1281524	Okay, let's get this train back on the rails here.
1284065	1288367	Should we talk about... This is what we get for having all that sugar before the show.
1288407	1293389	Yeah, but I didn't, see, so... Should we talk about the weekly... You ate Cheetos, those are weak sauce.
1294409	1294929	So what?
1295030	1296450	They're orange, it's themed.
1296630	1297911	Okay, okay.
1297931	1302052	From now on, whenever anyone starts talking about raves on this show, I'm going to play Sandstorm.
1302392	1304413	Coming to a max, USA near you.
1304673	1305074	We think.
1305274	1305854	We're pretty sure.
1305894	1306174	We hope.
1307156	1308477	It's confirmed, damn it.
1309257	1310418	So, none of that.
1311599	1314161	Anyway, your little precious update.
1314721	1315622	Yes, our update.
1316602	1321005	Naoki spouted off his little crap today, but we didn't really care about what he had to say.
1321425	1328170	All we cared about is the new information about DDR Max 3, which is that non-stop modes will be making a return.
1330040	1333123	So, hooray for non-stops, I guess.
1334203	1335344	So, I guess that'll be fun.
1336705	1347114	Also, going to be, actually, not really news yet, but it's coming, is next week they're going to announce what song won the vote for, that's actually going to be in Max 3.
1348087	1348667	One song?
1348987	1350148	One song is going to win the vote?
1350648	1353429	No, they're announcing one song next week.
1353789	1358630	And they're going to continually announce songs each coming week.
1359070	1373094	So next Wednesday, okay, I believe it's the 9th, they will have the next song for DDR Max 3, which I've heard is going to be Let Them Move.
1375051	1375952	Okay.
1377013	1379195	Saying rave in the chatroom doesn't count.
1379275	1381176	It has to be in the studio, so quit it.
1383158	1385680	Jamie, quit playing with the ferret.
1389644	1394788	There's celebration in the chatroom saying, yay, I won't fail Oni courses with 3.1 anymore because non-stops are back.
1394828	1396870	Yay!
1397170	1398611	What song do you think will be announced?
1398791	1400713	What do you think the first Oni original will be?
1402615	1402875	V?
1402895	1402915	V?
1404457	1406799	I think it's going to be V. That's where my money is.
1408480	1411903	I would hope, I'm praying, that it's Instant Love.
1412443	1413484	Yes, Instant Love!
1413504	1417307	Hey, I'll have you know, I voted for that.
1417467	1420549	So, if it is, I'd be so pleased.
1420589	1421010	It used to be me.
1421110	1422110	Instant Love, clear cookies.
1422211	1423151	Instant Love, clear cookies.
1423231	1424152	Instant Love, clear cookies.
1424452	1426974	I swear to God, I'm such a fucking retard, okay?
1427254	1428775	I went to the site to vote for a song.
1429096	1430477	I voted for Flotation.
1431638	1432959	Flotation.
1435092	1436093	The Beginning of a Prologue
1454783	1455564	Ooh.
1455604	1458208	Second mix represents the beginning of Naoki.
1459470	1460412	What about first mix?
1460552	1461874	Was that not Naoki?
1462555	1463656	See, I've been saying this.
1463676	1465579	Because I'm brilliant to you.
1465639	1466561	Naoki in a dress.
1468103	1469405	Ah, man Naoki.
1469445	1469665	Okay.
1470419	1477125	So, because of Brilliant To You, a song which quickly gained support of DDR players during its production.
1477185	1478126	This is the best song ever.
1478246	1481409	That's because it was like one of the eight songs on second mix.
1482590	1487174	Anyways, so, gained the support of DDR players during the production.
1487374	1494140	In respect to music producer who played a large part in its production, you credited the song in your own name, Naoki.
1495379	1497160	Okay, is he talking in third person now?
1497500	1499460	Okay, the song expresses you perfectly.
1499680	1503261	It's the kind of song that makes a very pleasant sensation.
1503962	1508603	As if the bewitched melody of synths is flowing from the very center of your body.
1508703	1518706	I have to interrupt for a second just to say, if you don't like second mix, if second mix does not own your soul, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you a hundred times over.
1518846	1521287	Second mix is ownage.
1521727	1523848	Jamie and I say so, therefore it is true.
1524128	1524368	The end.
1524722	1527405	And because we're on the radio, you have to believe everything you hear.
1527725	1529226	Strictly business, like what?
1529747	1531589	No, brilliancy, orchestra, groove.
1532630	1534692	Fucking tub thumping, that's all I have to say.
1534772	1536693	Best freestyle ever.
1537234	1537654	Fuck you.
1539016	1542759	Anyways, I'll never forget the pleasant sensation held by this song.
1543320	1545061	And so I try to continue...
1546989	1548489	I tried to continue reproducing it.
1548669	1552750	Incidentally, next time I feel I achieved this was in Dynamite Rave.
1552850	1553850	That's no surprise.
1554730	1555571	That's no surprise.
1555671	1555991	Uh-oh.
1556671	1558471	We did say Rave.
1558851	1559651	Uh-oh.
1559711	1560551	Oh, yes.
1560891	1561652	You said Rave.
1562572	1563412	Oh, yeah.
1563512	1564492	Oh, man.
1564512	1565872	This is so sweet.
1565992	1566332	Oh, yeah.
1567013	1567193	Oh.
1567413	1570033	Oh, I'm seeing so many colors, man.
1570273	1570673	This DJ.
1570713	1571833	Oh, I love the DJ.
1572113	1573114	Oh, praise the DJ.
1573394	1573654	Oh, man.
1573674	1574254	Oh, fuck.
1579690	1581971	Wait, what the hell just happened?
1582771	1584712	We have a word of the day.
1584752	1586693	We have a word of the day.
1586813	1596137	And whenever the word is said, we play that song, coming to a USA mix near you, and have our own little... The magic word is rave.
1604740	1606921	Leave now, save yourselves.
1609122	1611063	Anyway, back to the Naughty Diary.
1611123	1612184	Back to where I was going here.
1612864	1613865	Well, let's see here.
1614445	1619808	Since the second mix, music technology hasn't advanced, but your range of songs is much wider.
1620268	1631415	Listening to the soundtrack... Your stupid rave stuff is throwing me... He said it, he said it!
1632375	1633076	What the hell?
1633116	1633436	Wait.
1635617	1636297	What happened?
1636438	1636858	Oh my...
1638772	1641396	from now on it's just going to be called Dynamite R3
1651366	1652127	Sounds good, okay.
1652687	1653707	Alright, let's see here.
1653808	1658870	Listening to the soundtrack now, how do you think that has evolved since these early roots?
1658950	1666175	Looking back and reflecting on music, second mix, it brings to mind songs like Higher, Baby Give Me Your Love from fourth mix.
1666215	1668316	In fact, these songs feel like second mix.
1669377	1671798	I haven't really noticed any... Okay, whatever.
1672098	1674920	Anyways, there's a strong connection between the music in these two games.
1674940	1676721	Yeah, because it's the same game.
1677121	1678242	It's the same guy making it.
1679303	1683027	Anyways, time has shown that Second Mix was a huge success.
1683367	1685991	The Second Mix soundtrack CD sold over 550,000 copies, all for Butterfly.
1691570	1694913	Yes, all for Butterfly and that Dynamite R3.
1695774	1698276	Anyway, so with the success of... Third mix.
1698556	1699136	Whatever.
1699917	1704221	With the success of second mix, Lifting My Spirits, everything seemed to pass very quickly.
1704761	1710226	And before I knew it, I was working on solo bass mix, third mix, and True Kiss Destinations all at once.
1710586	1712568	DDR was really starting to take off.
1712728	1714009	Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1714910	1716691	What did he write for True Kiss Destination?
1716751	1717792	Wasn't that all their own stuff?
1719140	1723407	True Kiss Destination had Sexy Planet and Celebrate Night.
1723928	1724730	I got it backwards.
1724810	1728256	I thought that the other one, Dreams Come True, had the Naoki tracks in it.
1728988	1730349	Ah, Dreams Come True sucks.
1731070	1732211	But it was a good Beatmania mix.
1732871	1733472	Good point.
1733572	1736234	Very good point made in the chat room.
1736254	1739256	550,000 sold, 1 billion pirated.
1743460	1746522	Anyways, some more stuff about the non-stop.
1747183	1756370	They've got, it's going to be four songs in one chorus, a life gauge, just like normal non-stops, and it looks like the highest score you can get is 100 million points.
1756470	1757451	How many pirated copies?
1757471	1758332	The second mixer award.
1758352	1758612	Thank you.
1759737	1761418	Hey, I had mine on Dreamcast.
1761438	1765861	I'm sure that guy that holds the world record is going to get 101 million.
1766362	1767102	Oh, yeah, dude.
1767322	1774347	Our Twin Galaxies world record holder is going to get 300 points, and he's going to be the fucking world record holder.
1774929	1779012	And then there's, okay, and then on Naoki's little journal there's some other crap.
1779312	1781093	I don't know what it is about.
1781413	1784375	It looks like how you play with freeze arrows or something.
1784555	1786317	It's how to dance like Naoki.
1787637	1787998	You okay?
1789058	1789699	You're gonna find what?
1789959	1790960	Oh, you're gonna find the translator?
1791040	1792341	Do you want me to go to break or something?
1793161	1799086	Yeah, but it looks like it has something to do with the use of freeze arrows, like how they're inputted into the game.
1799306	1801488	I'll try to come back with a translation of this after our next break.
1801508	1802769	It's pointless information.
1802869	1803489	No one cares.
1803569	1807693	We can see by what Afro is doing, he is playing with a blank screen.
1807753	1809694	So obviously he's not too smart to begin with.
1810115	1812256	So we don't really care what's going on there either.
1812376	1817140	Then they have some stupid like, oh, this is a logo for Secret Rendezvous that didn't make the game.
1817541	1818401	Oh, cry.
1818641	1819142	Don't care.
1819502	1819782	Okay.
1820043	1820403	Sniff.
1821687	1823869	I kinda like that logo, it looks like it's pavement.
1825210	1827152	Like this game is hitting the pavement.
1827552	1830215	Pavement, girls on couch.
1831396	1833878	Pavement, girls on couch.
1833898	1834679	It's a country couch!
1835560	1836541	Girls on pavement.
1838001	1839061	Now you're getting somewhere.
1840382	1843483	Their house could have pavement on the floor, okay?
1844063	1847245	They didn't show the floor, they just showed the couch with the girls.
1848185	1848585	So there.
1850506	1853047	It can be like, wait, it can be like Night at the Roxbury.
1853447	1854928	They have the inside-out nightclub.
1855268	1858529	And then they have, I almost said it, but I didn't.
1859966	1860306	What?
1860546	1861347	What did you all just say?
1861387	1862327	No, no, no, wait, hold on, hold on.
1863067	1868129	Because that logo that you see before you start the song, I think that's what this was supposed to be.
1868349	1874471	And you know, like, before you start the song, all the logo is, it just says, you know, Secret Rendezvous written in the neon thing, and then, you know, Divas.
1874951	1877692	So I don't know, in that aspect, I think that logo's kind of cool.
1877712	1879673	At least it has a little arrow drawn on it or something.
1879693	1882734	It's not that plain, but... But the lesbian video rules.
1884635	1885275	Yeah.
1885815	1887896	Lesbian video rocks.
1889306	1898655	Anyway, so just, we'll have to stay tuned for next, uh, for Wednesday, actually, for Nike Journal 3, where he'll be talking about what he has for breakfast, and... His new underwear.
1898955	1899056	Yeah.
1899076	1899576	Pauly Terry.
1899996	1903580	Pauly, Pauly, Pauly Terry, and how he stalks her, and...
1908166	1910247	I got the idea from my good friend, Mickey.
1910688	1914950	Now, obviously, we slept together, and not together, you know what I mean?
1915290	1917752	Because I don't swing that way.
1920013	1923776	Speaking of secret rendezvous, we're going to kind of transition to another topic here.
1924356	1933442	As you probably know, the original PlayStation Magazine demo of DDR Max USA hit shelves this week, and one of the songs in it
1934856	1936577	is Secret Rendezvous.
1936857	1941719	Now, one of our pals in the chat room, JB, took a really interesting picture.
1941739	1942720	I want to show you guys.
1942920	1944020	Shit, I already lost the link.
1944301	1949163	JB, post that link in the chat room once you hear the picture so I can show that.
1949183	1950644	And then everybody in the chat room can see it too.
1950984	1955126	It's just a really funny picture about the demo.
1955226	1957247	I want to show you guys as soon as JB posts the link here.
1957587	1959988	Hopefully he's not a minute lagged like some of the people in our chat room.
1961357	1962678	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1993143	1995305	Yeah, now what do you have to say about the lesbian thing?
1995345	1996586	Because they are secret lovers.
1997587	1998768	I knew it all along.
1998908	1999969	Sheesh.
2001831	2002251	Anyway.
2002732	2003112	You know what?
2003132	2003613	You know what?
2003633	2003973	Wait a minute.
2004013	2004353	Wait a minute.
2005975	2007476	Glenn raises a very good point.
2007736	2008756	What the fuck are we saying?
2008796	2010276	That's not even in alphabetical order.
2010356	2013397	That picture is obviously photoshopped by somebody, right?
2014017	2014437	Wouldn't it be?
2017198	2018138	Or they thought it was funny too.
2018158	2019499	Yeah, that would have to be photoshopped.
2020279	2021419	Let me take a look.
2021479	2023540	Boy, we're easily fooled on this show.
2023580	2026440	Yeah, it's got to be photoshopped because E doesn't come after L. Maybe not.
2030351	2032351	It would also be funny if it was ESL.
2032371	2034792	Yeah, ESL, you know.
2035792	2039573	Because most of the people at Konami must be taking ESL.
2042493	2043473	They teach it in high school.
2044173	2045334	Maybe they're all still in high school.
2045394	2054815	Anyways, yeah, so one of the things that they did with this Max demo is they hacked into it and found the song list.
2055215	2055695	Hooray.
2056216	2058036	So we actually have the song list.
2058076	2058196	Well...
2059156	2062478	It's debatable, and this is a huge debate.
2062498	2064339	We're not going to get it resolved on this show.
2064379	2066139	There's people saying, yes, that's the list.
2066159	2067880	There's people saying, no, that's not the list.
2067940	2068861	And yes, that's the list.
2069221	2070341	And no, that's not the list.
2070381	2073143	And yes, that's... You know, it just keeps going back and forth.
2073303	2074624	But... What?
2074804	2075064	Theory?
2075564	2076524	Okay, let's hear the theory.
2076604	2077545	Let's hear an interesting theory.
2078084	2081985	DSCS SoCalKick says that it is fake.
2082286	2082606	Again.
2082766	2083786	Yes, it's the list!
2084046	2085006	No, it's not the list.
2085066	2085967	Yes, it's the list!
2086667	2088768	And DJ Konami says, no, it's not.
2089168	2093769	Why don't we just put in the demo and try it ourselves?
2094070	2094810	That's what I'm saying.
2094890	2097891	Okay, supposedly, here's how they got the list, okay?
2098391	2103834	They went in to the XA file, which is the PlayStation audio format, you know, that they use.
2104454	2110757	Now, in those, you can actually listen to the small little samples of sounds that'll play when you select a certain song.
2111218	2116260	Now, supposedly, since they hurried to get this demo done so fast, they didn't bother to cut that out.
2116360	2120683	I mean, most average people are going to go, oh, I'm going to go hack into this and go listen for songs.
2121243	2123184	So, what happened was that someone did that.
2124150	2128273	Which just proves that people that play DDR are sick fucking people.
2129014	2132896	Yeah, so what happened... For any demo they're going to do, they're just going to lock out the other stuff.
2133437	2133977	Or remove it.
2134397	2138060	So, what they did was they went in there and actually listened to all that.
2138120	2139901	Now, I'm not sure if there was an actual song list.
2140002	2142023	I don't believe that there was an actual song list there.
2142323	2145646	But perhaps they identified stuff based off of what they heard on there.
2145966	2151730	I mean, some of them obviously pretty obvious, like Sandstorm and, you know, stuff like that.
2152210	2152471	So...
2153917	2182832	I opened up a file in a notepad there was some file in there that you could open up a notepad and it shows you a big list and it looked like every single freaking song that's ever been in DDR like it was for either some kind of append or it was like all the four letter edit codes which that's what I thought it was it was all the four letter edit codes because it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that that I know are not going to be in Max that things are not going to be in Max USA but it also had new stuff it had the short long trip in there and it had I Like To Move It it had a remix of Dynamite Rave
2184914	2187197	and it had, oh yeah, I'm sorry, I said rave.
2190842	2193265	Oh yeah, oh yeah, this rave is heavy.
2194927	2195128	Anyway.
2196909	2197749	But that wasn't in there.
2197849	2198450	That song.
2198710	2201531	Sandstorm was not in that list, which I thought was interesting.
2201611	2202251	So I don't know.
2202651	2207072	I don't think anyone at Konami is intentionally messing with us.
2207472	2208773	I don't think that's the case.
2209093	2212034	So if somebody's saying that list is planted, I think it's BS.
2212074	2215795	I think somebody at Konami just got lazy, but I don't think it was a finished version.
2215815	2218556	Gee, Konami be lazy on a DDR mix.
2218596	2223578	Keep in mind that for demos, it's often made off of the working copy.
2224478	2232562	In the USA, hmm... You know, as an example, I had a demo for Umjir Marlami when it was being released in the US and they hadn't finished all their translation.
2232942	2251190	Well, you can only play, you know, maybe two levels in it, but when I went into the XA files, it had the, um... I don't know how many people played Umjir Marlami, but there was a level that was changed from Japanese to the US, which was she's playing in hell instead of on an island for the Teriyaki Yoko stage, but on that it had the Japanese version for the song lyrics.
2252110	2252911	and so on and so forth.
2274426	2275927	Then I would have to go and believe it.
2276368	2280833	Now some of the things that surprised me on there, well for one is let them move.
2282415	2283536	Why is that still there?
2283877	2286981	I don't know, but I'm assuming they'll probably take that out.
2287021	2290585	But then again, here's another thing that we have to understand when we're looking at this list.
2291005	2292707	Even if there were all those short samples,
2293628	2301893	Remember back in Extra Mix, there was Petite Love, the short little sample for that, and the banner, and the background stuff, but the song wasn't in there.
2302373	2304634	So it's possible some of this stuff might be cut out.
2304934	2317061	Very true, and didn't somebody else hack USA Mix and actually found that there's backgrounds in USA Mix for Butterfly, Bad Girls, and mostly the stuff that they cut out of Best Hits, although I gotta say...
2317541	2322564	The one that was really interesting was Bad Girls because they actually found an image of the background without the gun.
2322904	2324344	And Bad Girls wasn't in Best Hits either.
2324645	2332088	They also, using a game shark, were able to have it pull up open spots for songs.
2332889	2333629	Yeah.
2333789	2338191	Well, here's my theory on why there's so many songs listed on this thing.
2338892	2340592	Now, especially Let Them Move.
2340752	2342373	Now, this is what made me wonder about this.
2343054	2345675	Because they guaranteed that Let Them Move would not be in this new mix.
2346639	2366287	Now, before they were talking about appending this with Konomics, and if you notice, on the list, which we haven't really kind of revealed the list yet, but, you know, if you've seen it on the sites, it has pretty much, I haven't confirmed this by actually going down the list with Konomics and DDR Max USA, but they're almost identical as far as the old stuff that they have.
2366887	2372129	So, my guess would be that you can actually append Konomics with Max USA.
2372249	2380853	Now, I don't know if it will allow stuff to be playable, but that would probably be why they have the short samples on there for that.
2381766	2388668	We're going to find the list, but we're not going to really read the whole list for you guys, because obviously there's still some tricks to it.
2388708	2389728	It's not the final list.
2390108	2399650	Basically, we're not going to know until either A, Konami tells us, B, a respectable, reputable gaming site lets us know the information, or C, we have the hot little game in our hands.
2400190	2403311	So we'll read off.
2403351	2409052	What I do want to read off on that list is the new stuff, the new songs that they've discovered, because I'm guessing...
2410003	2411624	That's probably going to be the most accurate.
2411724	2414985	Why would they have information for new songs if they're not going to be in there after all?
2415245	2417426	But the old stuff, I'm guessing, is not accurate.
2417446	2421928	Things like Ghosts, I have a very hard time believing Ghosts is going to actually be in Max USA.
2422028	2422688	I could be wrong.
2423308	2424829	I would love it if Ghosts made it in Max USA.
2424849	2431812	That's one of my very favorite DDR songs of all time, but I'm thinking it might be some kind of copy over for Max for Japanese.
2431912	2432192	Who knows?
2433226	2433526	That's the...
2452945	2462209	Stoke Out Kicks sent me the hacked text file, but again, what I'm seeing on this list, it looks like codes for every song that you see, but you see things in here listed in here.
2462229	2465030	This is that part of the text file that had all these things.
2465651	2475735	You see things that I just don't believe are going to be in Max USA, like Captain Jack Grandio makes Mr. Wonderful, but look, you see these little three-letter codes before each one.
2476295	2488088	Like FLAS for Flashdance, AFRO for Afronova I think that might have something to do with some kind of append mode or edit mode, I don't know But, who knows You know what?
2488328	2497618	No, Flashdance is not Konami, it's just not Konami original We should take the import version and see if they also have similar things We'll probably, we'll look at that later, but I do want to read these new ones that are showing up in there, because
2498524	2499785	Okay, I'll tell you what those things are.
2500346	2511034	A lot of times for writing code, instead of having to write the huge long name out every single time, they'll give it like basically another name for it or shorten it up.
2511414	2520121	So for instance, when you have like, let's see, Together and Forever, they'll shorten it down to T-O-G-E instead of having to write Together and Forever every single time.
2520322	2521663	It makes coding a lot smaller.
2522423	2523104	So that's what that is.
2524278	2528001	So, some new songs we see in here that we haven't seen in DDR yet.
2528041	2548035	We've got Jam & Marmalade, Logical Dash, Look to the Sky, True Color Mix, Overblast, which has been confirmed, Peace Out, I'm For Real, The Shining Polaris, that's one I'm looking forward to, Drop the Bomb, the System SF mix, which by the way has been sent to me by JB in the chat room, so maybe we'll play that later.
2549028	2564297	Dynamite R, the Downbird Soda Mix, Take It To The Morning Light, extended vocal version, You Leave Me Alone, Dark Black Forest, Short Trip, Nemesis, cool, Ain't It Good, the original vocal mix, M2 Step, version 1.01, 22 Dunk, 511, Abyss,
2568047	2569988	Baby, Baby, Gimme Your Love, and I Like To Move It.
2570008	2574991	Well, that's Baby, Baby, yeah, some of those, so I don't know, something's mixed together.
2575852	2579754	There's some other ones on there, too, that you didn't mention up at the top there.
2581095	2581635	Let's see here.
2582375	2587218	There's one of them that's going to be, well, Look To The Sky, True Color Mix is going to be in there.
2588059	2591120	Another one was, let's see, what the hell is that?
2592721	2593102	I don't know.
2593142	2593662	Na Ha Ha?
2594193	2599496	It's DUM-S-Naha Requiem Mix, whatever the hell that is.
2599996	2602197	Orion Civilization, is that a remix?
2602217	2603318	I don't know.
2603858	2607980	Anyways, it looks like possibly an Orion 78 remix.
2610402	2614404	Anyways, DarkBlackForce, of course, you mentioned there's a...
2615004	2616365	Let's see, you mentioned Drop the Bomb.
2616385	2620327	There's a Do It Right remix, too, that's in there.
2620347	2621127	The Stat Battle Modes.
2621768	2622488	Where the hell is that?
2622508	2624569	Keep on moving and let them move Stat Battle Modes in.
2624589	2625529	What do we got in there?
2625549	2625990	Second mix.
2626570	2630172	Let's see here.
2630512	2632573	Again, I think it's just a list of codes.
2632973	2636135	The only things I see interesting about this are the new songs.
2636535	2641177	I don't think this list shows us, it really shows us what songs are going to be in Max.
2641217	2642058	It's some kind of...
2642578	2644180	Who's in here that says, do it right, harmonize, step next.
2655256	2659860	Feel the beat Feel the beat's not listed either So we know it's missing something
2684702	2686444	So, it's got to be a work in process.
2689308	2696477	So... But it is pretty interesting and it does open up a lot of possibilities for things we might see.
2697098	2697739	Alright, cool.
2698279	2699821	What else do you want to talk about, Max?
2700262	2701023	I played the demo.
2702384	2705106	Let's talk about being a measure off, shall we?
2705347	2707789	Oh my god, what happened?
2707869	2710291	Why look to the sky and let the bee hit him a measure off?
2710811	2713133	And it's even a trick, they were too.
2713353	2719058	Rumor is that somehow an old version of the demo got put on the demo disc.
2719478	2725863	That they actually released a fix to the PlayStation Magazine people, but they put the wrong one on there.
2726144	2727445	I'll be getting it later too.
2728826	2729827	I don't know, it seems kind of...
2730908	2732369	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2757674	2759055	No, not Secret Rendezvous, what am I saying?
2759295	2759395	Oh.
2759996	2762938	Well, other than the fact that I don't like playing Secret Rendezvous.
2764338	2769762	Here's another one that I found pretty interesting, and I'm all... Damn it, I gotta say the damn name.
2770062	2775446	It's R. Okay, Dynamite R3 Down Bird Sota Mix.
2777427	2783271	Hey, I'm... Let's start going on... Either way, we're effed, because we're getting a Dynamite R remix.
2783351	2783731	Reap!
2783751	2783951	Reap!
2783971	2784271	Reap!
2784311	2784552	Reap!
2784592	2784832	Reap!
2784892	2785112	Reap!
2785172	2785412	Reap!
2796954	2801936	We might, maybe we'll get to hear it at some point, I don't know You guys want to hear the Drop the Bomb mix that I got?
2802396	2823144	I think we should go ahead and play it We're going to play it, we'll play the Drop the Bomb mix And then we're going to talk a little bit about We'll talk about 8th Style or something We're not going to go into full break, I'm just going to play this one song I've got the Drop the Bomb mix, I'm going to play it for you guys Oh, it's just the clip, I thought it was a full song Ah, shit, alright, well then We get to hear the clip, alright, here we go
2837580	2838341	That's pretty cool.
2838381	2839081	That is pretty cool.
2839262	2839882	Oh, man.
2839942	2841804	It's all going, it's going trancy.
2842104	2843205	You know what Max is going to be?
2844406	2846588	DDR Max is going to be one giant rave.
2849071	2849871	Alright, alright.
2850892	2852254	I know, I'm going to, okay.
2853154	2860221	I've been wishing, I mean, I kind of like Dynamite R3, but I've been hoping that they do a trance remix of that.
2860660	2866382	Please be a trance remix and not some goddamn awful speed mix or bass mix.
2867323	2868463	Trance remix.
2868543	2869203	That's what I want.
2869283	2871124	Dude, we need more booty music in DDR.
2871204	2871944	There wasn't enough.
2872985	2874806	I would like to see some solo bass stuff.
2874826	2877887	The booty music in... I want my baby mama.
2878407	2878707	I know.
2878787	2882328	I want to... You know, there would be trouble for that, though, because... Well, I don't know.
2882408	2883849	It's probably bubble domain by now.
2885110	2885670	Think about it.
2886150	2887410	So... Who that is?
2887771	2888451	My baby mama.
2889739	2890442	Maybe that'll be next.
2890502	2894094	Next week, every time somebody says the word booty, we'll get into playing My Baby Mama.
2894194	2894656	That'll be fun.
2895461	2901245	At least we're not screaming like they're doing on... You know, it just makes me a little bit upset about my old dead computer, the fact that I had the XA player and the XA to MP3 converter too.
2901285	2904708	I would need to get all that stuff again, and then I could make them myself.
2924402	2926524	We love you all, listeners, for giving us the stuff.
2927565	2929286	Oh, yes, Loki.
2929706	2930307	Are we going to break?
2931503	2932184	Let's break stuff.
2932704	2935467	Should I be doing my little intro to this song here?
2936107	2937969	I want to talk about 8th Style.
2938269	2940551	So we'll talk more about 8th Style for the break.
2940631	2941131	8th Style.
2941332	2943734	But let's talk about 2DX 8th Style.
2943774	2945895	We've got one new song's been revealed.
2946176	2947417	Actually, two new songs have been revealed.
2947797	2954903	And those are the super secret hidden tracks, which apparently... I don't know if this is 100%... You have to meet DJ Lisu to get them.
2954943	2958046	Yeah, you have to basically kick the crap out of Agapa and Lisu.
2958086	2958186	No.
2958686	2959086	You've got to...
2960566	2963989	Triple A, a Flashing 7 song on hard.
2964770	2966591	And then you get to play a song called Sakura.
2966931	2967732	Doesn't that make you happy?
2967792	2968913	I'll never get to play that, Donald.
2969173	2969413	Jamie.
2970394	2971095	So you get that.
2972556	2977600	And then if you can Triple A that, if you can Triple A Sakura, you get a Mr. T song called Xeno on.
2977700	2979262	Like I said, you have to be DJ Lisu.
2979782	2981544	And we're going to play those songs for you right now.
2981644	2986568	But Loki has a very interesting theory about Sakura, which is a song by Revenge.
2987489	2987749	Okay.
2988750	2988930	Now...
2989844	2992766	I found this link the other day, you know, to find this song.
2992946	2997129	I listened to it, and I was like, oh my god, this is Max Unlimited.
2997530	2999751	This song is a remix of Max Unlimited.
2999871	3004234	No one is saying it is, except for me, but it's a goddamn remix of Max Unlimited.
3004675	3008998	It has the same bassline as Max Unlimited, almost identical to Max Unlimited.
3009458	3012760	I mean, if you listen to the key sounds of it, it has the exact same bass line.
3012980	3018502	Listen to Max Enigma to get what I'm saying, because that's all he has playing in the background is the bass line.
3019002	3024345	It has the exact same bass line, plus it's actually got a spot where they could put freezes.
3024945	3030608	Now, what's interesting is, remember when they were talking about Max to the XXXM, and how they said there's going to be two freezes in it?
3030688	3033469	There's two spots in this song that could put freezes for it.
3034521	3042126	Also, another thing is there's a part where it speeds up and you'll actually hear the drum that's in the background of Max Unlimited and also the bassline too.
3042306	3047208	And at the very end of the song, there's a spot where it goes that dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, you know, that type of thing.
3047268	3047489	Right.
3047669	3048469	It's got that there.
3048789	3054313	Now, don't be thrown off by the fact that it's got that twangy shit from, you know, Cigaru and all that stuff.
3054613	3055994	That's just typical revenge blabber.
3056034	3058715	First of all, it's not twangy shit.
3058875	3059776	It's traditional...
3060536	3062378	Thanks for watching!
3072893	3075535	All this fucking internet rumor shit is really pissing me off.
3075615	3081058	So some dumbass Japanese guy over there comes up, Oh, this sounds like a good name for the next Max.
3081378	3082319	And then puts it out there.
3082599	3087622	Some idiot copies that list, and then more idiots copy that list, and then people start taking that for fact.
3087702	3088823	And then we copy it.
3088843	3090064	You hear it here first on Orange Launch.
3090144	3090404	I'm kidding.
3090664	3091905	I never said that that was a song.
3091945	3093346	That was the dumbest name ever.
3093806	3096968	Sakura, okay, I am going to put my money on this song.
3097128	3099550	This is going to be the next Max song.
3100071	3102913	DJ Kanami would like to welcome you to the internet, Loki.
3102933	3104414	When it comes to the rumors.
3123971	3126253	Sakura is a Japanese folk song with the Max bassline.
3141261	3151363	I played it for my fiance, Dan, the other night, and he even mentioned that he heard it in another game that had a level that had traditional music playing in the background.
3151684	3157505	And actually, coming to think of it, I do remember hearing it before, so that's why I'm personally a little bit iffy about that theory.
3158405	3163007	However, I wouldn't put it beyond them to make that a bonus.
3163627	3166888	Now, how much money are you putting on this, Loki?
3167651	3169172	I don't know, I didn't say anything about money.
3169733	3172955	You said you're putting your money on this, that Sakura's going to be the hidden song.
3172976	3175438	My credibility, how about that?
3175678	3176338	Your dignity?
3177119	3177759	Yes, dignity.
3178100	3178940	And here's another thing.
3179081	3180662	It's 150 beats per minute.
3181362	3183724	Oh wait, double that, and what have we got?
3183744	3183724	300!
3186106	3187648	Oh, didn't see that one coming.
3188689	3189489	I mean, come on.
3190170	3193853	Do we need any more clues that this is going to be the next Max song?
3194557	3198780	Okay, or if it's not, then they did a really shitty-ass job with creating a new song.
3198840	3202282	Hmm, let's just take the bass line from this one and throw some other stuff on top of it.
3202422	3203123	Oh, new song.
3203403	3203843	There we go.
3205104	3206065	I say let's just play it.
3206845	3212489	Okay, uh, we... First off, we did get that clip of Dynamite Ray we were talking about earlier.
3212769	3213310	Uh-oh!
3213550	3214050	Uh-oh!
3214070	3215231	Oh, shit, I said the word, didn't I?
3215291	3215731	My bad.
3216192	3216672	My bad.
3220975	3221635	Woo!
3222256	3222896	Oh, my gosh!
3223176	3224237	This tastes like aspirin.
3228143	3230286	We got this clip of the Dynamite R song.
3230426	3234952	Now, I'm being told, though, that it's kind of messed up and kind of scratchy and it's going to mess up.
3235253	3238578	We haven't screened this yet, so we're just going to play it live on air for the first time.
3239078	3242383	It might be effed up, but it's only 15 seconds, so deal with it, okay?
3242423	3242724	Here we go.
3257947	3258927	Yeah, sounds like Naoki to me.
3260748	3262188	Double your pleasure, double your fun.
3262348	3262849	Fuck twins.
3263049	3270131	I, I don't, don't wanna, wanna give, give up, up, throw, throw up, up, rave.
3270511	3274853	It's Dynamite, Dynamite Rave Stutter Mix.
3277494	3278374	Alright, enough of that.
3279952	3286454	Yeah, minus the fact that it was double your pleasure, double your fun time, it sounded a little bit trancy, and you might be getting your wish.
3287034	3288654	It's a little fat, more like a KOG man.
3288674	3292135	No, all they need to do... It sounded like frickin' Eurobeat.
3292376	3300158	All they need to do is just slow it down, you know like when you're listening to the song in 2DX and you put it in training mode and slow it down all the way?
3300678	3303719	It sounds like a Ska song, they should do Dynamite or Ska.
3303739	3307580	I don't wanna give up...
3308777	3310838	All right, let's get to those songs from 8th style.
3310858	3316600	We're going to start this off with Sakura, and then we're going to get to the special, super special stage, Mr. T with Xenoine.
3316941	3322823	After that, we're going to completely change gears, and we're going to hear a Gak song, because Jamie demands it.
3323043	3323704	That sounds good to me.
3323724	3328566	The Gak song is, by the way, the one that made it into Guitar Freak's 8th mix.
3329066	3330366	It's Another World.
3331027	3331207	And...
3332128	3335773	Okay kids, you can send me your FUs of the week over messages in the chat room.
3335793	3340318	We'll get to those in the next bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3442641	3443523	Thanks for watching!
3498487	3499289	Thanks for watching!
3550206	3555208	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
3556008	3559849	Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
3560309	3567271	Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.

3591377	3592178	Thank you for watching!
3618292	3624162	Yume Nara Samenai De Kono Sora No Mukou E You Can't See Another World
3633533	3634834	The roadside is full of hurtful souls.
3634854	3636295	The broken taxi, you are beautiful.
3636315	3637917	We exchange words and we cry together.
3637957	3639278	Gently embraced by the pain of love.
3655878	3656859	Thank you for watching!

3721045	3721946	Thank you for watching!
3768488	3776870	Hiho, Kermit the VOG here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
3776911	3782852	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3783632	3789474	You're just going to go up the street, and you're going to make a right at the Shell Station, and you're going to... Watch out for the drop-off.
3790014	3792295	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3793155	3795676	Hey you, you five-year-old, you give me your lunch money.
3797583	3798143	I got you!
3804828	3807150	We taking Jamie on down to Sesame Street.
3810452	3811813	No, no, no more.
3812173	3812714	No more.
3812774	3813454	He said it, he said it.
3813534	3815116	It didn't get picked up on microphone.
3815136	3815956	We can't play it.
3816517	3818138	If it didn't get picked up on microphone, we can't...
3824812	3830995	Hey, you know what I'm learning how to do though?
3831015	3835717	I'm learning how to hit the buttons right on the keyboard so I can bring up that raise thing right away.
3841320	3841720	Anyway.
3843742	3846163	Our chatroom cries every time we do that, by the way.
3847264	3847965	We love you guys.
3848085	3854669	Our chatroom just gets, you know, every time that somebody says the R word, the chatroom just gets completely out of hand.
3854709	3857411	They just all at once, they just start getting into it.
3857431	3859472	They just start, you know, yelling out in the chatroom.
3859492	3863415	They just all start crying.
3863455	3864496	They all start crying.
3867258	3867938	Oh, I said it.
3868779	3868919	Oh.
3869840	3870280	You bitch.
3872523	3873564	This is never gonna get old.
3874685	3874966	Never.
3897594	3897894	Thank you.
3898955	3902456	Next week's show for October the 13th.
3902997	3903777	Oh, lucky day there.
3904137	3906098	October the 13th show will be pre-taped.
3907779	3909720	So we're not going to be doing it live here in studio.
3909760	3912241	So don't come to the house next Sunday because we won't be here.
3912761	3913562	We're going to pre-tape.
3915102	3917443	We are going to pre-tape, I don't know where.
3917463	3918724	We're doing Scandia?
3919004	3919424	Scandia.
3919624	3920605	Thursday night, I think?
3922219	3922919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3946754	3948935	Hey, if you want to be a special guest, show up.
3948955	3949856	And give me a dollar!
3949996	3950156	Indeed.
3966395	3974062	and now I write to you with open eyes I put that song on repeat the other night
3991445	3997967	Okay, for people who actually read my live journal, I'm going to have to have that as my live journal song for the night.
3998567	3999768	Okay, good deal.
4000328	4004649	And we'll have to do our own little guilty pleasure set soon, some week.
4004669	4007730	We're going to have to do our DDR 2DX guilty pleasures.
4009090	4011071	Okay, right now I'm commissioning somebody.
4011691	4012811	Make me this remix.
4013432	4017653	Make me Dynamite thingy mixed with R5.
4020501	4021202	It would sound good.
4021582	4022663	Dynamite R5.
4023664	4024525	Dynamite R5.
4025225	4029729	So would that be... Yeah, okay.
4030510	4033272	Yes, Thursday is going to be all about Retro Edit Day.
4034173	4036975	I'm going to bring back all the old Fourth Mix edits that I had.
4037256	4037696	Cool.
4038457	4039738	Retro Edit Day, hell yeah.
4040518	4044060	If I could come, but I probably can't, because it's school.
4044360	4044880	Uh-oh.
4045580	4052603	No, I would totally play all the edits that are already pre-loaded onto the fourth mix machine, like the B4U edit that totally rules.
4053423	4054824	And there are some other ones, too, I forget.
4056145	4058385	Don't forget about the edits that are in my pocket.
4058646	4062467	They have the Stomp to My Beat S-Maniac stuff in there.
4063568	4064028	That's cool.
4066644	4072749	So, live on Thursday, when we tape at Scandia, I'm going to see if I can make this happen, if I can get a video camera by then.
4072790	4085821	For those of you that were listening last week, you heard us bitching and bitching and bitching about these ignorant ignoramuses at TwinGalaxies.com, who do the world record.
4089631	4091052	No more references to USL.
4091092	4093554	I'm not allowed to talk about this show on that show.
4094114	4095035	So we have to limit it.
4095735	4098257	We're going to quote a... Never mind.
4098517	4099298	Travis, you're listening.
4099318	4100298	You know you're cool.
4101419	4104001	But you're an asshole for not letting me talk about DDR on that show.
4104381	4108084	Hey, he talked about Orange Lounge yesterday.
4108877	4110037	Yeah, he made fun of it.
4110418	4112739	But that's still airtime.
4112779	4115239	That's still promo.
4115319	4116680	We're going to do that live.
4116800	4118841	So it'll be rebroadcast next Sunday.
4118921	4122482	If I can get the video camera in time, we will do that over there live.
4122542	4128705	I hope Black Lab can get over there Thursday because I know he's probably going to get the best score out of any of us that I know of that would show up.
4128825	4131085	We just need to do the traveling road show too.
4131126	4135247	We need to do one from Tapioca Express in Davis.
4135267	4135967	We'll find that.
4136468	4137548	Bulba and Orange Lounge.
4137768	4142790	We'll find that bowling alley movie theater in Auburn that has the second mix.
4142950	4143851	How would that be?
4144571	4148093	Yes, this record was shattered in a tapioca express.
4149533	4150454	That would be winner.
4152467	4153188	Think about it.
4153288	4157490	That'd be just like saying, you know, this record was shattered by a paraplegic.
4158591	4160792	I shattered this record while eating squid.
4160912	4165555	Well, the record was also said by like some total moron anyway who made up his own rules.
4166156	4167797	It's like, okay, here are the rules.
4168397	4168918	I win.
4169058	4174241	I'm still thinking we need to critique the rules and send them in and to point out each and every reason why they're wrong and why they're idiots.
4174381	4175722	Rule number seven, I can only win.
4175982	4176542	No one else can win.
4176722	4177003	Just me.
4177983	4178604	By the way, I'm cute.
4180185	4180585	He's ugly.
4182116	4185439	Chatroom is getting their panties in a bunch because we haven't done the FUs yet.
4185960	4188662	So, we're going to do the FUs right now.
4188882	4189803	So, Jamie!
4192646	4194928	I'm just going to let that little thing do the talking for you.
4195248	4196529	You know who else likes that thing?
4197029	4199091	Christy's two-year-old daughter likes that.
4199732	4203435	I just remember having a particular somebody over here humping it.
4204416	4204897	Dude, what?
4206178	4206698	Never mind.
4206718	4208620	What'd Dave do?
4211502	4212924	Dude, you are foul tonight.
4213324	4214005	You're foul.
4214125	4214766	You're gross.
4214926	4215206	Okay.
4215267	4216328	Chili, I'm telling you.
4216368	4217850	The chili in those cheese things.
4219452	4219672	Yeah.
4219752	4219872	I know.
4221094	4221874	I can smell it.
4222115	4223516	Jamie, do you have any FUs of the week?
4224017	4224798	Of course I do.
4224818	4227061	As soon as I think of them.
4227601	4230425	Well, I have my secret FU, which none of you are going to know about.
4234377	4239182	I know, I know, I know the secret FU, I know it, I know it, I'm not telling.
4239302	4243326	For anybody who wants to know what my secret FU is, you know, try to find me online.
4243967	4244247	Try.
4247793	4248333	Found you.
4248993	4252414	You on Orange Lounge every Sunday night, bitch.
4252494	4254735	I just forgot.
4254835	4259356	No, my other FDs that I have, one of them goes toward Voltage.
4259797	4260217	Damn it.
4260517	4261877	You saw me play that song.
4261957	4262217	I did.
4262237	4264658	You saw how damn close I was to that song.
4266018	4266419	Of course, in 78.
4266499	4273401	I have another one that... Dude, I said what my FDs were at the beginning of the show.
4273541	4274441	Damn it, I can't remember.
4275183	4278986	Oh yeah, my other fuck you goes toward, well, it's a kind of, sort of one.
4279566	4282468	I got a job, and I liked being unemployed.
4283249	4284630	I liked living off of my unemployment.
4284690	4286231	Hooray for welfare!
4286651	4288813	I wasn't on welfare, I was on unemployment, it's different.
4289493	4292976	You know, I'm not, you know, pooping out babies just to get another fuck, okay?
4292996	4297319	You know, locking them up in the closet, feeding them, you know...
4298894	4305435	The funny thing is, if you ever did have a kid, you would fight with them over who gets to play Nintendo.
4305455	4306076	You really would.
4306656	4307696	Fuck them, that's mine.
4307756	4308636	I fight for myself.
4309056	4311036	They want theirs, they can earn their money and fight themselves.
4311056	4311497	Hello.
4311977	4320078	Anyway, but you know, my job keeps me so busy and I have hardly any time, so I'm like this zombie during the week, and I came in the zombie today.
4320838	4323319	I found, though, I do have a happy thing.
4323339	4324219	I need happy music.
4325049	4325609	Happy Thing?
4328691	4330131	Happy Music, Happy Music, Happy Music.
4332072	4333853	No, I got Happy Music, I'm just looking for it.
4335574	4338415	Hold on, hold on, I'm looking, I'm looking.
4338435	4343758	I have the perfect song if I can find it.
4345119	4345439	I got it.
4346579	4347660	It's a happy song.
4350362	4350883	Whatever.
4351524	4356792	Anyway, my happy thing is I've discovered a wonderful drink, get a drink to make it work.
4357153	4357914	It makes me hyper.
4358721	4360122	It's called Take the Coffee.
4360142	4370410	When the coffee has been brewed and people have poured and there's about half of the container of coffee left, you pour yourself a cup and add in a pack of hot chocolate.
4371171	4374433	You add in hazelnut creamer and then some sugar.
4374754	4377776	Mix it up and add more coffee and that's instant go-go juice.
4378196	4380218	It makes you hyper for at least two hours.
4380558	4382840	Top that with penguin mints to get rid of the bad breath.
4385442	4386723	I get my work done fast.
4388308	4388708	Fair enough.
4389549	4392371	Any other FUs or BlessUs or whatever we're calling them?
4393292	4398816	Um, well, other than my secret FU, which, because I'm not going to be in as much of a bitch as I was earlier.
4398837	4400598	Um, no.
4401819	4403180	And, you know, fuck that, you know.
4403460	4404701	And fuck Twin Galaxies.
4404781	4406082	I mean, conjoined Twin Galaxies.
4406863	4407764	Okay, fair enough.
4407804	4408304	So fuck them.
4408464	4410406	Fuck them right in their nostril, because they're ass-ache good enough.
4413820	4415682	Okay, their ass ain't good enough.
4415842	4419667	So now we pass the mic on to... I'm going to, no, it's my turn.
4419787	4421188	Oh, fine.
4421309	4422149	My FU's of the week.
4422770	4434023	My own job, who has moved me to a new cube that's half the size of my old one, right in the middle of Fast Lane where everybody walks through, so I can't really exactly get on the internet.
4434583	4436264	Do you have to take phone calls?
4436324	4439326	Well, we're supposed to, but we don't have to if we don't take the call and roll it over to someone else.
4464018	4464318	F-Drama
4491463	4493244	F-Drama, my life is not passions.
4494045	4495686	I am not living in passions land.
4495926	4497807	Why do you make my life feel like passions?
4498748	4501189	Well, let's see.
4501349	4505132	As promised from last week, I said I would have an FU this week.
4506213	4507714	Oh, okay, yes, you have an FU.
4509235	4509415	Now...
4510544	4521654	As much as I'd like to learn how to program my remote control and what to do if there's static on my screen and that kind of stuff, I don't like the fact that Dish Network took away all my channels.
4522748	4527832	I returned on TV this morning and all the channels were locked out because they said that they did not receive payment from us.
4528153	4530194	However, we had already paid them.
4530234	4530775	They suck.
4530855	4537620	I have to use the Dish Network because they suck and I don't care how to program my fucking remote and what the hell it can do.
4538061	4545247	And obviously, if there was static on the screen, I wouldn't know how to get rid of it because I wouldn't be able to see this stupid broadcast about how to get rid of static.
4546508	4547869	God, I hate Dish Network.
4548229	4550951	Although that one chick that's in their commercials has a nice rack.
4552116	4553838	She has a nice rack.
4553858	4554598	Nice, nice rack.
4555639	4556400	You heard it here first.
4556620	4559844	The Chicken and the Dish Network commercial has a nice rack.
4560224	4561405	And now today.
4562146	4562646	Yay.
4562866	4565689	I only have a couple of FUs.
4565829	4567251	You get the same song because I'm lazy.
4567291	4568032	Yeah, okay.
4568072	4568912	I don't want the same song.
4568972	4569173	Alright.
4569193	4570794	My FUs go to 3DX songs that I can't pass.
4575262	4580085	Mainly, Bari, this is a shitty ass song and I hate the crap out of it.
4580625	4582866	And Love is Dreaminess in G2.
4583326	4590350	Love is Dreaminess on 7 star, or 7G and, uh, and the other two on my 7.
4591010	4592011	I can't pass them.
4592031	4592811	They are hard.
4593672	4594392	Very hard.
4596253	4596633	Okay.
4599935	4600055	Oh.
4600755	4601636	Well, we're gonna do, uh,
4602412	4604693	Now we have our request and dedication.
4605433	4608054	Too bad we don't have Casey Kasem here to do it for us.
4611736	4619719	You know, I dedicated the dead airspace on the show to Twin, but I feel kind of bad a little bit, so we're going to dedicate this one song to you.
4621960	4623421	Do you feel special?
4623441	4624461	Do you feel loved?
4624501	4624681	Good.
4632901	4633301	Thank you.
4633581	4634601	Can we get back to the FUs now?
4637682	4637982	All right.
4641403	4641743	Say it!
4641883	4642183	Say it!
4642723	4643063	Say it!
4644423	4645804	I don't want to say the word.
4648804	4650564	It's a bad four-letter word, okay?
4651585	4655185	It's the four-letter R word.
4655365	4657046	What four-letter R words are there?
4658106	4658526	Rave!
4665922	4666942	They knew it was coming.
4667782	4673624	See, it's just funny because every time someone says that, Rob throws his hands up in the air.
4673664	4675644	It's not being a face, it's on a Friday night.
4675844	4676444	It's so funny.
4676864	4678525	Rob starts doing the club hoochie dance.
4680665	4682585	I mean, it's a good thing he's not standing up.
4682886	4684586	I do the I want to get some tonight dance.
4687467	4689447	Okay, we're going to go to the chat room FUs now.
4692933	4696315	Oh my god, some people just wrote some fucking novels tonight, so I'm going to be quick.
4697175	4697736	Black Lab.
4697756	4702078	Well, Black Lab's cool, so I'll let him have all the FUs he wants, because he's whoring out our station.
4702138	4703659	So, excuse me, excuse me, boys.
4703900	4704620	Can I do an FU here?
4704900	4705180	Thank you.
4706061	4708062	You want to share with the rest of the network here?
4708082	4709203	You have enough for everybody!
4709763	4710103	Okay.
4710864	4720710	But yesterday at Pat's party, which was awesome, Loki brought... He's got the massive sim, DDR, DX, or whatever, and...
4721878	4734653	One of the songs is by this one guy, and he basically layered his voice over and over, making all the different noises to songs like ZXY and V. We're going to get to those.
4734673	4735414	Yes, later.
4735935	4736876	So, wait.
4737417	4738598	I now have two microphones.
4740200	4740701	Be scared.
4742162	4744205	and Jimmy, my microphone.
4744866	4745407	He's rapping.
4745967	4747069	Back to the FUs now, please.
4747109	4747369	Thank you.
4747890	4749873	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
4749893	4753477	Black Lab, our buddy, our pal, says, Fuck the Yankees.
4753538	4754359	They deserve to lose.
4755094	4757075	Fuck the Twins for beating the A's, dammit.
4757675	4761176	Fuck my allergies for knocking me out on Monday, I missed two classes because of it.
4761896	4767578	Fuck the University Dining Commons for closing their dinner times at 7pm and locking the doors five minutes before 7pm.
4768259	4775101	Fuck my bike for getting a flat tire as I left my last class on Friday, thus forcing me to walk it a half an hour across campus back to my dorm.
4775801	4780363	Fuck IRCLE and my IRC client for being so goddamn hard to crack, although it did get done.
4781423	4784144	Fuck the T1 line in the dorms for being so overcrowded.
4784164	4785724	250 or so people share it.
4786725	4789625	And so slow that I can't get more than 5k a second on downloads.
4790185	4792406	Fuck the local ride aid for closing at 8pm.
4792466	4794067	I couldn't get my bike parts when I needed them.
4794727	4798488	Fuck the UC Housing Commission for not letting me bring my car up because of parking issues.
4798548	4801749	I would have been at the show tonight to give you the rest of these FUs in person if I had my car.
4802669	4806210	And number 10... Fuck raving.
4813880	4815020	Black Lab, you brought that on yourself.
4815721	4821282	I didn't get number 10 from him, unfortunately, so I don't know what happened, but that was number 11, so I guess I missed one.
4821302	4822143	I'm sure he'll send it to me.
4824884	4826724	Twins got a few.
4826764	4828065	Let's see if I can run through these here.
4828085	4828105	F...
4830362	4837167	FU Arcade owner's daughter's boyfriend bitching at me because he thinks I broke the Percussion Freaks machine we just got on Friday.
4837487	4840389	He does say thank you for Percussion Freaks 4th and PPB 1st.
4840429	4841610	Hooray for Korean knockoffs.
4842591	4846974	FU to AOLIM for cutting me off every five minutes on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings.
4848175	4852018	FU to his attitude in the channel earlier this week.
4852882	4855065	FU to stuff.
4856366	4859769	FU to OthersideIRC.net for being down this weekend.
4860250	4861071	Yeah, F champs.
4861251	4862172	F Nick Servant champs.
4862192	4863253	They've been gone all weekend.
4863333	4863793	Fuck that.
4863873	4864294	I agree.
4865555	4869679	F waiting until the beta Fate of Fury comes out because that got delayed until the 15th, I think.
4870460	4872202	F waiting until Max USA comes out.
4872362	4873343	F waiting until FU is.
4873363	4873884	Well, jeez.
4875706	4878208	He's just full of fucking fucks tonight.
4878909	4879449	Fuck waiting.
4879589	4883052	Oh, did we get number 10?
4883653	4884373	Oh, fuck yeah.
4884834	4885594	Black Lab's number 10.
4885934	4889357	SoCalKicks says he's had a pretty crappy week.
4889417	4891179	He was supposed to not be here tonight.
4891219	4895502	He was going to go out and hang with some friends, but here he is in the chat room sending his FUs.
4895542	4903469	He says, fuck you, Jason, who didn't drive me to Boomers to see Mike, who I haven't seen in over a month, and who I really, really wanted to see, and fuck you, Sky, for threatening to cut me.
4904738	4908160	There's a long story there that I'm not going to tell on the air.
4908240	4910601	But I did threaten to cut SoCalKicks earlier.
4910821	4911361	I'm going to cut him.
4911381	4912082	He's going to cut you.
4914503	4915884	Anyways, do you have any more?
4916024	4916284	Yes.
4917925	4921887	JB says, Fuck you to anyone who hates Jenny Rom.
4921907	4923668	They can all suffer massive quantities of pain.
4925089	4930271	And fuck you to himself for almost failing freshman seminar with a D. Uh-oh.
4930291	4932933	You are my friend.
4934223	4937706	23rd Magus says, Shine Get, and FU to Shingle Springs.
4937766	4938807	They stole my girlfriend.
4938847	4939987	Two words, suicide watch.
4940107	4941809	Oh, that's kind of harsh.
4941909	4942669	We're sorry to hear that.
4942689	4943110	I'm sorry.
4946552	4951976	MoreThanJay says, FU to all the people who asked to use my health baby, egg baby, as a football.
4952116	4952856	They can't abuse it.
4952876	4953637	That's my job.
4954818	4958820	Dude, they should give them Tamagotchi as their egg baby.
4959181	4962103	Because that's, you know, you should use one of those.
4963677	4964298	Do we have any more?
4964538	4964798	Yes.
4965579	4969464	DJ Konami wants to give an F you to... That's what he says.
4969644	4970005	Okay.
4971507	4972328	He can't throw up.
4972468	4976933	And Joe Mama says F you to his computer for being shitty after Microsoft made me update.
4979318	4981860	That's why you never download the Microsoft update.
4981920	4985443	Ask Microsoft for getting into Liksang's business and shutting them down.
4985463	4986224	Yeah, fuck a bunch of them.
4986524	4987365	We need more angry music.
4987425	4988045	Fuck the Xbox.
4988145	4989266	We need more angry music.
4989306	4990187	We do not need love music.
4990467	4990887	I'm sorry.
4991328	4993830	Bigger console meets better console, correct?
4996772	4999354	You know, fuck Microsoft.
5000755	5002076	Fuck the, what, RIA?
5002517	5004799	Now Jamie's going to have to buy all her stuff from BuyRite.
5006176	5007257	Oh, hell no!
5008038	5011461	Jamie does not buy from Byright, because they are stupid fucks.
5011541	5022771	I'll have you know that I bought my original DDR Max, Japanese version, the one I eventually sold off later on, but I've originally bought them, bought that from Byright, and I had no problems whatsoever.
5022791	5025173	No, no, no, this is what Byright does.
5025193	5033580	But yeah, I know, we know about the whole Tekken thing, so... Fuck Byright, fuck them right in one of their pores, because none of their other orifices are good enough.
5035126	5036586	Okay, I want it painful.
5038967	5052631	But you know what, I do have to say, I did buy my copy of Dracula X, Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known in the United States as Symphony of the Night, but I bought the Saturn version there for $23 when it was brand new, and now it goes for over $100 on eBay.
5052651	5052631	$23?
5052671	5055332	I'll buy that for a dollar.
5055612	5059833	Alright, last chat room FUs, these are the last ones, this segment's going on way too long.
5059913	5064074	23rd Magus says, uh, Shine Lose.
5065453	5066574	We're sorry, Vegas.
5066614	5069616	Here's a big hug from Jamie and I. Big hug.
5070977	5074959	MoreThanJay says, Fuck Microshaft for putting down that Linux project.
5075099	5076380	Linux.
5076480	5076780	Linux.
5077100	5077400	My bad.
5077420	5079321	You know, I still like what my friend calls them.
5079862	5081603	I call them, you know, Microshaft.
5082323	5083704	My friend calls them Microflashers.
5087626	5090388	On that note, I think... Go to dictionary.com if you don't know what it means.
5091718	5093960	On that note, I do believe we're going to take another break.
5095341	5096202	What do I want to play this break?
5096242	5099244	This break, I want to play some Vincent Demore because I think he's awesome.
5099264	5107231	So I have a new version of Flotation from his Greatest Hits Disc 1 and a big muah, muah, muah, hugs and kisses to Tal for sending this to me.
5107691	5108171	He rules.
5108251	5109892	He sent me some Vincent Damore albums this week.
5110372	5111032	And I'm going to play this.
5111052	5112573	This is a new version of Floatation.
5112673	5113853	Well, actually, it's not really new.
5113893	5114593	It's just from his album.
5114653	5115094	It's new to me.
5115394	5116294	And it's new to Orange Lounge.
5116594	5118075	This is a Floatation radio mix.
5118595	5119855	And then we'll play something else.
5119915	5120776	Maybe something from 8-Style.
5120796	5121636	How about Love is Orange?
5121836	5122676	We'll play some Love is Orange.
5122896	5123717	We'll play Love is Orange.
5123817	5125077	And play that one song that I like.
5125297	5125997	And then we'll come back.
5126277	5126978	And what are we going to do?
5126998	5127618	Are we going to do Listless?
5128777	5129137	Why not?
5129157	5129978	We're going to do a list list.
5129998	5130919	We're going to do a list list tonight.
5131220	5132641	We'll come back with a list list.
5132681	5134283	We're not telling you the topic until we come back.
5134303	5139308	So it's going to be kind of a longer break, but that's okay because we're going to play some good shit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5140990	5142091	Orange Lounge Radio
5183578	5184380	Thanks for watching!
5255259	5256260	Thank you for watching!

5573883	5574845	Thank you for watching!
5602558	5603159	Thanks for watching!
5666328	5667032	Thanks for watching!
5745572	5748845	The sound of goodbye is louder
5817885	5822027	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
5822267	5823968	Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?
5824028	5824369	No!
5824489	5828151	Do we care what people think of us?
5828771	5830612	No!
5830632	5832073	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
5832533	5834814	Yes!
5836615	5841418	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
5843873	5844874	All right, we are back.
5844934	5848736	This is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 15.
5848776	5853319	We, as promised, are going to do a listless, one of our favorite segments on this show.
5853379	5853699	Why?
5854339	5855560	Because we get to make decisions.
5856760	5858802	And you just have to deal with our list.
5858842	5863324	We put it down and we say this is the best or worst ever.
5863684	5864405	Our word is law.
5864885	5865445	It is law.
5865545	5866606	Resistance is futile.
5868610	5873875	So, uh, but really the final, ultimate decision lies with you guys in the chat room.
5874395	5883764	So, get into our chat, yeah, don't fuck up, and get into our chat room right now at irc.eggheads.org, Channel Pound, Orange Lounge, and you can vote on our list.
5884004	5894814	Basically the way Listless works, we're gonna give a topic, and then I'm gonna give three songs in that topic, we're gonna give our top three, all the four guests here tonight, Jamie, and then Dave and Loki, we're all gonna give their top three answers.
5894834	5895054	Yes!
5895968	5899591	You're the host and the guest.
5899671	5902453	I'm sorry, did I put you on the... I meant the host, Jamie, and the guest.
5903213	5904875	You can't see my hand motions, that's why.
5904895	5914802	We're going to be revealing our top three, and then...
5916917	5917738	The chatroom votes.
5918058	5918258	No.
5918598	5920079	No, then there's the elimination round.
5920139	5920979	Our favorite part.
5921119	5922180	What makes this game the best?
5922220	5923141	We piss each other off.
5923581	5926683	We piss each other off by taking one off the list.
5927083	5929744	Then each one of us gets to take one off the list.
5930385	5933827	And then the finalized list, you guys vote on and we get a top three right from there.
5935214	5936555	What's the topic you ask?
5936695	5937935	Well, it's a topical topic.
5938215	5940196	What song do you best like to pick your nose to?
5940356	5945898	No, it is what... It's going along with what's being in the Bimani world right now.
5946058	5950940	What Konami original song that's not already in DDR do you want... Hold your horses.
5950960	5952341	We'll tell you the topic when we're damn ready to.
5952361	5953281	I'm telling them right now.
5954483	5959086	What Konami original that hasn't already been in DDR would you most like to see in Max 3?
5960026	5967291	What did you vote for on the site to determine what song should be in Max 3?
5967571	5968531	Konami original.
5970392	5970913	Yes, Dave.
5972694	5977078	Okay, so this is any... Are you starting this?
5977298	5978679	No, it's Konami original.
5978699	5979620	It has to be Konami original.
5979640	5981561	What does Konami original mean?
5981941	5983503	Did you already make a list without Konami?
5983543	5984043	I think.
5984123	5985965	I don't know what the difference is.
5986225	5987006	Oh my god.
5987626	5989147	We might have to take another break.
5989167	5989788	Okay, fine.
5990428	5990608	No.
5991528	5992489	Alright, fine, no breaks.
5992869	5999411	It's a song like any song in Beatmania that was by Konami, you know, Naoki or something, that hasn't already been in DDR.
5999451	6002792	I'm trying to think if they were by Konami or not.
6004393	6005193	We'll let you know.
6005673	6006394	Don't worry, Dave.
6006514	6007054	We'll let you know.
6007094	6008034	Why don't we start with Dave?
6008094	6009395	Dave, what is your number three?
6009755	6010195	Okay.
6010735	6013778	The number three choice is V. Good morning, Dave.
6014078	6014999	Is that qualified?
6015039	6016280	V, yes, V counts.
6016320	6017061	V is Taka.
6017542	6018082	That'll count.
6018923	6020364	And it's less work for Rob to type.
6020865	6022647	Yes, it's very little work for me to type.
6022907	6023587	Loki, next!
6025229	6032216	Alright, that was a very difficult decision, but I'm going to have to go with Instant Love.
6032496	6033217	Instant Love!
6033377	6033557	Oh yeah!
6033577	6034478	I didn't know that would show up.
6034958	6035559	Dude, cool.
6037372	6038432	No, it's not by Good Cool.
6038452	6040473	I believe it's by... No, I said Dude Cool.
6040493	6041713	I thought you said Good Cool.
6044814	6046174	Jamie, what's your number three choice?
6046294	6047054	Oh, any reason why?
6047114	6048214	We have to ask the reasons why.
6048755	6049495	Why Instant Love?
6049935	6054436	Because, you know, if they've got to put Let Them Move in there, at least make it a good remix of it.
6055116	6055516	Fair enough.
6056576	6057636	And Dave, your reason for V?
6058997	6059797	It's a good song.
6060441	6072045	You know, I actually have to vouch for V, because for anyone who's played Pump It Up, there basically is winter in Pump It Up, and it's freaking amazing, so I fully already know what it would be like.
6073065	6082989	So for my number three choice, I actually have to go with Release Your Mind, because, you know, I'm a tax whore.
6083929	6085410	Fair enough, Release Your Mind.
6087390	6088491	I'm typing with one hand.
6089317	6093765	Uh oh, better get that plastic cover ready Just because Tack owns, that's it?
6094386	6094907	That's your reason?
6095187	6100156	Because I'm secretly in love with Tack I guess it's not much of a secret anymore, is it?
6101403	6101423	V35
6129196	6133961	Because I fucking love that song, it's 8th style, and if you don't like it, you can suck my dick.
6134401	6136443	Alright, Dave, your number two choice.
6138265	6141148	Okay, my number two choice is Give Me a Sign.
6141748	6145092	Won't you give me some affection if you do, how much you like?
6145112	6146393	Yeah, because that song ruined it.
6146413	6147954	I promised I wouldn't sing tonight, I'm sorry.
6149276	6151378	And yeah, it would make a good song.
6152159	6153500	Rob's just our little songbird tonight.
6156573	6158498	Uh, Loki, your number two choice.
6158879	6164532	Dear Diary, today I heard someone like the song that I really didn't like.
6165288	6169549	So I'm going to go to America and, quote, suck his dick.
6170369	6177131	Anyways, now, my number two song would have to be, and you heard it during the break, VJ Army.
6177651	6178432	Ah, VJ Army.
6178452	6183333	Because there's already a DWI for it out there already, and it's an awesome song.
6183453	6188174	And it reminds me of Wild Rush because it's got a bunch of different styles of music in there, kind of all blend together.
6188314	6189195	Yeah, it's kind of fucked up.
6189235	6189555	I like it.
6190675	6191035	Thank you.
6191415	6192836	Jamie, your number two choice.
6193156	6194136	My number two choice.
6196557	6198858	It would have to be more tack.
6199258	6199918	Indigo Vision.
6200479	6201219	Indigo Vision.
6201239	6204900	Just because I want to do the freaking da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da steps, you know.
6205780	6206761	That would just be so cool.
6207421	6207881	Fair enough.
6208841	6209822	My number two choice.
6210582	6211923	And if you don't like this, I kill you.
6212543	6213803	You also heard this during the break.
6214503	6215184	Love is orange.
6216384	6217544	That would be so awesome to dance.
6217565	6218745	Better than love is dreaminess.
6221618	6223339	Hey now, watch out, that could be my number one.
6224039	6224459	You don't know.
6224479	6227680	I fucking love Love is Dreaminess.
6228741	6229741	Oh god, I hate that.
6231322	6233162	Okay, my number one.
6233202	6233603	Yes, dude.
6234043	6234703	Number one.
6234783	6236124	Konami original.
6236404	6237484	Drumroll, you hope.
6237504	6239225	I hope it qualifies for Konami.
6239325	6240305	We'll buzz you, don't worry.
6240585	6241746	Yeah, it's a wow wow 70s.
6242987	6244168	Wow Wow 70s.
6244188	6247050	Uh, yeah, Sampling Masters, I think they count.
6247371	6248652	Sampling Masters will count, I think.
6249152	6252375	Okay, now that would be cool just because the afros would be in the video.
6252395	6257439	Yeah, and it would, like, if you listen to it, it would make a really good song for the steps.
6258040	6259101	It would go along really well.
6259761	6260742	Wow Wow 70s to its own.
6261383	6261663	Loki!
6262881	6265723	Your number one Konami original ever, ever, ever, ever.
6265903	6266983	I just love this song.
6267184	6268784	I mean, ever since I heard it.
6270125	6270746	Outer Limits.
6271706	6273347	Outer Limits.
6278350	6283213	I was hoping when you said outer that you'd say outer wall, but... Jamie, your number one.
6283686	6284366	My number one.
6285686	6288267	It's a toss-up, but I'm going to have to go with Happy Hopper.
6288807	6289627	Happy Hopper.
6289847	6292228	It would just be insane to play.
6292848	6296288	And I'm requiring... Oops, I put Happer Hopper.
6297669	6300609	I'm requiring that you play that during the deliberation music, because I say so.
6301089	6301349	Okay.
6302469	6303310	My number one.
6303710	6304570	Black Lab, you're wrong.
6304610	6306950	I didn't put Summer Vacation, although that's not a bad idea.
6307050	6309231	My number one is Flotation.
6309471	6310531	Oh wait, I fucked up.
6312130	6312370	Original!
6312450	6312771	Original!
6312811	6313551	Stupid American!
6313571	6313931	Beep, beep, beep!
6313951	6313971	V!
6336673	6349862	Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Gimme A Sign, VJ Army, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, Wow Wow 70s, Outer Limits, Happy Hopper, and 321 Stars.
6349922	6353424	So now we get to do our favorite part, and that is the deletion round.
6353484	6355665	So, let's start with Dave.
6355725	6356646	Dave, what song...
6357575	6359476	is so sucky it needs to come off this list.
6360556	6366838	Um... I'm... Rob's gonna poop on me, but 3, 2, 1, start.
6366898	6367319	I hate you!
6367659	6368279	I hate you, die!
6369719	6370540	He gon' cut you!
6372864	6374666	I am going to cut you.
6374686	6375707	God, I'm going to cut so many people.
6375787	6377789	I'm just going to stick you.
6377809	6379591	That song rules.
6379992	6380793	One, two.
6381293	6382575	One, two, three, four.
6383115	6385138	Play Breakdown if you want to hear one, two, three, four.
6385178	6387941	We're just going to need to buy Rob a rototiller so he can run over everybody.
6388181	6388862	I hate you all.
6388942	6389543	Get out of my house.
6389663	6392086	Actually, if you want to hear one, two, three, four, you play Crash.
6394159	6394599	Anyways.
6395260	6396001	I'll get you.
6397061	6402086	I'm going to have to say, give me a sign, because R&B is so fourth mix.
6403467	6406830	So, down with this R&B stuff.
6406850	6407510	Give me a sign.
6407530	6409071	Unless it's got lesbians in the video.
6409091	6409632	It's gone.
6410959	6412600	Yes, I should have picked Summer Vacation.
6412680	6413100	Oh well.
6413180	6413500	Wah.
6413880	6418102	I hate to say it because the list is getting really hard for me to choose what to take off.
6418322	6420903	And as much as I like the song, I'd have to say take off VJ Army.
6422684	6423864	Shock, VJ Army.
6423904	6425985	I'm actually really pissed off at that song right now anyway.
6427826	6428506	What's left?
6428586	6431547	We've got all these pretty good, decent songs left.
6435809	6436369	I don't know.
6436589	6437390	This is too hard.
6437530	6438330	I can't decide.
6439671	6440551	I'm going to take off...
6443214	6446837	I'm going to be a complete asshole.
6447017	6452201	I'm sorry, I don't see this song in DDR, no matter what you say, no matter what you compare it to.
6453041	6454682	I just don't see this song in DDR.
6455323	6459506	I'm taking off V. You know, it works.
6460406	6462328	It's freaking evil in Pump It Up, though.
6463048	6465370	I like the rest of the songs there.
6465470	6469393	V is a 2DX song, it's a Keyboard Mania song, it's not a DDR song for me, so...
6470523	6471564	Wait till you see it in motion.
6471584	6472525	That's all I have to say.
6472545	6473986	You need to see someone play that on Pump It Up.
6474266	6474566	Nah, nah.
6474846	6476328	You need to see someone play it on Pump It Up.
6476548	6476748	Nah, nah.
6478322	6479123	Fuck you.
6479183	6479883	Fuck you.
6479943	6480283	Fuck you.
6507588	6509168	We'll be like, ha ha!
6509989	6511249	So here's the full list.
6511289	6514970	I'm posting it to the chat room right now, and then you can send me your votes.
6515030	6519531	Except I'm having to clear out the messages I've already gotten here.
6519571	6520491	I've got to clear these out.
6522631	6523852	Okay, here we go.
6524052	6524932	Here's your choices.
6524972	6525872	You want to read that off, Jamie?
6526232	6529113	Of course, as soon as you pull the thing up and start it.
6529953	6540378	We have Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Indigo Vision, Love is Orange, Wow Wow 70s Afro, Outer Limits, and Happy Hopper.
6540518	6543179	And on a personal note, I'd just like to say that everything that I picked is still there.
6543779	6544339	You know what though?
6544479	6544980	You know what though?
6545140	6548401	Honestly, Jim, now that I'm looking at the list again, I probably should have taken off Release Your Mind, I think.
6548481	6549122	Now that I'm looking at it.
6549682	6550622	But, oh well.
6550642	6551042	Too late.
6551102	6551903	What's done is done.
6552763	6556304	I did V. So send me your votes over private message.
6556844	6562506	And you've only got a minute and a half to do it because we've got to hurry up and end this show because I've got to get out of town.
6562966	6566007	So we're going to play Happy Hopper because Jamie said so.
6566627	6567227	And we'll be right back.
6567247	6568147	So you've only got a minute and a half.
6568167	6569208	Send those votes now, now, now, now, now.
6695810	6696713	Thank you for watching!
6775405	6781070	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?
6781351	6788497	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
6788817	6790799	It's unearthly.
6791039	6794743	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
6795871	6797854	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6797894	6800617	We're back to wrap up this little train wreck we've got going.
6801038	6804963	And we're going to do that by revealing the top three winners.
6805043	6808728	And we had a pretty good tie going there for a while, but we did resolve it.
6809068	6809649	It did resolve.
6809669	6811211	We have four songs all tied to one point.
6812125	6812345	Yes.
6813285	6817786	But we had somebody change their vote, which really kind of just did it right there.
6817826	6819887	It kind of broke all the ties we had.
6820307	6821867	And now we have the final list.
6821967	6826808	This is the Konami original we most want to see in Max 3 through the voting.
6828408	6830509	WowWow70s is in third place.
6830749	6831529	Yay.
6832129	6832409	Afro.
6832429	6832609	Afro.
6832969	6833269	Afro.
6833949	6836490	In second place, Outer Limits.
6837450	6838350	Yay.
6841812	6842972	Oh, I sense a personal grudge.
6844473	6845753	You're just pissed because I took V off.
6847093	6847393	Bitch.
6848094	6852095	In first place, this is the only drumroll I have, so deal with it.
6853795	6855655	Happy Hopper wins!
6855735	6857236	Because I rule and I have good taste.
6858396	6865718	Happy Hopper is the... And you know, we're actually somewhat unsure if that's a Konami original, aren't we?
6865778	6866158	We're kind of...
6867065	6874665	We're just going to say it is I would like to play Tetris while playing Happy Hopper It wins, so Happy Hopper wins Because we said so
6876078	6876558	We said so.
6876918	6880059	So we're going to have to kind of wrap up the show here.
6880119	6882300	We're coming into the last home stretch here.
6882580	6885801	Just want to remind everybody that Sunday's show will be pre-taped.
6886541	6887562	Come on into the chat room.
6887602	6890983	Our regulars will be there and talking about the pre-taped show as it's going on.
6891023	6894604	If you live in the Sacramento or Bay Area, join us at Sacramento Scandia.
6894644	6895925	I believe that's going to be Thursday night.
6895945	6900466	But please, please check the forums on sakbamani.com for any changes.
6900906	6902167	Chat room, praise y'all?
6902307	6903087	No, praise me.
6905829	6907531	and Instant Love came in fourth.
6907771	6910373	Instant Love was the one that was also tied in there, by the way.
6910413	6912215	Somebody changed their vote from Instant Love to something else.
6912235	6913336	It was winning for a while.
6913356	6916639	Yeah, it was winning for a while and then a bunch of people changed their votes.
6916719	6917620	So, whatever.
6917660	6918201	You guys are interesting.
6918221	6919161	Sorry, DJ Konami.
6919181	6919522	Sorry.
6919542	6920182	We still love you.
6920443	6923065	DJ Konami was the only one that ended up voting for Instant Love.
6923105	6924046	Everyone else changed their votes.
6925369	6927050	Yes, the dance floor is waiting for you.
6927290	6928071	Another reminder.
6928391	6929773	I'd like to also apologize.
6930173	6931955	Thursday's rebroadcast didn't happen.
6931995	6937099	That was my fault because work got in the way and I wasn't able to queue up the replay in time.
6937119	6939922	So I apologize to those of you that were listening Thursday for the rebroadcast.
6939962	6943445	But we will do this Thursday's rebroadcast at 2 p.m.
6943805	6947388	along with our Monday broadcast at 7 p.m., our rebroadcast.
6948649	6954252	and Saturday there will be no Orange Lounge at all because Live 365 will be down.
6954752	6957913	So every Live 365 station will be off air that night.
6957933	6960094	They're moving to an underground bunker server.
6960234	6966897	Yes, they're moving to an underground bunker so that Britney Spears and all those people doing the commercials, Stevie Wonder and all them can't get to them.
6967017	6969118	Stevie Wonder can't find us.
6969258	6970838	Dude, Britney Spears is rabid.
6970859	6971659	She'll bite one of them.
6972836	6973676	and give him herpes.
6974216	6975757	Or herpes.
6977297	6978457	Also known as cold sores.
6978537	6979557	No, I don't think so.
6980177	6981778	She's going to give him little icky crawly things.
6983418	6984918	Oops, I did it again.
6984978	6985518	What can I say?
6988039	6988679	Gosh, what else?
6988699	6991439	Remember, you can get an STD by playing DDR Max.
6995240	6998080	We got to get this thing wrapped up, so some final thoughts.
6998240	7000641	Jamie, you got any final... Oh, I'm sorry, you have an ooh.
7000741	7001321	You have an ooh, Matt?
7001829	7005911	Were we going to play the stupid song?
7006411	7008352	We're going to have to bump that to next week.
7008532	7013254	Because we were talking too long about... I don't know, what were we talking too long about?
7013354	7025619	Dear Diary, I made the stupid American show last too long because my segment was just as... Yeah, we bitched about DDR Max USA for too long and all that controversy going on there.
7025719	7027340	And don't forget about Conjoined Twin Galaxies.
7028913	7041780	Uh, yeah, and while we're queuing up the end of the show here, um, some update, nothing really going on, there are the DDR, um, or the Dancing Stage Remix 2 DWIs out there, so look for them, find them, they're pretty fun to play, really easy.
7042560	7046943	Um, other than that, DDR spots still down, still waiting for them to come up, I don't know why.
7047763	7049784	I should have asked, you know, Mike Noah's in town.
7049824	7052525	I should have asked him because he was right there, but I didn't even think to ask.
7052545	7053205	I missed that site.
7053225	7053625	My bad.
7053705	7054586	So that's down.
7055006	7059408	Really the only other news that we have to wait for is what new song is going to be announced on Wednesday.
7059988	7060568	That's about it.
7061468	7061889	Pretty easy.
7062729	7063049	Okay.
7064209	7065190	Any final thoughts from you, Dave?
7068371	7069571	Kachaka owns.
7070372	7072573	And my word of the week is philosophical.
7073413	7076014	Because if you were at the party last night, you know what I mean.
7077977	7082120	and also like to announce that I'll be doing news on Team Guilo now that they're back up.
7082200	7082921	Yay!
7082961	7085383	Does that make you a member of Team Guilo or does that mean you're doing news?
7085403	7086604	I never understood how their team was.
7086624	7089506	They said they were going to give me stickers and bribe me with stickers and stuff.
7089626	7090246	Well, that's cool.
7090507	7090927	I don't know.
7091047	7093489	You've got to work in some plugs for Orange Lounge.
7093509	7094390	Hey, I've been doing that.
7094430	7095430	Okay, good boy.
7095971	7096952	Alright, we like them.
7097112	7097872	We like getting plugs.
7098393	7100995	And my final thought of the week, rave!
7101015	7101095	Rave!
7104904	7106626	Oh, yeah, this is so good.
7106646	7107166	Oh, man.
7107186	7109368	Oh, I'm so fucked up right now.
7109708	7112331	Oh, the room is spinning.
7112691	7114372	Give me a hug.
7114512	7116274	I love you guys.
7116294	7118156	I love you guys.
7118236	7120217	Oh, that guy.
7120558	7121679	I was petting.
7121999	7124701	We were just rubbing and petting.
7124721	7125022	Go hug him.
7131860	7137805	If you like guns, if you like shooting, if you like action, and if you're going to rent the movies, rent them at Tam's Video on Irving and 22nd.
7161658	7163379	What is your membership number?
7170401	7170901	I don't know.
7172662	7174482	I don't know is your membership number?
7179784	7185166	Because I don't believe you've really had the San Francisco experience until you've been abused by a Chinese person.
7190086	7193611	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
