1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a video tape! Put it in, put it in!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now. Boring!

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This video stops!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
See, they've been so nasty.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult partners.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The galaxy is at peace.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He's good.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Mished it by that much.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's Dr. Evils cat.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How can you tell?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll never forget a pussy.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cat.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thirty-seven.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In a row?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Shh! And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are the weakest link goodbye.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Till you get nothing!

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You lose!

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good day sir!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Dear Diary,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My teen angst bullshit has a body count.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Dark Sakura.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Skye.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do I look like the weather girl?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everything alright?

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are live and this is episode number 17 for...

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You okay there?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You need some Nyquil there.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Capital N, small i, big fucking Q.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is episode number 17 for October the 27th of 2002.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You need some Robitussin. Robitussin! Robitussin!

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I almost said that on the pre-show list, except I don't have an editor to cut out all the talk to get me in.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most shy-and-get radio station of all things Bimani.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My name is Rob Roberts, be you might know me as Sky.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know her better, it starts out...

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you talking like, out of her box?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Jamie is recovering from ikitas.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We have a whole studio filled with guests, let's say hello to our guests!

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Actually, they're not even really guests anymore, they're just, they're always here.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're the back legs of the show, literally.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They're our mascot, they're our dancing girls.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because they sit behind us, so the back legs of the show.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Say hello to Loki!

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm the uncredited member of this show.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're the guy behind the curtain.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do not stare behind the curtain.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Nothing to see here, move along.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And also Dave, say hello to Dave.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm just a guy.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm just a guy.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You know that No Doubt song, I'm just a girl?

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But you can just, I'm just a, you know.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe he really is just a girl.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
it's one of those evenings

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,860
we'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later but first gonna take a

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,120

with some songs that we want to play for you

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,380
we have to take the children out for a walk

76
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,920
any other opening thoughts from you Jamie?

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm mad at you

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,900

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,800
you could sing i was you could take a dive

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I will just take my saxophone tape and beat around with it.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,040
thing because Jamie's got a lot she was to say and I'm very very scared what

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:09,040
else can I say? I can only hope. We'll see you in a little bit. Later.

93
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:30,480
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song orange lounge radio you

94
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,340
you are listening to or in times radio

95
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,840
episode number seventeen health and then we are just a catch-up was when i told

96
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,340
you about the new program

97
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
as well today to dance

98
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,880
you know that

99
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,640
it's the new macarena

100
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
in

101
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,320
you leave for a week and it's just everything is going to help the hell

102
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,760
but

103
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,920
and you know on top of that i'm missing make a boy action okay

104
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I missed YowieCon, and I was there.

105
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Okay, tell us all about what you were leaving for...

106
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,920
What the hell? Somebody's sending their alarm right outside my window. Anyway...

107
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Tell everybody about why you left last weekend, what the plan was that you were going to be gone for, and what ended up making you late, and all that.

108
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I was going to go to YowieCon, because I wanted to go buy doujinshi. Because, dammit, I'm a nerd.

109
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,920
So, Julie says, okay, well we're going to leave in the morning, after my class. So will they cancel her class?

110
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,920
It doesn't matter though because Julie still didn't get to my house until six in the evening.

111
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Describe yaoi for everybody who may not know.

112
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You know what, I'd have to get the exact terminology because the word yaoi is actually combinations of parts of three different words.

113
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,920
And right now I'm too brain dead to actually remember what they mean.

114
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
But it's basically...

115
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Gay porn.

116
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
No, it's not.

117
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
It has also to do with, you know, the...

118
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Man love.

119
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,920
You know there's actually a street in Sacramento called Man Love?

120
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Yeah, I drove by there and I was like, well, that's pretty cool.

121
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Okay.

122
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
I think Dark Tetsuya lives by Man Love.

123
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying.

124
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Anyway, I was going to go to YowieCon so I could, you know, look at all the pretty art

125
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,920
and watch the pretty anime and see the pretty boys and, you know, see cosplayers and stuff.

126
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,920
and stuff. So we get there and we decide that it's late so we go to Pacific East Mall. It's

127
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,320
not in Berkeley but near Berkeley. Wait, do cosplayers for Yowie dress up as naked men

128
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:41,420
or something? No! God. Anyway, so I go and I have this chat with this really nice guy

129
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:49,880
there about the Trueno because I want one. For people who have no knowledge of Toyotas

130
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,360
or Initial D, basically it was the Corolla in Japan, and I want one. I actually liked

131
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,040
the car before I ever heard of the Automate. But anyway, we ended up just hanging out,

132
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,720
we went to go, oh, your horn works, you whore!

133
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,160
For those, if it's us not picking up over our microphone, somebody's honking the horn

134
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,160
quite obnoxiously outside. Oh, Jamie's gonna go do something about it!

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,960
God, I hope the mic picked that up. Jamie just went over to the window and went,

136
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,600
SHH! We're trying to do a show!

137
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
Anyway,

138
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
we go hang out at Krista's house. Actually, we went to San Francisco and picked up Krista,

139
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,280
who was working the convention with a Japanese guest.

140
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
What?

141
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:48,600
The people outside are screaming, this is, okay.

142
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
We just heard the N-word.

143
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Away from the bad radio.

144
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:02,360
Anyway, we drove all over San Francisco, we ate at Mizune in the Kintetsu Mall, went back,

145
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,680
crashed out, got up the next day with the full intention of spending the $30 to get

146
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,760
into the convention so we could go shopping in the dealer's room, and oh, don't forget,

147
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
pay $15 to park.

148
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
I hate that.

149
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,520
Frisco can go to hell and die for costing so much to park in.

150
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,040
Well, we went all over the place, and Julie and I sat back and we went, you know what,

151
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
fuck that.

152
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,480
We decided not to go to YowieCon.

153
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,320
So we went all over the place and spent a bunch of money instead, and then we walked

154
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
Krista's dog in Berkeley.

155
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,880
We get back, we decided that we were going to go to Network Video because we thought

156
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
we had time.

157
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
We didn't realize that we got back at five.

158
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,040
video being the local import video game store? Local meaning Bay Area.

159
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,620
We had an hour to get there, so we get in the car, and we're on our way to network video.

160
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,000
We get stuck in evil traffic going into San Francisco. It took us an hour just to get

161
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,660
past the toll booth from Berkeley to there. I call Rob at, oh what, six something? Rob,

162
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,660
guess what, we're in traffic at the toll booth, going into San Francisco. So finally, you

163
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,160
You know that really weird phone call where you know, I couldn't hear anything that was me calling from Mifune again over my oyako donburi

164
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,320
Which was really yummy, by the way, and it got back like evil late and that was it because after

165
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
We went shopping before we ate

166
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,980
So if you could sum up the weekend in one word, that would be

167
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,160
I ran into people in the hallway outside of

168
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
the

169
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,300
you could be a enjoying a nap there loki

My Fuck You of the Week goes toward JJ North's Cheesecake today.

183
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,580
It's like a hometown buffet.

184
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,060
It sounds like a clothing store.

185
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,180
For people that are back east, it's also like the Piccadilly, basically.

186
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,420
Well, not necessarily like Piccadilly, because that's more of a cafeteria-type place.

187
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
It's basically a big buffet.

188
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,420
You know, just all kinds of crappy food that's been sitting out for five hours.

189
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,420
I hadn't eaten at JJ North's in forever, and Waffle Square, OK, damn them, they were busy.

190
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
That should be Chicken and Waffle Square.

191
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Full of old people.

192
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:46,420
So, we decided to go to JJ North's because I was actually feeling good today, because I went home early Friday because I was sick, as you can't tell from my...

193
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Anyway, that was gross.

194
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,420
So I go, and I'm all happy because the food sucked and I want a cheesecake.

195
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,420
I eat a cheesecake and it tastes like the meringue topping from a lemon meringue pie. It was really gross.

196
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
And so, that sucked.

197
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,420
The second fuck you of the week goes to Rob.

198
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Hey!

199
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,420

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
You bitch.

201
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:15,420
For those that don't know, our chat room, Channel Pound Orange Lounge on any other side, IRC server, was crowded as fucking hell on Friday.

202
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
It was almost like having a show, it was very random.

203
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,420
So they got in there and said, Sky, go live, play some requests.

204
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
So I did.

205
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,420
And we went on there and played some, uh, we were playing a bunch of dirty songs in a row.

206
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,160
We played like I can yell put it in my mouth and we play I think we played how many licks

207

209
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,160

228
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,620
of your time. Seriously, it doesn't have any redeeming parts of it at all. It's just crap.

229
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,500
Crap Disguise is like a good action movie. And also, uh, uh, actually another F you to

231
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,400

232
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,080
cake, so it's okay. It was, hey, this is Fast and the Fierce as a spy. That's what it was.

Ooh, who would've thought that? What are the odds of that happening? Sorry, could you repeat that for our audience?

237
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Uh, yes I'm finished.

my fuck you the week

258
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,580
is the fact that drinking inhibits one's abilities to drive.

259
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,840
No, I didn't do anything stupid.

260
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,460
But last night I went out to the local bar, the local number one bar,

261
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,920
and I was the designated driver.

262
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,800
And my two friends I was with were the designated drunks.

263
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,420
When I'm drunk I have a lot more fun, but no, I have to drive, so I can't do any drinking.

264
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,520
i didn't stop me from having a uh... pebble shot we first got there which by

265
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,000
the way is uh... red bull mixed with malibu very good stress and i'm

266
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,300
but of course is out there for four hours was the color of death

267
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,800
and it smells like pussy what's your point

268
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,620
okay

269
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,860
so uh...

270
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,300
it took uh... it we were there for four hours so i was ready to agree that

271
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,900
template and get out of the system of a two friends

272
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
when they get very drunk they're bold as hell is just you know i have a lot of

273
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,960
fun a lot a lot of fun and uh... i uh...

274
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,960
I had fun, but I was just kind of just sitting there, kind of, yeah, I'm the driver.

275
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Wee.

276
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
But my costume owned.

277
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I don't know if you guys saw my costume, did you see my costume on my journal?

278
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I saw that, that was pretty cool, it was a milk box with the missing and then it went

279
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
on your head.

280
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Yeah, so it was a big hat, it was a big milk cart and it says missing and it has my head

281
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
in it.

282
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,280
And I'm sure somebody will post a picture in the chat room, somebody will post a link

283
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,960
to the picture of my Halloween costume.

284
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,480
I just had 24 traffic covers fresh on me.

285
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
So my FU is towards DUIs.

286
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Do people need to come and help me make my costume?

287
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Cause I've been lazy. I've had the stuff to make my costume now.

288
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
For what? A month?

289
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I haven't made it. So fuck my costume.

290
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Let's get to the chatroom FUs.

291
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,480
JB says, FU to nobody buying me the new Jenny Rom single, Ika Uka.

292
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Actually, I don't know if that's new. I just said it was.

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:14,480
f you to his math book for having a Spanish glossary or whatever. It made him mad because I couldn't find the English one.

294
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:26,480
SoCalKick says, Fuck you Weekend for being boring as fuck and Funk you Sky for superliminally making me expose myself.

295
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,480
He exposed himself in the chatroom.

296
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,480
He pulled down his pants and made us cry.

297
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Twen says, FU did his arcade for having to send the DDR boards and kit to some guy to get it upgraded to Max 2.

298
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
FU to never being able to get on early enough because of his damn mother.

299
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,480
FU to GJ Bad Sight for going completely down for the past two days.

300
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,480
He has a super secret message for Loki, and then F you to people who watch baseball.

301
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Actually, DJ Bad's site isn't down.

302
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Just the download section is.

303
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
He has his Geocities site still up, though.

304
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,480
And I don't watch baseball. My parents do, and they're all like,

305
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Yeah, it's 4 to 1 Angels, or whatever. Actually, they like the guys.

306
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Anyway, that's not the point. The point is I don't watch it.

307
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
But Loki seems to like it.

308
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Can I continue?

309
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Fuck! I just typed, yay, this porno is almost done downloading to this chick I like.

310
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Fucking wrong instant message windows. Ugh, I've so ruined my chances with her.

311
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,480
That's why you say, ha ha ha ha, that was funny.

312
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
That's a ha ha joke.

313
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Want to come over and watch?

314
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,480
That's like that cable, or what was it, that beer commercial or something like that where the woman comes over.

315
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Hey, is this the adult channel?

316
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Well, I guess it is.

317
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
And then they advertise the beer or something like that.

318
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Why is that a bad thing?

319
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Because we have to choose.

320
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,880
That's true. You have to choose.

321
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,380
Okay.

322
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,880
I want the boy kind.

323
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,680
Dude, that'd be cool.

324
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
Dude, I don't...

325
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,280
Transforming.

326
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,880
Hello Kitty.

327
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Dude, you win.

328
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,980
Dude, anyway.

329
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
And BlackLap says,

330
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,580
F you, number one, to fuck this 1600 award paper that is due tomorrow that he hasn't started on yet.

331
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,180
Whoops.

332
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,080
Fuck his roommate for missing his train at 8 a.m. Saturday,

333
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,080
thus ruining his chances for a peaceful weekend to myself.

334
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,080
Fuck his roommate again for bringing home some girl last night and making out until all

335
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,940
hours of the morning while I was still in the room.

336
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,100
Yeah, you don't do that shit with your roommate in there.

337
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,300
And you don't do that shit with your roommate.

338
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,900
I lived in a dorm room, hello.

339
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,100
You do not have people over making out in the dorm room when your roommate is there.

340
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:53,100
you pay your roommates to go play at the arcade unless he's really hot and swings that way

341
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,120
you still go somewhere else to make out

342
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,320
it's courteous

343
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,220
i don't want to listen to two people

344
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,220
sucking on each other unless i'm allowed to participate

345
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,740
you know you feel left out

346
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,740
scorecard

347
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,600
blacklads fus are always fun

348
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,640
and uh... fuck shitty Verizon brand phones for sucking ass and shitting off

349
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,120

350
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
he left out a vowel so I put in my own

351
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,480
and shitting off at random times and not hold

352
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,900

353
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,140
his rise of phone come on

354
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,660

367
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,700
nintendo has gone and done it again

368
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,500
i am once again addicted to one of their products

369
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,340
let's hear it for animal crossing

370
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,060
i have been coming home

371
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,200
worrying about my virtual mortgage and how the hell i'm going to pay it off

372
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,740
with fish and bugs

373
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,540
Tom Nook is an asshole, and I want Mallory to move out of my village.

374
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,180
The fucking duck bitch needs to move, and I hate that bitch Phyllis at night in the post office.

375
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,460
Oh my god, she just needs to-

376
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,740
They need to gut her.

377
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,900
Just do her over an open fire.

378
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,300
You're talking about a video game, might I remind you? Yes, I am.

379
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,740
And dammit,

380
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,940
Lobo is cool, because he's a big wolf, and he's up until three in the morning.

381
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,780
But, fuck you Nintendo, and thank you.

382
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,380
I love Animal Crossing, and I hate you bitches.

383
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
But I need to play more Kingdom Hearts 2.

384
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,780
Where have you been?

385
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:42,060
Rob, yeah, fuck you, because you gave away your TVX controller for a night, so I couldn't

386
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,060
play it.

387
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
I honest probably-

388
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,740
I always go in like 45 minutes into the show and play for about half an hour or 45 minutes.

389
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,660
Yeah, like I have like $250, $300, I don't know.

390
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,580
Dude, the controllers, you get them from 89 now.

391
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,140
My next fuck you is, my fuck you goes to money, because I don't have enough money.

392
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,820
I need more money because I can't afford a GameCube and I can't get Animal Crossing.

393
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,260
And Jamie tells me how much fun it is and I get to see how she has all her cute little

394
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,340
shirts and stuff and I can't play because I'm poor.

395
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:18,260
He gets to listen to me yell at Mallory because she's a stupid bitch and yell at all the people.

396
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:26,260
And then I did design the coolest outfit and it was inspired by my gothic and lolita bible.

397
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:34,260
But anyway, um, I just had a silent moment. Thank you, Rob.

398
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
You're welcome.

399
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Rob totally broke my concentration. Blame him for the train wreck. Fuck you, Rob.

400
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,260
So when are you going to do your random shows?

401
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
Okay, I'll buy you more orange balls.

402
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Oh yes, thank you, Jamie, for buying me big orange balls. I appreciate that.

403
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Big fluffy orange balls.

404
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,260
I have some big fluffy squishy orange balls and I put them in my mouth before the show.

405
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:00,420
Yes, he did but I didn't watch because I had cupcakes and I had snowballs so you perverts can you know

406
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Why do they call them snowball?

407
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Did you spit them into your girlfriend's mouth

408
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,180
Yay random

409
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,220
Go watch clerks all of you right now you poor deprived people

410
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,260
I see my buddy Travis joining the chat room, so I want to say hello.

411
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,460
I'm glad you're listening.

412
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
That's so cool.

413
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,020
I hope everything's going good for you in Texas.

414
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
This is for you.

415
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:40,860
The stars at night shine big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.

416
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,940
That's the second Pee Wee reference I made tonight.

417
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,860
That's pretty scary.

418
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,020
When I yelled at the people across the street.

419
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:55,060
Yes, the people across the street, by the way, have been quiet, because the thing is,

420
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,020
I would have been inspired again by Animal Crossing, by taking my axe and treating them

421
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,820
like a tree, and cutting them down.

422
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Are you saying that you would have chopped up their booty?

423
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,100
Yes, the word of the night is booty.

424
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Anything associated with the booty, we say the ass, we say my baby mama.

425
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:24,500
i could ask you what the word of the day is again okay

426
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,980
anyway that is the word of the evening is

427
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,420
although the raving was pretty fun

428
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,740
tell us what was that remix we heard right before the show started that uh...

429
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,660
mix of

430
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:55,380
I went home after the rave show and decided, you know what, I don't have this song on my

431
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,420
computer and I kind of want it.

432
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,620
So I went on Kazalite, yay, because it's the only thing that will work with my firewall,

433
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:09,420
and I went downloading one that was called Children of the Sandstorm, and it was a mix

434
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,340
of children and sandstorm, as the name implies.

435
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,060
cool but it's very well done it's very nice yes I actually like it better than

436
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,520
the other versions of the song so speaking of sandstorm DDR max USA coming

437
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,960
out this week it's tentatively Tuesday from what I am telling game stops are

438
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,000
getting there we're hearing Monday Tuesday we're hearing all sorts of days

439
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,960
basically an open demo in my purse and I mean shipping it out this week and

440
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,040
whenever the stores get it they get it and then your grubby little hands can go

441
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,160
buy it you know we could do during one of the later breaks what I put in my

442
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,080
you know it's it's that's it's the demo you guys the same demo but it's safe to

443
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,260
act right see it huh have you played that I haven't I haven't seen I played

444
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,740
that I have the PlayStation magazine demo yeah I saw the demo to see you got

445
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,220
it's pretty cool we can go out and hook it up we'll do that during one of the

446
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,620
breaks huh basically well it's the newer version of the demo because I guess what

447
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,260
happened is that the original PlayStation magazine demo was actually

448
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,500
an older version of the demo and the arrows were all miss synced on two of

449
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,780
The songs, isn't that nice?

450
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,820
I was led to believe that that one actually has a little bit more on it since it's just

451
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
a demo disc.

452
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
No, we can go plug it in.

453
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
Just DDR Max.

454
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,260
We can go plug it in and see what happens.

455
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:30,260
But lots of stuff on DDR Max USA, they just revealed this week, Electronic Gaming Monthly

456
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:36,300
spilled the beans in their review that there is in fact an Oni mode in DDR Max USA.

457
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,620
I think this is a really weird thing to have in a home version because most people haven't

458
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,780
spent a hundred bucks on a ignition pad and most people don't have metal pads

459
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,260
most people are playing with those ghetto little pads either you know the

460
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,820
the what do they call them the beat stage pads or what are those things

461
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,740
called the ghetto ones you can buy at Fry's what are those called the ass pad

462
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,820
I don't know the ass pad you can buy these ass pads that's what most people

463
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:11,820
play with

464
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,460
uh... internet access

465
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,860
uh...

466
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,020
if the market show them to get that done

467
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,480
did their both only surprise

468
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,480
people by these booty s pads of fries

469
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,840
Anyway, you play Oni mode on these really crappy pads, you're going to be halfway across

470
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,780
the room by the time you finish, and there's no way you're going to be able to keep, you're

471
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,560
not even going to be able to pass that, like, dumbed down for Americans Oni, the lesson

472
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,140
Oni or whatever it's called, you're not even going to be able to pass that on most normal

473
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
home pads.

474
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
So it seems very odd to me.

475
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I thought they'd do non-stops.

476
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,520
I thought we'd have non-stops, but I didn't think we'd have Oni.

477
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
I have to admit I'm surprised.

478
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,080
Well this is what we have on the back of the demo, though, for the DDR Max.

479
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Okay!

480
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,380
From one of the images that has screen capture of the select list, we have Healing Vision

481
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,780
Insertion Let the Beat Hit Em, Look to the Sky, Love Again Tonight, Midnight Blaze, Paranoia

482
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,300
Evolution, Orion 78, this is over 70 songs.

483
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes, over 70 songs.

484
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,260
From what I understand, both are in there.

485
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,940
But that's just what's on the back of here, for all the people who were, well I'm actually

486
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,820
reading a screen capture off the back of this.

487
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,660
So those are just a few of the ones that I'm assuming this is taken from the working version.

488
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Let me see.

489
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,980
I'm just reading this, let's see.

490
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,520
Revolutionary to the Max.

491
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,060
The evolution of the revolution is here with DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution.

492
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,940
Get ready to experience maximum dancing with all new songs and game modes, high energy

493
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,040
pulsating music, and stunning graphics.

494
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,980
The ultimate dancing game is now revolutionary to the max.

495
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,580
Dear Diary, that guy who wanted to be just like his sick was reading the back of the

496
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,900
American version of Dance Stats Revolution.

497
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,500
Just listening to his voice makes me all excited in special places.

498
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,460
Love, Mauki.

499
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,860
Yeah I'm reading that little mini song list they have on the back.

500
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,100
This pretty much spoils half the list there.

501
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,620
There's the Orion 7-8 Civ mix.

502
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,180
So this just kind of confirms some more songs for you.

503
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,940
Actually I think I've seen that screenshot before about a couple weeks ago.

504
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,140
But we can also check that out during one of the breaks and see what's available on the demo.

505
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,740
One thing, though, that I did note is that the demo disc is one of the blue CDs, which means it's not DVD.

506
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,900
If the last release of Max is any indication, the one that came out for PS2 in Japan, it's also on a CD.

507
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,180
So I'm sort of thinking that the new one's not going to be on a DVD.

508
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,780
So we may be seeing video sacrifices.

509
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,620
I'm not sure.

510
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,860
Rob, I think it's going to be on DVD.

511
00:38:52,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Rob, I think that you should do the intro and be the announcer for the DDR Max, because you read a lot better than the announcer right now.

512
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Hey, Konami, if you're out there listening, I want to be the new announcer, so send me a letter or something. Shoot me an email.

513
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,860
They should just get the guy from Ridge Racer to do it, because he sounds like the original announcer anyway.

514
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Send us an email, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

515
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,860
I've got everything on camera so you can watch it again. You're the greatest.

516
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:21,860
SoCalKicks is stamping his foot and insisting the DDR Max USA is on a DVD. It's confirmed, whatever that means.

517
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,380
whatever that means they need to get uh... bobcat uh...

518
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,460
bobcat goldthwaite yes

519
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,980
the best ddr announcer

520
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,220
and i think you fucked up

521
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,660
is that

522
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,960
you mean it

523
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,420
uh... and the fact that

524
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,760
who else is a good topic who else would be a good ddr announcer

525
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,100
still can't be

526
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,740
you can't

527
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,640
lady at it have a quick pop

528
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,020
without the email and answers

529
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,620
charo

530
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,580
kitty

531
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,860
it's not a pro

532
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,740
oh my god that is

533
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,800
that dated you right there and that's like

534
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,860
hollywood squares from the eighties is the only thing i ever remember seeing

535
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,200
charle from jen rivers

536
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,020
old jon rivers i'll be the best

537
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Oh my god, oh my god, can we talk? You're dancing? It's fucking awful.

538
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Oh my god. Talk to my daughter, Melissa.

539
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,020
What are those shoes? You're wearing

540
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,020
shoes with fire on them.

541
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Dude, my shoes kick ass. Don't talk about my burning feet.

542
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,020
I can just imagine the various other

543
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,020
announcers, like, you know, like

544
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:58,020
Paulie Shore, or Keanu Reeves, or Mike Myers doing the coffee talk lady.

545
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
You're dancing there?

546
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,020
You're dancing?

547
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
No.

548
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Now I'm eclipsed.

549
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Here's the topic.

550
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Here's the song.

551
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:14,220
Dance Dance Revolution is neither dancing nor revolution, discussed.

552
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,420
It would work.

553
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Oh my God.

554
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
Call me up and talk about it.

555
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
It's 555-4444.

556
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
You're dancing?

557
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,260
We'll talk no big whoop.

558
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
It's like butter.

559
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
You know, this song here.

560
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,260
Why don't you dance to this Barbara song?

561
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,700
I hope Bob would do it.

562
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,740
Black Lab suggests Carrot Top.

563
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
Oh my god!

564
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Down, down the center!

565
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,260
Yes, down the center!

566
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,740
Mr. T, I pity the food and don't play DDR.

567
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,540
And who else would we have?

568
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
Who else does a good one?

569
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,660
How about the movie guy?

570
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
The guy that does all the voice...

571
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
Mr. Movie Phone.

572
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Oh!

573
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Who had Mr. Movie Phone?

574
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,660
Hello!

575
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,420
And thank you for playing DDR!

576
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,820
If you would like to play, let them move! Press one now!

577
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,500
Nobody presses one!

578
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
This song is rated R for Language and Nudity!

579
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
The only person who presses one would be...

580
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I'm doing the copy guy.

581
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
I'm just going to do the copy guy.

582
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Alright! D.D.R.

583
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,500
D.D.R. Making copies.

584
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Anyway, that was pretty funny.

585
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
There's still more. I know there's more.

586
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Okay.

587
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Roseanne could be the female announcer.

588
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I can't even do Roseanne right now. I'm too strong.

589
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:35,860
wrong with your dance? You suck. You dance like you're fat. No, Margaret chose mom. Margaret

590
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:50,920
chose mom. Hold on! Louie Anderson. Your dancing is gay, but I'm not gay, I swear. Okay. I

591
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,480
can't do it as good as Travis does. If I try to do Louie Anderson, I feel like I have to

592
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,760
to throw back to him because he's the ultimate in Louie Anderson impersonating.

593
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,920
Ms. Cleo! Yes, thank you!

594
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,480
Oh, don't you know you get the first three minutes of Dancing Paws free? It's in the cards, it's in the cards.

595
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,680
But you have to pay in advance.

596
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,200
And send me all your money.

597
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,160
Because I don't read tarot cards. I read data bills.

598
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,840
Does Tarot have any suggestions?

599
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,640
No, but DSCS says everyone go to Fry's because they have Max USA early.

600
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,160
Well, poopy on Fry's. Too bad I already spent

601
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,880
five bucks pre-ordering it somewhere else yes thank you and all of you people

602
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,280
who did not reserve your copy at my fiance's game stop poopy on you

603
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,040
unless you don't live in town

604
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,000
they have it out right now

605
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,440
now everybody's going to run over there crap on that maybe they have it but that

606
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,160
doesn't mean they're out on the shelves

607
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,680
along with AT&T whose logo is the death star

608
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,960
ooh i get a sampler CD i can see what new crap's coming out on playstation

609
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,580

610
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,980
at the sampler set cd doesn't have animal crossing a metroid prime

611
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,860
i don't want to hear about it did metroid prime okay

612
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,740

614

615

metroid pride is the best

616
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,460
godly beautiful looking first-person shooter

617
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,780

618
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,560
like what is it

619
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,260
that's right what do you do why is it why do you want to introduce shit

620
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,480
and readiness

621
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,020
is it like to

622
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,740
kind of the instead of that and like to do it doesn't suck

623
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,660

625
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,620

contra shattered soldier it's related because it's coming okay

627
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,640
so i can talk about it

628
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,920
against his fucking disgusting looking

629
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,120
I walked downstairs with this blaring headache to watch them play the game

630
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,540
and they're beating this bloody turtle

631
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,600
up with these guns, they're shooting it to death

632
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,600
then the head falls off, the thing turns around and it has this fetus face coming out of its ass

633
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,080
I kid you not

634
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,120
Alright, for anybody who's ever played

635
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,440
Vampire Savior

636
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,240
and knows the

637
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,200
the fetus of god level

638
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,480
the face looks like the fetus from the fetus of god level of Vampire Savior

639
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,200
do doesn't suck i think that's a good sign i'm sorry so you said do suck so

640
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,440

641
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,320
uh... yet do sucks now

642
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,960
the head of the design back and remember when he used to call in the bd s is he

643
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,480
could play four-player doom out today

644
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,480
yeah i was thinking

645
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,120
well back to contract

646
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,360
yes i want to hear more about fetus ass babies

647
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,360
It's a big turtle with a fetus growing out of its ass.

648
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,360
You mean it's coming out of its booty?

649
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,360
It vomits fire on you.

650
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Yo, we're going to go down and play Contra.

651
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
We're going to shoot some shit up.

652
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:07,360
There's this other shape that looks like it's inside of some type of muscle cavity

653
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,360
that looks like it has sinews growing out of the top and bottom.

654
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
It looks like the inside of skin, and it's dripping blood everywhere.

655
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,360
That game is fucking disgusting, okay?

656
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,360
And look, he's doing the happy pee-pee dance.

657
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Do you need us to go to break?

658
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,360
The problem is, you know, with all these good games out,

659
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,360
I'm going to be spending about $150 on games this week.

660
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,360
And then the fact that I'm not going to work this week to play all these games, that's...

661
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,360
You will get your chance to play Contra later.

662
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,360
He's going yay.

663
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:47,360
I don't know. I think the last good Contra I remember was the one that was on Super Nintendo, because didn't they release ones on PlayStation that really sucked?

664
00:46:47,360 --> 00:47:03,360
Yeah, and the one on Genesis, though, it was a decent game, but it was really hard. Although the first Contra, this is what's kind of funny. The first Contra, you know, the palm trees in the first stage? On the Japanese version, they were animated and the game had an intro. It was pretty neat.

665
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,360
You know what really has me torn is that this week there's a couple of new albums coming out.

666
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
There's the new Tori Amos albums coming out.

667
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Yes, everybody loves Tori Amos.

668
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,360
I love being female.

669
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Especially me. I can't wait. I get to hear 20 more songs about somebody's vagina.

670
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,360
No, I'm just kidding. She doesn't sing about her vagina.

671
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
But most people assume that.

672
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,360
But she says, eat my pussy.

673
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,360
That's true. There is that recording I have where she told some guy at a concert to eat her pussy.

674
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,360
And then God, what else comes out this week? I think there's another big album coming out, I can't remember.

675
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:44,360
I never keep up with that. I'm busy stuck on my computer and playing DDR. Because I play to DDR.

676
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,360
That new Dance Mania album? I don't know. I think it came out on Friday, actually.

677
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,360
The inside of this is blue. With meat fire on it.

678
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,360
I'm looking in the inside of my demo disc case because I finally opened it and I've had it for two weeks.

679
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
You're just now looking at it?

680
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Yes.

681
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,360
Well, supposedly they ripped it out of the promo.

682
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Oh, I remembered what CD was coming out this week.

683
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
What?

684
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
No!

685
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,760
uh...

686
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,280
uh...

687
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,240
okay i need to go vomit so we're going to break right now

688
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,820
all right i'm going to regurgitate brought shoes

689
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,480
i'm gonna get my ass beat during this next break

690
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,760
uh... you said it

691
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:41,760
well you know i'm going to get my booty

692
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Alright, we're going to go to break. I'm going to start this break with something that Dave's

693
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,000
been begging me to play all night long. And it's going to make Jamie cry, but as long

694
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,640
as we're on her bad side, hey. This song makes both me and Duran Duran cry. Hello.

695
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,640
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

696
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:24,640
I came in from the rainy first day on the other night

697
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Thought I heard you talking so fast I sit on the light of TV and you're waiting

698
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:45,640
alone Still I can't escape the doorstep of you

699
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:52,640
What has been through it all, crazy some say

700
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Where is the life that I recognize

701
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Gone away

702
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,640
But I won't cry till yesterday

703
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,640
There's an ordinary world

704
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Somehow I have to find

705
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:27,640
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive

706
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,640
upbeat music

707
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,640
upbeat music

708
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,640
upbeat music

709
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,640
upbeat music

710
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,640
upbeat music

711
00:52:38,640 --> 00:53:00,480

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,480

Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

738
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:53,000
Go, let's go, right, go, pick up, let's go, let's go, right, go, there!

739
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,280
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

740
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,160
And Jamie's throwing a fit because...

741
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,440
They're raping my demo.

742
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,240
There were no new songs in the demo, hadn't been in the old demo, which kind of...

743
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
But they're synced.

744
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,560
They are synced.

745
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
In sync.

746
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,560
They are in sync.

747
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
In sync.

748
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,560
Bye, bye, bye.

749
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,520
No, I have names for them.

750
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,840
It's Instinct and 98.

751
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,560
Me and Dave are back there trying to see if they can get Max 300 in the demo, which I

752
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,240
told them they wouldn't be able to.

753
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,240
And?

754
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,240
No.

755
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,240
I knew it.

756
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,240
I knew it too.

757
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,560
I thought they were walking.

758
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,560
What can you do?

759
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,680
Are you playing with a ferret?

760
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,120
Oh, I'm supposed to talk about...

761
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,120
Crap!

762
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,120
Booty.

763
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
What?

764
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
Booty?

765
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Booty.

766
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Gimme my demo, bitch.

767
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:47,120
you

768
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,480
and

769
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,720
I was supposed to talk about what I got showed you guys during the very opening

770
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,160
break in the show up

771
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,320
SoCal kicks is helping us work on a new website

772
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,320
and I showed it off to everybody in the room during the first break

773
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,000
and it's pretty so far

774
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,240
so we can't wait to see the finished product so hurry up

775
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,400
I love getting other people to do work for me

776
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,720
thank you

777
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,000
I take back my fuck you, by the way.

778
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,320
Give me a dollar.

779
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,360
Let's see.

780
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,120
I'm checking little private messages here to see what's going on.

781
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,000
I sent somebody a letter in Animal Crossing that said, give me a dollar.

782
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,520
And they said it was the best letter that I ever wrote.

783
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,360
I also wrote another one that said, I like cheese.

784
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,560
You cannot eat cheese because you are a robot.

785
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,960
But you can cut it just fine.

786
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,920
And they also said that it was a wonderful letter.

787
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,080
It was moving.

788
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,720
Yes, it was.

789
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,040
It was like a bowel movement.

790
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,560
i'm sorry

791
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,000
dave i'm supposed to give you a special hello from right right she's listening

792
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,680
right now

793
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,480
yes i feel like she's still

794
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,520
uh... let's see

795
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,380
what else is there to talk about today any

796
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,220
well let's do

797
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,460
assume update promote the let's hear all about

798
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,000
what's going on in the same world

799
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,420
uh... nothing

800
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,920
i know there's a lot going on

801
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,060
yet that's that's going on out

802
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,840
well start the obvious stuff that's that mean

803
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,700
no ferrets

804
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,900
are part of that

805
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,900
okay anyways uh... steady at three finalists finally been released

806
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,260
so everyone go enjoy that they have

807
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:32,660
of course uh... prepare support and he did answer support and coming up support

808
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,700
So it's just a bit more than just DDR, so go try that.

809
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,860
And their editor kicks ass.

810
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,940
They use it for everything.

811
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Aside from that, let's see here.

812
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,140
DJ Bad's site is, of course, down at the moment.

813
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,980
Actually, it's because Music Gaming Zone's site is down.

814
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,940
Because he was using them as an affiliate, he's down as well.

815
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,740
So not too bad for that, because I needed the files.

816
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,700
But also, there's also my site.

817
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,220
And if anyone has been reading any of the boards lately,

818
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,620
I've announced that I'm doing a project where

819
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:12,020
I'm making a DWI for every single BeatMania 2DX song

820
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,660
out there.

821
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,260
So that started off pretty good so far.

822
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,340
I've been averaging about one song a day.

823
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,300
Right now I've got three of my originals up on my site.

824
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,260
I've got Love Is Orange, The Sound of Goodbye,

825
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,020
and of course another one for Sakura.

826
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,620
I have one of those.

827
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,620
Plus, I'm hosting some files for other people.

828
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,700
I've got a VJ Army by Moogle Hunter.

829
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,020
And there's a couple other files up there.

830
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,940
So go check it out.

831
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,780
It's www.leechfromloki.tk.

832
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,820
So go check that out.

833
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,100
It's pretty awesome.

834
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,100
Yeah, good shit.

835
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,980
Other than that, really not too much going on.

836
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,420
There's about 4 billion files out there for Sacros.

837
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,060
So if you don't like mine, go play someone else's.

838
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:58,900
Pretty much it, man.

839
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,900
Go play someone else's.

840
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,900
You don't like my stuff? Too bad.

841
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:07,900
Exactly. Other than that, you know, DDRPC, they released a nice Halloween-themed set of characters.

842
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,900
They have one guy...

843
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,900
Hey, I like the one character that looks like Jack from...

844
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,900
They're cool, but just DDRPC is kind of...

845
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,900
All right. DDRPC sucks ass.

846
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,900
The only reason I play DDRPC is because of the characters.

847
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,900
The only one that anyone really pays attention to is the last one.

848
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,900
Pantless Rage.

849
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,220
But if they had pantless rage, I'm sure it would get everyone's attention.

850
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,900
And three-titted Emmy, was it?

851
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,820
Three-titted Emmy and pantless rage.

852
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,820
Yeah.

853
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,420
From a long time ago.

854
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,700
How long ago was that?

855
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,980
Episode number seven.

856
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,940
Pretty sad I know that, huh?

857
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,140
Black Lab would like to hear from the ferret.

858
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:53,580
It says we need to give the ferret some air time, so go for it.

859
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,580
That was the ferret.

860
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,220
And now Jamie and I have something else to get out of our system.

861
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:06,220
We're looking at a picture of the guy I used to host under station live with, Travis, moved

862
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,220
to Texas.

863
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,220
Jenna's in the picture.

864
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,220
It's so cute!

865
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,220
I'm so happy.

866
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,220
Oh, it's so cute.

867
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,220
It's so cute.

868
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,220
Twen, no.

869
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,220
No four-titted sky.

870
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
Jesus.

871
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,220
What?

872
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,220
Oh, God, no.

873
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,980
But the ferret likes the idea of your...

874
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:26,740
How do we get that squealing out of our system?

875
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,100
JB says, oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this,

876
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,740
but I'm going to.

877
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,360
He's working on the graphics officially

878
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,740
for StepMania's PPP mode.

879
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:34,240
Winner.

880
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,980
Some local input.

881
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,580
Winner.

882
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,980
Para Para is cool.

883
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,660
Then we can finally do a Para Para to stuff like my baby mama.

884
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,220
Actually, that's one cool thing about the Para Para support

885
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,820
is it has the drivers built in for the actual controller.

886
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,860
So if you have a Para Para controller out there.

887
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:49,780
Which I do not.

888
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,020
And a USB port, you just plug it in and it works.

889
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:52,900
I have one.

890
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,700
So it's awesome.

891
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,140
Plug it in, in, in, in.

892
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,140
So yeah, look for that.

893
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,740
I bought it from George.

894
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,740
Go download it now.

895
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,820
I know it sometimes.

896
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,620
And oh yeah, DWI, well, they're still at version 2.03.

897
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,860
They've been at 2.03 for like months now.

898
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,460
I think DWI is dead.

899
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:11,860
We don't know.

900
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,660
They could come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden,

901
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,300
you know, it could be DWI extreme.

902
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,140
They're playing catch-up right now.

903
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:25,020
it's pretty bad ketchup they're playing ketchup no I'm not gonna play the

904
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:35,900
ketchup song do the dance near little mine Dave exactly speaking of DDR

905
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,060
extreme any other news new news that we're finding out about that I know

906
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,500
there were some pictures that came out and basically it just looks like max 3

907
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,660
so I have no idea why they'd bother to change the name for anyone who has a

908
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:50,340
live journal and is interested. There are people who are giving random updates now and

909
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:57,340
again on live journal community Beymani. Actually, I haven't seen many on the DVR live journal

910
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:03,600
community, but they have been doing updates on the Beymani community. There's been images

911
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,900
posted recently, so you might want to check it out.

912
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,660
It's just Max 3, isn't it? What's so extreme about it?

913
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:19,660
They're coming out, they're bringing back a lot of old songs that I've noticed, as well as a bunch of really good ones.

914
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:25,660
The whole thing is that they're just starting a new engine. That's just what it is. They're just changing names!

915
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,660
Max was a new engine!

916
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,660
Yeah, Max was a new engine. I mean, it was Max and Max 2, now Max 3.

917
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,660
So they're still tweaking it?

918
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:36,660
Max was a new engine. It had the full motion video, it had the freeze arrows, it was different enough to be a name.

919
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,660
So what is it going to do?

920
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,660
Who is extremely not different?

921
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,660
Vibrate or something?

922
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,660
Going to give you happy Joy Joy feelings?

923
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,660
It's green.

924
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,660
Dual Shock Dance Pad.

925
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,660
It's going to give you happy Joy Joy feelings in the special places.

926
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:54,660
The only real announcements that they made is a few of the songs that were only in the only modes are playable.

927
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,660
Like Jet World, that was one of them.

928
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,660
At least one hundred seconds.

929
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,660
That's cool.

930
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:09,020
What's so extreme? I still don't get it. From the pictures I've seen, there's nothing extreme

931
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,620
about it. Max 3.

932
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,260
Whenever they come out with a game series and they release an extreme version, he says

933
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,820
that means that it's the nail in the coffin. And you know, from what I've been hearing,

934
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,900
DDR is a dying game.

935
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,360
DDR is dying. But as I told Dan, lately it's been that if it's the last one, it's going

936
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,560
to be the final, so I don't think this is DDR the final yet. Nope, not yet. I don't

937
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,000
think it's the last one either. I don't think they've milked every single cent out of it

938
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,840
they can yet. And with Max coming out in the USA being pretty much, agreeably, the best

939
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:50,800
home release on any system yet, Matt's hand shot up in the air. Actually, I was just going

940
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:57,800
I want to mention something that you're mentioning, Max and stuff, and kind of DDR becoming more well-known and stuff.

941
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:06,800
On Thursday, Halloween, okay, they're going to have, actually it's going to be on CBS This Morning.

942
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,800
I think it's like the morning show, CBS Morning Show.

943
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,800
They're going to have from 7 to 9 p.m., or a.m., I'm sorry.

944
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Morning, hello.

945
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:24,800
Yes, they're going to be doing exhibitions for DDR on the show live, and they're going to be covering it throughout the whole show, which will get a lot of publicity, at least out there.

946
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,800
That's in New York, otherwise that would be fun to go to.

947
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,800
That means there's only going to be like five people who play good.

948
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,800
I don't know, there's a pretty good...

949
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
You're nice.

950
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,960
No, actually there is a pretty good DDR community in New York, and I found this out after you know having to

951
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
Keep an eye on the New York

952
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,980
Thread for a while, but you know yes

953
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:51,880
I've actually seen a few of the people from New York play at least in videos and things and there's a pretty good crowd there

954
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,500
So I'd really look forward to seeing that wasn't somebody from here flying out there or is that happening or?

955
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:05,500
I thought it was DJ 8-Ball that's going out there. Aren't they going to have to letterbox as you go?

956
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,500
No comment.

957
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that my outside voice? I'm sorry. Anyway.

958
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:19,500
That's not nice. We're a nice, friendly radio station, God damn it. Aren't we?

959
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:25,500
We're fucking wonderful people! We're nice, caring, wonderful, goddamn people!

960
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,500
And you love us! Worship us!

961
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Ah, Black Lab says nobody Jen will be there.

962
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,500
Yes, she's a member of RTF.

963
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,500
I haven't met her, but I've heard very good things about her.

964
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Yes.

965
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Cool.

966
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Except there's parts of her... I'm not going to comment on that, because I commented on that during...

967
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:50,260
When we made a suggestions for what would be scored on in the shaft journey, okay?

968
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,900
I'm sorry, but and she's really good for freestyle

969
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:59,520
But how is it going to score you points with judges by grabbing your boobs, okay?

970
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,000
As part of a routine I'd like to make a comment on that

971
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:10,700
Give me that microphone that you are not a host to give me the microphone that heavily weighs on score

972
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,700
I believe, man.

973
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,260
That is, grabbing one's boobs is not a show of talent.

974
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:21,740
If I grab my boob in the middle of a freestyle routine, will you give me a hundred?

975
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,900
Now I said it didn't count for you.

976
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:29,740
It might count against you, but I said it scores heavily, depending.

977
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,500
What if my boobs aren't very heavily?

978
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,420
A person should be judged on how well they perform, not grabbing your boob.

979
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,380
Hey, that's performance.

980
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,380
Yeah, maybe in a strip club.

981
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,380
But then like all the cheerleaders on the NFL teams and all the professional sports...

982
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,380
They're all sluts anyway.

983
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:51,380
But what if you grab your boobs on mirror mode? Then you're really fucked.

984
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,380
You remember the whole mirror thing?

985
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:02,380
You know, I believe that was, a year ago today was SCAT. October 27th, right?

986
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,380
Yes, it was.

987
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,380
Yes, a year ago today.

988
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:11,380
We are having our show on the anniversary of the sacramental cosplay and tournament

989
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,420
where we had four people cosplay.

990
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,700
But they were all very good.

991
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,700
Yes.

992
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,500
We had Ryan running around in his Afro Nova costume.

993
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,540
And it was funny because Ryan didn't even try to enter.

994
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,100
He just happened to dress up like the guy from Afro Nova.

995
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,100
And then he's like, hey, wait, cosplay?

996
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,100
I'll enter.

997
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,100
I like his routine too.

998
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

999
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,100
And we had

1000
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,580
Who else was there Fiona

1001
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,860
Dr. Hikaru

1002
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,540
Because we're nice. We're not going to comment on

1003
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:44,360
Yeah, great cosplay. Wonderful. Milia costume. Milia raised from Guilty Gear X

1004
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,820
we had

1005
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,820
Jossie in her

1006
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,980
her petite carat her putico outfit and

1007
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:59,020
And then we had, of course, Ryan Zafrenova costume, and then we had Satsuki as Devil

1008
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,660
Zuki, who Travis interviewed for that.

1009
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,660
That was hilarious.

1010
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,660
That was hilarious.

1011
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,660
Oh, shit!

1012
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,660
I need to get...

1013
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,740
I'm going to get those interviews from him and play them on this show sometime.

1014
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:09,860
I hope you're listening, Travis.

1015
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,860
I really, really, really want those interviews.

1016
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,660
You know, please, I know you want to give them to me now.

1017
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,660
It's great.

1018
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,660
With sprinkles on top.

1019
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,980
Sprinkles on top.

1020
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:18,980
I don't want sprinkles online.

1021
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,140
Those interviews were hilarious.

1022
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:25,620
I want them very bad. That's a bummer about him being in Texas, too, is now he can't do

1023
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,060
our Shaft interviews. But that's okay, because we're going to have Orange Lounge, hopefully,

1024
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:34,500
streaming all day long. Oops. Oops. Yeah. It was funny, because I remember he gave a

1025
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,660
little sex quiz to all the people that he interviewed, except Dr. Hikaru, because he

1026
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:46,660
was scared of what she might answer as, for some of the answers in the game. Yes, please.

1027
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:52,660
No, we are not here. Like I said, we are nice, god damn it, and we are going to behave.

1028
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,660
We are fucking wonderful people.

1029
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,660
We're going to behave like degenerates.

1030
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,660
Next, please.

1031
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,660
So, anyway, I guess...

1032
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,660
Travis wants to know what the hell I'm talking about.

1033
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,660
I think he just heard me say his name and he suddenly woke up.

1034
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,660
Since we're on the tournament discussion subject, though...

1035
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:09,660
Yes.

1036
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:20,220
Everyone, go to sackbamani.com, click on the link for SHAFT, go get some SHAFT, and there

1037
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:25,940
is the information about Sackbamani hosts another fabulous tournament, or as we like

1038
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:30,180
to say, Sackbamani hosts another fucking tournament, but you know, we're nice, so it's a fabulous

1039
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:37,180
tournament, with lots of prizes thanks to Loki.

1040
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,660
Your prize is a scat, or I'm sorry, a shaft.

1041
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,340
Almost everybody's walking home with something.

1042
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,660
You know, we go to so many tournaments and people are always like, well the same people

1043
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,660
always win.

1044
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,780
Well, if you show up, everybody's a winner.

1045
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Just about.

1046
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,700
We'll also play as last.

1047
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,180
We are also assuming everything works out properly.

1048
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:24,660
We are going to have a demo of DDR Max, the USA one.

1049
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,780
We are also, you know, we've been having these meetings.

1050
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,980
Basically the tournament is in two weeks.

1051
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:34,500
We're having, I've talked to a couple of people who are coming from out of state, which is

1052
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,500
going to be good.

1053
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,220
We're going to have a big turnout for this.

1054
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:43,580
You know, Scandia has really been wonderful in helping us.

1055
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,380
We're having a bake sale.

1056
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,980
If you want to contribute to the bake sale, bring us your, you know.

1057
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,300
I'm making arrow cookies for the bake sale.

1058
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,660
We need fro cookies too.

1059
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,660
And afro cookies.

1060
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,660
We need the afro cookies.

1061
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:58,620
and you know, we have Rice Krispie treats with, you know, little beat mania...

1062
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,740
We're gonna have beat mania bars.

1063
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,300
Yeah, we'll have beat mania bars and, you know, if anybody wants to

1064
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,300
wants to be in on the fun, you know, bring us your... We should like

1065
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:10,540
get pineapple and cut them into arrows and then we can have some fruity paras.

1066
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:15,300
Oh. Ha ha ha ha.

1067
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:19,140
You know, just bring it, you know, bake something and bring it. We'll sell it.

1068
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,460
You know, basically this is gonna help, you know,

1069
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:27,460
We're going to cover part of what we're doing for you guys.

1070
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:33,460
Also, we're coming up with a few more ideas for special prizes and drawings.

1071
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,460
Orange Lounge is going to be donating a prize.

1072
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,460
It's going to be an orange pack with all your orange needs.

1073
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,460
Including the possibility of an orange lounge.

1074
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,460
Yes, we're looking into that, seeing if we can get that to happen, an orange lounge share.

1075
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,460
We're trying to make that happen.

1076
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:55,300
The tournament is going to be big, you know, for any of you who can't afford to fly out

1077
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:00,240
from whatever country or podunk county you live in, feel free to.

1078
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,240
We like company.

1079
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,500
You can take a plane, you can take a train, you can take a bus, you can take a boat, you

1080
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,260
can walk, and if you're walking, leave now.

1081
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:18,420
And if you happen to be a paraplegic, you can squirm a quadruple amputee.

1082
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,420
You can roll.

1083
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,420
Yeah, come on down.

1084
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,420
You can skateboard.

1085
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,420
I have no thanks.

1086
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,420
I don't know that anyone else has seen that movie.

1087
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,420
It's a really random one. Anyway.

1088
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:34,420
DJ Morpheus says,

1089
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:38,420
Every tenth person there can get a free bottle of kaboom!

1090
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,420
Winner!

1091
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,420
Alright! Kaboom! The new orange!

1092
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,420
Dude, I'm going to put that in the orange.

1093
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,420
Thank you for the idea.

1094
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:51,420
We need to get little red bouncy balls and give them out as happy fun ball.

1095
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,420
It's fun! It's happy fun ball!

1096
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,420
We're gonna give bouncy balls.

1097
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,420
We're going to give you balls.

1098
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,420
They didn't even come to the tournament, because I say so.

1099
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,420
Come or die.

1100
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,420
Skate or die!

1101
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,420
That's dating you now.

1102
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,420
You know, I had my Charo reference.

1103
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,420
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

1104
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,420
What are we gonna do? Are we gonna talk about something else?

1105
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,420
Are we gonna do a list list? What do you want? List list for what?

1106
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,420
We'll think of something. We'll think of something. Okay this might be a long break while we think of

1107
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:30,420
what list list we're gonna do, but a surprise list list when we come back.

1108
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,420
I'm actually looking here on Orangelan's radio. I'm actually looking for a song

1109
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:38,420
to play. Play something. Anything. Like Kachaka.

1110
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:42,420
Oh Kachaka. I don't have Kachaka dammit.

1111
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:47,420
We're all hopelessly addicted to kachaka, even those of us who haven't been able to pass it yet.

1112
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,420
I'm looking for at least 100 seconds, I can't find it.

1113
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,420
Because it said we played it at this break.

1114
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,420
Shit.

1115
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,420
I know what we can play.

1116
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,420
Let's play the song.

1117
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,420
Let's play something that we played on Friday night's fucked up show.

1118
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,420
We're not playing dirty.

1119
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,420
No, we're not playing dirty.

1120
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,420
And we'll play...

1121
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,420
Kachaka.

1122
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,420
I don't have kachaka!

1123
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:17,420
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo we'll play some other shit. Enjoy.

1124
01:17:40,420 --> 01:18:04,420
I'm just walking down with my walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie.

1125
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:48,420
You can feel my love in my walkie-talkie Walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie, baby

1126
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:53,420
Don't let go, that's my walkie-talkie Walkie-talkie, walkie-talkie

1127
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,420
Every time you say you get in my mind

1128
01:22:53,420 --> 01:23:22,400
I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your Family wedding

1129
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:47,360
When's the next time that we're going to take out the remote kit and tape some shit?

1130
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,920
I guess shaft really.

1131
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,920
Hopefully, if it all goes well...

1132
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,920
We're gonna be doing the whole day.

1133
01:26:53,920 --> 01:27:00,920
Orange Lounge call broadcast is going to be broadcast straight from the Scandia Golf Course all day

1134
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,920
For those of you guys that can't make it...

1135
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,920
And we'll also rebroadcast it for those of you guys that are there

1136
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,920
I wanna hear it later. We'll rebroadcast it at some point.

1137
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,920
At least in bits and pieces.

1138
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,420
What do you mean the whole day?

1139
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,920
We're going to be broadcasting the tournament all day.

1140
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,920
I thought you meant like just having a normal show next week all day.

1141
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,920
That was weird.

1142
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:30,920
And since Jamie and I are going to kind of be busy with tournament stuff, I'm going to be out there doing a lot of the MC stuff and Jamie's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.

1143
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,920
We should have junior hosts.

1144
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,920
I'll only be able to get on the stream.

1145
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,920
We'll call them our cupcakes.

1146
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,920
Yes, our cupcakes.

1147
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:42,920
Tal will be MCing some of it and I'll be in the, oh he might be?

1148
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,920
I don't know what's going on.

1149
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,580
what's going on whatever from what I'm told I'll be doing part of it or

1150
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:52,680
something well depending on what's going on and I can get on the stream while

1151
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:57,080
that's going on do some interviews and in the meantime we'll probably get Loki

1152
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,680
on there some of your some familiar faces have been on the show in the past

1153
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,560
maybe Brad and Irene will be doing some interviews okay here I face some

1154
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,880
familiar voices that yes we'll be doing all the interview silhouette of my mind

1155
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,040
Alright, list list, let's talk about list list, shall we?

1156
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,680
Everybody knows what list list is, let's just go to it, no I'm kidding.

1157
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:24,640
This list list is basically best song that is in a DDR third mix or third Korean machine.

1158
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,640
But not second or first.

1159
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,220
So not second mix, we're leaving it to third mix.

1160
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:30,720
Something that came from some sort of third mix.

1161
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,600
And we are basically leaving it at that so that in the future we can have second mix

1162
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,780
as an option, and fourth mix as an option, et cetera.

1163
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,600
So let's start with the most special person in the room, me.

1164
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,480
If you want to contribute to List List,

1165
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,720
basically we're going to name our top three best third mix stuff.

1166
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,640
And then we'll have a big list.

1167
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,240
And then each one of us gets to remove an unworthy song from the list.

1168
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:00,400
And then the chat room gets to decide on the final list.

1169
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,360
Yes?

1170
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,280
And if anyone says Dynamite Rave, they get punched.

1171
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Don't punch!

1172
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,280
Don't punch!

1173
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,280
Okay.

1174
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,280
Yeah.

1175
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,280
Okay.

1176
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,880
I'm waiting to give the rob back, the mic back to Rob.

1177
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,880
We'll let, we'll let Rob start.

1178
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,880
I'm here.

1179
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:14,880
Wait, why do I have to start?

1180
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,880
Because I said so.

1181
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,280
I guess because I never start, huh?

1182
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,280
No.

1183
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,760
Oh, I'm also supposed to give a really quick announcement before I, because I'm cleaning

1184
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,760
out my PM windows and interpretation list list.

1185
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,960
23rd Magus wants any locals in Sacramento or Bay Area, I guess, to go to Scandia and

1186
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,960
bring your costumes.

1187
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,680
I don't know if there's going to be a contest or anything, but I'm just supposed to give

1188
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:08,680
song that I did on double. It was a four actually, but I failed.

1189
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,680
Oh okay.

1190
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,680
Actually I failed it the first time I ever played it.

1191
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:17,680
Yeah. This is tough. I've got like six choices. Okay, I'll go with the Boom Boom Dollar KOG

1192
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,680
mix.

1193
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,680
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1194
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,680
Because that's cool. And the trick one is really cool.

1195
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,680
KOG. Whatever. Oh, okay.

1196
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Oh, sorry. KOG. Oh, God.

1197
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,920
Big fucking deal. All right. Yes, Loki your number three choice

1198
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:38,640
It's gotta be do it all night. Do it all night. Oh, yeah

1199
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,360
I'm glad you put that on your list because I didn't

1200
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:49,340
My number three save the save the best for last ladies. Last is space face

1201
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:54,080
Awesome song face is pretty fucking cool

1202
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,080
My number two pick for best song on a third mix machine, If You Can Say Good-Bye.

1203
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,080
That's a good song.

1204
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,080
I love that song.

1205
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,080
Maybe the steps aren't the greatest, but the song is freaking amazing.

1206
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,080
The song is freaking rad.

1207
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,080
Your turn.

1208
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,080
And it's one that most people forget about, but it owns.

1209
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:20,080
Okay, my second choice is Song Suck, because I love the little thing in the middle.

1210
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:37,080
the middle. Next. No one can forget this. Afronova. Afronova. The song is fucking gay.

1211
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:46,200
The song is fucking gay. Caution. Just because I can sit and listen to that song on repeat

1212
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,200
for a full hour and not even realize it.

1213
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,200
Should I put Caution or Gengo?

1214
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,200
Most people know it as Caution.

1215
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,200
My number one choice...

1216
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Drum roll please.

1217
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,200
Drum roll please.

1218
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Please, I'm sure you all know this by now.

1219
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,200
My number one song is...

1220
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,200
Oh Nick, Please, Not So Quick.

1221
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
That song owns.

1222
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,200
Yes, because Rob is our erotic whore.

1223
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,200
I fucking love that song.

1224
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:12,200
Alright, that was the song that really got me hooked on DDR,

1225
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,200
so give it its credit please.

1226
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,200
Especially with karaoke mode.

1227
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,200
Okay, my number one choice is Beautiful 21C.

1228
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,200
Is that song on?

1229
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,200
Gotta go to who?

1230
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,200
Yes.

1231
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,200
Gotta go to hot do.

1232
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Yes, beautiful.

1233
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,200
See, he stole one of mine, so I'm gonna let him have it, though.

1234
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,200
I couldn't pick something else.

1235
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,200
No, you can't.

1236
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,200
Loki, your number one pick.

1237
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:37,200
No, this is probably gonna get a lot of flack for this, but this is the song that I've learned

1238
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,200
on one of the songs other than Pink Dinosaurs.

1239
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,200
It's not that song, okay?

1240
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,200
It's La Senorita.

1241
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:51,200
the

1242
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,860
and everyone pick

1243
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,960
gentle stress

1244
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,600
andy what not let them move

1245
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,600
uh...

1246
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,100
if that wasn't going on a really fast

1247
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:04,200
he's going up

1248
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,640

1249
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:10,160
uh... black lab is pitching a morning as we input get-up-and-dance on their

1250
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,800
for a reason

1251
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,640
i think that when you're going to get voted off

1252
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:18,000
no this look at the at the background is fucking rad we already found that out i

1253
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,480
believe that was the number one background voted in the previous episode

1254
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,520
but uh... the song song sucks anyway

1255
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,080

i'm not a huge fan of these uh... korean songs

1294
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,560

the ability with horrible choices left to make

1298
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:32,300
you have to eliminate one of these songs i fucking love playing all of these

1299
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:36,140
songs

1300
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:39,700
there are two that i'm putting back and forth in

1301
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,240
unfortunately the best ones that

1302
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,980
look at it

1303
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,600

01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,240
personal you know

1306
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:54,720
it she's not total personal vengeance

1307
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:04,200
So our list is, as soon as we have it posted to the chatroom, we have Flashdance, Do It

1308
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:11,040
All Night, Bass, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Senorita, and

1309
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,520
Gentle Stress AMD's Sexual Mix.

1310
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,880
Sounds good.

1311
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,200
And while you guys vote, we're going to take a minute and we're going to play one of those

1312
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,680
songs that totally got neglected from our list.

1313
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,280
So why you guys vote from it, and it's all day's fault, too, by the way.

1314
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,380
And we're going to play the full version of it, and you can send in your votes, and you

1315
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:33,100
got three minutes to do it, and then we're going to read the list when we come back here

1316
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,100
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1317
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,840
Make sure to send your votes in private message.

1318
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,120
Votes must be over private message to Sky in the chat room, or they don't count.

1319
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:47,120
sick of the ferret on you.

1320
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,120
Oh, yeah, you will be the one who made us all know

1321
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,120
Look out for your kind, oh, yeah

1322
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,120
You are the one who made us all know

1323
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,120
You are the one who made us all know

1324
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,120
Oh

1325
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,120
Baby, tell me why

1326
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:10,120
You say that love is not a possession

1327
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:14,120
You say that love needs fantasy

1328
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,120
You say we must hear this devotion

1329
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:21,120
But you don't say that you love me

1330
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,120
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing

1331
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,620
Sometimes I'm cold and serious

1332
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:32,620
But when you touch my body and close your eyes

1333
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:36,120
My little baby, I don't realize

1334
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:40,620
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

1335
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,620
You don't wanna love me just like I do

1336
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:50,620
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

1337
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:55,100
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

1338
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:58,100
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

1339
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:03,100
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

1340
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:00,780
Orange Lounge Radio.

1341
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:05,180
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we've just been doing a little list-list segment

1342
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:10,700
on the, what are we calling this, the best third mix or third Korean ever, right?

1343
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:14,620
Yeah, this is list-list third mix Korean plus.

1344
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,620
Okay, yes.

1345
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:22,100
So, without further ado, let's read the, let me read you what the list was that we had

1346
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,100
to pick from here.

1347
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:29,260
Flash Dance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C,

1348
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:32,060
La Senorita, and Gentle Stress AMD.

1349
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,700
And now, I reveal the results to you.

1350
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:35,700
Drum roll please.

1351
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:38,940
Jamie, will you please tell them what the number three song was?

1352
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:40,420
Fresh Dance.

1353
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,420
Fresh Dance, yay!

1354
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,760
Yay, a very good song.

1355
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,100
And the second place winner, Jamie.

1356
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,100
Gentle Stress.

1357
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,100
Yay!

1358
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,100
Because I had good taste.

1359
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,380
Gentle Stress.

1360
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:56,380
And the number one song, by an overwhelming margin, might I add, was...

1361
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,380
Jamie.

1362
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,380
Do It All Night.

1363
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,380
Yay!

1364
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:07,180
Do It All Night wins the bestest third Korean song ever.

1365
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,140
I want to say, I don't have bad taste, it's just everyone in the chat room who didn't

1366
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:15,180
vote for a beautiful 21C, because that song pwns so cool.

1367
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:18,740
And a beautiful 21C, by the way, got no votes.

1368
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,740
You know what we should do?

1369
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,740
What?

1370
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:26,740
We'll do it after birth or after the show.

1371
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:28,740
That's another thing I should add, by the way.

1372
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:32,740
In effect, to keep you people listening to the station, we're not going to drop listeners

1373
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:33,740
after the show anymore.

1374
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,740
We'll go right into music when the show is done.

1375
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:40,740
So you can stay tuned and hear random shit from Bemani and maybe more.

1376
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:41,740
Yay!

1377
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,740
It's bootylicious.

1378
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:47,740
They just don't shut up about that baseball game in the chat room.

1379
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:53,780
I guess the Angels one it sounds like right. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm falling asleep on the watch here my bad

1380
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,200
my bad

1381
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
No, my baby mama

1382
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,540
The chat rooms begging me to play the legend

1383
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,740
screw them

1384
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,540
After after bro, okay. We'll do the legend in the afterbirth

1385
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:15,000
Never playing that fucking other song again. No, we're not gonna play dirty. What?

1386
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
When you're MC'ing at Shaft, we need to still do the rave thing.

1387
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That'd be hilarious.

1388
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Except we're gonna get the biggest, like, you faggots look from the crowd.

1389
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
But that's okay.

1390
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
You got a problem with that?

1391
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
You can bite my big toe.

1392
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
That's right.

1393
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Jamie was teasing the idea earlier that we ought to take this show to three hours.

1394
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
What do you guys think?

1395
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Chat room, let us know, what do you think, three hours or what?

1396
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Or send us your comments over email, OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com.

1397
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,760
I said that if we do three hours, then the last hour is going to be all after birth.

1398
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,520
It's just going to get really random.

1399
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,240
We might start expanding into other types of video game things, like video game reviews.

1400
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:59,960
Well since Under Sedation Alive is, you know, off air in Sacramento, we can kind of roll

1401
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,600
over to something more like that show for the last hour.

1402
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,600
That could be quite possible.

1403
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,600
We could also...

1404
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
Possibility.

1405
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,600
I don't want to steal, but...

1406
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,060
We just have to do one big nerd fest.

1407
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,060
One big nerd fest.

1408
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,060
I like that.

1409
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:15,860
We do anime reviews, or we can have the random reviews, like my review of Contra Shattered Soldier.

1410
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:21,060
Yeah, but I know that I probably wouldn't be able to stay until 10, because I need to have a ride right now.

1411
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,060
I don't have a license.

1412
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:26,060
That'd be the overage part of the show. The legal part.

1413
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,060
That's when we all get drunk and smoke crack.

1414
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,760
And then in four months, I'll be right here, and I'll stay the whole time.

1415
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,460
Yeah, you gotta bring your own pipe.

1416
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,060
Your own crack pipe.

1417
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:37,860
Yeah, because we smoke crack when you leave.

1418
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:46,180
That was something else I was thinking about bringing to Shaft was getting some sugar crystals

1419
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,820
and selling crack at the bake sale, but it would just be sugar crystals, but I say crack

1420
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:51,820
rocks.

1421
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:52,820
That'd be funny.

1422
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:55,100
Orange Lounge crack.

1423
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,820
And yes, we're working on the phone call thing, so please stop begging.

1424
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:00,940
It's sad.

1425
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:01,940
We're working on the phone calls.

1426
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:02,940
We're going to be able to take those soon.

1427
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,740
And then we've got the new website coming.

1428
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:08,260
We're going to have a whole new season of Orange Lounge Radio before you know it.

1429
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,260
It'll be like Buffy.

1430
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,260
We'll go on forever.

1431
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:11,260
Yeah, it'll be like Buffy.

1432
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,740
We'll kill off Jamie.

1433
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,740
No!

1434
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:18,700
And then bring her back to life and introduce her sister she never knew about.

1435
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:24,460
Yeah, made from my genetic material and soul or something, and she's the next slayer.

1436
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:26,860
And then James Marsh is a nice vampire.

1437
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,200
Dude, Spike's hot.

1438
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,820
So what exactly would that be like?

1439
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:40,420
darker shade of hue Sakura or gray Sakura you know I'll be like like you know

1440
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:48,060
blacklight Sakura Oh glow you'll be rave Sakura I need a hug let me give you my

1441
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:53,220
son or better yet you'll be booty Sakura so let me give you my Sengoku

1442
01:46:53,220 --> 01:47:00,220
We got ten minutes left for the show.

1443
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,220
Time for you to get a watch.

1444
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:05,220
Time for you to shut up.

1445
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:09,220
Yeah, get a watch, slacker.

1446
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:12,220
Let's see, did I have anything else on the schedule for tonight?

1447
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,220
Nope.

1448
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:16,220
No, we're going to sit and talk about shit.

1449
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:19,220
Did you guys hear the fake Legend of Max MP3?

1450
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,220
No.

1451
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,220
You want to hear the fake one?

1452
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:24,220
We're going to play the fake Legend of Max.

1453
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:55,220
to congratulate Cory on his fun hoax.

1454
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:32,220
Sounds like a big techno industrial- I feel like raving, gimme a hug!

1455
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,220
Sounds happy hardcore.

1456
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:43,220
When I get an envelope full of light powder, my first impression is to snort it!

1457
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,220
Well even if it isn't- GONG!

1458
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,220
Hey, well even if- That's so Asian!

1459
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,220
GONG!

1460
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:55,220
gong

1461
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,200
mmm

1462
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,480
smells like dog

1463
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,340
action

1464
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:09,900
this is the most repetitive fucking song i've ever heard

1465
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:16,740
there's your free zero the big gone gone

1466
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:17,820
now i have your

1467
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:21,740
it over to the fat lady sings this

1468
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:26,340
there's the opera singer

1469
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,260
you know

1470
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:33,260
that we have a lot

1471
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:35,620
just call it

1472
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:41,900
if you go from the development

1473
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:45,820
sakura sounds more like max and the status or help

1474
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,160
i think that it

1475
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:52,020
I'd rather have it sound like that. You know, to be honest I'm kind of sick of Max and Max

1476
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:58,620
Unlimited and all the regurgitations of Max. That would have been a nice change for sure.

1477
01:49:58,620 --> 01:49:59,620
I agree.

1478
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:05,840
Speaking of MP3s that are probably fake, Pyro sent this to me before the show. We all know

1479
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:11,360
what that means. It's supposedly graduation by B4U, but lord knows what we're actually

1480
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:16,120
going to get when I double click on this file, because Pyro Man is our resident prankster

1481
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:20,520
in the chat room, so this could be a bunch of four-letter dirty words, it could be the

1482
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,720
Spice Network for all I know, but...

1483
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,480
It's gonna be like a four-minute fart.

1484
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:30,320
Which would be not too far from what an actual B4U song would sound like.

1485
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,320
True.

1486
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,640
I made a pun.

1487
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,560
Alright, let's see what it is.

1488
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,200
This is supposedly Graduation by B4U.

1489
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:49,200
Oh, the back singing indicates it's B.P.U.

1490
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:56,200
Maybe this really is it.

1491
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:08,200
You know what it is? I think it's dive backwards.

1492
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,200
Well, it's actually Japanese.

1493
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:16,200
Jamie's trying to see if she can hear the lyrics.

1494
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:29,200
I swear to God, this is probably just true or die played backwards.

1495
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,200
It's not.

1496
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,200
This is legit.

1497
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,200
Really? What are they saying?

1498
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,200
I only know or understood like five words out of this.

1499
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:57,200
Unfortunately the vocals are a little bit too low for me to hear over the music with the stuff that my head is.

1500
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:18,200
Well who knows, either we just gave you a world exclusive or you never heard that here.

1501
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
It was a messy song.

1502
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,200
The nasal singing of Be For You.

1503
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,200
JB brings up a good point. There's no announcer.

1504
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,200
It has the cheering, but there's no announcer.

1505
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:34,200
If it's from a test, it may not have the announcer in.

1506
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:39,200
I believe I read on Air in Japan that it has the same announcer as Max.

1507
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:43,200
Now, what if it was from a single or something like that?

1508
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,200
You ever know?

1509
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,200
Possibly be.

1510
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,200
Alright, so maybe that was graduation, maybe it wasn't.

1511
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:52,200
You just don't know anymore because there's too many damn people out there spreading fake fakers.

1512
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:59,200
the

1513
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,000
uh... you missed the voting but by about like ten minutes it was that

1514
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,240
twenty-third bag is sorry

1515
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,000
but even before he voted for los enorito

1516
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,200
it's

1517
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,880
that would have that would have made or break any ties so no worries

1518
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:18,600
i can't believe that survived the list anyway should've knocked out without

1519
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:19,900
skin

1520
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:23,900
it's good i was going to vote it off because it sounds like a mind thing is

1521
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,300
let me read that

1522
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,860
in uh... trick

1523
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:27,620
is fun

1524
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:31,380
it is because of the little skidded into that jump in you

1525
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,180
and even up

1526
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:34,220
what's your favorite newbie move

1527
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:35,740
everything

1528
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,460
i think there's less energy to skip to my favorite movie with either that or

1529
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,220
the clapping in the clock

1530
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:42,540
i would probably

1531
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,140
say that my favorite

1532
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:45,700
is actually

1533
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:49,700
in this image that i was doing two years ago by very ever first routine with the

1534
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:54,700
butterfly spin the butterfly bounce jump alright you know what I'm talking about

1535
01:53:54,700 --> 01:54:00,180
where you have your two jumps you stomp on on you alright for people who

1536
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:05,020
remember the steps for butterfly basic you've got right foot step jump and then

1537
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:08,460
you turn around and jump the other way but you bounce before you do it and I

1538
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:12,780
think it kind of looks neat and my other favorite one is the spins on love to me

1539
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:17,300
where they're like down up jump and then down up jump again and you do the spins

1540
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:24,820
I'm not sure if this is considered a newbie freestyle move or not, but I love the caution

1541
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:25,820
drop.

1542
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,820
It's so fun.

1543
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,820
I love the caution drop, too.

1544
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:28,820
I'm really tall, so it's really hard.

1545
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,820
But it's fun.

1546
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:35,260
I don't know if that's considered a newbie move or just an A-team freestyle type move

1547
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:36,260
or what.

1548
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:38,980
You have to be damn precise to make it look good, though.

1549
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:39,980
Yeah.

1550
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:42,500
Only little B can pull it off well.

1551
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,500
Yeah.

1552
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,860
The caution drop is cool.

1553
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:46,860
Great radio.

1554
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,860
I'm doing the caution drop for all of us.

1555
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:50,860
No, he's like, what's the caution drop?

1556
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:52,860
I'm like, here, let me show you.

1557
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,860
Do you have any favorite doofus?

1558
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:58,860
I used to do the knee drop on End of the Century.

1559
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,860
I thought I was all cool.

1560
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:04,860
I still do knee drops now.

1561
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:12,860
For my one edit for Ecstasy where it freezes on a knee drop in the center two arrows on doubles.

1562
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:15,860
I stopped doing that because it bruises my knees very badly.

1563
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:19,860
Did I still have, okay, this is where I compare scars.

1564
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:22,860
Abbruise, right there.

1565
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:26,860
For all those who can't see through the radio, she's pointing to her knee.

1566
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:28,860
Wait, I have, um...

1567
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:30,860
Dude, you have a scar.

1568
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:31,860
I do?

1569
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:32,860
Yeah, you have a little bit of a scar.

1570
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:37,860
Yeah, that's from playing bakwa, my routine, where I scraped my knee because I fell.

1571
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:49,140
I just remember being at Fana Mae last year, in my Emmy costume, doing my favorite Kamikaze

1572
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:54,120
drop on Love to Me, back when Love to Me was still kind of cool, going out into the hall

1573
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:59,020
with blood dripping down my leg from landing on a screw on that fourth class.

1574
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:04,860
For Shaft, I could do a rehash of my Dynamite Rave routine where I forget my steps about

1575
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:07,860
That started off so cool.

1576
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,860
15 seconds into the song.

1577
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:13,860
He pulls off the trench coat and everyone's like, oooh, and then he forgets his desk.

1578
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:17,860
He's like, oooh, crap.

1579
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:20,860
It was so awesome, the beginning of it.

1580
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:21,860
It was like the matrix.

1581
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:25,860
And actually, one of the coolest knee drops I've ever seen was also at the same font of

1582
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,860
me.

1583
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:33,060
A guy I know, Chris, did Dynamite Rave just as one of the characters from Guilty Gear

1584
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:40,060
X and did the corner knee drop where you step on the up and right and then knee drop down

1585
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,420
to the bottom and left diagonally. That looks really cool.

1586
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:47,540
You know I actually have a scar on my leg in the exact same place that Dave has one

1587
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:50,980
but it has nothing to do with DDR. It's from a game of Truth or Dare.

1588
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:55,820
Wow! Stand by to win! Wow!

1589
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:59,420
What's going on out there in the hall? Oh, I see. Oh, my roommate's on the phone. Too

1590
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,420
We can't broadcast over the air hi

1591
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:05,460
This is really good radio. It's great radio

1592
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:10,240
You know I actually like you know as much as people didn't complain about it

1593
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:17,460
I miss the old you know 18 style moves. Just because if you do them, right?

1594
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:23,380
Hilarity so amazing coordinated though and true their tired routines

1595
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:27,520
You know I like watching people do like real dance moves on DDR, and that's great

1596
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:32,520
And I would prefer watching that for different freestyle since I've judged a few tournaments before.

1597
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:39,520
But the 18 stuff, when done right, is so clean. And it looks really good.

1598
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:45,520
I miss the Chang'O's do-it-all-night routine. I love that.

1599
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,520
I don't miss him at all.

1600
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:54,520
I remember, was it his Ninzabur routine where he was like, what's that guy who brings out the Hammerin' Squad?

1601
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,720
days like the gallagher okay that means that

1602
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:03,080
yeah we squashed the watermelon in the that's too big

1603
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,260
okay

1604
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,360
it's like it's fine

1605
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:10,320
it's like to look i'm a hard to get me attention

1606
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,960
anyway

1607
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,420
okay

1608
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,700
jimmy ray

1609
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:19,040
we're going to smash a watermelon

1610
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,760
was funny

1611
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,760
It was stupid.

1612
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,760
On the point, it was random.

1613
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,760
It was still stupid.

1614
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,760
That's not funny, that's not something that wins a tournament.

1615
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,760
It's like two heads arguing back and forth.

1616
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,760
Random, stupid, random, stupid.

1617
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,760
Random is good, but only when it's funny random.

1618
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,760
I'm sure he didn't enter trying to win with that routine.

1619
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,760
It was still retarded.

1620
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:43,760
Speaking of random and stupid, this show is about over.

1621
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,760
Well actually, he won third.

1622
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:49,760
Dude, no.

1623
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,760
It just goes to show what lovely judges you can get at a tournament sometimes, right?

1624
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,760
It just goes to show people are easily amused.

1625
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,760
Anyways, we should talk about the movie Jackass.

1626
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,760
That movie rocks.

1627
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,760
No.

1628
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,760
Come up later.

1629
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,760
Jamie's not going to go see that.

1630
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,760
All right. Final thoughts, Jamie.

1631
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:04,760
Well, let's start with the cupcakes.

1632
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:07,760
Loki, any final thoughts here?

1633
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:12,760
Go check out my website if you haven't, www.leechfromloki.tk.

1634
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,760
Leave me a request for what 2DX song you want me to make into DWI next,

1635
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:25,120
next and I'll put it up there that's it I have nothing more to talk about I guess

1636
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:28,060
I'll talk about a movie that I want to talk about in the afterbirth not

1637
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:37,760
jackass but until then yeah okay they're talking about stuff and here's my final

1638
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:43,400
thought

1639
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,200
impressive

1640
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,520
god my nose hurts

1641
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:50,840
and my uh... final thought is i need a date

1642
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:53,480
date rob

1643
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:54,240

and that'll be the first song we play coming back

1650
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:11,100
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1651
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:14,880

02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:29,980
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1655
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:55,980
I think I'm beginning to understand.

1656
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,980
That's what I was going to say.

1657
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,980
Chris is our old partner, you know.

1658
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:02,980
Hey, we're partners, aren't we?

1659
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:04,980
Let's work together.

1660
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:06,980
Look at this. Wow.

1661
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:07,980
What is it?

1662
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:08,980
What do you think of it?

1663
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:09,980
Protect yourself.

1664
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:12,980
Perhaps that was the most important part.

1665
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:13,980
Let's go.

1666
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,980
Okay, I'll go first.

1667
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:17,980
Damn, it's broken.

1668
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,980
Seems like it.

1669
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,980
Oh my God.

1670
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:21,980
Hey, what's going on?

1671
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,980
Alright, can you do it?

1672
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:33,980
Lost courage already?

1673
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:38,980
I'm sorry for my lack of manners, but I'm not used to escorting men.

1674
02:01:38,980 --> 02:01:40,980
Jill, let's do it!

1675
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,980
Ah, yes, Barry!

1676
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:44,980
Jill sandwich, right.

1677
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:46,980
Barry, don't screw up again.

1678
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:53,980
up again. Let's go! Thank you, Barry. Is this a meeting room or something? Is that you, Rebecca? Yes. Rebecca, can you do it? Yes, I can! May I practice for a while? See? Just relax and play. Chris, look at this! Oh, you like it? Oh my God, that was great! I feel like we're having a secret meeting.

1679
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:18,980
Let's do it!

1680
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:23,980
Chris!

1681
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:24,980
Rebecca!

1682
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:25,980
Look at those monsters!

1683
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:26,980
He's insane!

1684
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:28,980
Yes!

1685
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:33,980
Chris?

1686
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:45,980
Well, I think I'll go out and get some fresh air for a change.

1687
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:51,980
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
