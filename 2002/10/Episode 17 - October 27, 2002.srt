[SPEAKER_13]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:15,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

[SPEAKER_03]: Robitussin!

22
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:27,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost said that on the pre-show list, except I don't have an editor to cut out all the talk and get me in.

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,061
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most shine-get radio station of all things Bomani.

[SPEAKER_03]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

27
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking, like, out of a box?

28
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:51,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you talking like the dying man?

29
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:52,597
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

30
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:57,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie is recovering from ickiness.

31
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a whole studio filled with guests.

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say hello to our guests.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they're not even really guests anymore.

34
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,622
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, they're always here.

35
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,842
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the back legs of the show.

36
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:06,683
[SPEAKER_03]: They're our mascot.

37
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: They're our dancing girls.

38
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,344
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit behind us.

39
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the back legs of the show.

40
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Loki.

41
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:11,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

42
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the uncredited member of the show.

43
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the guy behind the curtain.

44
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:16,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

45
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not stare behind the curtain.

46
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing to see here.

47
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:21,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Move along.

48
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Dave.

49
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Dave.

50
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a guy.

51
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a guy.

52
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,420
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that No Doubt song, I'm Just a Girl?

54
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:33,061
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

55
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:36,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe he really is just a girl.

56
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those evenings.

57
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Dave.

58
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:44,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break with some songs that we want to play for you.

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,852
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to take the children out for a walk.

60
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?

61
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:54,623
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm mad at you.

62
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,284
[SPEAKER_17]: I have never heard you crack that high of an octave.

63
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I am mighty impressed.

64
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:23,479
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a pretty impressive range, but I keep singing.

65
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:23,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a fan.

66
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You should go kick Paula Terry's ass.

67
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:26,119
[SPEAKER_03]: You could sing.

68
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:26,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a fan.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,460
[SPEAKER_03]: You could sing Dive.

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I will just take my saxophone and beat her up.

71
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I want a Jamie mix of Dive.

72
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,122
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the karaoke version.

73
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:38,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie doesn't sing.

74
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're getting a Jamie mix of Dive.

75
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,663
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be done on Kazoo.

76
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:45,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for that.

77
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll be right back.

78
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a real quick break and we're going to start with the fuck you's of the week so send those to me over private message.

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,202
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be in our chat room and just send those over to Skye, S-K-I-E and then we'll read those.

80
00:04:57,242 --> 00:05:01,904
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be the first thing because Jamie's got a lot she wants to say and I'm very, very scared.

81
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:02,664
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can I say?

82
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:04,725
[SPEAKER_17]: My voice doesn't give up before then.

83
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only hope.

84
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in a little bit.

85
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:08,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

86
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,693
Thanks for watching!

87
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,551
Thank you.

88
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:45,911
Thank you.

89
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:46,811
Thank you.

90
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:22,599
and many more.

91
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

92
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,494
[SPEAKER_03]: You leave for a week and everything goes to hell.

94
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:53,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And the show goes to hell.

95
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:59,083
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, on top of that, I miss seeing my gay boy action, okay?

96
00:10:59,123 --> 00:10:59,324
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

97
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:00,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I miss Yali Park.

98
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us all about... And I was there.

99
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, tell us all about what you were leaving for...

100
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

101
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's sending their alarm like right outside my window.

102
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:16,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, tell everybody about why you left last weekend, what the plan was that you were going to be gone for, and what ended up making you late and all that.

103
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:20,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to go to Yaoi Con because I wanted to go by Dojinshi because, damn it, I'm a nerd.

104
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:25,445
[SPEAKER_17]: So Julie says, okay, well, we're going to leave in the morning after my class.

105
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,586
[SPEAKER_17]: So they canceled her class.

106
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:30,789
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't matter because Julie still didn't get to my house until six in the evening.

107
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Describe Yaoi for everybody who may not know.

108
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove

109
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I drove by there and I was like, well, that's pretty cool.

110
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

111
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dark Tetsuya lives by Man Love.

112
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying.

113
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:19,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, anyway, I was going to go to YaoiCon so I could, you know, look at all the pretty art and watch the pretty anime and see the pretty boys.

114
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,618
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, see cosplayers and stuff.

115
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,440
[SPEAKER_17]: So we get there and we decide that it's late, so we go to Pacific East Mall.

116
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,062
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not in Berkeley, but near Berkeley.

117
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:29,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, hold on.

118
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Do cosplayers for yaoi like dress up as naked men or something?

119
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,200
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

120
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:36,201
[SPEAKER_17]: God.

121
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

122
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:45,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So I go and I have this chat with this really nice guy there about the Trueno, because I want one.

123
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:54,167
[SPEAKER_17]: For people who have no knowledge of Toyotas or Initial D, it's basically it was the Corolla in Japan, so.

124
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,968
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want one, and I actually liked the car before I ever heard of the anime.

125
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, we ended up just hanging out.

126
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:08,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, your horn works, you whore!

127
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,622
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's not picking up over our microphone, somebody's honking the horn quite obnoxiously outside.

128
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:14,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jamie's going to go do something about it.

129
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,628
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope the mic picked that up.

130
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie just went over to the window and went,

131
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to do a show!

132
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, we go hang out at Krista's house.

133
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:38,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, we went to San Francisco and picked up Krista, who was working at the convention with a Japanese guest.

134
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:41,487
[SPEAKER_17]: What?!

135
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,471
[SPEAKER_17]: The people outside are screaming.

136
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,211
[SPEAKER_17]: This is, okay.

137
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,412
[SPEAKER_02]: We just heard the N-word.

138
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Away from the bad radio.

139
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:55,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, we drove all over San Francisco.

140
00:13:56,186 --> 00:14:00,788
[SPEAKER_17]: We ate at Mizune and Kintetsu Mall.

141
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:02,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Went back, crashed out.

142
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Got up the next day with the full intention of spending the $30 to get into the convention so we could go shopping in the dealer's room.

143
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,931
[SPEAKER_17]: And, oh, don't forget, pay $15 to park.

144
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

145
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisco can go to hell and die for costing so much to park in.

146
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:20,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we went all over the place and Julie and I sat back and we went, you know what, fuck that.

147
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,560
[SPEAKER_17]: We decided not to go to YowieCon.

148
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,624
[SPEAKER_17]: So we went all over the place and spent a bunch of money instead.

149
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we walked Krista's dog in Berkeley.

150
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:29,947
[SPEAKER_17]: We get back.

151
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,509
[SPEAKER_17]: We decided that we were going to go to Network Video because we thought we had time.

152
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,090
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't realize that we got back at 5.

153
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Network Video being the local import video game store?

154
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:38,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Local meaning Bay Area.

155
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,316
[SPEAKER_17]: We had an hour to get there.

156
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:41,717
[SPEAKER_17]: So we get in the car.

157
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,478
[SPEAKER_17]: We're on our way to Network Video.

158
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,322
[SPEAKER_17]: We get stuck in evil traffic going into San Francisco.

159
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:52,358
[SPEAKER_17]: It took us an hour just to get past the toll booth from Berkeley to there.

160
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,060
[SPEAKER_17]: I call Rob at, what, 6-something?

161
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Rob, guess what?

162
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:58,864
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in traffic at the toll booth.

163
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Going into San Francisco.

164
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:07,011
[SPEAKER_17]: So, finally, you know that really weird phone call where, you know, I couldn't hear anything?

165
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:10,514
[SPEAKER_17]: That was me calling from Mifune again over my Oyako Donburi phone.

166
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,191
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

167
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:35,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Golden Girls Poster

168
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

169
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,612
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a Golden Girls poster and I want some cheesecake.

170
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:03,213
[SPEAKER_17]: I need to do my Fuck You of the Week because I have my Fuck You of the Week.

171
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:04,894
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting into the Fuck You of the Week.

172
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:05,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that nice segue.

173
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:06,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

174
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, my Fuck You of the Week goes toward JJ North's cheesecake today.

175
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: JJ North is... JJ North sounds like... It's like a hometown buffet.

176
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a clothing store.

177
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:21,444
[SPEAKER_17]: But for people that are back east, it's also like the Piccadilly, basically.

178
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not necessarily like Piccadilly, because that's more of a cafeteria type place.

179
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,347
[SPEAKER_17]: It's basically a big buffet.

180
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:29,110
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, just all kinds of crappy food that's been sitting out for five hours.

181
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I hadn't eaten at JJ North in forever.

182
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,455
[SPEAKER_17]: And Waffle Square, okay, damn them, they were busy.

183
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,157
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be Chicken and Waffle Square.

184
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:38,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Full of old people.

185
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:42,628
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we decided to go to JJ North's because I was actually feeling good today.

186
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:46,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I went home early Friday because I was sick, as you can't tell from my face.

187
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, that was gross.

188
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:52,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So I go, and I'm all happy because the food sucks and I want a cheesecake.

189
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,176
[SPEAKER_17]: I eat a cheesecake and it tastes like the meringue topping from a lemon meringue pie.

190
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:56,957
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really gross.

191
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:58,998
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, that sucks.

192
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,939
[SPEAKER_17]: My second fuck you of the week goes to Rob.

193
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,200
[SPEAKER_17]: For... Yay!

194
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Christina sluttier and stuff behind my back on Friday.

195
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:07,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

196
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:08,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, bitch!

197
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:34,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We played like a bunch of really... Oh, we played that Legend, the Legend song, the Zelda rap.

198
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about, right?

199
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to play that tonight for our regular listeners.

200
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

201
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still on yours.

202
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:46,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah, and to intro the Dirty songs, I played Dirty.

203
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:47,936
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a chat room.

204
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a chat room that made me play the full version.

205
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:53,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Specifically, it was... Specifically, it was SoCalKicks.

206
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:54,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that I'm going to point fingers.

207
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,258
[SPEAKER_17]: SoCalKicks, you can bite me.

208
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,019
[SPEAKER_17]: No GameCube pen for you.

209
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,462
[SPEAKER_17]: You still have to send me proof.

210
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we tried doing the ghetto phone thing on the show, but it doesn't really work.

211
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:04,687
[SPEAKER_17]: That's okay, chat room.

212
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:05,688
[SPEAKER_17]: I really love you guys.

213
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,893
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, I miss you all, but my aim is improving.

214
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:11,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I practice.

215
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:12,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, I do.

216
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:18,904
[SPEAKER_17]: My other fuck you of the week goes toward all of you who gave me this cold.

217
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:27,446
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this virus, cold, bacteria, needs to die already because I'm getting sick of being sick.

218
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:28,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sick of being sick?

219
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:30,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yeah.

220
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:40,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and my other Fakula League goes toward, um, um, Contra Shattered Soldier because it was really loud and I wanted to go to bed last night.

221
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:43,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

222
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Which, oh, everybody's going to be hearing about that later because it's Konami and damn it, I say so.

223
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, do we have any other FUs of the week in the house?

224
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Next.

225
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:56,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to Dave.

226
00:18:58,194 --> 00:18:58,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Loki's next.

227
00:18:58,935 --> 00:18:59,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Loki!

228
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, I gotta find Loki's music.

229
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:03,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Name my song!

230
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:11,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a song for Loki, but I have to find it.

231
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill in, just start, I'll cue in your music later.

232
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, first FU goes...

233
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Please stop.

234
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:20,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

235
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, first FU goes to my fucking headache.

236
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:27,362
[SPEAKER_04]: because my head hurts and it doesn't feel good.

237
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:31,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably from ice training and me staying up until 4 in the morning working on my website.

238
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so F you to my stupid headache.

239
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And also F you to the stupid movie Transporter.

240
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,730
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it, that movie is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

241
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a waste of your time.

242
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, it doesn't have any redeeming parts of it at all.

243
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just crap.

244
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap Disguise like a good action movie.

245
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:59,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, actually another FU to a movie that's going to be coming out, Extreme Ops.

246
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme sports and spies do not mix.

247
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop trying to do that.

248
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: What was Triple X?

249
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Vin Diesel.

250
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's a beefcake, so it's okay.

251
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, hey, this is Fast and the Furious as a spy.

252
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:16,428
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

253
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:17,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme Ops.

254
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bald James Bond.

255
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Extreme Ops.

256
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,411
[SPEAKER_03]: A bald, fat James Bond.

257
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:27,155
[SPEAKER_04]: These people happen to go up to this, like, lodge, and, oh, there happens to be a terrorist base in this lodge.

258
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought that there's a terrorist base in this lodge?

259
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, what are the odds of that?

260
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's one of the most notorious criminals, too.

261
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, who would have thought that?

262
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the odds of that happening?

263
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, could you repeat that for our audience here?

264
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, will you finish?

265
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes, I'm finished.

266
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

267
00:20:54,918 --> 00:21:02,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have much of a fuck you, but fuck you weekdays for being really long.

268
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:02,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Giants are one.

269
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,182
[SPEAKER_05]: In the fourth inning was Giants 1, Angels 4.

270
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,872
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not sports talk, this is Ben Mani.

271
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on with the fuck yous.

272
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:25,593
[SPEAKER_17]: On with the fuck yous.

273
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, fuck you weekdays for having five of them compared to only two weekend days.

274
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:38,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Because weekends are cool and weekdays are shit because there is school or work for whoever has work.

275
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:38,897
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

276
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:46,098
[SPEAKER_17]: All of you people in Japan are lucky because women get one PMS day a month to call in sick.

277
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,179
[SPEAKER_17]: We need that in America.

278
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,791
[SPEAKER_17]: so that I don't have to bitch at people at work and I can just stay at home and bitch.

279
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:54,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Back to you.

280
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:55,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's it.

281
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:58,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

282
00:21:58,533 --> 00:21:59,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I get one.

283
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:00,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I get one.

284
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:09,316
[SPEAKER_03]: My fuck you of the week is the fact that drinking inhibits one's ability just to drive.

285
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,008
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't do anything stupid.

286
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But last night I went out to the local bar, the local number one bar.

287
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was the designated driver.

288
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And my two friends I was with were the designated drunks.

289
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm drunk, I have a lot more fun.

290
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I have to drive, so I can't do any drinking.

291
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't stop me from having a pebble shot when we first got there, which, by the way, is Red Bull mixed with Malibu.

292
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:38,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good, you should try it sometime.

293
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:41,657
[SPEAKER_17]: But of course, since I was there for four hours... Red Bull is the color of piss.

294
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And it smells like pussy, what's your point?

295
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:45,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

296
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:52,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, it took, uh, we were there for four hours, so I wasn't driving drunk or anything.

297
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:53,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I had plenty of time to get that out of my system.

298
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:59,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But my two friends, when they get very drunk, they're bold as hell and just, you know, have a lot of fun.

299
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:00,194
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, a lot of fun.

300
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:06,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I, uh, I had fun, but I was just kind of just sitting there, kind of, yeah, I'm the driver.

301
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:08,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee.

302
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But my costume owned.

303
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:11,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys saw my costume.

304
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see my costume on my journal?

305
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:13,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.

306
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:14,584
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

307
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a milk box with the missing and then it went on your head.

308
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:19,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it was a big hat.

309
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big milk carton that says missing and it has my head in it.

310
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure somebody will post a picture in the chat room.

311
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:25,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody will post a link to the picture of my Halloween costume.

312
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,810
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had 24 chocolate covered espresso memes.

313
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, my FU is towards DUIs.

314
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Do people need to come and help me make my costume?

315
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:36,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I've been lazy.

316
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:38,213
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had the stuff to make my costume now.

317
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's get to the chatroom FUs.

318
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:53,730
[SPEAKER_03]: JB says, F you to Nobody Buying Me the new Jenny Rom single, Ika Uka.

319
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if that's new.

320
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:55,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said it was.

321
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And also to Makeup for Not Coming Off, Stupid Halloween Makeup.

322
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check it out at his journal.

323
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:04,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too lazy to give the URL, so he'll have to post that in the chat room.

324
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to his math book for having a Spanish glossary or whatever.

325
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It made him mad because I couldn't find the English one.

326
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:13,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

327
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,652
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCalKick says, fuck you, Weekend, for being boring as fuck, and funk you, Sky, funk, I said funk.

328
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.

329
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:26,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck you, Sky, for superliminally making me expose myself.

330
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:27,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, whatever.

331
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,097
[SPEAKER_03]: He exposed himself in the chat room.

332
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,044
[SPEAKER_03]: He pulled down his pants and made us cry.

333
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Twin says... I'm just kidding.

334
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:41,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so going to get smacked.

335
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:49,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Twin says F you to his arcade for having to send the DDR boards and kit to some guy to get it upgraded to Max 2.

336
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:54,899
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to never being able to get on early enough because of his damn mother.

337
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,823
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to GJBadSite for going completely down for the past two days.

338
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:00,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

339
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:07,325
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a super secret message for Loki, and then F you to people who watch baseball.

340
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, DJ Bad's site isn't down.

341
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the download section is.

342
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: He has his GeoCity site still up, though.

343
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:15,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

344
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, and I don't watch baseball.

345
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: My parents do, and they're all like, Yeah, it's 4-1 Angels!

346
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:21,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever.

347
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:23,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they like the Giants.

348
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:24,739
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, that's not the point.

349
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is I don't watch it.

350
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki seems to like it, so... Can I continue?

351
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,164
[SPEAKER_17]: The point is that Cal Expo...

352
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:34,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Continuing on with the FUs of the week.

353
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus says, I have a big fuck me to all available ladies.

354
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:45,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, my fuck you is to Philips and ATI for making drivers that free step mania.

355
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you mentally deficient coders.

356
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:49,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait.

357
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in the chatroom wants their own theme music.

358
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

359
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:54,317
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

360
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:59,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyro Man says, F you to AIM and their goddamn identical windows because of this.

361
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:01,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck!

362
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:06,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I just typed, yay, this porno is almost done downloading to this chick I like.

363
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:08,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking wrong instant message windows.

364
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh, I've so ruined my chances with her.

365
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:13,697
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why you say, ha ha ha ha, that was funny.

366
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:15,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha, joke.

367
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:17,158
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to come over and watch?

368
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:24,162
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like that cable, or what was it, that beer commercial or something like that where the woman comes over.

369
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, is this the adult channel?

370
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, yes it is.

371
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, like, you know, they advertise the beer or something like that.

372
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:36,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcadian in the chatroom is indicating DJ Bad might be back up, so go look.

373
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:38,558
Yay!

374
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I already did those FUs.

375
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:46,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, DarkTetsuya says, Fuck you to McDonald's for having happy meals of both Transformers and Hello Kitty.

376
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude!

377
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:49,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that a bad thing?

378
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true, you have to choose.

379
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:55,790
[SPEAKER_17]: I want the boy kind.

380
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, that'd be cool.

381
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I don't... Transforming Hello Kitty.

00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you win.

00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:05,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, anyway.

384
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:14,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And Black Lab says, F you, number one, to fuck this 1600 word paper that is due tomorrow that he hasn't started on yet.

385
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:14,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

386
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:21,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck his roommate for missing his train at 8am Saturday, thus ruining his chances for a peaceful weekend to myself.

387
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Black Lab and his pornography collection.

388
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:25,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

389
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:32,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck his roommate again for bringing home some girl last night and making out until all hours of the morning while I was still in the room.

390
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you don't do that shit with your roommate in there.

391
00:27:36,411 --> 00:28:04,182
[SPEAKER_17]: and you don't do that shit with your roommate I lived in a dorm room, hello you do not have people over making out in the dorm room when your roommate is there you pay your roommate to go play at the arcade unless she's really hot and swings that way, so but anyway you still go somewhere else to make out it's courteous I don't want to listen to two people sucking on each other unless I'm allowed to participate

392
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,550
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you feel left out.

393
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:15,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Scorecard.

394
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackLadsFUs are always fun.

395
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:22,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

396
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:28,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck shitty Verizon brand phones for sucking ass and shitting off at... Oh, shutting off.

397
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:30,730
[SPEAKER_03]: He left out a vowel, so I put in my own.

398
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:34,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And shitting off at random times and not hold...

399
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:35,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

400
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:36,548
[SPEAKER_03]: He got cut off.

401
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: His Verizon phone cut him off.

402
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:42,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

403
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:43,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the chatroom FUs.

404
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:44,279
[SPEAKER_17]: We're done.

405
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: No more FUs in the chatroom.

406
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:49,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, everybody.

407
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always get up and do the catch-up song dance.

408
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:52,786
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

409
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:53,066
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

410
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:54,206
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

411
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,567
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually have a happy fuck you, though.

412
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:57,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you do?

413
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you have a happy fuck you?

414
00:28:58,168 --> 00:28:59,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a happy one.

415
00:28:59,528 --> 00:28:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

416
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:00,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I need happy music.

417
00:29:00,888 --> 00:29:01,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Happy and special.

418
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:03,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I need happy music.

419
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happy music?

420
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... No, I'm not doing it to do Petite Love.

421
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:11,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Cutie Chaser.

422
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:12,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

423
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:15,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And... Go ahead and start.

424
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:15,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cue in the music.

425
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want dead air.

426
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:17,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Well...

427
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Nintendo has gone and done it again.

428
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,778
[SPEAKER_17]: I am once again addicted to one of their products.

429
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's hear it for Animal Crossing.

430
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:33,807
[SPEAKER_17]: I have been coming home worrying about my virtual mortgage and how the hell I'm going to pay it off with fish and bugs.

431
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:38,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Tom Nook is an asshole and I want Mallory to move out of my village.

432
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,213
[SPEAKER_17]: The fucking duck bitch needs to move.

433
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:43,616
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hate that bitch Phyllis at night in the post office.

434
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:46,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, they need to gut her.

435
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Just do her over an open fire!

436
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about a video game, might I remind you?

437
00:29:52,144 --> 00:29:52,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes I am!

438
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:57,946
[SPEAKER_17]: And dammit, Lobo is cool because he's a big wolf and he's up until 3 in the morning.

439
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,328
[SPEAKER_17]: But fuck you Nintendo and thank you.

440
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,569
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Animal Crossing and I hate you bitches.

441
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:05,670
[SPEAKER_16]: But I need to play more Kingdom Hearts 2.

442
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:11,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, that's my happy thing is that I'm finally with the times.

443
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:16,492
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that know me, I am so behind the times when it comes to like regular mainstream video games.

444
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:19,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just now playing through Final Fantasy X, right?

445
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,936
[SPEAKER_03]: But I finally was able to make a trade tonight.

446
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I traded off my 2DX controllers to my neighbor who lives like two blocks up the street.

447
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's not really my neighbor, but he lives two blocks up.

448
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:30,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And in return I got Kingdom Hearts!

449
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:32,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So I finally get to play and see what the big fuss is about.

450
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:33,806
[SPEAKER_17]: You know all the cool kids are playing Animal Crossing.

451
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, where have you been?

452
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,527
[SPEAKER_05]: My next fuck you, my fuck you goes to money.

453
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:40,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't have enough money.

454
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:04,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I need more money because I can't afford a GameCube and I can't get Animal Crossing.

455
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:11,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie tells me how much fun it is and I get to see how she has all her cute little shirts and stuff and I can't play because I'm poor.

456
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:17,486
[SPEAKER_17]: He gets to listen to me yell at Mallory because she's a stupid bitch and yell at all the people.

457
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:22,471
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I did design the coolest outfit and it was inspired by my Gothic and Lolita Bible.

458
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had a silent moment.

459
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:33,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Rob.

460
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:34,845
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

461
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob totally broke my concentration.

462
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Blame him for the train wreck.

463
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:39,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you, Rob.

464
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:43,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So when are you going to do your random shows?

465
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:44,408
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll buy you more orange balls.

466
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:45,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

467
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:47,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jamie, for buying me big orange balls.

468
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

469
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some big, fluffy, squishy orange balls, and I put them in my mouth before the show.

470
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, he did, but I didn't watch because I had cupcakes.

471
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had snowballs, so you perverts can, you know, go to hell.

472
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:02,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do they call him Snowball?

473
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:06,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you spit them into your girlfriend's mouth.

474
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:14,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, random.

475
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Go watch Clerks, all of you, right now.

476
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:20,250
[SPEAKER_17]: You poor, deprived people.

477
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,231
[SPEAKER_12]: I see my buddy Travis joined the chat room, so I want to say hello.

478
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you're listening.

479
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,031
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so cool.

480
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everything's going good for you in Texas.

481
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:29,692
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for you.

482
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:36,034
[SPEAKER_12]: The stars at night shine big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.

483
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:38,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so going to get smacked.

484
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:40,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I want to watch Pee Wee now.

485
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the second Pee Wee reference I've made tonight.

486
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty scary.

487
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:47,037
[SPEAKER_03]: When I yelled at the people across the street.

488
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:52,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, the people across the street, by the way, have been quiet.

489
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the thing is, I would have been inspired again by Animal Crossing by taking my axe and treating them like a tree.

490
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:01,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And cutting them down.

491
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that you would have chopped up their booty?

492
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the word of the night is booty.

493
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything associated with the booty.

494
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,062
[SPEAKER_14]: You say the ass, we say my baby mama.

495
00:33:16,443 --> 00:33:20,226
[SPEAKER_20]: I ain't gonna ask you what the word of the day is again, okay?

496
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:25,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, bitch.

497
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:29,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, that is the word of the evening is booty.

498
00:33:33,717 --> 00:33:35,419
[SPEAKER_14]: At least we're not raving again, okay?

499
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:39,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Although the raving was pretty fun.

500
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:41,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

501
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us, what was that remix we heard right before the show started?

502
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That mix of Sandstorm and... And Children, the Robert Miles song.

503
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:56,766
[SPEAKER_17]: This was, I went home after the rave show and decided, you know what, I don't have this song on my computer and I kind of want it.

504
00:33:57,366 --> 00:34:01,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So I went on Kazalite, yay, because it's the only thing that will work with my firewall.

505
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:04,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And I went downloading Sandstorm.

506
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,570
[SPEAKER_17]: I downloaded one that was called Children of the Sandstorm.

507
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,590
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

508
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,362
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tentatively Tuesday from what I understand.

509
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:29,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Game stops are getting there.

510
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:32,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hearing Monday, Tuesday.

511
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hearing all sorts of days.

512
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:35,327
[SPEAKER_17]: I have my unopened demo in my purse.

513
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami is shipping it out this week, and whenever the stores get it, they get it.

514
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And then your grubby little hands can go buy it.

515
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,393
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what we could do during one of the later breaks?

516
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:42,673
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

517
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Go put in my demo.

518
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:47,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the demo you've got is the same demo, but it's synced.

519
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:48,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you actually see it?

520
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:51,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you played that?

521
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it.

522
00:34:53,353 --> 00:34:55,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the PlayStation Magazine demo.

523
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:56,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you actually see the demo?

524
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw the demo that you got.

525
00:34:58,595 --> 00:34:59,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

526
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:00,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go out and hook it up.

527
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,457
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that during one of the breaks.

528
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

529
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:12,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the newer version of the demo, because I guess what happened is that the original PlayStation Magazine demo was actually an older version of the demo, and the arrows were all missynced on two of the songs.

530
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that nice?

531
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:15,333
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

532
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:44,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a really weird thing to have in a home version because most people haven't spent the hundred bucks on an ignition pad and most people don't have metal pads.

533
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:55,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are playing with those ghetto little pads, either, you know, the, what do they call them, the beat stage pads or what are those things called, the ghetto ones you can buy at Fry's.

534
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those called?

535
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,853
[SPEAKER_17]: The ass pad.

536
00:35:58,893 --> 00:35:59,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the ass pad.

537
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:05,238
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy these ass pads and that's what most people play with.

538
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I say booty?

539
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:09,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

540
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Ass booty.

541
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,718
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in.

542
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:13,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Internet access.

543
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, the Margaret Cho fans would get that.

544
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:21,418
[SPEAKER_03]: DeadAir.

545
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Oni's Fries.

546
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: People buy these booty-ass pads at Fries.

547
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:30,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

548
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:34,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you play Oni mode on these really crappy pads.

549
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:44,577
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be halfway across the room by the time you finish, and there's no way you're going to be able to keep... You're not even going to be able to pass that dumbed-down-for-Americans Oni, the lesson Oni, or whatever it's called.

550
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not even going to be able to pass that on most normal homepads.

551
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:48,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems very odd to me.

552
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they do non-stops.

553
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we'd have non-stops, but I didn't think we'd have only.

554
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit I'm surprised.

555
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:57,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this is what we have on the back of the demo, though, for DVR Max.

556
00:36:57,703 --> 00:36:58,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay!

557
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,524
[SPEAKER_17]: On one of the images, it has screen capture of the select list.

558
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:08,868
[SPEAKER_17]: We have healing vision, insertion, let the beat hit him, look to the sky, love again tonight, midnight blaze, paranoia evolution, Orion 78.

559
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,408
[SPEAKER_17]: It says over 70 songs.

560
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, over 70 songs.

561
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:16,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see.

562
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just reading this.

563
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:36,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

564
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:38,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolutionary to the max.

565
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:43,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The evolution of the revolution is here with DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution.

566
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:51,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Get ready to experience maximum dancing with all new songs and game modes, high energy pulsating music, and stunning graphics.

567
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:54,933
[SPEAKER_03]: The ultimate dancing game is now revolutionary to the max.

568
00:37:55,993 --> 00:38:02,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Diary, that guy who wanted to be just like a sick was reading the back of the American version of Dance Dance Revolution.

569
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Just listening to his voice makes me all excited in special places.

570
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:08,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Love, Naoki.

571
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:22,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think I've seen that screenshot before about a couple weeks ago.

572
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:26,943
[SPEAKER_17]: But we can also check that out during one of the breaks and see what's available on the demo.

573
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:34,666
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing, though, that I did note is that the demo disc is one of the blue CDs, which means it's not DVD.

574
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:41,908
[SPEAKER_17]: If the last release of Max is any indication, the one that came out for PS2 in Japan, it's also on a CD.

575
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:47,770
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm sort of thinking that the new one's not going to be on a DVD, so we may be seeing video sacrifices.

576
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,210
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure.

577
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

578
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be on DVD.

579
00:38:52,941 --> 00:39:00,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I think that you should do the intro and be the announcer for the DDR Max, because you read a lot better than the announcer right now.

580
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:05,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Konami, if you're out there listening, I want to be the new announcer, so send me a letter.

581
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:06,513
[SPEAKER_03]: or something.

582
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:07,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot me an email.

583
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:10,375
[SPEAKER_17]: You should just get the guy from Ridge Racer to do it because he sounds like the original announcer anyway.

584
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:12,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

585
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got everything on camera so you can watch it again.

586
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:15,877
[SPEAKER_17]: You're the greatest.

587
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:20,899
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCalKicks is stamping his foot and insisting that DDR Max USA is on a DVD.

588
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:21,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's confirmed.

589
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that means.

590
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get Bobcat, whatever.

591
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:26,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobcat Goldthwait.

592
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:27,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

593
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: He would be the best DDR announcer.

594
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:33,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you fucked up.

595
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:36,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you suck.

596
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, but I think you suck.

597
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:46,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else?

598
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:47,729
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good topic.

599
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else would be a good DDR announcer?

600
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Bill Cosby.

601
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:54,694
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play DDR and have a put-in-pot.

602
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:58,858
[SPEAKER_03]: What about female announcers?

603
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Charo, oh my god, that just, that dated you right there, that's like, Hollywood Squares from the 80s is the only thing I ever remember seeing Charo from, and Joan Rivers, oh, Joan Rivers, that would be the best, oh my god, oh my god, can we talk, you're dancing, it's fucking awful, oh my god, talk to my daughter Melissa, what are those shoes, you're wearing shoes with fire on them,

604
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:30,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, my shoes kick ass.

605
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't talk about my burning feet.

606
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:34,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

607
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:43,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I could just imagine, though, various other announcers, like, you know, like, Pauly Shore.

608
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:44,871
[SPEAKER_17]: Good suggestion.

609
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:46,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Pauly Shore, that's an excellent one.

610
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:47,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

611
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:49,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Or, like, Keanu Reeves.

612
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, you know DDR.

613
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:57,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are Mike Myers doing the coffee talk lady?

614
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:58,395
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're suggesting there?

615
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:01,129
[SPEAKER_12]: You're dancing?

616
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:02,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm eclipsed.

617
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Dance amongst yourselves.

618
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:05,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the topic.

619
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's the song.

620
00:41:06,391 --> 00:41:09,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Dance Dance Revolution is neither dancing nor revolution.

621
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Discuss.

622
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:14,736
[SPEAKER_17]: It would work.

623
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:17,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

624
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:18,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Call me up and talk about it.

625
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,839
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 555-4444.

626
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:21,720
[SPEAKER_17]: You're dancing?

627
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,841
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like butter.

628
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,122
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this song here.

629
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:27,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you dance to this Barbara song?

630
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:28,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard Barbara do it.

631
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Lab suggests Carrot Top.

632
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:33,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God.

633
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:35,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Dial down the center.

634
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. T, I pity the food and don't play DDR.

635
00:41:44,824 --> 00:41:45,725
[SPEAKER_17]: And who else would we have?

636
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:47,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

637
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:48,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else does good?

638
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the movie guy?

639
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that does all the voice?

640
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Movie Phone.

641
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:55,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello, and thank you for playing DDR.

642
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,272
[SPEAKER_03]: If you would like to play, let them move.

643
00:41:58,392 --> 00:41:59,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Press 1 now.

644
00:41:59,873 --> 00:42:00,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody presses 1.

645
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,035
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is rated R for language and nudity.

646
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,898
[SPEAKER_14]: The only person who presses 1 would be... Doing the copy guy.

647
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:09,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, DDR.

648
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,480
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR, making copies.

649
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:17,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that was pretty funny.

650
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:17,999
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still more.

651
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's more.

652
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:19,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

653
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Roseanne could be the female announcer.

654
00:42:23,223 --> 00:42:24,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't even do Roseanne right now.

655
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,825
[SPEAKER_20]: What is wrong with your dance?

656
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:28,827
[SPEAKER_17]: You suck.

657
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,148
[SPEAKER_20]: You dance like you're fat.

658
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:33,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Margaret, no, Margaret chose mom.

659
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Margaret chose mom.

660
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:36,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Mom!

661
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:39,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Louis Anderson.

662
00:42:39,814 --> 00:42:40,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis Anderson.

663
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:47,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Your dancing is gay, but I'm not gay, I swear.

664
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

665
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it as good as Travis does.

666
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: If I try to do Louie Anderson, I feel like I have to throw back to him because he's the ultimate Louie Anderson impersonating.

667
00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:00,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Cleo, yes, thank you.

668
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:04,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, don't you know you get the first three minutes of dancing for free?

669
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,790
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in the cards.

670
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,470
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in the cards.

671
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,731
[SPEAKER_17]: But you have to pay in advance.

672
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:09,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Send me all your money.

673
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:12,151
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't read tarot cards.

674
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:12,952
[SPEAKER_17]: I read database.

675
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the chatroom have any suggestions?

676
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:20,678
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but DSCS says everyone go to Fry's because they have Max USA early.

677
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:22,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, poopy on Fry's.

678
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad I already spent five bucks pre-ordering it somewhere else.

679
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:27,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you.

680
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:33,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of you people who did not reserve your copy at my fiance's GameStop, poopy on you.

681
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless you don't live in town.

682
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:36,551
Wait a second.

683
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:38,233
[SPEAKER_05]: They have it out right now?

684
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:40,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everybody's going to run over there.

685
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:44,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe they have it, but that doesn't mean they're out on the shelves.

686
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Along with AT&T, whose logo is the Death Star.

687
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I get a sampler CD.

688
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see what new crap's coming out on PlayStation.

689
00:43:55,237 --> 00:43:55,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

690
00:43:56,618 --> 00:44:01,461
[SPEAKER_03]: If the sampler CD doesn't have Animal Crossing or Metroid Prime, I don't want to hear about it.

691
00:44:01,562 --> 00:44:02,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Metroid Prime.

692
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:03,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

693
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:06,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Forget Mimani for a second.

694
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:10,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie hates first person shooters, and I love Metroid Prime, thank you.

695
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:12,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss the trash can too.

696
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Metroid Prime is the most godly, beautiful looking first person shooter ever.

697
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:20,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell us more about it.

698
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:22,634
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like... What is it?

699
00:44:23,615 --> 00:44:25,236
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Metroid, but it's like... What do you do?

700
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:26,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they make it first person?

701
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,538
[SPEAKER_17]: You walk around and shoot shit.

702
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:29,199
[SPEAKER_17]: In prettiness.

703
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like Doom?

704
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of, but unlike Doom, it doesn't suck.

705
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:41,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here's my sort of fuck you because it really pissed me off last night, but it's kind of a cool thing.

706
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Contra Shattered Soldier.

707
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:45,960
[SPEAKER_17]: It's related because it's Konami, okay?

708
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,060
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can talk about it.

709
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, this game is fucking disgusting looking.

710
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:53,202
[SPEAKER_17]: I walked downstairs with this blaring headache to watch them play the game.

711
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,480
[SPEAKER_17]: and they're beating this bloody turtle up with these guns.

712
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,340
[SPEAKER_17]: They're shooting it to death.

713
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Then the head falls off, the thing turns around, and it has this fetus face coming out of its ass.

714
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I kid you not.

715
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:14,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, for anybody who's ever played Vampire Savior and knows the fetus of God level, the face looks like the fetus from the fetus of God level of Vampire Savior.

716
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom doesn't suck.

717
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:19,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I say Doom sucked?

718
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:19,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Doom sucked.

719
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:21,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you said Doom sucked.

720
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:22,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Doom sucks now.

721
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Doom sucks now.

722
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:30,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom didn't suck back in... Remember when you used to call into BBSs so you could play four-player Doom?

723
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the day.

724
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:32,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I was playing Doom.

725
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

726
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, back to Contra.

727
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I want to hear more about fetus ass babies.

728
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:48,763
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a big turtle with a fetus growing out of its ass.

729
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean it's coming out of its booty?

730
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:55,188
[SPEAKER_14]: It vomits fire on you.

731
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:57,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Yo, we're gonna go down and play Contra!

732
00:45:57,809 --> 00:45:59,810
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna shoot some shit up!

733
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:10,316
[SPEAKER_17]: There's this other shape that looks like it's inside of some type of muscle cavity that has sinews growing out of the top and bottom.

734
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:13,377
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like the inside of skin, and it's dripping blood everywhere.

735
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:15,979
[SPEAKER_17]: That game is fucking disgusting, okay?

736
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:18,480
[SPEAKER_17]: And Loki's doing the happy pee-pee dance.

737
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need us to go to break?

738
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:26,288
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, you know, with all these good games out, I'm going to be spending about $150 on games this week.

739
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fact that I'm not going to work this week to play all these games, that's... You will get your chance to play Contra later.

740
00:46:36,934 --> 00:46:37,874
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going yay.

741
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:39,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

742
00:46:39,855 --> 00:46:43,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the last good Contra I remember was the one that was on Super Nintendo.

743
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:46,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Because didn't they release ones on PlayStation that really sucked?

744
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and the one on Genesis, though, it was a decent game, but it was really hard.

745
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:54,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Although the first Contra, this is what's kind of funny.

746
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:57,634
[SPEAKER_17]: The first Contra, you know the palm trees in the first stage?

747
00:46:57,874 --> 00:47:00,115
[SPEAKER_17]: On the Japanese version, they were animated and the game had an intro.

748
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:02,696
[SPEAKER_17]: It was pretty neat.

749
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:07,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what really has me torn is that this week there's a couple new albums coming out.

750
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,379
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the new Toriyamis albums coming out.

751
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:12,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, everybody loves Tori Amos.

752
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:14,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I love being female.

753
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially me.

754
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:16,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.

755
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to hear 20 more songs about somebody's vagina.

756
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:20,270
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

757
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,751
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't sing about her vagina.

758
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But most people assume that.

759
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But she does eat my pussy.

760
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:25,553
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

761
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,995
[SPEAKER_03]: There is that recording I have where she told some guy at a concert to eat her pussy.

762
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:32,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, God, what else comes out this week?

763
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:33,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's another big album coming out.

764
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:34,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

765
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:37,606
[SPEAKER_17]: I never keep up with that.

766
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:40,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm busy stuck on my computer and playing DDR.

767
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:42,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I play to DDR.

768
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:45,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That new Dance Mania album?

769
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:48,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

770
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it came out on Friday, actually.

771
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:51,193
[SPEAKER_17]: The inside of this is blue.

772
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:54,335
[SPEAKER_17]: With meat fire on it.

773
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:58,737
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking in the inside of my demo disc case because I finally opened it and I've had it for two weeks.

774
00:47:59,398 --> 00:48:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just now looking at it?

775
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:00,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes. 75%

776
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:10,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, supposedly they ripped it out of the promo.

777
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:12,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remembered what CD was coming out this week.

778
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:13,019
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

779
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

780
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:24,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I need to go vomit violently.

781
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to break right now.

782
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:29,332
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm going to regurgitate and rob shoes.

783
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:33,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get my ass beat during this next break.

784
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:35,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh oh, you said it.

785
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to kick my booty.

786
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:46,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go to break.

787
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:51,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start this break with something that Dave's been begging me to play all night long.

788
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to make Jamie cry, but as long as we're on her bad side, hey.

[SPEAKER_03]: SoCalKicks is helping us work on a new website.

826
00:58:57,466 --> 00:58:59,906

827
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:01,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty so far.

828
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't wait to see the finished product.

829
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:04,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry it up.

830
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:05,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

00:59:05,468 --> 00:59:05,968
[SPEAKER_03]: It's orange.

832
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:07,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I love getting other people to do work for me.

[SPEAKER_17]: Give me a dollar.

836
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It was moving.

837
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:37,666
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it was.

838
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:39,267
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like a bowel movement.

839
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:43,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, I'm supposed to give you a special hello from Rai Rai.

840
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:44,451
[SPEAKER_03]: She's listening right now.

841
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

842
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:48,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, hi.

843
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,255
[SPEAKER_17]: He likes cheese, too.

844
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:53,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

845
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:56,962
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is there to talk about today?

846
00:59:57,622 --> 00:59:59,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a sim update from Loki.

847
00:59:59,684 --> 01:00:02,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear all about what's going on in the sim world.

848
01:00:04,529 --> 01:00:04,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

849
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's lots going on.

850
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:07,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth.

851
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a ton of stuff's going on.

852
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:12,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with the obvious stuff.

853
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:13,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Step Mania.

854
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:16,550
[SPEAKER_04]: No ferrets.

855
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,920
[SPEAKER_04]: are part of the Sim Update.

856
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:26,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyways, Step Mania 3 Final has finally been released, so everyone go enjoy that.

857
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:38,851
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, of course, Para Para support and Easy to Dancer support and Pump It Up support, so it's just a bit more than just DDR, so go try that, and their editor kicks ass, they use it for everything.

858
01:00:39,991 --> 01:00:46,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Aside from that, DJ Bad's site is of course down at the moment.

859
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:49,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's because Music Gaming Zone's site is down.

860
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was using them as an affiliate, he's down as well.

861
01:00:56,175 --> 01:00:58,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too bad for that because I needed their files.

862
01:00:59,796 --> 01:01:02,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's also my site.

863
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:07,378
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone has been reading any of the boards lately, I've announced that I'm doing a project

864
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:12,441
[SPEAKER_04]: where I'm making a DWI for every single Beatmania 2DX song out there.

865
01:01:13,822 --> 01:01:17,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So that started off pretty good so far.

866
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:19,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been averaging about one song a day.

867
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:23,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I've got three of my originals up on my site.

868
01:01:23,348 --> 01:01:28,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Love is Orange, The Sound of Goodbye, and of course another one for Sakura.

869
01:01:29,072 --> 01:01:29,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one of those.

870
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:32,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus I'm hosting some files for other people.

871
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:35,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got VJ Army by Moogle Hunter.

872
01:01:35,877 --> 01:01:37,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a couple other...

873
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:39,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Files up there.

874
01:01:39,024 --> 01:01:39,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So go check it out.

875
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:44,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.leachfromloki.tk So go check that out.

876
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.

877
01:01:47,054 --> 01:01:47,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good shit.

878
01:01:49,114 --> 01:01:51,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, really not too much going on.

879
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:56,356
[SPEAKER_04]: There's about 4 billion files out there for Sakura, so if you don't like mine, go play someone else's.

880
01:01:58,036 --> 01:01:58,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much it.

881
01:01:58,777 --> 01:01:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play someone else's.

882
01:01:59,837 --> 01:02:01,517
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like my stuff, too bad.

883
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:01,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

884
01:02:02,337 --> 01:02:07,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, DDRPC, they released a nice Halloween-themed set of characters.

885
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: They have one guy...

886
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like the one character and it looks like Jack from... They're cool, but just DDRPC is kind of... Alright, DDRPC sucks ass.

887
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:20,944
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I play DDRPC is because of the characters.

888
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:24,306
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one that anyone really pays attention to is... Pantless Rage.

889
01:02:25,586 --> 01:02:29,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if they had Pantless Rage, I'm sure it would get everyone's attention.

890
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:32,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And Titless... Three-Titted Emmy, was it?

891
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Three-Titted Emmy and Pantless Rage.

892
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:34,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

893
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,561
[SPEAKER_05]: from a long time ago.

894
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: How long ago was that?

895
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode number seven.

896
01:02:40,846 --> 01:02:41,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sad I know that, huh?

897
01:02:42,768 --> 01:02:44,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Lab would like to hear from the ferret.

898
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Says we need to give the ferret some air time, so go for it.

899
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:54,203
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the ferret.

900
01:02:54,494 --> 01:02:56,895
[SPEAKER_03]: and now Jamie and I have something else to get out of our system.

901
01:02:56,915 --> 01:02:58,736
[SPEAKER_17]: So cute!

902
01:02:59,016 --> 01:02:59,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So cute!

903
01:02:59,637 --> 01:02:59,937
[SPEAKER_17]: So cute!

904
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:07,921
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at a picture of the guy I used to host Under Station Live with, Travis, moved to Texas and Jenna's in the picture.

905
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenna-chan!

906
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:09,242
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so cute!

907
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:10,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so happy!

908
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:11,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so cute.

909
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:12,543
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so cute.

910
01:03:12,603 --> 01:03:13,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Twin, no.

911
01:03:13,364 --> 01:03:14,564
[SPEAKER_03]: No four-titted sky.

912
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:15,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.

913
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:16,225
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

914
01:03:16,985 --> 01:03:17,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, no.

915
01:03:19,947 --> 01:03:20,808
[SPEAKER_03]: The parent likes the idea.

916
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:24,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we got that squealing out of our system.

917
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:29,676
[SPEAKER_03]: JB says, oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I'm going to.

918
01:03:29,756 --> 01:03:32,459
[SPEAKER_03]: He's working on the graphics officially for Step Mania's PPP mode.

919
01:03:33,735 --> 01:03:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Winner!

920
01:03:33,995 --> 01:03:34,716
[SPEAKER_03]: From local input.

921
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Winner.

922
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:36,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Parapara's cool.

923
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can finally do a Parapara to stuff like my baby mama.

924
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:49,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's one cool thing about the Parapara support, is it has the drivers built in for the actual controller, so if you have a Parapara controller out there... Which I do not.

925
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,032
[SPEAKER_04]: And a USB port, you just plug it in and it works.

926
01:03:52,052 --> 01:03:52,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one.

927
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:53,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's awesome.

928
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:54,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Plugging it in and in and in.

929
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:56,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, look for that.

930
01:03:56,056 --> 01:03:56,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it from George.

931
01:03:57,679 --> 01:03:58,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Go download it now.

932
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's sometimes... Oh yeah, DWI, well, they're still at version 2.03.

933
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:08,644
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been at 2.03 for like months now.

934
01:04:08,884 --> 01:04:10,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I think DWI is dead.

935
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:11,806
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

936
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:15,868
[SPEAKER_03]: They could come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden, you know, it could be DWI Extreme.

937
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,588
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing catch-up right now.

938
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:18,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty bad.

939
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:21,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch-up.

940
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,131
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing catch-up.

941
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:25,654
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to play the catch-up song.

942
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:27,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the dance in your little mind, Dave.

943
01:04:28,696 --> 01:04:29,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Please don't.

944
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:32,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

945
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:38,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of DDR Extreme, any other new news that we're finding out about that?

946
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there were some pictures that came out, and basically it just looks like Max 3, so I have no idea why they bothered to change the name.

947
01:04:45,008 --> 01:04:50,652
[SPEAKER_17]: For anyone who has a live journal and is interested, there are people who are giving random updates now and again

948
01:04:51,753 --> 01:04:53,054
[SPEAKER_17]: LiveJournal.com

949
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:16,096
[SPEAKER_17]: They're coming out, they're bringing back a lot of old songs that I've noticed.

950
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:19,682
[SPEAKER_17]: As well as, as long as a bunch of really good ones.

951
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:21,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing is that they're just starting a new engine.

952
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:22,927
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just what it is.

953
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:25,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, they're just changing names.

954
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:25,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

955
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:28,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Max was a new engine.

956
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was Max and Max 2, and now Max 3.

957
01:05:30,356 --> 01:05:31,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So are they still tweaking it?

958
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Max was a new engine.

959
01:05:32,737 --> 01:05:34,177
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the full motion video.

960
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:35,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the freeze arrows.

961
01:05:35,618 --> 01:05:36,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different enough to be in the name.

962
01:05:36,978 --> 01:05:37,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is it going to do?

963
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely not different.

964
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Vibrate or something?

965
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings?

966
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:43,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's green.

967
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Dual shock dance pad.

968
01:05:46,138 --> 01:05:49,343
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings in the special places.

969
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:55,012
[SPEAKER_04]: The only real announcements that they made is a few of the songs that were only in the only modes are playable.

970
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Jet World, that was one of them.

971
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:57,336
[SPEAKER_17]: At least 100 seconds.

972
01:05:58,484 --> 01:06:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: My fiance said something Whenever they come out with a game series and they release an extreme version He says that means it's the nail in the coffin

973
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:24,887
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, from what I've been hearing, DDR is a dying game.

974
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,388
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR is dying.

975
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:31,511
[SPEAKER_17]: But as I told Dan, lately it's been that if it's the last one, it's going to be the final.

976
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:34,273
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't think this is DDR the final yet.

977
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:35,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, not yet.

978
01:06:35,414 --> 01:06:36,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's the last one either.

979
01:06:37,315 --> 01:06:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've milked every single cent out of it they can yet.

980
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:46,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And with Max coming out in the USA being pretty much, agreeably, the best home release on any system yet.

981
01:06:47,562 --> 01:06:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's hand shot up in the air.

982
01:06:49,898 --> 01:06:57,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was just going to mention something that, you know, you're mentioning Max and stuff and kind of DDR becoming more well-known and stuff.

983
01:06:58,484 --> 01:07:06,490
[SPEAKER_04]: On Thursday, Halloween, okay, they're going to have, actually, it's going to be on CBS this morning.

984
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like the morning show, CBS morning show.

985
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:23,980
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be doing exhibitions for DDR on the show live, and they're going to be covering it throughout the whole show, which will get a lot of publicity, at least out there.

986
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad it's in New York, otherwise that'd be fun to go to.

987
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:30,063
[SPEAKER_17]: That means there's only going to be like five people who play good.

988
01:07:30,962 --> 01:07:33,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, there's a pretty good... You're nice.

989
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:45,248
[SPEAKER_17]: No, actually, there is a pretty good DDR community in New York, and I found this out after, you know, having to keep an eye on the New York thread for a while.

990
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:53,972
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I've actually seen a few of the people from New York play, at least in videos and things, and there's a pretty good crowd there, so I'd really look forward to seeing that.

991
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:56,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't somebody from here playing out there?

992
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:58,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that happening?

993
01:07:59,355 --> 01:07:59,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, what?

994
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was DJ 8-Ball that was going up there.

995
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they going to have to letterbox Ezekiel?

996
01:08:06,106 --> 01:08:07,227
[SPEAKER_17]: No comment.

997
01:08:08,347 --> 01:08:10,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, was that my outside voice?

998
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:11,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

999
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1000
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:13,731
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not nice.

1001
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:17,514
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a nice, friendly radio station, goddammit.

1002
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:19,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Aren't we?

1003
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,637
[SPEAKER_12]: We're fucking wonderful people.

1004
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,520
[SPEAKER_12]: We're nice, caring, wonderful, goddamned people.

1005
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:26,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And you love us.

1006
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Worship us.

1007
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:31,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Lab says Nobody Jen will be there.

1008
01:08:32,912 --> 01:08:34,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, she's a member of RTF.

1009
01:08:35,355 --> 01:08:37,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't met her, but I've heard very good things about her.

1010
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:37,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1011
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1012
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:49,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Except there's parts of her... I'm not going to comment on that, because I commented on that when we made suggestions for what would be scored on in the Shaft tourney.

1013
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:50,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1014
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:54,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, but... And she's really good for freestyle.

1015
01:08:55,376 --> 01:08:58,879
[SPEAKER_17]: But how is it going to score you points with judges by grabbing your boobs?

1016
01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:00,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1017
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,521
[SPEAKER_17]: As part of her routine.

1018
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:04,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make a comment on that.

1019
01:09:04,262 --> 01:09:04,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

1020
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:06,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me that microphone.

1021
01:09:06,964 --> 01:09:08,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not a host.

1022
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:09,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the microphone.

1023
01:09:09,246 --> 01:09:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That heavily weighs on score, I believe, man.

1024
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:15,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Grabbing one's boob is not a show of talent.

1025
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:20,033
[SPEAKER_03]: If I grab my boob in the middle of a freestyle routine, will you give me a hundred...

1026
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:23,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I said it didn't count for you.

1027
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:26,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It might count against you, but I said it scores heavily.

1028
01:09:27,978 --> 01:09:28,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending.

1029
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1030
01:09:29,638 --> 01:09:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: What if my boobs aren't very heavily?

1031
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:37,120
[SPEAKER_17]: A person should be judged on how well they perform not grabbing your boob.

1032
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's performance.

1033
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, maybe in a strip club.

1034
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:47,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, like, all the cheerleaders on the NFL teams and all the professional sports teams would get fired.

1035
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if you grab your boobs on mirror mode?

1036
01:09:50,123 --> 01:09:50,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're really fucked.

1037
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:55,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember the whole mirror thing?

1038
01:09:57,646 --> 01:10:01,209
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I believe that was a year ago today was SCAT.

1039
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:02,650
[SPEAKER_03]: October 27th, right?

1040
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it was.

1041
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a year ago today.

1042
01:10:04,391 --> 01:10:07,794
[SPEAKER_17]: We were having our show on the anniversary of...

1043
01:10:08,965 --> 01:10:13,426
[SPEAKER_17]: The Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament, where we had four people cosplay.

1044
01:10:14,286 --> 01:10:15,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were all very good.

1045
01:10:15,686 --> 01:10:19,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we had Ryan running around in his Afronova costume.

1046
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:21,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was funny because Ryan didn't even try to enter.

1047
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:24,608
[SPEAKER_05]: He just happened to dress up like the guy from Afronova.

1048
01:10:24,948 --> 01:10:26,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he's like, hey, wait, cosplay?

1049
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:27,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll enter.

1050
01:10:27,049 --> 01:10:28,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

1051
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:32,650
[SPEAKER_17]: And we had, who else was there?

1052
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Fiona.

1053
01:10:35,288 --> 01:10:39,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Hikaru, who, because we're nice, we're not going to comment on her.

1054
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:41,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, great, cosplay, wonderful.

1055
01:10:41,731 --> 01:10:51,816
[SPEAKER_17]: She had a really nice Milia costume, Milia Rage from Guilty Gear X. We had Jossie in her petite carrot, her puchiko outfit.

1056
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:55,738
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we had, of course, Ryan Zafranova costume.

1057
01:10:56,218 --> 01:11:01,201
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we had Satsuki as Devilzuki, who Travis interviewed.

1058
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:02,770
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

1059
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:18,922
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want sprinkles on mine.

1060
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:20,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Those interviews were hilarious.

1061
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them very bad.

1062
01:11:22,263 --> 01:11:26,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish he would... That's a bummer about him being in Texas, too, is now he can't do our Shaft interviews.

1063
01:11:26,545 --> 01:11:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay, because we're going to have Orange Lounge, hopefully, streaming all day long.

1064
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:30,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1065
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:31,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops!

1066
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:43,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was funny, because I remember he gave, like, a little sex quiz to all the people that he interviewed, except Dr. Hikaru, because he was scared of what she might answer as, like, for some of the answers he gave.

1067
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:44,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.

1068
01:11:47,412 --> 01:11:49,012
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we are not here.

1069
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:52,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, we are nice, goddammit, and we are going to behave.

1070
01:11:52,793 --> 01:11:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: We are fucking wonderful people.

1071
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:55,314
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to behave like degenerates.

1072
01:11:57,594 --> 01:11:58,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Next, please.

1073
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:02,956
[SPEAKER_17]: So, anyway, I guess... Travis wants to know what the hell I'm talking about.

1074
01:12:03,256 --> 01:12:05,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he just heard me say his name and he suddenly woke up.

1075
01:12:05,856 --> 01:12:09,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Since we're on the tournament discussion subject, though... Yes.

1076
01:12:10,437 --> 01:12:16,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone, go to sakbemani.com, click on the link for Shaft...

1077
01:12:18,284 --> 01:12:19,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Go get some Shaft!

1078
01:12:19,224 --> 01:12:20,265
[SPEAKER_17]: My head hurts.

1079
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:20,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, tons of prizes.

1080
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:20,886
[SPEAKER_17]: I...

1081
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:50,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much so that in order to not look strange, you know, leaving work with like box loads of DVDs, I'm going to have to like smuggle them out of my work like one box at a time.

1082
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one box at a time, like 50 DVDs per day.

1083
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:57,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's crazy.

1084
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

1085
01:12:58,324 --> 01:12:59,524
[SPEAKER_03]: He said 50 DVDs per day.

1086
01:12:59,604 --> 01:13:02,647
[SPEAKER_03]: So the door prices at SCAT, or I'm sorry, at Shaft...

1087
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:05,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost everybody's walking home with something.

1088
01:13:05,368 --> 01:13:09,331
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we go to so many tournaments and people are always like, well, the same people always win.

1089
01:13:09,611 --> 01:13:11,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if you show up, everybody's a winner.

1090
01:13:12,613 --> 01:13:13,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Just about.

1091
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:14,894
[SPEAKER_17]: While supplies last.

1092
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,241
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also assuming everything works out properly.

1093
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:22,782
[SPEAKER_17]: We are going to have a demo of DDR Max, the USA one.

1094
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:24,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1095
01:13:24,582 --> 01:13:28,323
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also, you know, we've been having these meetings.

1096
01:13:28,763 --> 01:13:30,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, the tournament is in two weeks.

1097
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:34,945
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having, I've talked to a couple people who are coming from out of state, which is going to be good.

1098
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:36,525
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have a big turnout for this.

1099
01:13:37,925 --> 01:13:41,346
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Scandia has really been wonderful in helping us.

1100
01:13:41,466 --> 01:13:44,547
[SPEAKER_17]: We are having, we're having a bake sale.

1101
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:51,240
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to contribute to the bake sale, bring us your... I'm making arrow cookies for the bake sale.

1102
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,301
[SPEAKER_17]: We need pro cookies, too.

1103
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And afro cookies.

1104
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:54,101
[SPEAKER_17]: We need the afro cookies.

1105
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:59,562
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we have Rice Krispie treats with, you know, little Beat Mania... We're going to have Beat Mania bars.

1106
01:13:59,942 --> 01:14:01,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we'll have Beat Mania bars.

1107
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if anybody wants to be in on the fun, you know, bring us your... We should, like, get pineapple and cut them into arrows, and then we can have some fruity paras.

1108
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:11,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

1109
01:14:11,985 --> 01:14:12,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Ha ha ha ha.

1110
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:14,993
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

1111
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:43,899
[SPEAKER_17]: including the possibility of an orange lounge chair.

1112
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're looking into that.

1113
01:14:45,602 --> 01:14:47,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing if we can get that to happen, an orange lounge chair.

1114
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:49,089
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to make that happen.

1115
01:14:50,631 --> 01:14:59,677
[SPEAKER_17]: But the tournament's going to be big, you know, for any of you who can't afford to fly out from whatever country or potent county you live in, feel free to.

1116
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:01,098
[SPEAKER_17]: We like company.

1117
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:07,521
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take a plane, you can take a train, you can take a bus, you can take a boat, you can walk.

1118
01:15:08,702 --> 01:15:10,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're walking, leave now.

1119
01:15:10,223 --> 01:15:14,626
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you happen to be a paraplegic, you can squirm.

1120
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:21,325
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Morpheus says every 10th person there can get a free bottle of Kaboom

1121
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:38,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Winner!

1122
01:15:40,086 --> 01:15:40,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright!

1123
01:15:40,726 --> 01:15:41,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaboom!

1124
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:42,186
[SPEAKER_12]: The new orange!

1125
01:15:43,307 --> 01:15:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm going to put that in the orange.

1126
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:45,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the idea.

1127
01:15:45,227 --> 01:15:46,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the idea.

1128
01:15:46,068 --> 01:15:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put some kaboom in the back.

1129
01:15:47,188 --> 01:15:51,229
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to get little red bouncy balls and give them out as happy fun ball.

1130
01:15:51,549 --> 01:15:52,030
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happy.

1131
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:52,690
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fun.

1132
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:53,670
[SPEAKER_17]: It's happy fun ball.

1133
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,591
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to give bouncy balls.

1134
01:15:55,611 --> 01:15:57,251
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to give you balls.

1135
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:00,913
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't even come to the tournament because I say so.

1136
01:16:02,193 --> 01:16:02,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Come or die.

1137
01:16:04,034 --> 01:16:05,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Skate or die!

1138
01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:07,675
[SPEAKER_17]: That's dating you now.

1139
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,521
[SPEAKER_17]: I had my Charo reference.

1140
01:16:11,802 --> 01:16:13,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

1141
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:16,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we come back, what are we going to do?

1142
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:17,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to talk about something else?

1143
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:19,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to do a list list?

1144
01:16:19,566 --> 01:16:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: List list.

1145
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: List list for what?

1146
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:22,388
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll think of something.

1147
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:23,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll think of something.

1148
01:16:23,269 --> 01:16:27,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this might be a long break while we think of what list lists we're going to do.

1149
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,293
[SPEAKER_03]: But a surprise list list when we come back.

1150
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually looking for a song to play.

1152
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:35,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Play something.

1153
01:16:35,976 --> 01:16:36,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything.

1154
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:37,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Kuchaka.

1155
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:41,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have Kachaka, dammit.

1156
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:44,896
[SPEAKER_17]: We are all hopelessly addicted to Kachaka.

1157
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:47,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking for... Even those of us who haven't been able to pass it yet.

1158
01:16:47,278 --> 01:16:48,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for at least 100 seconds.

1159
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find it.

1160
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I said we'd play that this break.

1161
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:51,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.

1162
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:56,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what we can play.

1163
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play the song.

1164
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play something that we played on Friday night's fucked up show.

1165
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not playing Dirty.

1166
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:04,711
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not playing Dirty.

1167
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:06,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll play...

1168
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:10,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have Kataka!

1169
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:13,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play some other shit.

1170
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1171
01:17:51,759 --> 01:17:52,563
Thanks for watching!

1172
01:18:35,892 --> 01:18:36,594
Thanks for watching!

1173
01:19:27,674 --> 01:19:28,336
Thanks for watching!

1174
01:21:23,593 --> 01:21:30,029
Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy Wedding Happy New Year, Happy New Year, I say to you every night

1175
01:22:08,936 --> 01:22:09,656
Thanks for watching!

1176
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:51,930
I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll say to you every day I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting

1177
01:23:09,828 --> 01:23:20,777
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you, everybody I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me

1178
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:36,739
[SPEAKER_10]: When's the next time that we're gonna take out the remote kit and tape some shit?

1179
01:26:47,401 --> 01:26:49,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Shaft, really.

1180
01:26:50,023 --> 01:26:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, if it all goes well, we'll be doing a test next week of this.

1181
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:54,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing the whole day.

1182
01:26:54,846 --> 01:27:01,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge broadcast is going to just broadcast straight from the Scandia Golf Course all day for those of you guys that can't make it.

1183
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,551
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also rebroadcast it for those of you guys that are there.

1184
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear it later.

1185
01:27:05,712 --> 01:27:07,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll rebroadcast it at some point.

1186
01:27:07,653 --> 01:27:08,874
[SPEAKER_17]: At least in bits and pieces.

1187
01:27:08,894 --> 01:27:11,676
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you mean the whole day?

1188
01:27:12,096 --> 01:27:14,177
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be broadcasting the tournament all day.

1189
01:27:14,197 --> 01:27:16,318
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to broadcast the tournament all day long.

1190
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1191
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you meant like just having a normal show next week all day.

1192
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That was weird.

1193
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:31,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And since Jamie and I are going to kind of be busy with tournament stuff, I'm going to be out there doing a lot of the MC stuff, and Jamie's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.

1194
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:32,432
[SPEAKER_17]: We should have junior hosts.

1195
01:27:33,392 --> 01:27:35,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll only be able to get on the stream.

1196
01:27:35,232 --> 01:27:36,032
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call them our cupcakes.

1197
01:27:36,052 --> 01:27:37,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, our cupcakes.

1198
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:43,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Tal will be emceeing some of it, and I'll be in the... Oh, he might be.

1199
01:27:43,654 --> 01:27:44,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on.

1200
01:27:45,074 --> 01:27:45,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1201
01:27:45,674 --> 01:27:48,815
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I'm told, Tal will be doing part of it or something, depending on what's going on.

1202
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:49,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we definitely would appreciate his assistance.

1203
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can get on the stream while that's going on, do some interviews.

1204
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:57,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, we'll probably get Loki on there.

1205
01:27:57,497 --> 01:27:59,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Some familiar faces have been on the show in the past.

1206
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Brad and Irene will be doing some interviews.

1207
01:28:01,578 --> 01:28:02,878
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you hear my face?

1208
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:05,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Some familiar voices, then.

1209
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:06,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1210
01:28:06,999 --> 01:28:08,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be doing all the interviews.

1211
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:08,980
[SPEAKER_17]: The silhouette of my mind.

1212
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:09,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

1213
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,711
[SPEAKER_03]: List List is the best song in a DVR 3rd mix or 3rd Korean machine

1214
01:28:30,654 --> 01:28:38,758
[SPEAKER_17]: and we are basically leaving it at that so that in the future we can have second mix as an option and fourth mix as an option and etc.

1215
01:28:38,838 --> 01:28:42,460
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's start with the most special person in the room, me.

1216
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:55,387
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to contribute to this list, basically we're going to name our top three best third mix stuff and then we'll have a big list and then each one of us gets to remove an unworthy song from the list.

1217
01:28:56,348 --> 01:29:00,356
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the chat room gets to decide on the final list.

1218
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:00,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dave?

1219
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:03,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anyone says Dynamite Rave, they get punched.

1220
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:04,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Punch!

1221
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:06,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't punch!

1222
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:11,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting to give the mic back to Rob.

1223
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:12,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll let Rob start.

1224
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:13,133
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here.

1225
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:14,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have to start?

1226
01:29:14,574 --> 01:29:15,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I said so.

1227
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:17,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess because I never start, huh?

1228
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1229
01:29:18,256 --> 01:29:24,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm also supposed to give a really quick announcement before I, because I'm cleaning out my PM windows and anticipation list list.

1230
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:29,843
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus wants any locals in Sacramento or Bay Area, I guess, to go to Scandia and bring your costumes.

1231
01:29:30,444 --> 01:29:34,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's going to be a contest or anything, but I'm just supposed to give that announcement.

1232
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:37,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a get-together on Halloween.

1233
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:39,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your Halloween DDR on.

1234
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your spooky on.

1235
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:41,691
[SPEAKER_17]: So give us your number three.

1236
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:43,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll go first because I never go first.

1237
01:29:44,632 --> 01:29:51,975
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three choice for best freaking third mix stuff is Flashdance.

1238
01:29:52,895 --> 01:29:54,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Flashdance fucking owns.

1239
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:55,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it does.

1240
01:29:55,496 --> 01:29:58,177
[SPEAKER_17]: It was one of the first songs I ever played on the actual third mix machine.

1241
01:29:58,197 --> 01:29:58,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave.

1242
01:29:59,378 --> 01:29:59,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Dave.

1243
01:30:01,067 --> 01:30:05,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I was going to say that that was my first song that I did on double.

1244
01:30:06,409 --> 01:30:08,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a four, actually, but I failed.

1245
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay, um... Actually, I failed the first time I ever played it.

1246
01:30:11,651 --> 01:30:11,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1247
01:30:12,672 --> 01:30:13,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this is tough.

1248
01:30:13,772 --> 01:30:14,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got, like, six choices.

1249
01:30:15,393 --> 01:30:18,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll go with the Boom Boom Dollar KOG mix.

1250
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:19,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1251
01:30:19,934 --> 01:30:20,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's cool.

1252
01:30:21,355 --> 01:30:23,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And the trick one is really cool.

1253
01:30:23,636 --> 01:30:24,096
[SPEAKER_04]: KOG.

1254
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:25,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1255
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:28,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Oh, sorry, KOG's...

1256
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fucking deal.

1257
01:30:31,942 --> 01:30:32,302
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1258
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:34,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Loki, your number three choice.

1259
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:36,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be Do It All Night.

1260
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:38,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Do It All Night!

1261
01:30:38,406 --> 01:30:38,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1262
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you put that on your list, because I didn't.

1263
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:46,693
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three... Save the best for last.

1264
01:30:46,753 --> 01:30:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies last.

1265
01:30:48,154 --> 01:30:48,614
[SPEAKER_17]: ...is Face.

1266
01:30:49,134 --> 01:30:49,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Face.

1267
01:30:51,856 --> 01:30:52,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome song.

1268
01:30:52,937 --> 01:30:54,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Face is pretty fucking cool.

1269
01:30:54,518 --> 01:30:54,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1270
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick for best song on a third mix machine, If You Can Say Goodbye.

1271
01:31:00,543 --> 01:31:01,304
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a good song.

1272
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:02,104
[SPEAKER_17]: I love that song.

1273
01:31:04,386 --> 01:31:07,287
[SPEAKER_17]: If You Can Say Goodbye.

1274
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:08,828
[SPEAKER_17]: But the song is freaking amazing.

1275
01:31:08,848 --> 01:31:09,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The song's freaking rad.

1276
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:10,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Your turn.

1277
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one that most people forget about, but it owns.

1278
01:31:13,611 --> 01:31:20,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my second choice is Song Suck, because I love the little thing in the middle.

1279
01:31:20,536 --> 01:31:21,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Song Suck, Song Sucks.

1280
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:22,577
Wow.

1281
01:31:25,549 --> 01:31:26,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Loki.

1282
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,471
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can forget this.

1283
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Afronova.

1284
01:31:31,232 --> 01:31:32,312
Afronova.

1285
01:31:35,493 --> 01:31:36,674
[SPEAKER_19]: The song is fucking gay.

1286
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:39,635
[SPEAKER_19]: The song is fucking gay.

1287
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:41,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Caution.

1288
01:31:41,636 --> 01:31:42,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Caution.

1289
01:31:43,857 --> 01:31:50,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because I can sit and listen to that song on repeat for a full hour and not even realize it.

1290
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Caution.

1291
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people know it as caution.

1292
01:31:52,941 --> 01:31:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one choice...

1293
01:31:55,615 --> 01:31:56,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Drumroll please.

1294
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:57,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Drumroll please.

1295
01:31:57,256 --> 01:31:57,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

1296
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you all know this by now.

1297
01:31:59,516 --> 01:32:02,617
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

1298
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:03,698
[SPEAKER_03]: That song owns.

1299
01:32:05,498 --> 01:32:07,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, because Rob is our erotic whore.

1300
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:08,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking love that song.

1301
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:09,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1302
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the song that really got me hooked on DDR.

1303
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:13,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So give it it's credit please.

1304
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:14,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially with karaoke mode.

1305
01:32:16,122 --> 01:32:16,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1306
01:32:16,882 --> 01:32:18,663
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one choice is Beautiful 21C.

1307
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that song owns.

1308
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:20,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta gotta ooh.

1309
01:32:20,804 --> 01:32:21,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1310
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:21,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Gotta gotta hot too.

1311
01:32:22,802 --> 01:32:23,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, beautiful.

1312
01:32:24,023 --> 01:32:26,765
[SPEAKER_17]: See, he stole one of mine, so I'm going to let him have it, though.

1313
01:32:28,486 --> 01:32:29,067
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you can have it.

1314
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your number one pick.

1315
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:39,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is probably going to get a lot of flack for this, but this is the song that I've learned on one of the songs other than Pink Dinosaur.

1316
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that song, okay?

1317
01:32:43,437 --> 01:32:44,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's La Senorita.

1318
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:45,979
[SPEAKER_04]: La Senorita!

1319
01:32:49,332 --> 01:32:52,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, my number one pick is... Number one pick.

1320
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:54,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Gentle Stress, AMD, whatever.

1321
01:32:54,937 --> 01:32:55,017
[SPEAKER_17]: WHAT?

1322
01:32:55,037 --> 01:32:55,938
[SPEAKER_19]: NOT LET THEM MOVE!

1323
01:32:56,959 --> 01:32:57,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Why me?

1324
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:02,964
[SPEAKER_17]: That would have been voted off really fast.

1325
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:04,905
[SPEAKER_17]: He's talking about putting... let them know.

1326
01:33:05,806 --> 01:33:09,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Black Lab is bitching and moaning because we didn't put Get Up and Dance on there.

1327
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: For a reason!

1328
01:33:11,191 --> 01:33:13,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that, but I knew it would get voted off.

1329
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the background is fucking rad.

1330
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:17,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We already found that out.

1331
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:21,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that was the number one background voted in a previous episode.

1332
01:33:21,564 --> 01:33:23,586
[SPEAKER_03]: But the song sucks.

1333
01:33:23,826 --> 01:33:24,367
[SPEAKER_17]: It's booty.

1334
01:33:25,547 --> 01:33:25,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob.

1335
01:33:26,108 --> 01:33:26,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume 4.

1336
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,092
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it only takes a minute to get good.

1337
01:33:31,832 --> 01:33:33,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, what were you saying about that?

1338
01:33:33,694 --> 01:33:34,274
[SPEAKER_14]: It was booty.

1339
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:35,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Booty.

1340
01:33:42,879 --> 01:33:44,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, so let me read off the list.

1341
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you may.

1342
01:33:45,841 --> 01:33:48,283
[SPEAKER_17]: We have, we're starting, and don't forget to copy to the chat room.

1343
01:33:48,423 --> 01:33:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have to eliminate.

1344
01:33:50,045 --> 01:33:50,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, oh yeah.

1345
01:33:52,993 --> 01:34:13,756
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm voting on Flashdance, Boom Boom, Dollar, KOGG3, Do It All Night, Face, If You Can Say Goodbye, Soong Sook, Afronova, Caution, Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful21C, La Señorita, Gentle Stress, AMD, Sexual Mix, Crap, Whatever What did you forget, Dave?

1346
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:17,554
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1347
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly enough, I'm not going to go with the one that you'd think I'd vote off.

1348
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:38,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to take out Boom Boom Dollar, the KOG mix, because I'm sorry, the remix sucks.

1349
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,665
[SPEAKER_03]: The steps suck.

1350
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:43,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The original owns, but the remix sucks.

1351
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:46,527
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember having an asthma attack on that song.

1352
01:34:46,867 --> 01:34:48,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck KOG.

1353
01:34:49,008 --> 01:34:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for Rhythm and Police.

1354
01:34:49,908 --> 01:34:51,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the hardest trick song ever.

1355
01:34:51,849 --> 01:34:52,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1356
01:34:52,489 --> 01:34:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave.

1357
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:53,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

1358
01:34:55,251 --> 01:34:56,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I will take off.

1359
01:34:58,303 --> 01:34:59,444
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can save, goodbye.

1360
01:34:59,864 --> 01:35:00,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, asshole.

1361
01:35:01,284 --> 01:35:01,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Bitch.

1362
01:35:03,185 --> 01:35:03,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Burn in hell.

1363
01:35:04,926 --> 01:35:05,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Loki.

1364
01:35:06,546 --> 01:35:07,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, Travis.

1365
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:13,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge fan of these Korean songs, which is why I don't miss them.

1366
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,151
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to have to say goodbye to SungSuk.

1367
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1368
01:35:19,512 --> 01:35:20,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is my friend.

1369
01:35:25,034 --> 01:35:27,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Leaving me with horrible choices left to make?

1370
01:35:28,908 --> 01:35:30,711
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to eliminate one of these songs.

1371
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,795
[SPEAKER_17]: I fucking love playing all of these songs.

1372
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:41,851
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two that I'm floating back and forth and unfortunately they're both ones that Loki picked.

1373
01:35:44,028 --> 01:35:46,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take off Afronova.

1374
01:35:46,309 --> 01:35:47,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, taking off Afronova.

1375
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:48,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm pissed off at that song.

1376
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:51,951
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's for personal, you know, bitchy reasons.

1377
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:53,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Total personal vengeance.

1378
01:35:54,072 --> 01:35:54,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1379
01:35:54,912 --> 01:35:59,694
[SPEAKER_17]: So our list is, as soon as we have it posted to the chat room.

1380
01:36:01,815 --> 01:36:13,106
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Señorita, and Gentle Stress, AMD's Sexual Mix.

1381
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:14,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1382
01:36:14,748 --> 01:36:20,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you guys vote, we're going to take a minute and we're going to play one of those songs that totally got neglected from our list.

1383
01:36:21,548 --> 01:36:22,788
[SPEAKER_03]: and why you guys vote from it.

1384
01:36:22,888 --> 01:36:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all Dave's fault, too, by the way.

1385
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to play the full version of it.

1386
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:28,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can send in your votes.

1387
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got three minutes to do it.

1388
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:33,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to read the list when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1389
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:35,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Make sure to send your votes in private message.

1390
01:36:35,552 --> 01:36:39,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Votes must be over private message to Sky in the chat room or they don't count.

1391
01:36:40,014 --> 01:36:41,054
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll stick the ferret on you.

1392
01:39:56,409 --> 01:39:59,011
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can say goodbye, baby

1393
01:41:32,697 --> 01:41:33,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch, get a new song.

1394
01:41:34,717 --> 01:41:37,178
[SPEAKER_01]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1395
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we've just been doing a little listless segment on the, what are we calling this, the best third mix or third Korean ever, right?

1396
01:42:10,984 --> 01:42:14,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is listless third mix Korean.

1397
01:42:14,247 --> 01:42:15,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes.

1398
01:42:15,589 --> 01:42:16,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So, without...

1399
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:22,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Further ado, let me read you what the list was that we had to pick from here.

1400
01:42:22,902 --> 01:42:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Senorita, and Gentle Stress AMD.

1401
01:42:31,984 --> 01:42:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, I reveal the results to you.

1402
01:42:35,704 --> 01:42:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, will you please tell them what the number three song was?

1403
01:42:38,905 --> 01:42:39,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Frashdance!

1404
01:42:40,385 --> 01:42:41,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Frashdance, yay!

1405
01:42:41,946 --> 01:42:43,386
[SPEAKER_17]: A very good song!

1406
01:42:44,642 --> 01:42:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: and the second place winner, Jamie.

1407
01:42:46,983 --> 01:42:47,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Gentle Stress.

1408
01:42:47,943 --> 01:42:48,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay!

1409
01:42:48,504 --> 01:42:49,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had good taste.

1410
01:42:49,284 --> 01:42:50,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Gentle Stress.

1411
01:42:51,305 --> 01:42:56,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number one song by an overwhelming margin, might I add, was, Jamie?

1412
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:57,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Do it on that.

1413
01:43:00,376 --> 01:43:00,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1414
01:43:01,097 --> 01:43:03,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Do It All Night wins the... Oh my god, Do It All Night wins!

1415
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Bestest third Korean song ever.

1416
01:43:07,202 --> 01:43:08,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, I don't have bad taste.

1417
01:43:08,864 --> 01:43:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just everyone in the chat room who didn't vote for Beautiful 21C, because that song owns.

1418
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:14,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.

1419
01:43:15,069 --> 01:43:17,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And Beautiful 21C, by the way, got no votes.

1420
01:43:18,633 --> 01:43:19,514
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what we should do?

1421
01:43:19,874 --> 01:43:20,094
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1422
01:43:20,174 --> 01:43:21,736
[SPEAKER_17]: We should play that during one of our next breaks.

1423
01:43:21,976 --> 01:43:22,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1424
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: There are going to be no next breaks.

1425
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,181
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll play during the afterbirth.

1426
01:43:25,281 --> 01:43:26,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do it afterbirth or after the show.

1427
01:43:27,143 --> 01:43:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing I should add, by the way.

1428
01:43:29,666 --> 01:43:33,710
[SPEAKER_03]: In effect, to keep you people listening to the station, we're not going to drop listeners after the show anymore.

1429
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go right into music when the show's done.

1430
01:43:35,892 --> 01:43:41,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can stay tuned and hear random shit from Bomani and maybe more.

1431
01:43:41,578 --> 01:43:41,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

1432
01:43:42,992 --> 01:43:43,773
[SPEAKER_14]: It's bootylicious.

1433
01:43:43,993 --> 01:43:47,495
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't shut up about that baseball game in the chatroom.

1434
01:43:47,655 --> 01:43:47,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Booty.

1435
01:43:47,895 --> 01:43:48,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Booty.

1436
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the Angels won, it sounds like.

1437
01:43:50,237 --> 01:43:50,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

1438
01:43:51,398 --> 01:43:51,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1439
01:43:52,218 --> 01:43:53,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm falling asleep on the watch here.

1440
01:43:53,499 --> 01:43:53,840
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1441
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,281
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1442
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,502
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my baby mama.

1443
01:44:02,586 --> 01:44:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The chatroom's begging me to play the legend.

1444
01:44:06,008 --> 01:44:06,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Screw them.

1445
01:44:08,226 --> 01:44:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Afterbirth Afterbirth, okay, we'll do the legend in the Afterbirth We're never playing that fucking other song again No, we're not gonna play Dirty What?

1446
01:44:16,289 --> 01:44:29,033
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're emceeing at Shaft, we need to still do the rave thing That'd be hilarious Except we're gonna get the biggest, like, you faggots look from the crowd But that's okay You got a problem with that?

1447
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:32,494
[SPEAKER_17]: You can bite my big toe That's right

1448
01:44:33,573 --> 01:44:37,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie was teasing the idea earlier that we ought to take this show to three hours.

1449
01:44:37,675 --> 01:44:38,475
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

1450
01:44:38,495 --> 01:44:39,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Chat room, let us know.

1451
01:44:39,296 --> 01:44:39,736
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think?

1452
01:44:39,796 --> 01:44:40,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Three hours or what?

1453
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:43,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Or send us your comments over email, orangelounge, radio, yahoo.com.

1454
01:44:44,058 --> 01:44:47,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that if we do three hours, then the last hour is going to be all afterbirth.

1455
01:44:47,799 --> 01:44:49,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to get really random.

1456
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We might start expanding into other types of video game things, like video game reviews.

1457
01:44:54,122 --> 01:45:02,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since Under Sedation Live is off air in Sacramento, we can kind of roll over to something more like that show for the last hour.

1458
01:45:03,499 --> 01:45:04,379
[SPEAKER_17]: That could be quite possible.

1459
01:45:04,839 --> 01:45:05,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Possibility.

1460
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to steal, but... One big nerd fest.

1461
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: One big nerd fest.

1462
01:45:09,841 --> 01:45:10,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1463
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:13,441
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, do anime reviews, or we can have the random reviews.

1464
01:45:13,461 --> 01:45:15,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Like my review of Contra Shattered Soldier.

1465
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:16,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1466
01:45:16,702 --> 01:45:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I probably wouldn't be able to stay until 10, because I need to have a ride right now.

1467
01:45:20,343 --> 01:45:22,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because you're... I don't have a license.

1468
01:45:22,644 --> 01:45:24,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Be the overage part of the show.

1469
01:45:24,924 --> 01:45:25,464
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal part.

1470
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:27,925
[SPEAKER_17]: That's when we all get drunk and smoke crack.

1471
01:45:28,345 --> 01:45:31,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in four months, I'll be right here, and I'll stay the whole time.

1472
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:32,766
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got to bring your own pipe.

1473
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:35,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Your own crack fight?

1474
01:45:35,229 --> 01:45:37,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because we smoke crack when you leave.

1475
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:48,959
[SPEAKER_03]: That was something else I was thinking about bringing to a... No, no, not smoking crack, but bringing to Shaft was getting some sugar crystals and selling crack at the bake sale.

1476
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,141
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would just be sugar crystals, but I say crack rocks.

1477
01:45:51,161 --> 01:45:51,882
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be funny.

1478
01:45:53,696 --> 01:45:54,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge crack.

1479
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:58,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, we're working on the phone call thing, so please stop begging.

1480
01:45:58,765 --> 01:45:59,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.

1481
01:46:00,848 --> 01:46:01,790
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on the phone calls.

1482
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be able to take those soon.

1483
01:46:03,272 --> 01:46:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got the new website coming.

1484
01:46:04,694 --> 01:46:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a whole new season of Orange Lounge Radio before you know it.

1485
01:46:08,482 --> 01:46:09,202
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be like Buffy.

1486
01:46:09,242 --> 01:46:10,062
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go on forever and ever.

1487
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:10,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be like Buffy.

1488
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:12,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll kill off Jamie.

1489
01:46:13,123 --> 01:46:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1490
01:46:14,004 --> 01:46:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And then bring her back to life and introduce her sister she never knew about.

1491
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:23,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, made from my genetic material and soul or something, and she's the next Slayer.

1492
01:46:24,367 --> 01:46:26,407
[SPEAKER_17]: And then James Marshall is a nice vampire.

1493
01:46:27,307 --> 01:46:28,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Spike's hot.

1494
01:46:30,148 --> 01:46:31,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So what exactly would that be like?

1495
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:34,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Slightly darker shade of hue Sakura?

1496
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1497
01:46:36,912 --> 01:46:37,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Grey Sakura.

1498
01:46:38,214 --> 01:46:41,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, no, I'll be like, like, you know, Blacklight Sakura.

1499
01:46:41,918 --> 01:46:42,419
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll glow.

1500
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,601
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be Rave Sakura.

1501
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:47,344
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a hug.

1502
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me give you my shingoku.

1503
01:46:48,466 --> 01:46:50,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Or better yet, you'll be Booty Sakura.

1504
01:46:50,248 --> 01:46:50,728
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1505
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:54,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me give you my shingoku satsu of love.

1506
01:46:56,755 --> 01:46:57,235
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.

1507
01:46:57,255 --> 01:47:01,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got ten minutes left in the show.

1508
01:47:01,317 --> 01:47:02,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Time for all fools to be dead.

1509
01:47:02,597 --> 01:47:03,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Time for you to get a watch.

1510
01:47:03,358 --> 01:47:04,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Time for you to shut up.

1511
01:47:04,658 --> 01:47:04,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1512
01:47:05,298 --> 01:47:06,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Get a watch, slacker.

1513
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:09,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1514
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I have anything else on the schedule for tonight?

1515
01:47:12,421 --> 01:47:12,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1516
01:47:13,281 --> 01:47:13,561
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1517
01:47:14,162 --> 01:47:16,983
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to sit and talk about shit for the next five minutes.

1518
01:47:17,003 --> 01:47:18,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys hear the fake Legend of Max MP3?

1519
01:47:18,783 --> 01:47:18,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1520
01:47:18,863 --> 01:47:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1521
01:47:21,032 --> 01:47:21,872
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to hear the fake one?

1522
01:47:21,952 --> 01:47:22,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we have the fake one.

1523
01:47:22,873 --> 01:47:24,574
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to play the fake Legend of Max.

1524
01:47:24,594 --> 01:47:29,556
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn you people that keep trying to spread fake news about Legend of Max.

1525
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Max on whatever the fuck they're calling it.

1526
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:34,098
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme, that's what it's called.

1527
01:47:34,358 --> 01:47:35,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wanted to hear it the other day.

1528
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was fake to begin with, but I still wanted to hear what Corey came up with.

1529
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

1530
01:47:42,702 --> 01:47:46,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have actually deleted it just because I was like, what the fuck?

1531
01:47:46,804 --> 01:47:47,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one seemed to have it.

1532
01:47:47,785 --> 01:47:49,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't sound anything like Max.

1533
01:47:49,165 --> 01:47:50,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe anybody bought it.

1534
01:47:51,235 --> 01:47:55,378
[SPEAKER_17]: We just have to congratulate Cory on his fun hope.

1535
01:47:55,438 --> 01:47:56,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have it.

1536
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:58,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh.

1537
01:47:58,980 --> 01:47:59,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

1538
01:47:59,861 --> 01:48:00,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving up hope yet.

1539
01:48:00,882 --> 01:48:03,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't all send it to me in the chatroom yet or anything.

1540
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:06,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, chatroom, don't send it all to him.

1541
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:07,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here it is.

1542
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:08,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it.

1543
01:48:08,367 --> 01:48:08,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1544
01:48:09,327 --> 01:48:10,088
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fake.

1545
01:48:10,848 --> 01:48:15,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what the hell this really is, but this is what they tried to pass off to you as the Legend of Maxx.

1546
01:48:26,716 --> 01:48:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a big techno-industrial... I feel like raving!

1547
01:48:29,758 --> 01:48:30,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me a hug!

1548
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:31,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1549
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:33,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds happy hardcore.

1550
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:38,763
[SPEAKER_16]: When I get an envelope full of light powder, my first impression is... Just snort it!

1551
01:48:44,346 --> 01:48:45,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even if it isn't... GONG!

1552
01:48:46,768 --> 01:48:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so Asian!

1553
01:48:48,008 --> 01:48:48,529
[SPEAKER_04]: GONG!

1554
01:48:49,769 --> 01:48:51,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it isn't Legend of Max, it's pretty awesome.

1555
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:52,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this song.

1556
01:48:54,429 --> 01:48:55,829
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like taking my SATs.

1557
01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:57,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Gong!

1558
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells like dog!

1559
01:49:03,291 --> 01:49:04,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I actually never took the SATs.

1560
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:06,651
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most repetitive fucking song I've ever heard.

1561
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:07,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, stop it.

1562
01:49:09,232 --> 01:49:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

1563
01:49:09,932 --> 01:49:10,832
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your freeze arrow.

1564
01:49:11,032 --> 01:49:11,732
[SPEAKER_03]: The big gong.

1565
01:49:12,052 --> 01:49:12,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Gong!

1566
01:49:16,773 --> 01:49:20,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have your... It ain't over till the fat lady sings, bitch!

1567
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:22,734
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the opera singer.

1568
01:49:26,383 --> 01:49:31,608
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, actually, sadly enough, I want to take this MP3 and make a DWI4, even though it is fake.

1569
01:49:31,768 --> 01:49:32,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit.

1570
01:49:33,309 --> 01:49:35,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it... More repetitive than Sandstorm, though.

1571
01:49:35,711 --> 01:49:39,395
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the D.Va from The Fifth Element.

1572
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakura sounds more like Max than this does.

1573
01:49:44,421 --> 01:49:48,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hell, I'd rather have it sound like that.

1574
01:49:48,803 --> 01:49:54,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to be honest, I'm kind of sick of Max and Max Unlimited and all the regurgitations of Max.

1575
01:49:54,905 --> 01:49:58,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been a nice change for sure.

1576
01:49:58,747 --> 01:49:59,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1577
01:50:00,508 --> 01:50:05,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of MP3s that are probably fake, Pyro sent this to me before the show.

1578
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,410
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know what that means.

1579
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:13,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposedly Graduation by B4U, but Lord knows what we're actually going to get when I double-click on this file.

1580
01:50:13,485 --> 01:50:16,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Pyroman is our resident prankster in the chatroom.

1581
01:50:16,949 --> 01:50:19,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So this could be a bunch of four-letter dirty words.

1582
01:50:19,732 --> 01:50:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be the Spice Network, for all I know.

1583
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:24,837
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be like a four-minute fart.

1584
01:50:26,418 --> 01:50:29,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Which would be not too far from what an actual B4U song would sound like.

1585
01:50:30,959 --> 01:50:32,100
[SPEAKER_17]: True.

1586
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I made a pun.

1587
01:50:34,521 --> 01:50:35,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see what it is.

1588
01:50:35,482 --> 01:50:37,763
[SPEAKER_03]: This is supposedly Graduation by B4U.

1589
01:50:44,767 --> 01:50:46,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the back singing indicates it's B4U.

1590
01:50:46,328 --> 01:50:49,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this really is it.

1591
01:50:56,073 --> 01:50:56,673
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what it is?

1592
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:58,014
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's Dive Backwards.

1593
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:11,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope, this is actually Japanese.

1594
01:51:14,285 --> 01:51:16,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's trying to see if she can hear the lyrics.

1595
01:51:26,437 --> 01:51:29,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, this is probably just True or Die played backwards.

1596
01:51:29,661 --> 01:51:30,121
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not...

1597
01:51:45,553 --> 01:51:46,073
[SPEAKER_17]: This is legit.

1598
01:51:47,174 --> 01:51:47,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1599
01:51:47,494 --> 01:51:48,215
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they saying?

1600
01:51:49,075 --> 01:51:51,496
[SPEAKER_17]: I only know or understood like five words of it.

1601
01:51:51,876 --> 01:51:55,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately the vocals are a little bit too low for me to hear over the music with as stuck up as my head is.

1602
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:56,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, who knows?

1603
01:52:14,762 --> 01:52:20,385
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1604
01:52:40,444 --> 01:52:42,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Now what if it was from like a single or something like that?

1605
01:52:43,386 --> 01:52:43,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1606
01:52:44,207 --> 01:52:44,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That could possibly be.

1607
01:52:45,808 --> 01:52:48,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so maybe that was graduation, maybe it wasn't.

1608
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't know anymore because there's too many damn people out there spreading fake fakers.

1609
01:52:51,993 --> 01:52:53,554
[SPEAKER_17]: At any rate, it was not a beefy show backwards.

1610
01:52:56,076 --> 01:52:57,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually heard a few real words.

1611
01:52:58,718 --> 01:52:59,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1612
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You missed the voting by about like 10 minutes.

1613
01:53:04,322 --> 01:53:04,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was that?

1614
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:06,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 23rd Magus.

1615
01:53:06,464 --> 01:53:07,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

1616
01:53:07,224 --> 01:53:07,985
[SPEAKER_17]: What did he vote for?

1617
01:53:08,025 --> 01:53:09,086
[SPEAKER_03]: He voted for Los Inuerito.

1618
01:53:10,094 --> 01:53:10,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Oops!

1619
01:53:12,236 --> 01:53:14,718
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't have made her break any ties, so no worries.

1620
01:53:15,919 --> 01:53:17,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe that survived the list anyway.

1621
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:18,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have knocked that one out.

1622
01:53:18,641 --> 01:53:19,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1623
01:53:19,962 --> 01:53:22,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I wasn't going to vote it off because it sounds like Ray Martin.

1624
01:53:23,065 --> 01:53:27,408
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing is, La Senorita in Trick is fun.

1625
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:27,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1626
01:53:28,109 --> 01:53:29,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the little skip moves.

1627
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:31,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that jump and you can jump.

1628
01:53:32,212 --> 01:53:33,573
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite newbie move?

1629
01:53:34,113 --> 01:53:35,134
[SPEAKER_17]: My favorite newbie move?

1630
01:53:35,855 --> 01:53:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those La Senorita skips are my favorite newbie move.

1631
01:53:37,937 --> 01:53:39,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or the clapping in Macquah.

1632
01:53:40,482 --> 01:53:50,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I would probably have to say that my favorite is actually, and this is a move that I was doing two years ago, my very ever first routine was the butterfly spin.

1633
01:53:51,445 --> 01:53:52,565
[SPEAKER_17]: The butterfly bounce jump.

1634
01:53:53,686 --> 01:54:06,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, you know what I'm talking about, where you have your two jumps, you stomp on, alright, for people who remember the steps for butterfly basic, you've got right foot step, jump, and then you turn around and jump the other way.

1635
01:54:07,009 --> 01:54:09,354
[SPEAKER_17]: but you bounce before you do it and I think it kind of looks neat.

1636
01:54:09,654 --> 01:54:17,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And my other favorite one is the spins on Love To Me where they're like down, up, jump, and then down, up, jump again and you do the spins on them.

1637
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:18,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Those look cool.

1638
01:54:19,765 --> 01:54:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if this is considered a newbie freestyle move or not, but I love the caution drop.

1639
01:54:25,308 --> 01:54:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so fun.

1640
01:54:25,968 --> 01:54:27,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the caution drop too.

1641
01:54:27,449 --> 01:54:29,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really tall, so it's really hard.

1642
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:30,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun.

1643
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:35,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's considered a newbie move or just an 18 freestyle type move or what.

1644
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:37,853
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to be damn precise to make it look good though.

1645
01:54:38,113 --> 01:54:41,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like only a little bee can pull it off well.

1646
01:54:43,769 --> 01:54:47,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do the knee drop on End of the Century.

1647
01:54:47,612 --> 01:54:48,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was all cool.

1648
01:54:48,232 --> 01:54:48,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I... I... I...

1649
01:55:03,673 --> 01:55:12,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I still do knee drops now, like for my one edit for Ecstasy where it freezes on a knee drop in the center two arrows on doubles.

1650
01:55:12,919 --> 01:55:15,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped doing that because it bruises my knees very badly.

1651
01:55:15,961 --> 01:55:19,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I still have, okay, this is where I compare scars.

1652
01:55:20,884 --> 01:55:21,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Ab bruise, right there.

1653
01:55:23,405 --> 01:55:26,467
[SPEAKER_04]: For all those who can't see through the radio, she's pointing to her knee.

1654
01:55:27,468 --> 01:55:30,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I have, um... Dude, you have a scar.

1655
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:31,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I do?

1656
01:55:31,410 --> 01:55:31,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1657
01:55:31,741 --> 01:55:38,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's from playing Bakua, my routine, where I scrape my knee because I fell.

1658
01:55:38,543 --> 01:55:42,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I just remember being at Faname last year.

1659
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:52,167
[SPEAKER_17]: In my Emmy costume, my third mix Emmy costume, doing my favorite Kamikaze drop on Love to Me, back when Love to Me was still kind of cool.

1660
01:55:53,187 --> 01:55:58,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Going out into the hall with blood dripping down my leg from landing on a screw on that fourth plus.

1661
01:55:58,932 --> 01:56:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: For Shaps, I could do a rehash of my Dynamite Rave routine where I forget my steps about... Dude, that started off so cool.

1662
01:56:07,499 --> 01:56:08,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifteen seconds into the song.

1663
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,464
[SPEAKER_17]: He pulls off the trench coat and everyone's like, and then he forgets his steps.

1664
01:56:13,484 --> 01:56:15,806
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, crap.

1665
01:56:18,309 --> 01:56:20,790
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so awesome, the beginning of it.

1666
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:21,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the matrix.

1667
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:25,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually, one of the coolest knee drops I've ever seen was also at the same Fonamay.

1668
01:56:25,912 --> 01:56:41,238
[SPEAKER_17]: A guy I know, Chris, did Dynamite Rave, just as one of the characters from Guilty Gear X, and did the corner knee drop, where you step on the up and right, and then knee drop down to the bottom and left.

1669
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:43,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Diagonally, that looks really cool.

1670
01:56:44,352 --> 01:56:48,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I actually have a scar on my leg in the exact same place that Dave has one, but it has nothing to do with DDR.

1671
01:56:48,838 --> 01:56:49,899
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from a game of Truth or Dare.

1672
01:56:51,501 --> 01:56:51,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1673
01:56:52,743 --> 01:56:54,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Stand by to win.

1674
01:56:54,905 --> 01:56:55,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

1675
01:56:55,706 --> 01:56:56,487
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on out there?

1676
01:56:56,868 --> 01:56:57,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

1677
01:56:57,629 --> 01:56:58,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my roommate's on the phone.

1678
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad we can't broadcast it over the air.

1679
01:57:01,253 --> 01:57:01,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1680
01:57:03,021 --> 01:57:04,142
[SPEAKER_14]: This is really good radio.

1681
01:57:04,162 --> 01:57:05,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great radio.

1682
01:57:06,743 --> 01:57:21,392
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I actually, you know, as much as people bitch and complain about it, I miss the old, you know, 18s style moves just because if you do them right, they look so amazing coordinated though.

1683
01:57:21,852 --> 01:57:23,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And true, they're tired routines.

1684
01:57:23,853 --> 01:57:32,058
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I like watching people do like real dance moves on DDR and that's great and I would prefer watching that for different freestyles since I've judged, you know, a few tournaments before.

1685
01:57:32,742 --> 01:57:36,765
[SPEAKER_17]: But the 18 stuff, when done right, is so clean.

1686
01:57:37,505 --> 01:57:38,306
[SPEAKER_17]: And it looks really good.

1687
01:57:39,607 --> 01:57:42,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the Changos do-it-all-night routine.

1688
01:57:42,409 --> 01:57:42,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, no.

1689
01:57:43,109 --> 01:57:43,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

1690
01:57:45,651 --> 01:57:46,571
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't miss him at all.

1691
01:57:47,941 --> 01:57:54,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, was it his Ninzaburra routine, where he was like, what's that guy who brings out the hammer and squash?

1692
01:57:54,543 --> 01:57:55,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's like the Gallagher of PDR.

1693
01:57:55,803 --> 01:57:57,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that routine sucked.

1694
01:57:57,763 --> 01:58:00,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but he squashed a watermelon in the space.

1695
01:58:00,604 --> 01:58:02,324
[SPEAKER_17]: That still sucked.

1696
01:58:03,165 --> 01:58:04,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1697
01:58:04,505 --> 01:58:05,765
[SPEAKER_17]: What was funny about that?

1698
01:58:05,785 --> 01:58:06,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, attention!

1699
01:58:06,726 --> 01:58:07,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, attention!

1700
01:58:07,406 --> 01:58:09,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, I'm a whore, give me attention.

1701
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:09,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

1702
01:58:10,426 --> 01:58:10,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1703
01:58:10,827 --> 01:58:11,947
[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck was funny about that?

1704
01:58:12,687 --> 01:58:13,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1705
01:58:13,827 --> 01:58:14,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1706
01:58:14,787 --> 01:58:16,728
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to smash a watermelon.

1707
01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it was funny, because it was random.

1708
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:21,681
[SPEAKER_17]: It was stupid!

1709
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:23,182
What's the point?

1710
01:58:23,242 --> 01:58:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It was random.

1711
01:58:24,563 --> 01:58:25,523
[SPEAKER_17]: It was still stupid.

1712
01:58:27,284 --> 01:58:28,085
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not funny.

1713
01:58:28,105 --> 01:58:29,626
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not something that wins a tournament.

1714
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:31,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like two heads arguing back and forth.

1715
01:58:31,367 --> 01:58:32,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Random, stupid, random, stupid.

1716
01:58:33,148 --> 01:58:35,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Random is good, but only when it's funny random.

1717
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:38,091
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure he didn't enter trying to win with that routine.

1718
01:58:38,852 --> 01:58:39,852
[SPEAKER_17]: It was still retarded.

1719
01:58:39,912 --> 01:58:42,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of random and stupid, this show is about over.

1720
01:58:43,995 --> 01:58:45,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, he won third.

1721
01:58:47,677 --> 01:58:47,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude...

1722
01:58:49,824 --> 01:58:53,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Just goes to show what lovely judges you can get at a tournament sometimes, right?

1723
01:58:53,607 --> 01:58:55,668
[SPEAKER_17]: It just goes to show people are easily amused.

1724
01:58:55,929 --> 01:58:57,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, we should talk about the movie Jackass.

1725
01:58:58,190 --> 01:58:58,651
[SPEAKER_17]: No!

1726
01:58:58,971 --> 01:59:00,332
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll come up later.

1727
01:59:00,452 --> 01:59:01,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie's not going to go see that.

1728
01:59:01,533 --> 01:59:01,813
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1729
01:59:02,334 --> 01:59:03,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, Jamie.

[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with the cupcakes.

1733
01:59:36,707 --> 01:59:38,148
[SPEAKER_17]: and here's my final thought.

1734
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Impressive.

1735
01:59:45,251 --> 01:59:46,231
[SPEAKER_17]: God, my nose hurts.

1736
01:59:46,671 --> 01:59:49,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is I need a date.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:59:50,853 --> 01:59:51,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Date Rob.

01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:53,951
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

01:59:58,899 --> 01:59:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll love it.

1745
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned.

1746
02:00:00,241 --> 02:00:02,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, one and one does not make two.

1747
02:00:04,087 --> 02:00:06,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be the first song we play coming back.

1748
02:00:07,685 --> 02:00:10,666
[SPEAKER_18]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1749
02:00:11,206 --> 02:00:14,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1750
02:00:15,007 --> 02:00:22,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

1751
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:26,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1752
02:00:34,758 --> 02:00:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

1753
02:00:36,179 --> 02:00:36,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Jill?

1754
02:00:36,979 --> 02:00:37,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Barry.

1755
02:00:37,959 --> 02:00:39,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Why on earth are you here?

1756
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:40,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be examining this.

1757
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:41,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry?

1758
02:00:41,961 --> 02:00:42,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry!

1759
02:00:43,141 --> 02:00:44,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had something I wanted to check.

1760
02:00:45,042 --> 02:00:47,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'll stay and look around more.

1761
02:00:48,944 --> 02:00:49,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa!

1762
02:00:49,864 --> 02:00:50,864
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

1763
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, you're here too?

1764
02:00:52,985 --> 02:00:55,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm beginning to understand.

1765
02:00:55,806 --> 02:00:57,627
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was going to say.

1766
02:00:58,047 --> 02:00:59,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris is our old partner, you know.

1767
02:01:00,788 --> 02:01:02,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're partners, aren't we?

1768
02:01:03,615 --> 02:01:04,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's work together.

1769
02:01:05,036 --> 02:01:06,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this.

1770
02:01:06,616 --> 02:01:07,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1771
02:01:07,457 --> 02:01:07,857
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

1772
02:01:07,877 --> 02:01:08,697
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of it?

1773
02:01:09,098 --> 02:01:10,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Protect yourself.

1774
02:01:10,538 --> 02:01:12,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps that was the most important part.

1775
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.

1776
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll go first.

1777
02:01:15,821 --> 02:01:17,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Sam, it's broken.

1778
02:01:17,582 --> 02:01:18,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems like it.

1779
02:01:19,183 --> 02:01:20,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1780
02:01:20,643 --> 02:01:22,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's going on?

1781
02:01:22,844 --> 02:01:24,085
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, can you do it?

1782
02:01:25,105 --> 02:01:25,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

1783
02:01:25,986 --> 02:01:26,086
Ah!

1784
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:27,947
Ah!

1785
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:28,447
Ah!

1786
02:01:30,048 --> 02:01:30,248
Ah!

1787
02:01:30,508 --> 02:01:31,068
Ah!

1788
02:01:31,329 --> 02:01:31,369
Ah!

1789
02:01:33,143 --> 02:01:34,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Lost courage already?

1790
02:01:34,383 --> 02:01:38,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry for my lack of manners, but I'm not used to escorting men.

1791
02:01:39,705 --> 02:01:40,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Jill!

1792
02:01:40,746 --> 02:01:41,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.

1793
02:01:41,706 --> 02:01:42,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes.

1794
02:01:42,506 --> 02:01:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry!

1795
02:01:43,707 --> 02:01:44,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Dibble sandwich.

1796
02:01:44,987 --> 02:01:45,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1797
02:01:45,588 --> 02:01:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry, don't screw up again.

1798
02:01:47,728 --> 02:01:48,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.

1799
02:01:54,631 --> 02:01:55,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Barry.

1800
02:01:55,771 --> 02:01:56,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

1801
02:01:56,972 --> 02:01:58,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a meeting room or something?

1802
02:01:58,732 --> 02:01:59,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that you, Rebecca?

1803
02:01:59,553 --> 02:01:59,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1804
02:01:59,893 --> 02:02:00,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1805
02:02:00,754 --> 02:02:02,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Rebecca, can you do it?

1806
02:02:02,535 --> 02:02:03,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I can!

1807
02:02:04,116 --> 02:02:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: May I practice for a while?

1808
02:02:05,597 --> 02:02:05,917
[SPEAKER_09]: See?

1809
02:02:06,578 --> 02:02:08,299
