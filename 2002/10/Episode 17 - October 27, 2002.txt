The videotape!
Put it in!
Put it in!
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.
Our live talk program begins now.
Boring!
This video sucks!
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Hide Orange Lounge radio from the fucking children.
The last Metroid is in captivity.
The galaxy is at peace.
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.
One, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 17 for... You okay there?
You need some NyQuil there?
This is episode number 17 for October the 27th of 2002.
You need some Robitussin.
Robitussin!
I almost said that on the pre-show list, except I don't have an editor to cut out all the talk and get me in.
You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most shine-get radio station of all things Bomani.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
You know her better as DarkSakura.
Are you talking, like, out of a box?
Are you talking like the dying man?
No.
Jamie is recovering from ickiness.
We have a whole studio filled with guests.
Let's say hello to our guests.
Actually, they're not even really guests anymore.
They're just, they're always here.
They're the back legs of the show.
They're our mascot.
They're our dancing girls.
They sit behind us.
They're the back legs of the show.
Say hello to Loki.
Loki.
I'm the uncredited member of the show.
You're the guy behind the curtain.
Exactly.
Do not stare behind the curtain.
Nothing to see here.
Move along.
And also Dave.
Say hello to Dave.
I'm just a guy.
I'm just a guy.
What?
You know that No Doubt song, I'm Just a Girl?
No.
Maybe he really is just a girl.
It's one of those evenings.
Sorry, Dave.
We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break with some songs that we want to play for you.
We have to take the children out for a walk.
Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?
I'm mad at you.
I have never heard you crack that high of an octave.
I am mighty impressed.
I have a pretty impressive range, but I keep singing.
I was a fan.
You should go kick Paula Terry's ass.
You could sing.
I was a fan.
You could sing Dive.
I will just take my saxophone and beat her up.
Jamie, I want a Jamie mix of Dive.
There is the karaoke version.
Jamie doesn't sing.
Okay, we're getting a Jamie mix of Dive.
It'll be done on Kazoo.
I can't wait for that.
Alright, we'll be right back.
We're going to take a real quick break and we're going to start with the fuck you's of the week so send those to me over private message.
You've got to be in our chat room and just send those over to Skye, S-K-I-E and then we'll read those.
That'll be the first thing because Jamie's got a lot she wants to say and I'm very, very scared.
What else can I say?
My voice doesn't give up before then.
I can only hope.
We'll see you in a little bit.
Later.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
and many more.
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
Orange Lounge Radio.
You leave for a week and everything goes to hell.
And the show goes to hell.
And you know, on top of that, I miss seeing my gay boy action, okay?
What?
I miss Yali Park.
Tell us all about... And I was there.
Okay, tell us all about what you were leaving for...
What the hell?
Somebody's sending their alarm like right outside my window.
Anyway, tell everybody about why you left last weekend, what the plan was that you were going to be gone for, and what ended up making you late and all that.
I was going to go to Yaoi Con because I wanted to go by Dojinshi because, damn it, I'm a nerd.
So Julie says, okay, well, we're going to leave in the morning after my class.
So they canceled her class.
It doesn't matter because Julie still didn't get to my house until six in the evening.
Describe Yaoi for everybody who may not know.
Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove
I drove by there and I was like, well, that's pretty cool.
Okay.
I think Dark Tetsuya lives by Man Love.
Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying.
Anyway, anyway, I was going to go to YaoiCon so I could, you know, look at all the pretty art and watch the pretty anime and see the pretty boys.
And, you know, see cosplayers and stuff.
So we get there and we decide that it's late, so we go to Pacific East Mall.
It's not in Berkeley, but near Berkeley.
Wait, hold on.
Do cosplayers for yaoi like dress up as naked men or something?
No!
God.
Anyway.
So I go and I have this chat with this really nice guy there about the Trueno, because I want one.
For people who have no knowledge of Toyotas or Initial D, it's basically it was the Corolla in Japan, so.
And I want one, and I actually liked the car before I ever heard of the anime.
Anyway, we ended up just hanging out.
Oh, your horn works, you whore!
If that's not picking up over our microphone, somebody's honking the horn quite obnoxiously outside.
Oh, Jamie's going to go do something about it.
God, I hope the mic picked that up.
Jamie just went over to the window and went,
We're trying to do a show!
Anyway, we go hang out at Krista's house.
Actually, we went to San Francisco and picked up Krista, who was working at the convention with a Japanese guest.
What?!
The people outside are screaming.
This is, okay.
We just heard the N-word.
Away from the bad radio.
Anyway, we drove all over San Francisco.
We ate at Mizune and Kintetsu Mall.
Went back, crashed out.
Got up the next day with the full intention of spending the $30 to get into the convention so we could go shopping in the dealer's room.
And, oh, don't forget, pay $15 to park.
I hate that.
Frisco can go to hell and die for costing so much to park in.
Well, we went all over the place and Julie and I sat back and we went, you know what, fuck that.
We decided not to go to YowieCon.
So we went all over the place and spent a bunch of money instead.
And then we walked Krista's dog in Berkeley.
We get back.
We decided that we were going to go to Network Video because we thought we had time.
We didn't realize that we got back at 5.
Network Video being the local import video game store?
Local meaning Bay Area.
We had an hour to get there.
So we get in the car.
We're on our way to Network Video.
We get stuck in evil traffic going into San Francisco.
It took us an hour just to get past the toll booth from Berkeley to there.
I call Rob at, what, 6-something?
Um, Rob, guess what?
We're in traffic at the toll booth.
Going into San Francisco.
So, finally, you know that really weird phone call where, you know, I couldn't hear anything?
That was me calling from Mifune again over my Oyako Donburi phone.
DarkSakura.com
Golden Girls Poster
Yes.
I want a Golden Girls poster and I want some cheesecake.
I need to do my Fuck You of the Week because I have my Fuck You of the Week.
We're getting into the Fuck You of the Week.
Thank you for that nice segue.
Here we go.
Okay, my Fuck You of the Week goes toward JJ North's cheesecake today.
JJ North is... JJ North sounds like... It's like a hometown buffet.
It sounds like a clothing store.
But for people that are back east, it's also like the Piccadilly, basically.
Well, not necessarily like Piccadilly, because that's more of a cafeteria type place.
It's basically a big buffet.
You know, just all kinds of crappy food that's been sitting out for five hours.
Anyway, I hadn't eaten at JJ North in forever.
And Waffle Square, okay, damn them, they were busy.
That should be Chicken and Waffle Square.
Full of old people.
So, we decided to go to JJ North's because I was actually feeling good today.
Because I went home early Friday because I was sick, as you can't tell from my face.
Anyway, that was gross.
So I go, and I'm all happy because the food sucks and I want a cheesecake.
I eat a cheesecake and it tastes like the meringue topping from a lemon meringue pie.
It was really gross.
And so, that sucks.
My second fuck you of the week goes to Rob.
For... Yay!
Christina sluttier and stuff behind my back on Friday.
Okay.
Thank you, bitch!
We played like a bunch of really... Oh, we played that Legend, the Legend song, the Zelda rap.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
I'll have to play that tonight for our regular listeners.
Oops.
We're still on yours.
Anyway, yeah, and to intro the Dirty songs, I played Dirty.
But it was a chat room.
It was a chat room that made me play the full version.
Specifically, it was... Specifically, it was SoCalKicks.
Not that I'm going to point fingers.
SoCalKicks, you can bite me.
No GameCube pen for you.
You still have to send me proof.
And we tried doing the ghetto phone thing on the show, but it doesn't really work.
That's okay, chat room.
I really love you guys.
And you know, I miss you all, but my aim is improving.
I practice.
Really, I do.
My other fuck you of the week goes toward all of you who gave me this cold.
You know, this virus, cold, bacteria, needs to die already because I'm getting sick of being sick.
You're sick of being sick?
Uh, yeah.
Um, and my other Fakula League goes toward, um, um, Contra Shattered Soldier because it was really loud and I wanted to go to bed last night.
Fair enough.
Which, oh, everybody's going to be hearing about that later because it's Konami and damn it, I say so.
Okay, do we have any other FUs of the week in the house?
Next.
Let's move on to Dave.
Oh, Loki's next.
Yes, Loki!
Oh wait, I gotta find Loki's music.
Name my song!
I have a song for Loki, but I have to find it.
Fill in, just start, I'll cue in your music later.
Anyways, first FU goes...
Please stop.
Okay.
Anyways, first FU goes to my fucking headache.
because my head hurts and it doesn't feel good.
Probably from ice training and me staying up until 4 in the morning working on my website.
Yeah, so F you to my stupid headache.
And also F you to the stupid movie Transporter.
God damn it, that movie is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
It is a waste of your time.
Seriously, it doesn't have any redeeming parts of it at all.
It's just crap.
Crap Disguise like a good action movie.
And also, actually another FU to a movie that's going to be coming out, Extreme Ops.
Extreme sports and spies do not mix.
Stop trying to do that.
What was Triple X?
It was Vin Diesel.
Oh, he's a beefcake, so it's okay.
It was, hey, this is Fast and the Furious as a spy.
That's what it was.
Extreme Ops.
It's a bald James Bond.
Extreme Ops.
A bald, fat James Bond.
These people happen to go up to this, like, lodge, and, oh, there happens to be a terrorist base in this lodge.
Who would have thought that there's a terrorist base in this lodge?
Wow, what are the odds of that?
Oh, it's one of the most notorious criminals, too.
Ooh, who would have thought that?
What are the odds of that happening?
Sorry, could you repeat that for our audience here?
I'm sorry, will you finish?
Uh, yes, I'm finished.
Okay.
I don't really have much of a fuck you, but fuck you weekdays for being really long.
Oh, it's Giants are one.
In the fourth inning was Giants 1, Angels 4.
This is not sports talk, this is Ben Mani.
Get on with the fuck yous.
On with the fuck yous.
Anyway, fuck you weekdays for having five of them compared to only two weekend days.
Because weekends are cool and weekdays are shit because there is school or work for whoever has work.
You know what?
All of you people in Japan are lucky because women get one PMS day a month to call in sick.
We need that in America.
so that I don't have to bitch at people at work and I can just stay at home and bitch.
Back to you.
Okay, that's it.
I'm done.
Oh, no, I get one.
I get one.
My fuck you of the week is the fact that drinking inhibits one's ability just to drive.
No, I didn't do anything stupid.
But last night I went out to the local bar, the local number one bar.
And I was the designated driver.
And my two friends I was with were the designated drunks.
When I'm drunk, I have a lot more fun.
But no, I have to drive, so I can't do any drinking.
That didn't stop me from having a pebble shot when we first got there, which, by the way, is Red Bull mixed with Malibu.
Very good, you should try it sometime.
But of course, since I was there for four hours... Red Bull is the color of piss.
And it smells like pussy, what's your point?
Okay.
So, uh, it took, uh, we were there for four hours, so I wasn't driving drunk or anything.
I had plenty of time to get that out of my system.
But my two friends, when they get very drunk, they're bold as hell and just, you know, have a lot of fun.
A lot, a lot of fun.
And, uh, I, uh, I had fun, but I was just kind of just sitting there, kind of, yeah, I'm the driver.
Wee.
But my costume owned.
I don't know if you guys saw my costume.
Did you see my costume on my journal?
I saw that.
That was pretty cool.
It was a milk box with the missing and then it went on your head.
Yeah, so it was a big hat.
It was a big milk carton that says missing and it has my head in it.
And I'm sure somebody will post a picture in the chat room.
Somebody will post a link to the picture of my Halloween costume.
I just had 24 chocolate covered espresso memes.
So, my FU is towards DUIs.
Do people need to come and help me make my costume?
Because I've been lazy.
I've had the stuff to make my costume now.
Let's get to the chatroom FUs.
JB says, F you to Nobody Buying Me the new Jenny Rom single, Ika Uka.
Actually, I don't know if that's new.
I just said it was.
And also to Makeup for Not Coming Off, Stupid Halloween Makeup.
You can check it out at his journal.
I'm too lazy to give the URL, so he'll have to post that in the chat room.
And F you to his math book for having a Spanish glossary or whatever.
It made him mad because I couldn't find the English one.
Whatever.
SoCalKick says, fuck you, Weekend, for being boring as fuck, and funk you, Sky, funk, I said funk.
Fuck that.
And fuck you, Sky, for superliminally making me expose myself.
Okay, whatever.
He exposed himself in the chat room.
He pulled down his pants and made us cry.
Twin says... I'm just kidding.
I'm so going to get smacked.
Twin says F you to his arcade for having to send the DDR boards and kit to some guy to get it upgraded to Max 2.
F you to never being able to get on early enough because of his damn mother.
F you to GJBadSite for going completely down for the past two days.
And...
He has a super secret message for Loki, and then F you to people who watch baseball.
Actually, DJ Bad's site isn't down.
Just the download section is.
He has his GeoCity site still up, though.
Woo!
Wait, and I don't watch baseball.
My parents do, and they're all like, Yeah, it's 4-1 Angels!
Or whatever.
Actually, they like the Giants.
But anyway, that's not the point.
The point is I don't watch it.
But Loki seems to like it, so... Can I continue?
The point is that Cal Expo...
Continuing on with the FUs of the week.
23rd Magus says, I have a big fuck me to all available ladies.
Seriously, my fuck you is to Philips and ATI for making drivers that free step mania.
Fuck you mentally deficient coders.
Wait.
Everybody in the chatroom wants their own theme music.
No.
No.
Pyro Man says, F you to AIM and their goddamn identical windows because of this.
Fuck!
I just typed, yay, this porno is almost done downloading to this chick I like.
Fucking wrong instant message windows.
Ugh, I've so ruined my chances with her.
That's why you say, ha ha ha ha, that was funny.
Ha ha, joke.
You want to come over and watch?
That's like that cable, or what was it, that beer commercial or something like that where the woman comes over.
Hey, is this the adult channel?
Why, yes it is.
and then, like, you know, they advertise the beer or something like that.
Arcadian in the chatroom is indicating DJ Bad might be back up, so go look.
Yay!
Uh, I already did those FUs.
Let's see, DarkTetsuya says, Fuck you to McDonald's for having happy meals of both Transformers and Hello Kitty.
Dude!
Why is that a bad thing?
Oh, that's true, you have to choose.
I want the boy kind.
Dude, that'd be cool.
Dude, I don't... Transforming Hello Kitty.
Dude, you win.
Dude, anyway.
And Black Lab says, F you, number one, to fuck this 1600 word paper that is due tomorrow that he hasn't started on yet.
Whoops.
Fuck his roommate for missing his train at 8am Saturday, thus ruining his chances for a peaceful weekend to myself.
Just Black Lab and his pornography collection.
Just kidding.
Fuck his roommate again for bringing home some girl last night and making out until all hours of the morning while I was still in the room.
Yeah, you don't do that shit with your roommate in there.
and you don't do that shit with your roommate I lived in a dorm room, hello you do not have people over making out in the dorm room when your roommate is there you pay your roommate to go play at the arcade unless she's really hot and swings that way, so but anyway you still go somewhere else to make out it's courteous I don't want to listen to two people sucking on each other unless I'm allowed to participate
You know, you feel left out.
Scorecard.
BlackLadsFUs are always fun.
Yes.
And fuck shitty Verizon brand phones for sucking ass and shitting off at... Oh, shutting off.
He left out a vowel, so I put in my own.
And shitting off at random times and not hold...
That's it.
He got cut off.
His Verizon phone cut him off.
That's it.
That's all the chatroom FUs.
We're done.
No more FUs in the chatroom.
Come on, everybody.
You can always get up and do the catch-up song dance.
No.
No.
You know what?
I actually have a happy fuck you, though.
Oh, you do?
Oh, you have a happy fuck you?
I have a happy one.
Let's see.
I need happy music.
Happy and special.
I need happy music.
What's happy music?
Um... No, I'm not doing it to do Petite Love.
Um... Cutie Chaser.
Okay.
And... Go ahead and start.
I'll cue in the music.
I don't want dead air.
Well...
Nintendo has gone and done it again.
I am once again addicted to one of their products.
Let's hear it for Animal Crossing.
I have been coming home worrying about my virtual mortgage and how the hell I'm going to pay it off with fish and bugs.
Tom Nook is an asshole and I want Mallory to move out of my village.
The fucking duck bitch needs to move.
And I hate that bitch Phyllis at night in the post office.
Oh my god, they need to gut her.
Just do her over an open fire!
You're talking about a video game, might I remind you?
Yes I am!
And dammit, Lobo is cool because he's a big wolf and he's up until 3 in the morning.
But fuck you Nintendo and thank you.
I love Animal Crossing and I hate you bitches.
But I need to play more Kingdom Hearts 2.
Oh yes, that's my happy thing is that I'm finally with the times.
For those that know me, I am so behind the times when it comes to like regular mainstream video games.
I'm just now playing through Final Fantasy X, right?
But I finally was able to make a trade tonight.
I traded off my 2DX controllers to my neighbor who lives like two blocks up the street.
Well, he's not really my neighbor, but he lives two blocks up.
And in return I got Kingdom Hearts!
So I finally get to play and see what the big fuss is about.
You know all the cool kids are playing Animal Crossing.
Hello, where have you been?
My next fuck you, my fuck you goes to money.
Because I don't have enough money.
I need more money because I can't afford a GameCube and I can't get Animal Crossing.
And Jamie tells me how much fun it is and I get to see how she has all her cute little shirts and stuff and I can't play because I'm poor.
He gets to listen to me yell at Mallory because she's a stupid bitch and yell at all the people.
And then I did design the coolest outfit and it was inspired by my Gothic and Lolita Bible.
I just had a silent moment.
Thank you, Rob.
You're welcome.
Rob totally broke my concentration.
Blame him for the train wreck.
Fuck you, Rob.
So when are you going to do your random shows?
I'll buy you more orange balls.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Jamie, for buying me big orange balls.
I appreciate that.
I have some big, fluffy, squishy orange balls, and I put them in my mouth before the show.
Yes, he did, but I didn't watch because I had cupcakes.
And I had snowballs, so you perverts can, you know, go to hell.
Why do they call him Snowball?
Because you spit them into your girlfriend's mouth.
Yay, random.
Go watch Clerks, all of you, right now.
You poor, deprived people.
I see my buddy Travis joined the chat room, so I want to say hello.
I'm glad you're listening.
That's so cool.
I hope everything's going good for you in Texas.
This is for you.
The stars at night shine big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.
I'm so going to get smacked.
Dude, I want to watch Pee Wee now.
That's the second Pee Wee reference I've made tonight.
That's pretty scary.
When I yelled at the people across the street.
Yes, the people across the street, by the way, have been quiet.
Because the thing is, I would have been inspired again by Animal Crossing by taking my axe and treating them like a tree.
And cutting them down.
Are you saying that you would have chopped up their booty?
Yes, the word of the night is booty.
Anything associated with the booty.
You say the ass, we say my baby mama.
I ain't gonna ask you what the word of the day is again, okay?
Listen, bitch.
Anyway, that is the word of the evening is booty.
At least we're not raving again, okay?
Although the raving was pretty fun.
I agree.
Tell us, what was that remix we heard right before the show started?
That mix of Sandstorm and... And Children, the Robert Miles song.
This was, I went home after the rave show and decided, you know what, I don't have this song on my computer and I kind of want it.
So I went on Kazalite, yay, because it's the only thing that will work with my firewall.
And I went downloading Sandstorm.
I downloaded one that was called Children of the Sandstorm.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
It's tentatively Tuesday from what I understand.
Game stops are getting there.
We're hearing Monday, Tuesday.
We're hearing all sorts of days.
I have my unopened demo in my purse.
Konami is shipping it out this week, and whenever the stores get it, they get it.
And then your grubby little hands can go buy it.
You know what we could do during one of the later breaks?
What?
Go put in my demo.
You know, the demo you've got is the same demo, but it's synced.
Did you actually see it?
Have you played that?
I haven't seen it.
I have the PlayStation Magazine demo.
Did you actually see the demo?
Yeah, I saw the demo that you got.
It's pretty cool.
We can go out and hook it up.
We'll do that during one of the breaks.
Huh?
Well, it's the newer version of the demo, because I guess what happened is that the original PlayStation Magazine demo was actually an older version of the demo, and the arrows were all missynced on two of the songs.
Isn't that nice?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I think this is a really weird thing to have in a home version because most people haven't spent the hundred bucks on an ignition pad and most people don't have metal pads.
Most people are playing with those ghetto little pads, either, you know, the, what do they call them, the beat stage pads or what are those things called, the ghetto ones you can buy at Fry's.
What are those called?
The ass pad.
I don't know, the ass pad.
You can buy these ass pads and that's what most people play with.
Did I say booty?
I'm sorry.
Ass booty.
We're in.
Internet access.
And yes, the Margaret Cho fans would get that.
DeadAir.
Oni's Fries.
People buy these booty-ass pads at Fries.
I'm kidding.
Anyway, you play Oni mode on these really crappy pads.
You're going to be halfway across the room by the time you finish, and there's no way you're going to be able to keep... You're not even going to be able to pass that dumbed-down-for-Americans Oni, the lesson Oni, or whatever it's called.
You're not even going to be able to pass that on most normal homepads.
So it seems very odd to me.
I thought they do non-stops.
I thought we'd have non-stops, but I didn't think we'd have only.
I have to admit I'm surprised.
Well, this is what we have on the back of the demo, though, for DVR Max.
Okay!
On one of the images, it has screen capture of the select list.
We have healing vision, insertion, let the beat hit him, look to the sky, love again tonight, midnight blaze, paranoia evolution, Orion 78.
It says over 70 songs.
Yes, over 70 songs.
Let me see.
I'm just reading this.
Let's see.
Revolutionary to the max.
The evolution of the revolution is here with DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution.
Get ready to experience maximum dancing with all new songs and game modes, high energy pulsating music, and stunning graphics.
The ultimate dancing game is now revolutionary to the max.
Dear Diary, that guy who wanted to be just like a sick was reading the back of the American version of Dance Dance Revolution.
Just listening to his voice makes me all excited in special places.
Love, Naoki.
Actually, I think I've seen that screenshot before about a couple weeks ago.
But we can also check that out during one of the breaks and see what's available on the demo.
One thing, though, that I did note is that the demo disc is one of the blue CDs, which means it's not DVD.
If the last release of Max is any indication, the one that came out for PS2 in Japan, it's also on a CD.
So I'm sort of thinking that the new one's not going to be on a DVD, so we may be seeing video sacrifices.
I'm not sure.
Rob?
I think it's going to be on DVD.
Rob, I think that you should do the intro and be the announcer for the DDR Max, because you read a lot better than the announcer right now.
Hey, Konami, if you're out there listening, I want to be the new announcer, so send me a letter.
or something.
Shoot me an email.
You should just get the guy from Ridge Racer to do it because he sounds like the original announcer anyway.
Send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
I've got everything on camera so you can watch it again.
You're the greatest.
SoCalKicks is stamping his foot and insisting that DDR Max USA is on a DVD.
It's confirmed.
Whatever that means.
They need to get Bobcat, whatever.
Bobcat Goldthwait.
Yes.
He would be the best DDR announcer.
I think you fucked up.
Dude, you suck.
Excuse me, but I think you suck.
Who else?
This is a good topic.
Who else would be a good DDR announcer?
Bill Cosby.
You can play DDR and have a put-in-pot.
What about female announcers?
Charo, oh my god, that just, that dated you right there, that's like, Hollywood Squares from the 80s is the only thing I ever remember seeing Charo from, and Joan Rivers, oh, Joan Rivers, that would be the best, oh my god, oh my god, can we talk, you're dancing, it's fucking awful, oh my god, talk to my daughter Melissa, what are those shoes, you're wearing shoes with fire on them,
Dude, my shoes kick ass.
Don't talk about my burning feet.
Okay?
I could just imagine, though, various other announcers, like, you know, like, Pauly Shore.
Good suggestion.
Pauly Shore, that's an excellent one.
Thank you.
Or, like, Keanu Reeves.
Dude, you know DDR.
Or are Mike Myers doing the coffee talk lady?
That's what they're suggesting there?
You're dancing?
Now I'm eclipsed.
Dance amongst yourselves.
Here's the topic.
Here's the song.
Dance Dance Revolution is neither dancing nor revolution.
Discuss.
It would work.
Oh my god.
Call me up and talk about it.
It's 555-4444.
You're dancing?
It's like butter.
You know, this song here.
Why don't you dance to this Barbara song?
I heard Barbara do it.
Black Lab suggests Carrot Top.
Oh my God.
Dial down the center.
Mr. T, I pity the food and don't play DDR.
And who else would we have?
Let's see.
Who else does good?
How about the movie guy?
The guy that does all the voice?
Mr. Movie Phone.
Oh, hello, and thank you for playing DDR.
If you would like to play, let them move.
Press 1 now.
Nobody presses 1.
This song is rated R for language and nudity.
The only person who presses 1 would be... Doing the copy guy.
Alright, DDR.
DDR, making copies.
Anyway, that was pretty funny.
There's still more.
I know there's more.
Okay.
Roseanne could be the female announcer.
I can't even do Roseanne right now.
What is wrong with your dance?
You suck.
You dance like you're fat.
Margaret, no, Margaret chose mom.
Margaret chose mom.
Mom!
Louis Anderson.
Louis Anderson.
Your dancing is gay, but I'm not gay, I swear.
Okay.
I can't do it as good as Travis does.
If I try to do Louie Anderson, I feel like I have to throw back to him because he's the ultimate Louie Anderson impersonating.
Miss Cleo, yes, thank you.
Oh, don't you know you get the first three minutes of dancing for free?
It's in the cards.
It's in the cards.
But you have to pay in advance.
Send me all your money.
I don't read tarot cards.
I read database.
Does the chatroom have any suggestions?
No, but DSCS says everyone go to Fry's because they have Max USA early.
Well, poopy on Fry's.
Too bad I already spent five bucks pre-ordering it somewhere else.
Yes, thank you.
And all of you people who did not reserve your copy at my fiance's GameStop, poopy on you.
Unless you don't live in town.
Wait a second.
They have it out right now?
Now everybody's going to run over there.
Yeah, maybe they have it, but that doesn't mean they're out on the shelves.
Along with AT&T, whose logo is the Death Star.
Ooh, I get a sampler CD.
I can see what new crap's coming out on PlayStation.
Anyway.
If the sampler CD doesn't have Animal Crossing or Metroid Prime, I don't want to hear about it.
Dude, Metroid Prime.
Okay.
Forget Mimani for a second.
Jamie hates first person shooters, and I love Metroid Prime, thank you.
I miss the trash can too.
Metroid Prime is the most godly, beautiful looking first person shooter ever.
Tell us more about it.
It's like... What is it?
It's Metroid, but it's like... What do you do?
Why do they make it first person?
You walk around and shoot shit.
In prettiness.
Is it like Doom?
Kind of, but unlike Doom, it doesn't suck.
Okay, here's my sort of fuck you because it really pissed me off last night, but it's kind of a cool thing.
Contra Shattered Soldier.
It's related because it's Konami, okay?
So I can talk about it.
Okay, this game is fucking disgusting looking.
I walked downstairs with this blaring headache to watch them play the game.
and they're beating this bloody turtle up with these guns.
They're shooting it to death.
Then the head falls off, the thing turns around, and it has this fetus face coming out of its ass.
I kid you not.
Alright, for anybody who's ever played Vampire Savior and knows the fetus of God level, the face looks like the fetus from the fetus of God level of Vampire Savior.
Doom doesn't suck.
Did I say Doom sucked?
I said Doom sucked.
Oh, you said Doom sucked.
Doom sucks now.
Yeah, Doom sucks now.
Doom didn't suck back in... Remember when you used to call into BBSs so you could play four-player Doom?
That was the day.
Dude, I was playing Doom.
Anyway.
Well, back to Contra.
Yes, I want to hear more about fetus ass babies.
It's a big turtle with a fetus growing out of its ass.
You mean it's coming out of its booty?
It vomits fire on you.
Yo, we're gonna go down and play Contra!
We're gonna shoot some shit up!
There's this other shape that looks like it's inside of some type of muscle cavity that has sinews growing out of the top and bottom.
It looks like the inside of skin, and it's dripping blood everywhere.
That game is fucking disgusting, okay?
And Loki's doing the happy pee-pee dance.
Do you need us to go to break?
The problem is, you know, with all these good games out, I'm going to be spending about $150 on games this week.
And then the fact that I'm not going to work this week to play all these games, that's... You will get your chance to play Contra later.
He's going yay.
I don't know.
I think the last good Contra I remember was the one that was on Super Nintendo.
Because didn't they release ones on PlayStation that really sucked?
Yeah, and the one on Genesis, though, it was a decent game, but it was really hard.
Although the first Contra, this is what's kind of funny.
The first Contra, you know the palm trees in the first stage?
On the Japanese version, they were animated and the game had an intro.
It was pretty neat.
You know what really has me torn is that this week there's a couple new albums coming out.
There's the new Toriyamis albums coming out.
Yes, everybody loves Tori Amos.
I love being female.
Especially me.
I can't wait.
I get to hear 20 more songs about somebody's vagina.
No, I'm just kidding.
She doesn't sing about her vagina.
But most people assume that.
But she does eat my pussy.
That's true.
There is that recording I have where she told some guy at a concert to eat her pussy.
And then, God, what else comes out this week?
I think there's another big album coming out.
I can't remember.
I never keep up with that.
I'm busy stuck on my computer and playing DDR.
Because I play to DDR.
That new Dance Mania album?
I don't know.
I think it came out on Friday, actually.
The inside of this is blue.
With meat fire on it.
I'm looking in the inside of my demo disc case because I finally opened it and I've had it for two weeks.
You're just now looking at it?
Yes. 75%
Well, supposedly they ripped it out of the promo.
Oh, I remembered what CD was coming out this week.
What?
No!
Okay, I need to go vomit violently.
So we're going to break right now.
and I'm going to regurgitate and rob shoes.
I'm going to get my ass beat during this next break.
Uh oh, you said it.
You're going to kick my booty.
Alright, we're going to go to break.
I'm going to start this break with something that Dave's been begging me to play all night long.
And it's going to make Jamie cry, but as long as we're on her bad side, hey.
This song makes both me and Duran Duran cry.
Hello.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the door to W What is happening?
Thanks for watching!
I don't wanna say I'm sorry Cause I know there's nothing wrong Don't be afraid, there's no need to worry Cause my feelings for you are still strong
I need you so
Thank you for watching!
Hold me in your arms, and never let me go Hold me in your arms, cause I need you so
Thanks for watching!
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio
and Jamie's throwing a fit because... They're raping my demo.
There were no new songs in the demo.
It hadn't been in the old demo, which kind of... But they're synced.
They are synced.
In sync.
They are in sync.
Bye, bye, bye.
No, I have names for them.
It's in sync in 98.
Loki and Dave are back there trying to see if they can get Max 300 in the demo, which I told them they wouldn't be able to.
And... Nope.
I knew it.
I knew it too.
I was sitting there walking.
What can you do?
Are you playing with a ferret?
Oh, I'm supposed to talk about... Crap!
Booty!
What?
Booty?
Booty.
Give me my demo, bitch.
Give me my demo.
I need my blue disc shininess.
I was supposed to talk about what I showed you guys during the very opening break of the show.
SoCalKicks is helping us work on a new website.
And I showed it off to everybody in the room during the first break.
And it's pretty so far.
So we can't wait to see the finished product.
So hurry it up.
I'm just kidding.
It's orange.
I love getting other people to do work for me.
Thank you.
I take back my fuck you, by the way.
Give me a dollar.
It was moving.
Yes, it was.
It was like a bowel movement.
Dave, I'm supposed to give you a special hello from Rai Rai.
She's listening right now.
Hi.
Yes, hi.
He likes cheese, too.
Let's see.
What else is there to talk about today?
Let's do a sim update from Loki.
Let's hear all about what's going on in the sim world.
Nothing.
No, there's lots going on.
The truth.
Yeah, a ton of stuff's going on.
Let's start with the obvious stuff.
Step Mania.
No ferrets.
are part of the Sim Update.
Okay, anyways, Step Mania 3 Final has finally been released, so everyone go enjoy that.
They have, of course, Para Para support and Easy to Dancer support and Pump It Up support, so it's just a bit more than just DDR, so go try that, and their editor kicks ass, they use it for everything.
Aside from that, DJ Bad's site is of course down at the moment.
Actually, it's because Music Gaming Zone's site is down.
Because he was using them as an affiliate, he's down as well.
Not too bad for that because I needed their files.
Also, there's also my site.
If anyone has been reading any of the boards lately, I've announced that I'm doing a project
where I'm making a DWI for every single Beatmania 2DX song out there.
So that started off pretty good so far.
I've been averaging about one song a day.
Right now I've got three of my originals up on my site.
I've got Love is Orange, The Sound of Goodbye, and of course another one for Sakura.
I have one of those.
Plus I'm hosting some files for other people.
I've got VJ Army by Moogle Hunter.
And there's a couple other...
Files up there.
So go check it out.
It's www.leachfromloki.tk So go check that out.
It's pretty awesome.
Yeah, good shit.
Other than that, really not too much going on.
There's about 4 billion files out there for Sakura, so if you don't like mine, go play someone else's.
Pretty much it.
Go play someone else's.
If you don't like my stuff, too bad.
Exactly.
Other than that, DDRPC, they released a nice Halloween-themed set of characters.
They have one guy...
Hey, I like the one character and it looks like Jack from... They're cool, but just DDRPC is kind of... Alright, DDRPC sucks ass.
The only reason I play DDRPC is because of the characters.
The only one that anyone really pays attention to is... Pantless Rage.
Yes, if they had Pantless Rage, I'm sure it would get everyone's attention.
And Titless... Three-Titted Emmy, was it?
Three-Titted Emmy and Pantless Rage.
Yeah.
from a long time ago.
How long ago was that?
Episode number seven.
Pretty sad I know that, huh?
Black Lab would like to hear from the ferret.
Says we need to give the ferret some air time, so go for it.
That was the ferret.
and now Jamie and I have something else to get out of our system.
So cute!
So cute!
So cute!
We're looking at a picture of the guy I used to host Under Station Live with, Travis, moved to Texas and Jenna's in the picture.
Jenna-chan!
It's so cute!
I'm so happy!
Oh, it's so cute.
It's so cute.
Twin, no.
No four-titted sky.
Jesus.
What?
Oh, God, no.
The parent likes the idea.
Now that we got that squealing out of our system.
JB says, oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I'm going to.
He's working on the graphics officially for Step Mania's PPP mode.
Winner!
From local input.
Winner.
Parapara's cool.
Then we can finally do a Parapara to stuff like my baby mama.
Actually, that's one cool thing about the Parapara support, is it has the drivers built in for the actual controller, so if you have a Parapara controller out there... Which I do not.
And a USB port, you just plug it in and it works.
I have one.
So it's awesome.
Plugging it in and in and in.
So, yeah, look for that.
I bought it from George.
Go download it now.
I know it's sometimes... Oh yeah, DWI, well, they're still at version 2.03.
They've been at 2.03 for like months now.
I think DWI is dead.
We don't know.
They could come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden, you know, it could be DWI Extreme.
They're playing catch-up right now.
It's pretty bad.
Catch-up.
They're playing catch-up.
No, I'm not going to play the catch-up song.
Do the dance in your little mind, Dave.
Please don't.
Exactly.
Speaking of DDR Extreme, any other new news that we're finding out about that?
I know there were some pictures that came out, and basically it just looks like Max 3, so I have no idea why they bothered to change the name.
For anyone who has a live journal and is interested, there are people who are giving random updates now and again
LiveJournal.com
They're coming out, they're bringing back a lot of old songs that I've noticed.
As well as, as long as a bunch of really good ones.
The whole thing is that they're just starting a new engine.
That's just what it is.
It's just, they're just changing names.
That's it.
Yeah, Max was a new engine.
I mean, it was Max and Max 2, and now Max 3.
So are they still tweaking it?
Max was a new engine.
It had the full motion video.
It had the freeze arrows.
It was different enough to be in the name.
So what is it going to do?
It's extremely not different.
Vibrate or something?
Going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings?
It's green.
Dual shock dance pad.
It's going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings in the special places.
The only real announcements that they made is a few of the songs that were only in the only modes are playable.
Like Jet World, that was one of them.
At least 100 seconds.
My fiance said something Whenever they come out with a game series and they release an extreme version He says that means it's the nail in the coffin
And you know, from what I've been hearing, DDR is a dying game.
DDR is dying.
But as I told Dan, lately it's been that if it's the last one, it's going to be the final.
So I don't think this is DDR the final yet.
Nope, not yet.
I don't think it's the last one either.
I don't think they've milked every single cent out of it they can yet.
And with Max coming out in the USA being pretty much, agreeably, the best home release on any system yet.
Matt's hand shot up in the air.
Actually, I was just going to mention something that, you know, you're mentioning Max and stuff and kind of DDR becoming more well-known and stuff.
On Thursday, Halloween, okay, they're going to have, actually, it's going to be on CBS this morning.
I think it's like the morning show, CBS morning show.
They're going to be doing exhibitions for DDR on the show live, and they're going to be covering it throughout the whole show, which will get a lot of publicity, at least out there.
Too bad it's in New York, otherwise that'd be fun to go to.
That means there's only going to be like five people who play good.
I don't know, there's a pretty good... You're nice.
No, actually, there is a pretty good DDR community in New York, and I found this out after, you know, having to keep an eye on the New York thread for a while.
But, you know, I've actually seen a few of the people from New York play, at least in videos and things, and there's a pretty good crowd there, so I'd really look forward to seeing that.
Wasn't somebody from here playing out there?
Or is that happening?
Who, what?
I thought it was DJ 8-Ball that was going up there.
Aren't they going to have to letterbox Ezekiel?
No comment.
I'm sorry, was that my outside voice?
I'm sorry.
Anyway.
That's not nice.
We're a nice, friendly radio station, goddammit.
Aren't we?
We're fucking wonderful people.
We're nice, caring, wonderful, goddamned people.
And you love us.
Worship us.
Black Lab says Nobody Jen will be there.
Yes, she's a member of RTF.
I haven't met her, but I've heard very good things about her.
Yes.
Cool.
Except there's parts of her... I'm not going to comment on that, because I commented on that when we made suggestions for what would be scored on in the Shaft tourney.
Okay.
I'm sorry, but... And she's really good for freestyle.
But how is it going to score you points with judges by grabbing your boobs?
Okay?
As part of her routine.
I'd like to make a comment on that.
Shut up!
Give me that microphone.
You are not a host.
Give me the microphone.
That heavily weighs on score, I believe, man.
Grabbing one's boob is not a show of talent.
If I grab my boob in the middle of a freestyle routine, will you give me a hundred...
Now, I said it didn't count for you.
It might count against you, but I said it scores heavily.
Depending.
Yeah.
What if my boobs aren't very heavily?
A person should be judged on how well they perform not grabbing your boob.
Hey, that's performance.
Yeah, maybe in a strip club.
But then, like, all the cheerleaders on the NFL teams and all the professional sports teams would get fired.
But what if you grab your boobs on mirror mode?
Then you're really fucked.
You remember the whole mirror thing?
You know, I believe that was a year ago today was SCAT.
October 27th, right?
Yes, it was.
Yes, a year ago today.
We were having our show on the anniversary of...
The Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament, where we had four people cosplay.
But they were all very good.
Yes, we had Ryan running around in his Afronova costume.
And it was funny because Ryan didn't even try to enter.
He just happened to dress up like the guy from Afronova.
And then he's like, hey, wait, cosplay?
I'll enter.
Yeah, it was pretty cool.
And we had, who else was there?
Fiona.
Dr. Hikaru, who, because we're nice, we're not going to comment on her.
Yeah, great, cosplay, wonderful.
She had a really nice Milia costume, Milia Rage from Guilty Gear X. We had Jossie in her petite carrot, her puchiko outfit.
And then we had, of course, Ryan Zafranova costume.
And then we had Satsuki as Devilzuki, who Travis interviewed.
DarkSakura.com
I don't want sprinkles on mine.
Those interviews were hilarious.
I want them very bad.
I wish he would... That's a bummer about him being in Texas, too, is now he can't do our Shaft interviews.
But that's okay, because we're going to have Orange Lounge, hopefully, streaming all day long.
Oops.
Oops!
Yeah, it was funny, because I remember he gave, like, a little sex quiz to all the people that he interviewed, except Dr. Hikaru, because he was scared of what she might answer as, like, for some of the answers he gave.
Yes, please.
No, we are not here.
Like I said, we are nice, goddammit, and we are going to behave.
We are fucking wonderful people.
We're going to behave like degenerates.
Next, please.
So, anyway, I guess... Travis wants to know what the hell I'm talking about.
I think he just heard me say his name and he suddenly woke up.
Since we're on the tournament discussion subject, though... Yes.
Everyone, go to sakbemani.com, click on the link for Shaft...
Go get some Shaft!
My head hurts.
Yeah, tons of prizes.
I...
It's so much so that in order to not look strange, you know, leaving work with like box loads of DVDs, I'm going to have to like smuggle them out of my work like one box at a time.
Yeah, one box at a time, like 50 DVDs per day.
I mean, it's crazy.
Yeah, that's right.
He said 50 DVDs per day.
So the door prices at SCAT, or I'm sorry, at Shaft...
Almost everybody's walking home with something.
You know, we go to so many tournaments and people are always like, well, the same people always win.
Well, if you show up, everybody's a winner.
Just about.
While supplies last.
We are also assuming everything works out properly.
We are going to have a demo of DDR Max, the USA one.
Yes.
We are also, you know, we've been having these meetings.
Basically, the tournament is in two weeks.
We're having, I've talked to a couple people who are coming from out of state, which is going to be good.
We're going to have a big turnout for this.
You know, Scandia has really been wonderful in helping us.
We are having, we're having a bake sale.
If you want to contribute to the bake sale, bring us your... I'm making arrow cookies for the bake sale.
We need pro cookies, too.
And afro cookies.
We need the afro cookies.
And, you know, we have Rice Krispie treats with, you know, little Beat Mania... We're going to have Beat Mania bars.
Yeah, we'll have Beat Mania bars.
You know, if anybody wants to be in on the fun, you know, bring us your... We should, like, get pineapple and cut them into arrows, and then we can have some fruity paras.
Oh.
Ha ha ha ha.
DarkSakura.com
including the possibility of an orange lounge chair.
Yes, we're looking into that.
Seeing if we can get that to happen, an orange lounge chair.
We're trying to make that happen.
But the tournament's going to be big, you know, for any of you who can't afford to fly out from whatever country or potent county you live in, feel free to.
We like company.
You can take a plane, you can take a train, you can take a bus, you can take a boat, you can walk.
And if you're walking, leave now.
And if you happen to be a paraplegic, you can squirm.
DJ Morpheus says every 10th person there can get a free bottle of Kaboom
Winner!
Alright!
Kaboom!
The new orange!
Dude, I'm going to put that in the orange.
Thank you for the idea.
Thank you for the idea.
I'm going to put some kaboom in the back.
We need to get little red bouncy balls and give them out as happy fun ball.
It's happy.
It's fun.
It's happy fun ball.
We're going to give bouncy balls.
We're going to give you balls.
They didn't even come to the tournament because I say so.
Come or die.
Skate or die!
That's dating you now.
I had my Charo reference.
Alright, we're going to take a break.
And when we come back, what are we going to do?
Are we going to talk about something else?
Are we going to do a list list?
List list.
List list for what?
We'll think of something.
We'll think of something.
Okay, this might be a long break while we think of what list lists we're going to do.
But a surprise list list when we come back.
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm actually looking for a song to play.
Play something.
Anything.
Like Kuchaka.
I don't have Kachaka, dammit.
We are all hopelessly addicted to Kachaka.
I'm looking for... Even those of us who haven't been able to pass it yet.
I'm looking for at least 100 seconds.
I can't find it.
Because I said we'd play that this break.
Shit.
I know what we can play.
Let's play the song.
Let's play something that we played on Friday night's fucked up show.
We're not playing Dirty.
No, we're not playing Dirty.
And we'll play...
I don't have Kataka!
We'll play some other shit.
Enjoy.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy Wedding Happy New Year, Happy New Year, I say to you every night
Thanks for watching!
I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll say to you every day I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you, everybody I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me
When's the next time that we're gonna take out the remote kit and tape some shit?
I guess Shaft, really.
Hopefully, if it all goes well, we'll be doing a test next week of this.
We're going to be doing the whole day.
Orange Lounge broadcast is going to just broadcast straight from the Scandia Golf Course all day for those of you guys that can't make it.
We'll also rebroadcast it for those of you guys that are there.
I want to hear it later.
We'll rebroadcast it at some point.
At least in bits and pieces.
What do you mean the whole day?
We're going to be broadcasting the tournament all day.
We're going to broadcast the tournament all day long.
And...
Oh, I thought you meant like just having a normal show next week all day.
That was weird.
And since Jamie and I are going to kind of be busy with tournament stuff, I'm going to be out there doing a lot of the MC stuff, and Jamie's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.
We should have junior hosts.
I'll only be able to get on the stream.
We'll call them our cupcakes.
Yes, our cupcakes.
Tal will be emceeing some of it, and I'll be in the... Oh, he might be.
I don't know what's going on.
Whatever.
From what I'm told, Tal will be doing part of it or something, depending on what's going on.
Yes, we definitely would appreciate his assistance.
And I can get on the stream while that's going on, do some interviews.
And in the meantime, we'll probably get Loki on there.
Some familiar faces have been on the show in the past.
Maybe Brad and Irene will be doing some interviews.
How can you hear my face?
Some familiar voices, then.
Yes.
We'll be doing all the interviews.
The silhouette of my mind.
So...
List List is the best song in a DVR 3rd mix or 3rd Korean machine
and we are basically leaving it at that so that in the future we can have second mix as an option and fourth mix as an option and etc.
So let's start with the most special person in the room, me.
If you want to contribute to this list, basically we're going to name our top three best third mix stuff and then we'll have a big list and then each one of us gets to remove an unworthy song from the list.
and then the chat room gets to decide on the final list.
Yes, Dave?
And if anyone says Dynamite Rave, they get punched.
Punch!
Don't punch!
I'm waiting to give the mic back to Rob.
We'll let Rob start.
I'm here.
Why do I have to start?
Because I said so.
I guess because I never start, huh?
No.
Oh, I'm also supposed to give a really quick announcement before I, because I'm cleaning out my PM windows and anticipation list list.
23rd Magus wants any locals in Sacramento or Bay Area, I guess, to go to Scandia and bring your costumes.
I don't know if there's going to be a contest or anything, but I'm just supposed to give that announcement.
It's a get-together on Halloween.
Get your Halloween DDR on.
Get your spooky on.
So give us your number three.
Alright, I'll go first because I never go first.
My number three choice for best freaking third mix stuff is Flashdance.
Flashdance fucking owns.
Yes, it does.
It was one of the first songs I ever played on the actual third mix machine.
Dave.
Dave.
Oh, okay, I was going to say that that was my first song that I did on double.
And it was a four, actually, but I failed.
Oh, okay, um... Actually, I failed the first time I ever played it.
Yeah.
Uh, this is tough.
I've got, like, six choices.
Okay, I'll go with the Boom Boom Dollar KOG mix.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Because that's cool.
And the trick one is really cool.
KOG.
Whatever.
And... Oh, sorry, KOG's...
Big fucking deal.
All right.
Yes, Loki, your number three choice.
It's gotta be Do It All Night.
Do It All Night!
Oh, yeah.
I'm glad you put that on your list, because I didn't.
My number three... Save the best for last.
Ladies last.
...is Face.
Face.
Awesome song.
Face is pretty fucking cool.
Okay.
My number two pick for best song on a third mix machine, If You Can Say Goodbye.
That's a good song.
I love that song.
If You Can Say Goodbye.
But the song is freaking amazing.
The song's freaking rad.
Your turn.
And it's one that most people forget about, but it owns.
Okay, my second choice is Song Suck, because I love the little thing in the middle.
Song Suck, Song Sucks.
Wow.
Yes, Loki.
No one can forget this.
Afronova.
Afronova.
The song is fucking gay.
The song is fucking gay.
Caution.
Caution.
Just because I can sit and listen to that song on repeat for a full hour and not even realize it.
Caution.
Most people know it as caution.
My number one choice...
Drumroll please.
Drumroll please.
Please.
I'm sure you all know this by now.
My number one song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.
That song owns.
Yes, because Rob is our erotic whore.
Fucking love that song.
Alright.
That was the song that really got me hooked on DDR.
So give it it's credit please.
Especially with karaoke mode.
Okay.
My number one choice is Beautiful 21C.
Because that song owns.
Gotta gotta ooh.
Yes.
Gotta gotta hot too.
Yes, beautiful.
See, he stole one of mine, so I'm going to let him have it, though.
No, you can have it.
Loki, your number one pick.
Now, this is probably going to get a lot of flack for this, but this is the song that I've learned on one of the songs other than Pink Dinosaur.
It's not that song, okay?
It's La Senorita.
La Senorita!
Alright, my number one pick is... Number one pick.
Gentle Stress, AMD, whatever.
WHAT?
NOT LET THEM MOVE!
Why me?
That would have been voted off really fast.
He's talking about putting... let them know.
Uh, Black Lab is bitching and moaning because we didn't put Get Up and Dance on there.
For a reason!
I was going to say that, but I knew it would get voted off.
No, the background is fucking rad.
We already found that out.
I believe that was the number one background voted in a previous episode.
But the song sucks.
It's booty.
Rob.
Volume 4.
You know, it only takes a minute to get good.
I'm sorry, what were you saying about that?
It was booty.
Booty.
Alright, so let me read off the list.
Yes, you may.
We have, we're starting, and don't forget to copy to the chat room.
Well, we have to eliminate.
Um, oh yeah.
I'm voting on Flashdance, Boom Boom, Dollar, KOGG3, Do It All Night, Face, If You Can Say Goodbye, Soong Sook, Afronova, Caution, Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful21C, La Señorita, Gentle Stress, AMD, Sexual Mix, Crap, Whatever What did you forget, Dave?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Surprisingly enough, I'm not going to go with the one that you'd think I'd vote off.
I'm actually going to take out Boom Boom Dollar, the KOG mix, because I'm sorry, the remix sucks.
The steps suck.
The original owns, but the remix sucks.
I remember having an asthma attack on that song.
So, fuck KOG.
Except for Rhythm and Police.
That was like the hardest trick song ever.
Okay.
Dave.
Damn.
I will take off.
If you can save, goodbye.
Ah, asshole.
Bitch.
Burn in hell.
Hey, Loki.
Bye, Travis.
I'm not a huge fan of these Korean songs, which is why I don't miss them.
So I'm going to have to say goodbye to SungSuk.
Yes!
Loki is my friend.
Leaving me with horrible choices left to make?
You have to eliminate one of these songs.
I fucking love playing all of these songs.
There are two that I'm floating back and forth and unfortunately they're both ones that Loki picked.
I'm going to take off Afronova.
Oh, taking off Afronova.
Because I'm pissed off at that song.
So it's for personal, you know, bitchy reasons.
Total personal vengeance.
All right.
So our list is, as soon as we have it posted to the chat room.
We have Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Señorita, and Gentle Stress, AMD's Sexual Mix.
Sounds good.
And while you guys vote, we're going to take a minute and we're going to play one of those songs that totally got neglected from our list.
and why you guys vote from it.
And it's all Dave's fault, too, by the way.
And we're going to play the full version of it.
And you can send in your votes.
And you've got three minutes to do it.
And then we're going to read the list when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Make sure to send your votes in private message.
Votes must be over private message to Sky in the chat room or they don't count.
We'll stick the ferret on you.
If you can say goodbye, baby
Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we've just been doing a little listless segment on the, what are we calling this, the best third mix or third Korean ever, right?
Yeah, this is listless third mix Korean.
Okay, yes.
So, without...
Further ado, let me read you what the list was that we had to pick from here.
Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Senorita, and Gentle Stress AMD.
And now, I reveal the results to you.
Jamie, will you please tell them what the number three song was?
Frashdance!
Frashdance, yay!
A very good song!
and the second place winner, Jamie.
Gentle Stress.
Yay!
Because I had good taste.
Gentle Stress.
And the number one song by an overwhelming margin, might I add, was, Jamie?
Do it on that.
Yay!
Do It All Night wins the... Oh my god, Do It All Night wins!
Bestest third Korean song ever.
I want to say, I don't have bad taste.
It's just everyone in the chat room who didn't vote for Beautiful 21C, because that song owns.
So cool.
And Beautiful 21C, by the way, got no votes.
You know what we should do?
What?
We should play that during one of our next breaks.
Yeah.
There are going to be no next breaks.
We'll play during the afterbirth.
We'll do it afterbirth or after the show.
That's another thing I should add, by the way.
In effect, to keep you people listening to the station, we're not going to drop listeners after the show anymore.
We'll go right into music when the show's done.
So you can stay tuned and hear random shit from Bomani and maybe more.
Yay!
It's bootylicious.
They just don't shut up about that baseball game in the chatroom.
Booty.
Booty.
I guess the Angels won, it sounds like.
Rob.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm falling asleep on the watch here.
My bad.
My bad.
No, my baby mama.
The chatroom's begging me to play the legend.
Screw them.
Afterbirth Afterbirth, okay, we'll do the legend in the Afterbirth We're never playing that fucking other song again No, we're not gonna play Dirty What?
When you're emceeing at Shaft, we need to still do the rave thing That'd be hilarious Except we're gonna get the biggest, like, you faggots look from the crowd But that's okay You got a problem with that?
You can bite my big toe That's right
Jamie was teasing the idea earlier that we ought to take this show to three hours.
What do you guys think?
Chat room, let us know.
What do you think?
Three hours or what?
Or send us your comments over email, orangelounge, radio, yahoo.com.
I said that if we do three hours, then the last hour is going to be all afterbirth.
It's just going to get really random.
We might start expanding into other types of video game things, like video game reviews.
Well, since Under Sedation Live is off air in Sacramento, we can kind of roll over to something more like that show for the last hour.
That could be quite possible.
Possibility.
I don't want to steal, but... One big nerd fest.
One big nerd fest.
I like that.
You know, do anime reviews, or we can have the random reviews.
Like my review of Contra Shattered Soldier.
Yeah.
I know that I probably wouldn't be able to stay until 10, because I need to have a ride right now.
That's because you're... I don't have a license.
Be the overage part of the show.
The legal part.
That's when we all get drunk and smoke crack.
And then in four months, I'll be right here, and I'll stay the whole time.
You've got to bring your own pipe.
Your own crack fight?
Yeah, because we smoke crack when you leave.
That was something else I was thinking about bringing to a... No, no, not smoking crack, but bringing to Shaft was getting some sugar crystals and selling crack at the bake sale.
But it would just be sugar crystals, but I say crack rocks.
That'd be funny.
Orange Lounge crack.
And yes, we're working on the phone call thing, so please stop begging.
It's sad.
We're working on the phone calls.
We're going to be able to take those soon.
And then we've got the new website coming.
We're going to have a whole new season of Orange Lounge Radio before you know it.
It'll be like Buffy.
We'll go on forever and ever.
Yeah, it'll be like Buffy.
We'll kill off Jamie.
No!
And then bring her back to life and introduce her sister she never knew about.
Yeah, made from my genetic material and soul or something, and she's the next Slayer.
And then James Marshall is a nice vampire.
Dude, Spike's hot.
So what exactly would that be like?
Slightly darker shade of hue Sakura?
Yeah.
Grey Sakura.
Dude, no, I'll be like, like, you know, Blacklight Sakura.
I'll glow.
You'll be Rave Sakura.
I need a hug.
Let me give you my shingoku.
Or better yet, you'll be Booty Sakura.
No.
Let me give you my shingoku satsu of love.
There we go.
Well, we got ten minutes left in the show.
Time for all fools to be dead.
Time for you to get a watch.
Time for you to shut up.
Yeah.
Get a watch, slacker.
Let's see.
Did I have anything else on the schedule for tonight?
Nope.
No.
We're going to sit and talk about shit for the next five minutes.
Did you guys hear the fake Legend of Max MP3?
No.
No.
You want to hear the fake one?
Okay, we have the fake one.
We're going to play the fake Legend of Max.
God damn you people that keep trying to spread fake news about Legend of Max.
Or Max on whatever the fuck they're calling it.
DDR Extreme, that's what it's called.
Well, I wanted to hear it the other day.
I knew it was fake to begin with, but I still wanted to hear what Corey came up with.
Alright, let's see.
I might have actually deleted it just because I was like, what the fuck?
Yeah, no one seemed to have it.
It doesn't sound anything like Max.
I can't believe anybody bought it.
We just have to congratulate Cory on his fun hope.
I don't know if I have it.
Uh-oh.
Let me see.
I'm not giving up hope yet.
Don't all send it to me in the chatroom yet or anything.
Yeah, chatroom, don't send it all to him.
Okay, here it is.
We have it.
Alright.
This is fake.
I don't even know what the hell this really is, but this is what they tried to pass off to you as the Legend of Maxx.
Sounds like a big techno-industrial... I feel like raving!
Give me a hug!
Yeah.
Sounds happy hardcore.
When I get an envelope full of light powder, my first impression is... Just snort it!
Well, even if it isn't... GONG!
That's so Asian!
GONG!
Even if it isn't Legend of Max, it's pretty awesome.
I like this song.
I feel like taking my SATs.
Gong!
Smells like dog!
I know I actually never took the SATs.
This is the most repetitive fucking song I've ever heard.
Alright, stop it.
Oh!
There's your freeze arrow.
The big gong.
Gong!
Now you have your... It ain't over till the fat lady sings, bitch!
There's the opera singer.
You know, actually, sadly enough, I want to take this MP3 and make a DWI4, even though it is fake.
I don't give a shit.
Just call it... More repetitive than Sandstorm, though.
It's the D.Va from The Fifth Element.
Sakura sounds more like Max than this does.
Well, hell, I'd rather have it sound like that.
You know, to be honest, I'm kind of sick of Max and Max Unlimited and all the regurgitations of Max.
That would have been a nice change for sure.
I agree.
Speaking of MP3s that are probably fake, Pyro sent this to me before the show.
We all know what that means.
It's supposedly Graduation by B4U, but Lord knows what we're actually going to get when I double-click on this file.
Because Pyroman is our resident prankster in the chatroom.
So this could be a bunch of four-letter dirty words.
It could be the Spice Network, for all I know.
It's going to be like a four-minute fart.
Which would be not too far from what an actual B4U song would sound like.
True.
I made a pun.
Alright, let's see what it is.
This is supposedly Graduation by B4U.
Well, the back singing indicates it's B4U.
Maybe this really is it.
You know what it is?
I think it's Dive Backwards.
Nope, this is actually Japanese.
Jamie's trying to see if she can hear the lyrics.
I swear to God, this is probably just True or Die played backwards.
It's not...
This is legit.
Really?
What are they saying?
I only know or understood like five words of it.
Unfortunately the vocals are a little bit too low for me to hear over the music with as stuck up as my head is.
Well, who knows?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Now what if it was from like a single or something like that?
You never know.
That could possibly be.
Alright, so maybe that was graduation, maybe it wasn't.
You just don't know anymore because there's too many damn people out there spreading fake fakers.
At any rate, it was not a beefy show backwards.
I actually heard a few real words.
Okay.
You missed the voting by about like 10 minutes.
Who was that?
It's the 23rd Magus.
Oh, sorry.
What did he vote for?
He voted for Los Inuerito.
Oops!
That wouldn't have made her break any ties, so no worries.
I can't believe that survived the list anyway.
I should have knocked that one out.
I'm just kidding.
It's because I wasn't going to vote it off because it sounds like Ray Martin.
The thing is, La Senorita in Trick is fun.
It is.
Because of the little skip moves.
You can do that jump and you can jump.
What's your favorite newbie move?
My favorite newbie move?
I think those La Senorita skips are my favorite newbie move.
Either that or the clapping in Macquah.
Um, I would probably have to say that my favorite is actually, and this is a move that I was doing two years ago, my very ever first routine was the butterfly spin.
The butterfly bounce jump.
Alright, you know what I'm talking about, where you have your two jumps, you stomp on, alright, for people who remember the steps for butterfly basic, you've got right foot step, jump, and then you turn around and jump the other way.
but you bounce before you do it and I think it kind of looks neat.
And my other favorite one is the spins on Love To Me where they're like down, up, jump, and then down, up, jump again and you do the spins on them.
Those look cool.
I'm not sure if this is considered a newbie freestyle move or not, but I love the caution drop.
It's so fun.
I love the caution drop too.
I'm really tall, so it's really hard.
But it's fun.
I don't know if that's considered a newbie move or just an 18 freestyle type move or what.
You have to be damn precise to make it look good though.
Yeah, like only a little bee can pull it off well.
I used to do the knee drop on End of the Century.
I thought I was all cool.
I... I... I...
I still do knee drops now, like for my one edit for Ecstasy where it freezes on a knee drop in the center two arrows on doubles.
I stopped doing that because it bruises my knees very badly.
Dude, I still have, okay, this is where I compare scars.
Ab bruise, right there.
For all those who can't see through the radio, she's pointing to her knee.
Wait, I have, um... Dude, you have a scar.
I do?
I do.
Yeah, that's from playing Bakua, my routine, where I scrape my knee because I fell.
I just remember being at Faname last year.
In my Emmy costume, my third mix Emmy costume, doing my favorite Kamikaze drop on Love to Me, back when Love to Me was still kind of cool.
Going out into the hall with blood dripping down my leg from landing on a screw on that fourth plus.
For Shaps, I could do a rehash of my Dynamite Rave routine where I forget my steps about... Dude, that started off so cool.
Fifteen seconds into the song.
He pulls off the trench coat and everyone's like, and then he forgets his steps.
And it's like, crap.
It was so awesome, the beginning of it.
It was like the matrix.
And actually, one of the coolest knee drops I've ever seen was also at the same Fonamay.
A guy I know, Chris, did Dynamite Rave, just as one of the characters from Guilty Gear X, and did the corner knee drop, where you step on the up and right, and then knee drop down to the bottom and left.
Diagonally, that looks really cool.
You know, I actually have a scar on my leg in the exact same place that Dave has one, but it has nothing to do with DDR.
It's from a game of Truth or Dare.
Wow.
Stand by to win.
Wow.
What's going on out there?
Oh, I see.
Oh, my roommate's on the phone.
Too bad we can't broadcast it over the air.
Hi.
This is really good radio.
It's great radio.
You know, I actually, you know, as much as people bitch and complain about it, I miss the old, you know, 18s style moves just because if you do them right, they look so amazing coordinated though.
And true, they're tired routines.
You know, I like watching people do like real dance moves on DDR and that's great and I would prefer watching that for different freestyles since I've judged, you know, a few tournaments before.
But the 18 stuff, when done right, is so clean.
And it looks really good.
I miss the Changos do-it-all-night routine.
Oh, God, no.
I love that.
I don't miss him at all.
I remember, was it his Ninzaburra routine, where he was like, what's that guy who brings out the hammer and squash?
Yeah, he's like the Gallagher of PDR.
Okay, that routine sucked.
Yeah, but he squashed a watermelon in the space.
That still sucked.
Okay.
What was funny about that?
Yay, attention!
Yay, attention!
Look, I'm a whore, give me attention.
Yay.
Anyway.
What the fuck was funny about that?
Okay.
Yay!
We're going to smash a watermelon.
That's why it was funny, because it was random.
It was stupid!
What's the point?
It was random.
It was still stupid.
It's not funny.
That's not something that wins a tournament.
It's like two heads arguing back and forth.
Random, stupid, random, stupid.
Random is good, but only when it's funny random.
I'm sure he didn't enter trying to win with that routine.
It was still retarded.
Speaking of random and stupid, this show is about over.
Well, actually, he won third.
Dude...
Just goes to show what lovely judges you can get at a tournament sometimes, right?
It just goes to show people are easily amused.
Anyways, we should talk about the movie Jackass.
No!
I'll come up later.
Jamie's not going to go see that.
All right.
Final thoughts, Jamie.
Let's start with the cupcakes.
Loki, any final thoughts here?
go check out my website if you haven't www.leachfromloki.tk leave me a request for what 2DX song you want me to make into DWI Next and I'll put it up there that's it Dave I have nothing more to talk about I guess I'll talk about a movie that I want to talk about in the afterbirth not Jackass but until then yeah okay they're talking about stuff
and here's my final thought.
Impressive.
God, my nose hurts.
And my final thought is I need a date.
Thank you.
Date Rob.
That's it.
Thanks for listening.
Stick around.
We've got music coming up for you after the show.
All sorts of crap.
You'll love it.
Stay tuned.
Remember, one and one does not make two.
And that'll be the first song we play coming back.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
What is that?
Jill?
Hi, Barry.
Why on earth are you here?
I'll be examining this.
Barry?
Barry!
I just had something I wanted to check.
I think I'll stay and look around more.
Whoa!
What the hell?
Chris, you're here too?
I think I'm beginning to understand.
That's what I was going to say.
Chris is our old partner, you know.
Hey, we're partners, aren't we?
Let's work together.
Look at this.
Wow.
What is it?
What do you think of it?
Protect yourself.
Perhaps that was the most important part.
Let's go.
Okay, I'll go first.
Sam, it's broken.
Seems like it.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what's going on?
All right, can you do it?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Lost courage already?
I'm sorry for my lack of manners, but I'm not used to escorting men.
Jill!
Let's do it.
Ah, yes.
Barry!
Dibble sandwich.
Right.
Barry, don't screw up again.
Let's go.
Thank you, Barry.
Yeah, yeah.
Is this a meeting room or something?
Is that you, Rebecca?
Yes.
Yes.
Rebecca, can you do it?
Yes, I can!
May I practice for a while?
See?
Just relax and play.
Chris, look at this!
Oh!
Oh!
You like it?
Oh, that was great!
I feel like we're having a secret meeting.
Let's do it!
Chris!
Rebecca!
Look at those monsters!
Well, I think I'll go out and get some fresh air for a change.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
