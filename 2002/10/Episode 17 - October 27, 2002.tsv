68658	75244	I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.
75425	81470	One, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
87552	89773	I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
114184	119989	DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 17 for... You okay there?

141078	141898	You need some Robitussin.
141938	142558	Robitussin!
142578	147520	I almost said that on the pre-show list, except I don't have an editor to cut out all the talk and get me in.
148640	153061	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most shine-get radio station of all things Bomani.
153101	155342	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
155802	159983	Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
160163	161163	You know her better as DarkSakura.
165273	167234	Are you talking, like, out of a box?
167494	171556	Are you talking like the dying man?
172316	172597	No.
173537	177939	Jamie is recovering from ickiness.
178019	179480	We have a whole studio filled with guests.
179520	180620	Let's say hello to our guests.
181040	183281	Actually, they're not even really guests anymore.
183301	184622	They're just, they're always here.
184642	185842	They're the back legs of the show.
185863	186683	They're our mascot.
186703	187463	They're our dancing girls.
187503	188344	They sit behind us.
188724	189944	They're the back legs of the show.
190264	191145	Say hello to Loki.
191165	191245	Loki.
191752	194093	I'm the uncredited member of the show.
194553	195934	You're the guy behind the curtain.
196074	196534	Exactly.
197154	199335	Do not stare behind the curtain.
199555	200556	Nothing to see here.
200656	201236	Move along.
203297	204318	And also Dave.
204338	205078	Say hello to Dave.
205498	206358	I'm just a guy.
207759	210000	I'm just a guy.
210020	210420	What?
210460	212241	You know that No Doubt song, I'm Just a Girl?
212721	213061	No.
213301	216403	Maybe he really is just a girl.
216523	217363	It's one of those evenings.
217383	218924	Sorry, Dave.
219381	224949	We'll be talking to everybody a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a quick break with some songs that we want to play for you.
225370	226852	We have to take the children out for a walk.
229495	230997	Any other opening thoughts from you, Jamie?
234022	234623	I'm mad at you.
235823	237284	I have never heard you crack that high of an octave.
237304	238225	I am mighty impressed.
261138	263479	I have a pretty impressive range, but I keep singing.
263559	263899	I was a fan.
263919	265579	You should go kick Paula Terry's ass.
265619	266119	You could sing.
266139	266660	I was a fan.
266680	267460	You could sing Dive.
267900	270261	I will just take my saxophone and beat her up.
270301	271961	Jamie, I want a Jamie mix of Dive.
275682	277122	There is the karaoke version.
277222	278043	Jamie doesn't sing.
278063	279463	Okay, we're getting a Jamie mix of Dive.
279483	280663	It'll be done on Kazoo.
284378	285078	I can't wait for that.
285738	287299	Alright, we'll be right back.
287319	291720	We're going to take a real quick break and we're going to start with the fuck you's of the week so send those to me over private message.
291740	297202	You've got to be in our chat room and just send those over to Skye, S-K-I-E and then we'll read those.
297242	301904	That'll be the first thing because Jamie's got a lot she wants to say and I'm very, very scared.
301924	302664	What else can I say?
303624	304725	My voice doesn't give up before then.
305765	306525	I can only hope.
306925	307806	We'll see you in a little bit.
308346	308586	Later.
396990	397693	Thanks for watching!
524970	525551	Thank you.
525571	525911	Thank you.
525931	526811	Thank you.
562217	562599	and many more.
623121	626343	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
626923	628183	Orange Lounge Radio.
650291	652494	You leave for a week and everything goes to hell.
652554	653535	And the show goes to hell.
655678	659083	And you know, on top of that, I miss seeing my gay boy action, okay?
659123	659324	What?
659604	660285	I miss Yali Park.
660325	661547	Tell us all about... And I was there.
661567	664050	Okay, tell us all about what you were leaving for...
665071	665511	What the hell?
665531	667753	Somebody's sending their alarm like right outside my window.
667773	676359	Anyway, tell everybody about why you left last weekend, what the plan was that you were going to be gone for, and what ended up making you late and all that.
676499	680942	I was going to go to Yaoi Con because I wanted to go by Dojinshi because, damn it, I'm a nerd.
681923	685445	So Julie says, okay, well, we're going to leave in the morning after my class.
685485	686586	So they canceled her class.
687106	690789	It doesn't matter because Julie still didn't get to my house until six in the evening.
691730	693611	Describe Yaoi for everybody who may not know.
694736	695897	Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove Manlove
722808	725109	I drove by there and I was like, well, that's pretty cool.
726910	727270	Okay.
727551	729251	I think Dark Tetsuya lives by Man Love.
729612	731893	Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just saying.
732533	739237	Anyway, anyway, I was going to go to YaoiCon so I could, you know, look at all the pretty art and watch the pretty anime and see the pretty boys.
740077	742618	And, you know, see cosplayers and stuff.
743279	746440	So we get there and we decide that it's late, so we go to Pacific East Mall.
747841	749062	It's not in Berkeley, but near Berkeley.
749082	749322	Wait, hold on.
749739	752760	Do cosplayers for yaoi like dress up as naked men or something?
752860	753200	No!
755781	756201	God.
756941	757622	Anyway.
758182	765184	So I go and I have this chat with this really nice guy there about the Trueno, because I want one.
766024	774167	For people who have no knowledge of Toyotas or Initial D, it's basically it was the Corolla in Japan, so.
775007	777968	And I want one, and I actually liked the car before I ever heard of the anime.
778792	782515	Anyway, we ended up just hanging out.
782855	788019	Oh, your horn works, you whore!
788079	792622	If that's not picking up over our microphone, somebody's honking the horn quite obnoxiously outside.
793062	794723	Oh, Jamie's going to go do something about it.
800047	801628	God, I hope the mic picked that up.
802309	803870	Jamie just went over to the window and went,
805936	807497	We're trying to do a show!
810439	812841	Anyway, we go hang out at Krista's house.
812921	818384	Actually, we went to San Francisco and picked up Krista, who was working at the convention with a Japanese guest.
821066	821487	What?!
826090	827471	The people outside are screaming.
827511	828211	This is, okay.
828551	829412	We just heard the N-word.
829432	830653	Away from the bad radio.
832345	835626	Anyway, we drove all over San Francisco.
836186	840788	We ate at Mizune and Kintetsu Mall.
842008	842908	Went back, crashed out.
843909	848730	Got up the next day with the full intention of spending the $30 to get into the convention so we could go shopping in the dealer's room.
849751	851931	And, oh, don't forget, pay $15 to park.
852811	853392	I hate that.
853712	856453	Frisco can go to hell and die for costing so much to park in.
856573	860474	Well, we went all over the place and Julie and I sat back and we went, you know what, fuck that.
860999	862560	We decided not to go to YowieCon.
863421	866624	So we went all over the place and spent a bunch of money instead.
866664	868646	And then we walked Krista's dog in Berkeley.
869426	869947	We get back.
870007	872509	We decided that we were going to go to Network Video because we thought we had time.
872629	874090	We didn't realize that we got back at 5.
874130	876633	Network Video being the local import video game store?
877413	878474	Local meaning Bay Area.
879015	880316	We had an hour to get there.
880836	881717	So we get in the car.
882297	883478	We're on our way to Network Video.
884599	887322	We get stuck in evil traffic going into San Francisco.
888274	892358	It took us an hour just to get past the toll booth from Berkeley to there.
893158	895060	I call Rob at, what, 6-something?
895981	897142	Um, Rob, guess what?
897342	898864	We're in traffic at the toll booth.
900165	901686	Going into San Francisco.
902787	907011	So, finally, you know that really weird phone call where, you know, I couldn't hear anything?
907051	910514	That was me calling from Mifune again over my Oyako Donburi phone.
911571	912191	DarkSakura.com
935322	935802	Golden Girls Poster
957310	957550	Yes.
957850	960612	I want a Golden Girls poster and I want some cheesecake.
960632	963213	I need to do my Fuck You of the Week because I have my Fuck You of the Week.
963513	964894	We're getting into the Fuck You of the Week.
964914	965894	Thank you for that nice segue.
965914	966315	Here we go.
968135	970937	Okay, my Fuck You of the Week goes toward JJ North's cheesecake today.
972697	975439	JJ North is... JJ North sounds like... It's like a hometown buffet.
975559	978021	It sounds like a clothing store.
978221	981444	But for people that are back east, it's also like the Piccadilly, basically.
981684	984906	Well, not necessarily like Piccadilly, because that's more of a cafeteria type place.
985327	986347	It's basically a big buffet.
986648	989110	You know, just all kinds of crappy food that's been sitting out for five hours.
990070	993293	Anyway, I hadn't eaten at JJ North in forever.
993833	996455	And Waffle Square, okay, damn them, they were busy.
996956	998157	That should be Chicken and Waffle Square.
998177	998637	Full of old people.
999406	1002628	So, we decided to go to JJ North's because I was actually feeling good today.
1002648	1006090	Because I went home early Friday because I was sick, as you can't tell from my face.
1007031	1008091	Anyway, that was gross.
1009232	1012534	So I go, and I'm all happy because the food sucks and I want a cheesecake.
1012554	1016176	I eat a cheesecake and it tastes like the meringue topping from a lemon meringue pie.
1016196	1016957	It was really gross.
1017977	1018998	And so, that sucks.
1019258	1020939	My second fuck you of the week goes to Rob.
1021840	1023200	For... Yay!
1023421	1026963	Christina sluttier and stuff behind my back on Friday.
1026983	1027063	Okay.
1028072	1028552	Thank you, bitch!
1050812	1054913	We played like a bunch of really... Oh, we played that Legend, the Legend song, the Zelda rap.
1054933	1056133	You know what I'm talking about, right?
1056373	1058614	I'll have to play that tonight for our regular listeners.
1058734	1060695	Oops.
1061535	1062115	We're still on yours.
1062455	1066116	Anyway, yeah, and to intro the Dirty songs, I played Dirty.
1066736	1067936	But it was a chat room.
1067976	1069977	It was a chat room that made me play the full version.
1069997	1073558	Specifically, it was... Specifically, it was SoCalKicks.
1073818	1074958	Not that I'm going to point fingers.
1074978	1076258	SoCalKicks, you can bite me.
1076879	1078019	No GameCube pen for you.
1079321	1080462	You still have to send me proof.
1081343	1084047	And we tried doing the ghetto phone thing on the show, but it doesn't really work.
1084067	1084687	That's okay, chat room.
1084727	1085688	I really love you guys.
1087430	1089893	And you know, I miss you all, but my aim is improving.
1090774	1091455	I practice.
1092176	1092757	Really, I do.
1094098	1098904	My other fuck you of the week goes toward all of you who gave me this cold.
1101061	1107446	You know, this virus, cold, bacteria, needs to die already because I'm getting sick of being sick.
1107927	1108887	You're sick of being sick?
1109668	1110348	Uh, yeah.
1111109	1120817	Um, and my other Fakula League goes toward, um, um, Contra Shattered Soldier because it was really loud and I wanted to go to bed last night.
1123339	1123799	Fair enough.
1124440	1129564	Which, oh, everybody's going to be hearing about that later because it's Konami and damn it, I say so.
1130211	1132832	Okay, do we have any other FUs of the week in the house?
1134133	1134413	Next.
1135393	1136394	Let's move on to Dave.
1138194	1138875	Oh, Loki's next.
1138935	1139455	Yes, Loki!
1140435	1141776	Oh wait, I gotta find Loki's music.
1143096	1143817	Name my song!
1147978	1151280	I have a song for Loki, but I have to find it.
1151900	1154121	Fill in, just start, I'll cue in your music later.
1154561	1156762	Anyways, first FU goes...
1159708	1160290	Please stop.
1160451	1160711	Okay.
1161173	1164284	Anyways, first FU goes to my fucking headache.
1164881	1167362	because my head hurts and it doesn't feel good.
1168203	1171965	Probably from ice training and me staying up until 4 in the morning working on my website.
1172545	1175507	Yeah, so F you to my stupid headache.
1176227	1178908	And also F you to the stupid movie Transporter.
1179369	1181730	God damn it, that movie is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
1183751	1185092	It is a waste of your time.
1185752	1188874	Seriously, it doesn't have any redeeming parts of it at all.
1189314	1190194	It's just crap.
1191451	1193513	Crap Disguise like a good action movie.
1194114	1199719	And also, actually another FU to a movie that's going to be coming out, Extreme Ops.
1200980	1203002	Extreme sports and spies do not mix.
1203303	1204344	Stop trying to do that.
1204584	1205425	What was Triple X?
1207222	1208203	It was Vin Diesel.
1209644	1211525	Oh, he's a beefcake, so it's okay.
1212826	1215387	It was, hey, this is Fast and the Furious as a spy.
1215768	1216428	That's what it was.
1217168	1217769	Extreme Ops.
1217829	1219070	It's a bald James Bond.
1219290	1219770	Extreme Ops.
1219930	1221411	A bald, fat James Bond.
1221591	1227155	These people happen to go up to this, like, lodge, and, oh, there happens to be a terrorist base in this lodge.
1227375	1230377	Who would have thought that there's a terrorist base in this lodge?
1231249	1232990	Wow, what are the odds of that?
1233250	1237453	Oh, it's one of the most notorious criminals, too.
1238193	1240094	Ooh, who would have thought that?
1240154	1241895	What are the odds of that happening?
1245277	1248679	Sorry, could you repeat that for our audience here?
1250700	1251521	I'm sorry, will you finish?
1251541	1253342	Uh, yes, I'm finished.
1253582	1253822	Okay.
1254918	1262221	I don't really have much of a fuck you, but fuck you weekdays for being really long.
1262321	1262961	Oh, it's Giants are one.
1263001	1265182	In the fourth inning was Giants 1, Angels 4.
1279932	1281872	This is not sports talk, this is Ben Mani.
1282033	1284373	Get on with the fuck yous.
1284593	1285593	On with the fuck yous.
1285953	1292235	Anyway, fuck you weekdays for having five of them compared to only two weekend days.
1292915	1298196	Because weekends are cool and weekdays are shit because there is school or work for whoever has work.
1298357	1298897	You know what?
1300557	1306098	All of you people in Japan are lucky because women get one PMS day a month to call in sick.
1307379	1308179	We need that in America.
1309770	1312791	so that I don't have to bitch at people at work and I can just stay at home and bitch.
1313831	1314251	Back to you.
1314792	1315792	Okay, that's it.
1316152	1318133	I'm done.
1318533	1319633	Oh, no, I get one.
1320233	1320833	I get one.
1324775	1329316	My fuck you of the week is the fact that drinking inhibits one's ability just to drive.
1332668	1334008	No, I didn't do anything stupid.
1334849	1339190	But last night I went out to the local bar, the local number one bar.
1340610	1342471	And I was the designated driver.
1342951	1345352	And my two friends I was with were the designated drunks.
1346812	1348273	When I'm drunk, I have a lot more fun.
1348313	1351274	But no, I have to drive, so I can't do any drinking.
1352434	1357436	That didn't stop me from having a pebble shot when we first got there, which, by the way, is Red Bull mixed with Malibu.
1357476	1358496	Very good, you should try it sometime.
1359016	1361657	But of course, since I was there for four hours... Red Bull is the color of piss.
1362324	1363805	And it smells like pussy, what's your point?
1364965	1365326	Okay.
1367607	1372169	So, uh, it took, uh, we were there for four hours, so I wasn't driving drunk or anything.
1372189	1373530	I had plenty of time to get that out of my system.
1373550	1379433	But my two friends, when they get very drunk, they're bold as hell and just, you know, have a lot of fun.
1379473	1380194	A lot, a lot of fun.
1380274	1386597	And, uh, I, uh, I had fun, but I was just kind of just sitting there, kind of, yeah, I'm the driver.
1387878	1388138	Wee.
1389058	1390079	But my costume owned.
1390683	1391583	I don't know if you guys saw my costume.
1391603	1392864	Did you see my costume on my journal?
1393424	1393864	I saw that.
1393884	1394584	That was pretty cool.
1394604	1397225	It was a milk box with the missing and then it went on your head.
1398186	1399006	Yeah, so it was a big hat.
1399066	1401167	It was a big milk carton that says missing and it has my head in it.
1401667	1403528	And I'm sure somebody will post a picture in the chat room.
1403548	1405868	Somebody will post a link to the picture of my Halloween costume.
1406809	1408810	I just had 24 chocolate covered espresso memes.
1409410	1412311	So, my FU is towards DUIs.
1412691	1414672	Do people need to come and help me make my costume?
1415992	1416772	Because I've been lazy.
1416852	1418213	I've had the stuff to make my costume now.
1419133	1421516	Let's get to the chatroom FUs.
1429048	1433730	JB says, F you to Nobody Buying Me the new Jenny Rom single, Ika Uka.
1433870	1434811	Actually, I don't know if that's new.
1434851	1435411	I just said it was.
1436071	1439473	And also to Makeup for Not Coming Off, Stupid Halloween Makeup.
1439513	1440773	You can check it out at his journal.
1441194	1444015	I'm too lazy to give the URL, so he'll have to post that in the chat room.
1444735	1447877	And F you to his math book for having a Spanish glossary or whatever.
1447917	1450418	It made him mad because I couldn't find the English one.
1453489	1453969	Whatever.
1455430	1460652	SoCalKick says, fuck you, Weekend, for being boring as fuck, and funk you, Sky, funk, I said funk.
1461352	1461973	Fuck that.
1462813	1466355	And fuck you, Sky, for superliminally making me expose myself.
1467135	1467835	Okay, whatever.
1469196	1471097	He exposed himself in the chat room.
1474662	1477044	He pulled down his pants and made us cry.
1478165	1480247	Twin says... I'm just kidding.
1480587	1481568	I'm so going to get smacked.
1482309	1489795	Twin says F you to his arcade for having to send the DDR boards and kit to some guy to get it upgraded to Max 2.
1490736	1494899	F you to never being able to get on early enough because of his damn mother.
1495740	1498823	F you to GJBadSite for going completely down for the past two days.
1500564	1500684	And...
1503522	1507325	He has a super secret message for Loki, and then F you to people who watch baseball.
1507966	1510247	Actually, DJ Bad's site isn't down.
1511348	1512509	Just the download section is.
1512969	1514851	He has his GeoCity site still up, though.
1515251	1515331	Woo!
1515491	1517973	Wait, and I don't watch baseball.
1518013	1520956	My parents do, and they're all like, Yeah, it's 4-1 Angels!
1521136	1521616	Or whatever.
1521716	1523057	Actually, they like the Giants.
1523177	1524739	But anyway, that's not the point.
1524759	1525840	The point is I don't watch it.
1526560	1529703	But Loki seems to like it, so... Can I continue?
1530003	1531164	The point is that Cal Expo...
1533288	1534549	Continuing on with the FUs of the week.
1536869	1541151	23rd Magus says, I have a big fuck me to all available ladies.
1541251	1545773	Seriously, my fuck you is to Philips and ATI for making drivers that free step mania.
1545833	1547274	Fuck you mentally deficient coders.
1549315	1549575	Wait.
1551175	1553356	Everybody in the chatroom wants their own theme music.
1553616	1553796	No.
1554056	1554317	No.
1554677	1559719	Pyro Man says, F you to AIM and their goddamn identical windows because of this.
1560731	1561031	Fuck!
1561551	1566254	I just typed, yay, this porno is almost done downloading to this chick I like.
1566654	1568294	Fucking wrong instant message windows.
1568555	1570315	Ugh, I've so ruined my chances with her.
1570575	1573697	That's why you say, ha ha ha ha, that was funny.
1574577	1575978	Ha ha, joke.
1575998	1577158	You want to come over and watch?
1578619	1584162	That's like that cable, or what was it, that beer commercial or something like that where the woman comes over.
1584182	1585962	Hey, is this the adult channel?
1586242	1587063	Why, yes it is.
1588647	1592812	and then, like, you know, they advertise the beer or something like that.
1593312	1596856	Arcadian in the chatroom is indicating DJ Bad might be back up, so go look.
1598218	1598558	Yay!
1599959	1601381	Uh, I already did those FUs.
1601501	1606887	Let's see, DarkTetsuya says, Fuck you to McDonald's for having happy meals of both Transformers and Hello Kitty.
1608128	1608449	Dude!
1608489	1609430	Why is that a bad thing?
1611267	1613569	Oh, that's true, you have to choose.
1614389	1615790	I want the boy kind.
1616970	1617651	Dude, that'd be cool.
1617671	1619872	Dude, I don't... Transforming Hello Kitty.
1619932	1621052	Dude, you win.
1623813	1625834	Dude, anyway.
1626635	1634479	And Black Lab says, F you, number one, to fuck this 1600 word paper that is due tomorrow that he hasn't started on yet.
1634559	1634919	Whoops.
1636214	1641698	Fuck his roommate for missing his train at 8am Saturday, thus ruining his chances for a peaceful weekend to myself.
1642799	1645000	Just Black Lab and his pornography collection.
1645341	1645741	Just kidding.
1646822	1652165	Fuck his roommate again for bringing home some girl last night and making out until all hours of the morning while I was still in the room.
1652986	1655388	Yeah, you don't do that shit with your roommate in there.
1656411	1684182	and you don't do that shit with your roommate I lived in a dorm room, hello you do not have people over making out in the dorm room when your roommate is there you pay your roommate to go play at the arcade unless she's really hot and swings that way, so but anyway you still go somewhere else to make out it's courteous I don't want to listen to two people sucking on each other unless I'm allowed to participate
1686269	1687550	You know, you feel left out.
1692174	1695917	Scorecard.
1700421	1701902	BlackLadsFUs are always fun.
1702243	1702503	Yes.
1703784	1708848	And fuck shitty Verizon brand phones for sucking ass and shitting off at... Oh, shutting off.
1709148	1710730	He left out a vowel, so I put in my own.
1712091	1714233	And shitting off at random times and not hold...
1715486	1715806	That's it.
1715927	1716548	He got cut off.
1716948	1719612	His Verizon phone cut him off.
1722216	1722576	That's it.
1722757	1723738	That's all the chatroom FUs.
1723758	1724279	We're done.
1725801	1726742	No more FUs in the chatroom.
1729065	1729825	Come on, everybody.
1730105	1731746	You can always get up and do the catch-up song dance.
1731906	1732786	No.
1732846	1733066	No.
1733886	1734206	You know what?
1734287	1736567	I actually have a happy fuck you, though.
1736967	1737287	Oh, you do?
1737367	1738148	Oh, you have a happy fuck you?
1738168	1739008	I have a happy one.
1739528	1739928	Let's see.
1739948	1740848	I need happy music.
1740888	1741869	Happy and special.
1742569	1743889	I need happy music.
1743909	1744749	What's happy music?
1745230	1749011	Um... No, I'm not doing it to do Petite Love.
1750051	1751511	Um... Cutie Chaser.
1752112	1752372	Okay.
1754032	1755012	And... Go ahead and start.
1755052	1755713	I'll cue in the music.
1755893	1756433	I don't want dead air.
1756873	1757093	Well...
1758214	1759996	Nintendo has gone and done it again.
1760776	1762778	I am once again addicted to one of their products.
1763519	1765280	Let's hear it for Animal Crossing.
1766481	1773807	I have been coming home worrying about my virtual mortgage and how the hell I'm going to pay it off with fish and bugs.
1775749	1778872	Tom Nook is an asshole and I want Mallory to move out of my village.
1779572	1781213	The fucking duck bitch needs to move.
1781254	1783616	And I hate that bitch Phyllis at night in the post office.
1784256	1786298	Oh my god, they need to gut her.
1787642	1789063	Just do her over an open fire!
1789723	1792124	You're talking about a video game, might I remind you?
1792144	1792684	Yes I am!
1793344	1797946	And dammit, Lobo is cool because he's a big wolf and he's up until 3 in the morning.
1799507	1801328	But fuck you Nintendo and thank you.
1801848	1803569	I love Animal Crossing and I hate you bitches.
1804329	1805670	But I need to play more Kingdom Hearts 2.
1807825	1811828	Oh yes, that's my happy thing is that I'm finally with the times.
1811868	1816492	For those that know me, I am so behind the times when it comes to like regular mainstream video games.
1816812	1819254	I'm just now playing through Final Fantasy X, right?
1820195	1821936	But I finally was able to make a trade tonight.
1821976	1825679	I traded off my 2DX controllers to my neighbor who lives like two blocks up the street.
1825719	1827921	Well, he's not really my neighbor, but he lives two blocks up.
1828622	1830323	And in return I got Kingdom Hearts!
1830403	1832225	So I finally get to play and see what the big fuss is about.
1832245	1833806	You know all the cool kids are playing Animal Crossing.
1833866	1835127	Hello, where have you been?
1835765	1837527	My next fuck you, my fuck you goes to money.
1838107	1840689	Because I don't have enough money.
1860228	1864252	I need more money because I can't afford a GameCube and I can't get Animal Crossing.
1864713	1871079	And Jamie tells me how much fun it is and I get to see how she has all her cute little shirts and stuff and I can't play because I'm poor.
1871299	1877486	He gets to listen to me yell at Mallory because she's a stupid bitch and yell at all the people.
1878146	1882471	And then I did design the coolest outfit and it was inspired by my Gothic and Lolita Bible.
1892044	1893145	I just had a silent moment.
1893205	1893805	Thank you, Rob.
1894265	1894845	You're welcome.
1894865	1896786	Rob totally broke my concentration.
1896846	1898106	Blame him for the train wreck.
1898706	1899326	Fuck you, Rob.
1901807	1903287	So when are you going to do your random shows?
1903327	1904408	I'll buy you more orange balls.
1905328	1905648	Oh, yes.
1905688	1907708	Thank you, Jamie, for buying me big orange balls.
1907868	1909109	I appreciate that.
1909149	1913210	I have some big, fluffy, squishy orange balls, and I put them in my mouth before the show.
1913630	1917431	Yes, he did, but I didn't watch because I had cupcakes.
1918160	1921603	And I had snowballs, so you perverts can, you know, go to hell.
1921623	1922763	Why do they call him Snowball?
1923544	1926566	Because you spit them into your girlfriend's mouth.
1933591	1934212	Yay, random.
1937569	1939189	Go watch Clerks, all of you, right now.
1939329	1940250	You poor, deprived people.
1940410	1944231	I see my buddy Travis joined the chat room, so I want to say hello.
1944291	1945271	I'm glad you're listening.
1945311	1946031	That's so cool.
1946071	1948012	I hope everything's going good for you in Texas.
1948932	1949692	This is for you.
1950412	1956034	The stars at night shine big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.
1957714	1958675	I'm so going to get smacked.
1959215	1960675	Dude, I want to watch Pee Wee now.
1960695	1962756	That's the second Pee Wee reference I've made tonight.
1962796	1963636	That's pretty scary.
1964775	1967037	When I yelled at the people across the street.
1969498	1972200	Yes, the people across the street, by the way, have been quiet.
1973120	1979524	Because the thing is, I would have been inspired again by Animal Crossing by taking my axe and treating them like a tree.
1980265	1981145	And cutting them down.
1982786	1984787	Are you saying that you would have chopped up their booty?
1986809	1988790	Yes, the word of the night is booty.
1989777	1991439	Anything associated with the booty.
1992299	1996062	You say the ass, we say my baby mama.
1996443	2000226	I ain't gonna ask you what the word of the day is again, okay?
2000826	2005991	Listen, bitch.
2006091	2009654	Anyway, that is the word of the evening is booty.
2013717	2015419	At least we're not raving again, okay?
2018078	2019279	Although the raving was pretty fun.
2020679	2021119	I agree.
2021419	2024120	Tell us, what was that remix we heard right before the show started?
2024140	2029223	That mix of Sandstorm and... And Children, the Robert Miles song.
2030343	2036766	This was, I went home after the rave show and decided, you know what, I don't have this song on my computer and I kind of want it.
2037366	2041648	So I went on Kazalite, yay, because it's the only thing that will work with my firewall.
2042588	2044189	And I went downloading Sandstorm.
2044309	2047570	I downloaded one that was called Children of the Sandstorm.
2048069	2048590	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2066260	2068362	It's tentatively Tuesday from what I understand.
2068382	2069503	Game stops are getting there.
2069883	2072065	We're hearing Monday, Tuesday.
2072125	2073105	We're hearing all sorts of days.
2073566	2075327	I have my unopened demo in my purse.
2075347	2078510	Konami is shipping it out this week, and whenever the stores get it, they get it.
2078670	2080391	And then your grubby little hands can go buy it.
2080671	2082393	You know what we could do during one of the later breaks?
2082493	2082673	What?
2082713	2083514	Go put in my demo.
2083874	2087817	You know, the demo you've got is the same demo, but it's synced.
2087837	2088978	Did you actually see it?
2090192	2091173	Have you played that?
2091893	2093333	I haven't seen it.
2093353	2095214	I have the PlayStation Magazine demo.
2095534	2096535	Did you actually see the demo?
2096575	2097795	Yeah, I saw the demo that you got.
2098595	2099116	It's pretty cool.
2099596	2100496	We can go out and hook it up.
2100516	2101457	We'll do that during one of the breaks.
2102217	2103177	Huh?
2103217	2112061	Well, it's the newer version of the demo, because I guess what happened is that the original PlayStation Magazine demo was actually an older version of the demo, and the arrows were all missynced on two of the songs.
2112121	2112641	Isn't that nice?
2113752	2115333	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2136374	2144961	I think this is a really weird thing to have in a home version because most people haven't spent the hundred bucks on an ignition pad and most people don't have metal pads.
2145301	2155550	Most people are playing with those ghetto little pads, either, you know, the, what do they call them, the beat stage pads or what are those things called, the ghetto ones you can buy at Fry's.
2155910	2156511	What are those called?
2157451	2158853	The ass pad.
2158893	2159993	I don't know, the ass pad.
2161635	2165238	You can buy these ass pads and that's what most people play with.
2167867	2168589	Did I say booty?
2168649	2169130	I'm sorry.
2169451	2170172	Ass booty.
2170453	2172718	We're in.
2172819	2173580	Internet access.
2175926	2177530	And yes, the Margaret Cho fans would get that.
2181078	2181418	DeadAir.
2182159	2182920	Oni's Fries.
2183520	2186402	People buy these booty-ass pads at Fries.
2190025	2190506	I'm kidding.
2190766	2194789	Anyway, you play Oni mode on these really crappy pads.
2194809	2204577	You're going to be halfway across the room by the time you finish, and there's no way you're going to be able to keep... You're not even going to be able to pass that dumbed-down-for-Americans Oni, the lesson Oni, or whatever it's called.
2205377	2207658	You're not even going to be able to pass that on most normal homepads.
2207798	2208959	So it seems very odd to me.
2208999	2210119	I thought they do non-stops.
2210159	2212480	I thought we'd have non-stops, but I didn't think we'd have only.
2212540	2213201	I have to admit I'm surprised.
2213221	2217583	Well, this is what we have on the back of the demo, though, for DVR Max.
2217703	2218203	Okay!
2219023	2221524	On one of the images, it has screen capture of the select list.
2221544	2228868	We have healing vision, insertion, let the beat hit him, look to the sky, love again tonight, midnight blaze, paranoia evolution, Orion 78.
2228908	2230408	It says over 70 songs.
2230428	2231149	Yes, over 70 songs.
2236572	2236993	Let me see.
2255600	2256321	I'm just reading this.
2256361	2256701	Let's see.
2257261	2258862	Revolutionary to the max.
2259503	2263605	The evolution of the revolution is here with DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution.
2263986	2271531	Get ready to experience maximum dancing with all new songs and game modes, high energy pulsating music, and stunning graphics.
2272031	2274933	The ultimate dancing game is now revolutionary to the max.
2275993	2282658	Dear Diary, that guy who wanted to be just like a sick was reading the back of the American version of Dance Dance Revolution.
2283721	2286862	Just listening to his voice makes me all excited in special places.
2287622	2288503	Love, Naoki.
2299961	2302822	Actually, I think I've seen that screenshot before about a couple weeks ago.
2302962	2306943	But we can also check that out during one of the breaks and see what's available on the demo.
2307303	2314666	One thing, though, that I did note is that the demo disc is one of the blue CDs, which means it's not DVD.
2314866	2321908	If the last release of Max is any indication, the one that came out for PS2 in Japan, it's also on a CD.
2321968	2327770	So I'm sort of thinking that the new one's not going to be on a DVD, so we may be seeing video sacrifices.
2327810	2328210	I'm not sure.
2328670	2328890	Rob?
2330458	2332901	I think it's going to be on DVD.
2332941	2340593	Rob, I think that you should do the intro and be the announcer for the DDR Max, because you read a lot better than the announcer right now.
2340913	2345400	Hey, Konami, if you're out there listening, I want to be the new announcer, so send me a letter.
2346073	2346513	or something.
2346633	2347053	Shoot me an email.
2347073	2350375	You should just get the guy from Ridge Racer to do it because he sounds like the original announcer anyway.
2350775	2352716	Send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
2352776	2354857	I've got everything on camera so you can watch it again.
2354937	2355877	You're the greatest.
2356597	2360899	SoCalKicks is stamping his foot and insisting that DDR Max USA is on a DVD.
2360979	2361579	It's confirmed.
2361859	2362460	Whatever that means.
2362620	2365401	They need to get Bobcat, whatever.
2365461	2366541	Bobcat Goldthwait.
2366902	2367202	Yes.
2368582	2370223	He would be the best DDR announcer.
2372396	2373297	I think you fucked up.
2373317	2376980	Dude, you suck.
2380483	2383205	Excuse me, but I think you suck.
2386468	2386768	Who else?
2386928	2387729	This is a good topic.
2387769	2389370	Who else would be a good DDR announcer?
2389750	2390411	Bill Cosby.
2392112	2394694	You can play DDR and have a put-in-pot.
2397617	2398858	What about female announcers?
2401778	2428335	Charo, oh my god, that just, that dated you right there, that's like, Hollywood Squares from the 80s is the only thing I ever remember seeing Charo from, and Joan Rivers, oh, Joan Rivers, that would be the best, oh my god, oh my god, can we talk, you're dancing, it's fucking awful, oh my god, talk to my daughter Melissa, what are those shoes, you're wearing shoes with fire on them,
2429946	2430966	Dude, my shoes kick ass.
2431346	2432587	Don't talk about my burning feet.
2434187	2434507	Okay?
2437268	2443730	I could just imagine, though, various other announcers, like, you know, like, Pauly Shore.
2444050	2444871	Good suggestion.
2444891	2446551	Pauly Shore, that's an excellent one.
2446591	2447071	Thank you.
2447472	2449612	Or, like, Keanu Reeves.
2449952	2451153	Dude, you know DDR.
2455114	2457515	Or are Mike Myers doing the coffee talk lady?
2457535	2458395	That's what they're suggesting there?
2460508	2461129	You're dancing?
2461609	2462409	Now I'm eclipsed.
2463410	2464671	Dance amongst yourselves.
2465111	2465751	Here's the topic.
2465791	2466351	Here's the song.
2466391	2469513	Dance Dance Revolution is neither dancing nor revolution.
2469533	2470114	Discuss.
2474196	2474736	It would work.
2476577	2477478	Oh my god.
2477498	2478478	Call me up and talk about it.
2478518	2479839	It's 555-4444.
2479899	2481720	You're dancing?
2482160	2482841	It's like butter.
2485262	2486122	You know, this song here.
2486142	2487363	Why don't you dance to this Barbara song?
2487383	2488524	I heard Barbara do it.
2490691	2492334	Black Lab suggests Carrot Top.
2492835	2493656	Oh my God.
2494257	2495440	Dial down the center.
2499347	2501311	Mr. T, I pity the food and don't play DDR.
2504824	2505725	And who else would we have?
2507165	2507606	Let's see.
2507646	2508346	Who else does good?
2508546	2509567	How about the movie guy?
2509667	2510688	The guy that does all the voice?
2510708	2512909	Mr. Movie Phone.
2512949	2515530	Oh, hello, and thank you for playing DDR.
2516371	2518272	If you would like to play, let them move.
2518392	2519573	Press 1 now.
2519873	2520974	Nobody presses 1.
2521514	2524035	This song is rated R for language and nudity.
2524055	2527898	The only person who presses 1 would be... Doing the copy guy.
2528358	2529499	Alright, DDR.
2529559	2531480	DDR, making copies.
2534617	2537259	Anyway, that was pretty funny.
2537279	2537999	There's still more.
2538280	2538900	I know there's more.
2539460	2539681	Okay.
2540301	2542122	Roseanne could be the female announcer.
2543223	2544724	I can't even do Roseanne right now.
2545044	2546825	What is wrong with your dance?
2548066	2548827	You suck.
2549227	2551148	You dance like you're fat.
2551328	2553710	Margaret, no, Margaret chose mom.
2555571	2556212	Margaret chose mom.
2556232	2556512	Mom!
2556652	2559774	Louis Anderson.
2559814	2560615	Louis Anderson.
2563065	2567126	Your dancing is gay, but I'm not gay, I swear.
2569367	2570327	Okay.
2570687	2572147	I can't do it as good as Travis does.
2572207	2578289	If I try to do Louie Anderson, I feel like I have to throw back to him because he's the ultimate Louie Anderson impersonating.
2578749	2580389	Miss Cleo, yes, thank you.
2582169	2584810	Oh, don't you know you get the first three minutes of dancing for free?
2584850	2585790	It's in the cards.
2585850	2586470	It's in the cards.
2586510	2587731	But you have to pay in advance.
2588811	2589371	Send me all your money.
2591271	2592151	I don't read tarot cards.
2592492	2592952	I read database.
2592972	2596595	Does the chatroom have any suggestions?
2596895	2600678	No, but DSCS says everyone go to Fry's because they have Max USA early.
2601659	2602580	Well, poopy on Fry's.
2602960	2607044	Too bad I already spent five bucks pre-ordering it somewhere else.
2607084	2607764	Yes, thank you.
2607824	2613449	And all of you people who did not reserve your copy at my fiance's GameStop, poopy on you.
2614410	2615471	Unless you don't live in town.
2616111	2616551	Wait a second.
2617052	2618233	They have it out right now?
2619045	2620386	Now everybody's going to run over there.
2620406	2624349	Yeah, maybe they have it, but that doesn't mean they're out on the shelves.
2625210	2627251	Along with AT&T, whose logo is the Death Star.
2628792	2630153	Ooh, I get a sampler CD.
2630233	2633275	I can see what new crap's coming out on PlayStation.
2635237	2635757	Anyway.
2636618	2641461	If the sampler CD doesn't have Animal Crossing or Metroid Prime, I don't want to hear about it.
2641562	2642963	Dude, Metroid Prime.
2643063	2643363	Okay.
2644884	2646125	Forget Mimani for a second.
2646824	2650186	Jamie hates first person shooters, and I love Metroid Prime, thank you.
2651747	2652708	I miss the trash can too.
2654369	2658992	Metroid Prime is the most godly, beautiful looking first person shooter ever.
2659472	2660393	Tell us more about it.
2661173	2662634	It's like... What is it?
2663615	2665236	It's Metroid, but it's like... What do you do?
2665256	2666077	Why do they make it first person?
2666097	2667538	You walk around and shoot shit.
2668358	2669199	In prettiness.
2669559	2670259	Is it like Doom?
2671060	2674182	Kind of, but unlike Doom, it doesn't suck.
2676297	2681779	Okay, here's my sort of fuck you because it really pissed me off last night, but it's kind of a cool thing.
2682639	2683839	Contra Shattered Soldier.
2684219	2685960	It's related because it's Konami, okay?
2686260	2687060	So I can talk about it.
2687660	2689481	Okay, this game is fucking disgusting looking.
2689981	2693202	I walked downstairs with this blaring headache to watch them play the game.
2694199	2697480	and they're beating this bloody turtle up with these guns.
2697520	2698340	They're shooting it to death.
2698660	2702861	Then the head falls off, the thing turns around, and it has this fetus face coming out of its ass.
2702881	2705262	I kid you not.
2706142	2714964	Alright, for anybody who's ever played Vampire Savior and knows the fetus of God level, the face looks like the fetus from the fetus of God level of Vampire Savior.
2716505	2717605	Doom doesn't suck.
2717765	2719165	Did I say Doom sucked?
2719225	2719825	I said Doom sucked.
2720025	2721126	Oh, you said Doom sucked.
2721146	2722086	Doom sucks now.
2723024	2724345	Yeah, Doom sucks now.
2725625	2730268	Doom didn't suck back in... Remember when you used to call into BBSs so you could play four-player Doom?
2730428	2731148	That was the day.
2731488	2732709	Dude, I was playing Doom.
2733589	2733909	Anyway.
2737471	2738632	Well, back to Contra.
2740157	2742379	Yes, I want to hear more about fetus ass babies.
2743399	2748763	It's a big turtle with a fetus growing out of its ass.
2749183	2751245	You mean it's coming out of its booty?
2753146	2755188	It vomits fire on you.
2755988	2757789	Yo, we're gonna go down and play Contra!
2757809	2759810	We're gonna shoot some shit up!
2759930	2770316	There's this other shape that looks like it's inside of some type of muscle cavity that has sinews growing out of the top and bottom.
2770356	2773377	It looks like the inside of skin, and it's dripping blood everywhere.
2773998	2775979	That game is fucking disgusting, okay?
2776699	2778480	And Loki's doing the happy pee-pee dance.
2779625	2780586	Do you need us to go to break?
2780766	2786288	The problem is, you know, with all these good games out, I'm going to be spending about $150 on games this week.
2786729	2795573	And then the fact that I'm not going to work this week to play all these games, that's... You will get your chance to play Contra later.
2796934	2797874	He's going yay.
2798835	2799275	I don't know.
2799855	2803737	I think the last good Contra I remember was the one that was on Super Nintendo.
2803757	2806919	Because didn't they release ones on PlayStation that really sucked?
2807589	2811451	Yeah, and the one on Genesis, though, it was a decent game, but it was really hard.
2812651	2814692	Although the first Contra, this is what's kind of funny.
2815092	2817634	The first Contra, you know the palm trees in the first stage?
2817874	2820115	On the Japanese version, they were animated and the game had an intro.
2822056	2822696	It was pretty neat.
2823716	2827618	You know what really has me torn is that this week there's a couple new albums coming out.
2827658	2829379	There's the new Toriyamis albums coming out.
2831184	2832625	Yes, everybody loves Tori Amos.
2832925	2834026	I love being female.
2834406	2835727	Especially me.
2836167	2836627	I can't wait.
2836667	2839629	I get to hear 20 more songs about somebody's vagina.
2839649	2840270	No, I'm just kidding.
2840690	2841751	She doesn't sing about her vagina.
2841771	2843652	But most people assume that.
2843672	2844412	But she does eat my pussy.
2844973	2845553	That's true.
2845593	2848995	There is that recording I have where she told some guy at a concert to eat her pussy.
2850156	2852417	And then, God, what else comes out this week?
2852457	2853898	I think there's another big album coming out.
2853938	2854559	I can't remember.
2856385	2857606	I never keep up with that.
2857726	2860227	I'm busy stuck on my computer and playing DDR.
2860247	2862228	Because I play to DDR.
2864850	2865950	That new Dance Mania album?
2868272	2868652	I don't know.
2868692	2870053	I think it came out on Friday, actually.
2870073	2871193	The inside of this is blue.
2873374	2874335	With meat fire on it.
2874995	2878737	I'm looking in the inside of my demo disc case because I finally opened it and I've had it for two weeks.
2879398	2880298	You're just now looking at it?
2880518	2880778	Yes. 75%
2884932	2890097	Well, supposedly they ripped it out of the promo.
2890417	2892399	Oh, I remembered what CD was coming out this week.
2892759	2893019	What?
2895942	2896322	No!
2901387	2904169	Okay, I need to go vomit violently.
2904669	2906151	So we're going to break right now.
2907248	2909332	and I'm going to regurgitate and rob shoes.
2910834	2913117	I'm going to get my ass beat during this next break.
2913138	2915081	Uh oh, you said it.
2915121	2916903	You're going to kick my booty.
2925882	2926823	Alright, we're going to go to break.
2926863	2931488	I'm going to start this break with something that Dave's been begging me to play all night long.
2932869	2936353	And it's going to make Jamie cry, but as long as we're on her bad side, hey.
2937654	2940077	This song makes both me and Duran Duran cry.
2940457	2940818	Hello.
2941558	2943000	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2959919	2968962	I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the door to W What is happening?

3478180	3481241	and Jamie's throwing a fit because... They're raping my demo.
3481341	3482941	There were no new songs in the demo.
3483061	3485661	It hadn't been in the old demo, which kind of... But they're synced.
3486101	3486762	They are synced.
3487522	3487882	In sync.
3487922	3488662	They are in sync.
3489462	3490362	Bye, bye, bye.
3492423	3493363	No, I have names for them.
3493423	3494543	It's in sync in 98.
3494623	3499684	Loki and Dave are back there trying to see if they can get Max 300 in the demo, which I told them they wouldn't be able to.
3500084	3500844	And... Nope.
3501104	3501504	I knew it.
3501604	3502104	I knew it too.
3502144	3503165	I was sitting there walking.
3506437	3507038	What can you do?
3507598	3508639	Are you playing with a ferret?
3512342	3515025	Oh, I'm supposed to talk about... Crap!
3516246	3516566	Booty!
3518468	3518708	What?
3519169	3519509	Booty?
3519709	3520049	Booty.
3523312	3524273	Give me my demo, bitch.
3525174	3526095	Give me my demo.
3528183	3529523	I need my blue disc shininess.
3529583	3533605	I was supposed to talk about what I showed you guys during the very opening break of the show.
3534345	3536786	SoCalKicks is helping us work on a new website.
3537466	3539906	And I showed it off to everybody in the room during the first break.
3540407	3541567	And it's pretty so far.
3542047	3543868	So we can't wait to see the finished product.
3543908	3544468	So hurry it up.
3544608	3545208	I'm just kidding.
3545468	3545968	It's orange.
3546288	3547729	I love getting other people to do work for me.
3548429	3548849	Thank you.
3549729	3551070	I take back my fuck you, by the way.
3553991	3554511	Give me a dollar.
3554531	3555591	It was moving.
3577065	3577666	Yes, it was.
3577746	3579267	It was like a bowel movement.
3580568	3583330	Dave, I'm supposed to give you a special hello from Rai Rai.
3583531	3584451	She's listening right now.
3586293	3586573	Hi.
3587714	3588295	Yes, hi.
3588375	3589255	He likes cheese, too.
3593199	3593759	Let's see.
3595581	3596962	What else is there to talk about today?
3597622	3599544	Let's do a sim update from Loki.
3599684	3602827	Let's hear all about what's going on in the sim world.
3604529	3604970	Nothing.
3605651	3606873	No, there's lots going on.
3606933	3607414	The truth.
3608897	3610279	Yeah, a ton of stuff's going on.
3611061	3612563	Let's start with the obvious stuff.
3612884	3613485	Step Mania.
3615889	3616550	No ferrets.
3617739	3618920	are part of the Sim Update.
3619940	3626584	Okay, anyways, Step Mania 3 Final has finally been released, so everyone go enjoy that.
3626684	3638851	They have, of course, Para Para support and Easy to Dancer support and Pump It Up support, so it's just a bit more than just DDR, so go try that, and their editor kicks ass, they use it for everything.
3639991	3646013	Aside from that, DJ Bad's site is of course down at the moment.
3646273	3649714	Actually, it's because Music Gaming Zone's site is down.
3651014	3654935	Because he was using them as an affiliate, he's down as well.
3656175	3658636	Not too bad for that because I needed their files.
3659796	3662317	Also, there's also my site.
3663217	3667378	If anyone has been reading any of the boards lately, I've announced that I'm doing a project
3668418	3672441	where I'm making a DWI for every single Beatmania 2DX song out there.
3673822	3677224	So that started off pretty good so far.
3677244	3679466	I've been averaging about one song a day.
3680446	3683268	Right now I've got three of my originals up on my site.
3683348	3688932	I've got Love is Orange, The Sound of Goodbye, and of course another one for Sakura.
3689072	3689833	I have one of those.
3690673	3692574	Plus I'm hosting some files for other people.
3692594	3695136	I've got VJ Army by Moogle Hunter.
3695877	3697037	And there's a couple other...
3698283	3699004	Files up there.
3699024	3699865	So go check it out.
3699946	3704713	It's www.leachfromloki.tk So go check that out.
3704793	3705494	It's pretty awesome.
3707054	3707694	Yeah, good shit.
3709114	3711535	Other than that, really not too much going on.
3711915	3716356	There's about 4 billion files out there for Sakura, so if you don't like mine, go play someone else's.
3718036	3718737	Pretty much it.
3718777	3719597	Go play someone else's.
3719837	3721517	If you don't like my stuff, too bad.
3721537	3721897	Exactly.
3722337	3727659	Other than that, DDRPC, they released a nice Halloween-themed set of characters.
3728179	3728739	They have one guy...
3730037	3738142	Hey, I like the one character and it looks like Jack from... They're cool, but just DDRPC is kind of... Alright, DDRPC sucks ass.
3738782	3740944	The only reason I play DDRPC is because of the characters.
3741324	3744306	The only one that anyone really pays attention to is... Pantless Rage.
3745586	3749129	Yes, if they had Pantless Rage, I'm sure it would get everyone's attention.
3750129	3752370	And Titless... Three-Titted Emmy, was it?
3752791	3754372	Three-Titted Emmy and Pantless Rage.
3754392	3754692	Yeah.
3755419	3756561	from a long time ago.
3757362	3758343	How long ago was that?
3759364	3760506	Episode number seven.
3760846	3761867	Pretty sad I know that, huh?
3762768	3764210	Black Lab would like to hear from the ferret.
3764250	3766193	Says we need to give the ferret some air time, so go for it.
3773482	3774203	That was the ferret.
3774494	3776895	and now Jamie and I have something else to get out of our system.
3776915	3778736	So cute!
3779016	3779617	So cute!
3779637	3779937	So cute!
3780417	3787921	We're looking at a picture of the guy I used to host Under Station Live with, Travis, moved to Texas and Jenna's in the picture.
3787941	3788161	Jenna-chan!
3788181	3789242	It's so cute!
3789462	3790102	I'm so happy!
3790802	3791803	Oh, it's so cute.
3791823	3792543	It's so cute.
3792603	3793284	Twin, no.
3793364	3794564	No four-titted sky.
3794704	3795084	Jesus.
3795545	3796225	What?
3796985	3797686	Oh, God, no.
3799947	3800808	The parent likes the idea.
3800928	3804011	Now that we got that squealing out of our system.
3806774	3809676	JB says, oh, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I'm going to.
3809756	3812459	He's working on the graphics officially for Step Mania's PPP mode.
3813735	3813975	Winner!
3813995	3814716	From local input.
3814976	3815216	Winner.
3815557	3816518	Parapara's cool.
3816958	3821062	Then we can finally do a Parapara to stuff like my baby mama.
3821763	3829510	Actually, that's one cool thing about the Parapara support, is it has the drivers built in for the actual controller, so if you have a Parapara controller out there... Which I do not.
3829810	3832032	And a USB port, you just plug it in and it works.
3832052	3832453	I have one.
3832933	3833514	So it's awesome.
3833534	3834395	Plugging it in and in and in.
3835155	3836036	So, yeah, look for that.
3836056	3836757	I bought it from George.
3837679	3838659	Go download it now.
3838700	3843642	I know it's sometimes... Oh yeah, DWI, well, they're still at version 2.03.
3843962	3848644	They've been at 2.03 for like months now.
3848884	3850465	I think DWI is dead.
3851425	3851806	We don't know.
3851826	3855868	They could come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden, you know, it could be DWI Extreme.
3856228	3857588	They're playing catch-up right now.
3858149	3858809	It's pretty bad.
3860950	3861450	Catch-up.
3862050	3863131	They're playing catch-up.
3864133	3865654	No, I'm not going to play the catch-up song.
3866034	3867696	Do the dance in your little mind, Dave.
3868696	3869117	Please don't.
3872059	3872499	Exactly.
3875101	3878883	Speaking of DDR Extreme, any other new news that we're finding out about that?
3878903	3884928	I know there were some pictures that came out, and basically it just looks like Max 3, so I have no idea why they bothered to change the name.
3885008	3890652	For anyone who has a live journal and is interested, there are people who are giving random updates now and again
3891753	3893054	LiveJournal.com
3912871	3916096	They're coming out, they're bringing back a lot of old songs that I've noticed.
3916857	3919682	As well as, as long as a bunch of really good ones.
3919702	3921985	The whole thing is that they're just starting a new engine.
3922125	3922927	That's just what it is.
3923027	3925350	It's just, they're just changing names.
3925370	3925691	That's it.
3926754	3928155	Yeah, Max was a new engine.
3928235	3930156	I mean, it was Max and Max 2, and now Max 3.
3930356	3931736	So are they still tweaking it?
3931756	3932717	Max was a new engine.
3932737	3934177	It had the full motion video.
3934197	3935138	It had the freeze arrows.
3935618	3936958	It was different enough to be in the name.
3936978	3937779	So what is it going to do?
3938139	3939780	It's extremely not different.
3939800	3940660	Vibrate or something?
3941140	3943181	Going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings?
3943201	3943621	It's green.
3944241	3945462	Dual shock dance pad.
3946138	3949343	It's going to give you happy, joy, joy feelings in the special places.
3949363	3955012	The only real announcements that they made is a few of the songs that were only in the only modes are playable.
3955172	3956575	Like Jet World, that was one of them.
3956895	3957336	At least 100 seconds.
3958484	3967052	My fiance said something Whenever they come out with a game series and they release an extreme version He says that means it's the nail in the coffin
3981264	3984887	And you know, from what I've been hearing, DDR is a dying game.
3984927	3986388	DDR is dying.
3986408	3991511	But as I told Dan, lately it's been that if it's the last one, it's going to be the final.
3991671	3994273	So I don't think this is DDR the final yet.
3994653	3995334	Nope, not yet.
3995414	3996495	I don't think it's the last one either.
3997315	3999597	I don't think they've milked every single cent out of it they can yet.
4000037	4006261	And with Max coming out in the USA being pretty much, agreeably, the best home release on any system yet.
4007562	4008543	Matt's hand shot up in the air.
4009898	4017684	Actually, I was just going to mention something that, you know, you're mentioning Max and stuff and kind of DDR becoming more well-known and stuff.
4018484	4026490	On Thursday, Halloween, okay, they're going to have, actually, it's going to be on CBS this morning.
4026750	4028832	I think it's like the morning show, CBS morning show.
4029612	4043980	They're going to be doing exhibitions for DDR on the show live, and they're going to be covering it throughout the whole show, which will get a lot of publicity, at least out there.
4044860	4046901	Too bad it's in New York, otherwise that'd be fun to go to.
4047782	4050063	That means there's only going to be like five people who play good.
4050962	4053383	I don't know, there's a pretty good... You're nice.
4055204	4065248	No, actually, there is a pretty good DDR community in New York, and I found this out after, you know, having to keep an eye on the New York thread for a while.
4065288	4073972	But, you know, I've actually seen a few of the people from New York play, at least in videos and things, and there's a pretty good crowd there, so I'd really look forward to seeing that.
4074252	4076253	Wasn't somebody from here playing out there?
4076273	4078474	Or is that happening?
4079355	4079735	Who, what?
4080782	4083024	I thought it was DJ 8-Ball that was going up there.
4083164	4084705	Aren't they going to have to letterbox Ezekiel?
4086106	4087227	No comment.
4088347	4090669	I'm sorry, was that my outside voice?
4090689	4091069	I'm sorry.
4091530	4091850	Anyway.
4092811	4093731	That's not nice.
4094452	4097514	We're a nice, friendly radio station, goddammit.
4098995	4099295	Aren't we?
4099776	4101637	We're fucking wonderful people.
4102198	4105520	We're nice, caring, wonderful, goddamned people.
4106320	4106941	And you love us.
4107681	4108182	Worship us.
4110209	4111991	Black Lab says Nobody Jen will be there.
4112912	4114774	Yes, she's a member of RTF.
4115355	4117217	I haven't met her, but I've heard very good things about her.
4117657	4117838	Yes.
4118819	4119700	Cool.
4120461	4129271	Except there's parts of her... I'm not going to comment on that, because I commented on that when we made suggestions for what would be scored on in the Shaft tourney.
4130092	4130312	Okay.
4132094	4134976	I'm sorry, but... And she's really good for freestyle.
4135376	4138879	But how is it going to score you points with judges by grabbing your boobs?
4139299	4140520	Okay?
4141500	4142521	As part of her routine.
4142981	4144242	I'd like to make a comment on that.
4144262	4144863	Shut up!
4145363	4146344	Give me that microphone.
4146964	4148025	You are not a host.
4148085	4149206	Give me the microphone.
4149246	4151687	That heavily weighs on score, I believe, man.
4152348	4155190	Grabbing one's boob is not a show of talent.
4155250	4160033	If I grab my boob in the middle of a freestyle routine, will you give me a hundred...
4161676	4163737	Now, I said it didn't count for you.
4163897	4166517	It might count against you, but I said it scores heavily.
4167978	4168378	Depending.
4168778	4168958	Yeah.
4169638	4171078	What if my boobs aren't very heavily?
4171598	4177120	A person should be judged on how well they perform not grabbing your boob.
4177500	4178520	Hey, that's performance.
4179780	4181601	Yeah, maybe in a strip club.
4181781	4187262	But then, like, all the cheerleaders on the NFL teams and all the professional sports teams would get fired.
4188422	4190103	But what if you grab your boobs on mirror mode?
4190123	4190883	Then you're really fucked.
4194584	4195945	You remember the whole mirror thing?
4197646	4201209	You know, I believe that was a year ago today was SCAT.
4201689	4202650	October 27th, right?
4202690	4203370	Yes, it was.
4203410	4204351	Yes, a year ago today.
4204391	4207794	We were having our show on the anniversary of...
4208965	4213426	The Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament, where we had four people cosplay.
4214286	4215386	But they were all very good.
4215686	4219347	Yes, we had Ryan running around in his Afronova costume.
4219387	4221408	And it was funny because Ryan didn't even try to enter.
4221468	4224608	He just happened to dress up like the guy from Afronova.
4224948	4226669	And then he's like, hey, wait, cosplay?
4226729	4227029	I'll enter.
4227049	4228369	Yeah, it was pretty cool.
4229729	4232650	And we had, who else was there?
4232690	4233050	Fiona.
4235288	4239670	Dr. Hikaru, who, because we're nice, we're not going to comment on her.
4240571	4241711	Yeah, great, cosplay, wonderful.
4241731	4251816	She had a really nice Milia costume, Milia Rage from Guilty Gear X. We had Jossie in her petite carrot, her puchiko outfit.
4252757	4255738	And then we had, of course, Ryan Zafranova costume.
4256218	4261201	And then we had Satsuki as Devilzuki, who Travis interviewed.
4261929	4262770	DarkSakura.com
4278041	4278922	I don't want sprinkles on mine.
4279022	4280943	Those interviews were hilarious.
4281243	4282223	I want them very bad.
4282263	4286485	I wish he would... That's a bummer about him being in Texas, too, is now he can't do our Shaft interviews.
4286545	4289887	But that's okay, because we're going to have Orange Lounge, hopefully, streaming all day long.
4290167	4290387	Oops.
4291348	4291608	Oops!
4292088	4303114	Yeah, it was funny, because I remember he gave, like, a little sex quiz to all the people that he interviewed, except Dr. Hikaru, because he was scared of what she might answer as, like, for some of the answers he gave.
4303954	4304514	Yes, please.
4307412	4309012	No, we are not here.
4309372	4312753	Like I said, we are nice, goddammit, and we are going to behave.
4312793	4314014	We are fucking wonderful people.
4314034	4315314	We're going to behave like degenerates.
4317594	4318155	Next, please.
4319375	4322956	So, anyway, I guess... Travis wants to know what the hell I'm talking about.
4323256	4325216	I think he just heard me say his name and he suddenly woke up.
4325856	4329117	Since we're on the tournament discussion subject, though... Yes.
4330437	4336839	Everyone, go to sakbemani.com, click on the link for Shaft...
4338284	4339204	Go get some Shaft!
4339224	4340265	My head hurts.
4340285	4340845	Yeah, tons of prizes.
4340865	4340886	I...
4361232	4370999	It's so much so that in order to not look strange, you know, leaving work with like box loads of DVDs, I'm going to have to like smuggle them out of my work like one box at a time.
4371139	4373680	Yeah, one box at a time, like 50 DVDs per day.
4374281	4377043	I mean, it's crazy.
4377403	4378284	Yeah, that's right.
4378324	4379524	He said 50 DVDs per day.
4379604	4382647	So the door prices at SCAT, or I'm sorry, at Shaft...
4383627	4385288	Almost everybody's walking home with something.
4385368	4389331	You know, we go to so many tournaments and people are always like, well, the same people always win.
4389611	4391472	Well, if you show up, everybody's a winner.
4392613	4393053	Just about.
4394033	4394894	While supplies last.
4395600	4399241	We are also assuming everything works out properly.
4399741	4402782	We are going to have a demo of DDR Max, the USA one.
4403122	4404142	Yes.
4404582	4408323	We are also, you know, we've been having these meetings.
4408763	4410844	Basically, the tournament is in two weeks.
4410884	4414945	We're having, I've talked to a couple people who are coming from out of state, which is going to be good.
4414965	4416525	We're going to have a big turnout for this.
4417925	4421346	You know, Scandia has really been wonderful in helping us.
4421466	4424547	We are having, we're having a bake sale.
4425339	4431240	If you want to contribute to the bake sale, bring us your... I'm making arrow cookies for the bake sale.
4431280	4432301	We need pro cookies, too.
4432561	4433281	And afro cookies.
4433301	4434101	We need the afro cookies.
4434841	4439562	And, you know, we have Rice Krispie treats with, you know, little Beat Mania... We're going to have Beat Mania bars.
4439942	4441122	Yeah, we'll have Beat Mania bars.
4441803	4450384	You know, if anybody wants to be in on the fun, you know, bring us your... We should, like, get pineapple and cut them into arrows, and then we can have some fruity paras.
4451265	4451365	Oh.
4451985	4452685	Ha ha ha ha.
4454673	4454993	DarkSakura.com
4480191	4483899	including the possibility of an orange lounge chair.
4483959	4485121	Yes, we're looking into that.
4485602	4487426	Seeing if we can get that to happen, an orange lounge chair.
4488327	4489089	We're trying to make that happen.
4490631	4499677	But the tournament's going to be big, you know, for any of you who can't afford to fly out from whatever country or potent county you live in, feel free to.
4500197	4501098	We like company.
4501198	4507521	You can take a plane, you can take a train, you can take a bus, you can take a boat, you can walk.
4508702	4510103	And if you're walking, leave now.
4510223	4514626	And if you happen to be a paraplegic, you can squirm.
4516201	4521325	DJ Morpheus says every 10th person there can get a free bottle of Kaboom
4538325	4538665	Winner!
4540086	4540706	Alright!
4540726	4541306	Kaboom!
4541366	4542186	The new orange!
4543307	4544367	Dude, I'm going to put that in the orange.
4544407	4545207	Thank you for the idea.
4545227	4546048	Thank you for the idea.
4546068	4547168	I'm going to put some kaboom in the back.
4547188	4551229	We need to get little red bouncy balls and give them out as happy fun ball.
4551549	4552030	It's happy.
4552110	4552690	It's fun.
4552810	4553670	It's happy fun ball.
4554190	4555591	We're going to give bouncy balls.
4555611	4557251	We're going to give you balls.
4558972	4560913	They didn't even come to the tournament because I say so.
4562193	4562793	Come or die.
4564034	4565314	Skate or die!
4566615	4567675	That's dating you now.
4569180	4570521	I had my Charo reference.
4571802	4573643	Alright, we're going to take a break.
4574864	4576825	And when we come back, what are we going to do?
4576845	4577925	Are we going to talk about something else?
4577945	4579466	Are we going to do a list list?
4579566	4580047	List list.
4580307	4581027	List list for what?
4581648	4582388	We'll think of something.
4582448	4583209	We'll think of something.
4583269	4587451	Okay, this might be a long break while we think of what list lists we're going to do.
4588031	4590293	But a surprise list list when we come back.
4591573	4593515	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4593535	4595036	I'm actually looking for a song to play.
4595256	4595816	Play something.
4595976	4596336	Anything.
4596757	4597297	Like Kuchaka.
4600393	4601934	I don't have Kachaka, dammit.
4602695	4604896	We are all hopelessly addicted to Kachaka.
4604917	4607258	I'm looking for... Even those of us who haven't been able to pass it yet.
4607278	4608459	I'm looking for at least 100 seconds.
4608479	4609280	I can't find it.
4609340	4610601	Because I said we'd play that this break.
4611601	4611942	Shit.
4615685	4616485	I know what we can play.
4618146	4619187	Let's play the song.
4620048	4622750	Let's play something that we played on Friday night's fucked up show.
4622810	4623710	We're not playing Dirty.
4623771	4624711	No, we're not playing Dirty.
4625852	4626733	And we'll play...
4628959	4630041	I don't have Kataka!
4632085	4633127	We'll play some other shit.
4633467	4633748	Enjoy.
4671759	4672563	Thanks for watching!
4715892	4716594	Thanks for watching!
4767674	4768336	Thanks for watching!
4883593	4890029	Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy Wedding Happy New Year, Happy New Year, I say to you every night
4928936	4929656	Thanks for watching!
4962481	4971930	I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll say to you every day I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be waiting
4989828	5000777	I feel you, I feel you, I feel you, everybody I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me I feel you, I feel you, I feel something in me
5189130	5196739	When's the next time that we're gonna take out the remote kit and tape some shit?
5207401	5209763	I guess Shaft, really.
5210023	5212844	Hopefully, if it all goes well, we'll be doing a test next week of this.
5213145	5214545	We're going to be doing the whole day.
5214846	5221990	Orange Lounge broadcast is going to just broadcast straight from the Scandia Golf Course all day for those of you guys that can't make it.
5222010	5224551	We'll also rebroadcast it for those of you guys that are there.
5224912	5225672	I want to hear it later.
5225712	5227013	We'll rebroadcast it at some point.
5227653	5228874	At least in bits and pieces.
5228894	5231676	What do you mean the whole day?
5232096	5234177	We're going to be broadcasting the tournament all day.
5234197	5236318	We're going to broadcast the tournament all day long.
5236739	5236839	And...
5238149	5240830	Oh, I thought you meant like just having a normal show next week all day.
5241470	5241950	That was weird.
5242510	5251151	And since Jamie and I are going to kind of be busy with tournament stuff, I'm going to be out there doing a lot of the MC stuff, and Jamie's going to be running around like a chicken with her head cut off.
5251171	5252432	We should have junior hosts.
5253392	5255212	I'll only be able to get on the stream.
5255232	5256032	We'll call them our cupcakes.
5256052	5257433	Yes, our cupcakes.
5258753	5263054	Tal will be emceeing some of it, and I'll be in the... Oh, he might be.
5263654	5264354	I don't know what's going on.
5265074	5265354	Whatever.
5265674	5268815	From what I'm told, Tal will be doing part of it or something, depending on what's going on.
5268835	5269955	Yes, we definitely would appreciate his assistance.
5271396	5273836	And I can get on the stream while that's going on, do some interviews.
5274416	5277437	And in the meantime, we'll probably get Loki on there.
5277497	5279798	Some familiar faces have been on the show in the past.
5279858	5281398	Maybe Brad and Irene will be doing some interviews.
5281578	5282878	How can you hear my face?
5284399	5285859	Some familiar voices, then.
5286299	5286599	Yes.
5286999	5288040	We'll be doing all the interviews.
5288060	5288980	The silhouette of my mind.
5289480	5289620	So...
5291370	5293711	List List is the best song in a DVR 3rd mix or 3rd Korean machine
5310654	5318758	and we are basically leaving it at that so that in the future we can have second mix as an option and fourth mix as an option and etc.
5318838	5322460	So let's start with the most special person in the room, me.
5322680	5335387	If you want to contribute to this list, basically we're going to name our top three best third mix stuff and then we'll have a big list and then each one of us gets to remove an unworthy song from the list.
5336348	5340356	and then the chat room gets to decide on the final list.
5340436	5340977	Yes, Dave?
5341398	5343582	And if anyone says Dynamite Rave, they get punched.
5344384	5344945	Punch!
5345346	5346168	Don't punch!
5349471	5351832	I'm waiting to give the mic back to Rob.
5351852	5352753	We'll let Rob start.
5352833	5353133	I'm here.
5353754	5354554	Why do I have to start?
5354574	5355355	Because I said so.
5355875	5357056	I guess because I never start, huh?
5357216	5357416	No.
5358256	5364080	Oh, I'm also supposed to give a really quick announcement before I, because I'm cleaning out my PM windows and anticipation list list.
5364200	5369843	23rd Magus wants any locals in Sacramento or Bay Area, I guess, to go to Scandia and bring your costumes.
5370444	5374146	I don't know if there's going to be a contest or anything, but I'm just supposed to give that announcement.
5375669	5377070	It's a get-together on Halloween.
5377870	5379210	Get your Halloween DDR on.
5379310	5380151	Get your spooky on.
5380591	5381691	So give us your number three.
5381731	5383432	Alright, I'll go first because I never go first.
5384632	5391975	My number three choice for best freaking third mix stuff is Flashdance.
5392895	5394336	Flashdance fucking owns.
5394556	5395056	Yes, it does.
5395496	5398177	It was one of the first songs I ever played on the actual third mix machine.
5398197	5398598	Dave.
5399378	5399678	Dave.
5401067	5405669	Oh, okay, I was going to say that that was my first song that I did on double.
5406409	5408050	And it was a four, actually, but I failed.
5408670	5411191	Oh, okay, um... Actually, I failed the first time I ever played it.
5411651	5411931	Yeah.
5412672	5413532	Uh, this is tough.
5413772	5414912	I've got, like, six choices.
5415393	5418074	Okay, I'll go with the Boom Boom Dollar KOG mix.
5418554	5419794	Boom, boom, boom, boom.
5419934	5420675	Because that's cool.
5421355	5423076	And the trick one is really cool.
5423636	5424096	KOG.
5424736	5425997	Whatever.
5426777	5428398	And... Oh, sorry, KOG's...
5431021	5431862	Big fucking deal.
5431942	5432302	All right.
5432542	5434043	Yes, Loki, your number three choice.
5435104	5436925	It's gotta be Do It All Night.
5437146	5438146	Do It All Night!
5438406	5438707	Oh, yeah.
5440368	5442349	I'm glad you put that on your list, because I didn't.
5443510	5446693	My number three... Save the best for last.
5446753	5447393	Ladies last.
5448154	5448614	...is Face.
5449134	5449595	Face.
5451856	5452477	Awesome song.
5452937	5454138	Face is pretty fucking cool.
5454518	5454799	Okay.
5455600	5460263	My number two pick for best song on a third mix machine, If You Can Say Goodbye.
5460543	5461304	That's a good song.
5461404	5462104	I love that song.
5464386	5467287	If You Can Say Goodbye.
5467347	5468828	But the song is freaking amazing.
5468848	5469929	The song's freaking rad.
5470209	5470549	Your turn.
5470930	5472831	And it's one that most people forget about, but it owns.
5473611	5480376	Okay, my second choice is Song Suck, because I love the little thing in the middle.
5480536	5481917	Song Suck, Song Sucks.
5482477	5482577	Wow.
5485549	5486169	Yes, Loki.
5488310	5489471	No one can forget this.
5489851	5490511	Afronova.
5491232	5492312	Afronova.
5495493	5496674	The song is fucking gay.
5497734	5499635	The song is fucking gay.
5500796	5501276	Caution.
5501636	5502176	Caution.
5503857	5510040	Just because I can sit and listen to that song on repeat for a full hour and not even realize it.
5510060	5510460	Caution.
5510560	5511560	Most people know it as caution.
5512941	5514762	My number one choice...
5515615	5516135	Drumroll please.
5516475	5517136	Drumroll please.
5517256	5517556	Please.
5517596	5519176	I'm sure you all know this by now.
5519516	5522617	My number one song is Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.
5522897	5523698	That song owns.
5525498	5527279	Yes, because Rob is our erotic whore.
5528139	5528980	Fucking love that song.
5529100	5529400	Alright.
5530020	5532241	That was the song that really got me hooked on DDR.
5532281	5533421	So give it it's credit please.
5533481	5534882	Especially with karaoke mode.
5536122	5536402	Okay.
5536882	5538663	My number one choice is Beautiful 21C.
5538743	5540043	Because that song owns.
5540083	5540764	Gotta gotta ooh.
5540804	5541084	Yes.
5541124	5541964	Gotta gotta hot too.
5542802	5543823	Yes, beautiful.
5544023	5546765	See, he stole one of mine, so I'm going to let him have it, though.
5548486	5549067	No, you can have it.
5550388	5551949	Loki, your number one pick.
5552729	5559635	Now, this is probably going to get a lot of flack for this, but this is the song that I've learned on one of the songs other than Pink Dinosaur.
5560835	5562617	It's not that song, okay?
5563437	5564398	It's La Senorita.
5564898	5565979	La Senorita!
5569332	5572375	Alright, my number one pick is... Number one pick.
5572875	5574897	Gentle Stress, AMD, whatever.
5574937	5575017	WHAT?
5575037	5575938	NOT LET THEM MOVE!
5576959	5577359	Why me?
5580982	5582964	That would have been voted off really fast.
5583124	5584905	He's talking about putting... let them know.
5585806	5589089	Uh, Black Lab is bitching and moaning because we didn't put Get Up and Dance on there.
5590170	5590970	For a reason!
5591191	5593893	I was going to say that, but I knew it would get voted off.
5594679	5597061	No, the background is fucking rad.
5597081	5597942	We already found that out.
5597962	5601504	I believe that was the number one background voted in a previous episode.
5601564	5603586	But the song sucks.
5603826	5604367	It's booty.
5605547	5605888	Rob.
5606108	5606848	Volume 4.
5608870	5611092	You know, it only takes a minute to get good.
5611832	5613433	I'm sorry, what were you saying about that?
5613694	5614274	It was booty.
5614875	5615155	Booty.
5622879	5624400	Alright, so let me read off the list.
5624500	5625121	Yes, you may.
5625841	5628283	We have, we're starting, and don't forget to copy to the chat room.
5628423	5629324	Well, we have to eliminate.
5630045	5630905	Um, oh yeah.
5632993	5653756	I'm voting on Flashdance, Boom Boom, Dollar, KOGG3, Do It All Night, Face, If You Can Say Goodbye, Soong Sook, Afronova, Caution, Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful21C, La Señorita, Gentle Stress, AMD, Sexual Mix, Crap, Whatever What did you forget, Dave?
5654708	5657554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5668880	5672141	Surprisingly enough, I'm not going to go with the one that you'd think I'd vote off.
5672181	5678384	I'm actually going to take out Boom Boom Dollar, the KOG mix, because I'm sorry, the remix sucks.
5679104	5680665	The steps suck.
5681005	5683826	The original owns, but the remix sucks.
5684266	5686527	I remember having an asthma attack on that song.
5686867	5688388	So, fuck KOG.
5689008	5689808	Except for Rhythm and Police.
5689908	5691229	That was like the hardest trick song ever.
5691849	5692129	Okay.
5692489	5692830	Dave.
5693570	5693970	Damn.
5695251	5696191	I will take off.
5698303	5699444	If you can save, goodbye.
5699864	5700804	Ah, asshole.
5701284	5701604	Bitch.
5703185	5703845	Burn in hell.
5704926	5705386	Hey, Loki.
5706546	5707147	Bye, Travis.
5708227	5713029	I'm not a huge fan of these Korean songs, which is why I don't miss them.
5715430	5718151	So I'm going to have to say goodbye to SungSuk.
5718291	5718631	Yes!
5719512	5720692	Loki is my friend.
5725034	5727675	Leaving me with horrible choices left to make?
5728908	5730711	You have to eliminate one of these songs.
5730791	5732795	I fucking love playing all of these songs.
5736261	5741851	There are two that I'm floating back and forth and unfortunately they're both ones that Loki picked.
5744028	5746289	I'm going to take off Afronova.
5746309	5747489	Oh, taking off Afronova.
5747509	5748790	Because I'm pissed off at that song.
5748830	5751951	So it's for personal, you know, bitchy reasons.
5752051	5753652	Total personal vengeance.
5754072	5754492	All right.
5754912	5759694	So our list is, as soon as we have it posted to the chat room.
5761815	5773106	We have Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Señorita, and Gentle Stress, AMD's Sexual Mix.
5773607	5774208	Sounds good.
5774748	5780414	And while you guys vote, we're going to take a minute and we're going to play one of those songs that totally got neglected from our list.
5781548	5782788	and why you guys vote from it.
5782888	5785529	And it's all Dave's fault, too, by the way.
5786109	5787750	And we're going to play the full version of it.
5787810	5788910	And you can send in your votes.
5789230	5790471	And you've got three minutes to do it.
5790511	5793732	And then we're going to read the list when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5793752	5795532	Make sure to send your votes in private message.
5795552	5799914	Votes must be over private message to Sky in the chat room or they don't count.
5800014	5801054	We'll stick the ferret on you.
5996409	5999011	If you can say goodbye, baby
6092697	6093897	Bitch, get a new song.
6094717	6097178	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
6120714	6130704	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we've just been doing a little listless segment on the, what are we calling this, the best third mix or third Korean ever, right?
6130984	6134107	Yeah, this is listless third mix Korean.
6134247	6135308	Okay, yes.
6135589	6136670	So, without...
6137501	6142822	Further ado, let me read you what the list was that we had to pick from here.
6142902	6151564	Flashdance, Do It All Night, Face, Caution, Oh Nick Please Not So Quick, Beautiful 21C, La Senorita, and Gentle Stress AMD.
6151984	6154464	And now, I reveal the results to you.
6155704	6158325	Jamie, will you please tell them what the number three song was?
6158905	6159685	Frashdance!
6160385	6161926	Frashdance, yay!
6161946	6163386	A very good song!
6164642	6166843	and the second place winner, Jamie.
6166983	6167703	Gentle Stress.
6167943	6168484	Yay!
6168504	6169244	Because I had good taste.
6169284	6170024	Gentle Stress.
6171305	6176306	And the number one song by an overwhelming margin, might I add, was, Jamie?
6176667	6177687	Do it on that.
6180376	6180957	Yay!
6181097	6183579	Do It All Night wins the... Oh my god, Do It All Night wins!
6184720	6187182	Bestest third Korean song ever.
6187202	6188784	I want to say, I don't have bad taste.
6188864	6193828	It's just everyone in the chat room who didn't vote for Beautiful 21C, because that song owns.
6194489	6194889	So cool.
6195069	6197031	And Beautiful 21C, by the way, got no votes.
6198633	6199514	You know what we should do?
6199874	6200094	What?
6200174	6201736	We should play that during one of our next breaks.
6201976	6202096	Yeah.
6202738	6204140	There are going to be no next breaks.
6204160	6205181	We'll play during the afterbirth.
6205281	6206683	We'll do it afterbirth or after the show.
6207143	6208645	That's another thing I should add, by the way.
6209666	6213710	In effect, to keep you people listening to the station, we're not going to drop listeners after the show anymore.
6213750	6215552	We'll go right into music when the show's done.
6215892	6221138	So you can stay tuned and hear random shit from Bomani and maybe more.
6221578	6221899	Yay!
6222992	6223773	It's bootylicious.
6223993	6227495	They just don't shut up about that baseball game in the chatroom.
6227655	6227875	Booty.
6227895	6228056	Booty.
6228556	6230057	I guess the Angels won, it sounds like.
6230237	6230517	Rob.
6231398	6231918	Oh, I'm sorry.
6232218	6233479	I'm falling asleep on the watch here.
6233499	6233840	My bad.
6234800	6235281	My bad.
6236601	6237502	No, my baby mama.
6242586	6244547	The chatroom's begging me to play the legend.
6246008	6246608	Screw them.
6248226	6255008	Afterbirth Afterbirth, okay, we'll do the legend in the Afterbirth We're never playing that fucking other song again No, we're not gonna play Dirty What?
6256289	6269033	When you're emceeing at Shaft, we need to still do the rave thing That'd be hilarious Except we're gonna get the biggest, like, you faggots look from the crowd But that's okay You got a problem with that?
6270373	6272494	You can bite my big toe That's right
6273573	6277275	Jamie was teasing the idea earlier that we ought to take this show to three hours.
6277675	6278475	What do you guys think?
6278495	6279276	Chat room, let us know.
6279296	6279736	What do you think?
6279796	6280596	Three hours or what?
6280776	6283778	Or send us your comments over email, orangelounge, radio, yahoo.com.
6284058	6287759	I said that if we do three hours, then the last hour is going to be all afterbirth.
6287799	6289080	It's just going to get really random.
6289440	6292942	We might start expanding into other types of video game things, like video game reviews.
6294122	6302306	Well, since Under Sedation Live is off air in Sacramento, we can kind of roll over to something more like that show for the last hour.
6303499	6304379	That could be quite possible.
6304839	6305459	Possibility.
6305600	6308900	I don't want to steal, but... One big nerd fest.
6308980	6309800	One big nerd fest.
6309841	6310321	I like that.
6310521	6313441	You know, do anime reviews, or we can have the random reviews.
6313461	6315362	Like my review of Contra Shattered Soldier.
6315942	6316622	Yeah.
6316702	6320323	I know that I probably wouldn't be able to stay until 10, because I need to have a ride right now.
6320343	6322043	That's because you're... I don't have a license.
6322644	6324604	Be the overage part of the show.
6324924	6325464	The legal part.
6325624	6327925	That's when we all get drunk and smoke crack.
6328345	6331446	And then in four months, I'll be right here, and I'll stay the whole time.
6331826	6332766	You've got to bring your own pipe.
6334568	6335209	Your own crack fight?
6335229	6337410	Yeah, because we smoke crack when you leave.
6337931	6348959	That was something else I was thinking about bringing to a... No, no, not smoking crack, but bringing to Shaft was getting some sugar crystals and selling crack at the bake sale.
6349080	6351141	But it would just be sugar crystals, but I say crack rocks.
6351161	6351882	That'd be funny.
6353696	6354718	Orange Lounge crack.
6355059	6358504	And yes, we're working on the phone call thing, so please stop begging.
6358765	6359266	It's sad.
6360848	6361790	We're working on the phone calls.
6361810	6362992	We're going to be able to take those soon.
6363272	6364494	And then we've got the new website coming.
6364694	6367920	We're going to have a whole new season of Orange Lounge Radio before you know it.
6368482	6369202	It'll be like Buffy.
6369242	6370062	We'll go on forever and ever.
6370102	6370963	Yeah, it'll be like Buffy.
6371583	6372603	We'll kill off Jamie.
6373123	6373563	No!
6374004	6378545	And then bring her back to life and introduce her sister she never knew about.
6378805	6383866	Yeah, made from my genetic material and soul or something, and she's the next Slayer.
6384367	6386407	And then James Marshall is a nice vampire.
6387307	6388248	Dude, Spike's hot.
6390148	6391589	So what exactly would that be like?
6392429	6394830	Slightly darker shade of hue Sakura?
6394850	6395050	Yeah.
6396912	6397813	Grey Sakura.
6398214	6401417	Dude, no, I'll be like, like, you know, Blacklight Sakura.
6401918	6402419	I'll glow.
6403400	6404601	You'll be Rave Sakura.
6406483	6407344	I need a hug.
6407424	6408446	Let me give you my shingoku.
6408466	6410088	Or better yet, you'll be Booty Sakura.
6410248	6410728	No.
6411790	6414313	Let me give you my shingoku satsu of love.
6416755	6417235	There we go.
6417255	6421297	Well, we got ten minutes left in the show.
6421317	6422557	Time for all fools to be dead.
6422597	6423338	Time for you to get a watch.
6423358	6424438	Time for you to shut up.
6424658	6424998	Yeah.
6425298	6426639	Get a watch, slacker.
6429140	6429500	Let's see.
6429520	6431561	Did I have anything else on the schedule for tonight?
6432421	6432761	Nope.
6433281	6433561	No.
6434162	6436983	We're going to sit and talk about shit for the next five minutes.
6437003	6438763	Did you guys hear the fake Legend of Max MP3?
6438783	6438843	No.
6438863	6438943	No.
6441032	6441872	You want to hear the fake one?
6441952	6442773	Okay, we have the fake one.
6442873	6444574	We're going to play the fake Legend of Max.
6444594	6449556	God damn you people that keep trying to spread fake news about Legend of Max.
6450176	6452397	Or Max on whatever the fuck they're calling it.
6452417	6454098	DDR Extreme, that's what it's called.
6454358	6455579	Well, I wanted to hear it the other day.
6455639	6460601	I knew it was fake to begin with, but I still wanted to hear what Corey came up with.
6460621	6462102	Alright, let's see.
6462702	6466164	I might have actually deleted it just because I was like, what the fuck?
6466804	6467765	Yeah, no one seemed to have it.
6467785	6469125	It doesn't sound anything like Max.
6469165	6470306	I can't believe anybody bought it.
6471235	6475378	We just have to congratulate Cory on his fun hope.
6475438	6476579	I don't know if I have it.
6477880	6478040	Uh-oh.
6478980	6479501	Let me see.
6479861	6480802	I'm not giving up hope yet.
6480882	6483283	Don't all send it to me in the chatroom yet or anything.
6484244	6486726	Yeah, chatroom, don't send it all to him.
6487106	6487646	Okay, here it is.
6487666	6488107	We have it.
6488367	6488667	Alright.
6489327	6490088	This is fake.
6490848	6495832	I don't even know what the hell this really is, but this is what they tried to pass off to you as the Legend of Maxx.
6506716	6509698	Sounds like a big techno-industrial... I feel like raving!
6509758	6510699	Give me a hug!
6510719	6511059	Yeah.
6512880	6513860	Sounds happy hardcore.
6513880	6518763	When I get an envelope full of light powder, my first impression is... Just snort it!
6524346	6525767	Well, even if it isn't... GONG!
6526768	6527688	That's so Asian!
6528008	6528529	GONG!
6529769	6531730	Even if it isn't Legend of Max, it's pretty awesome.
6531770	6532451	I like this song.
6534429	6535829	I feel like taking my SATs.
6537109	6537690	Gong!
6539210	6540070	Smells like dog!
6543291	6544531	I know I actually never took the SATs.
6544551	6546651	This is the most repetitive fucking song I've ever heard.
6546671	6547651	Alright, stop it.
6549232	6549372	Oh!
6549932	6550832	There's your freeze arrow.
6551032	6551732	The big gong.
6552052	6552592	Gong!
6556773	6560033	Now you have your... It ain't over till the fat lady sings, bitch!
6561734	6562734	There's the opera singer.
6566383	6571608	You know, actually, sadly enough, I want to take this MP3 and make a DWI4, even though it is fake.
6571768	6572589	I don't give a shit.
6573309	6575431	Just call it... More repetitive than Sandstorm, though.
6575711	6579395	It's the D.Va from The Fifth Element.
6582040	6584261	Sakura sounds more like Max than this does.
6584421	6588763	Well, hell, I'd rather have it sound like that.
6588803	6594865	You know, to be honest, I'm kind of sick of Max and Max Unlimited and all the regurgitations of Max.
6594905	6598507	That would have been a nice change for sure.
6598747	6599107	I agree.
6600508	6605550	Speaking of MP3s that are probably fake, Pyro sent this to me before the show.
6605590	6606410	We all know what that means.
6607700	6613065	It's supposedly Graduation by B4U, but Lord knows what we're actually going to get when I double-click on this file.
6613485	6616929	Because Pyroman is our resident prankster in the chatroom.
6616949	6619672	So this could be a bunch of four-letter dirty words.
6619732	6622034	It could be the Spice Network, for all I know.
6622174	6624837	It's going to be like a four-minute fart.
6626418	6629661	Which would be not too far from what an actual B4U song would sound like.
6630959	6632100	True.
6632180	6633100	I made a pun.
6634521	6635442	Alright, let's see what it is.
6635482	6637763	This is supposedly Graduation by B4U.
6644767	6646288	Well, the back singing indicates it's B4U.
6646328	6649950	Maybe this really is it.
6656073	6656673	You know what it is?
6656733	6658014	I think it's Dive Backwards.
6668939	6671061	Nope, this is actually Japanese.
6674285	6676567	Jamie's trying to see if she can hear the lyrics.
6686437	6689641	I swear to God, this is probably just True or Die played backwards.
6689661	6690121	It's not...
6705553	6706073	This is legit.
6707174	6707474	Really?
6707494	6708215	What are they saying?
6709075	6711496	I only know or understood like five words of it.
6711876	6715899	Unfortunately the vocals are a little bit too low for me to hear over the music with as stuck up as my head is.
6715919	6716419	Well, who knows?
6734762	6740385	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6760444	6762866	Now what if it was from like a single or something like that?
6763386	6763807	You never know.
6764207	6764907	That could possibly be.
6765808	6768230	Alright, so maybe that was graduation, maybe it wasn't.
6768270	6771953	You just don't know anymore because there's too many damn people out there spreading fake fakers.
6771993	6773554	At any rate, it was not a beefy show backwards.
6776076	6777957	I actually heard a few real words.
6778718	6779018	Okay.
6781500	6784262	You missed the voting by about like 10 minutes.
6784322	6784823	Who was that?
6785083	6786084	It's the 23rd Magus.
6786464	6787004	Oh, sorry.
6787224	6787985	What did he vote for?
6788025	6789086	He voted for Los Inuerito.
6790094	6790454	Oops!
6792236	6794718	That wouldn't have made her break any ties, so no worries.
6795919	6797700	I can't believe that survived the list anyway.
6797720	6798621	I should have knocked that one out.
6798641	6799001	I'm just kidding.
6799962	6802864	It's because I wasn't going to vote it off because it sounds like Ray Martin.
6803065	6807408	The thing is, La Senorita in Trick is fun.
6807708	6807949	It is.
6808109	6809250	Because of the little skip moves.
6809270	6811852	You can do that jump and you can jump.
6812212	6813573	What's your favorite newbie move?
6814113	6815134	My favorite newbie move?
6815855	6817917	I think those La Senorita skips are my favorite newbie move.
6817937	6819458	Either that or the clapping in Macquah.
6820482	6830545	Um, I would probably have to say that my favorite is actually, and this is a move that I was doing two years ago, my very ever first routine was the butterfly spin.
6831445	6832565	The butterfly bounce jump.
6833686	6846489	Alright, you know what I'm talking about, where you have your two jumps, you stomp on, alright, for people who remember the steps for butterfly basic, you've got right foot step, jump, and then you turn around and jump the other way.
6847009	6849354	but you bounce before you do it and I think it kind of looks neat.
6849654	6857569	And my other favorite one is the spins on Love To Me where they're like down, up, jump, and then down, up, jump again and you do the spins on them.
6858531	6858932	Those look cool.
6859765	6865168	I'm not sure if this is considered a newbie freestyle move or not, but I love the caution drop.
6865308	6865848	It's so fun.
6865968	6867168	I love the caution drop too.
6867449	6869009	I'm really tall, so it's really hard.
6869790	6870330	But it's fun.
6870610	6875672	I don't know if that's considered a newbie move or just an 18 freestyle type move or what.
6875952	6877853	You have to be damn precise to make it look good though.
6878113	6881555	Yeah, like only a little bee can pull it off well.
6883769	6887572	I used to do the knee drop on End of the Century.
6887612	6888212	I thought I was all cool.
6888232	6888553	I... I... I...
6903673	6912238	I still do knee drops now, like for my one edit for Ecstasy where it freezes on a knee drop in the center two arrows on doubles.
6912919	6915720	I stopped doing that because it bruises my knees very badly.
6915961	6919503	Dude, I still have, okay, this is where I compare scars.
6920884	6921964	Ab bruise, right there.
6923405	6926467	For all those who can't see through the radio, she's pointing to her knee.
6927468	6930429	Wait, I have, um... Dude, you have a scar.
6931130	6931390	I do?
6931410	6931490	I do.
6931741	6938323	Yeah, that's from playing Bakua, my routine, where I scrape my knee because I fell.
6938543	6942724	I just remember being at Faname last year.
6943744	6952167	In my Emmy costume, my third mix Emmy costume, doing my favorite Kamikaze drop on Love to Me, back when Love to Me was still kind of cool.
6953187	6958532	Going out into the hall with blood dripping down my leg from landing on a screw on that fourth plus.
6958932	6967479	For Shaps, I could do a rehash of my Dynamite Rave routine where I forget my steps about... Dude, that started off so cool.
6967499	6968840	Fifteen seconds into the song.
6968880	6973464	He pulls off the trench coat and everyone's like, and then he forgets his steps.
6973484	6975806	And it's like, crap.
6978309	6980790	It was so awesome, the beginning of it.
6981170	6981790	It was like the matrix.
6981810	6985772	And actually, one of the coolest knee drops I've ever seen was also at the same Fonamay.
6985912	7001238	A guy I know, Chris, did Dynamite Rave, just as one of the characters from Guilty Gear X, and did the corner knee drop, where you step on the up and right, and then knee drop down to the bottom and left.
7002458	7003699	Diagonally, that looks really cool.
7004352	7008818	You know, I actually have a scar on my leg in the exact same place that Dave has one, but it has nothing to do with DDR.
7008838	7009899	It's from a game of Truth or Dare.
7011501	7011821	Wow.
7012743	7014124	Stand by to win.
7014905	7015246	Wow.
7015706	7016487	What's going on out there?
7016868	7017308	Oh, I see.
7017629	7018570	Oh, my roommate's on the phone.
7019371	7020793	Too bad we can't broadcast it over the air.
7021253	7021594	Hi.
7023021	7024142	This is really good radio.
7024162	7025583	It's great radio.
7026743	7041392	You know, I actually, you know, as much as people bitch and complain about it, I miss the old, you know, 18s style moves just because if you do them right, they look so amazing coordinated though.
7041852	7043433	And true, they're tired routines.
7043853	7052058	You know, I like watching people do like real dance moves on DDR and that's great and I would prefer watching that for different freestyles since I've judged, you know, a few tournaments before.
7052742	7056765	But the 18 stuff, when done right, is so clean.
7057505	7058306	And it looks really good.
7059607	7062208	I miss the Changos do-it-all-night routine.
7062409	7062969	Oh, God, no.
7063109	7063850	I love that.
7065651	7066571	I don't miss him at all.
7067941	7074363	I remember, was it his Ninzaburra routine, where he was like, what's that guy who brings out the hammer and squash?
7074543	7075763	Yeah, he's like the Gallagher of PDR.
7075803	7077223	Okay, that routine sucked.
7077763	7080444	Yeah, but he squashed a watermelon in the space.
7080604	7082324	That still sucked.
7083165	7084465	Okay.
7084505	7085765	What was funny about that?
7085785	7086706	Yay, attention!
7086726	7087226	Yay, attention!
7087406	7089166	Look, I'm a whore, give me attention.
7089426	7089826	Yay.
7090426	7090787	Anyway.
7090827	7091947	What the fuck was funny about that?
7092687	7093767	Okay.
7093827	7094267	Yay!
7094787	7096728	We're going to smash a watermelon.
7099059	7100660	That's why it was funny, because it was random.
7100860	7101681	It was stupid!
7102441	7103182	What's the point?
7103242	7103882	It was random.
7104563	7105523	It was still stupid.
7107284	7108085	It's not funny.
7108105	7109626	That's not something that wins a tournament.
7109666	7111327	It's like two heads arguing back and forth.
7111367	7112648	Random, stupid, random, stupid.
7113148	7115390	Random is good, but only when it's funny random.
7115450	7118091	I'm sure he didn't enter trying to win with that routine.
7118852	7119852	It was still retarded.
7119912	7122414	Speaking of random and stupid, this show is about over.
7123995	7125436	Well, actually, he won third.
7127677	7127958	Dude...
7129824	7133507	Just goes to show what lovely judges you can get at a tournament sometimes, right?
7133607	7135668	It just goes to show people are easily amused.
7135929	7137710	Anyways, we should talk about the movie Jackass.
7138190	7138651	No!
7138971	7140332	I'll come up later.
7140452	7141513	Jamie's not going to go see that.
7141533	7141813	All right.
7142334	7143935	Final thoughts, Jamie.
7143975	7145256	Let's start with the cupcakes.
7145336	7146717	Loki, any final thoughts here?
7148284	7175221	go check out my website if you haven't www.leachfromloki.tk leave me a request for what 2DX song you want me to make into DWI Next and I'll put it up there that's it Dave I have nothing more to talk about I guess I'll talk about a movie that I want to talk about in the afterbirth not Jackass but until then yeah okay they're talking about stuff
7176707	7178148	and here's my final thought.
7183510	7184010	Impressive.
7185251	7186231	God, my nose hurts.
7186671	7189412	And my final thought is I need a date.
7189992	7190373	Thank you.
7190853	7191293	Date Rob.
7193510	7193951	That's it.

7199640	7200141	Stay tuned.
7200241	7202785	Remember, one and one does not make two.

7236179	7236559	Jill?
7236979	7237579	Hi, Barry.
7237959	7239540	Why on earth are you here?
7239820	7240840	I'll be examining this.
7240900	7241281	Barry?
7241961	7242601	Barry!
7243141	7244902	I just had something I wanted to check.
7245042	7247243	I think I'll stay and look around more.
7248944	7249404	Whoa!
7249864	7250864	What the hell?
7250944	7252665	Chris, you're here too?
7252985	7255626	I think I'm beginning to understand.
7255806	7257627	That's what I was going to say.
7258047	7259968	Chris is our old partner, you know.
7260788	7262769	Hey, we're partners, aren't we?
7263615	7264656	Let's work together.
7265036	7266016	Look at this.

7267457	7267857	What is it?
7267877	7268697	What do you think of it?
7269098	7270018	Protect yourself.
7270538	7272599	Perhaps that was the most important part.
7273040	7273680	Let's go.
7274100	7275661	Okay, I'll go first.
7275821	7277302	Sam, it's broken.
7277582	7278362	Seems like it.
7279183	7280623	Oh, my God.
7280643	7282464	Hey, what's going on?
7282844	7284085	All right, can you do it?

7291329	7291369	Ah!
7293143	7294363	Lost courage already?
7294383	7298845	I'm sorry for my lack of manners, but I'm not used to escorting men.
7299705	7300146	Jill!
7300746	7301286	Let's do it.
7301706	7302266	Ah, yes.
7302506	7303067	Barry!

7307728	7308349	Let's go.
7314631	7315391	Thank you, Barry.
7315771	7316912	Yeah, yeah.
7316972	7318712	Is this a meeting room or something?
7318732	7319533	Is that you, Rebecca?
7319553	7319713	Yes.
7319893	7320133	Yes.

7324116	7325497	May I practice for a while?

7334883	7337425	I feel like we're having a secret meeting.
7338005	7338546	Let's do it!
