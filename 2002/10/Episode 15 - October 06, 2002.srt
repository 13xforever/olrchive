1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Boring!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain nudity, Orange Lounge may

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,760
contain many four-letter words, hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,640
The last Metroid is in captivity.

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:08,640
The galaxy is at peace.

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,880
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Ron, Rono, he's good.

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Missed it by that much.

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
How can you tell?

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I never forget a pussy.

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,880
37. My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
In a row?

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
So you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,880
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Dark Sakura.

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Sky.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Do I look like the weather girl?

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
No.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Everything alright?

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
We are live and this is episode number 15 for October the 6th of 2002.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,440
You're tuned into the Bemani Sings most super duper radio station of all things Bemani.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,020
Joining me as always is our resident happy bunny.

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,360
Everyone please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Zakra.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Hi.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,400
You sound so weak tonight, you sound weakened.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Hi!

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Dark Zakra needs food badly.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
I had cupcakes.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
That's my crack.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,240

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,920

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,320

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,940

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,440
well earlier but my dad like hell no one

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Okay, that's not nice. Cool.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Okay, so we'll be talking to everybody else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do some more of Jamie's picks.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
That whole last hour was just nothing but Jamie picks.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
This one was special.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
We're doing more Jamie picks. How is it special, Jamie?

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,440
This particular one is one I talked about last week.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,440
It's basically Osamu Koboda and Tack live doing Presto and Era.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,440
And then the minute one after that is a song that's from Beatmania's final.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,440
It's the Naoki track.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Sounds very good. We're going to hear those.

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
And later on we're going to be talking lots and lots and lots about Max USA.

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Tons of news on that coming up.

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,440
And we'll talk about 8 style. We'll see if we can get Naoki journals.

67
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Your FUs of the week and just a ton of shit tonight.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
So tell everybody to listen.

69
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Dear Diary.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Dear Diary, Orange Lounge is cool.

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Dear diary,

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Thank you very much.

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,440
and

80
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,440
and

81
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,480
and

82
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
and

83
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480

84
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
and

85
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
and

86
00:09:46,480 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, Ash!

87
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

88
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,760
We have Jazz in the chat room tonight.

89
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Hello.

90
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Hello.

91
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Hello to everybody.

92
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,320
We are very glad to have you back in the chat room.

93
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Hello to everybody in our chat room.

94
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
We've got lots of people in there tonight.

95
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,900
If you want to join our chat room, you've just got to go to any other side IRC server

97
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Orange Lounge.

98
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,700
And we expect you a nice play again.

99
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes.

100
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
So, wow.

101
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Wow.

102
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Big, how was your week?

103
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Let's transition our way into the show.

104
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,020
That's going to go into my fuck you of the week, so you should hold on to that.

105
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm going to tease our, because we usually do fuck yous of the week, like first thing

106
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
right away.

107
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,720
it maybe the second half of the show, just because I feel like it. I don't feel like

108
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,600
doing the fucking show. Yes, we're evil. We're going to make you wait. I have some thank

109
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
yous of the week though. I've got plenty of happy news for this week. We don't need happy.

110
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,400
We need pissy. I want to be happy. I've got lots of happy news too. Well, as we mentioned

111
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,480
before we went to break, Loki knows how to kiss some host ass around the show, got Jamie

112
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,280
and I some advanced copies of Notorious CHO on tape. How cool is that?

113
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,840
We are happy and need to change pants.

114
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,360
Yes, very happy. I am very happy. So, we got that and also a big thank you to Loki and

115
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,800
Black Lab as well, who is one of our regular listeners also in the chat room. They've been

116
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,120
whoring out the show in their signatures and we always appreciate every free promo we can

117
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
get. So, a big thank you to them.

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Thank you.

119
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,520
I'd like to give a big thank you to jahi if you're out there listening for cracking me the fuck up on under station live

120
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,480
org last night, that's the radio show I do on Saturday nights and

121
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
He was so damn funny on that show last night talking about

122
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Giving the bling bling to Ling Ling

123
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
How it's gonna do a drive-by on the pandas

124
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
I know it makes no sense to any of you out there

125
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,000
But trust me if you listen under station live org it's fucking hilarious very good on the show last night and what else?

126
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,940
Walgreens

127
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Last minute junk food, around about 15 minutes before I came here.

128
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
And vanilla crack.

129
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
And yes, vanilla coke.

130
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
And there was something else I wanted to thank. I forget what it was, though.

131
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,940
I would like to thank air for being there for me to breathe.

132
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,940
Rob wanted to thank me for being beautiful and inspiration. I'm like a muse.

133
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Here he comes, Mr. Orange Lounge.

134
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
He's not very orange today.

135
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,740
today. By the way, that's the only time you're going to hear me sing on this show. Unless

136
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,780
you do your Let Them Move Elmo mix. Oh, God. That's old school. That is old school. I haven't

137
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,180
done the Let Them Move Elmo mix. The only reason I don't do the Let Them Move Elmo mix

138
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,380
on this show is because I know Twynn would get ahold of it and make some nasty remix

139
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:19,740
out of it. So, I'm just withholding the Elmo bit. So, back in the news about DDR, Bimani.

140
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,440
How was your week? How was your week in the B E Monte world?

141
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,980
I heard you had some accomplishments this week.

142
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,560
Okay, well, I tried to stop counting how many nine-footers I was doing, but I'm still kind of excited about it because I did so many in a row.

143
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,020
And I finally

144
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,480
owned Twilight Zone.

145
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,300
And then me being the big idiot that I am, decided to do so deep.

146
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,780
And my legs gave out from under me. Yeah, pretty far though. I was watching you do that.

147
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,980
Like, I don't know if you know, but Irene, myself, and Brad, we were all kind of huddled in the corner watching you do it.

148
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,100
We were like, oh, oh, oh, oh.

149
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:56,100
My legs actually, you know when you get so tired that your legs just get really stiff after playing DDR?

150
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
That happened to me and I could not move. I actually had to grab the bar.

151
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,100
And you know, the bar for me, I usually treat it like it's made out of feces or something.

152
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh, accomplishments. I passed two 7-stars on 3DX. Yay! Absolute in Buffalo. And they were cool.

153
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Buffalo! Buffalo!

154
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Yeah, that song was cool.

155
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,100
I tried many more, but I failed them all.

156
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
I'm not good enough yet.

157
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Not until I can pass all of them.

158
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Be for you, another!

159
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Try Y31.

160
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Y31 is easy, try it.

161
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
But I can't pass it yet.

162
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
I was very, very happy today.

163
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
I passed a 7 star in 2DX and I wanted to pass it for a long, long time at sync.

164
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,100
I did Summer Vacation a couple days ago too, which is a flashing 7.

165
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
That made me happy.

166
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Apparently my controller is blessed.

167
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Your controller is the bomb diggity.

168
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,100
My 2DX controller kicks everybody else's controller's ass.

169
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
And you know, I'm still pissed off about my arcade controller.

170
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Why's that?

171
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Because Konami style hasn't emailed me back, so let me know it's being redelivered.

172
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Fuck Konami! Oh wait, we're not there yet.

173
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Wait, why does your controller kick ass?

174
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Because my controller has magical powers.

175
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
I can only pass summer vacation on her controller.

176
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
I can't do it on my own controller.

177
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I can only do it on hers, because hers goes clacky clacky clack, and mine just goes...

178
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:21,100
My controller stuck for like a week, and then I bitched at it, and it unstuck and has been beautiful ever since.

179
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Oh, because I was playing on Scott, white freestyle or whatever, his 2DX controller, and he said that he like shaved it down or something and it worked perfectly. That's pretty cool.

180
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm not raping my controller yet.

181
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Yeah, I don't know, but it worked and it didn't stick at all.

182
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,460
I'm scared to open up my controller and give it an operation because I don't know, if you

183
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,980
ever played that game Operation, I was so horrible at it and I'm afraid I'd do the same

184
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,180
thing to my 2DX controller that the big red light would go off and go, eh, you know.

185
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,940
Let me fix your controller.

186
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I will use the power of my...

187
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,180
Oh, you're going to fix my controller.

188
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,460
I will use the power of my bitchiness on your controller.

189
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,420
I will put the fear of me into your controller.

190
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,580
Are you just going to lay it on the ground and just go, you are a bitch?

191
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
I command thee to work!

192
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,580
The power of Christ compels thee! The power of Christ compels thee!

193
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Demons be gone from this controller!

194
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,580
I hope my roommate didn't decide to go bed too early.

195
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Good thing. If he's smart, he got out of the house. I don't know.

196
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I didn't see him.

197
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Oh, I'm getting a suggestion in the chat room that when I play Operation, I should take out the battery and I'll win every time.

198
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,940
a winner you know you know what I do what I pick up the thing and jump it

199
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,460
upside down I wonder if we can do that with patience you should be a doctor

200
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:58,380
Jamie you make tons of money a big special hello to our buddy sharks girl

201
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Just for you, baby.

202
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Hello.

203
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,380
This is a dear diary.

204
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
I've got a doughnut with your name on it.

205
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,380
It made me feel all tingly.

206
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,380
I don't want to talk about Monty tonight. Let's just sit here and ramble.

207
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Dear diary, I decided that I was going to be a hockey fan.

208
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Yay!

209
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,380
You know, I swear to God, Naoki and Michael Jackson have got close relatives.

210
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,380
I mean, they're both hideously feminine.

211
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Do you remember the rumor that Naoki was supposed to be one of the hidden members of B4U?

212
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,380
I'm still convinced that he's a woman.

213
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
Excuse me.

214
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,380
Thank you. That burp was brought to you by vanilla coke.

215
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,380
It's got that chili flavorings to it that I had earlier today.

216
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
And now it's all over the mic.

217
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
Ewww, let's rob Mike!

218
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,380
I want to thank Del Taco. Del Taco owns. That's all I want to say. Thank you.

219
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,380
All you people who ate real food today, I've had a doughnut, string cheese, and cupcakes.

220
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Whee! Oh, and the all-important bottle of Propel. Yes.

221
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,380
I'm on the supermodel diet right now, where I have a cigarette for breakfast and a two-shot

222
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,280
tequila for dinner

223
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,600
but when is it

224
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,060
calories what we say that

225
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,460
for the sake of uh... internet radio i think that we get back to anything

226
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,200
relevant half back and i'll fuck the money stop playing the are that's our

227
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,780
advice get your life back

228
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,740
savior but that is the trouble

229
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
don't turn out like us

230
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,860
we're here

231
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,980
so anyways uh...

232
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,260
yesterday

233
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,580
went to an awesome

234
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:50,580
party for Pat. Hey, Pat's cool, ok. I missed going, I went to the go. His birthday. So

235
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:59,180
we went and we played the DDR sim, of course, the giant DDR sim. It's all about Super Shuffle,

236
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,080
ok. Now, if you've ever wondered what... What, pray tell, is Super Shuffle? Super Shuffle

237
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,940
is what Shuffle should be, it's where every single step is random. And then what's fun

238
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,060
One is, shuffle works in doubles, so playing super shuffle in doubles is like playing twister.

239
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,300
No, and see how freeze arrows work is, freeze arrows are set when the next arrow comes up,

240
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,980
but since, so normally in a song, they have the specific ending, but since, and then the

241
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,060
next note comes up under it, but since there's no note coming up under it, the freeze arrow

242
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,360
just keeps going.

243
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,480
You might have to hold, in doubles, eight freeze arrows.

244
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,360
What happened last night? Scott had to hold all eight arrows. He failed like that song,

245
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,480
but it was funny.

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
That's when you have an orgy on the dance pad.

247
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,320
You know what, Loki? I'm not playing on your metal pads again until you get the Spider-Stomp

248
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Sim.

249
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
I'm gone!

250
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Spider-Stomp!

251
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Spider-Stomp!

252
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Fuck the body, it's all about Spider-Stomp.

253
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
What are you taking, Sue?

254
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Well, hi-ho on doubles is actually pretty much like Spider-Stomp. It's just all jumping.

255
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Could you imagine how fucking horrible Golf Land would be if, well, you know, even more

256
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
so...

257
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Golf Land horrible?

258
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
No!

259
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Even more so, if fucking DDR spat out tickets.

260
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,240
Dude, I would be walking out of there with scooters every day.

261
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,320
I know, but think about just how horrible the lines would be.

262
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,800
If DDR spat out tickets, it's over.

263
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I quit.

264
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800
You know how much pretty useless shit that we have?

265
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Like I'd have a million little blinking raver lights and like five skateboards and oh my

266
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,240
gosh I spent so much money on that game even if I only got one ticket for every time I

267
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,440
played I'd still have a ton of shit.

268
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,800
It's about time they give me something back for the money I spent on that damn thing.

269
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,760
You know, you get it.

270
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sorry Dave, did somebody say Rayvar?

271
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,040
is the marked

272
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,040
at the rate

273
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:14,140
yeah

274
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,140
uh...

275
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Yeah, let's get this train back on the rails here.

276
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Should we talk about...

277
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,140
This is what we get for having all that sugar before the show.

278
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Yeah, but I didn't see so...

279
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Should we talk about the...

280
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,140
You ate Cheetos, those are a weak sauce.

281
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
So what?

282
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
They're orange-themed.

283
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,140
From now on, whenever anyone starts talking about raves on this show, I'm gonna play Sandstorm.

284
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Coming to a Max USA near you.

285
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
We think. We're pretty sure.

286
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
We hope.

287
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,140
Confirmed, dammit. So, none of that.

288
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,140
Anyway, your little precious update.

289
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Yes, our update.

290
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Naoki's spout-off is a little crap today, but we didn't really care about what he had to say.

291
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,140
All we cared about is new information about DDR Max 3.

292
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Which is that non-stop modes will be making a return.

293
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
Whee!

294
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
So, hooray for non-stops.

295
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
I guess.

296
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
So, I guess that'll be fun.

297
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Also gonna be actually not really news yet, but it's coming is next week

298
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,860
They're announced what song won the vote for?

299
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,020
That's actually going to be in max 3 one song one song is going to win the vote

300
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:38,300
No, they're announcing one song next week, and they're going to continually they're going to continually announce songs each coming

301
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Week so next Wednesday

302
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,300
Okay, I believe it's the night. They will have

303
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:57,300
They will have the next song for DDR Max 3, which I've heard is going to be Let Them Move.

304
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,280
Saying rave in the chat room doesn't count.

305
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,140
It has to be in the studio, so quit it.

306
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:09,740
Jamie, quit playing with the ferret.

307
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,700
celebration in the chat room saying, yay, I won't fail Oni Choruses with 3.1 anymore

308
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,980
because non-stops are back. Yay! What song do you think will be announced? What do you

309
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:26,300
think the first non-original will be? V? I think it's going to be V. That's where my

310
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:34,980
money is. I would hope, I'm praying, that it's Instant Love. Yes, Instant Love! Hey,

311
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,260
I'll have you know, I voted for that, so if it is, I'd be so pleased.

312
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
This would be me.

313
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Instant love, clear cookies.

314
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Instant love, clear cookies.

315
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Instant love, clear cookies.

316
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
Instant love.

317
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,140
I swear to God, I'm such a fucking retard, okay?

318
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,980
I went to the site to vote for a song.

319
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,620
I voted for flotation.

320
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Flotation.

321
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,500
I'm such a dumbass and I can't read Japanese.

322
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,860
So let's read what Naoki has to say, since we don't really care, but anyways.

323
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Okay, the beginning of a prologue. With DDR finished and re-released in a matter of weeks, we had to begin work on the second game, DDR 2nd Mix.

324
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Ooh.

325
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:21,860
2nd Mix represents the beginning of Naoki. What about 1st Mix? Was that not Naoki?

326
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,860
See, I've been saying this.

327
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Because I'm brilliant to you.

328
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Naoki in a dress.

329
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Because of Brilliant to You, a song which quickly gained support of DDR players during its production, in respect to a music producer who played a large part in its production, you credited the song in your own name, Naoki.

330
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:08,860
The song expresses you perfectly. It's the kind of song that makes a very pleasant sensation, as if the bewitched melody of synths is flowing from the very center of your body.

331
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:23,860
I have to interrupt for a second just to say, if you don't like Second Mix, if Second Mix does not own your soul, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you a hundred times over. Second Mix is ownage. Jamie and I say so, therefore it is true.

332
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,860
And because we're on the radio, you have to believe everything you hear.

333
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Strictly business, like what?

334
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Nah, brilliant to you, orchestra groove.

335
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Uh, fuckin' tub-thumping. That's all I have to say. Best freestyle ever. Fuck you.

336
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Anyway, I'll never forget the pleasant sensation held by this song.

337
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,860
And so I tried to continue reproducing it.

338
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Incidentally, next time I feel I achieved this was in Dynamite Rave.

339
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Dynamite rave. That's no surprise. That's no surprise. Uh oh. We did say rave. Uh oh.

340
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Oh yes, you said rave. Oh man, this is so sweet. Oh, I'm seeing so many colors, man.

341
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,860
This DJ, oh I love the DJ. Oh, praise the DJ. Oh man. Dude, I just drank my first drink.

342
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,860
Wait, what, what the hell just happened? We have a, we have a word of the day.

343
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,140
We have a word of the day, and whenever the word is said, we play that song, coming to

344
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,140
a USA mix near you, and have our own little... The magic word is rave.

345
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Oh my god. Leave now! Save yourself!

346
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Anyway, back to the Nucky Diaries.

347
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
We've got tweroes going here.

348
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Let's see here. Since the second mix, music technology hasn't advanced, but your range of songs is much wider.

349
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Listening to

350
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Your stupid rage

351
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,240
What the hell wait what happened

352
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Welcome to the raid.

353
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Welcome to the raid.

354
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Welcome to the raid.

355
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Okay, back to Noki.

356
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I quit.

357
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Anyways, from now on it's just going to be called Dynamite R3.

358
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Sounds good, okay.

359
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Alright, let's see here.

360
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Listening to the soundtrack now, how do you think that has evolved since these early roots?

361
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Looking back and reflecting on music's second mix, it brings to mind songs like Higher, Baby Give Me Your Love from fourth mix,

362
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,360
from 4th Mix. In fact, these songs feel like 2nd Mix.

363
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,880
I haven't really noticed any... Okay, whatever.

364
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,000
Anyways, there's a strong connection between the music in these two games.

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,360
Yeah, because it's the same game. It's the same guy making it.

366
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,080
Anyways, time has shown that 2nd Mix was a huge success.

367
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,320
The 2nd Mix soundtrack CD sold over 550,000 copies,

368
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,160
all for Butterfly. Yes, all for Butterfly and that

369
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,520
Dynamite R3 anyway so with the successive

370
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,200
whatever with the success of second mix lifting my spirits everything seemed to

371
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
pass very quickly

372
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,880
and before I knew it I was working on solo base mix third mix and true kiss

373
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,320
destinations all at once

374
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
GDR was really starting to take off

375
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,920
what did he write for true kiss destination wasn't that all their own stuff

376
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,600
no true kiss destination had sexy planet and

377
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,680
Celebrate Night. I got it backwards. I thought the other one, Dreams Come True, had the Naoki

378
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,840
tracks in it.

379
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,200
Ah, Dreams Come True sucks.

380
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,000
But it was a good beat mania mix.

381
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Good point. Very good point made in the chat room. $550,000 sold. One billion pirated.

382
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,840
Anyways, some more stuff about the non-stop. They've got, it's going to be four songs in

383
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,840
a life gauge, just like normal non-stops, and it looks like the highest score you can get is 100 million points.

384
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,840
How many pirated copies? The second mixer award, thank you.

385
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Hey, I have mine on Dreamcast.

386
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm sure that guy that holds the world record is going to get 101 million.

387
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Oh yeah, dude, our twin galaxy's world record holder is going to get like, you know, 300 points and he's going to be the fucking world record holder.

388
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:43,840
And then there's, okay, and then on Naoki's little journal there's some other crap I don't know what it is about. It looks like how to play with freeze arrows or something.

389
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
It's how to dance like Naoki.

390
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,840
You okay? You're gonna find what? Oh, you're gonna find the translator? Do you want me to go to break or something?

391
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah, but it looks like it has something to do with the use of freeze arrows, like how they're inputted into the game.

392
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
I'll try to go back with the translation of this after our next lecture.

393
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,840
It's pointless information. No one cares. We can see by what Afro is doing, he is playing with a blank screen.

394
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,840
So obviously he's not too smart to begin with. So we don't really care what's going on there either.

395
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Then they have some stupid, like, oh, this is a logo for secret rendezvous that didn't make the game.

396
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Oh, cry. Don't care. Okay.

397
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Sniff.

398
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,040
I kinda like that logo. It looks like it's pavement.

399
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,200
Like, this game is hitting the pavement.

400
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Pavement? Girls on couch.

401
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,920
Pavement? Girls on couch.

402
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,200
Girls on pavement. Now you're getting somewhere.

403
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Their house could have pavement on the floor, okay?

404
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,480
They didn't show the floor, they just showed the couch with the girls.

405
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:54,120
So there, it can be like, wait, it can be like Night at the Roxbury, they have the inside

406
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,840
out night club, and then they have, I almost said it, but I didn't.

407
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
What?

408
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
What did you always say?

409
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,320
No, no, no, wait, hold on, hold on.

410
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,640
Because that logo that you see before you start the song, I think that's what this was

411
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
supposed to be.

412
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,820
And you know, like, before you start the song, all the logo is, it just says, you know, secret

413
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,000
rendezvous written in the neon thing and then, you know, divas.

414
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,960
so i thought i don't know in that aspect of the that was kind of cool at least

415
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,560
has a little arrow drawn under something it's not that plane but

416
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,520
but the lesbian video rules

417
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
yeah

418
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,320
was being

419
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,060
anyway so just want to stay tuned for next uh... for wednesday actually for

420
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,600
nike journal three were to be talking about

421
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,800
what he has for breakfast and

422
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,000
and underwear

423
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Here's I. Today my best friend Paula came over to sleep with me in my pressure taper.

424
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I got the idea from my good friend Mickey.

425
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Now obviously we slept together and not together, you know what I mean?

426
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because I don't swing that way.

427
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Speaking of secret rendezvous, we're gonna kind of transition to another topic here.

428
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:17,000
As you probably know, the original PlayStation Magazine demo of DDR Max USA hit shelves this week, and one of the songs in it is Secret Rendezvous.

429
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Now, one of our pals in the chatroom, JB, took a really interesting picture. I want to show you guys, and I- shit, I already lost the link.

430
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
JB, post that link in the chatroom once you hear that, the picture, so I can show that, and then everybody in the chatroom can see it too.

431
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,520
it's it's a really funny picture about the uh...

432
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,620
the demo i want to show you as soon as jb postal link here

433
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,280
hopefully he's not a minute lag like some of the people in return

434
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,720
uh... yeah i was supposed to mount over a but a lot of stores got it early so

435
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,400
most uh... major grocery stores not stuff out now thank you slinky slinky

436
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,520
into it

437
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,860
and that would be in a chair will show you guys

438
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,720
look at this

439
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,700
if you sort by letter

440
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,740
you get l

441
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,620
the past and speaker on the bill

442
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,040
whether the producers tried to tell you

443
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,300
let's

444
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,140
speaker about the people

445
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,060
uh...

446
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,740
that's a cool

447
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,600
now we have to say about the lesbian they had a secret love us

448
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,700
and you know i discovered

449
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,540
anyway

450
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:33,540
That's not even- Glenn raises a very good point. What the fuck are we saying? That's not even in alphabetical order. That picture is obviously photoshopped by somebody, right?

451
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Yeah. Wouldn't it be? Cause L- Or they thought it was L. Oops, sorry. Or they thought it was funny, too. Yeah, that would have to be photoshopped.

452
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Let me take a look. Boy, we're easily fooled on this show. Yeah, it's gotta be photoshopped, cause E doesn't come before- or, E doesn't come after L.

453
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Oh, you mean, maybe not.

454
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,540
It would also be funny if it was ESL.

455
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Yeah, ESL, you know.

456
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:00,540
Because most of the people at Konami must be taking ESL.

457
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,540
They teach it in high school. Maybe they're all still in high school.

458
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Anyways, yeah, so one of the things that they did with this Max demo is they hacked into it and found the song list. Hooray!

459
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
So, we actually have the song list.

460
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,520
I don't think that that's a law.

461
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,520
It's debatable and this is a huge debate and we're not going to get it resolved on this show.

462
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:32,520
There's people said yes, that's the list and there are people people saying no, that's not the list and yes, that's the list and no, that's not the list and yes, that's, you know, what, it just keeps going back and fourth but.

463
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
But.

464
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
What, what, theory? Okay, let's hear the theory. Let's hear an interesting theory.

465
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,520
DSCS SoCalCIC says it is fake.

466
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Again, yes it's the list, no it's not the list, yes it's the list.

467
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,020
And DJ Konami says, no it's not.

468
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Why don't we just put in the demo and try it ourselves?

469
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
That's what I'm saying.

470
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Okay, supposedly here's how they got the list, okay.

471
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:04,020
They went in to the XA file, which is the PlayStation audio format, you know, that they use.

472
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:11,020
Now, in those, you can actually listen to the small little samples of sounds that play when you select a certain song.

473
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Now, supposedly since they hurried to get this demo done so fast, they didn't bother to cut that out.

474
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Most average people are going to go,

475
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,020
oh, I'm going to go hack into this and go listen for songs.

476
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,020
So what happened was if someone did that,

477
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,020
which just proves that people that play DDR are sick fucking people.

478
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Yes, so what happened?

479
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
For any demo they're going to do that,

480
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,020
they're just going to lock out the other stuff or remove it.

481
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,020
So what they did was they went in there and actually listened to all that.

482
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Now, I'm not sure if there was an actual song list.

483
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,020
I don't believe that there was an actual song list there,

484
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,020
but perhaps they identified stuff based off of what they heard on there.

485
00:35:45,020 --> 00:36:08,020
I opened up a file in a notepad and it shows you a big list and it looked like every single freaking song that's ever been in DDR. Like it was for either some kind of append or it was all the four letter edit codes. That's what I thought it was. It was all the four letter edit codes because it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that that I know are not going to be in Max.

486
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,260
codes, which that's what I thought it was, was all the four letter edit codes, because

487
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,820
it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that, that I know are not going to be in max,

488
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,020
that things are not going to be in max Tuesday, but it also had new stuff. It had the short

489
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,060
long trip in there, and it had I Like to Move It, it had a remix of Dynamite Rave, and it

490
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:37,180
had, oh yeah, I'm sorry, I said rave. Oh yeah, oh yeah, this rave is heavy. Anyway, but that

491
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,660
That wasn't in there. That song. Sandstorm was not in that list which I thought was interesting.

492
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,700
So I don't know. I don't think anyone at Konami is intentionally messing with us. I don't

493
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,280
think that's the case. So if somebody's saying that list is planted, I think it's BS. I think

494
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,540
somebody at Konami just got lazy, but I don't think it was a finished version.

495
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,620
Gee, Konami be lazy on a DDR mix.

496
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:04,540
Keep in mind that for demos, for a demo, it's often made off of the working copy.

497
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
In USA, hmm.

498
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,380
As an example, I had a demo for Umm Jarmulami when it was being released in the U.S. and

499
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,780
they hadn't finished all their translation.

500
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,300
Well, you can only play maybe two levels in it, but when I went into the XA files, it

501
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
had the...

502
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,300
I don't know how many people played Umm Jarmulami, but there was a level that was changed from

503
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,220
the Japanese to the U.S., which was she's playing in hell instead of on an island for

504
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,540
the Teriyaki-Yoko stage, but on that it had the Japanese version for the song lyrics.

505
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,540
But it had everything in there, including lists of tracks and edit information.

506
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Why is that still there? I don't know, but I'm assuming they'll probably take that out, but then again, here's another thing that we have to understand when we're looking at this list.

507
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Even if there were all those short samples, remember back in Extra Mix, there was Petite Love, the short little sample for that, and the banner, and the background stuff, but the song wasn't in there.

508
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,540
So it's possible some of the stuff might be cut out.

509
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:44,540
Very true, and didn't somebody else hack USA Mix and actually found that there's backgrounds in USA Mix for Butterfly, Bad Girls, and mostly the stuff that they cut out of Best Hits, although I gotta say, the one that was really interesting was Bad Girls because they actually found an image of the background without the gun, and Bad Girls wasn't in Best Hits either.

510
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:52,540
They also, using a GameShark, were able to have it pull up open slots for songs.

511
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Yeah, well here's my theory on why there's so many songs listed on this thing.

512
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,540
Now, especially Let Them Move. Now this is what made me wonder about this.

513
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Because they guaranteed that Let Them Move would not be in this new mix.

514
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Now, before they were talking about appending this with Konomics.

515
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,540
And if you notice, on the list, which we haven't really kind of revealed the list yet, but you know, if you've seen it on the site,

516
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:26,540
It has pretty much, I haven't confirmed this by actually going down the list with Conomics and DDR Max USA, but they're almost identical as far as the old stuff that they have.

517
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:41,540
So, my guess would be is that you can actually append Conomics with Max USA. Now, I don't know if it'll allow stuff to be playable, but that would probably be why they have these short samples on there for that.

518
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,020
We're going to find the list, but we're not going to really read the whole list for you

519
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,780
guys because obviously there's still some tricks to it.

520
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,420
It's not the final list.

521
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,340
Basically we're not going to know until either A, Konami tells us, B, a respectable, reputable

522
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:03,340
gaming site lets us know the information, or C, we have the hot little game in our hands.

523
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,200
What I do want to read off on that list is the new stuff, the new songs that they've

524
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,780
discovered because I'm guessing that's probably going to be the most accurate.

525
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,900
Why would they have information for new songs if they're not going to be in there after

526
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
all?

527
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,580
But the old stuff I'm guessing is not accurate.

528
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,300
Things like Ghost, I have a very hard time believing Ghost is going to actually be in

529
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Max USA.

530
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
I could be wrong.

531
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,860
I would love it if Ghost was in Max USA.

532
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,140
That's one of my very favorite DDR songs of all time, but I'm thinking it might be some

533
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,340
kind of copy-over for Max for Japanese, who knows?

534
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,340
That would be my guess.

535
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,720
Then again, they could be licensing it from something else.

536
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,440
So it's very hard to say, but we'll have to just wait until when it comes out for that

537
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
kind of stuff.

538
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,820
But like you said, the new stuff for sure.

539
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
Very interesting.

540
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,020
What do we got here?

541
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,520
SoCalKick sent me the hacked text file, but again, what I'm seeing on this list, it looks

542
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,300
like codes for every song that you see, but you see things in here listed in here.

543
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,660
This is that part of the text file that had all these things.

544
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:11,020
You see things that I just don't believe are going to be in Max USA, like Captain Jack

545
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,220
Grandio makes Mr. Wonderful, but look, you see these little three-letter codes before

546
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,900
each one, like FLAS for Flashdance, AFRO for Afrinova.

547
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,460
I think that might have something to do with some kind of pen mode or edit mode, I don't

548
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,540
know.

549
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,540
But who knows?

550
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
You know what?

551
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
No, Flashdance is not economics.

552
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
It's just not economy original.

553
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Why don't you take the import version and see if they also have a similar text form?

554
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,620
coding a lot smaller so that's what that is so what some new songs we see in here

555
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,980
that we haven't seen in DDR yet we've got jam and marmalade logical dash look

556
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,900
to the sky true color mix over blast which has been confirmed peace out I'm

557
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,260
for real the shining Polaris that's what I'm looking forward to drop the bomb the

558
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,140
system SF mix which by the way has been sent to me by JB in the chat room so

559
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,500
we'll play that later dynamite are the down bird soda mix take it to the

560
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,380
morning light extended vocal version you leave me alone dark black forest short

561
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:44,420
trip nemesis cool ain't it good the original vocal mix m2 step version 1.0

562
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,100
1 22 dunk 5 1 1 abyss baby baby give me your love and I like to move it well

563
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,980
that's baby bit yeah some of those so I don't know something's mixed there's

564
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:02,580
There's some other ones on there too that you didn't mention up the top there.

565
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,700
There's one of them that's going to be, well look to this guy, true color mix is going

566
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,260
to be in there.

567
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,500
Another one was, let's see, what the hell is that?

568
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,300
I don't know.

569
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:21,740
It's a dum-s-naha requiem mix, whatever the hell that is, Orion civilization, is that

570
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,520
a remix of, oh whatever, I don't know, we don't know. Anyways, it looks like possibly

571
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:33,520
an Orion 78 remix, probably not good enough. Anyways, Dark Black Force, of course, you

572
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,360
mentioned, there's a, let's see, you mentioned Drop the Bomb, there's a Do It Right remix

573
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,760
too that's in there. The Strap Battle modes. Oh, where the hell is that? Keep on moving

574
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,800
and let them know the Strap Battle version. Oh, what do we got in there? Second Mix. Let's

575
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,080
here again I think it's just a list of codes I don't think the only things I

576
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,200
see interesting about this are the new songs I don't think this list shows us

577
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,640
it really shows us what songs are going to be a max it's some kind of the

578
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,640
database who knows maybe information modes maybe yeah they have dynamite rave

579
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,480
long version in the list and oops I did it again which are songs I don't think

580
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,560
you're gonna be in there so yeah so I again we're pretty sure we'd say we're

581
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,920
about 90% confident that these new songs are reading to you will show up in max

582
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,000
USA but as for the rest what old stuffs coming back I think it's hard to say

583
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,680
from these hacked ones because again the text files they have everything in there

584
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,040
and it's a working it's a work in progress again sandstorms not in this

585
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,640
list nor the other darud song what's the other darud song you were thinking could

586
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,900
in there? Feel the beat? Feel the beat. Feel the beat is not listed either. So, we know

587
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:52,900
it's missing something. So, it's got to be a working process. So. But it is pretty interesting

588
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,600
and it does open up a lot of possibilities for things we might see. Alright, cool. What

589
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:04,140
else do we want to talk about, Max? I played the demo. Let's talk about being a measure

590
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,260
are all about all of my god what what happened wire look to the sky with the

591
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,600
beat of a measure off

592
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,380
i mean it was even a trick they were to rumor is rumor is

593
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,380
that somehow an old version of the demo got put on the demo disk

594
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,180
that they

595
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,660
they actually released a fixed to the playstation magazine people but they

596
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,140
put the wrong one on there

597
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,740
i'll be getting a lot of them

598
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,880
i don't know seems kinda

599
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,840
It's like, gosh, somebody should have known what they were doing over there, right?

600
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,040
You know, how does stuff like that happen?

601
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,220
I know I'll be getting a later issue so I can

602
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,660
confirm or deny that.

603
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,540
It's not a big thing, but...

604
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,860
But no, it was a step off, even to the point where I've been tempted to make

605
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:51,620
an edit to Let the Beat Hit Em called Let the Beat Hit Em DDR demo.

606
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,020
And now what do you think about playing Secret Rendezvous at home?

607
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,580
Pretty cool, huh? It's a winter song.

608
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,140
and then i think i would think well and that the other than the fact that i

609
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,980
don't like

610
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,460
uh... here's another one that found pretty interesting and i'm off

611
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,820
i see the damn name

612
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,260
okay dynamite are three

613
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,140
uh... down for its so it's a mix

614
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,340
and i'm very

615
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,140
i don't like going on to the other way or after because we're getting a dynamite

616
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,800
are

617
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,800
remix somewhere around

618
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,720
uh... we might

619
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,700
maybe we'll get to hear it at some point i don't know we want you as we hear the

620
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,360
drop the bomb it so i got

621
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,780
i think we should go ahead and play it we're gonna play it will play the drop

622
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,540
the bomb x and then we're gonna talk a little bit about uh...

623
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,760
we'll talk about eight style or something we're not gonna we're not

624
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,440
gonna go into full break I'm just gonna play this one song I've got to drop the

625
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,440
bomb mix I'm gonna play for you guys oh this oh it's just a clamp I thought it

626
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,800
was a full song ah shit all right well then we get to hear the clip all right

627
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,120
here we go

628
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:17,840
I like that.

629
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
That's pretty cool.

630
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
That is pretty cool.

631
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
Oh, man.

632
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,200
It's all going, it's going trancy.

633
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,480
You know what Max is going to be?

634
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,840
DDR Max is going to be one giant rave.

635
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,820
Alright, alright.

636
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,100
i know i'm gonna pick it

637
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,520
i've been wishing i mean i i kinda like dynamite are three

638
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,520
but uh... i've been hoping that they do transferring into that

639
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,740
please

640
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,440
be a trans remix not some god damn awful speed mix

641
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,280

but we love you we love you all listeners for getting us the staff

661
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,720
so yes

662
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,480
are we going to break

663
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,320
let's break stuff

664
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,720
uh... should it be uh... doing my little intro to the song here that was a i want

665
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,420
to talk about

666
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,320
eight style so we'll talk more about itself for the break in itself

667
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,680
but let's talk about

668
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,600
a two d x eight style we've got one new songs been revealed actually two new

669
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,900
songs in revealed and that those of the super secret hidden tracks which

670
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,800
apparently

671
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,160
i i don't know if this is one of the set

672
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,660
had to be detailed again to rule that you have to a beastly basically kick the

673
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,480
crap at a gopin lease you know

674
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,520
uh... you've got to uh...

675
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,740
triple-a a flashing seven song on hard

676
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,960
and then you get to play a song called sakura

677
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,960
doesn't that make you happy i'll never get to play that donald

678
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,480
uh... so you get that

679
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,440
and then if you can triple-a that

680
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,220
if you can triple-a sakura you get a mr t song called xenoan like i said you

681
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,680
have to be dj lisou

682
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,680
and we're gonna play those songs for you right now but loki

683
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,680
has a very interesting theory about sakura which is a song by revenge

684
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,680
I found this link the other day, you know, to find this song, and I listened to it, and I was like,

685
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,680
oh my god, this is Max Unlimited. This song is a remix of Max Unlimited.

686
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,680
No one is saying it is, except for me, but it's a goddamn remix of Max Unlimited.

687
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,680
It has the same bassline as Max Unlimited, almost identical to Max Unlimited.

688
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,680
I mean, if you listen to the key sounds of it, it has the exact same bassline.

689
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Listen to Max Enigma to get what I'm saying, because that's all he has playing in the background, is the bassline.

690
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,320
it has the exact same bassline, plus it's actually got a spot where they could put

691
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,640
freezes. Now what's interesting is, remember when they were talking about Max to the

692
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,160
XXXM and how they said there's gonna be two freezes in it? There's two spots in this song that

693
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,440
could put freezes for it. Also another thing

694
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,160
is there's a part where it speeds up and you'll actually hear the drum that's in

695
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,640
the background of Max Unlimited

696
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,720
and also the bassline too, and at the very end of the song there's a spot where it goes like

697
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,600
da da da, da da da, you know, that type of thing? Right. It's got that there

698
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Now don't be thrown off by the fact that it's got that twangy shit from Nisigaru and all that stuff.

699
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
That's just typical revenge blabber.

700
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,600
First of all, it's not twangy shit. It's traditional playing, so don't, you know, shit on it.

701
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Okay, it's traditional twangy shit. I'm just kidding.

702
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
I'm just saying it.

703
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
I'm just kidding to talk about it.

704
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,600
But this is my theory. This song will be the new max.

705
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Screw this max to the XXXM that this...

706
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,600
All this fucking internet rumor shit is really pissing me off.

707
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,920
So some dumb-ass Japanese guy over there comes up,

708
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,380
oh, this sounds like a good name for the next max.

709
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,580
And then puts it out there.

710
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,800
Some idiot copies that list, and then more idiots

711
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,600
copy that list.

712
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,720
And then people start taking that for fact.

713
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,760
And then we copy it.

714
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,640
You hear it here first on Orange Launch.

715
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,060
I never said that that was a song.

716
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,760
It's the dumbest name ever.

717
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,160
Sakura, OK, I am going to put my money on this song.

718
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,000
This is going to be the next max song.

719
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,280
It is the coolest name ever.

720
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,300
And it is going to be the next max song.

721
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,000
I can almost guarantee it.

722
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,200
i'm going to say actually i am going to guarantee this song will be in max three

723
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,000
if not

724
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,720
the extra stage

725
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,760
because who knows they might actually come up with some other stuff for max

726
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,880
three

727
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,540
and we got cockamamie didn't we

728
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,000
i did you can only would like to welcome you to the internet lucky

729
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,080
when it comes to the group

730
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:09,720
you know that this reminds me of the old picture hello and thank you

731
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,040
tall is yelling at us uh... we love people that

732
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,040
Sakura is a Japanese folk song with the max bass line.

733
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:24,840
Actually, that was something I played it for my fiancé, Dan, the other night, and he even

734
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,560
mentioned that he heard it in another game that had a level that had traditional music

735
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,560
playing in the background.

736
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:36,200
And actually, come to think of it, I do remember hearing it before, so that's why I'm personally

737
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,520
a little bit iffy about that theory.

738
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,520
However, I wouldn't put it beyond them to make that a bonus.

739
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,520
Now, uh, how much money are you putting on this, Loki?

740
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
I don't know, I didn't say anything about money.

741
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,520
You said you're putting your money on this, that Sakura's gonna be the hidden song.

742
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,520
My credibility, how about that?

743
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Oh!

744
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Here's what I'm saying.

745
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Your dignity?

746
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Yes, dignity.

747
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,520
And here's another thing!

748
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
It's 150 beats per minute.

749
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Oh, wait!

750
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,520
Double that, and what have we got?

751
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
300!

752
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Oh!

753
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,700
see that one coming

754
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,200
i mean come on

755
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,400
do we need to like

756
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,520
anymore clues that this is going to be the next max song

757
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,220
okay or if it's not

758
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,620
they get a really shitty ass job with creating a new song let's just take the

759
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,460
baseline from this one and throw some other stuff on top of it oh new song

760
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,100
there you go

761
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,300
i say let's just play it

762
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,720

766
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,680
kind of messed up and kind of scratchy and it's gonna mess up we haven't

767
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,520
screened this yet so we're just gonna play it live on air for the first time

rate

774
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,360
it's dynamite

775
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,480
diaries

776
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,960
area not for that

777
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,880
yeah minus the fact that it was uh... double your pleasure w fun time uh... it

778
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,500

and you might begin your wish

780
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,880
little fat more like a k o g now i think it

781
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,180
it sounded like

782
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,380
freaking european

783
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,880
all they need to do is just slow it down you know like when you're listening to

784
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,680
the song in 2DX and you put it in training mode and slow it down all the way

785
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,180
it sounds like a ska song they should do dynamite or ska

786
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:08,780
I don't wanna give up

787
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,180
alright let's get to the songs from 8 style

because jamie demands it

793
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,460
yes sounds good to me. The gax song is by the way the one that made it into

794
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,020
guitar freaks eighth mix

795
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,860

I'm not afraid of the future

812
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:09,020
I'm not afraid of the future

813
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:13,020
You don't need another voice

814
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,020
This is the end of the video.

815
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,020

You've done me another way, you've done me another way

817
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,500
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

818
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,500

819
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:03,820
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

820
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,980
You're just going to go up the street and you're going to make a ride at the Shell station

821
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,980
and you're going to...

822
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,060
Watch out, put the job box.

823
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,140
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, which is...

824
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,140
Hey you!

825
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,140
You five year old!

826
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,140
You give me your lunch money!

827
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:23,140

01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,220

829
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,860

830
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:36,060
no no more no more it didn't get picked up on microphone we can't play it

831
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:43,060
if it didn't get picked up on microphone

832
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:49,060
I love you, Jamie. I love you, guys.

833
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,060
Hey, you know what I'm learning how to do, though?

834
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,060
I'm learning how to hit the buttons right on the keyboards.

835
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,060
I can bring up that rage thing right away.

836
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,060
Rob Masters keyboard command. Film at eleven.

837
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:02,060
Anyway.

838
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:06,060
Our chat room cries every time we do that, by the way.

839
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,060
We love you, guys.

840
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:12,060
Our chat room just gets, you know, every time that somebody says the R-word,

841
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:17,060
The chat room just gets completely out of hand. They just all at once, they just start getting into it.

842
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:22,060
They just start yelling out in the chat room. They just all start crying.

843
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,060
They all start crying.

844
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:32,060
Oh, I said it.

845
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:37,060
This is never going to get old. Never.

846
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,060
It's ancient. We need to pick a new song on the show.

847
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,060
Booty!

848
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,060
Our next song on our next live show is gonna be Booty.

849
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,060
Oh, speaking of the next live show...

850
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,060
Speaking of Booty...

851
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
Our show. It's a complete booty.

852
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,060
Next week's show, this coming Sunday show...

853
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,060
Thank you.

854
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,060
Next week's show for October the 13th...

855
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,060
Ooh, lucky day there.

856
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,060
October the 13th show will be pre-taped.

857
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:12,060
So we're not going to be doing it live here in studio, so don't come to the house next Sunday because we won't be here.

858
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:18,060
We're going to pre-tape. We are going to pre-tape I don't know where. Where are we doing? We're doing Scandia?

859
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:27,060
Scandia. Thursday night, I think? Is that what we decided on Thursday night? Thursday. Thursday, Scandia? Friday's not enough time for me. I want to get out of town by Friday.

860
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,060
Thursday. And then we're going to do it Thursday night at Scandia. Sounds like a plan to me. Winner.

861
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,060
So, we will keep you guys posted on the details, though.

862
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,060
It'll be the topic in our chat room.

863
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:42,060
I'll make it the topic in our chat room and I'll post about it on sacbamani.com for the locals,

864
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,060
because only really people in Sacramento and maybe the Bay would be able to make it to a live taping anyway.

865
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,060
So, we're going to...

866
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,060
Hey, if you want to be a special guest, show up.

867
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,060
Yeah, just show up.

868
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,060
If you want to be a special guest, you're in the area.

869
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,060
And give me a dollar!

870
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,060
And if you're going to be in the Bay area, you can drive on up.

871
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,060
We'd welcome you with open arms.

872
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:05,060
You know, saying open arms makes me think of Journey.

873
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:12,060
I love how I ride to you with open eyes.

874
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,060
Hey, but we have a Journey fan in our chat room.

875
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,060
I fucking love Journey.

876
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:19,060
But you know, it makes me think, I saw this preview on VH1 today.

877
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:24,060
VH1's going to do like a hundred, the top hundred guilty pleasure songs or something like that.

878
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
And Don't Stop Believin' was in there.

879
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,060
Winner.

880
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,060
That song is winner.

881
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,060
I put that song on repeat the other night.

882
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:38,060
Okay, for people who actually read my live journal, I'm going to have to have that as my live journal song for the night.

883
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,060
Okay, good deal.

884
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:45,060
And we'll have to do our own little guilty pleasure set soon, some week.

885
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,060
We're going to have to do our TDR 2DX guilty pleasures.

886
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,060
Okay, right now I'm commissioning somebody.

887
01:06:51,060 --> 01:07:01,060
Make me this remix. Make me Dynamite R-thingy mixed with R5. It would sound good.

888
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,060
Dynamite R5.

889
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,060
Dynamite R5.

890
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,060
So would that be...

891
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,060
Yeah, okay.

892
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:17,060
Yes, Thursday is going to be all about Retro Edit Day. I'm going to bring back all the old fourth mix edits I had.

893
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,060
Cool.

894
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,060
Retro Edit Day. Hell yeah.

895
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,580
If I could come, but I probably can't because it's school. Uh-oh

896
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:31,620
No, I would totally play all the edits that are already pre-loaded onto the fourth mix machine like the B4U edit

897
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,780
They're totally rules, and there are some other ones too. I forget

898
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,700
Don't forget about the edits that are in my pocket. They have the stomp to my beat

899
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,940
So live on Thursday when we tape it Scandi

900
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,820
I'm going to see if I can make this happen, if I can get a video camera by then.

901
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,300
For those of you that were listening last week, you heard us bitching and bitching and

902
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:05,940
bitching about these ignorance, ignoramuses at twingalaxies.com, who do the world record.

903
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,660
Do they conjoin Twin Galaxies?

904
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,060
No more references to USO.

905
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:15,820
I'm not allowed to talk about this show on that show, so we have to limit it.

906
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:21,460
We're gonna quote a, nevermind, Trav if you're listening, you know you're cool.

907
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,780
But you're an asshole for not letting me talk about DDR on that show.

908
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:28,420
Hey, he talked about the Orange Lounge yesterday.

909
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,540
Yeah, he made fun of it.

910
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,980
But that's still airtight.

911
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,420
That's still promo.

912
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,940
We're gonna do that live, so it'll be rebroadcast next Sunday.

913
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:42,460
If I can get the video camera in time, we will do that over there live.

914
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,900
I hope Black Loud can get over there Thursday because I know he's probably going to get

915
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,660
the best score out of any of us that I know of that would show up.

916
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,500
We just didn't need to do the Traveling Road Show too, we need to do one from Tapioca Express

917
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:01,940
and Davis and you know we'll find that bowling alley in the movie theater in Auburn that

918
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,020
has the second mix.

919
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,340
How would that be?

920
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:09,700
Yes, this record was shattered in a Tapioca Express.

921
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,700
That would be winner.

922
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,700
Think about it.

923
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:18,380
That'd be just like seeing, you know, this record was shattered by a paraplegic in a...

924
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,620
I shattered this record while eating squid.

925
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,660
Well, the record was also set by, like, some total moron, anyway, who made up his own rules.

926
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,260
It's like, okay, here are the rules!

927
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,260
I win!

928
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,380
I'm still thinking we need to criticize the rules and send them in and to point out each

929
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,480
and every reason why they're wrong and why they're idiots.

930
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,480
Rule number seven.

931
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,480
I can only win.

932
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,480
No one else can win.

933
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
Just me.

934
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,320
D- He's ugly.

935
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,920
Chat room is getting their panties in a bunch cause we haven't done the fus yet.

936
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,560
D- So, we're gonna do the fus right now.

937
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,560
J- Cue my music!

938
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,560
D- So, Jamie-

939
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,600
J- I love this game.

940
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,600
D- I just wanted to let that little thing do the talking for you.

941
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,640
D- You know, who else likes that thing?

942
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,640
J- Roo?

943
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,100
D- Christi's two year old daughter likes that.

944
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,840
J- I just remember having a particular somebody over here humping it.

945
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,280
D- Dude, what?

946
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,520
J- Nevermind.

947
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,520
Shh! What'd Dave do?

948
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,520
Dude, you are a foul tonight.

949
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,520
You're a foul. You're gross. Okay.

950
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,520
Chili, I'm telling you. The chili and those cheese things.

951
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
Yeah. I know.

952
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,520
I can smell it.

953
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,520
Jamie, do you have any FUs of the week?

954
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,520
Of course I do. Um, as soon as I think of them.

955
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,520
Well, I have my secret FU, which none of you are going to know about.

956
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,520
A few people know about it.

957
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,300
I know I know I know the secret of you. I know it. I know it

958
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:43,000
So I'm not telling for anybody who wants to know what my secret if you is, you know, try to find me online

959
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,640
try

960
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,880
Found you you want orange lounge every Sunday night, bitch

961
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
I just forget, leave it to me.

962
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:59,880
Um, no, my other, um, other FDs that I have goes, one of them goes toward voltage, dammit.

963
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,880
You saw me play that song!

964
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
I did, I did.

965
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
You saw how damn close I was to that song.

966
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
Um, of course I'm seven feet.

967
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,880
Um, I have another one that, uh, dude, I said what my FDs were at the beginning of the show.

968
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
Dammit, I'm not giving up.

969
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,880
Oh yeah, my other fuck you goes toward, well, it's a kinda sorta one.

970
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,920
I got a job and I liked being unemployed. I like living off of my own parade for welfare

971
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,320
I was a welfare. I was an employment. It's different. You know. I'm not you know poop it out, baby

972
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,240
Lock them up in the closet feeding them you know

973
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,600
You know five-month-old the funny the funny thing is is if you ever did have a kid

974
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,600
You would fight with them over who gets to play Nintendo. You really would.

975
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Fuck them, that's mine. I fight for myself.

976
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,600
They want theirs, they can earn their money and fight themselves. Hello.

977
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Anyway, but you know, my job keeps me so busy and I have hardly any time,

978
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,600
so I'm like this zombie here in the week, and I came in the zombie today,

979
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,600
and I found, though, I do have a happy thing. I need happy music.

980
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,600
A happy thing?

981
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
I have a happy thing.

982
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Oh, happy music, happy music, happy music.

983
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,600
No, I got I got happy music. I'm just looking for it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm looking. I'm looking

984
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,600
I have the perfect I have the perfect song if I can find it. I got it. He's happy song

985
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,240
Anyway

986
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:37,720
My happy thing is I've discovered a wonderful drink get a drink to make it work. It makes me hyper

987
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:47,720
It's called taking the coffee once the coffee has been brewed and people have poured and there's about half of the container of coffee left.

988
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,720
You pour yourself a cup and add in a pack of hot chocolate.

989
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:57,720
You add in hazelnut creamer and then some sugar. Mix it up and add more coffee and that's instant go-go juice.

990
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,720
It makes you hyper for at least two hours. Top that with penguin mints to get rid of the bad breath.

991
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,720
I get my work done fast.

992
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,720
Fair enough. Any other FUs or

993
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,720
bless yous or whatever we're calling them?

994
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,720
Well, other than my secret FU, because I'm not going to be in as much of a bitch as I was earlier.

995
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,720
No. And you know, fuck that!

996
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,720
And fuck Twin Galaxies. I mean, conjoin Twin Galaxies.

997
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,720
Okay, fair enough. Fuck them. Fuck them right in their nostrils, because their ass ain't good enough.

998
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:37,720
the

999
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,420
i'm going to know why it's my turn

1000
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,680
uh... my f use the week

1001
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,140
my own job

1002
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,700
who has moved me to a new cuba that's half the size of my old one

1003
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,900
right in the middle of

1004
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,560
fast lane where everybody walks through so i can't really exactly get on the

1005
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,680
internet

1006
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,120
indiscreetly anymore so that's kinda sucks to know i'm not gonna be able to

1007
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:04,120
I might actually have to do work at work, and that's just not right.

1008
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
You can't sit on there like I do.

1009
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,120
I know, I hate you. I want your job, except you don't make as much as I do.

1010
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:16,120
I don't do anything. I download hundreds and hundreds of megs of stuff on a D1 line.

1011
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,120
Do you have to take phone calls?

1012
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Well, we're supposed to, but we don't have to. If we don't take the call, it rolls over to someone else.

1013
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,120
Damn, I want his job, because I don't like talking to people on the phone.

1014
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
Get me a job.

1015
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,120
I get tons of ammo.

1016
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:37,120
Yeah, I know. You get free shit, too. Man, I hope he's got dream job.

1017
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:42,120
Anyway, I guess that's my only F.U. of the week. I don't think I have any other F.U.s of the week.

1018
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,120
It's been a fairly okay week, I guess.

1019
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,120
F-drama.

1020
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:56,120
F-drama. My life is not passions. I am not living in passions land.

1021
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,120
How do you make my life feel like passions?

1022
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:06,120
Well, let's see. As promised from last week, I said I would have a nephew this week.

1023
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,120
Oh, okay. Yes, you have a nephew.

1024
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:18,120
Now, as much as I'd like to learn how to program my remote control and what to do if there's static on my screen and that kind of stuff,

1025
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,120
I don't like the fact that Dish Network took away all my channels.

1026
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:30,120
I would turn on the TV this morning and all the channels were locked out because they said that they did not receive payment from us, however we had already paid them.

1027
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:38,120
They suck. I have to use the Dish Network because they suck and I don't care how to program my fucking remote and what the hell it can do.

1028
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:46,120
And obviously if there was static on the screen I wouldn't know how to get rid of it because I wouldn't be able to see the stupid broadcast about how to get rid of static.

1029
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:51,120
God, I hate Dish Network, although that one chick in the commercial has a nice rack.

1030
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,120
She has a nice rack. Nice, nice rack.

1031
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:01,120
You heard it here first. The chick in the Dish Network commercial has a nice rack. And now the day.

1032
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,120
Yay. I only have a couple of FUs.

1033
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
You get the same song because I'm lazy.

1034
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
Yeah, okay. I don't want the same song anymore.

1035
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,120
Alright.

1036
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:20,120
My FUs go to 2 EX songs that I can't pass. Mainly, Safari, the shitty EX song and I hate to crap out of it.

1037
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:31,120
And Love is Dreaminess and G2. Love is Dreaminess on Seven of Stars, or Seventeen, and the other two on my Seventeen.

1038
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,120
I can't pass them, and they are hard. Very hard.

1039
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,120
Okay, that's it.

1040
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Oh

1041
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:48,000
Well, we're gonna do uh now we have our requested dedication too bad we don't have Casey case in here to do it for us

1042
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:57,280
I you know, I dedicated the dead airspace on the show to twin, but I feel kind of bad a little bit

1043
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,640
So we're going to dedicate this one song to you

1044
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:14,520
You feel special, you feel loved, good. Thank you. Can we get back to the FUs now?

1045
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,240
All right

1046
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,240
Say the R word.

1047
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
Say it! Say it!

1048
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,240
Say it!

1049
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,240
I don't want to say the word.

1050
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,240
It's a bad four-letter word.

1051
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,240
It's a bad four-letter word, okay?

1052
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,240
It's the four-letter R word.

1053
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,240
What four-letter R words are there?

1054
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,240
Rave!

1055
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,240
They knew it was coming.

1056
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:56,240
See, it's just funny, because every time someone says that, Rob throws his hands up in the air and acts like he's not, like, partying.

1057
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,240
It's so funny.

1058
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,240
Rob starts doing the club hoochie dance.

1059
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,240
I mean, this is a good thing he's not, like, standing up.

1060
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,240
I do the I-want-to-get-some-tonight dance.

1061
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:12,240
Okay, we're going to go to the chatroom FUs now.

1062
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,240
Uh, oh my god, some people just wrote some fucking novels tonight, so I'm gonna be quick.

1063
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,240
Black Lab. Well, Black Lab's cool, so I'll let him have all the FUs he wants,

1064
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,240
cause he's, he's whoring out our stations, so...

1065
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,240
Excuse me, excuse me, boys, can I do an FU here? Thank you.

1066
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,240
Uh, you wanna share with the rest of the network here?

1067
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,240
You have enough for everybody!

1068
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,240
Okay, but yesterday at Pat's party, which was awesome,

1069
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:40,240
uh, Loki brought, er, he has got the massive sim, uh, DDR DX or whatever,

1070
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:52,240
And one of the songs is by this one guy, and he basically layered his voice over and over, making all the different noises, the songs like V-X-Y and V.

1071
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,240
Yeah.

1072
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,240
We're gonna get to those.

1073
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,240
Yes, later. So, wait.

1074
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:01,240
I now have two microphones. Be scared.

1075
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:05,240
Gimme! My microphone! Here's Robert.

1076
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
Back to the FUs now please, thank you.

1077

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,240
Black Lab, our buddy, our pal, says fuck the Yankees, they deserve to lose.

Fuck the University Dining Commons for closing their dinner times at 7 p.m. and locking the doors five minutes before 7 p.m.

1082
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:35,240
Fuck my bike for getting a flat tire as I left my last class on Friday, thus forcing me to walk at a half an hour across campus back to my dorm.

1083
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:47,160
Fuck the T1 line in the dorms for being so overcrowded, 250 or so people share it, and

He was supposed to not be here tonight.

1102
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,300
He was going to go out and hang with some friends.

1103

But here he is in the chat room, sending his FUs.

He says, fuck you, Jason, who didn't drive me to Boomers to see Mike,

Ask Microsoft for getting into Licksang's business and shutting them down.

1122
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,840
Fuck the Xbox. We need more angry music, we do not need love music.

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,840
Bigger console meets better console, correct?

I'll have you know that I bought my original DDR Max Japanese version, the one I eventually sold off later on,

1128
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,840
but I originally bought that from BuyRight and I had no problems whatsoever.

1129
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,840
No, no, no, this is what BuyRight does.

1130
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,840
But yeah, I know, we know about the whole Tekken thing, so...

1131
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,080
that's all right but they're right

1132
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,120

1202
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:48,360
Baby I don't care, don't want to be alone

1203
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,360
Baby I don't care, don't want to be alone

1204
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:21,880
Every face I see is cold as ice, everything I touch is grey

1205
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,880
Ever since I lost the imagination

1206
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,880
Like a stream that flows into the sea

1207
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:35,880
I am lost for all eternity

1208
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,880
Ever since you took your love away from me

1209
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,880
Sometimes

1210
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,880
The sound of goodbye

1211
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:54,880
It's louder than any drum beat

1212
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,880
It's so dry

1213
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,880
The sky will be fine

1214
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:21,880
Louder than any strong beat

1215
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:28,880
The stars, the stars of the stars

1216
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:35,880
I know that there ain't anything wrong with me

1217
01:36:35,880 --> 01:37:02,000
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1218
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1219
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
No!

1220
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Do we care what people think of us?

1221
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
No!

1222
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1223
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Yes!

1224
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1225
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Alright we are back, this is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 15.

1226
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,800
episode number 15. We, as promised, are going to do a listless, one of our favorite segments

1227
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:38,440
on this show. Why? Because we get to make decisions. And you just have to deal with

1228
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:43,600
our list. We put it down and we say this is the best or worst ever.

1229
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,600
Our word is law.

1230
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,600
It is law.

1231
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,680
Resistance is futile.

1232
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:55,320
So, but really the final ultimate decision lies with you guys in the chat room. So, get

1233
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,320
into our chat...

1234
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,320
So don't fuck up.

1235
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:02,180
our chat room right now at IRC.eggheads.org, channel pound, Orange Lounge, and you can

1236
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:07,420
vote on our list. Basically, the way this list works, we're going to give a topic, and

1237
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:10,420
then I'm going to give three songs on that topic. We're going to give our top three,

1238
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:13,780
all the four guests here tonight, Jamie, and then Dave and Loki, we're all going to give

1239
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:14,780
their top three answers.

1240
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,780
Yes, I am the host.

1241
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,780
You're the host and the guest.

1242
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:17,780
The hostess, the hostess.

1243
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:23,580
I'm sorry, did I put you under, I meant the host, Jamie, and the guests. You can't see

1244
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:37,220
my hand motions, that's why. We're going to be revealing our top three, and then the chat

1245
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:41,580
room votes. No, then there's the elimination round. Our favorite part, what makes this

1246
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:46,220
game the best. We piss each other off. We piss each other off by taking one off the

1247
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:51,620
list. Then each one of us gets to take one off the list. And then the finalized list,

1248
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:56,100
you guys vote on and we get a top three right from there what's the topic you

1249
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:00,460
ask well it's a topical topic what so do you best like to pick your nose to know

1250
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:05,700
it is what it's it's going along with what's being in the Bemani world right

1251
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:11,100
now what Konami original song that's not already in DDR do you want horses we'll

1252
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:14,620
tell you the topic where we're damn right I'm telling them right now what

1253
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:18,300
Konami original that it hasn't already been in DDR would you most like to see

1254
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:27,300
What did you vote for on the site to determine what song should be in Max 3?

1255
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,300
Konami Original.

1256
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,300
Yes, Dave.

1257
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:30,300
Okay, so this is any...

1258
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,300
Are you Stardius?

1259
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,300
No, it's Konami Original.

1260
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,300
It has to be Konami Original.

1261
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,300
What's Konami Original mean?

1262
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,300
I'm not...

1263
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,300
Did you already make a list without Konami?

1264
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,300
I think.

1265
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,300
I don't know what the difference is between Konami Original.

1266
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,300
Oh, my God.

1267
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,300
We might have to make a list.

1268
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,300
Did you already make a list without Konami?

1269
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,300
I think. I don't know what the difference is.

1270
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:49,300
Oh my god. We might have to take another break.

1271
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,300
Okay, fine. No.

1272
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,300
Alright, fine. No breaks.

1273
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Any song in Beatmania that was by Konami, you know, Naoki or something, that hasn't already been in DDR.

1274
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:04,300
I'm trying to think if they were by Konami or not. That's the question.

1275
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,300
We'll let you know. Don't worry, Dave. We'll let you know.

1276
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,300
Why don't we start with Dave? Dave, what is your number three?

1277
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,300
Okay.

1278
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:11,300
Konami original.

1279
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,300
The number three choice is V.

1280
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,300
Good morning Dave.

1281
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,300
Is that, does that qualify?

1282
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,300
V, yes, V counts.

1283
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,300
Yay!

1284
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:17,300
Yay!

1285
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,300
Yay!

1286
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,300
That'll count.

1287
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,300
V.

1288
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,300
And it's less work for Rob to type.

1289
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,300
Yes.

1290
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,300
It's very little work for me to type.

1291
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:24,300
All right.

1292
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,300
Loki, next!

1293
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,300
All right.

1294
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:32,300
That was a very difficult decision, but I'm going to have to go with instant love.

1295
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,300
Instant love!

1296
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,300
Oh yeah!

1297
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,300
I thought that would show up.

1298
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,300
Dude, cool.

1299
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,300
No, it's not my good cool.

1300
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:41,540
I believe it's by I said dude cool. I said good cool

1301
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,940
Jamie what's your number three choice? Oh any reason why we have to ask the reasons?

1302
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:54,420
Why why instant love because you know if they've got to put let them move in there at least make it a good remix of it

1303
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,340
fair enough

1304
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,340
Dave your reason for me

1305
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:03,180
It's a good song. You know I actually have to vouch for me because for anyone who's played

1306
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:06,740
They'd pump it up.

1307
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:10,380
There basically is winter and pump it up and it's freaking amazing.

1308
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:13,060
So I fully already know what it would be like.

1309
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:21,180
So for my number three choice, I actually have to go with Release Your Mind because

1310
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:24,060
you know, I'm Tac's whore.

1311
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:25,060
Fair enough.

1312
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:27,380
Release Your Mind.

1313
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:29,020
I'm typing with one hand.

1314
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:30,020
Uh-oh.

1315
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:32,540
Better get that plastic cover ready.

1316
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:35,460
Just because TAC owns, that's it? That's your reason?

1317
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:42,060
Because I'm secretly in love with TAC. I guess it's not much of a secret anymore, is it?

1318
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:47,360
You said if for some reason chaos struck the world and it didn't end up that you and Dan

1319
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:51,540
are together forever, you said you would marry Margaret Cho and TAC. And that's it? Or is

1320
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,060
there another one? I thought there was another one.

1321
01:41:54,060 --> 01:42:01,540
It's TAC. TAC would be my hetero choice and Margaret Cho would be my lesbian choice.

1322
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:08,540
Alright, my number three choice is a rather new choice, but you know what? It owns your soul. It's V35.

1323
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:14,540
Because I fucking love that song, it's 8 style, and if you don't like it, you can suck my dick.

1324
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:17,540
Alright, Dave, your number two choice.

1325
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:21,540
Okay, my number two choice is Give Me a Sign.

1326
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:25,540
Well, check out this on my fake journey video, how much you like?

1327
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,540
Yeah, cause that song runs.

1328
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,540
I promised I wouldn't sing tonight, I'm sorry.

1329
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:31,540
And yeah, it would make a good song.

1330
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,540
That's just our little song for tonight.

1331
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:38,540
Uh, Loki, your number two choice.

1332
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:44,540
Dear Diary, today I heard someone like the song that I really didn't like.

1333
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:49,540
So I'm gonna go to America and quote, suck his dick.

1334
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:56,540
Anyways, now, my number two song would have to be, um, and you heard it during the break, VJ Army.

1335
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:57,540
BJ Army

1336
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,540
Ah, BJ Army

1337
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:03,540
Because there's already a D.W.I. for it out there already and it's an awesome song and

1338
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:07,080
it reminds me of Wild Rush because it's got a bunch of different styles of music in there

1339
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,080
kind of all blended together.

1340
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,220
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up.

1341
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,220
I like it.

1342
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,220
Thank you!

1343
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:13,220
Jamie, your number two choice.

1344
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:16,660
My number two choice.

1345
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:20,580
It would have to be more tack, Indigo Vision.

1346
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,580
Indigo Vision.

1347
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:25,900
Just because I want to do the freaking da da da da da da da da da da steps, you know.

1348
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:31,460
just be so cool fair enough my number two choice and if you don't like this I

1349
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:36,860
kill you you also heard this during the break love is orange that would be so

1350
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:42,660
awesome to dance better than others dreaminess hey now watch out that could

1351
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:53,340
be my number one you don't know fucking love love is dreaminess okay yes one

1352
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:56,340
Number one, Konami original.

1353
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:59,340
Drumroll, you hope.

1354
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,340
We'll buzz you, don't worry.

1355
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:03,340
Wow Wow 70s.

1356
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,340
Wow Wow 70s.

1357
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,340
Yeah, Sampling Masters, I think they count.

1358
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,340
Sampling Masters will count, I think.

1359
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:12,340
Okay, that would be cool just because the afros would be in the video.

1360
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:17,340
Yeah, and if you listen to it, it would make a really good song for the steps.

1361
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,340
It would go along really well.

1362
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,340
Wow Wow 70s does own.

1363
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:25,860
Loki, your number one Konami original ever, ever, ever, ever.

1364
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:30,060
I just love this song, I mean, ever since I heard it.

1365
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:38,300
Outer Limits, because Outer Limits, ah.

1366
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,900
I was hoping when you said outer that you'd say outer wall, but...

1367
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,660
Jamie, your number one.

1368
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,620
My number one.

1369
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:48,740
It's a toss up, but I'm going to have to go with Happy Hopper.

1370
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:49,740
Happy Hopper.

1371
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:59,620
It would just be insane to play, and I'm requiring that you play that during the deliberation

1372
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,500
music because I say so.

1373
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:06,140
My number one, Black Lab, you're wrong, I didn't put Summer Vacation, although that's

1374
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,140
not a bad idea.

1375
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:14,460
My number one is Flotation, oh wait, I fucked up, because that's what I really did when

1376
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,980
I submitted what song, I put Flotation.

1377
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:23,180
But no, my number one is actually 321 Stars.

1378
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:27,340
That song would own in DDR.

1379
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:31,280
And if you don't like it, poo on you.

1380
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:37,700
So our full list before we get to our favorite round, the deletion round, is V, Instant Love,

1381
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:46,220
Release Your Mind, V35, Gimme A Sign, VJ Army, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, Wow Wow 70s,

1382
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:52,100
limits happy hopper and 321 stars so now we get to do our favorite part and that

1383
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:58,420
is the deletion round so let's start with Dave Dave what song is so sucky it

1384
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:01,340
needs to come off this list

1385
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:14,620
I'm gonna poop on me but 321 star I hate you I hate you die I am gonna cut you

1386
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:18,580
but i'm not cut so many people almost uh... playing i've never known that's

1387
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,940
all the rules

1388
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,180
you want to do

1389
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:24,600
one two three four do you do you know if you play break out in one year one two

1390
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,420

1391
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:31,500
you all get on my house actually here one here one two three four equally

1392
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,060
crash

1393
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,040
anyways

1394
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,940
uh... get you

1395
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:39,560
i have to have it at the state give me a sign

1396
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,440
because

1397
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:46,840
R&B is so forth-mixed, so down with this R&B stuff.

1398
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,560
Give me a sign.

1399
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,120
Unless it's got lesbians in the video.

1400
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,920
It's gone.

1401
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,640
Yes, I should have picked Summer Vacation.

1402
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,800
Oh, well, wah.

1403
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,080
I hate to say it, because the list is getting really hard for me

1404
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,280
to choose what to take off.

1405
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:02,560
And as much as I like the song, I'd have to say Take Off, VJ Army.

1406
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,840
Shock, VJ Army.

1407
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,720
I'm actually really pissed off at that song right now, anyway.

1408
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:08,560
What's left?

1409
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,120
we've got all these pretty good decent songs left

1410
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:15,760
uh...

1411
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,640
i don't know this is too hard i can't decide

1412
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,160
i'm going to take off

1413
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:26,460
i'm going to be a complete asshole

1414
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:30,920
i'd just i'm sorry i don't see this song in ddr no matter what you say

1415
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,940
no matter what you compare it to

1416
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,300
i just don't see the song in ddr

1417
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:37,300
I'm taking off V.

1418
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:40,300
You know, it works!

1419
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,300
It's freaking evil in Pump It Up, though.

1420
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,300
I like the rest of the songs there, I just...

1421
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:50,300
V is a 2DX song, it's a keyboard mania song, it's not a DDR song for me, so...

1422
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,300
Wait till you see it in motion, that's all I have to say.

1423
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:55,300
You need to see someone play that on Pump It Up.

1424
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,300
You need to see someone play it on Pump It Up.

1425
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:00,300
Down with V.

1426
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,300
That goes back to the Vegas trip.

1427
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:04,300
I'm just taking out my personal frustrations out on V, too, because I can't pass it still.

1428
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:11,300
That just goes back to the DDR Freak Moderator's Vegas trip. We're watching Blue, you know, practically full combo it.

1429
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:16,300
I'm going to be laughing on Wednesday when they announce V as the new song in DDR Max 3.

1430
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,300
I will be cheering that day.

1431
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:24,300
I'm just going to, you're going to see me post on the board instantly and just go, ah, very ironic there. Okay, anyways.

1432
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:27,300
And I'll just say, fuck you.

1433
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,300
We'll be like, heh heh!

1434
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:41,300
So, here's the full list. I'm posting it to the chat room right now and then you can send me your votes, except I'm having to clear out the messages I've already gotten here. I've got to clear these out.

1435
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:46,300
Okay, here we go. Here's your choices. You want to read that off, Jamie?

1436
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:49,300
Of course, as soon as you pull the thing up and un-dark it.

1437
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:57,900
We have Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, WellWow70s

1438
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,660
Afro, Outer Limits, and Happy Hopper.

1439
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:03,840
And on a personal note, I'd just like to say that everything that I picked is still there.

1440
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,840
You know what though?

1441
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:05,840
You know what though?

1442
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,500
Honestly, Jim, now that I'm looking at the list again, I probably should have taken off

1443
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,860
Release Your Mind, I think, now that I'm looking at it.

1444
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:10,860
But oh well.

1445
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:11,860
Too late.

1446
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,860
What's done is done.

1447
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:18,900
I did V. So send me your votes over private message, and you've only got a minute and

1448
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,980
to have to do it, because we've got to hurry up and end this show, because I've got to

1449
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:26,940
get out of town. So, we're going to play Happy Hopper, because Jamie said so, and we'll be

1450
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,940
We'll be right back, cause you only got a minute and a half, so I don't know if it was now, now, now, now, now.

1451
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:00,940
Every night, a little every night

1452
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:04,940
Oh, every day was of every theme

1453
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:08,940
Every night, a little every night

1454
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:14,940
Oh, every day was of every theme

1455
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:22,940
Hachi de ustedashi kamebo setu

1456
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:54,940
You are my sunshine

1457
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,940
You are my sunshine

1458
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,940
You are my moonlight

1459
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:00,940
You are my heart

1460
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,940
You are my dream

1461
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,940
YEAH!

1462
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:36,940
Every night

1463
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,940
I hear your voice

1464
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:43,940
Baby, every day

1465
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:47,940
And every night

1466
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,940
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor,

1467
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,940
what do you think of the Orange Dance for the Money Music and More show?

1468
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:08,940
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1469
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:10,940
It's unearthly.

1470
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:15,940
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1471
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:17,940
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1472
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:20,940
We're back to wrap up this little train wreck we've got going,

1473
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,940
and we're going to do that by revealing the top three winners.

1474
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:28,940
And we had a pretty good tie going there for a while, but we did resolve it.

1475
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:31,940
It did resolve. We have four songs all tied to one point.

1476
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:32,940
Yes.

1477
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:37,940
But we had somebody change their vote, which really kind of just did it right there.

1478
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,940
It kind of broke all the ties we had.

1479
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:41,940
And now we have the final list.

1480
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:47,940
This is the Konami original we most want to see in Max 3 through the voting.

1481
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:50,940
Wow Wow 70s is in third place.

1482
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,940
Yay.

1483
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:52,940
Afro.

1484
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:53,940
Afro.

1485
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:56,940
In second place, Outer Limits.

1486
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:58,940
Yay!

1487
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,940
Oh, I sense a personal grudge.

1488
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,940
You're just pissed because I took V off.

1489
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:07,940
Bitch.

1490
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,940
In first place...

1491
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,940
This is the only drumroll I have, so deal with it.

1492
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:15,940
Happy Hopper wins!

1493
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,940
Because I roll and I have good taste.

1494
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,940
Happy Hopper is the...

1495
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:25,940
And you know, we're actually somewhat unsure if that's economy original, aren't we?

1496
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:29,540
Kind of unsure, but we're just going to say it is.

1497
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:31,580
I would like to play Tetris while playing Happy Hopper.

1498
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:36,100
It wins, so Happy Hopper wins, because we said so.

1499
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:36,860
We said so.

1500
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:40,140
So we're going to have to kind of wrap up the show here.

1501
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:42,580
We're coming into the last home stretch here.

1502
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:44,740
Just want to remind everybody that Sunday's show

1503
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,500
will be pre-taped.

1504
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,620
Come on into the chat room.

1505
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:50,100
Our regulars will be there and talking about the pre-taped

1506
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,060
show as it's going on.

1507
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,120
If you live in the Sacramento or Bay Area,

1508
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,620
join us at Sacramento Scandi.

1509
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:59,580
I believe that's going to be Thursday night, but please, please check the forums on sacbamani.com

1510
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:00,580
for any changes.

1511
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,580
Um, Chat Room, praise y'all?

1512
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:06,000
No, praise me.

1513
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,820
And Instant Love came in fourth.

1514
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:11,000
Instant Love was the one that was also tied in there, by the way, but somebody changed

1515
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,060
their vote from Instant Love to something else.

1516
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:13,420
It was winning for a while.

1517
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:16,780
Yeah, it was winning for a while, and then a bunch of people changed their votes, so

1518
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:17,780
whatever.

1519
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,780
You guys are interesting.

1520
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:19,780
Sorry, DJ Konami.

1521
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,780
Sorry.

1522
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,780
We still love you.

1523
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:23,300
DJ Konami was the only one that ended up voting for Instant Love.

1524
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,380
else to change our votes.

1525
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:27,260
Yes, the dance floor is waiting for you.

1526
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:30,140
Another reminder, I'd like to also apologize.

1527
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:32,020
Thursday's rebroadcast didn't happen.

1528
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:34,980
That was my fault, because work got in the way

1529
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:37,140
and I wasn't able to queue up the replay in time.

1530
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:38,180
So I apologize to those of you that

1531
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,100
were listening Thursday for the rebroadcast.

1532
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,780
But we will do this Thursday's rebroadcast at 2 PM,

1533
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:48,140
along with our Monday broadcast at 7 PM, our rebroadcast.

1534
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:52,500
And Saturday, there will be no Orange Lounge at all,

1535
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,700
because Live 365 will be down.

1536
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:58,020
So every Live 365 station will be off air that night.

1537
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:00,220
They're moving to an underground bunker server.

1538
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,700
Yes, they're moving to an underground bunker

1539
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:04,500
so that Britney Spears and all those people doing

1540
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,940
the commercials, Stevie Wonder and all them can't get to them.

1541
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:09,700
Yeah, Stevie Wonder can't find us.

1542
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:12,820
Dude, Britney Spears is a rabbit, she'll bite one of them.

1543
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,740
And give them herpes.

1544
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:17,300
Or herpes.

1545
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:20,220
Also known as cold source, no, I don't think so.

1546
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:23,220
She's going to give them little icky-crawly things.

1547
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,220
Ew!

1548
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,220
Oops!

1549
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,220
I did it again.

1550
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:27,220
What can I say?

1551
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:28,220
Um...

1552
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:29,220
Gosh, what else?

1553
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:35,300
Remember, you can get an STD by playing DDR Max.

1554
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:38,220
We got to get this thing wrapped up, so some final thoughts?

1555
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:39,220
Jamie, you got any...

1556
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:40,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

1557
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:41,220
You have an oo.

1558
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:42,220
You have an oo, Matt?

1559
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:46,900
Where are we going to play the stupid song?

1560
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,580
We're going to have to bump that to next week.

1561
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:49,580
Okay.

1562
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:53,100
We were talking too long about, I don't know, what were we talking too long about?

1563
01:56:53,100 --> 01:57:00,420
Dear Diary, I made the Stupid American Show last too long because my segment was just

1564
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,420
as mental.

1565
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:05,820
Yeah, we bitched about DDR Max USA for too long and all that controversy going on there.

1566
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,180
And don't forget about conjoined twin galaxies.

1567
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:14,300
Yeah, and while we're queuing up the end of the show here, some update, nothing really

1568
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:15,300
going on.

1569
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:20,180
the DDR, or the Dancing Stage Hero Mix 2 DWIs out there, so look for them, find them, they're

1570
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:25,460
pretty fun to play, really easy. Other than that, DDR spot's still down, still waiting

1571
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:29,740
for them to come up, I don't know why. I should have asked, you know, Mike Noah's in town,

1572
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:32,740
I should have asked him, because he was right there, but I didn't even think to ask. I missed

1573
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:36,940
that site. My bad. So that's down, really the only other news that we have to wait for

1574
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:41,620
is, you know, what new song's going to be announced on Wednesday. That's about it. Pretty

1575
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:48,620
Okay, any final thoughts from you, Dave?

1576
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:55,620
T'Chaka owns, and my word of the week is philosophical, because if you were at the party last night,

1577
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,620
you know what I mean.

1578
01:57:57,620 --> 01:58:01,620
Yes, and I'd also like to announce that I'll be doing news on Team Guilo now that they're

1579
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:02,620
back up.

1580
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:03,620
Yay!

1581
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,620
Does that make you a member of Team Guilo, or is that what you're doing news?

1582
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:06,620
I never understood how their team works.

1583
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,620
They should have given me stickers and bribed me with stickers and stuff.

1584
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:10,620
Well, that's cool.

1585
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,780
i don't know they had to

1586
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:15,980
you gotta work in some plugs for orange launch okay good boy

1587
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,220
all right we like them we like getting plugs

1588
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:23,220
and uh... my final thought of the week

1589
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:24,740
uh...

1590
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:27,740
uh...

1591
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:31,740
uh...

1592
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,740
uh...

1593
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:38,740
uh...

1594
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:52,020
I was patting, we were just scrubbing, and patting, and hah, hah, hah, don't hurt me.

1595
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:55,500
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1596
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,300
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1597
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:05,700
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts,

1598
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:07,380
also known as Sky.

1599
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:11,660
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1600
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:15,060
If you like guns, if you like shooting, if you like action, and if you're going to rent

1601
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:19,660
the movies, rent them at Tam's Video on Irving and 22nd.

1602
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,660
What is your membership number?

1603
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:23,660
I don't know.

1604
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:32,660
I don't know is your membership number?

1605
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:43,460
Because I don't believe you've really had the San Francisco experience until you've

1606
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:50,100
been abused by a Chinese person.

1607
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:54,540
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
