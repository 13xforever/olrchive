[SPEAKER_11]: Put it in!

00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:10,847

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,061
Boring!

7
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,148

[SPEAKER_13]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:11,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

15
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:15,277
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of people and assholes.

16
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:16,377
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

17
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,679
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,680
[SPEAKER_00]: He's good.

19
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Missed it by that much.

20
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,463
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Dr. Evil's cat.

21
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:25,444
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you tell?

22
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:26,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I never forget a pussy.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

24
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,153
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura I hate nature!

25
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wish the world would explode!

26
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:59,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I could take over hell!

27
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky Do I look like the weather girl?

28
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:02,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything alright?

29
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:03,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:10,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 15 for October the 6th of 2002.

31
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:16,982
[SPEAKER_09]: You're tuned into the Bimani Sing's most super-duper radio station of all things Bimani.

32
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,284
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

33
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me as always is our resident Happy Bunny.

34
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:24,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

35
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,050
Hi.

36
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound so weak tonight.

37
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound weakened.

38
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:30,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

39
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,916
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura needs food badly.

40
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I had cupcakes.

41
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:35,458
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my crack.

42
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have vanilla crack.

43
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had nothing.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a ho-ho?

45
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:41,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need no ho, thank you.

46
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,089
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you calling a ho-ho?

47
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:49,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I can lay for free.

48
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I can already tell it's going to be one of those nights.

49
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Small, intimate little gathering tonight.

50
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got our loyals here.

51
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Loki, who I don't think has missed a show yet.

52
00:02:59,147 --> 00:02:59,887
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I have not.

53
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:00,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so cool.

54
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:04,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki, by the way, knows how to kiss some host ass.

55
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,569
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get into that later in the show.

56
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:10,770
[SPEAKER_09]: How Loki won some major brownie points with Jamie and I tonight.

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, there's the always running into the last second he possibly can.

58
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave, how you doing?

59
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:17,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not my fault.

60
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:23,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to go earlier, but my dad's like, hell no, I'm watching football game.

61
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, that's a soft drone.

62
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:25,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

63
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:26,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, that's a soft drone.

64
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,195
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

65
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:37,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we'll be talking to everybody else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do some more of Jamie's picks.

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,040
[SPEAKER_09]: That whole last hour was just nothing but Jamie picks.

67
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's special.

68
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,081
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing more Jamie picks.

69
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,061
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it special, Jamie?

70
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,902
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular one is one that I talked about last week.

71
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:51,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically Osamu Kubota and Tack live doing Presto and Era.

72
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:58,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one after that is a song that's from Beatmania Final.

73
00:03:59,125 --> 00:03:59,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Naoki track.

74
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:01,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds very good.

75
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:02,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to hear those.

76
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And later on, we're going to be talking lots and lots and lots about Max USA.

77
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Tons of news on that coming up.

78
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:10,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll talk about 8th Style.

79
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:14,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we can get Naoki Journals, your FUs of the week, and just a ton of shit tonight.

80
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:15,865
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell everybody to listen.

81
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:18,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

82
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:19,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Diary.

83
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary.

84
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge is cool.

85
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:45,707
Thanks for watching!

86
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:29,076

Thank you for watching!

90
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:09,883
Thanks for watching!

91
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:08,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, Ash!

92
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,732
[SPEAKER_12]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

93
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was very random.

94
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:17,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

95
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:19,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, Ash.

96
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,456
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Jazz in the chat room tonight.

97
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:22,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

98
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:24,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

99
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello to everybody.

100
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very glad to have you back in the chat room.

101
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello to everybody in our chat room.

102
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got lots of people in there tonight.

103
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:44,159
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to join our chat room, you've just got to go to any OtherSideIRC server like irc.eggheads.org or carma.othersideirc.net and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

104
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And we expect you a nice play again.

105
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

106
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wow.

107
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:52,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, big...

108
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,034
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

109
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's transition our way into the show here.

110
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Dad's going to go into my fuck you of the week, so we should hold on to that.

111
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tease our show, because we usually do fuck you's of the week, like, first thing right away.

112
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:03,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tease them.

113
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:06,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to do it maybe the second half of the show, just because I feel like it.

114
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel like doing the fuck you's right now.

115
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:09,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're evil.

116
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to make you wait.

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some thank you's of the week, though.

118
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got plenty of happy news for this week.

119
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:17,661
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't need happy.

120
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:18,818
[SPEAKER_17]: We need pissy.

121
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be happy.

122
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:27,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got lots of happy news to... Well, as we mentioned before we went to break, Loki knows how to kiss some host ass around the show.

123
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Got Jamie and I some advanced copies of Notorious CHO on tape.

124
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:32,990
[SPEAKER_09]: How cool is that?

125
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:34,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you!

126
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And what else?

127
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:56,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Walgreens.

128
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:26,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Last Minute Junk Food around about 15 minutes before I came here.

129
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And Vanilla Crack.

130
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, Vanilla Coke.

131
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:31,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was something else I wanted to thank.

132
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:32,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what it was, though.

133
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to thank Air for being there for me to breathe.

134
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob wanted to thank me for being beautiful and inspirational.

135
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like a muse.

136
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:48,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Here he comes, Mr. Orange Lounge.

137
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:54,476
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, that's the only time you're going to hear me sing on this show.

138
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you do your Let Them Move Elmo mix.

139
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:00,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

140
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That's old school.

141
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That is old school.

142
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't done the Let Them Move Elmo mix.

143
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:10,806
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason I don't do the Let Them Move Elmo mix on this show, because I know Twen would get a hold of it and make some nasty remix out of it.

144
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:14,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm just withholding the Elmo bit.

145
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:14,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

146
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the news about DDR, Bimani.

147
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:20,472
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

148
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,093
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week in the Bimani world?

149
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard you had some accomplishments this week.

150
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:31,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, I tried to stop counting how many 9-footers I was doing, but I'm still kind of excited about it because I did so many in a row.

151
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally owned Twilight Zone.

152
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:39,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me being the big idiot that I am, decided to do So Deep, and my legs gave out from under me.

153
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:41,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty far though, I was watching you do that.

154
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:46,057
[SPEAKER_09]: We were all, like, I don't know if you know, but Irene, myself, and Brad, we were all kind of huddled in the corner watching you do it.

155
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,439
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, oh, oh, oh, oh!

156
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: My legs actually, you know when you get so tired that your legs just get really stiff after playing DDR?

157
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened to me and I could not move, I actually had to grab the bar.

158
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:04,669
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, the bar for me, I usually treat it like it's, you know, made out of feces or something.

159
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, accomplishments, I passed two seven stars on 2DX, yay.

160
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:13,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolute and Buffalo, and they were cool.

161
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:13,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Buffalo!

162
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that song was cool.

163
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:19,577
[SPEAKER_10]: But I tried many more, but I failed them all.

164
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not good enough yet.

165
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:23,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Not until I can pass all of them.

166
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:25,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Be for you, another.

167
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Try Y31.

168
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:29,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Y31 is easy, try it.

169
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,638
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't have it yet.

170
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I was very, very happy today.

171
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:36,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I passed a 7-star in 2DX and I wanted to pass it for a long, long time at sync.

172
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:39,664
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did Summer Vacation a couple days ago, too, which is Flashing 7.

173
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: That made me happy.

174
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:41,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently my controller is blessed.

175
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:44,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Your controller is the bomb diggity.

176
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:48,956
[SPEAKER_03]: My 2DX controller kicks everybody else's controller's ass.

177
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm still pissed off about my arcade controller.

178
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:52,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

179
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:56,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Because KonamiStyle hasn't emailed me back to let me know it's being re-delivered.

180
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:57,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Konami!

181
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, we're not there yet.

182
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, why does your controller kick ass?

183
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my controller has magical powers.

184
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:06,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only pass Summer Vacation on her controller.

185
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:07,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do it on my own controller.

186
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:11,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only do it on hers, because hers goes clacky-clacky-clack, and mine just goes...

187
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: My controller stuck for like a week and then I bitched at it and it unstuck and has been beautiful ever since.

188
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:33,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because I was playing on Scott, White Freestyle or whatever, his 2DX controller and he said that he like shaved it down or something and it worked perfectly.

189
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:34,135
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty cool.

190
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not raping my controller yet.

191
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know, but it worked and it didn't stick at all, so.

192
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:52,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm scared to open up my controller and give it an operation, because I don't know, if you ever played that game Operation, I was so horrible at it, and I'm afraid I'd do the same thing to my 2DX controller, that the big red light would go off and go... Let me fix your controller.

193
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're going to fix my controller?

194
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I will use the power of my bitchiness on your controller.

195
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put the fear of me into your controller.

196
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:06,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you just going to lay it on the ground and just go... I command thee to work!

197
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:07,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Be healed!

198
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,512
[SPEAKER_07]: The power of Christ compels thee.

199
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,772
[SPEAKER_07]: The power of Christ compels thee.

200
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Demon be gone from this controller.

201
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope my roommate didn't decide to go to bed early tonight.

202
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, good.

203
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Good thing.

204
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,636
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's smart, he got out of the house.

205
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

206
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see him.

207
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:34,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm getting a suggestion in the chatroom that when I play Operation, I should take out the battery and I'll win every time.

208
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, winner.

209
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I do?

210
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:36,940
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

211
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I pick up the thing and dump it upside down.

212
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if you could do that with patience.

213
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be a doctor, Jamie.

214
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:48,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd make tons of money.

215
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

216
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,568
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to say hi.

217
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,591
[SPEAKER_09]: A big special hello to our buddy, Sharks Girl.

218
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, wifey poo.

219
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:00,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for you, baby.

220
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Rose.

221
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Diary, I've got a donut with your name on it.

222
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel all tingly.

223
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:12,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to talk Bomani tonight.

224
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just sit here and ramble.

225
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:18,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Diary, I decided that I was going to be a hockey fan.

226
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

227
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I swear to God, Naoki and Michael Jackson have got close relatives.

228
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're both hideously feminine.

229
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:33,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the rumor that Naoki was supposed to be one of the hidden members of B4U?

230
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still convinced that he's a woman.

231
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:40,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

232
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,834
[SPEAKER_19]: That burp was brought to you by a vanilla Coke.

233
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:47,056
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got that chili flavoring to it that I had earlier today.

234
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's all over the mic.

235
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:51,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew, it's Rob's mic.

236
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Del Taco.

237
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Del Taco owns.

238
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,080
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I want to say.

239
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

240
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:58,019
[SPEAKER_03]: All you people who ate real food today.

241
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a donut, string cheese, and cupcakes.

242
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:04,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Whee!

243
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, and the all-important bottle of Propel.

244
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:18,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the supermodel diet right now, where I have a cigarette for breakfast and two shots of tequila for dinner.

245
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,891
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying, Dave?

246
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:28,095
[SPEAKER_10]: For the sake of internet radio, I say that we get back to anything relevant.

247
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:28,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, fuck him.

248
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:29,896
[SPEAKER_09]: No, fuck Bomani.

249
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:30,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop playing DDR.

250
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:31,677
[SPEAKER_09]: That's our advice.

251
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:32,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your life back.

252
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Save your podiatrist the trouble.

253
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:36,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't turn out like us.

254
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:38,495
[SPEAKER_19]: We're nerds.

255
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:39,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Help us.

256
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:45,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, yesterday, went to an awesome party for Pat.

257
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:48,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Pat's cool.

258
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed going.

259
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:50,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to go.

260
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:51,718
[SPEAKER_08]: His birthday.

261
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,379
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went and we played the DDR sim, of course.

262
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,299
[SPEAKER_08]: The giant DDR sim.

263
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,460
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about Super Shuffle.

264
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Shuffle.

265
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you've ever wondered what is... What, pray tell, is Super Shuffle?

266
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Shuffle is what Shuffle should be.

267
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,889
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where every single step is random.

268
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what's fun is Shuffle works in doubles.

269
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,019
[SPEAKER_08]: So playing Super Shuffle in doubles is like playing Twister.

270
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,942
[SPEAKER_10]: No, and see how Freeze Arrows work is...

271
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Freeze arrows are set when the next arrow comes up.

272
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:29,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So normally in a song, they have the specific ending, and then the next note comes up under it.

273
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,992
[SPEAKER_10]: But since there's no note coming up under it, the freeze arrow just keeps going.

274
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:36,054
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have to hold, in doubles, eight freeze arrows.

275
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened last night.

276
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott had to hold all eight arrows.

277
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:43,218
[SPEAKER_10]: He failed that song, but it was funny.

278
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you have an orgy on the dance pad.

279
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:50,420
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, Loki, I'm not playing on your metal pads again until you get the Spider Stomp sim.

280
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock on!

281
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Spider Stomp!

282
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:54,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Blamati, it's all about Spider Stomp.

283
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:00,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hi-ho on doubles is actually pretty much like Spider Stomp, it's just all jumping.

284
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:08,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you imagine how fucking horrible Golfland would be if, well, you know, even more so Golfland horrible?

285
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

286
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:28,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Even more so if fucking DDR spat out tickets Dude, I would be walking out of there with scooters every day I know, but think about just how horrible the lines would be If DDR spat out tickets, it's over, I quit

287
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how much free, useless shit that we have?

288
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:44,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'd have a million little blinking Raver lights, and like five skateboards, and oh my god, I'd spend so much money on that game, even if I only got one ticket for every time I played, I'd still have a ton of shit.

289
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about time they give me something back for the money I spent on that damn thing.

290
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:51,584
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you get it.

291
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Dave.

292
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Did somebody say Raver?

293
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Did somebody say Raver?

294
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:01,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like being in a rave!

295
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Did somebody say rave-er?

296
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:07,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw yeah!

297
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys!

298
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:10,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you!

299
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, I love you Jamie!

300
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, give me a uh, man!

301
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, this is some good shit!

302
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:21,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's get this train back on the rails here.

303
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:28,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Should we talk about... This is what we get for having all that sugar before the show.

304
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:33,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I didn't, see, so... Should we talk about the weekly... You ate Cheetos, those are weak sauce.

305
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:34,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

306
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,450
[SPEAKER_08]: They're orange, it's themed.

307
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

308
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,052
[SPEAKER_09]: From now on, whenever anyone starts talking about raves on this show, I'm going to play Sandstorm.

309
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming to a max, USA near you.

310
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:45,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We think.

311
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:45,854
[SPEAKER_09]: We're pretty sure.

312
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:46,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope.

313
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's confirmed, damn it.

314
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:50,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So, none of that.

315
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, your little precious update.

316
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, our update.

317
00:21:56,602 --> 00:22:01,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Naoki spouted off his little crap today, but we didn't really care about what he had to say.

318
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:08,170
[SPEAKER_08]: All we cared about is the new information about DDR Max 3, which is that non-stop modes will be making a return.

319
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hooray for non-stops, I guess.

320
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:15,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I guess that'll be fun.

321
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:27,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, going to be, actually, not really news yet, but it's coming, is next week they're going to announce what song won the vote for, that's actually going to be in Max 3.

322
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: One song?

323
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:30,148
[SPEAKER_09]: One song is going to win the vote?

324
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:33,429
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're announcing one song next week.

325
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to continually announce songs each coming week.

326
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:53,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So next Wednesday, okay, I believe it's the 9th, they will have the next song for DDR Max 3, which I've heard is going to be Let Them Move.

327
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:55,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

328
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Saying rave in the chatroom doesn't count.

329
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be in the studio, so quit it.

330
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, quit playing with the ferret.

331
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:14,788
[SPEAKER_09]: There's celebration in the chatroom saying, yay, I won't fail Oni courses with 3.1 anymore because non-stops are back.

332
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

333
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,611
[SPEAKER_09]: What song do you think will be announced?

334
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,713
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think the first Oni original will be?

335
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:22,875
[SPEAKER_09]: V?

336
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:22,915
[SPEAKER_09]: V?

337
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:26,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be V. That's where my money is.

338
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope, I'm praying, that it's Instant Love.

339
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:33,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Instant Love!

340
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:37,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'll have you know, I voted for that.

341
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if it is, I'd be so pleased.

342
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be me.

343
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Instant Love, clear cookies.

344
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:43,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Instant Love, clear cookies.

345
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Instant Love, clear cookies.

346
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, I'm such a fucking retard, okay?

347
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:48,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to the site to vote for a song.

348
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted for Flotation.

349
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Flotation.

350
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:56,093
[SPEAKER_09]: The Beginning of a Prologue

351
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:15,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

352
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Second mix represents the beginning of Naoki.

353
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,412
[SPEAKER_08]: What about first mix?

354
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:21,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that not Naoki?

355
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:23,656
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I've been saying this.

356
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm brilliant to you.

357
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:26,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Naoki in a dress.

358
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:29,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, man Naoki.

359
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:29,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

360
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So, because of Brilliant To You, a song which quickly gained support of DDR players during its production.

361
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,126
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the best song ever.

362
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:41,409
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because it was like one of the eight songs on second mix.

363
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so, gained the support of DDR players during the production.

364
00:24:47,374 --> 00:24:54,140
[SPEAKER_08]: In respect to music producer who played a large part in its production, you credited the song in your own name, Naoki.

365
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, is he talking in third person now?

366
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the song expresses you perfectly.

367
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the kind of song that makes a very pleasant sensation.

368
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:08,603
[SPEAKER_08]: As if the bewitched melody of synths is flowing from the very center of your body.

369
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:18,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to interrupt for a second just to say, if you don't like second mix, if second mix does not own your soul, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you a hundred times over.

370
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:21,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Second mix is ownage.

371
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie and I say so, therefore it is true.

372
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:24,368
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

373
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we're on the radio, you have to believe everything you hear.

374
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:29,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Strictly business, like what?

375
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,589
[SPEAKER_03]: No, brilliancy, orchestra, groove.

376
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking tub thumping, that's all I have to say.

377
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:36,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Best freestyle ever.

378
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:37,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

379
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:42,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I'll never forget the pleasant sensation held by this song.

380
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I try to continue...

381
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to continue reproducing it.

382
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:52,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Incidentally, next time I feel I achieved this was in Dynamite Rave.

383
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,850
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no surprise.

384
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,571
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no surprise.

385
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:55,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

386
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:58,471
[SPEAKER_08]: We did say Rave.

387
00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

388
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

389
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:01,652
You said Rave.

390
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:03,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

391
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:04,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

392
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:05,872
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so sweet.

393
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:06,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

394
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

395
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm seeing so many colors, man.

396
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:10,673
[SPEAKER_06]: This DJ.

397
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:11,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love the DJ.

398
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, praise the DJ.

399
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:13,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

400
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:14,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.

401
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what the hell just happened?

402
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a word of the day.

403
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a word of the day.

404
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:36,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And whenever the word is said, we play that song, coming to a USA mix near you, and have our own little... The magic word is rave.

405
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave now, save yourselves.

406
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:51,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, back to the Naughty Diary.

407
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:52,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to where I was going here.

408
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:53,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see here.

409
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the second mix, music technology hasn't advanced, but your range of songs is much wider.

410
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:11,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Listening to the soundtrack... Your stupid rave stuff is throwing me... He said it, he said it!

411
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,076
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

412
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:13,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait.

413
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:16,297
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

414
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:16,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my...

415
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,396
[SPEAKER_19]: from now on it's just going to be called Dynamite R3

416
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good, okay.

417
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's see here.

418
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:38,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Listening to the soundtrack now, how do you think that has evolved since these early roots?

419
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:46,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking back and reflecting on music, second mix, it brings to mind songs like Higher, Baby Give Me Your Love from fourth mix.

420
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,316
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, these songs feel like second mix.

421
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really noticed any... Okay, whatever.

422
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there's a strong connection between the music in these two games.

423
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's the same game.

424
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same guy making it.

425
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:03,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, time has shown that Second Mix was a huge success.

426
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,991
[SPEAKER_08]: The Second Mix soundtrack CD sold over 550,000 copies, all for Butterfly.

427
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, all for Butterfly and that Dynamite R3.

428
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:18,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so with the success of... Third mix.

429
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:19,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

430
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:24,221
[SPEAKER_08]: With the success of second mix, Lifting My Spirits, everything seemed to pass very quickly.

431
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:30,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And before I knew it, I was working on solo bass mix, third mix, and True Kiss Destinations all at once.

432
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,568
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR was really starting to take off.

433
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,009
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

434
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,691
[SPEAKER_09]: What did he write for True Kiss Destination?

435
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that all their own stuff?

436
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,407
[SPEAKER_08]: True Kiss Destination had Sexy Planet and Celebrate Night.

437
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:44,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it backwards.

438
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that the other one, Dreams Come True, had the Naoki tracks in it.

439
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, Dreams Come True sucks.

440
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,211
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a good Beatmania mix.

441
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Good point.

442
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:56,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good point made in the chat room.

443
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:59,256
[SPEAKER_09]: 550,000 sold, 1 billion pirated.

444
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, some more stuff about the non-stop.

445
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:16,370
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got, it's going to be four songs in one chorus, a life gauge, just like normal non-stops, and it looks like the highest score you can get is 100 million points.

446
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,451
[SPEAKER_08]: How many pirated copies?

447
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:18,332
[SPEAKER_08]: The second mixer award.

448
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:18,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

449
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:21,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I had mine on Dreamcast.

450
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:25,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that guy that holds the world record is going to get 101 million.

451
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:27,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, dude.

452
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:34,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Twin Galaxies world record holder is going to get 300 points, and he's going to be the fucking world record holder.

453
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:39,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's, okay, and then on Naoki's little journal there's some other crap.

454
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:41,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is about.

455
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like how you play with freeze arrows or something.

456
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:46,317
[SPEAKER_09]: It's how to dance like Naoki.

457
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:47,998
[SPEAKER_09]: You okay?

458
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:49,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna find what?

459
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're gonna find the translator?

460
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to go to break or something?

461
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:59,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it looks like it has something to do with the use of freeze arrows, like how they're inputted into the game.

462
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to come back with a translation of this after our next break.

463
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,769
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pointless information.

464
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,489
[SPEAKER_08]: No one cares.

465
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:07,693
[SPEAKER_08]: We can see by what Afro is doing, he is playing with a blank screen.

466
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:09,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously he's not too smart to begin with.

467
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:12,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't really care what's going on there either.

468
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:17,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they have some stupid like, oh, this is a logo for Secret Rendezvous that didn't make the game.

469
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, cry.

470
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:19,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't care.

471
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:19,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

472
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:20,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Sniff.

473
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I kinda like that logo, it looks like it's pavement.

474
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this game is hitting the pavement.

475
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:30,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Pavement, girls on couch.

476
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Pavement, girls on couch.

477
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a country couch!

478
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Girls on pavement.

479
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're getting somewhere.

480
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Their house could have pavement on the floor, okay?

481
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:47,245
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't show the floor, they just showed the couch with the girls.

482
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:48,585
[SPEAKER_10]: So there.

483
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:53,047
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be like, wait, it can be like Night at the Roxbury.

484
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:54,928
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the inside-out nightclub.

485
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:58,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have, I almost said it, but I didn't.

486
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:00,306
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

487
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:01,347
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you all just say?

488
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:02,327
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, wait, hold on, hold on.

489
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:08,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that logo that you see before you start the song, I think that's what this was supposed to be.

490
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:14,471
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, like, before you start the song, all the logo is, it just says, you know, Secret Rendezvous written in the neon thing, and then, you know, Divas.

491
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:17,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, in that aspect, I think that logo's kind of cool.

492
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it has a little arrow drawn on it or something.

493
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:22,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that plain, but... But the lesbian video rules.

494
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:25,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

495
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:27,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Lesbian video rocks.

496
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:38,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so just, we'll have to stay tuned for next, uh, for Wednesday, actually, for Nike Journal 3, where he'll be talking about what he has for breakfast, and... His new underwear.

497
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:39,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

498
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:39,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Pauly Terry.

499
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:43,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Pauly, Pauly, Pauly Terry, and how he stalks her, and...

500
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the idea from my good friend, Mickey.

501
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:54,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, obviously, we slept together, and not together, you know what I mean?

502
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't swing that way.

503
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:03,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of secret rendezvous, we're going to kind of transition to another topic here.

504
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:13,442
[SPEAKER_09]: As you probably know, the original PlayStation Magazine demo of DDR Max USA hit shelves this week, and one of the songs in it

505
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,577
[SPEAKER_09]: is Secret Rendezvous.

506
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:21,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, one of our pals in the chat room, JB, took a really interesting picture.

507
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to show you guys.

508
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, I already lost the link.

509
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:29,163
[SPEAKER_09]: JB, post that link in the chat room once you hear the picture so I can show that.

510
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And then everybody in the chat room can see it too.

511
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:35,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a really funny picture about the demo.

512
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:37,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to show you guys as soon as JB posts the link here.

513
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully he's not a minute lagged like some of the people in our chat room.

514
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:42,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

515
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:15,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now what do you have to say about the lesbian thing?

516
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they are secret lovers.

517
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:18,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it all along.

518
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:19,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Sheesh.

519
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:22,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

520
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:23,112
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

521
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:23,613
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

522
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:23,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

523
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:24,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute.

524
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:27,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Glenn raises a very good point.

525
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:28,756
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck are we saying?

526
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:30,276
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not even in alphabetical order.

527
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:33,397
[SPEAKER_09]: That picture is obviously photoshopped by somebody, right?

528
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:34,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be?

529
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:38,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they thought it was funny too.

530
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:39,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would have to be photoshopped.

531
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me take a look.

532
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, we're easily fooled on this show.

533
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's got to be photoshopped because E doesn't come after L. Maybe not.

534
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,351
[SPEAKER_10]: It would also be funny if it was ESL.

535
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, ESL, you know.

536
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:59,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most of the people at Konami must be taking ESL.

537
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:03,473
[SPEAKER_03]: They teach it in high school.

538
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're all still in high school.

539
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:14,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, yeah, so one of the things that they did with this Max demo is they hacked into it and found the song list.

540
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:15,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

541
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:18,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually have the song list.

542
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:18,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

543
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:22,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's debatable, and this is a huge debate.

544
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to get it resolved on this show.

545
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,139
[SPEAKER_09]: There's people saying, yes, that's the list.

546
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,880
[SPEAKER_09]: There's people saying, no, that's not the list.

547
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, that's the list.

548
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:30,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And no, that's not the list.

549
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:33,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, that's... You know, it just keeps going back and forth.

550
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:34,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But... What?

551
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:35,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Theory?

552
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:36,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's hear the theory.

553
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:37,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear an interesting theory.

554
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:41,985
[SPEAKER_10]: DSCS SoCalKick says that it is fake.

555
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:42,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Again.

556
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:43,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's the list!

557
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:45,006
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not the list.

558
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:45,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's the list!

559
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And DJ Konami says, no, it's not.

560
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:53,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we just put in the demo and try it ourselves?

561
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,810
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying.

562
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, supposedly, here's how they got the list, okay?

563
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:03,834
[SPEAKER_08]: They went in to the XA file, which is the PlayStation audio format, you know, that they use.

564
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:10,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, in those, you can actually listen to the small little samples of sounds that'll play when you select a certain song.

565
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:16,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, supposedly, since they hurried to get this demo done so fast, they didn't bother to cut that out.

566
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, most average people are going to go, oh, I'm going to go hack into this and go listen for songs.

567
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what happened was that someone did that.

568
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Which just proves that people that play DDR are sick fucking people.

569
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:32,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so what happened... For any demo they're going to do, they're just going to lock out the other stuff.

570
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:33,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Or remove it.

571
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:38,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what they did was they went in there and actually listened to all that.

572
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm not sure if there was an actual song list.

573
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe that there was an actual song list there.

574
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:45,646
[SPEAKER_08]: But perhaps they identified stuff based off of what they heard on there.

575
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:51,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, some of them obviously pretty obvious, like Sandstorm and, you know, stuff like that.

576
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:52,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

577
00:35:53,917 --> 00:36:22,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I opened up a file in a notepad there was some file in there that you could open up a notepad and it shows you a big list and it looked like every single freaking song that's ever been in DDR like it was for either some kind of append or it was like all the four letter edit codes which that's what I thought it was it was all the four letter edit codes because it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that that I know are not going to be in Max that things are not going to be in Max USA but it also had new stuff it had the short long trip in there and it had I Like To Move It it had a remix of Dynamite Rave

578
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:27,197
[SPEAKER_09]: and it had, oh yeah, I'm sorry, I said rave.

579
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, oh yeah, this rave is heavy.

580
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:35,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

581
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:37,749
[SPEAKER_09]: But that wasn't in there.

582
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:38,450
[SPEAKER_09]: That song.

583
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Sandstorm was not in that list, which I thought was interesting.

584
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:42,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

585
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:47,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone at Konami is intentionally messing with us.

586
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's the case.

587
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:52,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So if somebody's saying that list is planted, I think it's BS.

588
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somebody at Konami just got lazy, but I don't think it was a finished version.

589
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:58,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Gee, Konami be lazy on a DDR mix.

590
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:03,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that for demos, it's often made off of the working copy.

591
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:12,562
[SPEAKER_03]: In the USA, hmm... You know, as an example, I had a demo for Umjir Marlami when it was being released in the US and they hadn't finished all their translation.

592
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:31,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can only play, you know, maybe two levels in it, but when I went into the XA files, it had the, um... I don't know how many people played Umjir Marlami, but there was a level that was changed from Japanese to the US, which was she's playing in hell instead of on an island for the Teriyaki Yoko stage, but on that it had the Japanese version for the song lyrics.

593
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,911
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on and so forth.

594
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:55,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I would have to go and believe it.

595
00:37:56,368 --> 00:38:00,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Now some of the things that surprised me on there, well for one is let them move.

596
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that still there?

597
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:06,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but I'm assuming they'll probably take that out.

598
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:10,585
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, here's another thing that we have to understand when we're looking at this list.

599
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if there were all those short samples,

600
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:21,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember back in Extra Mix, there was Petite Love, the short little sample for that, and the banner, and the background stuff, but the song wasn't in there.

601
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:24,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's possible some of this stuff might be cut out.

602
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:37,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true, and didn't somebody else hack USA Mix and actually found that there's backgrounds in USA Mix for Butterfly, Bad Girls, and mostly the stuff that they cut out of Best Hits, although I gotta say...

603
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:42,564
[SPEAKER_09]: The one that was really interesting was Bad Girls because they actually found an image of the background without the gun.

604
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bad Girls wasn't in Best Hits either.

605
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:52,088
[SPEAKER_03]: They also, using a game shark, were able to have it pull up open spots for songs.

606
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:53,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

607
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:58,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's my theory on why there's so many songs listed on this thing.

608
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, especially Let Them Move.

609
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is what made me wonder about this.

610
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:05,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they guaranteed that Let Them Move would not be in this new mix.

611
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:26,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, before they were talking about appending this with Konomics, and if you notice, on the list, which we haven't really kind of revealed the list yet, but, you know, if you've seen it on the sites, it has pretty much, I haven't confirmed this by actually going down the list with Konomics and DDR Max USA, but they're almost identical as far as the old stuff that they have.

612
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:32,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So, my guess would be that you can actually append Konomics with Max USA.

613
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:40,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I don't know if it will allow stuff to be playable, but that would probably be why they have the short samples on there for that.

614
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:48,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to find the list, but we're not going to really read the whole list for you guys, because obviously there's still some tricks to it.

615
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:49,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the final list.

616
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:59,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, we're not going to know until either A, Konami tells us, B, a respectable, reputable gaming site lets us know the information, or C, we have the hot little game in our hands.

617
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll read off.

618
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:09,052
[SPEAKER_09]: What I do want to read off on that list is the new stuff, the new songs that they've discovered, because I'm guessing...

619
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:11,624
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably going to be the most accurate.

620
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:14,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would they have information for new songs if they're not going to be in there after all?

621
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But the old stuff, I'm guessing, is not accurate.

622
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:21,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Things like Ghosts, I have a very hard time believing Ghosts is going to actually be in Max USA.

623
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:22,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.

624
00:40:23,308 --> 00:40:24,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love it if Ghosts made it in Max USA.

625
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:31,812
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of my very favorite DDR songs of all time, but I'm thinking it might be some kind of copy over for Max for Japanese.

626
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:32,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

627
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:33,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the...

628
00:40:52,945 --> 00:41:02,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Stoke Out Kicks sent me the hacked text file, but again, what I'm seeing on this list, it looks like codes for every song that you see, but you see things in here listed in here.

629
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:05,030
[SPEAKER_09]: This is that part of the text file that had all these things.

630
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:15,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You see things that I just don't believe are going to be in Max USA, like Captain Jack Grandio makes Mr. Wonderful, but look, you see these little three-letter codes before each one.

631
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:28,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Like FLAS for Flashdance, AFRO for Afronova I think that might have something to do with some kind of append mode or edit mode, I don't know But, who knows You know what?

632
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:37,618
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Flashdance is not Konami, it's just not Konami original We should take the import version and see if they also have similar things We'll probably, we'll look at that later, but I do want to read these new ones that are showing up in there, because

633
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:39,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll tell you what those things are.

634
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:51,034
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times for writing code, instead of having to write the huge long name out every single time, they'll give it like basically another name for it or shorten it up.

635
00:41:51,414 --> 00:42:00,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So for instance, when you have like, let's see, Together and Forever, they'll shorten it down to T-O-G-E instead of having to write Together and Forever every single time.

636
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes coding a lot smaller.

637
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:03,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what that is.

638
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:08,001
[SPEAKER_09]: So, some new songs we see in here that we haven't seen in DDR yet.

639
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:28,035
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Jam & Marmalade, Logical Dash, Look to the Sky, True Color Mix, Overblast, which has been confirmed, Peace Out, I'm For Real, The Shining Polaris, that's one I'm looking forward to, Drop the Bomb, the System SF mix, which by the way has been sent to me by JB in the chat room, so maybe we'll play that later.

640
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Dynamite R, the Downbird Soda Mix, Take It To The Morning Light, extended vocal version, You Leave Me Alone, Dark Black Forest, Short Trip, Nemesis, cool, Ain't It Good, the original vocal mix, M2 Step, version 1.01, 22 Dunk, 511, Abyss,

641
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:49,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby, Baby, Gimme Your Love, and I Like To Move It.

642
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:54,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's Baby, Baby, yeah, some of those, so I don't know, something's mixed together.

643
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:59,754
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some other ones on there, too, that you didn't mention up at the top there.

644
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:01,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

645
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:07,218
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one of them that's going to be, well, Look To The Sky, True Color Mix is going to be in there.

646
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:11,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one was, let's see, what the hell is that?

647
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:13,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

648
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:13,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Na Ha Ha?

649
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:19,496
[SPEAKER_08]: It's DUM-S-Naha Requiem Mix, whatever the hell that is.

650
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:22,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Orion Civilization, is that a remix?

651
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:23,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

652
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:27,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, it looks like possibly an Orion 78 remix.

653
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:34,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, DarkBlackForce, of course, you mentioned there's a...

654
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:36,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, you mentioned Drop the Bomb.

655
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:40,327
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Do It Right remix, too, that's in there.

656
00:43:40,347 --> 00:43:41,127
[SPEAKER_03]: The Stat Battle Modes.

657
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:42,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the hell is that?

658
00:43:42,508 --> 00:43:44,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep on moving and let them move Stat Battle Modes in.

659
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,529
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we got in there?

660
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:45,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Second mix.

661
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

662
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:52,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think it's just a list of codes.

663
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:56,135
[SPEAKER_09]: The only things I see interesting about this are the new songs.

664
00:43:56,535 --> 00:44:01,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this list shows us, it really shows us what songs are going to be in Max.

665
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some kind of...

666
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:04,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's in here that says, do it right, harmonize, step next.

667
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:19,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel the beat Feel the beat's not listed either So we know it's missing something

668
00:44:44,702 --> 00:44:46,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's got to be a work in process.

669
00:44:49,308 --> 00:44:56,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So... But it is pretty interesting and it does open up a lot of possibilities for things we might see.

670
00:44:57,098 --> 00:44:57,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, cool.

671
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,821
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do you want to talk about, Max?

672
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I played the demo.

673
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:05,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about being a measure off, shall we?

674
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:07,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, what happened?

675
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:10,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Why look to the sky and let the bee hit him a measure off?

676
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's even a trick, they were too.

677
00:45:13,353 --> 00:45:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor is that somehow an old version of the demo got put on the demo disc.

678
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:25,863
[SPEAKER_09]: That they actually released a fix to the PlayStation Magazine people, but they put the wrong one on there.

679
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:27,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be getting it later too.

680
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:29,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it seems kind of...

681
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:32,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

682
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Secret Rendezvous, what am I saying?

683
00:45:59,295 --> 00:45:59,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

684
00:45:59,996 --> 00:46:02,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, other than the fact that I don't like playing Secret Rendezvous.

685
00:46:04,338 --> 00:46:09,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's another one that I found pretty interesting, and I'm all... Damn it, I gotta say the damn name.

686
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:15,446
[SPEAKER_08]: It's R. Okay, Dynamite R3 Down Bird Sota Mix.

687
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:23,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm... Let's start going on... Either way, we're effed, because we're getting a Dynamite R remix.

688
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:23,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Reap!

689
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:23,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

690
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:24,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

691
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:24,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

692
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:24,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

693
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

694
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:25,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Reap!

695
00:46:36,954 --> 00:46:41,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We might, maybe we'll get to hear it at some point, I don't know You guys want to hear the Drop the Bomb mix that I got?

696
00:46:42,396 --> 00:47:03,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should go ahead and play it We're going to play it, we'll play the Drop the Bomb mix And then we're going to talk a little bit about We'll talk about 8th Style or something We're not going to go into full break, I'm just going to play this one song I've got the Drop the Bomb mix, I'm going to play it for you guys Oh, it's just the clip, I thought it was a full song Ah, shit, alright, well then We get to hear the clip, alright, here we go

697
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

698
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,081
[SPEAKER_09]: That is pretty cool.

699
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

700
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:21,804
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all going, it's going trancy.

701
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:23,205
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what Max is going to be?

702
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,588
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Max is going to be one giant rave.

703
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:29,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

704
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:32,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I'm going to, okay.

705
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:40,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been wishing, I mean, I kind of like Dynamite R3, but I've been hoping that they do a trance remix of that.

706
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:46,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Please be a trance remix and not some goddamn awful speed mix or bass mix.

707
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Trance remix.

708
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:49,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want.

709
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we need more booty music in DDR.

710
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:51,944
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't enough.

711
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see some solo bass stuff.

712
00:47:54,826 --> 00:47:57,887
[SPEAKER_03]: The booty music in... I want my baby mama.

713
00:47:58,407 --> 00:47:58,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

714
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to... You know, there would be trouble for that, though, because... Well, I don't know.

715
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:03,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably bubble domain by now.

716
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

717
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Who that is?

718
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:08,451
[SPEAKER_09]: My baby mama.

719
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:10,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that'll be next.

720
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:14,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week, every time somebody says the word booty, we'll get into playing My Baby Mama.

721
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:14,656
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun.

722
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:21,245
[SPEAKER_09]: At least we're not screaming like they're doing on... You know, it just makes me a little bit upset about my old dead computer, the fact that I had the XA player and the XA to MP3 converter too.

723
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:24,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I would need to get all that stuff again, and then I could make them myself.

724
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:46,524
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you all, listeners, for giving us the stuff.

725
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:49,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, Loki.

726
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:50,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to break?

727
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:52,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's break stuff.

728
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:55,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I be doing my little intro to this song here?

729
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about 8th Style.

730
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,551
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll talk more about 8th Style for the break.

731
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: 8th Style.

732
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:03,734
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's talk about 2DX 8th Style.

733
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,895
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got one new song's been revealed.

734
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, two new songs have been revealed.

735
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:14,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are the super secret hidden tracks, which apparently... I don't know if this is 100%... You have to meet DJ Lisu to get them.

736
00:49:14,943 --> 00:49:18,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you have to basically kick the crap out of Agapa and Lisu.

737
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:18,186
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

738
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:19,086
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to...

739
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:23,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Triple A, a Flashing 7 song on hard.

740
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get to play a song called Sakura.

741
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:27,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't that make you happy?

742
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:28,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never get to play that, Donald.

743
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:29,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie.

744
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:31,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get that.

745
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:37,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you can Triple A that, if you can Triple A Sakura, you get a Mr. T song called Xeno on.

746
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you have to be DJ Lisu.

747
00:49:39,782 --> 00:49:41,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to play those songs for you right now.

748
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:46,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But Loki has a very interesting theory about Sakura, which is a song by Revenge.

749
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:47,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

750
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:48,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Now...

751
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:52,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I found this link the other day, you know, to find this song.

752
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:57,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I listened to it, and I was like, oh my god, this is Max Unlimited.

753
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,751
[SPEAKER_08]: This song is a remix of Max Unlimited.

754
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:04,234
[SPEAKER_08]: No one is saying it is, except for me, but it's a goddamn remix of Max Unlimited.

755
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:08,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the same bassline as Max Unlimited, almost identical to Max Unlimited.

756
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you listen to the key sounds of it, it has the exact same bass line.

757
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to Max Enigma to get what I'm saying, because that's all he has playing in the background is the bass line.

758
00:50:19,002 --> 00:50:24,345
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the exact same bass line, plus it's actually got a spot where they could put freezes.

759
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:30,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what's interesting is, remember when they were talking about Max to the XXXM, and how they said there's going to be two freezes in it?

760
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:33,469
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two spots in this song that could put freezes for it.

761
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:42,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, another thing is there's a part where it speeds up and you'll actually hear the drum that's in the background of Max Unlimited and also the bassline too.

762
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:47,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the very end of the song, there's a spot where it goes that dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, you know, that type of thing.

763
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:47,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

764
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got that there.

765
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:54,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, don't be thrown off by the fact that it's got that twangy shit from, you know, Cigaru and all that stuff.

766
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:55,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just typical revenge blabber.

767
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:58,715
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, it's not twangy shit.

768
00:50:58,875 --> 00:50:59,776
[SPEAKER_03]: It's traditional...

769
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

770
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:15,535
[SPEAKER_08]: All this fucking internet rumor shit is really pissing me off.

771
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:21,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So some dumbass Japanese guy over there comes up, Oh, this sounds like a good name for the next Max.

772
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And then puts it out there.

773
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Some idiot copies that list, and then more idiots copy that list, and then people start taking that for fact.

774
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:28,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we copy it.

775
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:30,064
[SPEAKER_09]: You hear it here first on Orange Launch.

776
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:30,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

777
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:31,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I never said that that was a song.

778
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:33,346
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the dumbest name ever.

779
00:51:33,806 --> 00:51:36,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Sakura, okay, I am going to put my money on this song.

780
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:39,550
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be the next Max song.

781
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:42,913
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Kanami would like to welcome you to the internet, Loki.

782
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,414
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to the rumors.

783
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:06,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakura is a Japanese folk song with the Max bassline.

784
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it for my fiance, Dan, the other night, and he even mentioned that he heard it in another game that had a level that had traditional music playing in the background.

785
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:37,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, coming to think of it, I do remember hearing it before, so that's why I'm personally a little bit iffy about that theory.

786
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:43,007
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I wouldn't put it beyond them to make that a bonus.

787
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how much money are you putting on this, Loki?

788
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:49,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I didn't say anything about money.

789
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,955
[SPEAKER_09]: You said you're putting your money on this, that Sakura's going to be the hidden song.

790
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:55,438
[SPEAKER_09]: My credibility, how about that?

791
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:56,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Your dignity?

792
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:57,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, dignity.

793
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's another thing.

794
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:00,662
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 150 beats per minute.

795
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:03,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, double that, and what have we got?

796
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:03,724
300!

797
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:07,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, didn't see that one coming.

798
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:09,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

799
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need any more clues that this is going to be the next Max song?

800
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:18,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, or if it's not, then they did a really shitty-ass job with creating a new song.

801
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, let's just take the bass line from this one and throw some other stuff on top of it.

802
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:23,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, new song.

803
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:23,843
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

804
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I say let's just play it.

805
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:32,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, uh, we... First off, we did get that clip of Dynamite Ray we were talking about earlier.

806
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:33,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh!

807
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh!

808
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit, I said the word, didn't I?

809
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:35,731
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

810
00:53:36,192 --> 00:53:36,672
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

811
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:41,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

812
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh!

813
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:44,237
[SPEAKER_07]: This tastes like aspirin.

814
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:50,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We got this clip of the Dynamite R song.

815
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:54,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'm being told, though, that it's kind of messed up and kind of scratchy and it's going to mess up.

816
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:58,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't screened this yet, so we're just going to play it live on air for the first time.

817
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:02,383
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be effed up, but it's only 15 seconds, so deal with it, okay?

818
00:54:02,423 --> 00:54:02,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

819
00:54:17,947 --> 00:54:18,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sounds like Naoki to me.

820
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Double your pleasure, double your fun.

821
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:22,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck twins.

822
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:30,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I don't, don't wanna, wanna give, give up, up, throw, throw up, up, rave.

823
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:34,853
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Dynamite, Dynamite Rave Stutter Mix.

824
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, enough of that.

825
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:46,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, minus the fact that it was double your pleasure, double your fun time, it sounded a little bit trancy, and you might be getting your wish.

826
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,654
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little fat, more like a KOG man.

827
00:54:48,674 --> 00:54:52,135
[SPEAKER_09]: No, all they need to do... It sounded like frickin' Eurobeat.

828
00:54:52,376 --> 00:55:00,158
[SPEAKER_03]: All they need to do is just slow it down, you know like when you're listening to the song in 2DX and you put it in training mode and slow it down all the way?

829
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:03,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a Ska song, they should do Dynamite or Ska.

830
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:07,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna give up...

831
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get to those songs from 8th style.

832
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:16,600
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start this off with Sakura, and then we're going to get to the special, super special stage, Mr. T with Xenoine.

833
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:22,823
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, we're going to completely change gears, and we're going to hear a Gak song, because Jamie demands it.

834
00:55:23,043 --> 00:55:23,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good to me.

835
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:28,566
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gak song is, by the way, the one that made it into Guitar Freak's 8th mix.

836
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:30,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Another World.

837
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:31,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

838
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay kids, you can send me your FUs of the week over messages in the chat room.

839
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to those in the next bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

840
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:23,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

841
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:19,289
Thanks for watching!

842
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:15,208
[SPEAKER_01]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

843
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:19,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

844
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:27,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.

845
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby, I've got you baby.

846
00:59:51,377 --> 00:59:52,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

847
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:24,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yume Nara Samenai De Kono Sora No Mukou E You Can't See Another World

848
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:34,834
[SPEAKER_04]: The roadside is full of hurtful souls.

849
01:00:34,854 --> 01:00:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The broken taxi, you are beautiful.

850
01:00:36,315 --> 01:00:37,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We exchange words and we cry together.

851
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:39,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Gently embraced by the pain of love.

852
01:00:55,878 --> 01:00:56,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

853
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:41,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Tatoe donna ni kizutsu ite mo Ani ga soba ni ita kara Dare yori wa tooku e Yume nara samenaide

854
01:02:01,045 --> 01:02:01,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

855
01:02:48,488 --> 01:02:56,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Hiho, Kermit the VOG here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

856
01:02:56,911 --> 01:03:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

857
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just going to go up the street, and you're going to make a right at the Shell Station, and you're going to... Watch out for the drop-off.

858
01:03:10,014 --> 01:03:12,295
[SPEAKER_09]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

859
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:15,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey you, you five-year-old, you give me your lunch money.

860
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,143
[SPEAKER_19]: I got you!

861
01:03:24,828 --> 01:03:27,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We taking Jamie on down to Sesame Street.

862
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:31,813
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no more.

863
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:32,714
[SPEAKER_02]: No more.

864
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it, he said it.

865
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't get picked up on microphone.

866
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:35,956
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't play it.

867
01:03:36,517 --> 01:03:38,138
[SPEAKER_09]: If it didn't get picked up on microphone, we can't...

868
01:03:44,812 --> 01:03:50,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what I'm learning how to do though?

869
01:03:51,015 --> 01:03:55,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm learning how to hit the buttons right on the keyboard so I can bring up that raise thing right away.

870
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

871
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:06,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chatroom cries every time we do that, by the way.

872
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:07,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We love you guys.

873
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:14,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chatroom just gets, you know, every time that somebody says the R word, the chatroom just gets completely out of hand.

874
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:17,411
[SPEAKER_09]: They just all at once, they just start getting into it.

875
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:19,472
[SPEAKER_09]: They just start, you know, yelling out in the chatroom.

876
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:23,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They just all start crying.

877
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:24,496
[SPEAKER_09]: They all start crying.

878
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:27,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I said it.

879
01:04:28,779 --> 01:04:28,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

880
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,280
[SPEAKER_02]: You bitch.

881
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:33,564
[SPEAKER_09]: This is never gonna get old.

882
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:34,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.

883
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:57,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

884
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:02,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week's show for October the 13th.

885
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:03,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, lucky day there.

886
01:05:04,137 --> 01:05:06,098
[SPEAKER_09]: October the 13th show will be pre-taped.

887
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not going to be doing it live here in studio.

888
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't come to the house next Sunday because we won't be here.

889
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:13,562
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to pre-tape.

890
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:17,443
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to pre-tape, I don't know where.

891
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:18,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing Scandia?

892
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:19,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Scandia.

893
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Thursday night, I think?

894
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:22,919
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

895
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:48,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you want to be a special guest, show up.

896
01:05:48,955 --> 01:05:49,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And give me a dollar!

897
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:50,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed.

898
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:14,062
[SPEAKER_18]: and now I write to you with open eyes I put that song on repeat the other night

899
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:37,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, for people who actually read my live journal, I'm going to have to have that as my live journal song for the night.

900
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:39,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good deal.

901
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:44,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll have to do our own little guilty pleasure set soon, some week.

902
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:47,730
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have to do our DDR 2DX guilty pleasures.

903
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, right now I'm commissioning somebody.

904
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:52,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Make me this remix.

905
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:57,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Make me Dynamite thingy mixed with R5.

906
01:07:00,501 --> 01:07:01,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It would sound good.

907
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:02,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Dynamite R5.

908
01:07:03,664 --> 01:07:04,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynamite R5.

909
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:09,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So would that be... Yeah, okay.

910
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Thursday is going to be all about Retro Edit Day.

911
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:16,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to bring back all the old Fourth Mix edits that I had.

912
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:17,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

913
01:07:18,457 --> 01:07:19,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Retro Edit Day, hell yeah.

914
01:07:20,518 --> 01:07:24,060
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could come, but I probably can't, because it's school.

915
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:24,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

916
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:32,603
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I would totally play all the edits that are already pre-loaded onto the fourth mix machine, like the B4U edit that totally rules.

917
01:07:33,423 --> 01:07:34,824
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are some other ones, too, I forget.

918
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:38,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about the edits that are in my pocket.

919
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:42,467
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the Stomp to My Beat S-Maniac stuff in there.

920
01:07:43,568 --> 01:07:44,028
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

921
01:07:46,644 --> 01:07:52,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So, live on Thursday, when we tape at Scandia, I'm going to see if I can make this happen, if I can get a video camera by then.

922
01:07:52,790 --> 01:08:05,821
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you that were listening last week, you heard us bitching and bitching and bitching about these ignorant ignoramuses at TwinGalaxies.com, who do the world record.

923
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,052
[SPEAKER_09]: No more references to USL.

924
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:13,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not allowed to talk about this show on that show.

925
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:15,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to limit it.

926
01:08:15,735 --> 01:08:18,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to quote a... Never mind.

927
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:19,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis, you're listening.

928
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:20,298
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you're cool.

929
01:08:21,419 --> 01:08:24,001
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're an asshole for not letting me talk about DDR on that show.

930
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:28,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, he talked about Orange Lounge yesterday.

931
01:08:28,877 --> 01:08:30,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he made fun of it.

932
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:32,739
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's still airtime.

933
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,239
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still promo.

934
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do that live.

935
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be rebroadcast next Sunday.

936
01:08:38,921 --> 01:08:42,482
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can get the video camera in time, we will do that over there live.

937
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:48,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope Black Lab can get over there Thursday because I know he's probably going to get the best score out of any of us that I know of that would show up.

938
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to do the traveling road show too.

939
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:55,247
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do one from Tapioca Express in Davis.

940
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:55,967
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find that.

941
01:08:56,468 --> 01:08:57,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Bulba and Orange Lounge.

942
01:08:57,768 --> 01:09:02,790
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find that bowling alley movie theater in Auburn that has the second mix.

943
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:03,851
[SPEAKER_08]: How would that be?

944
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:08,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this record was shattered in a tapioca express.

945
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:10,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be winner.

946
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:13,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

947
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:17,490
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be just like saying, you know, this record was shattered by a paraplegic.

948
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:20,792
[SPEAKER_19]: I shattered this record while eating squid.

949
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:25,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the record was also said by like some total moron anyway who made up his own rules.

950
01:09:26,156 --> 01:09:27,797
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, okay, here are the rules.

951
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:28,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I win.

952
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still thinking we need to critique the rules and send them in and to point out each and every reason why they're wrong and why they're idiots.

953
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:35,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Rule number seven, I can only win.

954
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:36,542
[SPEAKER_08]: No one else can win.

955
01:09:36,722 --> 01:09:37,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Just me.

956
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:38,604
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I'm cute.

957
01:09:40,185 --> 01:09:40,585
[SPEAKER_08]: He's ugly.

958
01:09:42,116 --> 01:09:45,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Chatroom is getting their panties in a bunch because we haven't done the FUs yet.

959
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're going to do the FUs right now.

960
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:49,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jamie!

961
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to let that little thing do the talking for you.

962
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:56,529
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who else likes that thing?

963
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy's two-year-old daughter likes that.

964
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:03,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember having a particular somebody over here humping it.

965
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:04,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, what?

966
01:10:06,178 --> 01:10:06,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

967
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:08,620
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd Dave do?

968
01:10:11,502 --> 01:10:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you are foul tonight.

969
01:10:13,324 --> 01:10:14,005
[SPEAKER_09]: You're foul.

970
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:14,766
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gross.

971
01:10:14,926 --> 01:10:15,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

972
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:16,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Chili, I'm telling you.

973
01:10:16,368 --> 01:10:17,850
[SPEAKER_10]: The chili in those cheese things.

974
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:19,672
Yeah.

975
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:19,872
I know.

976
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:21,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I can smell it.

977
01:10:22,115 --> 01:10:23,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, do you have any FUs of the week?

978
01:10:24,017 --> 01:10:24,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I do.

979
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I think of them.

980
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:30,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have my secret FU, which none of you are going to know about.

981
01:10:34,377 --> 01:10:39,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, I know, I know the secret FU, I know it, I know it, I'm not telling.

982
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:43,326
[SPEAKER_03]: For anybody who wants to know what my secret FU is, you know, try to find me online.

983
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Try.

984
01:10:47,793 --> 01:10:48,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Found you.

985
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:52,414
[SPEAKER_16]: You on Orange Lounge every Sunday night, bitch.

986
01:10:52,494 --> 01:10:54,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I just forgot.

987
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:59,356
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my other FDs that I have, one of them goes toward Voltage.

988
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:00,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

989
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw me play that song.

990
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:02,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

991
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:04,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw how damn close I was to that song.

992
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:06,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in 78.

993
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:13,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another one that... Dude, I said what my FDs were at the beginning of the show.

994
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:14,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, I can't remember.

995
01:11:15,183 --> 01:11:18,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, my other fuck you goes toward, well, it's a kind of, sort of one.

996
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a job, and I liked being unemployed.

997
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:24,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked living off of my unemployment.

998
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray for welfare!

999
01:11:26,651 --> 01:11:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't on welfare, I was on unemployment, it's different.

1000
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not, you know, pooping out babies just to get another fuck, okay?

1001
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:37,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, locking them up in the closet, feeding them, you know...

1002
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:45,435
[SPEAKER_09]: The funny thing is, if you ever did have a kid, you would fight with them over who gets to play Nintendo.

1003
01:11:45,455 --> 01:11:46,076
[SPEAKER_09]: You really would.

1004
01:11:46,656 --> 01:11:47,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them, that's mine.

1005
01:11:47,756 --> 01:11:48,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I fight for myself.

1006
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:51,036
[SPEAKER_03]: They want theirs, they can earn their money and fight themselves.

1007
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:51,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1008
01:11:51,977 --> 01:12:00,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but you know, my job keeps me so busy and I have hardly any time, so I'm like this zombie during the week, and I came in the zombie today.

1009
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:03,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I found, though, I do have a happy thing.

1010
01:12:03,339 --> 01:12:04,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I need happy music.

1011
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:05,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Thing?

1012
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Music, Happy Music, Happy Music.

1013
01:12:12,072 --> 01:12:13,853
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I got Happy Music, I'm just looking for it.

1014
01:12:15,574 --> 01:12:18,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on, I'm looking, I'm looking.

1015
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:23,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the perfect song if I can find it.

1016
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:25,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it.

1017
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:27,660
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a happy song.

1018
01:12:30,362 --> 01:12:30,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1019
01:12:31,524 --> 01:12:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my happy thing is I've discovered a wonderful drink, get a drink to make it work.

1020
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:37,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me hyper.

1021
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Take the Coffee.

1022
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:50,410
[SPEAKER_03]: When the coffee has been brewed and people have poured and there's about half of the container of coffee left, you pour yourself a cup and add in a pack of hot chocolate.

1023
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:54,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You add in hazelnut creamer and then some sugar.

1024
01:12:54,754 --> 01:12:57,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Mix it up and add more coffee and that's instant go-go juice.

1025
01:12:58,196 --> 01:13:00,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes you hyper for at least two hours.

1026
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:02,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Top that with penguin mints to get rid of the bad breath.

1027
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I get my work done fast.

1028
01:13:08,308 --> 01:13:08,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

1029
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other FUs or BlessUs or whatever we're calling them?

1030
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:18,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, other than my secret FU, which, because I'm not going to be in as much of a bitch as I was earlier.

1031
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.

1032
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, fuck that, you know.

1033
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck Twin Galaxies.

1034
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, conjoined Twin Galaxies.

1035
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:27,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, fair enough.

1036
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:28,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So fuck them.

1037
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them right in their nostril, because they're ass-ache good enough.

1038
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, their ass ain't good enough.

1039
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:39,667
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we pass the mic on to... I'm going to, no, it's my turn.

1040
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:41,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fine.

1041
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:42,149
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU's of the week.

1042
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:54,023
[SPEAKER_09]: My own job, who has moved me to a new cube that's half the size of my old one, right in the middle of Fast Lane where everybody walks through, so I can't really exactly get on the internet.

1043
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:56,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have to take phone calls?

1044
01:13:56,324 --> 01:13:59,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're supposed to, but we don't have to if we don't take the call and roll it over to someone else.

1045
01:14:24,018 --> 01:14:24,318
[SPEAKER_08]: F-Drama

1046
01:14:51,463 --> 01:14:53,244
[SPEAKER_09]: F-Drama, my life is not passions.

1047
01:14:54,045 --> 01:14:55,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not living in passions land.

1048
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you make my life feel like passions?

1049
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:01,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see.

1050
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: As promised from last week, I said I would have an FU this week.

1051
01:15:06,213 --> 01:15:07,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, yes, you have an FU.

1052
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:09,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Now...

1053
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:21,654
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I'd like to learn how to program my remote control and what to do if there's static on my screen and that kind of stuff, I don't like the fact that Dish Network took away all my channels.

1054
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:27,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I returned on TV this morning and all the channels were locked out because they said that they did not receive payment from us.

1055
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:30,194
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we had already paid them.

1056
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:30,775
[SPEAKER_08]: They suck.

1057
01:15:30,855 --> 01:15:37,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to use the Dish Network because they suck and I don't care how to program my fucking remote and what the hell it can do.

1058
01:15:38,061 --> 01:15:45,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, if there was static on the screen, I wouldn't know how to get rid of it because I wouldn't be able to see this stupid broadcast about how to get rid of static.

1059
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:47,869
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I hate Dish Network.

1060
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:50,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Although that one chick that's in their commercials has a nice rack.

1061
01:15:52,116 --> 01:15:53,838
[SPEAKER_08]: She has a nice rack.

1062
01:15:53,858 --> 01:15:54,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice, nice rack.

1063
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,400
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard it here first.

1064
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,844
[SPEAKER_08]: The Chicken and the Dish Network commercial has a nice rack.

1065
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:01,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And now today.

1066
01:16:02,146 --> 01:16:02,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1067
01:16:02,866 --> 01:16:05,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I only have a couple of FUs.

1068
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:07,251
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the same song because I'm lazy.

1069
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

1070
01:16:08,072 --> 01:16:08,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want the same song.

1071
01:16:08,972 --> 01:16:09,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1072
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:10,794
[SPEAKER_10]: My FUs go to 3DX songs that I can't pass.

1073
01:16:15,262 --> 01:16:20,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Mainly, Bari, this is a shitty ass song and I hate the crap out of it.

1074
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And Love is Dreaminess in G2.

1075
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:30,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Love is Dreaminess on 7 star, or 7G and, uh, and the other two on my 7.

1076
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't pass them.

1077
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:32,811
[SPEAKER_10]: They are hard.

1078
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:34,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Very hard.

1079
01:16:36,253 --> 01:16:36,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1080
01:16:39,935 --> 01:16:40,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1081
01:16:40,755 --> 01:16:41,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're gonna do, uh,

1082
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have our request and dedication.

1083
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:48,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad we don't have Casey Kasem here to do it for us.

1084
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:59,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I dedicated the dead airspace on the show to Twin, but I feel kind of bad a little bit, so we're going to dedicate this one song to you.

1085
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel special?

1086
01:17:03,441 --> 01:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel loved?

1087
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:04,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1088
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:13,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1089
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we get back to the FUs now?

1090
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:17,982
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1091
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:21,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Say it!

1092
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:22,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Say it!

1093
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:23,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Say it!

1094
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:25,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say the word.

1095
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:30,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bad four-letter word, okay?

1096
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:35,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the four-letter R word.

1097
01:17:35,365 --> 01:17:37,046
[SPEAKER_10]: What four-letter R words are there?

1098
01:17:38,106 --> 01:17:38,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Rave!

1099
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew it was coming.

1100
01:17:47,782 --> 01:17:53,624
[SPEAKER_10]: See, it's just funny because every time someone says that, Rob throws his hands up in the air.

1101
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:55,644
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not being a face, it's on a Friday night.

1102
01:17:55,844 --> 01:17:56,444
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so funny.

1103
01:17:56,864 --> 01:17:58,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob starts doing the club hoochie dance.

1104
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:02,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's a good thing he's not standing up.

1105
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I do the I want to get some tonight dance.

1106
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:09,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to go to the chat room FUs now.

1107
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:16,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, some people just wrote some fucking novels tonight, so I'm going to be quick.

1108
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:17,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Lab.

1109
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:22,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Black Lab's cool, so I'll let him have all the FUs he wants, because he's whoring out our station.

1110
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:23,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So, excuse me, excuse me, boys.

1111
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I do an FU here?

1112
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1113
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:28,062
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to share with the rest of the network here?

1114
01:18:28,082 --> 01:18:29,203
[SPEAKER_18]: You have enough for everybody!

1115
01:18:29,763 --> 01:18:30,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1116
01:18:30,864 --> 01:18:40,710
[SPEAKER_10]: But yesterday at Pat's party, which was awesome, Loki brought... He's got the massive sim, DDR, DX, or whatever, and...

1117
01:18:41,878 --> 01:18:54,653
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the songs is by this one guy, and he basically layered his voice over and over, making all the different noises to songs like ZXY and V. We're going to get to those.

1118
01:18:54,673 --> 01:18:55,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, later.

1119
01:18:55,935 --> 01:18:56,876
[SPEAKER_10]: So, wait.

1120
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:58,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have two microphones.

1121
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:00,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Be scared.

1122
01:19:02,162 --> 01:19:04,205
[SPEAKER_02]: and Jimmy, my microphone.

1123
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:05,407
[SPEAKER_02]: He's rapping.

1124
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:07,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the FUs now, please.

1125
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1126
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:09,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1127
01:19:09,893 --> 01:19:13,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Lab, our buddy, our pal, says, Fuck the Yankees.

1128
01:19:13,538 --> 01:19:14,359
[SPEAKER_09]: They deserve to lose.

1129
01:19:15,094 --> 01:19:17,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the Twins for beating the A's, dammit.

1130
01:19:17,675 --> 01:19:21,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck my allergies for knocking me out on Monday, I missed two classes because of it.

1131
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:27,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the University Dining Commons for closing their dinner times at 7pm and locking the doors five minutes before 7pm.

1132
01:19:28,259 --> 01:19:35,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck my bike for getting a flat tire as I left my last class on Friday, thus forcing me to walk it a half an hour across campus back to my dorm.

1133
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:40,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck IRCLE and my IRC client for being so goddamn hard to crack, although it did get done.

1134
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:44,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the T1 line in the dorms for being so overcrowded.

1135
01:19:44,164 --> 01:19:45,724
[SPEAKER_09]: 250 or so people share it.

1136
01:19:46,725 --> 01:19:49,625
[SPEAKER_09]: And so slow that I can't get more than 5k a second on downloads.

1137
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the local ride aid for closing at 8pm.

1138
01:19:52,466 --> 01:19:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't get my bike parts when I needed them.

1139
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:58,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the UC Housing Commission for not letting me bring my car up because of parking issues.

1140
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:01,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have been at the show tonight to give you the rest of these FUs in person if I had my car.

1141
01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:06,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And number 10... Fuck raving.

1142
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Lab, you brought that on yourself.

1143
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:21,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get number 10 from him, unfortunately, so I don't know what happened, but that was number 11, so I guess I missed one.

1144
01:20:21,302 --> 01:20:22,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure he'll send it to me.

1145
01:20:24,884 --> 01:20:26,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Twins got a few.

1146
01:20:26,764 --> 01:20:28,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if I can run through these here.

1147
01:20:28,085 --> 01:20:28,105
[SPEAKER_09]: F...

1148
01:20:30,362 --> 01:20:37,167
[SPEAKER_09]: FU Arcade owner's daughter's boyfriend bitching at me because he thinks I broke the Percussion Freaks machine we just got on Friday.

1149
01:20:37,487 --> 01:20:40,389
[SPEAKER_09]: He does say thank you for Percussion Freaks 4th and PPB 1st.

1150
01:20:40,429 --> 01:20:41,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray for Korean knockoffs.

1151
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:46,974
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to AOLIM for cutting me off every five minutes on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings.

1152
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:52,018
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to his attitude in the channel earlier this week.

1153
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:55,065
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to stuff.

1154
01:20:56,366 --> 01:20:59,769
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to OthersideIRC.net for being down this weekend.

1155
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, F champs.

1156
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:02,172
[SPEAKER_09]: F Nick Servant champs.

1157
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,253
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been gone all weekend.

1158
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:03,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck that.

1159
01:21:03,873 --> 01:21:04,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1160
01:21:05,555 --> 01:21:09,679
[SPEAKER_09]: F waiting until the beta Fate of Fury comes out because that got delayed until the 15th, I think.

1161
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,202
[SPEAKER_09]: F waiting until Max USA comes out.

1162
01:21:12,362 --> 01:21:13,343
[SPEAKER_09]: F waiting until FU is.

1163
01:21:13,363 --> 01:21:13,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, jeez.

1164
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:18,208
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just full of fucking fucks tonight.

1165
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:19,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck waiting.

1166
01:21:19,589 --> 01:21:23,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did we get number 10?

1167
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:24,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fuck yeah.

1168
01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:25,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Lab's number 10.

1169
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:29,357
[SPEAKER_09]: SoCalKicks says he's had a pretty crappy week.

1170
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: He was supposed to not be here tonight.

1171
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:35,502
[SPEAKER_09]: He was going to go out and hang with some friends, but here he is in the chat room sending his FUs.

1172
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:43,469
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, fuck you, Jason, who didn't drive me to Boomers to see Mike, who I haven't seen in over a month, and who I really, really wanted to see, and fuck you, Sky, for threatening to cut me.

1173
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:48,160
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a long story there that I'm not going to tell on the air.

1174
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did threaten to cut SoCalKicks earlier.

1175
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:51,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to cut him.

1176
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:52,082
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going to cut you.

1177
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:55,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, do you have any more?

1178
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:56,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1179
01:21:57,925 --> 01:22:01,887
[SPEAKER_09]: JB says, Fuck you to anyone who hates Jenny Rom.

1180
01:22:01,907 --> 01:22:03,668
[SPEAKER_09]: They can all suffer massive quantities of pain.

1181
01:22:05,089 --> 01:22:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And fuck you to himself for almost failing freshman seminar with a D. Uh-oh.

1182
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:12,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You are my friend.

1183
01:22:14,223 --> 01:22:17,706
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus says, Shine Get, and FU to Shingle Springs.

1184
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,807
[SPEAKER_09]: They stole my girlfriend.

1185
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Two words, suicide watch.

1186
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:21,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's kind of harsh.

1187
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:22,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sorry to hear that.

1188
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:23,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1189
01:22:26,552 --> 01:22:31,976
[SPEAKER_09]: MoreThanJay says, FU to all the people who asked to use my health baby, egg baby, as a football.

1190
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:32,856
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't abuse it.

1191
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:33,637
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my job.

1192
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:38,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, they should give them Tamagotchi as their egg baby.

1193
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's, you know, you should use one of those.

1194
01:22:43,677 --> 01:22:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any more?

1195
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:44,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1196
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:49,464
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Konami wants to give an F you to... That's what he says.

1197
01:22:49,644 --> 01:22:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1198
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:52,328
[SPEAKER_18]: He can't throw up.

1199
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:56,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joe Mama says F you to his computer for being shitty after Microsoft made me update.

1200
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,860
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you never download the Microsoft update.

1201
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask Microsoft for getting into Liksang's business and shutting them down.

1202
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:06,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fuck a bunch of them.

1203
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more angry music.

1204
01:23:07,425 --> 01:23:08,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the Xbox.

1205
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:09,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more angry music.

1206
01:23:09,306 --> 01:23:10,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not need love music.

1207
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:10,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1208
01:23:11,328 --> 01:23:13,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Bigger console meets better console, correct?

1209
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:19,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, fuck Microsoft.

1210
01:23:20,755 --> 01:23:22,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the, what, RIA?

1211
01:23:22,517 --> 01:23:24,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Jamie's going to have to buy all her stuff from BuyRite.

1212
01:23:26,176 --> 01:23:27,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell no!

1213
01:23:28,038 --> 01:23:31,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie does not buy from Byright, because they are stupid fucks.

1214
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:42,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have you know that I bought my original DDR Max, Japanese version, the one I eventually sold off later on, but I've originally bought them, bought that from Byright, and I had no problems whatsoever.

1215
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,173
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, this is what Byright does.

1216
01:23:45,193 --> 01:23:53,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I know, we know about the whole Tekken thing, so... Fuck Byright, fuck them right in one of their pores, because none of their other orifices are good enough.

1217
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I want it painful.

1218
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:12,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what, I do have to say, I did buy my copy of Dracula X, Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known in the United States as Symphony of the Night, but I bought the Saturn version there for $23 when it was brand new, and now it goes for over $100 on eBay.

1219
01:24:12,651 --> 01:24:12,631
$23?

1220
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:15,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll buy that for a dollar.

1221
01:24:15,612 --> 01:24:19,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, last chat room FUs, these are the last ones, this segment's going on way too long.

1222
01:24:19,913 --> 01:24:24,074
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus says, uh, Shine Lose.

1223
01:24:25,453 --> 01:24:26,574
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sorry, Vegas.

1224
01:24:26,614 --> 01:24:29,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a big hug from Jamie and I. Big hug.

1225
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:34,959
[SPEAKER_09]: MoreThanJay says, Fuck Microshaft for putting down that Linux project.

1226
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:36,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Linux.

1227
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Linux.

1228
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:37,400
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1229
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I still like what my friend calls them.

1230
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:41,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them, you know, Microshaft.

1231
01:24:42,323 --> 01:24:43,704
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend calls them Microflashers.

1232
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:50,388
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, I think... Go to dictionary.com if you don't know what it means.

1233
01:24:51,718 --> 01:24:53,960
[SPEAKER_09]: On that note, I do believe we're going to take another break.

1234
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:56,202
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I want to play this break?

1235
01:24:56,242 --> 01:24:59,244
[SPEAKER_09]: This break, I want to play some Vincent Demore because I think he's awesome.

1236
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a new version of Flotation from his Greatest Hits Disc 1 and a big muah, muah, muah, hugs and kisses to Tal for sending this to me.

1237
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:08,171
[SPEAKER_09]: He rules.

1238
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:09,892
[SPEAKER_09]: He sent me some Vincent Damore albums this week.

1239
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:11,032
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to play this.

1240
01:25:11,052 --> 01:25:12,573
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a new version of Floatation.

1241
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:13,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, it's not really new.

1242
01:25:13,893 --> 01:25:14,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just from his album.

1243
01:25:14,653 --> 01:25:15,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's new to me.

1244
01:25:15,394 --> 01:25:16,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's new to Orange Lounge.

1245
01:25:16,594 --> 01:25:18,075
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a Floatation radio mix.

1246
01:25:18,595 --> 01:25:19,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll play something else.

1247
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe something from 8-Style.

1248
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:21,636
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Love is Orange?

1249
01:25:21,836 --> 01:25:22,676
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll play some Love is Orange.

1250
01:25:22,896 --> 01:25:23,717
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll play Love is Orange.

1251
01:25:23,817 --> 01:25:25,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And play that one song that I like.

1252
01:25:25,297 --> 01:25:25,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll come back.

1253
01:25:26,277 --> 01:25:26,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are we going to do?

1254
01:25:26,998 --> 01:25:27,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to do Listless?

1255
01:25:28,777 --> 01:25:29,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1256
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:29,978
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do a list list.

1257
01:25:29,998 --> 01:25:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do a list list tonight.

1258
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,641
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll come back with a list list.

1259
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:34,283
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not telling you the topic until we come back.

1260
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:39,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be kind of a longer break, but that's okay because we're going to play some good shit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1261
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

1262
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:24,380
Thanks for watching!

1263
01:27:35,259 --> 01:27:36,260
Thank you for watching!

1264
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,251
Thank you for watching!

1265
01:31:42,317 --> 01:31:43,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1266
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:54,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1267
01:33:22,558 --> 01:33:23,159
Thanks for watching!

1268
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:27,032
Thanks for watching!

1269
01:35:45,572 --> 01:35:48,845
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound of goodbye is louder

1270
01:36:57,885 --> 01:37:02,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1271
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:03,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?

1272
01:37:04,028 --> 01:37:04,369
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

1273
01:37:04,489 --> 01:37:08,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we care what people think of us?

1274
01:37:08,771 --> 01:37:10,612
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

1275
01:37:10,632 --> 01:37:12,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1276
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:14,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!

1277
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:21,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1278
01:37:23,873 --> 01:37:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we are back.

1279
01:37:24,934 --> 01:37:28,736
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 15.

1280
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:33,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We, as promised, are going to do a listless, one of our favorite segments on this show.

1281
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:33,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1282
01:37:34,339 --> 01:37:35,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we get to make decisions.

1283
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And you just have to deal with our list.

1284
01:37:38,842 --> 01:37:43,324
[SPEAKER_09]: We put it down and we say this is the best or worst ever.

1285
01:37:43,684 --> 01:37:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Our word is law.

1286
01:37:44,885 --> 01:37:45,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It is law.

1287
01:37:45,545 --> 01:37:46,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Resistance is futile.

1288
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:53,875
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, but really the final, ultimate decision lies with you guys in the chat room.

1289
01:37:54,395 --> 01:38:03,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So, get into our chat, yeah, don't fuck up, and get into our chat room right now at irc.eggheads.org, Channel Pound, Orange Lounge, and you can vote on our list.

1290
01:38:04,004 --> 01:38:14,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically the way Listless works, we're gonna give a topic, and then I'm gonna give three songs in that topic, we're gonna give our top three, all the four guests here tonight, Jamie, and then Dave and Loki, we're all gonna give their top three answers.

1291
01:38:14,834 --> 01:38:15,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes!

1292
01:38:15,968 --> 01:38:19,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the host and the guest.

1293
01:38:19,671 --> 01:38:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, did I put you on the... I meant the host, Jamie, and the guest.

1294
01:38:23,213 --> 01:38:24,875
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't see my hand motions, that's why.

1295
01:38:24,895 --> 01:38:34,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be revealing our top three, and then...

1296
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The chatroom votes.

1297
01:38:38,058 --> 01:38:38,258
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1298
01:38:38,598 --> 01:38:40,079
[SPEAKER_09]: No, then there's the elimination round.

1299
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:40,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Our favorite part.

1300
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,180
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this game the best?

1301
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,141
[SPEAKER_09]: We piss each other off.

1302
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:46,683
[SPEAKER_09]: We piss each other off by taking one off the list.

1303
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:49,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Then each one of us gets to take one off the list.

1304
01:38:50,385 --> 01:38:53,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the finalized list, you guys vote on and we get a top three right from there.

1305
01:38:55,214 --> 01:38:56,555
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the topic you ask?

1306
01:38:56,695 --> 01:38:57,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a topical topic.

1307
01:38:58,215 --> 01:39:00,196
[SPEAKER_19]: What song do you best like to pick your nose to?

1308
01:39:00,356 --> 01:39:05,898
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is what... It's going along with what's being in the Bimani world right now.

1309
01:39:06,058 --> 01:39:10,940
[SPEAKER_09]: What Konami original song that's not already in DDR do you want... Hold your horses.

1310
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tell you the topic when we're damn ready to.

1311
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:13,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling them right now.

1312
01:39:14,483 --> 01:39:19,086
[SPEAKER_09]: What Konami original that hasn't already been in DDR would you most like to see in Max 3?

1313
01:39:20,026 --> 01:39:27,291
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you vote for on the site to determine what song should be in Max 3?

1314
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:28,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami original.

1315
01:39:30,392 --> 01:39:30,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Dave.

1316
01:39:32,694 --> 01:39:37,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so this is any... Are you starting this?

1317
01:39:37,298 --> 01:39:38,679
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's Konami original.

1318
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:39,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be Konami original.

1319
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,561
[SPEAKER_10]: What does Konami original mean?

1320
01:39:41,941 --> 01:39:43,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you already make a list without Konami?

1321
01:39:43,543 --> 01:39:44,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.

1322
01:39:44,123 --> 01:39:45,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the difference is.

1323
01:39:46,225 --> 01:39:47,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1324
01:39:47,626 --> 01:39:49,147
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to take another break.

1325
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:49,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

1326
01:39:50,428 --> 01:39:50,608
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1327
01:39:51,528 --> 01:39:52,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine, no breaks.

1328
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:59,411
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a song like any song in Beatmania that was by Konami, you know, Naoki or something, that hasn't already been in DDR.

1329
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:02,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think if they were by Konami or not.

1330
01:40:04,393 --> 01:40:05,193
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let you know.

1331
01:40:05,673 --> 01:40:06,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, Dave.

1332
01:40:06,514 --> 01:40:07,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let you know.

1333
01:40:07,094 --> 01:40:08,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we start with Dave?

1334
01:40:08,094 --> 01:40:09,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave, what is your number three?

1335
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:10,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1336
01:40:10,735 --> 01:40:13,778
[SPEAKER_10]: The number three choice is V. Good morning, Dave.

1337
01:40:14,078 --> 01:40:14,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that qualified?

1338
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: V, yes, V counts.

1339
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,061
[SPEAKER_09]: V is Taka.

1340
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:18,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll count.

1341
01:40:18,923 --> 01:40:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's less work for Rob to type.

1342
01:40:20,865 --> 01:40:22,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's very little work for me to type.

1343
01:40:22,907 --> 01:40:23,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, next!

1344
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:32,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was a very difficult decision, but I'm going to have to go with Instant Love.

1345
01:40:32,496 --> 01:40:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Instant Love!

1346
01:40:33,377 --> 01:40:33,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah!

1347
01:40:33,577 --> 01:40:34,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that would show up.

1348
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:35,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, cool.

1349
01:40:37,372 --> 01:40:38,432
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not by Good Cool.

1350
01:40:38,452 --> 01:40:40,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's by... No, I said Dude Cool.

1351
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:41,713
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought you said Good Cool.

1352
01:40:44,814 --> 01:40:46,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, what's your number three choice?

1353
01:40:46,294 --> 01:40:47,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, any reason why?

1354
01:40:47,114 --> 01:40:48,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to ask the reasons why.

1355
01:40:48,755 --> 01:40:49,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Why Instant Love?

1356
01:40:49,935 --> 01:40:54,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, if they've got to put Let Them Move in there, at least make it a good remix of it.

1357
01:40:55,116 --> 01:40:55,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1358
01:40:56,576 --> 01:40:57,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dave, your reason for V?

1359
01:40:58,997 --> 01:40:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good song.

1360
01:41:00,441 --> 01:41:12,045
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I actually have to vouch for V, because for anyone who's played Pump It Up, there basically is winter in Pump It Up, and it's freaking amazing, so I fully already know what it would be like.

1361
01:41:13,065 --> 01:41:22,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So for my number three choice, I actually have to go with Release Your Mind, because, you know, I'm a tax whore.

1362
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:25,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough, Release Your Mind.

1363
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:28,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm typing with one hand.

1364
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:33,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh oh, better get that plastic cover ready Just because Tack owns, that's it?

1365
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:34,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your reason?

1366
01:41:35,187 --> 01:41:40,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm secretly in love with Tack I guess it's not much of a secret anymore, is it?

1367
01:41:41,403 --> 01:41:41,423
[SPEAKER_09]: V35

1368
01:42:09,196 --> 01:42:13,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I fucking love that song, it's 8th style, and if you don't like it, you can suck my dick.

1369
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:16,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Dave, your number two choice.

1370
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:21,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my number two choice is Give Me a Sign.

1371
01:42:21,748 --> 01:42:25,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Won't you give me some affection if you do, how much you like?

1372
01:42:25,112 --> 01:42:26,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because that song ruined it.

1373
01:42:26,413 --> 01:42:27,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I promised I wouldn't sing tonight, I'm sorry.

1374
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:31,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it would make a good song.

1375
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's just our little songbird tonight.

1376
01:42:36,573 --> 01:42:38,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki, your number two choice.

1377
01:42:38,879 --> 01:42:44,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Diary, today I heard someone like the song that I really didn't like.

1378
01:42:45,288 --> 01:42:49,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to go to America and, quote, suck his dick.

1379
01:42:50,369 --> 01:42:57,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, now, my number two song would have to be, and you heard it during the break, VJ Army.

1380
01:42:57,651 --> 01:42:58,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, VJ Army.

1381
01:42:58,452 --> 01:43:03,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's already a DWI for it out there already, and it's an awesome song.

1382
01:43:03,453 --> 01:43:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And it reminds me of Wild Rush because it's got a bunch of different styles of music in there, kind of all blend together.

1383
01:43:08,314 --> 01:43:09,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of fucked up.

1384
01:43:09,235 --> 01:43:09,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

1385
01:43:10,675 --> 01:43:11,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1386
01:43:11,415 --> 01:43:12,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, your number two choice.

1387
01:43:13,156 --> 01:43:14,136
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two choice.

1388
01:43:16,557 --> 01:43:18,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have to be more tack.

1389
01:43:19,258 --> 01:43:19,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Indigo Vision.

1390
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:21,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Indigo Vision.

1391
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I want to do the freaking da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da steps, you know.

1392
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,761
[SPEAKER_03]: That would just be so cool.

1393
01:43:27,421 --> 01:43:27,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

1394
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:29,822
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two choice.

1395
01:43:30,582 --> 01:43:31,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't like this, I kill you.

1396
01:43:32,543 --> 01:43:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: You also heard this during the break.

1397
01:43:34,503 --> 01:43:35,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Love is orange.

1398
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:37,544
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be so awesome to dance.

1399
01:43:37,565 --> 01:43:38,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than love is dreaminess.

1400
01:43:41,618 --> 01:43:43,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey now, watch out, that could be my number one.

1401
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:44,459
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know.

1402
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:47,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love Love is Dreaminess.

1403
01:43:48,741 --> 01:43:49,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, I hate that.

1404
01:43:51,322 --> 01:43:53,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my number one.

1405
01:43:53,202 --> 01:43:53,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, dude.

1406
01:43:54,043 --> 01:43:54,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one.

1407
01:43:54,783 --> 01:43:56,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami original.

1408
01:43:56,404 --> 01:43:57,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Drumroll, you hope.

1409
01:43:57,504 --> 01:43:59,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it qualifies for Konami.

1410
01:43:59,325 --> 01:44:00,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll buzz you, don't worry.

1411
01:44:00,585 --> 01:44:01,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a wow wow 70s.

1412
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow Wow 70s.

1413
01:44:04,188 --> 01:44:07,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah, Sampling Masters, I think they count.

1414
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:08,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Sampling Masters will count, I think.

1415
01:44:09,152 --> 01:44:12,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now that would be cool just because the afros would be in the video.

1416
01:44:12,395 --> 01:44:17,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and it would, like, if you listen to it, it would make a really good song for the steps.

1417
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,101
[SPEAKER_10]: It would go along really well.

1418
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:20,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow Wow 70s to its own.

1419
01:44:21,383 --> 01:44:21,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

1420
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:25,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Your number one Konami original ever, ever, ever, ever.

1421
01:44:25,903 --> 01:44:26,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I just love this song.

1422
01:44:27,184 --> 01:44:28,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, ever since I heard it.

1423
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:30,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Outer Limits.

1424
01:44:31,706 --> 01:44:33,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Outer Limits.

1425
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:43,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping when you said outer that you'd say outer wall, but... Jamie, your number one.

1426
01:44:43,686 --> 01:44:44,366
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one.

1427
01:44:45,686 --> 01:44:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a toss-up, but I'm going to have to go with Happy Hopper.

1428
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:49,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Hopper.

1429
01:44:49,847 --> 01:44:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be insane to play.

1430
01:44:52,848 --> 01:44:56,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm requiring... Oops, I put Happer Hopper.

1431
01:44:57,669 --> 01:45:00,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm requiring that you play that during the deliberation music, because I say so.

1432
01:45:01,089 --> 01:45:01,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1433
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:03,310
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one.

1434
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:04,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Lab, you're wrong.

1435
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:06,950
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't put Summer Vacation, although that's not a bad idea.

1436
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,231
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one is Flotation.

1437
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:10,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, I fucked up.

1438
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:12,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Original!

1439
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:12,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Original!

1440
01:45:12,811 --> 01:45:13,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid American!

1441
01:45:13,571 --> 01:45:13,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Beep, beep, beep!

1442
01:45:13,951 --> 01:45:13,971
[SPEAKER_09]: V!

1443
01:45:36,673 --> 01:45:49,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Gimme A Sign, VJ Army, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, Wow Wow 70s, Outer Limits, Happy Hopper, and 321 Stars.

1444
01:45:49,922 --> 01:45:53,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we get to do our favorite part, and that is the deletion round.

1445
01:45:53,484 --> 01:45:55,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So, let's start with Dave.

1446
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:56,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave, what song...

1447
01:45:57,575 --> 01:45:59,476
[SPEAKER_09]: is so sucky it needs to come off this list.

1448
01:46:00,556 --> 01:46:06,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... I'm... Rob's gonna poop on me, but 3, 2, 1, start.

1449
01:46:06,898 --> 01:46:07,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you!

1450
01:46:07,659 --> 01:46:08,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you, die!

1451
01:46:09,719 --> 01:46:10,540
[SPEAKER_17]: He gon' cut you!

1452
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to cut you.

1453
01:46:14,686 --> 01:46:15,707
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I'm going to cut so many people.

1454
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:17,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to stick you.

1455
01:46:17,809 --> 01:46:19,591
[SPEAKER_10]: That song rules.

1456
01:46:19,992 --> 01:46:20,793
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two.

1457
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,575
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two, three, four.

1458
01:46:23,115 --> 01:46:25,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Play Breakdown if you want to hear one, two, three, four.

1459
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to need to buy Rob a rototiller so he can run over everybody.

1460
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:28,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate you all.

1461
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:29,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out of my house.

1462
01:46:29,663 --> 01:46:32,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, if you want to hear one, two, three, four, you play Crash.

1463
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:34,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1464
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:36,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get you.

1465
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:42,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to say, give me a sign, because R&B is so fourth mix.

1466
01:46:43,467 --> 01:46:46,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So, down with this R&B stuff.

1467
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:47,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a sign.

1468
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's got lesbians in the video.

1469
01:46:49,091 --> 01:46:49,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

1470
01:46:50,959 --> 01:46:52,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I should have picked Summer Vacation.

1471
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

1472
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:53,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah.

1473
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it because the list is getting really hard for me to choose what to take off.

1474
01:46:58,322 --> 01:47:00,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And as much as I like the song, I'd have to say take off VJ Army.

1475
01:47:02,684 --> 01:47:03,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Shock, VJ Army.

1476
01:47:03,904 --> 01:47:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually really pissed off at that song right now anyway.

1477
01:47:07,826 --> 01:47:08,506
[SPEAKER_09]: What's left?

1478
01:47:08,586 --> 01:47:11,547
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got all these pretty good, decent songs left.

1479
01:47:15,809 --> 01:47:16,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1480
01:47:16,589 --> 01:47:17,390
[SPEAKER_09]: This is too hard.

1481
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:18,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't decide.

1482
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:20,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take off...

1483
01:47:23,214 --> 01:47:26,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be a complete asshole.

1484
01:47:27,017 --> 01:47:32,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I don't see this song in DDR, no matter what you say, no matter what you compare it to.

1485
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:34,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't see this song in DDR.

1486
01:47:35,323 --> 01:47:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking off V. You know, it works.

1487
01:47:40,406 --> 01:47:42,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's freaking evil in Pump It Up, though.

1488
01:47:43,048 --> 01:47:45,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the rest of the songs there.

1489
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:49,393
[SPEAKER_09]: V is a 2DX song, it's a Keyboard Mania song, it's not a DDR song for me, so...

1490
01:47:50,523 --> 01:47:51,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait till you see it in motion.

1491
01:47:51,584 --> 01:47:52,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

1492
01:47:52,545 --> 01:47:53,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to see someone play that on Pump It Up.

1493
01:47:54,266 --> 01:47:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, nah.

1494
01:47:54,846 --> 01:47:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to see someone play it on Pump It Up.

1495
01:47:56,548 --> 01:47:56,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, nah.

1496
01:47:58,322 --> 01:47:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

1497
01:47:59,183 --> 01:47:59,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

1498
01:47:59,943 --> 01:48:00,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

1499
01:48:27,588 --> 01:48:29,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be like, ha ha!

1500
01:48:29,989 --> 01:48:31,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the full list.

1501
01:48:31,289 --> 01:48:34,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm posting it to the chat room right now, and then you can send me your votes.

1502
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:39,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Except I'm having to clear out the messages I've already gotten here.

1503
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:40,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to clear these out.

1504
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:43,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here we go.

1505
01:48:44,052 --> 01:48:44,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's your choices.

1506
01:48:44,972 --> 01:48:45,872
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to read that off, Jamie?

1507
01:48:46,232 --> 01:48:49,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, as soon as you pull the thing up and start it.

1508
01:48:49,953 --> 01:49:00,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Indigo Vision, Love is Orange, Wow Wow 70s Afro, Outer Limits, and Happy Hopper.

1509
01:49:00,518 --> 01:49:03,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a personal note, I'd just like to say that everything that I picked is still there.

1510
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:04,339
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though?

1511
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:04,980
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though?

1512
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:08,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, Jim, now that I'm looking at the list again, I probably should have taken off Release Your Mind, I think.

1513
01:49:08,481 --> 01:49:09,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I'm looking at it.

1514
01:49:09,682 --> 01:49:10,622
[SPEAKER_09]: But, oh well.

1515
01:49:10,642 --> 01:49:11,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Too late.

1516
01:49:11,102 --> 01:49:11,903
[SPEAKER_07]: What's done is done.

1517
01:49:12,763 --> 01:49:16,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I did V. So send me your votes over private message.

1518
01:49:16,844 --> 01:49:22,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've only got a minute and a half to do it because we've got to hurry up and end this show because I've got to get out of town.

1519
01:49:22,966 --> 01:49:26,007
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to play Happy Hopper because Jamie said so.

1520
01:49:26,627 --> 01:49:27,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be right back.

1521
01:49:27,247 --> 01:49:28,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've only got a minute and a half.

1522
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:29,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Send those votes now, now, now, now, now.

1523
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:36,713
Thank you for watching!

1524
01:52:55,405 --> 01:53:01,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?

1525
01:53:01,351 --> 01:53:08,497
[SPEAKER_12]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1526
01:53:08,817 --> 01:53:10,799
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unearthly.

1527
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:14,743
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1528
01:53:15,871 --> 01:53:17,854
[SPEAKER_09]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1529
01:53:17,894 --> 01:53:20,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We're back to wrap up this little train wreck we've got going.

1530
01:53:21,038 --> 01:53:24,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to do that by revealing the top three winners.

1531
01:53:25,043 --> 01:53:28,728
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a pretty good tie going there for a while, but we did resolve it.

1532
01:53:29,068 --> 01:53:29,649
[SPEAKER_09]: It did resolve.

1533
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:31,211
[SPEAKER_09]: We have four songs all tied to one point.

1534
01:53:32,125 --> 01:53:32,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1535
01:53:33,285 --> 01:53:37,786
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had somebody change their vote, which really kind of just did it right there.

1536
01:53:37,826 --> 01:53:39,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of broke all the ties we had.

1537
01:53:40,307 --> 01:53:41,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we have the final list.

1538
01:53:41,967 --> 01:53:46,808
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the Konami original we most want to see in Max 3 through the voting.

1539
01:53:48,408 --> 01:53:50,509
[SPEAKER_09]: WowWow70s is in third place.

1540
01:53:50,749 --> 01:53:51,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1541
01:53:52,129 --> 01:53:52,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Afro.

1542
01:53:52,429 --> 01:53:52,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Afro.

1543
01:53:52,969 --> 01:53:53,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Afro.

1544
01:53:53,949 --> 01:53:56,490
[SPEAKER_09]: In second place, Outer Limits.

1545
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:58,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1546
01:54:01,812 --> 01:54:02,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I sense a personal grudge.

1547
01:54:04,473 --> 01:54:05,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just pissed because I took V off.

1548
01:54:07,093 --> 01:54:07,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch.

1549
01:54:08,094 --> 01:54:12,095
[SPEAKER_09]: In first place, this is the only drumroll I have, so deal with it.

1550
01:54:13,795 --> 01:54:15,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Hopper wins!

1551
01:54:15,735 --> 01:54:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I rule and I have good taste.

1552
01:54:18,396 --> 01:54:25,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Hopper is the... And you know, we're actually somewhat unsure if that's a Konami original, aren't we?

1553
01:54:25,778 --> 01:54:26,158
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of...

1554
01:54:27,065 --> 01:54:34,665
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to say it is I would like to play Tetris while playing Happy Hopper It wins, so Happy Hopper wins Because we said so

1555
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:36,558
[SPEAKER_09]: We said so.

1556
01:54:36,918 --> 01:54:40,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to have to kind of wrap up the show here.

1557
01:54:40,119 --> 01:54:42,300
[SPEAKER_09]: We're coming into the last home stretch here.

1558
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:45,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to remind everybody that Sunday's show will be pre-taped.

1559
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:47,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on into the chat room.

1560
01:54:47,602 --> 01:54:50,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Our regulars will be there and talking about the pre-taped show as it's going on.

1561
01:54:51,023 --> 01:54:54,604
[SPEAKER_09]: If you live in the Sacramento or Bay Area, join us at Sacramento Scandia.

1562
01:54:54,644 --> 01:54:55,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's going to be Thursday night.

1563
01:54:55,945 --> 01:55:00,466
[SPEAKER_09]: But please, please check the forums on sakbamani.com for any changes.

1564
01:55:00,906 --> 01:55:02,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room, praise y'all?

1565
01:55:02,307 --> 01:55:03,087
[SPEAKER_03]: No, praise me.

1566
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:07,531
[SPEAKER_09]: and Instant Love came in fourth.

1567
01:55:07,771 --> 01:55:10,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Instant Love was the one that was also tied in there, by the way.

1568
01:55:10,413 --> 01:55:12,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody changed their vote from Instant Love to something else.

1569
01:55:12,235 --> 01:55:13,336
[SPEAKER_17]: It was winning for a while.

1570
01:55:13,356 --> 01:55:16,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was winning for a while and then a bunch of people changed their votes.

1571
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:17,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So, whatever.

1572
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are interesting.

1573
01:55:18,221 --> 01:55:19,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, DJ Konami.

1574
01:55:19,181 --> 01:55:19,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1575
01:55:19,542 --> 01:55:20,182
[SPEAKER_17]: We still love you.

1576
01:55:20,443 --> 01:55:23,065
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Konami was the only one that ended up voting for Instant Love.

1577
01:55:23,105 --> 01:55:24,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone else changed their votes.

1578
01:55:25,369 --> 01:55:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the dance floor is waiting for you.

1579
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:28,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Another reminder.

1580
01:55:28,391 --> 01:55:29,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to also apologize.

1581
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:31,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Thursday's rebroadcast didn't happen.

1582
01:55:31,995 --> 01:55:37,099
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my fault because work got in the way and I wasn't able to queue up the replay in time.

1583
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize to those of you that were listening Thursday for the rebroadcast.

1584
01:55:39,962 --> 01:55:43,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But we will do this Thursday's rebroadcast at 2 p.m.

1585
01:55:43,805 --> 01:55:47,388
[SPEAKER_09]: along with our Monday broadcast at 7 p.m., our rebroadcast.

1586
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:54,252
[SPEAKER_09]: and Saturday there will be no Orange Lounge at all because Live 365 will be down.

1587
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So every Live 365 station will be off air that night.

1588
01:55:57,933 --> 01:56:00,094
[SPEAKER_03]: They're moving to an underground bunker server.

1589
01:56:00,234 --> 01:56:06,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they're moving to an underground bunker so that Britney Spears and all those people doing the commercials, Stevie Wonder and all them can't get to them.

1590
01:56:07,017 --> 01:56:09,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Stevie Wonder can't find us.

1591
01:56:09,258 --> 01:56:10,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Britney Spears is rabid.

1592
01:56:10,859 --> 01:56:11,659
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll bite one of them.

1593
01:56:12,836 --> 01:56:13,676
[SPEAKER_09]: and give him herpes.

1594
01:56:14,216 --> 01:56:15,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Or herpes.

1595
01:56:17,297 --> 01:56:18,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Also known as cold sores.

1596
01:56:18,537 --> 01:56:19,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

1597
01:56:20,177 --> 01:56:21,778
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to give him little icky crawly things.

1598
01:56:23,418 --> 01:56:24,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, I did it again.

1599
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:25,518
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?

1600
01:56:28,039 --> 01:56:28,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, what else?

1601
01:56:28,699 --> 01:56:31,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, you can get an STD by playing DDR Max.

1602
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:38,080
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to get this thing wrapped up, so some final thoughts.

1603
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you got any final... Oh, I'm sorry, you have an ooh.

1604
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:41,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You have an ooh, Matt?

1605
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:45,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Were we going to play the stupid song?

1606
01:56:46,411 --> 01:56:48,352
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have to bump that to next week.

1607
01:56:48,532 --> 01:56:53,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we were talking too long about... I don't know, what were we talking too long about?

1608
01:56:53,354 --> 01:57:05,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Diary, I made the stupid American show last too long because my segment was just as... Yeah, we bitched about DDR Max USA for too long and all that controversy going on there.

1609
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:07,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget about Conjoined Twin Galaxies.

1610
01:57:08,913 --> 01:57:21,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, and while we're queuing up the end of the show here, um, some update, nothing really going on, there are the DDR, um, or the Dancing Stage Remix 2 DWIs out there, so look for them, find them, they're pretty fun to play, really easy.

1611
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, other than that, DDR spots still down, still waiting for them to come up, I don't know why.

1612
01:57:27,763 --> 01:57:29,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have asked, you know, Mike Noah's in town.

1613
01:57:29,824 --> 01:57:32,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have asked him because he was right there, but I didn't even think to ask.

1614
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:33,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed that site.

1615
01:57:33,225 --> 01:57:33,625
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1616
01:57:33,705 --> 01:57:34,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's down.

1617
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:39,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Really the only other news that we have to wait for is what new song is going to be announced on Wednesday.

1618
01:57:39,988 --> 01:57:40,568
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

1619
01:57:41,468 --> 01:57:41,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty easy.

1620
01:57:42,729 --> 01:57:43,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1621
01:57:44,209 --> 01:57:45,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Any final thoughts from you, Dave?

1622
01:57:48,371 --> 01:57:49,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Kachaka owns.

1623
01:57:50,372 --> 01:57:52,573
[SPEAKER_10]: And my word of the week is philosophical.

1624
01:57:53,413 --> 01:57:56,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you were at the party last night, you know what I mean.

1625
01:57:57,977 --> 01:58:02,120
[SPEAKER_08]: and also like to announce that I'll be doing news on Team Guilo now that they're back up.

1626
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:02,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1627
01:58:02,961 --> 01:58:05,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make you a member of Team Guilo or does that mean you're doing news?

1628
01:58:05,403 --> 01:58:06,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I never understood how their team was.

1629
01:58:06,624 --> 01:58:09,506
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they were going to give me stickers and bribe me with stickers and stuff.

1630
01:58:09,626 --> 01:58:10,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's cool.

1631
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:10,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1632
01:58:11,047 --> 01:58:13,489
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to work in some plugs for Orange Lounge.

1633
01:58:13,509 --> 01:58:14,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I've been doing that.

1634
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good boy.

1635
01:58:15,971 --> 01:58:16,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we like them.

1636
01:58:17,112 --> 01:58:17,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We like getting plugs.

1637
01:58:18,393 --> 01:58:20,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And my final thought of the week, rave!

1638
01:58:21,015 --> 01:58:21,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Rave!

1639
01:58:24,904 --> 01:58:26,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, this is so good.

1640
01:58:26,646 --> 01:58:27,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

1641
01:58:27,186 --> 01:58:29,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm so fucked up right now.

1642
01:58:29,708 --> 01:58:32,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the room is spinning.

1643
01:58:32,691 --> 01:58:34,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a hug.

1644
01:58:34,512 --> 01:58:36,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you guys.

1645
01:58:36,294 --> 01:58:38,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you guys.

1646
01:58:38,236 --> 01:58:40,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that guy.

1647
01:58:40,558 --> 01:58:41,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I was petting.

1648
01:58:41,999 --> 01:58:44,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We were just rubbing and petting.

1649
01:58:44,721 --> 01:58:45,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Go hug him.

1650
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:57,805
[SPEAKER_15]: If you like guns, if you like shooting, if you like action, and if you're going to rent the movies, rent them at Tam's Video on Irving and 22nd.

1651
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:23,379
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your membership number?

1652
01:59:30,401 --> 01:59:30,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1653
01:59:32,662 --> 01:59:34,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know is your membership number?

1654
01:59:39,784 --> 01:59:45,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't believe you've really had the San Francisco experience until you've been abused by a Chinese person.

1655
01:59:50,086 --> 01:59:53,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
