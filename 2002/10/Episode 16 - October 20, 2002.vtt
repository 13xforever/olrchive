01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

One...

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000

He's good.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Nested by that much.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

How can you tell?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
You are the weakest thing to bite.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
So you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

Skye.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000

DarkSakura, my lovely co-host, is stuck in a bit of traffic right now just outside of San Francisco.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
She gave me a call about 6 o'clock, and she was stuck right before the bridge in San Francisco.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
She, by the way, this weekend, went to YowieCon.

It takes us deep, but then

09:37.100 --> 09:39.100
I went for a run from now.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
But it still felt so good and hard

09:41.100 --> 09:43.100

Leave a running cold mess, serving, drinking a train

To the next station, on the dancehall

10:07.100 --> 10:08.100
A rock of the nation

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
The sound, it's coming out now

10:10.100 --> 10:12.100
For DJ, looking so loud

10:12.100 --> 10:14.100
Dancin', I make the body laugh

10:14.100 --> 10:16.100
Blooddrain, water in the wall top

10:16.100 --> 10:18.100
Like a fist, I keep on turnin'

10:18.100 --> 10:20.100
Like a fire, I keep on burnin'

10:20.100 --> 10:22.100
I live, dance around in a place

10:22.100 --> 10:41.800
Beach and Wife, the pretty f

10:41.800 --> 10:46.800
the

10:46.800 --> 10:51.800
the

10:51.800 --> 10:56.800
the

10:56.800 --> 11:01.800
the

11:01.800 --> 11:06.800
the

11:36.800 --> 11:41.800
.

11:41.800 --> 11:46.800
.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.800
.

11:51.800 --> 11:56.800
.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.800
.

12:01.800 --> 12:30.800
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
Orange Lounge Radio

13:00.800 --> 13:03.960
We're going to have the ketchup song because we have the Macarena in the first one.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.200
Oh, happy day.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.520
My thoughts exactly.

13:09.520 --> 13:15.640
I want to take a minute at the very top of the show here to recognize my other show that

13:15.640 --> 13:20.000
I've been participating in for the last 20 months, undersedationalive.org.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.880
And for those that didn't hear, the show came to an end, I believe two weeks ago was the

13:24.880 --> 13:29.040
last show because Live 365 was off this past week and unfortunately there were some circumstances

13:29.040 --> 13:34.280
that developed which caused our program to go off of air, but, you know, people sometimes

13:34.280 --> 13:37.760
have to go off to pursue better opportunities, and that's what our main host of that show

13:37.760 --> 13:39.040
had to do.

13:39.040 --> 13:43.080
So I just wanted to give a big thanks to everybody involved with that program, understationlive.org,

13:43.080 --> 13:48.880
for the past 20 months, it was a fun time, and without that background coming into this,

13:48.880 --> 13:50.460
I don't think this show would exist.

13:50.460 --> 13:54.340
So if you guys have a moment when you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go check out the

13:54.340 --> 13:58.560
understationlive archives, they're still up and running, and who knows, Travis the main

13:58.560 --> 14:04.720
host over there might be doing a big revival when he's over, he's out there in Texas, he

14:04.720 --> 14:07.880
moved out to Texas, he might do something with some new co-hosts and I definitely would

14:07.880 --> 14:13.460
support him in doing something like that. So, big thanks to everybody at understationlive.org.

14:13.460 --> 14:18.360
Now back to Orange Lounge Radio, here we are, we're back from break last week, we were also

14:18.360 --> 14:23.580
breaking last week, breaking what, I don't know. Oh, breaking all time low listening

14:23.580 --> 14:30.580
records for our tape show, that's for sure. No, actually, it was fine. What did you think

14:30.900 --> 14:33.300
of that show, Brad? It was interesting, wasn't it?

14:33.300 --> 14:36.380
Did you hear the show? Yeah, I had to dump the whole tape and edit

14:36.380 --> 14:42.220
it together. I heard the show. It was... We always tend to get a very mixed reaction

14:42.220 --> 14:44.940
from the chat room when we do those tapes. That was the second time we taped a show in

14:44.940 --> 14:46.340
advance. So that one was the one from Scandio?

14:46.340 --> 14:48.940
That was the Scandio one we taped a couple weeks ago.

14:48.940 --> 14:52.820
My opinion is the Golf Land one was better. Because you were on it, right?

14:52.820 --> 14:55.940
no i was not you know you are on the call for a while

14:55.940 --> 14:57.060
those that

14:57.060 --> 14:58.020
uh...

14:58.020 --> 14:59.460
no uh...

14:59.460 --> 15:02.460
it was better because when the person when you went downstairs to play hip-hop

15:02.460 --> 15:05.860
many that's true and the person was like what are you doing here that's real

15:05.860 --> 15:08.720
project and that you know uh... teeth

15:08.720 --> 15:12.260
keep the wonderful of our key technician over a scandia that's uh... who can

15:12.260 --> 15:14.460
replace up to the exit style of week

15:14.460 --> 15:16.240
sent to a channel b

15:16.240 --> 15:17.220
can cooperate

15:17.220 --> 15:19.780
uh...

15:19.780 --> 15:23.400
He was totally cool what was going on so he knew nothing like that was gonna happen now

15:23.400 --> 15:27.660
I should have staged something like that. That would've been good radio, huh? Getting something like that staged

15:27.880 --> 15:32.600
Maybe I could have had Jamie, you know change her voice a little bit and come out going. Hey you guys

15:33.240 --> 15:35.240
Yeah, gee

15:37.240 --> 15:41.000
Speaking of Jamie if you missed the opening of the show, she's not gonna be with us tonight

15:41.000 --> 15:45.280
Actually, we're not sure she might show up for the last half of the show, but she's on the road right now

15:45.280 --> 15:48.320
She's come back from Frisco. She's gonna be going to the big yaoi con

15:48.320 --> 15:52.440
You guys would appreciate this, I mentioned this at the top of the show, we got more people

15:52.440 --> 15:53.440
that just joined us.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.440
They would not appreciate it, yeah.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.880
I don't know, but you'd appreciate this little sense of humor.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.460
Would you, Irene, I think you'd be the best person here to explain to our listening audience

16:00.460 --> 16:02.520
what exactly yaoi is.

16:02.520 --> 16:09.760
Isn't it basically like, gay anime, like male gay anime with pretty boys?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
Fair enough.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.200
Oh, Loki wants to contribute something.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.080
I thought it was gay anime porn, from what I've heard.

16:17.080 --> 16:21.800
From what I understand, it's not really porn, it's all implied.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.720
It's all like implied porn, you know?

16:23.720 --> 16:28.320
I don't know how you imply porno, but just, like a, like a Skinimax film.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.600
It's like a, it's like a gay Skinimax film, but it's animated in a Japanese style.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
Huh?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.080
I'm glad that I never heard of this before.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.800
Anyway, so I don't even know if she made it to YowieCon.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.760
I think they ended up just going to Frisco, but I did hear this joke from Tal, one of

16:41.760 --> 16:43.900
our, he's been here, I guess, before.

16:43.900 --> 16:49.400
his girlfriend, big yaoi fan. Big yaoi fan. And she was at the con and one of my friends

16:49.400 --> 16:53.920
was dropping her off, mentioned that, oh yeah, at the yaoi con, on one side of the hotel,

16:53.920 --> 16:57.260
they're doing the yaoi con, the other side of the hotel looks like they're doing the

16:57.260 --> 17:04.260
Church of Christ Youth Ministry Convention. It's not a joke, this is for real.

17:05.020 --> 17:10.020
Oh, you're serious? Yes, I'm serious. That was like the very first time I ever played

17:10.020 --> 17:13.360
was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.360
Irene was there.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.360
Irene was there.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.360
Irene knows about this.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.360
Okay.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.360
I have to tell you about the actual convention the first day.

17:18.360 --> 17:23.160
It was Rocky Horror picture in one door and right next door, the gun show.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.160
The gun show.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.520
With a bunch of hicks and they hated Asian people and I was so scared.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.660
I was like, oh my God, I'm going to die.

17:28.660 --> 17:33.120
It was a bunch of cart carrying NRA members mixed in with guys dressed in drag doing the

17:33.120 --> 17:34.120
whole Frank-N-Furter thing.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.240
If you've ever seen Rocky Horror, you know what I'm talking about.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.920
If you haven't, you should.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.920
It's fun.

17:38.920 --> 17:45.920
where you been? Where you been? Wake up! Go outside! Stop playing DDR! Put the controller down!

17:46.500 --> 17:51.640
You know one thing that Travis, the host over at understationlive.org recommended to me

17:51.640 --> 17:53.360
was that

17:53.360 --> 17:57.080
we should take, now that that show is going to be gone, we should take some of that and

17:57.080 --> 17:58.240
bring it to

17:58.240 --> 18:01.960
Orange Lounge and just get really random on that show. Because you know Under Station Live was supposed to be

18:01.960 --> 18:06.140
a Rocky Horror show, and in the beginning it was. It was just like We Are With Bomani.

18:06.140 --> 18:19.500
I was going to say, wasn't that show number two?

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
What?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
Where it all turned to hell?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
Oh yeah, I still got it.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.140
Even show number one was kind of...

18:24.140 --> 18:25.140
Remember when we had this...

18:25.140 --> 18:27.580
You know it's funny that we're reminiscing about something that just happened three months

18:27.580 --> 18:28.580
ago or...

18:28.580 --> 18:29.580
Where are we?

18:29.580 --> 18:30.580
Episode sixteen.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.580
It was about four months ago.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.020
Where we had those little headsets that sounded like shit.

18:35.020 --> 18:39.020
I felt like I was back in the call center, taking calls, you know?

18:39.020 --> 18:41.020
Thank you for calling, how may I direct your call?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.020
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio!

18:43.020 --> 18:50.020
It's kind of, I guess the word would be ironic that we're talking about how sooner or later we'll get off topic,

18:50.020 --> 18:53.020
and while we're talking about this, we're getting off topic!

18:53.020 --> 18:56.020
Ah, fuck DDR, it's old!

18:56.020 --> 18:58.020
We had a topic?

19:01.020 --> 19:03.020
Yeah, we have the donuts, Rob.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.020
You have to go get them!

19:34.020 --> 19:39.120
up to something we've been talking about for weeks and weeks on the show. If you go over

19:39.120 --> 19:46.240
to http://www.cagames.com, that stands for Cryptic Illusion Games, they've released a

19:46.240 --> 19:53.320
new home-brewed Dreamcast game. And if you have a Dreamcast and you've got a CD burner,

19:53.320 --> 19:57.760
then you should burn this. This is the Feet of Fury, which is this new release of a DDR

19:57.760 --> 20:03.120
simulator. I'm not sure if you want to call it a simulator, a clone. It's not an emulator.

20:03.120 --> 20:09.120
I always get criticized on this because I call things emulators to be simulated. What would you categorize this as, Louis?

20:09.120 --> 20:32.120
It's just another game that's similar to DDR. It's basically like Dance Match Mode from Disney's Rave, and it just so happens to support the DWI format, sort of, because it doesn't have tempo changes, you know, tempo stops, free zeroes, or, you know, 12th notes, so it's kind of, you know, third mix down.

20:32.120 --> 20:38.440
It's basically DDR first mix type level. I mean, the simulator hasn't quite progressed,

20:38.440 --> 20:43.080
you know, obviously, to that level of being on the same caliber as DDR Max. It's an early

20:43.080 --> 20:47.260
beta release. They're not done with everything they wanted to do yet. So it's an early beta

20:47.260 --> 20:50.360
that got released, but you can download this. It's got about, what, seven songs on it that

20:50.360 --> 20:55.340
you can play, all by the same guy, I notice, but that'll probably change with future versions.

20:55.340 --> 20:57.960
There's some decent stuff in there. I'm going to play one of the songs from PETA Fury a

20:57.960 --> 21:04.920
little later. So some good stuff. It's just like Dance Magic, as you said. It's kind of

21:04.920 --> 21:08.640
like Street Fighter meets DDR, if you can imagine that, because you've got your characters

21:08.640 --> 21:12.120
that you pick and all this stuff. But I know everybody got a chance to test it for the

21:12.120 --> 21:15.920
show. I was just kind of wondering what you guys thought. I'll start. I know it's an early

21:15.920 --> 21:20.320
beta. I think it's an early beta. It's damn impressive. I mean, it's kind of like what

21:20.320 --> 21:25.800
I'd call a DDR-first mix. As far as DDR goes, it's got a long way to go to catch up. But

21:25.800 --> 21:28.520
I mean, it's still a first release, it's early, but it looks good.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.520
I mean, a lot of Dreamcast's homebrew and stuff isn't that great, but Feed of Fury is

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
coming along very nicely.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.400
I love the idea that it's going to support your own stuff, your own DWIs and things.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.860
I kind of wish there was a mode that wasn't Dance Magic, like you could play in like a

21:40.860 --> 21:44.800
normal mode, but I kind of think that all that stuff is coming.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.080
They just want to get the initial stuff out the gate and then they'll kind of add on to

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
it.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.200
All that freeze arrows and 12th notes, they'll probably come onto it later, but they've got

21:51.200 --> 21:52.760
to get their basic engine established first.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.760
They're smart.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.760
Yeah.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
Yeah, if they're smart they'll do that.

21:55.760 --> 21:59.480
But I think if you got a Dreamcast and a Burner, there's no reason you shouldn't be going and

21:59.480 --> 22:00.760
downloading this right now and playing it.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.760
It's pretty cool.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
Hold on.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
Yes, Brad?

22:03.760 --> 22:12.480
Okay, I understand it's a beta and all, and I guess this is a great start, there's some

22:12.480 --> 22:17.560
possibilities and things with this, but who was the graphic designer on this thing, man?

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
I have no idea.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.440
Some big Star Trek geek or something?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.680
Because what are the arrows?

22:21.680 --> 22:23.720
The arrows are the shape of...

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
Are they?

22:24.720 --> 22:27.720
Is the arrow the shape of the normal arrows in DDR?

22:27.720 --> 22:32.720
Well, that's the thing, is that you don't want to copy DDR because they're probably afraid of a lawsuit.

22:32.720 --> 22:40.720
Well, you know what, though? That if you ever played True Kiss Destination DDR, those arrows look a hell of a lot like those arrows. I kind of noticed that.

22:40.720 --> 22:45.600
Well, on the topic of those arrows, you know, it's nice to have different arrows, but you

22:45.600 --> 22:48.360
can't tell the difference between, you know, the different notes.

22:48.360 --> 22:53.920
Like fourth notes, you know, eighth, sixteenth, it's, I mean, they have a slight color change

22:53.920 --> 22:57.240
to them, but otherwise they're just looking like these shiny Star Trek symbols.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
Yeah.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.600
Why don't we just make them big circles, all of them?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
They can all be circles.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
There you go.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.600
And hopefully you tell them apart, they're different colors.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.800
That would be easy to answer, so we can't do that.

23:06.800 --> 23:13.800
No, but I think that as far as it goes, the actual playing quality, it's not that bad,

23:13.800 --> 23:20.200
but the arrows, it's really weird, because one of the modifiers especially makes all

23:20.200 --> 23:26.880
the arrows spin around in place, kind of like, I forget what it is on StepMania, do you know

23:26.880 --> 23:27.880
what the...

23:27.880 --> 23:28.880
Dizzy.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.600
Dizzy mode, where all of them spin around while going up, even though they're in the

23:31.600 --> 23:33.280
same column.

23:33.280 --> 23:39.880
And with arrows that long, they kind of overlap, so you can't tell which note is which and

23:39.880 --> 23:40.880
which...

23:40.880 --> 23:42.440
Well, right, but I mean, it's not supposed to be easy.

23:42.440 --> 23:47.680
Yeah, but it's not supposed to be impossible to read.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.080
And also another thing I noticed is it's way too easy to get perfect.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.240
That blink thing was the most annoying one, where like half the arrows would disappear

23:55.240 --> 23:58.600
at a time, they'd fade in and out, you'd be able to see half of them, that was really

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
hard to see.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.460
I didn't quite get how the gameplay of the game went. Of course, maybe that's my own

24:03.460 --> 24:07.360
fault because I didn't read a manual, but hopefully they'll do a built-in tutorial later

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
on in the game.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.520
Yeah, I don't think there's any story mode or anything. I mean, it didn't look like...

24:11.520 --> 24:16.400
Well, I don't know. Like, they're having Puzzle Tetris or whatever it's called.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Puzzle Fighter?

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
No.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400
God.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
What's a game?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
God, shit.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
Puzzle Bobble?

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
No, it's on Super Nintendo.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
Bust a move?

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
Final Fantasy?

24:25.400 --> 24:26.400
No.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.400
Oh, God.

24:27.400 --> 24:41.400
Oh god, my mouth plays a ton.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
First Avalanche?

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
No, it might hurt.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
No, I don't think...

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
You like Yoshi, Tetris, or Yoshi?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.400
Ah, Yoshi's in heat?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
No, dammit!

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
What is it?

24:49.400 --> 24:50.400
Forget it!

24:50.400 --> 24:51.400
Who cares?

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
Dammit!

24:52.400 --> 24:56.400
So basically you pick a character and they have different modifiers that they attack with or whatever.

24:56.400 --> 25:01.400
So as you're going along you have a little bar that's kind of in the middle and as soon as that builds up you can do one of two things.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.400
Either you can set to auto where once it builds up all the way along you can unleash the attack.

25:06.400 --> 25:13.400
Or you can set to manual to where when it builds up you can attack whenever with a modifier or something.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.400
That's nice. What I like to do during that is just punch my neighbor, whoever's playing against me.

25:17.400 --> 25:24.320
I when it when it fills up or not whenever just whenever I feel like it that works. It's more effective. I

25:27.960 --> 25:31.600
Don't think they could hear you on the way it's it's for the best that they couldn't hear me

25:32.400 --> 25:34.400
So yeah, that's pretty much what it is

25:35.920 --> 25:37.640
Tetris attack

25:37.640 --> 25:39.120
Yes

25:39.120 --> 25:43.960
How'd that feel when I smashed the ichophone against your hand? You know, I said Tetris attack earlier

25:43.960 --> 25:50.960
Or the uber awesome, and I'm sorry. Fuck all y'all, this game rules. Pokemon Puzzle League.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Boo!

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
Fuck you!

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Oh, you mean Yoshi's Cookie?

25:53.960 --> 25:58.460
No! I mean Pokemon Puzzle League. It was never released on Super Nintendo. It doesn't

25:58.460 --> 26:00.960
exist. It was always Pokemon. I swear.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.960
Yoshi's Cookie.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
Yoshi's Cookie.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.960
So yeah, that's about it. That's all. I guess we'll have to wait a couple months and see

26:06.960 --> 26:09.960
what they're going to come up with. Supposedly there's supposed to be a step editor and stuff.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
I haven't exactly tried to, uh...

26:12.960 --> 26:14.960
What the hell are you doing?

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
We're, um...

26:16.960 --> 26:18.960
No, we're doing Kentucky Fried Movie.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
Anyways...

26:19.960 --> 26:21.960
For all our listeners, you can't see.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.960
So, um...

26:23.960 --> 26:25.960
Yeah, they're supposed to add a step editor.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.960
And I haven't tried to, actually, you know, make a swap CD,

26:27.960 --> 26:29.960
but you can do that too, and...

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
I don't know.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.960
I'm being told a few things by Twen in the chat room,

26:32.960 --> 26:36.960
who was our, kind of, the person who alerted us to, uh...

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
this game in the first place,

26:37.960 --> 26:41.960
saying that the creator has stated that a main mode will be in the final version

26:41.960 --> 26:45.960
cool, that's good to hear, and not only will you be able to put in your own

26:45.960 --> 26:49.960
DWIs and stuff, you'll be able to have your own graphic themes, so if you want to change the arrows

26:49.960 --> 26:53.960
have, go to town. I wasn't waving, I was going like

26:53.960 --> 26:57.960
way, yay, wow. I thought you were waving because you wanted to talk, I'm sorry.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.960
But anyways.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.960
What other kinds of modes would you be looking forward to, to see in a later version of

27:05.960 --> 27:09.960
I don't really know. That just means I have to buy Dreamcast pads now.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.960
Screw that, I'm just sticking with my PC.

27:11.960 --> 27:20.960
Actually, what I was planning to do since I'm, you know, like that, I was going to rip the songs out of that sim and put them on my sim, but you know, that's just me.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.960
Did you say rip?

27:22.960 --> 27:23.960
Yeah, I said rip.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.840
red

27:27.840 --> 27:30.720
yet to go ahead and play one of those songs and peter fury real fast from

27:30.720 --> 27:33.820

want to hear the uh...

27:35.100 --> 27:38.220
music that goes into it and this is uh... created by guy who did all the

27:38.220 --> 27:40.220
songs in the first release of peter fear by the way

27:40.220 --> 27:41.760

27:52.300 --> 27:54.260
This happens to be my favorite song in the game.

This is Thyssenitis, and I'm going to play this for you guys so you can sample some of

27:58.380 --> 28:05.380
music from Feed a Fury right here on Orange Lounge Radio.

know what the official label of it would be but dance magic type things you guys

30:47.700 --> 30:52.300
some very interesting comments were made during that a song in the room here

30:52.300 --> 30:55.340
basically talking how much of an old-school video game that sounds like

30:55.340 --> 30:59.980
is like level four of blaster master or something

30:59.980 --> 31:03.140
in defense of blaster master it had better music than that

31:03.140 --> 31:04.780
blaster master is a shit

31:04.780 --> 31:06.660
irene i know you had some pretty uh...

31:06.660 --> 31:13.220
some pretty interesting opinions so why don't you share with everyone else listening

31:13.220 --> 31:15.340
oh man

31:15.340 --> 31:16.760
my plumbing was clogged

31:16.760 --> 31:17.380
anyway

31:17.380 --> 31:18.720
uh... hold on

31:18.720 --> 31:23.580
brad is the most immature person i know

31:23.580 --> 31:28.340
and he's like four years older than you are.

31:28.340 --> 31:29.020
Oh, um...

31:29.020 --> 31:31.580
V to Fury, is that what it's called? Yes, V to Fury.

31:31.580 --> 31:36.620
Why do you think it sucks? It's free! I don't care! But the best things in life are free! Yeah, well if you already have

31:36.620 --> 31:40.660
like third mix, fourth mix, whatever on PlayStation, that's free.

31:40.660 --> 31:44.620
You know, I mean, this is, it's already been done on Disney's Rave, and I think it's just kind of

31:44.620 --> 31:47.940
cheesy, and like the music doesn't fit well, it doesn't dance.

31:47.940 --> 31:53.380
I mean, I couldn't dance to it, and if I saw it, just, you know, I wouldn't want to, you know, get it or anything.

31:53.380 --> 32:00.380
Now, do you think if Loki performed some sexual favors over there and got some of his songs on the F.O.F., it might be a little better?

32:00.380 --> 32:04.380
It might be a little better, but I still wouldn't play it.

32:04.380 --> 32:11.380
I mean, I don't know, like, you know, not because of his music, but because the whole scheme of it just sucks.

32:11.380 --> 32:18.380
I don't know, like, if he were to put his music, like, on a, you know, a max scheme or something like that, or Disney's Rave, yeah, sure, I'd play it.

32:18.380 --> 32:21.380
So you just want to play a copy of DDR, basically, with new songs?

32:21.380 --> 32:25.180
Well, not even just a copy, just DDR.

32:25.180 --> 32:28.700
If you're going to even call this a knockoff of DDR, it's not very well done.

32:28.700 --> 32:29.700
I don't know.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.500
Even if it is preliminary, it kind of sucks.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.500
I don't like it.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
Fair enough.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.180
You can't please everybody.

32:36.180 --> 32:37.180
That's fine.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.980
We're about a variety of opinion here on Orange Launch Radio.

32:39.980 --> 32:40.980
You suck, Irene.

32:40.980 --> 32:41.980
I hate you.

32:41.980 --> 32:44.420
You can never please women.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.420
That's right.

32:45.420 --> 32:46.420
You can never please a woman like you.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.420
No, you can't.

32:47.420 --> 32:48.860
It's okay.

32:48.860 --> 32:49.860
I don't need to.

32:49.860 --> 32:53.860
You know, this Fetus Fury game needs to have, like, a one panel mode.

32:53.860 --> 32:54.860
That'd be cool.

32:54.860 --> 32:55.860
A one panel mode?

32:55.860 --> 32:56.860
Yeah!

32:56.860 --> 32:57.860
Yeah!

32:57.860 --> 32:58.860
That'd be hard.

32:58.860 --> 32:59.860
I couldn't do it.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.860
Too many arrows.

33:01.860 --> 33:05.860
No, I think two panel would be better, because it's, like, just running.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.860
It's like Dropout.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.860
Oh, I should just play Boom Boom Dollar.

33:09.860 --> 33:10.860
That was over.

33:10.860 --> 33:11.860
Left, left, right, right, left, right, right.

33:11.860 --> 33:12.860
Uh, well, let's see.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.940
Let's just play, um, let's see, Mickey Mouse March from Disney's Rift.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.860
That is left and right.

33:18.860 --> 33:23.060
No. I don't know. I still, I still, I like

33:23.060 --> 33:26.300
PETA FURIA. I mean, it's not something I'm gonna play every day. It's just kind of

33:26.300 --> 33:27.640
something you look at and go,

33:27.640 --> 33:31.900
yeah, it's pretty cool. I wonder what the next one's gonna look like, and... You can look at that.

33:31.900 --> 33:35.620
Not me, because I'm not gonna play it. Well, you're a bitch.

33:35.620 --> 33:40.300
I'm just kidding. Fuck you! You're gonna die.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.740
You know I speak the truth. It's all good.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.900
It's all good. You speak the truth, you're a bitch. Oh, thanks.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.100
I love you, Eileen. You know that.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.500
Ow! Now her bar got full and she punched me.

33:53.500 --> 34:00.500
Wow.

34:01.340 --> 34:05.500
I suggest we're gonna take a quick break, because I need to go to potty and I've got

34:05.500 --> 34:06.780
people yelling at me left

34:06.780 --> 34:11.180
left and right to play the channel. Are you guys destroying things back there? What the

34:11.180 --> 34:11.900
hell's going on?

34:11.900 --> 34:15.340
Dave had a little too much to drink, so he's... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.

34:15.340 --> 34:18.340
Didn't you have a birthday recently, Dave, or am I confusing you with someone else?

34:18.340 --> 34:19.340
Who are you talking to, Rob?

34:19.340 --> 34:20.340
Did Dave leave?

34:20.340 --> 34:21.340
Yes.

34:21.340 --> 34:22.340
Oh, never mind.

34:22.340 --> 34:25.340
That's why you have to look at the computer screen all the time.

34:25.340 --> 34:29.340
Get out of your house, Rob.

34:29.340 --> 34:32.340
Get off your tail and go.

34:32.340 --> 34:33.340
Great.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.340
Okay, I'm going to put on some songs.

34:35.340 --> 34:39.340
We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be right back and we're going to talk about

34:39.340 --> 34:44.340
Dance Dance Revolution USA and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

34:44.340 --> 34:48.340
So we'll be right back. You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

36:44.340 --> 36:48.340

41:44.600 --> 41:49.080
a friendly public service announcement from orange lounge radio

41:49.080 --> 41:51.920

42:11.800 --> 42:14.300
I can barely hear, I'm sorry. I'm in a restaurant.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.300
Oh, okay. Um...

42:15.300 --> 42:16.800
We got hungry.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.800
Well, what's going on? Tell...

42:17.800 --> 42:20.300
I'm sorry, listeners, but I needed food.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.300
That's okay. You want to say anything to our listeners?

42:23.300 --> 42:24.300
What?

42:24.300 --> 42:27.300
Do you want to say anything to our listeners?

42:27.300 --> 42:30.300
I just wanted to make sure everything was going okay.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.300
Everything's going great.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.300
You're cutting up on me.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.300
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You want to say anything?

42:36.300 --> 42:39.800
We've been talking about Feed a Fury. Have you played that yet?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.300
I still can't hear you.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.300
We've been talking about Feet of Fury, have you played that yet?

42:45.300 --> 42:47.300
It's freaking up, I'm sorry, why don't I talk to you in a bit?

42:48.300 --> 42:49.300
Alright, I'll talk to you later, Jamie.

42:50.300 --> 42:51.300
Bye.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.300
Now you know why we can't take phone calls on this show.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.300
Well, we need to patch it in an actual phone line.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.300
Yeah, we need to patch it in an actual phone line.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.300
And at some point we'll be able to take phone calls.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.300
But that was my cell phone on the speakerphone.

43:04.300 --> 43:09.300
And she couldn't hear me because I guess we get really shitty reception in this room here.

43:09.300 --> 43:14.460
room here, so. Uh, Irene, you were telling a funny little story during the break, you

43:14.460 --> 43:17.460
know what I'm talking about? I don't know what I'm talking about, man.

43:17.460 --> 43:20.460
It's something for, it's orange on business. Oh, it's orange on old business.

43:20.460 --> 43:25.820
See, and you were listening, but that's okay. That's fine.

43:25.820 --> 43:29.620
I didn't think so, actually. Okay, so unfortunately it sounds like Jamie

43:29.620 --> 43:32.020
and them stopped to eat, so I don't think there's any way in hell she's gonna make it

43:32.020 --> 43:35.180
back in time, so. Maybe they're out dairy green running across

43:35.180 --> 43:37.860
the street. Yeah, wouldn't that be funny? Why don't you

43:37.860 --> 43:40.700
Tell her one where I live, Brad.

43:40.700 --> 43:43.540
I'm sure he's in a thousand or a million fucking Dairy Queens.

43:43.540 --> 43:45.820
Well, in Sacramento, there's only like, you know...

43:45.820 --> 43:46.580
Fifty.

43:46.580 --> 43:51.140
Just kidding, I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you, I don't care.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.180
Yeah, so, Feed a Fury.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.460
Any last thoughts on that?

43:54.460 --> 43:58.060
I know you guys were saying some more during the break. No.

43:58.060 --> 44:01.460
Just a quick reminder, if you are going to burn it, make sure you have the

44:01.460 --> 44:02.540
newest copy of

44:02.540 --> 44:04.180
Nero or whatever, the

44:04.180 --> 44:06.520
burning software, because I burned one

44:06.520 --> 44:10.920
with an older copy of Nero. I mean, not that old, but a little older, and it didn't work.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.600
So, make sure you have the newest version of Nero.

44:14.600 --> 44:17.960
From what I understand, they did release the next day. They released an updated version

44:17.960 --> 44:20.600
of the burn that should work on older version Nero, because I have an old version of Nero

44:20.600 --> 44:22.760
and I was able to get it with their re-released one, so.

44:22.760 --> 44:27.240
Those bastards. They made me lose a CD.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.520
Me too. I lost two of them. But if you want to check it out, form your own opinion on

44:30.520 --> 44:35.800
the game, kind of got a mixed reaction here so far, check it out at http colon slash slash

44:35.800 --> 44:40.400
www.cagames.com

44:40.400 --> 44:42.440
So moving right along, I should plug our chat room.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.020
We haven't plugged that at all tonight.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.860
You're just going to join any other side IRC server,

44:46.860 --> 44:51.580
like karma.othersideirc.net or irc.eggheads.org.

44:51.580 --> 44:54.680
And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.680
And that's the same server, by the way,

44:56.680 --> 44:58.680
that hosts a lot of the other big Bimani sites.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.460
So if you're in one of the Bimani chat rooms right now,

45:01.460 --> 45:03.760
chances are you're on the same server as Orange Lounge.

45:03.760 --> 45:09.960
Just type to join the channel orange lounge Brad waiting your clothes off. We're not ready for that point of the show yet

45:15.560 --> 45:16.920
Anyway

45:16.920 --> 45:20.120
Let's talk about I don't know. Let's talk about

45:20.880 --> 45:23.920
How'd you guys week? It's been about two weeks since we've all been kind of sitting here together

45:23.920 --> 45:26.120
How'd you guys week you do anything exciting any?

45:27.080 --> 45:29.160
Bahmani news or novel on he is I don't care

45:30.160 --> 45:31.440
I

45:31.440 --> 45:33.400
I finished my site.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.360
Oh yeah, tell everybody about your site.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.280
Yes, yes, yes, my DDR site.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.600
Thanks to Twin for registering a domain name

45:41.600 --> 45:44.520
that kind of got me started on actually finishing my site.

45:44.520 --> 45:48.760
It's LeechFromLoki.tk.

45:48.760 --> 45:51.480
That's right, LeechFromLoki.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.080
And it's got a pretty cool interface.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.520
All that's up there right now is just two of my originals.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.060
I've got one for Fire in the Dark

45:58.060 --> 46:00.520
and one for the Quake 2 theme.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.120
it's kind of like some hard rock kind of stuff, I guess.

46:03.120 --> 46:03.960
And then...

46:03.960 --> 46:05.360
I like the layout of the site, by the way.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.840
You got that Never Look Back thing going on.

46:06.840 --> 46:07.680
It's pretty cool.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.480
Yeah, I have the Never Look Back G2 Arts thing

46:10.480 --> 46:12.000
as kind of my background there,

46:12.000 --> 46:13.560
and it's a pretty strange interface.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.720
It's kind of cool.

46:14.720 --> 46:18.520
And so I have tons of web space.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.640
I've got like 50 megs for stuff right now,

46:20.640 --> 46:22.920
and they didn't really say in this claimer

46:22.920 --> 46:24.640
that I couldn't have more than one site.

46:24.640 --> 46:27.760
So I guess really I have unlimited web space

46:27.760 --> 46:29.760
and unlimited bandwidth, so that's kind of cool.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.960
maybe later on forms will be coming up because I also have the capability to do

46:33.960 --> 46:40.320
that and so yeah it'll be fun we need orange lounge forms so you might have to

46:40.320 --> 46:44.600
work that in for us I could do that yeah all right good deal good deal can I give

46:44.600 --> 46:49.280
an update on my site yes it's 20 20

46:49.280 --> 46:58.280
Oh, God, you suck. Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.280
You're going to attack her or attack me first, because I am my joke.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.280
Brad, you suck. Thank you.

47:03.280 --> 47:08.280
Okay, now you can attack her.

47:08.280 --> 47:15.280
Oh, dear God. By the way, for those that have been bitching about how bad the Orange Lounge site has been looking, because it's really old,

47:15.280 --> 47:22.280
SoCalKicks, by the way, one of our early listeners, being one of those people that always bitched about how bad it looked, I said, fine, SoCalKicks, you do a new site.

47:22.280 --> 47:29.280
So he said, okay. So, he's supposed to be working on that for us, so we'll have a new site soon. That's all I can tell you.

47:29.280 --> 47:40.280
Let's see. Let's talk about Max USA. DDR Max USA. What?

47:40.280 --> 47:41.280
Yeah, it's Max USA.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.280
Oh, you mean the one that's off by a measure?

47:43.280 --> 47:49.480
Well, no, no, no. It's actually okay. Last time we were here in the room talking, they

47:49.480 --> 47:53.360
had released the demo on the official PlayStation Magazine, and two of the songs were off by

47:53.360 --> 47:58.560
complete measure. However, from what I understand, they released a new demo to GameStops across

47:58.560 --> 48:04.880
America. I believe Jamie said she has one, because her fiancé is a manager of a GameStop.

48:04.880 --> 48:08.140
She has one of those demo discs, and from what I understand, it's fixed. They did fix

48:08.140 --> 48:15.940
those measures they're right on yeah I don't I don't know if um I don't know

48:15.940 --> 48:19.420
if there were any new songs in that demo now I know when they went in and hacked

48:19.420 --> 48:23.300
the song list like they did last time that they found what's kind of assumed

48:23.300 --> 48:27.860
to be a pretty damn close to the actual list going on I don't know if you want

48:27.860 --> 48:30.340
to elaborate on that okay because you look at more of that stuff than I do

48:30.340 --> 48:34.300
what what they did is they kind of got another list it's pretty similar to the

48:34.300 --> 48:36.860
last one a lot of things people were saying before is there's not gonna be

48:36.860 --> 48:41.300
ghosts there's not gonna be cockamay you guys are wrong so on this list there

48:41.300 --> 48:45.700
isn't ghosts or cockamay because it's more of an update which is kind of

48:45.700 --> 48:49.900
strange because you think well gee you know this list got leaked up before it

48:49.900 --> 48:54.060
let's not put it in when we fix the demo this time oh well you know what I bet

48:54.060 --> 48:57.700
though because those that demo only came out about what a week after the the list

48:57.700 --> 49:01.540
was leaked right but they probably have to do those demos to get them burned and

49:01.540 --> 49:08.540
mass and everything. That demo was probably done about six weeks ago.

49:31.540 --> 49:33.540
alphabetical order from the rest. It was kind of weird.

49:33.540 --> 49:37.540
Yeah, but the list wasn't alphabetical in the first place. The guy put him in alphabetical order.

49:37.540 --> 49:39.540
Oh, I didn't realize that. I'm sorry.

49:39.540 --> 49:41.540
So that has nothing to do with it.

49:41.540 --> 49:43.540
It's still kind of weird.

49:43.540 --> 49:49.540
When I saw When a Man Loves a Woman on there, I was like, that cannot be in the game. Come on.

49:49.540 --> 49:58.540
Yeah, but what about Be in My Paradise? I'm just kidding. Be in My Paradise isn't in there either, I don't think. Was it?

49:58.540 --> 50:01.460
anyways you have you've ever been all day the possible mission on Commodore

50:01.460 --> 50:05.300
sixty-four the city so like right now pretty far the attack

50:05.300 --> 50:08.300
uh...

50:08.300 --> 50:09.300
they are

50:09.300 --> 50:10.680
they forever

50:10.680 --> 50:12.600
in my room

50:12.600 --> 50:13.600
anyway yes

50:13.600 --> 50:15.300
anyways high world

50:15.300 --> 50:17.060
uh...

50:17.060 --> 50:18.860
so anyways uh...

50:18.860 --> 50:21.180
some of these there were on there though like

50:21.180 --> 50:25.540
that he mentioned that were also in uh... this is very mixed was uh...

50:25.540 --> 50:27.000
the bad touch

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
which I don't know.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.440
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals.

50:30.440 --> 50:31.640
I don't think so.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
Okay.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.580
Just stay with me for a second here.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.960
I have my own theory as to why that's inaccurate, but you can tell your theory and I'll tell

50:37.960 --> 50:38.960
mine.

50:38.960 --> 50:39.960
Okay.

50:39.960 --> 50:40.960
Here's my theory.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.920
Now, this is possible that when they were doing the licensing for, you know, Dancing

50:42.920 --> 50:46.720
Stage, you know, Party Mix, where they could have done it like where they were going to

50:46.720 --> 50:49.800
put it in this game and that game, which, you know, that can make sense.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.200
Now, I don't know if...

50:51.200 --> 50:55.920
Now, I do understand that Dancing Stage Party Mix is for the PlayStation PS1.

50:55.920 --> 50:56.920
Right.

50:56.920 --> 51:03.080
I don't know how that could be carried over to the PS2 list, that wouldn't make any sense.

51:03.080 --> 51:07.440
I could understand if, like, Gnomics had that stuff in there or something like that, and

51:07.440 --> 51:11.720
that didn't end up being in there because they were making, you know, Densey Stage party

51:11.720 --> 51:15.940
mix at the same time, they could be working on the engine at the same time.

51:15.940 --> 51:20.100
My theory as to why they're not in there is in that box art that was released about four

51:20.100 --> 51:24.880
weeks ago, because if, you know, one of those songs also on that list is Kylie Minogue,

51:24.880 --> 51:25.880
Can't Get You Outta My Head.

51:25.880 --> 51:30.040
Now, if that were actually in the game, I would think that would be the first name that

51:30.040 --> 51:35.220
would be on that cover, because she's a multi-platinum selling worldwide artist.

51:35.220 --> 51:37.600
Certainly more well-known than Darude, I would think.

51:37.600 --> 51:40.300
I think her name would have been on there at the top billing, so I don't think that

51:40.300 --> 51:43.000
song's in there, and I think it kind of voids out all the Euromix ones.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.400
But that's just my theory.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.400
I could be wrong.

51:45.400 --> 51:46.400
But I don't think I am.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
Who knows?

51:47.400 --> 51:48.400
Maybe.

51:48.400 --> 51:53.600
Maybe it could be a hidden thing, but I would think if I were Konami and I had to have spent

51:53.600 --> 51:56.820
lots of money to get a Kylie Minogue song in my game

51:56.820 --> 51:58.400
I would make it a hidden song

51:58.400 --> 52:01.280
I'd make it a selling point so

52:01.280 --> 52:02.520
and don't you think

52:02.520 --> 52:06.840
the representatives of Kylie Minogue would want you to put that kind of a thing on the cover

52:06.840 --> 52:10.800
saying oh featuring Kylie Minogue blah blah blah

52:10.800 --> 52:16.340
featuring Kylie Minogue's breasts

52:16.340 --> 52:19.400
well I'm sorry oh yes you have this interesting theory on Kylie Minogue's teeth don't you?

52:19.400 --> 52:21.480
was that you or was that someone else?

52:21.480 --> 52:22.960
well they're big

52:22.960 --> 52:25.880
They bite.

52:25.880 --> 52:30.160
Hey, big and white, kind of like Brad.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.320
How would you know?

52:31.320 --> 52:31.960
Wait, let's not go there.

52:31.960 --> 52:33.160
You're standing right in front of me.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.520
Oh, I didn't mean that.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.640
God, no.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.880
So, I was walking down the street.

52:39.880 --> 52:41.200
And?

52:41.200 --> 52:43.080
NDDR Max USA?

52:43.080 --> 52:44.840
NDDR Max USA, yeah.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.600
You know what, honestly, I have a confession to make, guys.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.660
What?

52:48.660 --> 52:50.520
I haven't.

52:50.520 --> 52:51.640
Don't worry, sweetie.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.160
It's not what you think.

52:53.160 --> 52:54.320
No, um...

52:54.320 --> 52:57.560
I haven't played DDR in over a week.

52:57.560 --> 52:58.840
Yeah, yeah.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.680
Play a GASP! Wave file.

53:00.680 --> 53:03.560
You have one? No? Okay.

53:03.560 --> 53:06.160
Hey, Rob, get your head out of your ass to see if there's any tension.

53:06.160 --> 53:11.200
Sorry, I'm being given some information. I have to see if I can give it out or not.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.480
What were you saying?

53:12.480 --> 53:15.400
I can't say it because I don't know if I can give it out or not!

53:15.400 --> 53:16.580
No, I can't. I can.

53:16.580 --> 53:17.580
Basically,

53:17.580 --> 53:20.360
being told, okay, so maybe I'm wrong then with this news.

53:20.360 --> 53:22.900
they're saying the box art is outdated

53:22.900 --> 53:26.380
the yellow burst on the cover isn't really there it was just there for the

53:26.380 --> 53:29.600
online version it's not on the real box art

53:29.600 --> 53:31.500
so

53:31.500 --> 53:33.500
okay so maybe they changed it

53:33.500 --> 53:34.680
but i still don't think they're there

53:34.680 --> 53:40.980
i still don't think they're there. Even more important than all that? I haven't played DDR in a week.

53:40.980 --> 53:45.580
Oh yeah? Well I haven't played DDR since yesterday at home. All I gotta say is I don't care

53:45.580 --> 53:48.460
I have it reserved it's coming out next Tuesday

53:48.460 --> 53:55.460
i don't give a shit. I think at this point none of us really give a shit what's on it, just release the damn thing already so we can play it.

53:55.460 --> 53:58.460
I'd rather be surprised, you know? I already pre-ordered it too.

53:58.460 --> 54:05.460
So, well, is there a real dilemma here? What? That comes out the same day Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out.

54:05.460 --> 54:11.460
I'm like, shit! I can't play both! I'm just gonna take the whole week off.

54:11.460 --> 54:18.460
Maybe they should make a version where it's all DDR music in the radio of Grand Theft Auto, because you know they've got the radio.

54:18.460 --> 54:20.460
Uh, no. Anyways.

54:20.460 --> 54:28.460
Watch, watch. I bet you anything, the exact same day those two games come out is the day we finally get 2DX in Sacramento, I bet you anything.

54:28.460 --> 54:30.460
It's all going to happen the same day.

54:30.460 --> 54:35.460
I know me and probably a bunch of other people will be ripping all those songs and set files to play them.

54:35.460 --> 54:40.460
DDR Max, oh my god, you're going to blow your load!

54:40.460 --> 54:43.460
Sorry, that's an inside room joke. Sorry, you guys.

54:43.460 --> 54:48.460
Yeah, anyways, you'll probably see the sim files out the same week, guaranteed.

54:48.460 --> 54:49.460
For what? The new stuff?

54:49.460 --> 54:50.460
Oh, yeah.

54:50.460 --> 54:52.460
Oh, yeah. You guys are crazy. You have those sim files around.

54:52.460 --> 54:55.460
I remember that they were already trying to find AeroCharts.

54:55.460 --> 54:57.460
We'll talk about Xtreme a little later in the show,

54:57.460 --> 55:00.460
but they were already trying to find the AeroCharts for Xtreme.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.460
I'm watching that one Japanese site that's got the Max 2 stuff,

55:02.460 --> 55:06.460
because they're the first ones that have the Max 2 AeroCharts, and I'm waiting.

55:06.460 --> 55:07.460
Just waiting.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.460
I'm just waiting.

55:08.460 --> 55:15.180
Alright, I actually want to play for you an MP3 of one of the new DDR Maxx USA songs.

55:15.180 --> 55:19.580
I'm just going to play one for you guys, we're going to play Just Leave Me Alone.

55:19.580 --> 55:24.700
This is by a group, I believe they're called Venus, and this MP3 is coming from, no, it's

55:24.700 --> 55:30.020
not Michael Jackson, I'm sorry, yes, this is coming from SoCalKicks.com, and he actually

55:30.020 --> 55:34.740
has a bunch of MP3s of songs that are going to be on DDR Maxx USA, so if you like this,

55:34.740 --> 55:38.340
you want to hear the rest of them, go visit his site, SoCalKicks.com, and he'll appreciate

55:38.340 --> 55:43.800
I'm plugging the hell out of them right there.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.200
You guys are so wrong.

55:46.200 --> 55:47.200
I hate you.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.720
What were you doing last night, Rob, when I tried to call?

55:49.720 --> 55:54.640
I just want you to wait for the all caps line yelling at you guys right here in about two

55:54.640 --> 55:55.640
seconds.

55:55.640 --> 55:56.640
Anyway.

55:56.640 --> 55:58.060
Oh, not all caps.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.060
That's such rude.

55:59.060 --> 56:02.520
Or maybe you'll do that AZN type of typing.

56:02.520 --> 56:06.860
Anyway, if you like this MP3 you can go over to that site and get the rest of them.

56:06.860 --> 56:10.460
It's not the actual edit that's going to be in DDR.

56:10.460 --> 56:14.540
It is edited down to a minute and a half, about, and from what I'm told, it's not the

56:14.540 --> 56:18.180
actual one, but it's kind of close, whatever that means.

56:18.180 --> 56:20.920
So take it or leave it, here it is.

56:20.920 --> 56:27.100
This is, sometimes I wish we were a TV show and the rest of you don't.

56:27.100 --> 56:34.100
I'm going to play from DDR Max USA, this is Venus with Just Leave Me Alone.

56:57.100 --> 57:07.100
There's no need to sit deep inside my heart, inside my soul

57:07.100 --> 57:34.100
Why? You leave me alone, don't tell me why. There ain't no need to carry on. You leave me alone if I'm not right.

57:34.100 --> 57:39.100
And why do you leave me alone so many days?

57:39.100 --> 57:42.100
You're thinking of you so many nights

57:42.100 --> 57:47.100
You leave me alone when it comes to time

57:47.100 --> 57:49.100
Tell me why

57:55.100 --> 57:56.100
Tell me why

57:56.100 --> 58:26.060
Alright, you heard it here first.

58:26.060 --> 58:29.140
or you heard it here second if you are already a so-called Texas site

58:29.140 --> 58:34.240
that was Venus with Jay you just leave me alone and that's gonna be

58:34.240 --> 58:37.780
and Brad you should take that advice just leave me alone you fucking bastard

58:37.780 --> 58:40.860

59:22.280 --> 59:24.280
What the hell were you saying while that song was playing?

59:24.280 --> 59:26.280
It was more Kentucky Fried Movie.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.280
Oh, sorry. Okay.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.280
Big Jim Slade.

59:30.280 --> 59:32.280
Anyway, no, but it's better than the Fetus Fury songs.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.280
That one was true.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.280
Alright, fair enough.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.280
I like Dark Black Forest better.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.280
I think that song kicks so much ass that

59:40.280 --> 59:42.280
Dark Black Forest is going to be in DDR, but

59:42.280 --> 59:44.280
that's pretty good, it ain't so bad.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.280
So if you like that, go over to

59:46.280 --> 59:48.280
SoCalKicks.com and there's more and

59:48.280 --> 59:50.280
maybe we'll be adding some of those to the

59:50.280 --> 59:54.400
launch playlist. However, I'm kind of holding out to get the actual rips from the actual

59:54.400 --> 59:58.200
game, which I'm sure will be out no less than 30 minutes after the game hits shelves, if

59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.560
not sooner. So we'll see. Damn right. Can we do a list list tonight? What do you want

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:11.120
to do a list list for? I don't know. Let's do a list list for something not even related

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.440
to DDR. You guys think about it. We'll see. If we got time, we'll do one. We haven't done

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.440
anything. We haven't done the FUs of the weekend. I know. We're still going. Keep going.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440
What time is it?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.440
It's 8.02, we're halfway there.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.440
You guys want to do F-use the Wii? I don't have anything else to add on Max USA.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.440
I don't really have any important evidence.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.440
There's really no other news on Max USA for me to report other than it's almost here.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.440
It's the extreme!

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.440
We'll do extreme after the next break, because there's a lot to say on that.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.440
All I have to say is, Naoki is such a chick.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.440
Is such a chick.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.440
I'm sorry.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.440
If anyone's recording the show, I want that sound clip.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.440
He can't look any more like a woman than he does now.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.240
What, is the sex change coming next?

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.800
I mean, that one picture that we have of him

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.920
in the New Naoki Journal where he's at the test location,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.400
they show a back shot of him.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.840
His hair is like really long.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.760
He's wearing this like dress suit thing

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.760
that looks like a woman's...

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.800
I don't even know what it is.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.160
It's just, he looks like a chick.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:08.980
It's sad.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.840
Well, next they're gonna have him in the schoolgirl outfit,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.760
so don't worry.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760
Then we'll know.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760
Bishonen.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.000
He's not even Bishonen, though, honestly.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.400
I do not think he's...

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.740
I mean, I'm not gay or anything, man.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:27.680
I think Depeche was a pretty sweet band, but I'm just kidding.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.840
Okay, somebody in the hallway just said, I don't know if there's anything wrong with

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
that.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.400
Wow, it's an audience participation show.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400
I didn't know.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400
I know.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.400
Yeah.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.240
Speaking of sound clips, this is going to be very random, but...

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240
Janet.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240
Be so hoggie.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240
I said I'd play that, so never mind.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
What is that?

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.240
Me so honky?

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.240
I'm just embarrassing somebody right now, don't worry about it.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240
Me so honky?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240
I'll tell you guys during the break.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240
Me so honky?

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.240
No, it's not JB.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.240
Can we say who that is on air?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.240
If they fess up in the chat room, then I'll say on air, but if they don't...

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.240
If they don't, then I'll tell you guys during the break.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.240
Rob, we've got some blackmail stuff for you, so...

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240
No you don't!

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240
Yeah, we do.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.240
What?

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240
Life is unfair.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240
Shut up!

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240
Okay, we won't go there.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.240
Oh, yes. Anything else to say on Max USA?

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240
No?

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240
I have some rips about it.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.240
Oh, it's coming out earlier than expected. I don't think we mentioned that. It's going to be out at the end of October. Halloween week.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:32.240
Yes, it's coming out not this coming up Tuesday, but the Tuesday after, supposedly. Anywhere that week, I guess.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240
I've been hearing weird things.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.240
And I'm sure we'll be doing something very special on Orange Lounge.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.240
Sandstorm. Yay.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.160
Yes, I cannot wait to play a sandstorm sandstorm is the best ever

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.920
Guy you know what it's like it's like going to a giant rave. I'm so fucked up

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.520
Let's have some key and make out

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.320
Then we could be friends. Okay, that joke is weeks old. We can't do that anymore. I

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:06.480
Did we did here with the last song that unlock is supposedly what's that the drop the bomb want the bomb? Yeah

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Yay. Yay for dropping bombs.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.480
I wish they really would.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.480
I wish they really would drop the goddamn bomb. That thing is so annoying.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.480
Yeah, one of ScottieD's finest songs, Stick Around.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.480
You know, you can see ScottieD for like half a second in the Stick Around video,

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.480
right before the gerbils that make out with each other.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.480
That is the worst video slash song ever.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480
I disagree, I like that song.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480
No, I don't care.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.480
I think you're stupid.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480
Well speaking of...

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.480
Okay, well anyways, this is way off topic.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.480
There's that song that's in Guitar Freak's eighth mix, or whatever.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.480
That's um, it's Polteri and some other band.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.480
Man, she totally butchers that song too.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480
You wanna talk about Polteri not being able to sing?

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.480
What was that one song with Angel featuring Angel?

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.480
She cannot sing. Was it Ultra High Heels or something like that?

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:09.480
Yeah, Ultra High Heels. I'm sorry, but that chick cannot sing. Paula Terry has a voice, but that chick doesn't. Okay, bye.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.480
No, Megu cannot sing.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:22.480
You know why he says her name? The only shitty thing about Stick Around is the lyrics. The lyrics are so awful. They are awful. They are goddamn awful.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.400
Video is terrible, the singing is terrible, the lyrics are terrible, the song is terrible,

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400
gee, I don't know.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.240
Okay, I have to defend it, the music itself is alright, the singing is alright.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240
I like Miracleman.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:42.280
It's cute though, it's all happy, and the video, it looks like, at the very beginning

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.280
of the video, it looks like we're going to go on a safari.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.040
God, why don't I just put on the Discovery Channel?

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.800
At least I'll hear better music.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.600
Alright, speaking of Guitar Freaks to Draw Mania, I'm glad you brought this up, I wanted

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600
to mention this real fast.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.860
For the first time, it sounds like they're going to be doing a, what they're calling

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:01.800
power-up, which is basically 8th mix, 7th mix plus, you can think about it like DDR,

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.320
they're doing a new version of Guitar Freaks to Draw Mania called the power-up.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:11.700
And from what we're being told, there's going to be some new songs in it, begin by Ryu Kisoka,

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.600
which is one of the B4U chicks, if I'm not mistaken, Ryu, oh sorry, I missed the I, my

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
bad.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.600
Power Up!

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:26.600
And they're returning, they're putting in some more of the old songs that are coming back like Fire in the Dark and On Our Way.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600
How about Haru Spring?

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.600
Isn't Haru Spring in?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:38.600
Those bastards! I only played it once and Jamie made me play Another World and then I played the one where you do the steel drums.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600
Oh, Kachaka.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.600
Kachaka, I like that one, that was cool.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.600
My third favorite song.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
I got a shitty grade but I did good.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.600
No, um, what's the Extra Stage called? It's in Japanese, but it's really, really fun.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600
Is it the Orange Lounge song?

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.600
It's got the characters, the two girls, you know?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
But I don't think it's Orange Lounge.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.600
That is the coolest song ever.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.600
So cool. The Extra Stage, on DrumMania and Guitars.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
Oh, yeah, it's good.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.600
I'm sure some people in our chat room will fill us in on all that.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600
It's really hyper and petty.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600
We honky. We don't know how to read Japanese.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600
Yeah, let's take a break. What do you guys want to play?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
I have no ideas. Any requests in here?

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.600
play a abba

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600
no no abba

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600
oh no

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600
we will do abba

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
we're gonna do

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
we're only kidding

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600
no we're gonna do

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600
you got me started

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.600
we did hyper-boundary gate before the show

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.600
you were in the other room

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.600
or we could do Michael Bolton

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.600
or no

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600
Michael Bolton

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600
i'm gonna do

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.600
when a man becomes a woman

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600
we'll do some abba

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.600
we're gonna do erotic covering abba

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
though

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.600
that's what we're gonna play

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:46.120
So, in the meantime, we're gonna start this set off with, uh, I don't know. Oh, I like

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.040
this one. This is one of my favorite songs from 2DX. We'll start off with this. You're

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.840
listening to Orange Launch Radio. We'll be right back, and then we're gonna talk about

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.500
DDR Extreme and the FUs of the Week. Also, if you want to send me your FUs of the Week

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.120
over private message, you can do that now in the chat room, and we'll get to that coming

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:08.120
back.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:57.040
Moving back when I was a child and dream Moving back where I was a child and dream

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.040
I tried to take you, come to me

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.040
But then first thing, set me free

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:08.040
And fly away to everywhere

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.040
I could do anything

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:19.040
I can get a thing, oh

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.040
I did nothing wrong, oh

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.600
Hey these wings.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.820
Lookin' back when I was on Chad and Blue

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.620
Those are my observed, it didn't come to me

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:40.960
Of course I think of you if we don't fly away

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.500
I just like you

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.680
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.340
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.420
Baby

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.260
I

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.260
After all I've come to be your name

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:47.260
I wasn't jealous before we met Now every born that I see is a potential friend

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:57.260
And never says if it isn't nice You've heard me sayin' that smoking was my only fight

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:05.260
Now I didn't dream Now everything is new

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:14.260
And all I've learned has overturned I left off you

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:21.260
Don't go racing, you're in motion

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:28.260
Get all your love on me

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:37.260
It was like shooting a certain night

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:42.260
A little small talk is fine and baby I'm stuck

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.260
I still don't know what you've done with me

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.260
A grown up woman should never fall so easily

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.260
I see the kind of fear

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.260
And I don't have it near

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.260
I'm satisfied

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260
I keep my pride

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:10.260
But I beg you dear

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:18.260
Don't come wasting your devotion

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:24.260
Lay all your love on me

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:32.260
Don't come sharing your devotion

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:38.260
Lay all your love for me

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:50.260
I've had a few little love affairs

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.260
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scared

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.260
I used to sing at the sunset bar

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.260
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.260
Cause everything is new

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.260
And everything is you

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.260
And all I've learned

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.260
Has over time

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.260
What can I do?

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:37.260
Don't come wasting your devotion Lay all your love on me

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:46.260
Don't go sharing your devotion

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:51.260
Lay all your love on me

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:23.260
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.780
during the break by the way you are listening to orange on radio we were

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.560
talking about guitar freaks 8th and drum mania 7th before the break and thank you

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.980
to our kdn42 who's filling us in calling saying that the extra stage is called

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:05.820
Mikaneiko rock no non mechanical it's Japanese Mikaneiko rock rock sounds like

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:11.740
mechanical but remember there's that cat on parfait the cat oh if Justin's

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.540
listening I'm sure he likes that we gotta have them back on the show by the

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.740
way. Justin and Mike, they were here a few weeks ago, actually a few months ago at this

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:24.460
point. Yeah, they need to return my freaking BeatMania 5 key controller. Oh, oh, oh. About

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.380
time I got that thing back. I think they're both listening, so if you want to put out

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.980
a special shout out. Need controller, want the controller. Can't play BeatMania without

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.920
a controller. And Arkadian thinks that the long version extra stage is something like

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.560
Suminagara Kanojo, but not sure. No, I'm, the bonus stage extra stage is crap. Oh, okay,

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.560
well thank you thank you for sharing

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.480
fair enough

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.720
i love that song power

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.800
power you just like power don't you power and i also like uh... candy star

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.180
i don't really like that one i was expecting to play the actual candy

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.200
it could be worse though it could have had crash

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.160
the

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.500
ingress version of uh...

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.340
one of those songs

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.260
yeah that break down thank you

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.340
what the hell can i

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.740
i can't think of a seat back there under control

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:25.200
the worst song ever

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.420
okay fine

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.920
the middle isn't that bad

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.860
at the beginning is

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.260
crash it

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.800
sounds like war

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.820
uh... tdr mike says you'll get it back when they go to shaft

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:40.920
yes go to shaft

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.460
everybody everybody should go to shaft november fifth

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.660
come get some shaft on november ninth over its scandia

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:53.660
yes i had second on the romanto those uh... fliers who have those

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.320
okay let's do the f use the week

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.000
jamie's not here

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.900
so but if you were here

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.220
This is the part of the show where she'd kick off the F.U. of the week.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:08.180
And so I'm sure her first F.U. of the week would be towards traffic, because that's what's

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.680
keeping her from the show tonight.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.620
So on behalf of Dark Sector, I would like to enter in that F.U. of the week to traffic.

01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.420
Brad, you have an F.U. of the week.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:18.420
Hangovers.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.420
Oh, why is that?

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.080
Well, they're not fun.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.380
That's why you're supposed to drink bread and eat water when you're getting drunk.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.380
Drink bread and eat water.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.680
Is that what I just said?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680
Are you drunk?

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.680
I'm sorry.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.600
No, that's not that big of a deal.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.600
How about you, Rob?

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.600
Do you have an F.U.?

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.600
Do I have an F.U. of the week?

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600
I'm not sure yet.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.600
Go to the others.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.600
Loki?

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.600
Okay, how about Dave?

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.600
Dave, do you have an F.U. of the week?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.600
I do.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.600
Kind of.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.080
F.U. to all my teachers at school for giving me way too much homework.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.360
I missed one day of school, I think two weeks ago, and somehow it was the one day where

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.200
where all the teachers have signed about ten assignments

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.400
for the next two weeks of school, and so I missed that day.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.480
Now I've got a million assignments.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.360
Fuck you, teachers! I know you're listening!

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.700
Go away!

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.320
That's it!

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.760
You get detention for a whole year!

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.240
Some advice. Don't miss school.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.280
Stay in school, kids.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.960
Be cool, stay in school!

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.320
Oh, so what if your state goes to school? Step to a slim gym!

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.400
Oh yeah!

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.400
Okay, anyways, uh, my F.U. of the week has-

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400
Wait, hold on.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.900
Oh, I was going to stay in school, then I threw up over someone else's backpack.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900
Ew!

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.900
Like, okay, go to the office.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:37.900
Grody.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.900
They didn't give me a chance.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.900
Not much is funnier than vomit, seriously.

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.900
Come on, guys.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:49.400
So yeah, uh, my F.U. of the week, once again, goes to, uh, Golf Land Sun Splash.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400
Again!

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.900
Big fat surprise.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.900
Let's start with the fact that Initial D is broken already.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.900
WHAT?!

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.900
One of them is broken.

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.900
No, that's unacceptable!

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.900
UNACCEPTABLE!

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.900
Because of that one being broken, I had to wait for over half an hour to play one game of it.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.900
It's like the new DDR or something.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.900
UNACCEPTABLE!

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:19.900
Anyways, that and also because of the fact that they're advertising that MechWarrior 4 is in the sumo,

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.260
in the CMO, but for some reason it's not there anymore. You can't play MechWarrior 4. So

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.660
those bastards that put in money...

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.300
Wait a minute, I played MechWarrior 4 on that thing.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:29.980
Now.

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.580
So somebody downgraded it?

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.780
I guess.

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:39.020
Major props to those guys. Major props. That takes talent to be that stupid.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.300
Fucking speed theming game. I hate that game.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:48.460
I own that game. I still own that game for almost free. It's not for free because I have

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:55.460
to pay for it. You could always steal a little kid's tokens. Or... Rent it for a small fee.

01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:02.180
Why do that when I can just play like a dollar and win a thousand tickets? What are you gonna

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.380
do with the tickets? You win like a thousand tickets and then what? You get to take something

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:12.380
that's worth a dollar? You get stuff! I bought... I spent probably about five or four dollars

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.200
four dollars plan again

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.800
which is a lot of money

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.100
and i got

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.580
a later p p record

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.940
who care like more a carry glitter

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.980
it looks kind of like the inside

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.420
of one of those model and i think that all of

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.060
tons of balls and like that

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.180
and i think that

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.740
uh...

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.100
no i don't

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.460
it both maybe

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:47.460
I have balls, I just don't like balls.

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.380
Irene, do you have any FUs of the week?

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.180
Yeah, let's change topics.

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.060
Do you like balls?

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:57.500
So, I'm kind of sort of pissed off at my car because it kind of broke down.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.620
But I'm even more pissed off

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:06.620
at book and automotive stores for not carrying the repair manual from my car, so fuck you.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:13.620
p0k3smot42o1 my f-u of the week would go to the entire week itself

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.540
uh... i'm not gonna talk about on the show for those that know me

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.540
it was a really shitty week so let's just leave it at that so that's why i

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.360
feel the latest all week

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.460
the whole damn thing

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.940
let's get to the chat room

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.220
no because kind of angry i hate myself but i want to die i'd slash my wrist the

01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:03.220
other day don't do that

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:10.980
Okay, let's talk about the chat room FUs, those that have been sent to me shall we.

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.460
How are you?

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.460
You wanna read one?

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.460
Okay, let's see...

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.580
Read, oh read SoCal Kicks is, then.

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:17.940
Read that one.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.980
SoCal Kicks says, FU!

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.980
Sky?

01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.060
Actually, it means FU.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.600
FU Sky for saving that sound clip.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.260
You know that Me So Hungry one?

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:27.260
Ohhhhh!

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.260
Hahahaha!

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.260
Ohhhhh!

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.740
Fuck you everyone who can't understand what I said.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.140
It's Hungie, not Hunkey!

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:40.140
and fuck you PSATs because I got worried for nothing, they were the easiest shit ever.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:47.860
I read that it said Hongi, I just thought it sounded funnier as Hongi, I'm sorry Sokaluke.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:52.820
Uhh, Twen sent me some FUs earlier, people stomping on the PPP machine, which makes no

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.420
sense at all.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.380
You know what, I saw some girl playing it completely with her feet, I guess she didn't

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.380
understand that they're, you know, it's a hand game.

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:07.380
It's like Russian Dance Revolution, you use your feet to hit all the heroes.

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:12.380
And then there's like a gun there for you to shoot yourself in Russian Roulette.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:16.380
Did you ever think, by the way, if they did release an American version of PPP, the catch-up song would be on it? I bet you anything.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:27.380
An F you to the chat room for somehow going in to invite only on Friday night. Yeah, that was my fault, fuck you.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.900
Friday night. Yeah, that was my fault. Fuck you. I'm only human, you ass. F you to JB's

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:41.020
dad for wanting to go online so he had to leave. But he's back now, so never mind.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.100
Black Lab sent me one before he had to go. He was here earlier, but he had to go. He

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:49.780
says, fuck his parents shitty computer for being slow and the only computer in the house.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.980
Fuck his little brother for being such a little dickhead this weekend that he's had to watch

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.980
And fuck Star Fox Adventures on GameCube for being too goddamn easy since I beat it in 13 hours flat.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.980
Well, I only played it for 5 minutes and I knew it sucked.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.980
Yeah, I know, I didn't even have to play it and I can tell it sucks. Hello?

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.980
Uh, 23rd Magus says, fuck you to the cold virus for keeping me home all weekend.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.980
I would have been at RVGL Saturday for Arcade Mania for once. Fuck the cold.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.980
That's okay, you didn't miss anything. All the machines are broken.

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:20.980
JB says, uh, his F.U. is to RVGL.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.980
Little kids like to grab asses at RVGL, he's learned.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.980
Well, isn't that something?

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:32.980
Oh, and he told me this, it was literal as in, I think, like, really literal.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.980
Like, very little kid, like a girl or something, I don't know, like four or eight or something.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.980
At least it was a chick grabbing his ass.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:44.980
Yeah, if, like, there was a five-year-old kid grabbing his ass, that would be kind of freaky.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.980
It's Anna Nicole Smith Jr.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.980
either way it's illegal, so come on

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.980
JB would also like to state that Jenny Rom will be his future Rife

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:55.980
Sure, sure

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.980
Rife, I'm sorry, I was Japanese for a minute there

01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980
Wife!

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.980
Watch the movie Simone

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.980
DDR Mike says that, oh this isn't an F.U.

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:09.980
He's telling me when he's going to come visit

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.980
Nevermind, that's not an F.U.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.980
DCB says F.U. to himself for coming in late

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:24.460
that's one tardy detention for a whole week for DCB I don't know some guy in

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:30.060
the chat room these people they're all my best friends I keep tabs on them all

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.840
the time I don't know they just come in on Sunday I read their f-use and they're

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.240
happy how the show works jazz says f you two negative immature people who

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.000
There seemingly can only solve problems with violence.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But violence is the only way!

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.520
You're right.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:56.520
Uh, Matt, it, er, sorry, Loki.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.040
What? Why do they use violence? Why don't they use cellos?

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.840
That's violence, dear. That's guns.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.120
Wha, wha, whaaaaa!

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.680
Jazz is cool.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.100
He says, F you to Roseville Golf Land because it's a shithole and everything is broken.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.900
The game room and Scandi are 600 times better.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.140
Once again, getting into local DDR politics on this international program, but that's

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.740
okay.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.740
Everybody should know what a shithole Roseville Golf Land is.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:23.740
Exactly.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.940
Maybe one of the assholes from Golf Land will be listening.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:26.940
You know what I heard?

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.940
Probably not.

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.020
You remember that one time that I went over there and took pictures of all the broken

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.020
shit?

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.060
That some of the employees got online and saw that?

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.060
They were pissed.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.060
Pissed about why?

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:36.060
Pissed about what?

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:37.060
That they're telling the truth?

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:43.100
truth? God! Fuck you! Yeah, I'm gonna do it again! Just for that! And then I'm gonna take

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.700
pictures of you when you're picking your nose and taking breaks when you shouldn't be and

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:51.580
telling off little kids and pissing in the cokes and whatever you do over there. F you!

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:57.700
I hate you! Die! No, but see, like, they just really actually did the first teching that

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:01.740
they've done in a couple of months and they fixed guitar freaks and keyboard reindeer.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.740
So, if you went there now, a lot of stuff wouldn't be broken.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.740
They turned up...

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.740
Yeah, if you went there now, I'm sorry, you'd probably see everything broken again.

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:17.740
Well, I went there earlier today, the Guitar Freaks was turned up really loud, nice and loud, drumming is turned down almost to silent.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:26.740
Let me add that I played Guitar Freaks for the first time in a long time, a couple days ago, and my ears were ringing afterwards. It was so loud.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:33.740
I guess they don't realize that these games are based on music, and you need to kind of make it sound good or else it's not worth playing.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740
I want to play Godard Freaks of the Silent.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:41.740
I'm told that Roseville isn't the only golf land that's having problems apparently. SHGL got their 2DX screen fixed.

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:51.740
I didn't even know that SHGL got 2DX back, but apparently they did. They got their screen fixed and now it's broken again.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.740
So, hey, it runs in the family I guess.

01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:02.340
We should just go to all the golf lands and quote-unquote overplay the games and make

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:07.500
all of them, you know, wanting the arcade doctor and then they'll see how bad it's gonna

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.500
affect.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500
Yeah.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500
That's such a joke.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.540
I need to pay a visit to the arcade doctor.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:15.100
Is that all the golf lands that do that or is that just Roseville or do all the golf

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.100
lands have the arcade doctor?

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.100
Who cares?

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.100
I think they know what I am implying.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.220
But they'll see how much it suffers, you know, and like, you know, yeah, they'll see how

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.340
much people don't like it and then they won't get any business and they'll die.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:31.340
But the thing is, you can't go play the games if they're all broken already. We're not going to make any money.

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:35.340
Well, the ones that are still working, we should just overplay them.

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.340
Well, don't quote. Anyway, I want to finish up. There's some FUs.

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.340
DDR Mike did send an FU after... Oh, yes, Irene, you have an FU.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:47.340
It's not quote-unquote. It's quote-end-quote. Why would you unquote something?

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.340
Somebody please tell me. It's quote-end-quote.

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.340
Shut up. You lose. You lose.

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:59.340
DDR Mike says, F you to Mountain Mike's left side pad down arrow because it stuck for three

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.340
minutes straight on Saturday night.

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:08.340
Hey wait Rob, I have another F you. F you to you guys.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.340
Everybody hates you.

01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.340
You don't have any vanilla cokes though.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:16.180
I don't. Go buy one yourself. I'm sick of buying you people crap. I'm just ghetto poor

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:20.300
this week. I'm going to the store after the show. Not that I'll do you any good until

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.220
next week but hey just thought you'd enjoy knowing thanks a lot don't worry

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.420
I'll bring Krispy Kreme one day some advice get a job and then slinky's

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.380
follow-up is that Japanese people own us all and that's not local just remember I

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:38.860
said is and there's some both kick-ass I might add

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:47.260
that's enough heart spring or so Cal kick says shine loose let's move along

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.340
along here. Oh, thank you teacher. Thank you for telling us how to run the show. No, I'm

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.300
just kidding. You're right. We need to hurry up. We're not going to get to do list list

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:59.140
if we don't talk about DDR Extreme. Talk list list. Screw that. Wait until next week. Alright.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:03.900
Let's talk about DDR Extreme. What do you want to say? Why don't you do a sim file update

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.380
for us, Loki, and then lead on into DDR Extreme if you want. Go for it, dude. You're the one

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:14.620
who wants to change topics. It's all you. Sorry. Let's start off with StepMania. Let's

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:19.220
beta six uh... release candidate three better known as uh...

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:23.560
step mania version three final uh... there's going to be going hopefully

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.500
should be the final one a lot of fixes done there and that's available now from

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.340
uh...

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.060
source

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:33.100
forged dot com or whatever their site is there's a link on that your maniacs go

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.140
check that out

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.420
so it's a pretty good i i played a little bit today it is a lot faster so

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.620
uh...

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.740
just go try that

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:43.860
uh... see other than that d r east coast invasion is back up and some server

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:48.060
problems earlier this week and everyone thought they were gone for good but they're back so

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.060
go check them out.

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.060
Any new contests by them coming up?

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.060
Uh, no.

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:56.120
They're doing right now one of the things, it's kind of like to get the most popular

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.220
character in all the DDR games.

01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:02.220
They finished with the female characters and I believe, ah shit, I can't remember her name.

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.220
Alice?

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.220
Yeah.

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.900
Alice, I don't know, I just, I'm just thinking, oh Emmy.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.900
Oh yeah, Emmy.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:09.900
No, no, no.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:10.900
Not Emmy.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.900
Alice, there's Alice.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900
Yeah, Alice.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.900
Big surprise, Steve. I could have told you that contest in two seconds, but that's alright.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:48.900
The coolest thing is that you can speed up the speed of the song. That's the coolest. Not like how fast the arrows go, but the actual song.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:53.900
Like, I think it's up to 1.5 times the actual speed now. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:59.900
But anyways, oh my gods, I can beat Max Unlimited S4R with two times speed. Oh my god, it's dizzy.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:00.900
Whatever.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:19.900
Were there any new released characters online for the next release?

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.700
so they're doing them every two weeks now.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.180
I noticed it's on my Payday Fridays that they released two characters, it seems.

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.940
Yeah, I mean, I really don't care. There are all these freaky, weird characters and no

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.440
one plays that game, so it really doesn't matter. Aside from that, like I said, my site,

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.300
I was thinking, you know, maybe once I get things going a little bit, since, you know,

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.700
DDR East Coast Invasion does their own tourney mixes, they might actually run one. And actually

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:57.620
have prizes, because you know me, in my edit contest, I had tons of prizes.

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.740
yes so yes and you'll be doing all those door prices at SHAPT

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:04.340
yes yeah i'll clean up my prize closet there right on

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:09.300
oh you're cleaning out your closet oh that yeah

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:14.580
ha ha ha anyway okay and now ddr maxx extreme yes

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.140
maxx extreme they've been doing the uh the testing started this friday

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:23.620
um back there in japan and uh people have been playing it and

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.700
actually a bunch of new songs have come out

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:31.820
a couple to mention. There's going to be a new Revenge song. It's all sixteenths and

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:37.140
thirty-second notes. And it's sixty beats per minute. It's sixty-five beats per minute,

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:43.980
yeah. Isn't it called DDR Extreme? Yes. Not Max Extreme? Whatever. Yeah, okay, bye. My

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:49.180
bad. DDR Extreme. DDR Extreme. And that's called Bag. I don't know. What a name for

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.180
Big asian groove.

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.180
New paranoia coming out, paranoia survivor.

01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:01.180
It goes from 135 BPM to like 270.

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:05.180
So that should be pretty ancient.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:10.180
Isn't there something that you have to do on that song? Like you double A it and you can get an extra stage or something?

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.180
No. No. Stop! Damn it!

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:21.180
So, here's what's going on with Paranoid Survivor. Like Max on the last song, if you double A, you get an extra stage.

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.180
Well, the thing is, with the extra stage of Max, you can pick any song you want, plus some more actually appear.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:33.180
You have the new Max, which is Legend of Max that's going to be out, and then there's also Paranoid Survivor.

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:38.180
Now, supposedly if you double A Legend of Max, you get Sakura.

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:43.180
And I'd like to point out, I was correct, and I called it a long time ago that Sakura's going to be the bonus song.

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:45.180
You're the shit.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:47.180
Yes, so I know that.

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:55.180
And we haven't really heard, I guess, if there's another extra stage, you know, different one, if there's Paranoid Survivor, if someone, you know, double A's that.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.180
Every time I hear that, I think of that Destiny's Child song.

01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:01.180
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:06.180
No, no, no, it's like this, you double A Paranoid Survivor, you get to vote somebody out of the arcade.

01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:10.180
Or as 23rd Magus says, out stomp, out wink, out dance.

01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.180
Exactly.

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:12.180
What's out wink?

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:15.180
What do you wink when you play DDR?

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.180
Out twink.

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.180
Out twink?

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.180
Yeah, twink.

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:19.180
I don't know.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:26.180
I've heard the word twink before, but it has absolutely nothing to do with DDR, I guarantee

01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.180
you that.

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180
I'm not going to elaborate.

01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.180
Other than that, let's see if we can pull up the song list here.

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.180
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can pull up the song list.

01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:40.180
For those that don't know, one of the big people that gives us information on the Japanese

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:48.640
these location tests is the guy known as Aaron in Japan. His website is over at aaroninjapan.com.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.800
Easy enough to remember. You should definitely check out his site because we're stealing

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.600
some news from him right now and I have to credit where we're getting news from.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.200
Anyway, some of the new songs, they're gonna be in there. We've got

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.320
Irresistible, or, what the hell is that? Irresistible Mint?

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.360
Oh, oh, he meant Twink Out! Like, I think it's a rave thing.

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:11.520
Okay, whatever. Anyway, that's a weird name for a song by Wildside.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.400
Irresistible Mint, whatever that means. That's stupid.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.160
Speed Over Beethoven, which is, you know, on Speed 9, I believe.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.600
That's pretty good. Then there's also We Are the Champions,

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:31.600
a cover of that

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.600
so it's it's it's a queen he makes

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.340
anyways uh...

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.880
big gate your extreme

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.320
uh...

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.480
that's the we've got twink revolution

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:48.120
some of the older songs coming back we've got uh... damn derriam rhythm please synchronize

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.080
love i believe in miracles if you were here

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.120
and others

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.680
There's a larger song list out there that has a lot more of the old original ones.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.580
From what I understand, every Max 2 track is back, and from what somebody else was saying...

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.520
Every Max 2 track and every Max 1 track is going to be back.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.220
Except for Telephone Operator, right?

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.800
Telephone Operator and Follow Me are still gone, from what I heard, right?

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.620
But Ghost is back, and all the good ones are back except Telephone Operator, I love Telephone

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620
Operator.

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:17.360
Bye-bye Baby Balloons back, much to our enjoyment.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.480
From what I hear is that initially you don't see them on the list, that you have to sort

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.440
your list a different way to see them.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.480
That's what I'm hearing.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480
I don't know if they have...

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.480
Why would you do that?

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.480
That doesn't make sense.

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480
Well, no.

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.200
I think that it's a huge list, I mean, you didn't see them right away.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.560
Also, they're going to have an unlock system, similar to the Macs do, except it's going

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.280
to be fewer points in between, a ton more unlocks instead.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.880
You're going to have also, like before we've mentioned the non-stop mode, they're going

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.560
actually have a player's best non-stop that you can play on there, which is kind of cool.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.240
It'd be the top four song.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.520
Arkadian can get out the pen and pencil again and start writing down player's best every

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.240
week. That was pretty cool. I remember when Forthmix was out and he was writing it down

01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:58.840
every week, and it was like, it was like, Casey Kasem's top 40 and the player's best.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.800
Exactly.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.120
Sorry you had to be here. Inside joke, I guess.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.640
Then of course, you know, not to be, not, not any surprise at all, drop the bomb, the

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.200
System FX mix.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.720
Of course, they couldn't stay U.S. exclusive for very long, but there are still some-

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:16.360
i'm sure you'll see the dynamite rate one on there too i'm sure that's going to be in

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.120
there so cold so cold uh... yes so in love kind lady g you know we're going to

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.360
be on there

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.840
and uh... can be

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.080
can they tell us on the forces that he was an eight-footer

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.360
but and now there's conflicting reports because one report saying the steps are

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.380
as hard as the d w i just thought that every other reports and

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.400
it's a footer

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:38.000
i would i would say how much i believe the eight-footer thing before it would

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:38.920
be able to go

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.960
i don't know sources that this way at some point we will be able to make it

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960
hearts

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.040
yes that's right you're gonna get in there and

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.800
do your edits, your homemade edits

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.860
uh-huh and uh... let's see here

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.800
we've got uh...

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.640

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.480

01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.760
that's gonna be in there um...

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.240
la mora et la

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.760
whatever la mora et la biete

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.280

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.240
uh... feeling- oh goodie more para, is that para or is that- no that's dance maniacs

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.000
i'm sorry feeling of love uh... moba moga frozen ray

Frozen Array, Miracle Moon, L.E.D. Light Style, Destiny Lovers, and this is too cool, from

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.080
Mambo A Go Go, Gamaland A Couple is on there, that rules.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:36.720
And not on this list right here, because this is an old list, JetWorld is on there.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.720
Very cool.

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.720
JetWorld is on there.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.520
Let me tell them, the steps could be cool.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.440
Let me scroll on down and see if I see some other stuff.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.440
Why?

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.440
Here's some stuff, these were in the ONI and non-stop courses, they're only available there

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.440
apparently.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.680
Yeah, at least right now probably until you unlock them.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.120
They have Happy Wedding, I believe that's from 7-0.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.320
Somewhere Jamie is excited.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.260
general like i mentioned before

01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.480
is to be on their uh...

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.620
colors

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.660
police one hundred seconds

01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.760

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.520

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.360
why oh hello we didn't see them real

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.860
anyways um...

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.080
if you were here

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.040
shooting star

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.280
it came with

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.960
but that yes sir that's about it

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.600
that's much more uh...

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.480
two hundred thirty songs

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.640
uh... the test is only one fifty percent done something like that

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.320
they didn't know when it was

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.960
be released higher

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.000
and the year

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.960
early spring we've heard about it

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:51.040
late december and early january

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.360
right after new year's eve a shipment let's just put this way

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.000
that machine right there will

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
We'll definitely own. I mean, there's no doubt about it. 230 songs.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
The question is, how soon before it breaks? Our local golf land.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Golf land, man. It's going to be scandium, man.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And there's also another report, Aaron in Japan mentions that SHINE was triple-8 on heavy within two hours.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
By one of those insane Japanese dancers, Yosaku.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Of course, we don't want to obviously reveal to any Konami people that someone got pictures from the test location,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.700
someone did get pictures from Test Location, someone that's website we might be looking

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:35.700
at right now, and supposedly they should be leaked out a couple weeks from now.

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:36.700
Okay, cool.

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.060
So we'll have to look for that.

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:41.580
I don't really know if it's going to reveal anything, probably not, who cares.

01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.520
Probably it's just going to be more kind of screenshots, and I like those.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.820
When Max 2 was first out, they got a lot of up-close screenshots, that was pretty cool,

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.220
I'm waiting for those kind of shots.

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:52.580
There are people that have access to them, I don't have access to them because I'm not

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:56.580
I'm not bored and I don't know Aaron, so obviously I can't get access to them.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:01.580
He hasn't password protected, so there's no way for us to get him, unfortunately.

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:05.580
Let's see what else is here, if there's any other exciting news to share.

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:11.580
No new upgrade for the cabinet, like as posted a long time ago on Team Boilo.

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:14.580
It's the same software, it should be an easy upgrade.

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:17.580
They're saying that Speed Over Beethoven is the best new song.

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.580
A lot of people are saying that.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.580
i think i can get that from one of the uh...

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580
i've heard it, it's uh...

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.580
i can't remember, i'm not good at classical music

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:26.580
it's on speed 9 isn't it?

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.580
it's on speed 9

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.580
it's on that one song, it's like

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.580
ah shit, i can't remember, it's the one

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.580
uh

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.580
i don't remember it

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:39.580
yeah, yeah, that one

01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.580
yeah, fairly

01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:42.580
yes

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:44.580
it's a speed mix

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:47.580
it's like happy hardcore type speed mix

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:50.080
I'll see if I can get that for you guys and play it next week.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.580
I know somebody who has Speed 9.

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.080
I know I have that song, so...

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.580
Alright, we'll play that for you guys next week.

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.080
I don't have it right now. Sorry, guys.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.080
If somebody in the chat room has it, feel free to send it to me.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.580
I'll play it before the end of the show.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.080
That's pretty much all that's up with DDR Extreme,

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.580
other than the very girly shot picture of Naoki.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.580
You know, they have pictures from Teslocation.

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.580
Oh, and Naoki's diary. We haven't talked about Naoki's diary.

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580
It was a filler. We really don't...

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.080
It was a filler. It was nothing. There was nothing new.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.360
It was him bitching about more songs we don't really care about, and it was also talking

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360
about-

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.800
Wow, wow, my life is so traumatic.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.560
They were interviewing some people that were working on it and asking him stupid questions

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.280
like, what's your favorite character?

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.720
Like our listless.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.120
Stupid things can only be done on this show.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:46.800
Listen up.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.440
I think we're going to take another quick break, and then we're going to wrap up this

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.440
show.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.440
How's that sound?

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.440
Oh, thank you.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.440
That was terrible.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.440
Yes, it was.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:02.560
What shall we play in this break?

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.560
Let's start off with...

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:08.440
You want to hear Miracle Moon?

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.680
Okay, let's hear Miracle Moon.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.680
Fair enough.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.280
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:20.280
be right back to wrap up the show

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.280
You're the only one who has to go now

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.280
And she could make the world a better place

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.280
And she could make the world a better place

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.280
I'm the king that came up

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:32.280
Give me something I can do

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.280
Do you believe in love?

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.280
Yes, I do believe in love

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.280
I'm the king that came up

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:22.280
The only love I call to know You are the angel of my love

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:30.280
It's got to be my heart Being beside you while I'm alone at all

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:39.280
I wanna look closer to you, my love Until the day I die

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.740
I'll be your everything

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:45.160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:48.420
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.240
Don't you change your head, but I will be your man

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.280
Don't want you now, gun, doesn't matter where you

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.080
One and one is two

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.700
Don't you be the crew

01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:00.780
Singing that love is what we have to do

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.920
Hold your hand, we'll be together

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.040
Cause it's yours and mine

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.780
Forever we're in this world

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:37.740
Okay, as promised, uh, we were able to get

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:41.660
a copy of that Speed Over Beethoven song. Thank you very much to DDR Mike for saying

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:45.340
that to me. We're going to play it for you right now. This is going to be a DDR Extreme.

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.080
It'll be an edited down version. This is the full version though, so you guys can get a

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:55.080
sample of it. This is Rose with Speed Over Beethoven.

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.080
Let's open, let's open, let's open

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.080
Let's open, let's open, let's open

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:32.080
You think you're nice, you make me cry

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:35.080
I need you back, to save my life

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:38.080
Because again, I'm just really weak

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.080
Listen to this song

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.080
And I'm gonna keep you free

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:45.080
You make me laugh, living your life

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.320
I need you one love, yeah, love, yeah, oui, oui

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.320
Music gonna save your life

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.320
You're really weird, music's gonna save your life

01:49:48.320 --> 01:50:10.320
We apologize for the awkward end to that Speed Over Beethoven song, but that was right out

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.620
of a non-stop Speed 9 album that didn't have time to edit that together, because that just

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.500
got sent to me.

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.500
We hope you enjoyed that though.

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:24.500
pretty cool song what you guys think of that? It was cool. It was good. La la la la la la

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:31.500
la la la la la la la la la. I forgot the words. Beethoven! Beethoven! Beethoven! Was

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:38.000
that supposed to be another like Waka Laka song or something? No. But it's not Jenny

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.320
Rom. Beethoven! Beethoven! Beethoven! I think I kind of like that a little more than Beethoven's

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:53.600
virus even a little bit just a little bit so what was that call that was more

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:58.800
important than the show Brad I'm just kidding out here and I don't care I

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.680
thought I put you on the spot we're winding down the end of the show here oh

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:08.000
I'm sorry oh yeah I see you want to have a conversation this year while I try to

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.040
do the show in this year that's fine that's fine I can do that anything else

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.040
I wish you guys wanted to get out of your systems before the show was done.

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.040
Nope.

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.040
No?

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.480
There's no other things you guys want to talk about?

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:25.880
Let's talk about... Yes.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.800
Irene said it, but it kind of didn't get picked up on the mic.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.760
What would you like to talk about, Saxirene?

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.760
It's great.

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:48.760
You can't relate sex to Bamani in any way, outside of erotic songs?

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.840
Well, I'm sure you can.

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:54.920
I think, like, they should, you know, how you were saying about the announcer, you know,

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:59.160
relating it to, like, a guy juicing or whatever, and if you fail a song, you just say, oh,

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.160
well, premature ejaculation happens.

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.160
I think that would be funny if the answer said that.

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.160
Yeah, okay, here you go.

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.160
This is it! This is my money shot!

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.160
Ugh!

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:16.160
69 combo!

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.160
Oh yeah!

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:27.160
Weren't we talking about that a couple weeks ago when we said the name of the mix was going to be Extreme, DDR Extreme, we were talking about DDR Sextreme?

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.180
well that was a scandia where we're talking about whether we're gonna have

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.140
a poll in the middle of the pad

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:33.200
yeah and all the erotic songs

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.000
yeah so that's really a sixty nine combo slate

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.040
all dot

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.240
yeah like that

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.800
it's really terrible

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.880
and they were like

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.480
they're doing that we're going to like uh...

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.520
uh... uh...

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.940
but uh... you know

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:54.720
because you know yet

01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.740
i don't know how

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:04.120
what is showing right down the toilet real fast didn't

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:09.520
uh... yeah right when we said that this is orange lambs real uh...

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.580
people is there is uh...

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.080
yet

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.200
uh...

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:20.120
that

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:24.000
he said

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:00.280
pretty scandalous stuff in that. Uh, not really. I mean, it's not too bad. It's a pretty, it's

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:05.400
a stylish film, I would say. Like, a lot of stuff that's, like, backwards and weird shit

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.520
going on there. Like, it starts in, you know, it's one of those movies that starts in the

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:12.520
middle of the movie and then goes back and then comes to the middle again and then goes

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:19.440
forward. Okay, I saw, uh, The Transporter on, I think, Saturday. That was pretty good.

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.520
and

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.540
what yeah i want for that but it's like the guy there is like the master

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:28.360
that i heard that movie was a piece of shit but i was just what i heard

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.520
where from

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:31.680
they're not sure what the people that

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.040
right up there to me

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.760
well i think that you guys went so spirit away that's of interest to a lot

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.120
of your people on

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.920
you said but i want to transfer sex but you like showgirls

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:45.200
but i'd like to know girls permits comic value

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.860
there is much comic value we have showgirls

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.860
It was really funny on TV where they tried to censor all the boobies.

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.860
Oh, the VH1.

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.860
Yes, you have to see Showgirls on VH1.

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:57.860
Don't see Showgirls for the first time on VH1, but watch it for the second time on VH1.

01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:58.860
Where they have to...

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.860
Follow your Showgirls DVD?

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.860
You sure can, honey.

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:02.860
You ruined the effect of the...

01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:03.860
Yes you can, darlin'.

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:04.860
...insult.

01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.860
Oh yes, tell us about Spirited Away.

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:10.860
Now, was the dub as crappy as the sub?

01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:11.860
What?

01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:12.860
That's what I want to know.

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:13.860
I mean, I was being...

01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:14.860
Was it crappier than the sub?

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:15.860
I'm sorry.

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.860
Spirited Away was a great movie.

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.860
I just want to know if they fucked up the dub.

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:43.860
I personally used to, when Princess Mononoke came out here in America and I went and saw it in the theaters, I was saying that it was the greatest dub so far. There was nothing as good. This, in my opinion, is better. There's no annoying Claire Danes. But seriously, the dub is great. Everybody does a great job. There's no overacting in it at all.

01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.060
um...

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.780
and it didn't change anything that didn't need to be changed the names

01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.940
are premature they're all the same

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.900
there are a couple jokes thrown in that weren't in the original but they were

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:57.120
funny and they made

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.920
they didn't ruin it

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.960
airbase should really go see that movie is as good as i thought subversion is

01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.380
excellent

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:09.300
when the best films and if you don't make it for all you people who don't

01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.620
know

01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:16.620
I know a lot of people listening will know, but I was feeling a lot of the parents in the theater were like Disney, it's a Disney movie, yeah.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:21.620
And then Studio G, I was like, oh God, I'm talking to myself about it.

01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:25.620
It was Miyazaki who made the movie, that's what he was trying to say.

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:29.620
Alright, I also saw part of Initial D, the anime series, after playing the game.

01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:32.620
Dude, that anime rocks.

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.620
Hello and welcome to last week.

01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:38.660
I'd like to mention something, it's video game related.

01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:44.580
I just heard that they're making a sequel to Final Fantasy X, which is pretty interesting.

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:50.700
Okay, now from what I hear, from what I hear, in the U.S., those two sequels that they're

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:55.900
making to Final Fantasy X, there's a Unistory and there's a, what's the other chick, the

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.900
Riku.

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:00.220
There's a Unistory and a Riku story, and in Japan, those are going to be released as separate

01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:04.500
games, FF10, 1 and 2, and please keep in mind my word is not gospel, I'm just spreading

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:07.380
dirty rumors I've heard so if I'm wrong then whatever.

01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:08.380
I've seen screenshots.

01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:11.260
Well, no, no, I know they exist but this is the thing, this is the thing.

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:15.020
You know how Final Fantasy XI, it's online in Japan and it's kind of been a bit of a

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.660
wreck because they've had a lot of problems with the servers, they've had a problem with

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:21.980
the, they won't release the hard drives here in America so there's really no way they're

01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:26.340
going to be able to release Final Fantasy XI in America and playing online games in

01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:30.600
America is kind of, I don't know, I don't know any online game I've ever seen that people

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.540
take it seriously, except EverQuest, which is where people take it way too seriously,

01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:38.160
so I think Final Fantasy Online in America would kind of be stupid anyway.

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.160
Ultima Online.

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.920
But, what's going to happen, since they can't do it on the Playstation 2 because they have

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.620
no hard drive, they're going to release it on the computer. It's Final Fantasy Online.

01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:50.500
Final Fantasy XI here in America is going to be those side stories. They're going to

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:53.140
release them as one game here in America. That's just what I've heard.

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:58.780
But what's really strange about it is, Yuna looks like frickin' Lara Croft. She's got

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:02.540
I got two pistols

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.460
I don't know, it's just weird

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:09.900
She's carrying forbidden machina? What's wrong? She's violating the teachings

01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:16.140
I think she said screw the teachings in Final Fantasy X the first place, and that and supposedly machina has taken over

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:20.180
Spoiler free show please, spoiler free show, I haven't really played through X

01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:21.620
Alright

01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:24.220
Well, yeah, exactly, thank you

01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:31.220
taking over Spira is after 10 anyway, so it has nothing to do with 10.

01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:35.740
Spoiler free show please that includes you people in the chat room. God damn, so not

01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:40.200
everybody's finished the game yet. Some of us are just now getting our USPS2. Some of

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:45.200
us wasted all their money buying a Japanese PS2 and can't afford to get an American one.

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.000
Yeah, and those people play 2DX, so they suck.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
You don't know me. Sit down. Talk to the hand.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I'm sitting.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Yeah.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Other than that, there's also, supposedly, they're selling now an international PS2.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It plays both U.S. and Japanese games.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
What? I don't believe that.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I don't know. It's on YesAsia.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Oh, no. You know what is tricky? I saw that it's just the way they worded it.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Go back and read it very carefully. It's not an all-region DVD. They just try to make it sound like that.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Alright.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
If I'm wrong, then fuck them.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Alright, we're running a little over. I want to finish up the last show. Final thoughts. Any final thoughts from you, Loki?

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Check on my site if you haven't yet. It's www.leechfromloki.tk

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Alright, any final thoughts from Dave?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Go watch Initial D. It is cool.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Cool.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.400
Any final thoughts from Brad?

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.240
Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't done?

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.480
My bad.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.080
My final thought is that I am done now.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.600
Okay, thank you.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.000
Has to go.

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.800
Any final thoughts from you, Mr. Brad?

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:05.040
It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:06.040
All right, thank you.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.040
Any final thoughts from you, Ari?

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.040
Bye.

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:10.040
Bye, that's it?

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.400
Oh, okay, fair enough.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.760
My final thought is that we're going to be doing, after the show tonight, we're going

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:18.960
I'm gonna stay live, we're not gonna deconnect the stream

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:21.540
we're not gonna be here talking, in fact most of us will be gone

02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:24.960
but we're just gonna play some music, we're gonna play all 2DX music

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.440
all night long, until I feel like shutting it off

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.160
so you can go ahead and stick with the stream after this show is done

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.500
that's what we're gonna be doing, gonna be playing 2DX all night long

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.160
every single style, 2nd through 8th every track that I've got

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:40.120
Which is everything except I don't think I have all THE 8th

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.700
I've got just about everything

02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:45.200
So we're gonna play 2DX music all night long until I feel like shutting it off

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.080
Enjoy that, you guys.

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:47.580
That's it.

02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:49.040
That's all I've got to say for now.

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:50.160
So good night, everybody.

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:51.700
