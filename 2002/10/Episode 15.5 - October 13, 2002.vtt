It is an experimental show, ladies and gentlemen. Let me remind you.

06:54.780 --> 07:01.780

I'm going to hand you a microphone.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.620
No, you can't yell.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.620
Whee!

11:52.620 --> 11:54.620
Slidey song.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.620
I finally passed that.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.620
So, let's talk about DDR Extreme.

11:58.620 --> 12:00.620
Yay!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.620
DDR Sextreme!

12:02.620 --> 12:04.620
Derek, let's change, if we can.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.620
I don't change for anyone.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.620
You can sit on that side of the table, I'll sit on this side.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.620
This is really great radio, by the way.

12:14.620 --> 12:16.620
Alright, here we go.

12:16.620 --> 12:23.620
table-to-table

12:24.580 --> 12:27.940
i always saw a low-key is kind of our news desk of the show so i'll let him

12:27.940 --> 12:30.340
talk about the art stream even though he's not prepared to but i'm sure i'll

12:30.340 --> 12:32.520
have something nice to say by the way

12:32.520 --> 12:36.740
low-key now doing news for team while oh congratulations

12:36.740 --> 12:41.400
actually have a comment about that this is kind of an f you to myself

12:41.400 --> 12:44.280
i was viciously pointed out uh... by

12:44.280 --> 12:49.760
DJ Paranoid to have copied his list and put it on Team Gwyla, which is a big, big, big,

12:49.760 --> 12:58.760
big, big, big note of if you don't give credit. No, that's plagiarism. And, ooh, oh. And anyways,

12:58.760 --> 13:03.000
in the, to begin with, okay, first off, I copied Black Lab's list at the begin with,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
okay. And that list-

13:04.000 --> 13:05.680
See, Black Lab's from Black Lab.

13:05.680 --> 13:11.080
Yeah, it doesn't matter about him. So I took his list at first. It didn't have any frickin'

13:11.080 --> 13:15.960
names on it, none of the artist's names, so that kind of sucked. So I borrowed his list,

13:15.960 --> 13:20.200
I forgot to put, I mean, shit man, I'm putting this list up like way early in the morning,

13:20.200 --> 13:25.080
I'm so damn tired. I do that, and then finally it doesn't hit me until he's like,

13:25.080 --> 13:30.680
ass, thanks for stealing my list. So I've been hearing about it for like the last three days,

13:30.680 --> 13:35.640
you know, gave big credit to him and their, you know, Bhavani style for translating

13:35.640 --> 13:39.960
Naoki's urinal to make it actually legible. The big question is, did you guys kiss the makeup?

13:39.960 --> 13:57.960
No, but I kissed ass, I sent him emails, PMs, I even apologized to Spigamous in the DDR Maniacs chat room, so hopefully some way he got the message, you know, that I am gratefully sorry and be happy to make it up to him, you know, maybe shared resources for some story or whatnot, you know.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
Put out.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
No.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.960
No, no, there will be no putting out, okay? I'm sorry, that's not happening.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.600
happening but i think i've gone you know above and beyond to apologize for simple

14:09.600 --> 14:14.400
mistake i mean that got fixed within a couple hours gone down and look yes and

14:14.400 --> 14:18.000
look if he gives you hell for it just use the nistia global gate translator

14:18.000 --> 14:20.080
because it does it nearly perfectly anyway

14:20.080 --> 14:23.920
well it wasn't that it was just like i used his list that had the names on it

14:23.920 --> 14:27.920
whoop-dee-doo i mean you know i could have just done

14:27.920 --> 14:32.560
the list myself you know next no i'm not plagiarizing anymore but if i

14:32.560 --> 14:37.960
there were, I certainly would reformat the shit so it wouldn't look anything like anyone

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
else's.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.960
And you just played Joel Ives' Black Lab, because that's okay.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.960
That doesn't matter, he's in our...

14:42.960 --> 14:45.160
He's probably in the chatroom right now.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
He's nobody important.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.160
In the future.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.240
Sorry, Black Lab, I didn't mean that.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.880
No, but anyways, yeah, so I'm doing news now, it kind of sucks because then I have to be

14:52.880 --> 14:56.720
on top of all the news stories instead of browsing the internet and, you know, chatting

14:56.720 --> 14:57.720
in chatrooms.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.800
You're on top, going down, bending over backwards, good lord, you're an acrobat.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.800
Down, down, down.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.800
Yeah, so...

15:05.800 --> 15:11.800
Hey, but, but, one of the things I did, I was able to have that, you know, one else did have

15:11.800 --> 15:17.800
is I actually got those clips from the DDR Max USA, all the new samples are supposedly gonna be in there

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
because everyone gave me shit about that too, saying,

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
Oh, how do you know that shit's gonna be in there?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.800
It's not confirmed? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.800
Like, I really give a shit. I'm just ripping samples for people to hear.

15:27.800 --> 15:33.800
I have a comment on that. If they're not going to be in the game, why do they exist?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.800
Now the old stuff, I understand. Konami? Lazy? Certainly.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.800
They leave the old stuff from Max Japan in there, like ghosts and things like that, and they sneak in there.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.800
You know, but these new remixes weren't just done for the hell of it.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.800
Well, I don't know, maybe Naoki gets bored one night and he's doing his nails like,

15:49.800 --> 15:51.800
Hmm, maybe I'll remix, uh...

15:51.800 --> 15:54.800
Dear Diary, I ran out of black figure-down polish,

15:54.800 --> 15:59.800
I decided to remix a new song with my best buddy, who will be unnamed.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
Why would they be in there if they're not going to be in the final game?

16:02.800 --> 16:05.800
Does it just specifically throw us off?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
Well, even if it is just there to throw us off,

16:07.800 --> 16:11.800
hey, it's a Nubomani remix clip, that's newsworthy.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.800
Well then, the fact that, like, Kakumei was in there, okay, the clip for Kakumei,

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
and they're like, some guy's like,

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
no, that got cut, and so did ghosts.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.800
I know for sure.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.800
Because I'm actually developing the game, so I know.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.640
would you like to know what your source

16:25.640 --> 16:29.200
i'm always a man if you guys got information search areas that call me

16:29.200 --> 16:30.520
tell me i'm wrong you know

16:30.520 --> 16:33.040
search and some info

16:33.040 --> 16:34.060
that's right unless

16:34.060 --> 16:37.260
unless you work for konami where you're sleeping with someone who works for

16:37.260 --> 16:38.920
konami

16:38.920 --> 16:41.740
we just can't believe you i'm sorry we're just gonna have to always told you

16:41.740 --> 16:45.060
know the game comes out so

16:45.060 --> 16:46.360
i'm sorry

16:46.360 --> 16:50.220
i'll get right on sleeping with everybody

16:50.220 --> 16:51.400
but the fact that

16:51.400 --> 16:56.240
yeah i don't know would anybody at this table put out for information on that

16:56.240 --> 16:58.440
you are sad and i think

16:58.440 --> 17:00.000
right now

17:00.000 --> 17:01.840
that all of my fiance

17:01.840 --> 17:03.760
manages a game stop

17:03.760 --> 17:07.240
i don't have to put out it was comes with the job but you know that he does

17:07.240 --> 17:08.900
it does he get information that

17:08.900 --> 17:10.360
yet about an army

17:10.360 --> 17:13.880
sometimes like game releases we doesn't really get know the rally under the

17:13.880 --> 17:16.400
storm had information that i can talk about that

17:16.400 --> 17:17.160
i'd go down it

17:17.160 --> 17:20.340
go down some chicken on me to get information

17:20.340 --> 17:23.940
just as you begin some

17:23.940 --> 17:25.620
no

17:25.620 --> 17:26.900
not at all

17:26.900 --> 17:28.340
here at the

17:28.340 --> 17:31.740
america one day and that was the fact that he said it put out for information

17:31.740 --> 17:34.700
about dvd are i think that i put out there

17:34.700 --> 17:36.980

17:48.380 --> 17:53.020

17:53.020 --> 17:54.780
on over there

17:54.780 --> 17:58.420

18:29.380 --> 18:32.100
okay so here that i'm picturing from the eric stream

18:32.100 --> 18:36.980
brand extreme clips in the background possibly people doing extreme date

18:36.980 --> 18:41.380
there's going to be extreme size and i'm going to get extremely bored with this

18:41.380 --> 18:42.620
but any

18:42.620 --> 18:44.140
a ways that they had a

18:44.140 --> 18:48.060
a little voting thing going on that we mentioned last week and i've seen some

18:48.060 --> 18:49.040
of them

18:49.040 --> 18:53.300
and someone who had to do it in florida there are no songs by extreme

18:53.300 --> 18:54.780
they went out and i have

18:54.780 --> 18:55.900
how about it

18:55.900 --> 18:58.220
let me guess i'm just gonna throw out

18:58.220 --> 18:59.600
an idea here

18:59.600 --> 19:01.480
could the next max b

19:01.480 --> 19:04.100
max extreme uh...

19:04.100 --> 19:06.220
uh...

19:06.220 --> 19:07.300
they don't know

19:07.300 --> 19:12.020
it's the remix of max three hundred by erotic max extreme

19:12.020 --> 19:15.780
old backs but but but but don't have sex

19:15.780 --> 19:19.320
i'll be there would be fucking sweet and i don't know if that's correct

19:19.320 --> 19:22.560
people to do that so i don't know

19:22.560 --> 19:23.360
but anyway

19:23.360 --> 19:27.080
uh... yes it's a very thought that they're mentioning there were no out

19:27.080 --> 19:27.920
there

19:27.920 --> 19:30.880
they're possibly going to be in there not confirmed to be in there but

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
possibly

19:31.880 --> 19:33.860
uh... sees there with that the mania

19:33.860 --> 19:36.520
uh... to the ex you've got to be in a

19:36.520 --> 19:37.820
fuck you lucky by the way

19:37.820 --> 19:39.920
which together is in the a

19:39.920 --> 19:43.200
uh... for the veterans or something i don't know

19:43.200 --> 19:46.640
anyways uh... let's see there is a very perfect is the least one hundred

19:46.640 --> 19:48.900
seconds and

19:48.900 --> 19:50.420
and something else

19:50.420 --> 19:52.980
that's not fire or jet world because i really will

19:52.980 --> 19:56.600
narrow i wanted to know about it and sweet

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
uh...

19:57.600 --> 20:00.460
there is a hold on me from uh...

20:00.460 --> 20:04.360
with a pair of hair which everyone's just like this is crap

20:04.360 --> 20:07.200
which i agree i rather had i mean

20:07.200 --> 20:09.320
even like a number of rock

20:09.320 --> 20:11.420
thinking about king of iraq would be awesome

20:11.420 --> 20:15.080
king of iraq you're even like a burning desire

20:15.080 --> 20:18.960
deluxe pocket deluxe india are not rule

20:18.960 --> 20:19.880
maybe not

20:19.880 --> 20:22.440
uh... in the in the microphone

20:22.440 --> 20:25.960
that's like the only be if they know i look so gay doing it

20:25.960 --> 20:27.200
do we have a lot

20:27.200 --> 20:28.300
okay well first

20:28.300 --> 20:31.680
first up just because these you know became a nice these were on you know

20:31.680 --> 20:32.880
top of the list here

20:32.880 --> 20:35.800
doesn't mean that they're not going to throw this stuff in there so i mean

20:35.800 --> 20:39.140
It's very possible. I would be happy if Cosmic Cowgirl was in Max.

20:39.140 --> 20:44.760
So I wonder, I wonder how long this DDR Extreme is going to last. I mean, and what...

20:44.760 --> 20:45.620
One week.

20:45.620 --> 20:50.680
It's just because I think they changed interface designs. One week since this game came out.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.600
One week since I looked at it.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.720
The question is,

20:53.720 --> 20:57.680
how often will it be bootlegged? Will it be a bigger or more rampant bootleg than

20:57.680 --> 20:59.340
Mootleg?

20:59.340 --> 21:04.680
Meant than Max 2 or? I was born for radio.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.440
well we're having a discussion in the dee dee or i mean the extra room today

21:08.440 --> 21:09.320
person that they

21:09.320 --> 21:13.180
i'd all our friends in the d r maniacs chattel

21:13.180 --> 21:15.060
and love ya

21:15.060 --> 21:16.460
uh... sorry if you

21:16.460 --> 21:17.600
i'm not

21:17.600 --> 21:18.740
uh... we've

21:18.740 --> 21:25.740
we've got lots of fans over there going

21:25.740 --> 21:26.800
we have you

21:26.800 --> 21:31.300
and your other body is always speaking to the one fan

21:31.300 --> 21:38.300
Talking to him today, and we were discussing the fact that DDR Extreme, since it is so extreme, should have a fog machine and lasers.

21:38.300 --> 21:41.300
Because who doesn't like a good laser?

21:41.300 --> 21:45.300
As I said earlier on another chat board, I said it should be...

21:45.300 --> 21:47.300
This is kind of a joke I used earlier, but I don't care, it's still funny.

21:47.300 --> 21:54.300
DDR sex stream, with a big pole in the middle, and all erotic set of songs.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.300
Remember what I was saying the other night?

21:55.300 --> 21:56.300
What?

21:56.300 --> 21:58.300
That it needs the butt pads, you can have booty mode.

21:58.300 --> 22:02.820
Yeah, they're good. They're gonna put a button on the bar. So you could like rub your ass against the bar

22:03.900 --> 22:08.020
Well, who daddy and my baby mama? We need the grind. What were you saying JB?

22:12.060 --> 22:16.300
Actually what they're gonna do is they're gonna have a nice little chair in front of the

22:16.860 --> 22:20.060
The pads itself and sitting on the chair will be a mannequin

22:20.060 --> 22:23.300
So you bump and grind against the mannequin to get some bonus points there

22:23.300 --> 22:28.300
And it's going to be one of those real dolls of Maoki.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.300
And it's got session mode with a boonga boonga.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.300
Ahhhhh!

22:33.300 --> 22:42.300
Actually, what's scary is he'll be probably sneaking himself into one of these DDR6 stream machines.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.300
Since, you know, no one will be able to tell the difference.

22:45.300 --> 22:49.300
Since the real dolls are supposed to be hard to tell from the real thing except they don't blink or move.

22:49.300 --> 22:55.300
Yeah, you know what's scary? So I heard on the news today that, uh, Michael Jackson abuses his monkey.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.300
Yeah, I heard that-

22:56.300 --> 22:58.300
EEEEEE!

22:58.300 --> 22:59.300
AHH!

22:59.300 --> 23:01.300
I don't like when he messes with his monkey.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.300
Does his monkey fling poo?

23:03.300 --> 23:04.300
Maybe, you know, uh-

23:04.300 --> 23:06.300
I think Michael Jackson should be beating his monkey anywhere.

23:06.300 --> 23:11.300
For those of you that heard Dance Maniacs 8, lovely, pathetic cover of, uh-

23:11.300 --> 23:15.300
That was kind of, uh, contradictory, wasn't it? I don't know how else to describe it.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
I'd like to see that in DDR, just for laughs.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.300
Just for laughs.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.300
I'm still...

23:19.300 --> 23:21.300
Well, with DDR6 stream, that would definitely fit.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.300
Beat it!

23:23.300 --> 23:25.300
Beat it!

23:25.300 --> 23:27.300
I can just see...

23:27.300 --> 23:29.300
No, here's the kit and have it.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.300
You can either have Beat It by DJ Alligator Project or Erotic.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.300
Erotic.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.300
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.

23:35.300 --> 23:39.300
That's my watch.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.300
It says, this will explode.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
This watch has the time of day.

23:43.300 --> 23:48.060
this watch has the time of your doom. It's my 007 watch. It's the doomsday clock.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.340
They gave out to all the managers of GameStop. 11.59 and ticking.

23:51.340 --> 23:55.480
I don't know. Right, honey? And the time

23:55.480 --> 24:01.380
is 0.59. Time to die. Oh, no. Oh, what nerds are we?

24:01.380 --> 24:07.060
So, what other cool things can we expect to see in DDR Extreme?

24:07.060 --> 24:11.500
Oh, yes, JB? In the DDR Extreme.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
What about Gillette?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
Don't want no short dick, man.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.500
You remember that song?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.500
Maybe I'm going to play that during one of the breaks.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
If I remember when I'm putting this show together,

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
when I get back home and editing it,

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
I'll put Gillette as one of the songs we'll play.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
What about what?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.500
Tonight's a good song. I'll try to play that for you if I remember.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
There's the one song that I definitely want played.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
What's that?

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
Children of the Sandstorm.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
Now explain this mix.

24:37.500 --> 24:42.800
I was going, I was looking for a sandstorm because I actually did not have it on my computer.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.800
You just couldn't get enough of last week's joke.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.800
It was Sunday night after I got home.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.800
And I found, um, for people who are familiar with it, um, Robert Miles did a song called Children.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.800
And I found that mixed with sandstorm.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.000
That was actually pretty nice.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.800
That was a huge song when I was in high school. It makes me feel so old.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
It was a good mix.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.800
I mean, it was basically cut and paste type, but it was done very smoothly.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
Oh, JB left you a present, by the way.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
Yeah, I left you a present.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.800
Oh, JB, explain the present that you left for Jamie.

25:11.800 --> 25:16.800
Okay, it was Dynamite R5.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.800
And explain, tell us a little bit about Dynamite R5.

25:19.800 --> 25:23.800
Um, it's Dynamite Rave and R5 mixed together.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.800
Excellent, very good, yes!

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
I must listen to this right away.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.800
Yes, Golf Land, we are in the gazebo overlooking the lovely course here.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.800
I see, this is beautiful, we've got a castle right in front of us.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.800
And we're not at Golf Land, wow.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.800
Thank God.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
Assholes.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
And their stuff's messed up.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.800
Hey, Initial D took my money, but I'm addicted to that game.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
Okay, fuck the money for a second, I want to talk about Initial D.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.800
Oh wait, look, you have something to say?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
Um...

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
Yeah, I'm guessing we'll hear it.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.800
Supposedly what's going to be happening week to week with Naoki.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.800
I love that song.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.800
Oh, that's right, another song was announced for DVR Extreme.

26:02.800 --> 26:10.360
Um, this is gonna be a new Ryu whatever her damn name is Kosaka or I blow now. Yeah, I blow Naoki Rui Rui blow

26:10.360 --> 26:11.800
Naoki

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
She's doing a song that's called

26:15.480 --> 26:22.300
Shit, I don't know whatever it's some stupid shit, whatever it's gonna be like candy, but it's supposed to be heavy metal or rock

26:22.300 --> 26:24.300
or some crap like that.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.300
Weh weh weh.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.300
Weh weh weh.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.300
Weh.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.300
Weh.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.300
Weh.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.300
Anyways, just keep going.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.300
I'm going to run in and see if anyone else shows up.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.300
So, yeah.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.300
Naoki's Journal sucks.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.300
They're supposed to be doing some interviews or questionnaires with the staff.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.300
They're like, we give a shit.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.300
Let's see what the staff thinks about DDR Extreme.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.300
They're probably all going to say, uh, Naoki's gay.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.300
DDR.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.300
So, um, let's see here.

26:50.300 --> 26:54.300
And meanwhile over here, you're hearing voices.

26:54.300 --> 26:58.300
Yes! I keep hearing somebody saying my name, and it's not JB!

26:58.300 --> 27:01.300
No, they're going, Big Fuck! Big Fuck!

27:01.300 --> 27:03.300
It just sounds like it.

27:03.300 --> 27:06.300
Well, since we have this big gap of space here,

27:06.300 --> 27:09.300
I'm going to go ahead and do the sim update for this week.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.300
And we actually have news this week, which is pretty cool.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
And it's my turn to excuse myself. Take the mic.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.300
Okay.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.300
So, here's what's going on in the sim world here.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.500
First off, you have a new release of StepMania.

27:21.500 --> 27:29.300
StepMania, actually, it's kind of been called, it's Beta 6 Release 2, or what they're calling it is Beta 7.

27:29.300 --> 27:37.800
And, um, so Beta 7's out now. I've got it at home, I haven't gotten to try it out yet, but, you know, StepMania hasn't disappointed me yet.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.800
My StepMania doesn't work on my computer.

27:39.800 --> 27:44.300
You used to not like StepMania back in the early versions. You're a liar! You're a liar!

27:44.300 --> 27:53.300
Alright, okay, SetMania really did disappoint me back in the version 1.6, 1.6.5, that area,

27:53.300 --> 27:59.300
because it didn't load, and it sucked, and it was really slow, and it was a piece of shit, and DWI kicked his ass.

27:59.300 --> 28:05.300
However, since then, since they've gone actually doing, like, public updates, you know, where there's, like,

28:05.300 --> 28:09.300
you know, 30 people working on updating this thing instead of two, it's gotten a lot better.

28:09.300 --> 28:14.180
better so you've got now you have pump support para para support you also have

28:14.180 --> 28:19.620
easy to dancer support in there so that's kind of cool which means what

28:19.620 --> 28:25.380
which means you can play those games on that simulator okay not everybody knows

28:25.380 --> 28:33.260
that well she didn't know Derek's a little slow no I'm fat and I didn't eat

28:33.260 --> 28:39.100
today anyways other than that let's see on a personal note I'm putting up

28:39.100 --> 28:43.700
off DWIs on the internet. I've actually got my own site that's going to be started here

28:43.700 --> 28:44.960
pretty soon.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
LeechFromLoki.com.

28:45.960 --> 28:50.360
Hey, you know what? That's not a bad name.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.360
Hyrule.

28:51.360 --> 28:57.880
I'm going to call that Leech From Loki. It's awesome though because I found a site, it's

28:57.880 --> 29:02.500
like gamers.com or some shit like that, or gamers club I believe is what it's called.

29:02.500 --> 29:07.640
It's 50 megs of web space free and unlimited bandwidth.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.640
I love it.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.000
bandwidth. Shit, I could put stuff on there. Don't want to worry about my site going down.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.720
It's awesome.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.180
That's super orgasmic.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.040
So I'm gonna have

29:15.040 --> 29:20.000
I'm gonna have my DWIs on there. Plus, really hard to find a rare, like, 8-style DWIs in my...

29:20.000 --> 29:20.820
It's free, right?

29:20.820 --> 29:21.960
Yeah, it's free.

29:21.960 --> 29:27.960
So it's pretty cool. I'll be doing that. Maybe get a couple of sites if I run out of my 50 megs.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.480
You run out of space?

29:29.480 --> 29:31.100
That kind of stuff. So, um...

29:31.100 --> 29:33.860
No, look for that pretty soon. I'll announce it later on.

29:33.860 --> 29:36.480
Do they bog you down with banner ads or any of that crap?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.520
Unfortunately, yes. They do.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.080
playing is ever really free

29:41.080 --> 29:45.480
mozilla dot com highly recommended by orange launch staff block ads

29:45.480 --> 29:48.680
awesome love it

29:48.680 --> 29:52.280
sounds good ball for the link to that on my site i'm sure they won't like it but

29:52.280 --> 29:55.060
i'll probably get there so

29:55.060 --> 29:57.280
now i have that and uh...

29:57.280 --> 29:59.000
see other than that

29:59.000 --> 30:02.880
i'm not too much going on the same world more people releasing stuff of your mix

30:02.880 --> 30:05.360
that he got the i think i'm not pretty good on that

30:05.360 --> 30:08.580
d r u k they've actually got now the official backgrounds for his area two

30:08.580 --> 30:11.860
thousand one in before you out before the beat mix which is

30:11.860 --> 30:13.600
pretty cool looking uh...

30:13.600 --> 30:16.240
and also to be adding the uh...

30:16.240 --> 30:18.380
rest of the debate including

30:18.380 --> 30:20.320
caribbean queen

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320

family

30:24.660 --> 30:25.900
that

30:25.900 --> 30:27.780
okay with itself

30:27.780 --> 30:31.040
no more anything

30:31.040 --> 30:33.480
but uh...

30:33.480 --> 30:34.660
all right uh...

30:34.660 --> 30:37.680
so we do an interview some guesses that are just a bit

30:37.680 --> 30:41.720

30:50.420 --> 30:54.020

30:54.020 --> 30:54.980

34:39.360 --> 34:42.480

34:42.480 --> 34:46.520
she's a shermy

34:46.520 --> 34:47.900
it's a she

34:47.900 --> 34:49.900
You're just digging yourself deeper tonight.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.900
It's a little grey cat.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.900
She looks like Church from Pet Sematary.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.900
Oh, that's actually a good point.

34:56.900 --> 34:57.900
You never saw Pet Sematary.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.900
I was afraid of it. It was a scary movie.

34:59.900 --> 35:00.900
What?

35:00.900 --> 35:02.900
That was a pretty child's play.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.900
That movie freaked the shit out of me.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.900
I don't like little daddy doll things.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.900
I was scared of the Wizard of Oz.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.900
Wait a minute, you were scared of the Wizard of Oz?

35:10.900 --> 35:11.900
Why?

35:11.900 --> 35:13.900
The little gnome things.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.900
The monkeys that fly on the...

35:15.900 --> 35:18.900
The Munch Kids that fly out of their ass?

35:18.900 --> 35:21.900
No, it's the lollipop kids.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.900
The Munch Kids.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.900
Did you ever see the great sequel Return to Oz?

35:26.900 --> 35:28.900
With the thing on the wheels?

35:28.900 --> 35:29.900
Dude, no.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.900
You're thinking of the Wiz.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.900
No, Return to Oz was good.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.900
The reason why Return to Oz was good is because it was actually based off of the book.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.900
Yes, and Verusa Bach was in it and she's cool.

35:40.900 --> 35:46.900
The Wizard of Oz was not true to the book, because she went and met all of the witches.

35:46.900 --> 35:53.900
She met the Good Witch of the North, the Good Witch of the South, killed one of them, and then killed the other.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.900
So there was no balance, and Oz fell into ruin.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.900
I remember the freakiest scene in Return to Oz, with all the little heads in the jar.

36:01.900 --> 36:02.900
That was so cool.

36:02.900 --> 36:03.900
That was awesome.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.900
Oh, I'm sorry, but money what?

36:05.900 --> 36:09.900
This is Random Night on Orange Lounge, you heard it here first.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.900
You heard it here first.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.900
Oh, you know something we brought up earlier?

36:11.900 --> 36:12.900

36:12.900 --> 36:13.900
Oh, ass!

36:13.900 --> 36:14.900
No, not ass.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.580

36:18.580 --> 36:19.580

memory card. I don't know.

37:44.340 --> 37:48.540
For a PS2. Not for a PS2, for a PlayStation.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.460
You win a Dark Sakura autographed memory card.

37:52.460 --> 37:55.860
Here's your first clue.

37:55.860 --> 38:00.740
You get two clues. And they're pretty easy clues if you know how to find it.

38:00.740 --> 38:04.500
The password is...

38:04.500 --> 38:07.860
The first clue is that the word is Greek.

38:07.860 --> 38:11.260
Second clue... Now, wait a minute. Didn't they ban video games in Greece?

38:11.260 --> 38:14.300
Fuck Greece. By the way, they overruled that.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.860
Oh. The second rule

38:15.860 --> 38:18.580
is that it means goal.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.180
Mmm.

38:20.180 --> 38:22.940
Goal!

38:22.940 --> 38:26.300

a whoever can guess what it will be leveraging gets with the word is

38:37.500 --> 38:40.500
there was not there that i made it

38:40.500 --> 38:43.940

54:04.520 --> 54:08.520
A notepad.

54:08.520 --> 54:12.520
Honestly, there is not a notepad in my purse. I took it out this morning.

54:12.520 --> 54:15.520
No, I took it out when I wrote the rules to freestyle.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.520

54:34.520 --> 54:35.520
Does that count?

54:35.520 --> 54:38.920
It's not really a bar. It's cylindrical, but it's kind of smushed. So now it's a bar

54:39.920 --> 54:40.920
Okay

54:40.920 --> 54:45.520
Last up Loki now hasn't guessed Loki. We're playing guess. What's in Jamie's purse?

56:20.520 --> 56:22.480

but there's another one

56:51.300 --> 56:53.140
where it flips around

56:53.140 --> 56:56.220
and like at certain times you'll get the evil picture of the demon and there's

56:56.220 --> 56:58.320

Hey, and remember, Mr. T supports Shaft,

59:26.640 --> 59:30.640
he pities the foo-hoo who don't go to Shaft. He's on the site with his orange afro.

59:30.640 --> 59:34.640
You know what, maybe you ought to ask an incentive, an extra

59:34.640 --> 59:38.640
tenth of a point to anyone who dresses up. Alright, people will get

59:38.640 --> 59:42.640
an extra tenth of a percentile point added if they

59:42.640 --> 59:49.600
have the following items. They dress up like an A-Team member or they wear an orange afro.

59:49.600 --> 59:59.600
Okay. Only orange? Stand by to win. Wow. No. What about red? Orange. Why? Because it's

59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.800
the Wow Wow 70s. And Orange Lounge is sponsoring the tournament. Or you know if you wear a

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:13.560

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.480
uh... basically

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.120
just to go ahead and give a brief recap we're going to have a freestyle on

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.360
both machines

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.160
So, for all of you people who are listening on Sunday in the future for us and the current day for you,

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.360
we are going to be running fourth mix freestyle first,

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.660
so make sure that you decide on your song at registration or pre-registration

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.260
so that we can make sure that we have the machine set up for you.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.860
You know, there's going to be no changing your mind once we get to the machine

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.360
unless the song happens to be in that machine.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.060
You lay down the law.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.700
Damn straight, or damn gay.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.700
One of them too?

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.700
What?

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.700
Dan Skippy!

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.300
One other thing we should talk about, Shaft.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.940
We're going to have door prizes out the ass at Shaft, and a lot of that's going to be

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:25.300
thanks to the big Shaft right here.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.300
Matt himself.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:30.140
Tell us about some of the lovely door prizes people can expect to see at Shaft.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:35.780
You can expect to see a whole bunch of DVDs provided by ADV Films.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.780
Yes, lots and lots of DVDs to be had.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.780
Lots and lots of DVDs.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.780
Are you bribing people to come?

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.780
No, but there will be lots and lots of DVDs.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.780
Lots and lots and lots of...

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.780
Now what about tapes for those people living in the Dark Ages still?

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780
Uh...

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.780
Lots of DVDs.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.780
I suppose I could provide some tapes.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.780
I think we can do that.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.780
But you shouldn't be living in the Dark Ages.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.780
Come out.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.560
I want a laser disc.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.000
Come out and get some Shaft.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.800
Come to Shaft.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.520
Mr. T ate my balls.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.280
So that's why it was singing Take Me Higher.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.400
Take me higher.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.720
Hey, we were talking about Maimani.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.120
We were talking about Shaft.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.840
We can shake it.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.840
Anything else you want to talk about, Shaft?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.120
We are having special prizes.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.120
They are secret prizes. Only Rob and I know what they are. Remember?

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.120
We know what the prize is. Shut up!

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.120
Oh yes, uh huh. Big prizes. You're going to want them.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.120
We are also going to be having a demonstration the day of tournament.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120
Are these door prizes?

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120
These are actual winning prizes.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:00.120
Door? Damn it! Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it. I want door prizes.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:05.120
But we are going to also be having a special secret demo that day.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.120
There's going to be a special demo setup of something secret.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.120
Yes.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.120
Something happy?

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.120
Something super! Something extreme!

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.120
Shut up!

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.120
No, we're not telling, so don't even...

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120
Don't guess.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.120
Oh, I wasn't going to guess.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.120
Oh, okay.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.120
I was going to say about that new GDR, if you notice the logo, it's...

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120
It's spelled irk stream

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.880
Not extreme the R is before the X look at the logo DDR irk stream actually

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.500
Yeah, it is the prescription symbol the R and the X cross. It's a drug game. They're promoting drug usage. Oh shit

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960
They're promoting drug use

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
They're pointing to the Ray bars

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.560
You are like shit look at this. It's a clown door. It's a little penny door

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.760
Okay train wreck radio

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.600
That was a car.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
Back to shaft.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Shut yo mouth.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
Ugh, it feels so good Jamie.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
I'm sorry.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600
Ah!

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.080
Anyway, back to shaft.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:09.200
We are also planning, assuming that I can find one, we are having special trophies for

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.280
our 18 freestyle winners.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280
Ooh.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280
Ah.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:18.760
We are going to have, as a trophy, secret prizes.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Well, we could, you know, I mean I'm sure I'll be able to provide like, you know, bronze replicas of certain things if you need, need for that.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.760
Oh my God.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760
What kind of job are you running on the side, Mookie?

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Winter, get the gold shaft!

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.760
We give him a cold picture of Samuel.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.760
I hate Orange Lounge Radio. All they ever do is tell potty jokes.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.760
Pencils rage!

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.760
Anyway, so all of you have to come to Shaft or I'll hunt you down and kick your ass.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.760
You remember, I know where you live, I saw it on the internet.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.760
Ha ha ha ha.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.760
Let's change gears completely, if you don't turn around Shaft.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.760
I want to talk about another game I just got to play for the first time yesterday.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.760
Drummania seventh mix.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.760
8th Mix is.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.760
Ewwww.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.760
And here's our other Universal Fuck Universal Golf Plan.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.760
Fight our ass.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.480
It's fun.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.280
Was there anything that you enjoyed about Drummania 7th Mix?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.600
I enjoyed playing Another World, but I hated that it wasn't Gax singing it.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.160
I'm glad I can actually pass a song now.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.960
Breakdown owned me.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.440
Breakdown the video to Breakdown rules.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.240
It's a little girl voice.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.580
It's so cute.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.100
It's like, well think about the how to spring video where you had a little panda, that was

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100
cool too.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100
Oh, pandas are cool.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.700
Okay, well you know all the girls doing doo doo doo doo doo, that that's not cool.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.780
What's wrong with you?

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.780
I like animals.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.940
They did put in a new panda song in there though.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.940
Hello.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.860
There's the one that's got the heart in the front and the back, I don't know what it says,

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.860
do you know the name of it?

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:57.860
No I don't.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.660
And Bradley doesn't know the name of it, nobody does.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:04.820
It's got a girl writing on like a silver surfer board type thing and there's two pandas flying

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.820
with her.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:06.820
It's pretty neat.

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.820
Silver Surfer was cool.

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.820
What? I'm not talking about Silver Surfer.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820
Nerd.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.820
You said the Silver Surfer!

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.820
Nerd.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.820
So.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.820
Nerd.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.820
So.

01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.820
Nerd.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.820
So.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.820
Dork.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.820
So.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.820
Okay.

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:22.820
This is great radio, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:23.820
I hate Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.820
All they ever do is fight.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.820
Dear Diary, I listened to this show today called Orange Lounge.

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.820
First of all, I hate Orange Lounge.

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.820
Those little girls are stealing all of my fender.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.820
Oh, wait.

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.820
That's the radio show and not the...

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.820
Dear diary, today I've got a new hairdo.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.820
Loki wants to say something.

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.820
Dear diary, kill me now. Oh, yes.

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:51.820
Totally off the topic here, but on the fourth mix, fellatio, it almost owned me.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:53.820
Fellatio?

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.820
Fellatio almost owned me, there.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.820
Everybody knows.

01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.820
Fellatio what?

01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.820
But I kicked pink taco's ass.

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.820
Well, fellatio always owns me.

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:08.460
Yeah. What do you think about that?

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.540
I think. They're full. I feel.

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:15.740
Um.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.100
Oh shit. You know what? I'm not doing that.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.900
It's gonna be me.

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.180
I'm gonna get hit. My idea of what can make this show better,

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.220
let's all get drunk and then do it. Oh my God. We're actually

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.220
planning a drunk show. Whenever the next three day weekend is

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.660
We're doing the drunk show. I don't know when that is for Jamie and I when we both have a holiday

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:40.140
We'll find one. It's gonna make one if we have to

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.380
We're getting eggnog it's still eggnog radio

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.920
Because it's got dairy crap in it. Well, then you can just drink tequila

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.900
We'll give you a whiskey enema I drank last night I had I had red

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.620

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:08.460
really good that sounds gross red they call it a pebble it was it or is pebbles

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.620

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:17.220

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.380
There's flowers in the background and look, I'm Sinead O'Connor and I'm dancing.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.940
I didn't see the reflex, but I saw View to a Kill.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.740

You want to go play After Burner?

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.680

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.200

move back out, yep back out of the way a little

01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:18.020
Look how the monitor totally bends at a 45 degree angle when she plays.

01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:21.020
This game kicks Beachhead's 2000s ass.

01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:29.020
But it doesn't have the cool bubble for the sumo, like sumo ass.

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.020
True, that's true. It's not sumo, but it's old school Sega.

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.020
Super, recording their songs and shit.

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.020
Nah, fuck em.

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.020
We play it for money, we just gotta work on it.

01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.020
It's free promotion.

01:43:47.020 --> 01:44:14.460
Oh, she's reloading.

01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.980
Super zapper recharge.

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:23.660

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:26.460
how come the machine doesn't do loop-de-loop so she does

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:30.940
how come the machine doesn't blow up so she does?

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.300
how did it feel? was it the rest of your life?

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.460
dude retro gaming owns

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:38.020

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:39.600

01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:51.220
Hey, Matt, something.

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.180
Low-key lesson of the day.

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.260
Don't drink 44 ounces of Hep C and play Cata Doubles all day.

01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:00.980
How about don't go eat a bunch of Mongolian barbecue

01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:02.660
and then play three eight-footers in a row?

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.260
I can't play double Cata's anyways.

01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:06.220
Last time I was here, I had just gotten an eating mongo

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.660
chow, and I played Superstar, Pollock, and Spin the Disc

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:11.300
all in a row.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.460
Maybe I should get some Mike's Heart of Lemonade

01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:16.140
because I think an alien's going to pop out of my chest.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:22.100
Good just you know as long as you're actually a real person and not like a city drink like 12 of them in an hour

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:27.180
You look really and for the truck right now. Loki is our sweat elemental

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:33.420
I thought I know what's going to fly. Oh, yes. He's he's going

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.880
I hope that this has actually sounds today

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:41.140
I've never played this game in my I'd like to stipulate. I've never played this game in my entire life points

01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:47.780

Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, there's a dude on the roof. You should have killed him

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:56.660
Don't run that gives you more time. We'll get the shiny balloons map

01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:01.660
For the record, Rob is owning at this game for his first time.

01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:06.660
He's got an eight perfect balloon run.

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.660
He just got two and one.

01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.660
Turn around, you've got one balloon.

01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.660
You need to get six.

01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:11.660
You need to get six more balloons.

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.660
What?

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:14.660
Shit.

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:16.660
Go in the hole.

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:17.660
This is such crap.

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.660
Go down.

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:20.660
Go down under the waterfall.

01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:21.660
Go down.

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.660
Here he goes.

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.660
He's going down, folks.

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.660
Shit, I missed it.

01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:27.660
That's okay, you've got more stuff here.

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.660
Ooh, get the pink one!

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.660
What's that one?

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.660
Rob goes for 20 for 10 seconds.

01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.660
And he has increased his time.

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:37.660
He has...

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.660
So far his score is a whopping...

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.660
He has 12,100...

01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:43.660
No, that's 2,150 points.

01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:44.660
Wow, we can't read.

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.660
And now he's out of the cave.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.660
And he's going into the tent.

01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.660
I'm flying!

01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.660
I'm flying!

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.660
Now he comes out of the tent.

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:57.660
Oh, I was whomped.

01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:58.660
I was whomped.

01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.660
No, you can't say that's another inside joke with the white boys.

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:02.660
Here we go.

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:03.660
Ooh, hit that shit.

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:04.660
Go faster.

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.660
Get it, it's 500, it's 500.

01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:07.660
No, it's 200, I can't read.

01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:09.660
Ooh, there's another one.

01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.660
Ooh, you got it.

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:11.660
You got four more balloons.

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.660
Yeah, Rob's going to crash.

01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:15.660
That's a wall.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.660
Oh, shit.

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.660
Yes, this game is brought to you by Doom Honor.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.660
This game is brought to you by Oh Shit.

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.660
No, it's Namco.

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.260
a fan what's-his-name? Remember, Namco owns your soul

01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:31.980
I died. So what do you think of Prop Cycle? That was actually pretty- oh dude it shows

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.660
I had no sense of direction. Pop 4 Balloons

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:40.980
and Rob got Wing Leader for his first time that is not bad

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:44.740
That's like third place music. That was kind of fun. It would have been better if the game actually had sound

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:49.860
because I'll tell you that was like the worst radio ever. Uh oh

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.900
Matt's gonna play- dude don't you have to pee? Dude wait wait

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:59.900
Missile command. Centipede. Millipede. Remember, what is centipede and millipede famous for?

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:04.900
The one sound. That's your one-up noise.

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:09.900
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's the difference between centipede and millipede?

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.900
I don't remember.

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.900
There's a punching bag game on the trees.

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.900
Hey, what's the difference between centipede and millipede?

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.900
Millipede is faster and harder and it's longer.

01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:18.900
Like Shaft?

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.900
It's faster, harder, and longer, just like Shaft.

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:32.900
Okay. As Matt goes for, ooh, the hard level. The solitaire. Oh, dude, that dude has wings.

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:36.900
Brought to you by him. And he is going for it with a vengeance.

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:42.900
One hundred. And another hundred. Ooh, a choo-choo train. And a train. A choo-choo.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.900
Train wreck radio. I remember this level being really hard. What the hell? That's a...

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:54.060
to dive through the hole. And he got it the one that was in the hole. And now he's heading

01:49:54.060 --> 01:50:01.060
into the cave. Loki go down the hole. I want to flush the body. What happens when he gets

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:08.400
a thousand right there? Oh he almost. And now he is in the subway. Getting hit by. Running

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.000
into polls this game is full of polls and holes

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.960
holes and holes

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:22.800
and he's got another 10 seconds but he's only got 31 left

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.240
what's the thousand mean what thousand the thousand below his score

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.720
that's lovely

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.960
wow he's kind of good at this game

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.960
He advanced one day. Day one.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.960
Day? Whoa, he's been flying for a whole day, folks.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.960
And he's chasing another balloon around a girder, and he decided not to go at it.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:52.960
He's going into another hole.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.960
It's just me. It's me, Mario. No, you're not Mario.

01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:00.960
Not Mario! Mario! See, I told you. Whoa, shit.

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:04.960
Dude, that chick would kick my ass. And he got another ten seconds and ran into a wall.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.520
and i want to hear about your ass and apparently you cannot knock down the people that are in the

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:16.080

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.880
two points for one play on this game i think that's we got 1400 points he completed the level

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:29.760
and he gets an ending no dude that's coffee man joe hey it's rio from the i made it dude

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.200
the guy in prop cycle looks like rio from digimon oh no he's now going to day two

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.760
i didn't get day two you didn't get enough points you no actually he did

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.600
he did the first thing where you only play once

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:52.880
these people are scaring me i don't see exactly how this goddamn punching bag game oh there it is

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.880
It pops down.

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.880
So are we ready to close the show?

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.880
I don't know. Where's the clock?

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.880
Dude, we have like another minute and a half to fill.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.880
Oh.

Last segment five minutes earlier.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.880
Oh, that's right.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.880
This is such awful radio.

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.880
What can we do that's exciting for listeners?

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.880
Strip!

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.880
Let's start streaking through Scandinavia.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.880
Let's see who gets caught first.

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.880
Then we're sure not to have Turney here.

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:26.080

Alrighty. Wow. I want to see what a weakling I am. I'm going to get more tokens, okay?

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:59.720
Let's go ahead and do the...you know there's two centipede machines here.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.720
Let's walk around and poke at stuff.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.720
Alright. Well, everyone heard After Burner, which I played because I'm cool.

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:10.720
We have centipede. We have one of the best shooter games ever, Raiden Fighter.

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.720
Oh dude, you can buy this shit for a thousand bucks.

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:16.720
Wow, a thousand for centipede. I can play it on my Atari 5200 at home.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.120
So we have we got a Harley game

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.280

no that's 4

01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.480
not 4 with a hyped

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:01.000
which reminds me the very first place i ever played golden tea

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.640
was a little ghettocade in roseville called supercade

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:09.960
supercade closed this this month the guy retired a moment of silence for supercade

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:12.960

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.120
i want to talk with the see what a weakling i am

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.980
right everybody

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.280
or to create a nice thing

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.120
patient yesterday our battles

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.960
you know that's the main thing

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.440
rockman

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.040
no actually permanent now that they came in and i don't know i know i know i

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:37.160
know i think i think he's gonna punch this into this

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:39.280
let's see what is the economy

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.440
On the meter is, he hit 290.

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:47.520
Okay, he gets to hit it again.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.600
290.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:52.720
I think Rob gets one more try.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:54.880
Dude, you didn't even get a rating.

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.680
Rob did not register.

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:58.760
Let me try.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.060
Rob's gonna give me money to play.

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:06.000
Who holds what? I'm gonna probably get really bad.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.160
If you do better than Rob, you get to autograph something for yourself.

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.060
Alright, here's the microphone.

01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:12.760
Okay, here we go. Jamie's gonna...

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.180
She's gonna show off what a stud she is.

01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:16.640
Here she goes. Uh-oh.

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:17.780
She's revving up.

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:23.140
Oh, cracking her knuckles? Oh, cracking her knuckles.

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:26.740
Here she goes.

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:30.180
She also got 290. You know, I think 290 is what you get when you hit it so weak

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.220
it didn't even register.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:34.220
Try again. Try again, Jamie.

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.260
Don't let that scary off.

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.580
How many times did you put... How many points did you put in?

01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.780
I put one.

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.200
so i try one more

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:40.980
right now we go

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:44.100

01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.160
right here we go

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.120

Lots of the lights are out, but they all light up.

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.220
You know, I think this machine is just fucked up.

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:32.220
Hmm, Roseville, anyone?

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.220
We'll have to tell Keith to fix this machine.

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.220
Okay.
