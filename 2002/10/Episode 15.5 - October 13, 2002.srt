[SPEAKER_18]: Our live talk program begins now.

00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:24,905
Boring!

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,952

[SPEAKER_12]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:55,574
[SPEAKER_12]: The galaxy is at peace.

14
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.

15
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:15,218
[SPEAKER_00]: My kind of people and assholes.

16
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,319
[SPEAKER_00]: One.

17
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,040
[SPEAKER_19]: One.

18
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:23,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

19
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:23,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like

20
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:57,220
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Sky, Orange Lounge Radio

21
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,853
[SPEAKER_04]: But you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

22
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:24,955
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 15 and a half for this October the 13th, I think.

23
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No, today's the 10th.

24
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's the 10th.

25
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I spent all day writing the 10th.

26
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:31,896
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taping on Thursday, so let me do the math real fast.

27
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:33,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the 13th.

28
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,696
[SPEAKER_04]: 13th of October.

29
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to a pre-taped show.

30
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

31
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Jamie and I are lazy.

32
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,317
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to take a weekend off.

33
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: We want a weekend off.

34
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:45,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce for everybody out there, by the way, if you don't know her, you should.

35
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Jamie Summers, ladies and gentlemen.

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's a first for this show.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's usually me on Under Sedation Live.

38
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,861
[SPEAKER_13]: That burp was brought to you by Berry Flavored Propel, a product of Gatorade.

[SPEAKER_13]: You can find out more about Propel at www.GatoradeSucksButPropelOwnsMe.com It's going to be one of those shows, I can already tell.

40
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,383
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

41
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,164
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know me also as Skye.

42
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:12,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know you.

43
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you do!

44
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,034
[SPEAKER_13]: You think you know me.

45
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,495
[SPEAKER_13]: You will never know me.

46
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:19,536
[SPEAKER_13]: You are lost and scared.

47
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just a puppet.

48
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish?

51
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it was an obscure wrestling reference, you know.

52
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually we'd be taking a break right now for the opening of the show, but we're not.

53
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to kick right into things, start off the show here.

54
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce everybody who's here.

55
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,851
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a nice little crowd of people going on here at Scandia tonight.

56
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:41,811
[SPEAKER_13]: They look very nice to me.

57
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,492
[SPEAKER_13]: They look kind of mean.

58
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,809
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all glaring going, what the hell is going on here?

59
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,071
[SPEAKER_04]: This, by the way, is the site of DDR Shaft.

60
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:57,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacramento hosts another... Sacramento, or Sacramento, sorry, hosts another fucking tournament.

61
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, fabulous tournament.

62
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,816
[SPEAKER_04]: On November 9th, and Jamie will give us more details on that later.

63
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I would like to introduce everybody that's here tonight.

64
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:06,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start over here.

65
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,478
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Derek.

66
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I remembered.

67
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I remembered your real name for once.

68
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But what would the online folks know you as?

69
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends how long they've been there.

70
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:17,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say the recent folks.

71
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:18,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Phalanx Zero.

72
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:19,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Phalanx Zero.

73
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, what an evil sounding name.

74
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you'd get it if you read X-Men.

75
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:25,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Phalanx X-Men?

76
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:26,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

77
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,399
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

78
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the whole thing that they introduced the Generation X in.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,300
[SPEAKER_11]: That sucks.

80
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm original.

81
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:34,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Hee hee.

82
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:35,942
No.

83
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's bad.

84
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I see the lovely lady that's with you here tonight is a little bit radio shy.

85
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:43,244
[SPEAKER_04]: She's farting.

86
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: She's retarded.

87
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a nice thing to say to your lady friend.

88
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:48,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You should smack him.

89
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,357
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the nicest thing I said all day.

90
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,198
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you have to say in response to that?

91
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call him an ass like I always do.

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass!

93
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, man.

94
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name, dear?

95
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:57,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Lizzie.

96
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:00,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not really in the DDR community, though, right?

97
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I play a little bit of DDR.

98
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,226
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

99
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:05,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask the big newbie question.

100
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:06,729
[SPEAKER_04]: What footers are you on?

101
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on five footers or seven footers?

102
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Six, seven, something like that.

103
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Round of applause for the six and seven.

104
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

105
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:14,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello everybody to J.B.

00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny Rom owned me at Max 2.

108
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she smack your ass and call you Papa?

109
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,076
[SPEAKER_04]: He's our Jenny Rom fanboy.

110
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:51,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Rom.

111
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:53,178
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it about Jenny Rom that's so fucking cool?

112

[SPEAKER_13]: No!

121
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:51,442
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be one of those shows where we have to fight with a loudspeaker the whole time.

122
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:54,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an experimental show, ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me remind you.

124
00:06:55,003 --> 00:07:01,125
[SPEAKER_20]: And remember, if you can't be... And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:03,939
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I like Grease.

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that damn movie.

127
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it 50 million times.

128
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,864
[SPEAKER_21]: I know all the damn songs.

129
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Grease is classic.

130
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:10,806
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on DVD now.

131
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:11,286
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's Satan.

132
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:12,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Grease is Satan.

133
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is Grease Satan?

134
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:14,009
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with you?

135
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my sister watched it like five times a day for like three weeks straight.

136
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Grease came out when I was like two.

137
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not cool.

138
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:22,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I was enjoying her.

139
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, when I was eight years old, I watched the movie Clue every day for an entire summer.

140
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:29,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that movie.

141
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:31,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're back on my good side.

142
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:31,944
[SPEAKER_04]: You better stay there.

143
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:33,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like four endings.

144
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, three.

145
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:34,325
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three.

146
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're making actually a Grease 3.

147
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,106
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

148
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:38,667
[SPEAKER_13]: They better not.

149
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:39,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they are.

150
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, Clue had Tim Curry.

151
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Tim Curry kicked ass.

152
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And what else was Tim Curry in?

153
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocky.

154
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,030
Yay!

155
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would they make a great Grease 3?

156
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Grease 3 starring the Olivia Project.

157
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you never been there?

158
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,673
[SPEAKER_13]: You had a car in the first, the cars in the first one.

159
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:02,536
[SPEAKER_13]: You had microphones in the second, microphones, motorcycles in the second one.

160
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:04,097
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to have next, a moped?

161
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:05,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a high school reunion.

162
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

163
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bringing back the original cast, too.

164
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:09,962
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be cool.

165
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like instead of Romy and Michelle, it's John and Olivia's high school reunion?

166
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:14,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

167
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we're a Bomani show, huh?

168
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:17,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

169
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,284
[SPEAKER_13]: You're listening to... You said Olivia Project, so it counts.

170
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, yeah, sorry, I made a reference.

171
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:23,706
Xanadu!

172
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot that other song, but... Xanadu!

173
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Xanadu!

174
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

175
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Which was also a good movie.

176
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Jamie, you said you'd be the only person... Yes, Xanadu was a movie that came out in 1990, I mean 1980.

177
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, name me one other person in the Xanadu fan club.

178
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:40,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

179
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Who else is in the Xanadu fan club but me?

180
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And my friend.

181
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And your friend, who's your friend?

182
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:49,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, my friend, Gwen, who listens in Maryland, who's trying to listen anyway.

183
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:49,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Gwen.

184
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,171
[SPEAKER_13]: If you happen to be listening, then hi.

185
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:52,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

186
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to put a plug in for the chat room.

187
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:58,454
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably people there chatting, even though we're not really doing a show tonight.

188
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,155
[SPEAKER_13]: People there all the time.

189
00:08:59,175 --> 00:08:59,735
[SPEAKER_13]: They have no life.

190
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:00,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hi, JB.

191
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:01,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're kidding.

192
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We love our chatters.

193
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Since he's here, he's got... Since he's here, he's not in this chat room.

194
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:06,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he could be.

195
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:08,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

197
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

198
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: If it retains, he might be there Sunday night.

199
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:12,862
[SPEAKER_09]: How is this for a paradox?

200
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:13,342
Huh?

201
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Twilight Zone.

202
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:27,104
[SPEAKER_04]: To join our chat room, just go to any other site IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and you're just going to join Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.

203
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:32,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to get interviewed.

204
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,786
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other people here I want to interview while they're here too.

205
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go kidnap people.

206
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to get Keith before he leaves.

207
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:47,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say, actually I should start this week's episode by saying, you're listening to the most extreme station of all things Bomani.

208
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:49,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extreme.

209
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of extreme.

210
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:53,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We can touch on that a little bit now.

211
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get into it in more depth later, because we're getting people to interview.

212
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:01,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about, what is so extreme about this week's show?

213
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:05,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, first off... What the fuck was that right now?

214
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:05,588
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that?

215
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:07,029
[SPEAKER_02]: That's corny as hell.

216
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:07,410
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

217
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:14,024
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, we do have a new record holder.

218
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:22,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, before the show, Loki, world record champion on Conjoined Twin Galaxies, except we didn't have a video camera to tape it, so it won't count.

219
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,754
[SPEAKER_04]: But, when we do get a camera...

220
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: He will, except Black Lab has sworn to me he will destroy the world record no matter where it's at.

221
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,239
[SPEAKER_04]: He will train long and hard.

222
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,041
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be like Sylvester Stallone in Rocky.

223
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,341
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to beat that record.

224
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put it this way.

225
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:45,807
[SPEAKER_02]: The record was so sad that actually me, who can't perfect the tackle or shit, beat the record by like a good 40 or 50 million points.

226
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It's freaking cold out here.

227
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:54,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could have played the last song, Dynamite Rave, doing freestyle and still would have beat that stupid record.

228
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We can say Raven, he can't play that.

229
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go back and edit it in the show later.

230
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a hug!

231
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,647
[SPEAKER_04]: The person we wanted to interview left.

232
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

233
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Jer?

234
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Jer still in there?

235
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Jer's gonna come.

236
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, go interview that guy over there.

237
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the gazebo empty?

238
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:12,591
[SPEAKER_13]: The gazebo?

239
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: The gazebo.

240
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:14,592
[SPEAKER_04]: The gazebo we go.

241
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,874
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do anything we want while this show's going.

242
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We migrate to the gazebo.

243
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:18,855
[SPEAKER_04]: We're walking over to the gazebo.

244
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,679
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't swim in the pond, but you can be there.

245
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,942
[SPEAKER_05]: We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and do golf claps and shit.

246
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, the listeners couldn't hear you.

247
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:33,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and clap for them and stuff, even though they suck.

248
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, now this is a great table.

249
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,027
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a big table.

250
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:38,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Wind shielded.

251
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind shielded.

252
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:43,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, this is like the carpet that they put on the walls at roller rinks.

253
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you guys on that side are going to have to raise your hand if you want to talk, so I can hand you a microphone.

254
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't yell.

255
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Slighty song.

256
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:55,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally passed that.

257
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's talk about DDR Extreme.

258
00:11:59,315 --> 00:11:59,755
Yay!

259
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Sexstream!

260
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:01,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's change.

261
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek, let's change.

262
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:04,178
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can.

263
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:05,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't change for anyone.

264
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sit on that side of the table.

265
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sit on this side.

266
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,181
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really great radio, by the way.

267
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:14,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

268
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:15,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

269
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:16,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, other side of the table.

270
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:16,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi!

271
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:29,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess, I always saw Loki as kind of our news desk of the show, so I'll let him talk about DDR Extreme, even though he's not prepared to.

272
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure he'll have something nice to say.

273
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:34,998
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Loki now doing news for Team Guilo.

274
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:35,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

275
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a comment about that.

276
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,761
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of an F-you to myself.

277
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:52,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I was viciously pointed out by DJ Paranoia to have copied his list and put it on Team Guilo, which is a big, big, big, big, big, big note of if you don't give credit.

278
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's plagiarism.

279
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, to begin with, okay, first off, I copied Black Lab's list to begin with, okay?

280
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And that list... Yeah, it doesn't matter about him.

281
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took his list at first.

282
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have any frickin' names on it or none of the artists' names, so that kind of sucked.

283
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So I borrowed his list.

284
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:20,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to put... I mean, shit, man, I'm putting this list up, like, way early in the morning.

285
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:21,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so damn tired.

286
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:27,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that, and then finally it doesn't hit me until he's like, "'Ass, thanks for stealing my list.'"

287
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been hearing about it for like the last three days.

288
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:37,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, gave big credit to him and their, you know, Bomani style for translating Naoki's journal to make it actually legible.

289
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,996
[SPEAKER_02]: The big question is, did you guys kiss and make up?

290
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I kissed ass, I sent him emails, PMs, I even apologized to Spigamas in the DDR Maniacs chatroom.

291
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully some way he got the message that I am gratefully sorry and would be happy to make it up to him.

292
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he shared resources for some story or whatnot.

293
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

294
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,391
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, there will be no putting out, okay?

295
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that's not happening.

296
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:10,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I've gone, you know, above and beyond to apologize for a simple mistake.

297
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that got fixed within a couple hours.

298
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,218
[SPEAKER_13]: You've gone down and apologized.

299
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:19,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And look, if he gives you hell for it, just use the Nifty at Global Gate translator because it does it nearly perfectly anyway.

300
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:20,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it wasn't that.

301
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:23,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just I used his list that had the names on it.

302
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-de-de-doo.

303
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:26,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-de-shit.

304
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,828
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I could have just done the list myself.

305
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:38,179
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not plagiarizing anymore, but if I were, I certainly would reformat the shit so it wouldn't look anything like anyone else's.

306
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You just plagiarized Black Lab, because that's okay.

307
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:45,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't matter, he's in our... He's probably in the chatroom right now.

308
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,028
[SPEAKER_02]: He's nobody important.

309
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:46,629
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future.

310
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Black Lab, I didn't mean that.

311
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,362
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but anyways, yeah, so I'm doing news now.

312
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:57,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sucks because now I have to be on top of all the news stories instead of browsing the internet and, you know, chatting in chat rooms.

313
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on top, going down, bending over backwards.

314
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:01,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Good lord, you're an acrobat.

315
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Down, down, down.

316
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:05,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so...

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, but one of the things I was able to have that no one else did have is I actually got those clips from the DDR Max USA, all the new samples.

318
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:22,274
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposedly going to be in there because everyone gave me shit about that too, saying, oh, how do you know that shit's going to be in there?

319
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:23,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not confirmed?

320
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:24,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

321
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I really give a shit.

322
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just ripping samples for people to hear.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a comment on that.

324
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:33,743
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not going to be in the game, why do they exist?

325
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:35,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the old stuff, I understand.

326
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:36,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami?

327
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy?

328
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:37,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

329
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They leave the old stuff from Max Japan in there, like Ghost and things like that, and they sneak in there.

330
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:46,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but these new remixes weren't just done for the hell of it.

331
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, maybe Naoki gets bored one night, he's doing his nails, like, hmm.

332
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:59,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I'll remix, uh... Dear Diary, I ran out of black fingernail polish, so I decided to remix a new song with my best buddy.

333
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would they be in there if they're not going to be in the final game?

334
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it just specifically throw us off?

335
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:11,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even if it is just there to throw us off, hey, it's a new Bomani remix clip, that's newsworthy.

336
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:16,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then the fact that Kakumei was in there, okay, the clip for Kakumei, and they're like,

337
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:20,246
[SPEAKER_02]: and some guys like, no, that got cut and so did Ghost.

338
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for sure.

339
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm actually developing the game, so I know.

340
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:25,327
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your source?

341
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:30,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all, well, shit, man, if you guys got information, start sharing instead of calling me, telling me I'm wrong, you know.

342
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Start sharing some info.

343
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:32,469
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

344
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:33,449
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

345
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:39,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you work for Konami or you're sleeping with someone who works for Konami, we just can't believe you.

346
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

347
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,552
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to have to all wait until, you know, the game comes out.

348
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:43,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

349
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:45,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

350
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get right on sleeping with everybody.

351
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:49,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

352
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:49,755
[SPEAKER_11]: You whore.

353
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of.

354
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:55,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anybody at this table put out for information on Max?

355
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are sad and pathetic.

356
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:03,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, first of all, my fiance manages a GameStop.

357
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,028
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to put out.

358
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,248
[SPEAKER_13]: It just comes with the job.

359
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But does he get information about Konami?

360
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:10,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes.

361
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Like game releases, but he doesn't really get... No, the reps come to the store.

362
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I have information that I can't talk about.

363
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:19,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go down on some chick at Konami to get information.

364
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you'd be getting some.

365
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:24,453
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

366
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:24,513
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

367
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:26,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.

368
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:32,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Diary, I went to America one day, and there was this guy there who said he'd put out for information about DDR.

369
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:33,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

370
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,299
[SPEAKER_13]: So I put out.

371
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I said chick.

372
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh wait.

373
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:40,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, man.

374
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all.

375
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever see The Crying Game?

376
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,049
[SPEAKER_04]: The Crying Game 2 is starring Naoki Midea.

377
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:51,578
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not want my name mispronounced.

378
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,399
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a pronunciation argument going on over there.

379
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just really, really white.

380
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you want someone to mispronounce your name?

381
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,120
[SPEAKER_13]: They do.

382
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:00,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, how can you mispronounce Derek?

383
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:01,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark.

384
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:03,543
[SPEAKER_13]: We can call you Dirk.

385
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:04,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Jerk.

386
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:06,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, asshole.

387
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

388
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:17,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, DDR Extreme, the very gay-ass name that they applied to DDR Max 3.

389
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:18,576
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense, Drew.

390
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:22,359
[SPEAKER_13]: No, if they got it DDR Cock Sucking Edition, yes, that would be it.

391
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,680
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Ass Fuck Extreme.

392
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:25,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Bar and Grill.

393
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, DDR Extreme.

394
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's what I'm picturing from DDR Extreme.

395
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:36,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have extreme clips in the background, possibly people doing extreme things.

396
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:40,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be extreme songs, and I'm going to get extremely bored with this.

397
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:50,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, they had a little voting thing going on that we mentioned last week, announcing some of the... They didn't do it in Florida.

398
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,449
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as there are no songs by extreme.

399
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:54,370
[SPEAKER_13]: They went out in the 90s.

400
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me guess.

401
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to throw out an idea here.

402
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Could the next Max be...

403
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Max Extreme?

404
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:06,414
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

405
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:06,754
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

406
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the remix of Max 300 by Erotic, Max Sexstream.

407
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:12,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Max.

408
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have sex with your ex.

409
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, that would be fucking sweet.

410
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, don't have sex with your ex.

411
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, it would be evil, too.

412
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that song is awesome.

413
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,003
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways.

414
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:27,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so some of the new songs that they were mentioning that were up there.

415
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,491
[SPEAKER_02]: They're possibly going to be in there.

416
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Not confirmed to be in there, but possibly.

417
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:32,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

418
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with Beatmania 2DX.

419
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got V and A. Fuck you, Loki, by the way.

420
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Which together is VA.

421
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,480
[SPEAKER_02]: VA.

422
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,201
[SPEAKER_13]: For the veterans or something.

423
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:42,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

424
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, let's see.

425
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:54,271
[SPEAKER_02]: From Guitar Freaks, there's Elise, 100 Seconds, and something else that's not Fire or Jet World because I really... Yeah, I want a Jet World.

426
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been sweet.

427
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire from...

428
00:19:57,682 --> 00:20:03,847
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hold on me from, what is it, ParaPara, which everyone's just like, this is crap.

429
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:08,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I agree, you know, I'd rather have, I mean, even like Kingdom of Rock.

430
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, Kingdom of Rock would be awesome.

431
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:14,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom of Rock or even like Burning Desire.

432
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Deluxe, fucking Deluxe in DDR, that would rule.

433
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,162
[SPEAKER_04]: In the microphone, Derek.

434
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:24,905
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the only dance I know, I look so gay doing it.

435
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, we should have Deluxe.

436
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:34,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, first off, just because these, you know, became, these were on, you know, the top of the list here, doesn't mean that they're not going to throw other stuff in there.

437
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's very possible.

438
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be happy if Cosmic Cowgirl was in Max.

439
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:42,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I wonder how long this DDR Extreme is going to last.

440
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and what... One week.

441
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because I think they changed interface designs.

442
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:48,750
[SPEAKER_13]: One week since this game came out.

443
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,853
[SPEAKER_13]: One week since I looked at it.

444
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, how often will it be bootlegged?

445
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:58,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it be a bigger or more rampant bootleg than Moodleg?

446
00:20:58,677 --> 00:20:59,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Moodleg?

447
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Moodleg?

448
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born for radio.

449
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we were having a discussion in the DDR Maniacs chatroom today.

450
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:12,222
[SPEAKER_02]: We were saying hi to all our friends in the DDR Maniacs chatroom.

451
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:13,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi!

452
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:13,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Love ya.

453
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:15,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, yes, Jamie.

454
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm an optimist.

455
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got lots of fans over there, don't we?

456
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:21,466
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

457
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do.

458
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:25,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

459
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:26,374
[SPEAKER_02]: We have you.

460
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:27,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're all the fans.

461
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm speaking to the one fan, Twen, and talking to him today.

462
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:38,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were discussing the fact that DDR Extreme, since it is so extreme, should have a fog machine and lasers.

463
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Because who doesn't like a good laser?

464
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:46,926
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said earlier on another chat board, I said it should be, it's kind of a joke I used earlier, but I don't care.

465
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:47,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still funny.

466
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:51,088
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Sex Stream with a big pole in the middle.

467
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:54,013
[SPEAKER_04]: and all erotic set of songs.

468
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,594
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember what I was saying the other night?

469
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:55,954
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

470
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That it needs the butt pad so you can have booty mode.

471
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:58,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

472
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:02,979
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna put a button on the bar so you can like rub your ass against the bar.

473
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:07,141
[SPEAKER_13]: We need the grind.

474
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:08,022
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you saying JB?

475
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:09,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot.

476
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:18,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, what they're going to do is they're going to have a nice little chair in front of the pads itself.

477
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And sitting on the chair will be a mannequin.

478
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bump and grind against the mannequin to get some bonus points there.

479
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:28,490
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be one of those real dolls of Naoki.

480
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got session mode with Boonga Boonga.

481
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:35,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, what's scary is...

482
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:36,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Eek!

483
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:36,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Eek!

484
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:36,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Eek!

485
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:37,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Eek!

486
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:00,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat it, beat it

487
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either have Beat It by DJ Alligator Project or Erotic.

488
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:41,677
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my watch.

489
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, this will explode.

490
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: This watch has the time of your doom.

491
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:46,839
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my 007 watch.

492
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:47,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the doomsday clock.

493
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,761
[SPEAKER_13]: They gave out to all the managers of GameStop.

494
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,281
[SPEAKER_04]: 11.59 and ticking.

495
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

496
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:53,543
The time is .59.

497
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Time to die.

498
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what nerds are we?

499
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:06,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what other cool things can we expect to see in DDR Extreme?

500
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:08,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, JB.

501
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Gillette?

502
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want no short dick, man.

503
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,861
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember that song?

504
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm going to play that during one of the breaks.

505
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:25,506
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember when I'm putting this show together, when I get back home and editing it, I'll put Gillette as one of the songs we'll play.

506
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:27,087
[SPEAKER_04]: What about what?

507
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:28,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's a good song.

508
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to play that for you if I remember.

509
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,167
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the one song that I definitely want played.

510
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:33,747
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

511
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Children of the Sandstorm.

512
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:37,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Now explain this mix.

513
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:42,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking for a sandstorm because I actually did not have it on my computer.

514
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: You just couldn't get enough of last week's joke.

515
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,470
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Sunday night after I got home.

516
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And I found, for people who are familiar with it, Robert Miles did a song called Children.

517
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,871
[SPEAKER_13]: And I found that mixed with Sandstorm.

518
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,011
[SPEAKER_13]: That was actually pretty nice.

519
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a huge song when I was in high school.

520
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:57,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel so old.

521
00:24:58,652 --> 00:24:59,392
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a good mix.

522
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:03,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was basically cut and paste type, but it was done very smoothly.

523
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:05,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, JB left you a present, by the way.

524
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, JB, explain the present that you left for Jamie.

525
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:15,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it was Dynamite R3, or R5.

526
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And explain, tell us a little bit about Dynamite R5.

527
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:23,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dynamite Rave and R5 mixed together.

528
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:24,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent, very good, yes.

529
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:27,465
[SPEAKER_13]: I must listen to this right away.

530
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:28,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Golf Land.

531
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in the gazebo overlooking the lovely course here.

532
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I see... This is... We've got a castle right in front of us.

533
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're not at Golf Land.

534
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:36,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

535
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

536
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: There's... Assholes?

537
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:41,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And their stuff's messed up.

538
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:42,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

539
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:46,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Initial D took my money, but I'm addicted to that game.

540
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fuck the money for a second.

541
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:48,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about Initial D. Oh, wait.

542
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki had something to say?

543
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Yeah, I'm guessing we'll hear... Supposedly what's going to be happening week to week with Naoki...

544
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,351
[SPEAKER_21]: I love that song.

545
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

546
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Another song was announced for DVR Extreme.

547
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:08,056
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a new Ryu, whatever her damn name is, Kosuka or... I Blow Naoki.

548
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I Blow Naoki.

549
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu, I Blow Naoki.

550
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:16,860
[SPEAKER_02]: She's doing a song that's called... Shit, I don't know, whatever.

551
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some stupid song.

552
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:23,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like Candy, but it's supposed to be heavy metal or rock or some crap like that.

553
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:24,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Wee, wee, wee.

554
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:25,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Wee, wee, wee.

555
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:27,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Wee, wee, wee.

556
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:29,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Wee!

557
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:30,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, you guys keep going.

558
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna run in and see if anyone else showed up.

559
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:35,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, um, Naoki's Journal sucks.

560
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,972
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be doing, like, some interviews or questionnaires with, uh, staff.

561
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:40,013
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we give a shit.

562
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:43,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing what the staff thinks about DDR Extreme.

563
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,916
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably all gonna say, uh, Naoki's gay.

564
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:46,116
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR!

565
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:50,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, let's see here.

566
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:54,120
[SPEAKER_13]: And meanwhile over here, you're hearing voices.

567
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I keep hearing somebody saying my name, and it's not JB.

568
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,004
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they're going...

569
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:00,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Big fuck!

570
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:01,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Big fuck!

571
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,194
[SPEAKER_11]: It just sounds like it.

572
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:09,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we have this big gap of space here, I'm going to go ahead and do the sim update for this week.

573
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have news this week, which is pretty cool.

574
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's my turn to excuse myself.

575
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:14,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Take the mic.

576
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:15,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

577
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:18,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here's what's going on in the sim world here.

578
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,459
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, you have a new release of Set Mania.

579
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:29,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Set Mania, actually, it's kind of been called Beta 6 Release 2, or what they're calling it is Beta 7.

580
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:32,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Beta 7's out now.

581
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:32,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I've

582
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it at home.

583
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:37,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten to try it out yet, but StepMania hasn't disappointed me yet.

584
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: My StepMania doesn't work on my computer.

585
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:42,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to not like StepMania back in the early versions.

586
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:43,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a liar.

587
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a liar.

588
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:58,921
[SPEAKER_02]: StepMania really did disappoint me back in version 1.6, 1.6.5, that area, because it didn't load, and it sucked, and it was really slow, and it was a piece of shit, and DWI kicked his ass.

589
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: However, since then, since they've gone actually doing public updates, where there's like 30 people working on updating this thing instead of 2, it's gotten a lot better.

590
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got now, you have pump support, para-para support, you also have easy-to-dancer support in there, so that's kind of cool.

591
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means what?

592
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means you can play those games on that simulator.

593
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

594
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody knows that.

595
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:26,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

596
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... She didn't know!

597
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Derek's a little slow.

598
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,741
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm fat and I didn't eat today.

599
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:41,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, other than that, let's see, on a personal note, I'm putting up DWIs on the internet.

600
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:44,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually got my own site that's going to be started here pretty soon.

601
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,905
[SPEAKER_02]: LeachFromLoki.com Hey!

602
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

603
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:50,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad name.

604
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I rule.

605
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:55,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna call that Leech from Loki.

606
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome, though, because I found a site.

607
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like gamers.com or some shit like that.

608
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Gamers Club, I believe it's what it's called.

609
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 50 megs of web space free and unlimited bandwidth.

610
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:08,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

611
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlimited bandwidth.

612
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:10,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I can put stuff on there.

613
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,714
[SPEAKER_02]: No one will worry about my site going down.

614
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:12,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

615
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super orgasmic.

616
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have my DWIs on there.

617
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:19,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, really hard to find rare 8-style DWIs.

618
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's free, right?

619
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's free.

620
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool.

621
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing that.

622
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe get a couple of sites if I run out of my 50 megs.

623
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You run out of space?

624
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:30,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of stuff.

625
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:32,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for that pretty soon.

626
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:33,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll announce it later on.

627
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they bog you down with banner ads or any of that crap?

628
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, yes, they do.

629
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is ever really free.

630
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Mozilla.com, highly recommended by Orange Lounge staff.

631
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Block ads, awesome, love it.

632
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, sounds good.

633
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll put a link to that on my site.

634
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:54,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they won't like it, but I'll put a link up there.

635
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we'll have that.

636
00:29:56,331 --> 00:30:00,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And, see, other than that, I don't know, not too much going on in the sim world.

637
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: More people releasing stuff.

638
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,517
[SPEAKER_02]: The Euromix DWIs are coming along pretty good on...

639
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR UK.

640
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:12,620
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually got now the official backgrounds for Hysteria 2001 and Before You, Before is the Beat Mix, which is pretty cool looking.

641
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:19,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're also going to be adding the rest of the DWIs, including Caribbean Queen.

642
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:20,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

643
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:21,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that song.

644
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribbean Queen.

645
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:26,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, anyways.

646
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no more of me singing.

647
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:30,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, never mind.

648
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:31,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh...

649
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,141
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so, are we doing interviews or something?

650
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:36,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who's back.

651
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,882
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just Jamie.

652
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's coming back, and everybody that we wanted to interview left, so no interviews.

653
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Jared's still inside.

654
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Jared's still inside.

655
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll come out here later.

656
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,609
[SPEAKER_04]: He's teaching a little kid how to play DDR or something.

657
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:50,750
[SPEAKER_04]: He already knows how to play DDR.

658
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I see that kid here a lot, actually.

659
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:52,611
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like a regular here.

660
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:53,912
[SPEAKER_13]: He's past the hard stuff.

661
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: We should get him.

662
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:56,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We should interview him.

663
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:58,195
[SPEAKER_13]: He wants to be interviewed.

664
00:30:58,495 --> 00:30:58,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

665
00:30:58,835 --> 00:30:59,556
[SPEAKER_13]: He wants to be interviewed.

666
00:30:59,576 --> 00:30:59,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

667
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Get him out of here.

668
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:01,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to go.

669
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:02,758
[SPEAKER_13]: If we go inside...

670
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:04,563
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going inside?

671
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go inside.

672
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're migrating.

673
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:12,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't this a nice, lovely, chilly afternoon?

674
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling fat and sassy.

675
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:15,772
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nighttime.

676
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:16,493
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nighttime.

677
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:17,133
[SPEAKER_04]: See, dark time.

678
00:31:17,173 --> 00:31:17,854
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there's the moon.

679
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:18,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a banana!

680
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:21,697
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a banana, that's the moon!

681
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:23,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's the moon.

682
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:24,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Mr. Moon?

683
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how many funny looks we're getting as we come in here.

684
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:28,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we're back inside.

685
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:32,185
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going into the party room with these lovely people.

686
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, lovely people.

687
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hide in the corner where nobody can find us.

688
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:43,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're at a much smaller table.

689
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been demoted.

690
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's warm in here.

691
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we were supposed to shrink with coldness.

692
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, dang.

693
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:57,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, somebody just failed the song.

694
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard it.

695
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:00,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey now, that's not very nice.

696
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to be supportive of everybody, remember?

697
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:04,369
[SPEAKER_13]: We support you!

698
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:07,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a good jockstrap.

699
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,290
[SPEAKER_13]: You are supported.

700
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,631
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just full of jokes today.

701
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm fucking hyper because I had cupcakes.

702
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:23,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Take that off of your ear, that's my damn watch.

703
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:23,613
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

704
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did Loki go?

705
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:27,554
[SPEAKER_13]: He went to play his edits.

706
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so what should we talk about now?

707
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:34,277
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no fucking whistles on.

708
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:36,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

709
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:39,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, yes.

710
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,739
[SPEAKER_13]: This is fucked up.

711
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have Jamie's music and I'm too lazy to put it in.

712
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,621
[SPEAKER_13]: So edit my damn music in.

713
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:49,242
[SPEAKER_13]: What, Katima style?

714
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:50,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's that?

715
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you haven't heard the Kutimu stuff.

716
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:57,834
[SPEAKER_13]: It's basically people taking different Bimani songs and singing them.

717
00:32:57,854 --> 00:32:58,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, I've heard that.

718
00:32:58,575 --> 00:32:59,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki showed me.

719
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,536
[SPEAKER_05]: They're funny as hell.

720
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:04,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about it more on the show next week.

721
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you put some on the show last week?

722
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:08,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we didn't get around to it.

723
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:11,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to, but we had just an action-packed show last week.

724
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:13,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an extremely packed show.

725
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough with that word.

726
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:16,847
[SPEAKER_05]: No more extreme words.

727
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Extreme Radio!

728
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: You find me to be extremely annoying?

729
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:23,543
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I find you extremely sexy.

730
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:24,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

731
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

732
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:28,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, my fuck you of the week.

733
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:28,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

734
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

735
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:36,032
[SPEAKER_13]: My fuck you of the week goes towards going home and finding out that Dan ate all the lasagna last night.

736
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:37,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Lasagna?

737
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:38,574
[SPEAKER_21]: I like lasagna.

738
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was going to be my fucking lunch today.

739
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:42,737
What a dick.

740
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:44,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you talking about?

741
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:45,559
[SPEAKER_13]: My fiance.

742
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:46,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't call him a dick, asshole.

743
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:50,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a dog or something.

744
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,961
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

745
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie doesn't own a dog.

746
00:33:56,683 --> 00:33:58,004
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't be on our show anymore.

747
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:58,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Go away.

748
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:00,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm serious.

749
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:00,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Go away.

750
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:02,768
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not allowed to be on the show anymore.

751
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,451
[SPEAKER_13]: You think I'm kidding, don't you?

752
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: She's in her randy mode.

753
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,594
[SPEAKER_13]: You think I'm kidding, don't you?

754
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:11,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

755
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,337
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

756
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:17,380
[SPEAKER_04]: During the commercial break, Jamie's going to go kick the crap out of our guests.

757
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So, he ate the lasagna.

758
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:21,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't have any dinner.

759
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:22,427
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you eat?

760
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:23,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to have eaten something.

761
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,890
[SPEAKER_13]: A microwave burrito.

762
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,111
[SPEAKER_13]: A dog.

763
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a dog, shut up.

764
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a pretty cat.

765
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

766
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:31,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a Shermie.

767
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:32,358
[SPEAKER_04]: A what?

768
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:33,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Shermie.

769
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:34,179
[SPEAKER_13]: What was his name?

770
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:37,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Shermie is his name.

771
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:39,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my girl kitty.

772
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Shermie isn't a breed of cat.

773
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:43,359
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a Shermie.

774
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what type of cat is it?

775
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,121
[SPEAKER_11]: A Shermie?

776
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,122
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a she!

777
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,604
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just digging yourself deeper tonight.

778
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:51,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little gray cat.

779
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:54,728
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a... She looks like Church from Pet Sematary.

780
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:56,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's actually a good point.

781
00:34:56,549 --> 00:34:57,790
[SPEAKER_13]: You never saw Pet Sematary.

782
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I was afraid of it.

783
00:34:58,851 --> 00:34:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a scary movie.

784
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:00,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Was?

785
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I was afraid of Child's Play.

786
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:04,235
[SPEAKER_05]: That movie freaked the shit out of me.

787
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like little stabby doll things.

788
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I was scared of The Wizard of Oz.

789
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:10,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, you were scared of The Wizard of Oz?

790
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

791
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:13,933
[SPEAKER_21]: The little mumpins.

792
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:18,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The monkeys that fly on the... The monkeys that fly out of their ass?

793
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:21,538
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's the lollipop kids.

794
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:23,219
[SPEAKER_21]: The munchkins.

795
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever see the great sequel Return to Oz?

796
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:28,683
[SPEAKER_04]: With the thing on the wheels?

797
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:31,005
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're thinking of the whiz.

798
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:34,326
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Return to Oz was good.

799
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:38,768
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why Return to Oz was good is because it was actually based off of the book.

800
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Farooza Balk was in it, and she's cool.

801
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,112
[SPEAKER_13]: The Wizard of Oz was not true to the book, because she went and met all of the witches.

802
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:53,796
[SPEAKER_13]: She met the Good Witch of the North, the Good Witch of the South, killed one of them, and then killed the other.

803
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:56,417
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was no balance, and Oz fell into ruin.

804
00:35:58,638 --> 00:35:59,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the freakiest scene in Return to Oz.

805
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,700
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all the little heads in the jar.

806
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:03,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so cool.

807
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,190
[SPEAKER_13]: That was awesome.

808
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, but Monty, what?

809
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

810
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But Monty, what?

811
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,671
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Random Night on Orange Lounge.

812
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:10,712
[SPEAKER_13]: You heard it here first.

813
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:11,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know something we brought up earlier?

814
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:12,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ass!

815
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:13,653
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not ass.

816
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:17,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not but Monty related exactly, but it's still pretty cool.

817
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Initial D. Rob is staring at me.

818
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:23,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, listeners.

819
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Initial D, Mad Eurobeat.

820
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:28,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fatty.

821
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:28,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fatty.

822
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:29,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Please explain.

823
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just fat.

824
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Fat with a P or Fat with an F?

825
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:34,687
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Fat with Fat.

826
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:39,650
[SPEAKER_13]: And Orange Beanie has my SNIS one that I messed up on.

827
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain for those who may not know about Initial D, what makes it so special?

828
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:44,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Mad European action!

829
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:45,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And?

830
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:46,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Cars!

831
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And?

832
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And bad animation.

833
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:50,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cards!

834
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the little cards!

835
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:52,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And shitty storyline!

836
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:54,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and...

837
00:36:58,235 --> 00:36:59,456
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, neat cars.

838
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:00,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one.

839
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have my Trueno.

840
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what?

841
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to fucking get that spoiler.

842
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:06,863
[SPEAKER_13]: That spoiler looks like shit.

843
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:10,767
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know I can pass the option of upgrading my car.

844
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:13,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, your name really is Fatty.

845
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,875
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm lucky enough to have a four-letter handle online, so I never have...

846
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:39,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, whoever of our listeners who was not there the night that I made my car, if you can guess the name that's on my card, for the card that I'm using right now, I will give you a memory card.

847
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:40,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

848
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:41,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Memory card.

849
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,649
[SPEAKER_04]: For what system?

850
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:44,190
[SPEAKER_13]: For a PS2.

851
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:45,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Not for a PS2, for a PlayStation.

852
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: PS1.

853
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:50,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You win a DarkSakura autographed memory card.

854
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:53,174
[SPEAKER_13]: You win a DarkSakura autographed memory card.

855
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:54,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's your first clue.

856
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,395
[SPEAKER_13]: It's R. You get two clues.

857
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're pretty easy clues if you know how to find it.

858
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:02,597
[SPEAKER_11]: The password is... Shut up.

859
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,018
[SPEAKER_13]: The first clue is that the word is Greek.

860
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, now wait a minute, didn't they ban video games in Greece?

861
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck Greece.

862
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:13,922
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, they overruled that.

863
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Second rule is that it means goal.

864
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:22,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Goal!

865
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:23,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Like soccer?

866
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:25,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, or like, you know, a goal.

867
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:27,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, because you've got to have goals.

868
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:35,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta believe!

869
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:43,027
[SPEAKER_13]: So whoever can guess what the word is, who was not there the night I made it, will win a DarkSakura autographed PlayStation memory card.

870
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:45,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you'll win an orange bat.

871
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,891
[SPEAKER_13]: A DarkSakura autographed orange bat.

872
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:51,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's the bat, I'll autograph it too, because the bat's big enough.

873
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:52,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't autograph a memory card, but I can autograph a bat.

874
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:53,356
[SPEAKER_05]: You can autograph the back.

875
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question that actually involves Bimani.

876
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, please do share.

877
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Initial D. No.

878
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:03,075
[SPEAKER_04]: No, tonight's initial D night.

879
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

880
00:39:04,116 --> 00:39:05,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, ask your question.

881
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:06,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

882
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:09,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Ohi, Ohi who needs a shovel for the trouble he's getting in on this show.

883
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:14,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because like Max 2 is coming out for PS2, right?

884
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:16,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Psst, eventually.

885
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:20,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but PS2 memo cards don't work on the machine.

886
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:21,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, good.

887
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:22,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

888
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Here he comes.

889
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:30,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is just like DDR Max, okay?

890
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:38,287
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is you can save onto your PlayStation 2 memory card, then it has a library option where you can export edits onto memory cards for the PlayStation 1.

891
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:40,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's how it works.

892
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:45,390
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually converts them to PS1 format, then you go into your memory on your system and move it over.

893
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,270
[SPEAKER_04]: More or less, yeah.

894
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:47,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's play a new game.

895
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember...

896
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember Loki's edit contest?

897
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: How I had the edit to Somewhere Over the Rainbow?

898
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the one that I got second place in.

899
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:57,432
[SPEAKER_13]: You just held my hand.

900
00:39:57,993 --> 00:39:59,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, you're in deep shit with me right now.

901
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:01,535
[SPEAKER_20]: And me now.

902
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:02,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

903
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:04,938
[SPEAKER_13]: You died tonight.

904
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:07,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

905
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some weird name edits tonight for people to play.

906
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:12,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a sexer me.

907
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a... Okay, okay.

908
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:20,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Sex or Me, it's for gimme, gimme, gimme.

909
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, uh, I've got Pink Taco, I can't remember what that's for.

910
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:27,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

911
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:28,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, wouldn't it be Pink Dinosaur?

912
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:32,018
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's Pink Taco, it has nothing to do- No, I mean, it wouldn't be Dinosaur?

913
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:32,859
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

914
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

915
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:40,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've got, uh, I've got one for Shake Your Booty, it's called Shake That Ass.

916
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:41,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

917
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:42,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've got-

918
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:48,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got one... You know you look good when you back that ass up.

919
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:50,883
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

920
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one that's called Ass Fire.

921
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you do, eat at Del Taco?

922
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:04,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but the song is pretty hard and... Ah, shit.

923
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:05,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

924
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,546
[SPEAKER_13]: I got some really fun... As JB goes off to play Jenny Rom.

925
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:11,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm turning this over to you because I feel sick.

926
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,260
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait, you had a game you wanted to play, Jamie?

927
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:18,048
[SPEAKER_13]: When we come back from the break, we should play Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.

928
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:21,195
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in my ass.

929
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:22,578
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're not going to play.

930
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:23,139
[SPEAKER_13]: A pickle!

931
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:26,667
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the Anna Nicole Smith show, come on.

932
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:32,449
[SPEAKER_13]: When we come back from break, we are going to play Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.

933
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:36,111
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are going to have an interview with Jer.

934
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:36,911
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll think of something.

935
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: After break, an interview with Tajer.

936
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:40,793
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

937
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:44,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoever wins will get an autographed Propel bottle from me.

938
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:46,015
[SPEAKER_04]: After I'm done drinking it.

939
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And backwashing a lot.

940
00:41:51,431 --> 00:41:53,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You drink like, what, 44 ounces of soda?

941
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:54,252
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

942
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:56,253
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I feel sick.

943
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:57,013
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't hear you.

944
00:41:58,294 --> 00:42:01,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I'd be willing to urinate in the bottle, too, if that would increase the value of it.

945
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:02,595
[SPEAKER_04]: How nice of you.

946
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:03,856
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so kind and generous.

947
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:04,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

948
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:05,696
[SPEAKER_04]: You're such a giving person.

949
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:06,737
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.

950
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:07,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Loki.

951
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:11,278
[SPEAKER_13]: So, well, it's break time because people have to pee.

952
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back after some of this very fine music here on Orange Lounge Radio.

953
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 15 and a half.

954
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:20,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pre-taped tonight.

955
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:22,779
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not pre-taped yet.

956
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:23,721
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still taping.

957
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, when they hear it, it's going to be pre-taped.

958
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:26,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it!

959
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:27,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Paradox!

960
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:28,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Paradox!

961
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I can sing the music on the break.

962
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to break now.

963
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:31,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut!

964
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

965
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:32,951
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what I'm

966
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:30,018
[SPEAKER_16]: I may be a little drunk, I mean tipsy

967
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we're back from break.

968
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're Brack.

969
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:18,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Brack?

970
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:19,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Brack.

971
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:19,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Brack.

972
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:21,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even, what is Brack?

973
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:22,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what I just said.

974
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Brack is from Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

975
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:27,096
[SPEAKER_05]: He is me.

976
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: He's crazy and stupid.

977
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:30,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You're Brack?

978
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm Brack.

979
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Brack.

980
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Bingo.

981
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to climb on things.

982
00:49:36,901 --> 00:49:37,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have a banana?

983
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:38,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Eek, eek.

984
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:40,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I got an F. It's eek, eek.

985
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's eek, eek.

986
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:42,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I went over to Brittany's house.

987
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:43,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?

988
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,679
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much fighting here.

989
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:47,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't... I can't... Hey, new game.

990
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:47,561
[SPEAKER_13]: No, there isn't.

991
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:49,763
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to play... We're going to play a game.

992
00:49:50,503 --> 00:49:53,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have to... I have to say, though, during the break, we lost to JB.

993
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So... But we gained to Brad.

994
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:55,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

995
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Hi, Brad.

996
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:57,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Brad.

997
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

998
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:01,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Where... What is this microphone in my face for?

999
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, they're playing Eat You Up.

1000
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:07,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted... I wanted to interview Jer, but he's shy, so... He's playing Eat You Up.

1001
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:08,378
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's sitting right there.

1002
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:08,999
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just shy.

1003
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:09,659
Oh.

1004
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody make faces.

1005
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:16,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally oblivious.

1006
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:16,477
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

1007
00:50:16,497 --> 00:50:17,758
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to play a game.

1008
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:18,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we're going to play a game.

1009
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,100
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.

1010
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:22,982
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in my pants?

1011
00:50:23,222 --> 00:50:23,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

1012
00:50:23,502 --> 00:50:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in my purse?

1013
00:50:24,243 --> 00:50:25,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm being random.

1014
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:28,145
[SPEAKER_13]: And no, you can't guess what's on my purse.

1015
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:30,007
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we play What's in Jamie's Purse?

1016
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:31,468
[SPEAKER_13]: You guess what's in my purse.

1017
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:35,871
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to name an item that is in my purse.

1018
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:38,673
[SPEAKER_13]: And how is this related to Bimani?

1019
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:40,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I do have some Bimani stuff in my purse.

1020
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1021
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:42,311
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

1022
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:44,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess.

1023
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: First guess goes to Brad.

1024
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:47,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's junk.

1025
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Is my junk in your purse?

1026
00:50:51,536 --> 00:50:53,277
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing that belongs to Rob in my purse.

1027
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:57,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, who wants to venture another guess?

1028
00:50:57,999 --> 00:50:58,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Derek.

1029
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Money.

1030
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, is there money in Jamie's purse?

1031
00:51:03,382 --> 00:51:05,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not have any loose money in my purse.

1032
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't say you didn't have money at all.

1033
00:51:08,784 --> 00:51:09,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have money.

1034
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:10,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, thank you.

1035
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:11,596
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have money.

1036
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:11,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1037
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:12,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.

1038
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:12,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go.

1039
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Provolactics.

1040
00:51:18,782 --> 00:51:19,062
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1041
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you need to be prepared.

1042
00:51:23,126 --> 00:51:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know when.

1043
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:25,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always prepared.

1044
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:27,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need tools.

1045
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Next.

1046
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:31,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

1047
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:32,294
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have asked the employee.

1048
00:51:32,314 --> 00:51:34,155
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in my purse?

1049
00:51:35,096 --> 00:51:35,617
[SPEAKER_19]: A pen.

1050
00:51:36,257 --> 00:51:36,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a pen.

1051
00:51:37,058 --> 00:51:38,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a pen in your purse?

1052
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:41,695
[SPEAKER_13]: For extra points, guess what colors?

1053
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:46,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Blue and black.

1054
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:54,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Black, red, purple, green, greenish.

1055
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:58,310
[SPEAKER_13]: The blue pen in my purse is actually missing, but I have a gold one.

1056
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, if you mix some of these colors together, you might get blue.

1057
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:05,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have... Barf is not a color.

1058
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:08,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Barf always has a distinct color.

1059
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:09,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley, what's in my purse?

1060
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:13,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll guess some sort of tissues.

1061
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I once barfed blue Kool-Aid.

1062
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:16,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not shitting you.

1063
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not have any tissues in my purse.

1064
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:22,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no tissues.

1065
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:24,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Trainwreck Radio, is that in your purse?

1066
00:52:26,437 --> 00:52:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's no Trainwreck in my purse.

1067
00:52:30,268 --> 00:52:32,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sort of video game promotional item.

1068
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:34,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game promo item.

1069
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be a token.

1070
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a GameCube lanyard.

1071
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:41,372
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a Game Boy Advance thingy.

1072
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:42,733
[SPEAKER_04]: A thingy?

1073
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:44,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the technical name for it?

1074
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:46,754
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a keychain.

1075
00:52:46,774 --> 00:52:50,396
[SPEAKER_05]: This game's not working if you sit there with your purse open for us all to look in.

1076
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,778
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had a GameCube pen in here once.

1077
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

1078
00:52:58,711 --> 00:52:59,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody gets one more guess.

1079
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:00,552
[SPEAKER_04]: One more guess.

1080
00:53:00,572 --> 00:53:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in my purse?

1081
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1082
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:06,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to do with Happy Bunny.

1083
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:08,655
[SPEAKER_13]: You know this because you bought it.

1084
00:53:10,476 --> 00:53:12,076
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my Happy Bunny token case.

1085
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:13,337
[SPEAKER_13]: It says I hate everything.

1086
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Bunny kicks ass.

1087
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:15,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Happy Bunny.

1088
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:16,478
[SPEAKER_13]: What's in my purse?

1089
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:19,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up and tell me what's in my purse.

1090
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

1091
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:25,482
[SPEAKER_05]: A planner book.

1092
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:28,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I have two of those.

1093
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, double points.

1094
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:32,436
[SPEAKER_04]: A Batsmaroo planner.

1095
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:41,604
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a... Oh, dude, I found another pen.

1096
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a Nyago address book.

1097
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:46,529
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little smushed kitty.

1098
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:49,531
[SPEAKER_11]: A smushed kitty.

1099
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:50,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Next.

1100
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:52,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Air.

1101
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:57,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess a physical item that is not like loose particles.

1102
00:53:57,465 --> 00:53:58,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And not in your head.

1103
00:53:58,926 --> 00:53:59,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1104
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:00,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Meanie.

1105
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:01,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Smack him.

1106
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:05,008
[SPEAKER_13]: A notepad.

1107
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, there is not a notepad in my purse.

1108
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I took it out this morning.

1109
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:14,993
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I took it out when I wrote the rules to freestyle.

1110
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:17,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Bradley.

1111
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:18,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley.

1112
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:22,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, candy bar.

1113
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:23,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Candy Bar.

1114
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:27,915
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a candy bar, we win it.

1115
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:30,256
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she has to add an autograph.

1116
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to autograph it first.

1117
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Tootsie Roll, I'll be damned.

1118
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:35,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that count?

1119
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:35,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1120
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a bar, it's cylindrical, but it's kind of smushed, so now it's a bar.

1121
00:54:40,182 --> 00:54:41,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1122
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:42,323

[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we're playing Guess What's in Jamie's Purse.

1126
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:50,588

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I knew that.

1133
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like playing Family Feud.

1134
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:18,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one answer.

1135
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Penguin mints.

1136
00:55:22,498 --> 00:55:23,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer, good answer.

1137
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm in my second guess, okay?

1138
00:55:26,582 --> 00:55:27,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Chopsticks.

1139
00:55:28,343 --> 00:55:28,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Sunglasses.

1140
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:29,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicodin.

1141
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:33,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have bike it in my purse.

1142
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:36,266
[SPEAKER_03]: A wallet.

1143
00:55:36,286 --> 00:55:38,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Bike it in!

1144
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:41,877
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the worst joke ever told on this show.

1145
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:42,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1146
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:46,221
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, no, Chopstick isn't da-da-da-da-da-da.

1147
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:49,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Chopstick is dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

1148
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:50,504
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a special camera.

1149
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,565
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so special about it?

1150
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:56,668
[SPEAKER_13]: The camera from the DDR Freak moderator strip in Vegas that needs to be developed.

1151
00:55:57,849 --> 00:56:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any scandalous sex stream pictures on there?

1152
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:03,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunk people.

1153
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely blackmailing.

1154
00:56:08,422 --> 00:56:10,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me my thingies!

1155
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:12,604
[SPEAKER_13]: RC Country.

1156
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got games like Matt Hoffman's Triple X, or was it Triple X BMX or whatever they're like that?

1157
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Or BMX Triple X or something like that?

1158
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:26,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You wonder if they're going to ever come out with like, I don't know, an X-rated version of DDR.

1159
00:56:26,371 --> 00:56:29,412
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR Gal's Panic Mix.

1160
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:36,358
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be wrong.

1161
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:37,919
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be involving me.

1162
00:56:37,939 --> 00:56:38,999
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that one game?

1163
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:41,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, there's this game.

1164
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,480
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that game that you play?

1165
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like Kix, and you're drawing the picture, and you get the naked lady, but if you... Scouts Panic.

1166
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:49,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that Scouts?

1167
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:49,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Scouts Panic.

1168
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's another one where it flips around, and at certain times you'll get the evil picture, the demon, and there's this techno music that plays.

1169
00:56:57,704 --> 00:56:59,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes, Everybody run!

1170
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

1171
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1172
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:03,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hi.

1173
00:57:05,484 --> 00:57:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed that joke, Rob.

1174
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:11,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be the only person here who did, but... Probably the only person on all of the internet that enjoyed that joke, but that's alright.

1175
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: My back hurts.

1176
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:19,694
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not like what they were claiming to be the funniest joke.

1177
00:57:22,016 --> 00:57:24,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear candy!

1178
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:25,498
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a quaint little party room.

1179
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:25,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell...

1180
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about Shaft.

1181
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:32,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Any new updates on Shaft?

1182
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:34,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth!

1183
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:35,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, tell us what you know about Shaft.

1184
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Shaft's one bad mother... Shut your mouth!

1185
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:40,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just talking about Shaft!

1186
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:41,666
[SPEAKER_04]: We can dig it.

1187
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:45,788
[SPEAKER_02]: That joke will be over you.

1188
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:48,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's already, but... I can tell you about Shaft.

1189
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:49,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be big.

1190
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Big.

1191
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Big and far!

1192
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it won't run too long.

1193
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,435
[SPEAKER_13]: To quote Ultra Magnus, it's big.

1194
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Bigger than the Matrix.

1195
00:58:03,036 --> 00:58:04,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Ultra Transformers.

1196
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:06,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Transformers are owned.

1197
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:12,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, Shaft, November 9th for all you people who are coming from everywhere.

1198
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, we're having people fly here.

1199
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,240
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

1200
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:18,727
[SPEAKER_04]: How cartoonish of you.

1201
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:19,487
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1202
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:20,749
[SPEAKER_13]: What'd you say?

1203
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:21,509
[SPEAKER_13]: What'd you say?

1204
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:28,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, like I was saying, we're going to try to get things started as soon as possible.

1205
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:31,259
[SPEAKER_13]: That morning we're going to have an official time release on the site soon.

1206
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,746
[SPEAKER_13]: For people who are wanting to see it, just go to sakbemani.com and click on the link to Shaft on the main bar.

1207
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Jamie Schaft and you'll see all about... You can shut up about that already.

1208
00:58:44,008 --> 00:58:46,668
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're... But we like... You remember, you were in deep shit.

1209
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:51,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you're in, like, boiling diarrhea.

1210
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:51,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1211
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:52,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Milk.

1212
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

1213
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Lactose intolerance much?

1214
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm allergic to it, too.

1215
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:58,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care.

1216
00:58:58,652 --> 00:59:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway... We're trying to promote Schaft here, not have people run away screaming, holding their...

1217
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:04,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. T, I pity the fool!

1218
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, and remember, Mr. T supports Shaft.

1219
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,224
[SPEAKER_13]: He pities the foo who don't go to Shaft.

1220
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,286
[SPEAKER_13]: He's on the site with his orange afro.

1221
00:59:31,386 --> 00:59:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1222
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:33,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you ought to ask an incentive.

1223
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:36,470
[SPEAKER_04]: An extra tenth of a point to anyone who dresses up.

1224
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:43,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, people will get an extra tenth of a percentile point added if they have the following items.

1225
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:48,779
[SPEAKER_13]: They dress up like an A-Team member or they wear an orange afro.

1226
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:49,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1227
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:51,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Only orange?

1228
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:52,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Only orange?

1229
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:53,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Stand by to win.

1230
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:54,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1231
00:59:55,594 --> 00:59:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1232
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: What about red?

1233
00:59:57,256 --> 00:59:57,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange.

1234
00:59:57,996 --> 00:59:58,297
Why?

1235
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:00,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's the Wow Wow 70s.

1236
01:00:00,499 --> 01:00:02,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And Orange Lounge is sponsoring the tournament.

1237
01:00:03,962 --> 01:00:08,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, you know, if you wear a little, you know, French girly dress and push a shopping cart around.

1238
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:09,406
I'll wear a dress.

1239
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:10,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wear a dress.

1240
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:10,767
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1241
01:00:11,088 --> 01:00:12,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1242
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, people named Eric are disqualified.

1243
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:14,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1244
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1245
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1246
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:21,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about 18 Freestyle.

1247
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:21,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1248
01:00:21,677 --> 01:00:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1249
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:30,191
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still recording.

1250
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

1251
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:31,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, here.

1252
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:33,573
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it recording?

1253
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:35,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1254
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:39,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And we dropped the microphone, the player thingy, fucking thing.

1255
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:40,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead air, dead air.

1256
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:41,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to Shaft.

1257
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:48,583
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you didn't think you could fuck up this show with two microphones and a tape recorder, but, you know, anything's possible.

1258
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have that, like, stand by.

1259
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:54,787
[SPEAKER_04]: We're experiencing technical difficulties.

1260
01:00:56,809 --> 01:00:58,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just loop stand by to win.

1261
01:00:58,971 --> 01:00:59,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1262
01:01:01,093 --> 01:01:02,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're back from the break.

1263
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:03,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, yes.

1264
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:07,314
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, the A-Team rules should be posted.

1265
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:12,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to go ahead and give people an idea, though, we are putting the bars back on the machine for A-Team Freestyle.

1266
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:13,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you have to.

1267
01:01:13,275 --> 01:01:18,036
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the interest of being old school, the A-Team Freestyle, we're thinking, is going to be on the fourth mix.

1268
01:01:18,156 --> 01:01:20,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be the regular bar, it's going to be my bar.

1269
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:22,617
[SPEAKER_03]: A.K.A.

1270
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,297
[SPEAKER_03]: your shaft?

1271
01:01:24,517 --> 01:01:26,037
[SPEAKER_13]: You are encouraged to rape the bar.

1272
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:27,918
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

1273
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:28,938
[SPEAKER_13]: You are encouraged...

1274
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:36,736
[SPEAKER_13]: 2 Knee Drop, Hand Plant, but we ask, we ask, please no Matrix Walking.

1275
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, we demand it because, you know.

1276
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:42,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And we encourage getting bloody knees on the screws, Jamie style.

1277
01:01:43,062 --> 01:01:44,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I still have the scar.

1278
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,565
[SPEAKER_05]: What about my famous butt drop?

1279
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:48,746
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do the butt drop.

1280
01:01:48,786 --> 01:01:49,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do the butt drop.

1281
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be there, though.

1282
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:52,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1283
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:52,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1284
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck.

1285
01:01:55,307 --> 01:01:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the day off!

1286
01:01:57,508 --> 01:01:59,689
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

1287
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran into Derek at work the other day.

1288
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through his line.

1289
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:05,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Just completely random.

1290
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: At Targay.

1291
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:07,933
[SPEAKER_13]: You work at Targay.

1292
01:02:08,994 --> 01:02:11,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm an only straight cashier.

1293
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it.

1294
01:02:12,856 --> 01:02:13,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there before.

1295
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: My God.

1296
01:02:14,737 --> 01:02:18,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the guys that work there are just... They had to be selling firewood.

1297
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

1298
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:26,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, hi.

1299
01:02:27,959 --> 01:02:32,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, going from one topic to the other, you know, the gay cashiers at Target to Shaft.

1300
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:32,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1301
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:40,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, just to go ahead and give a brief recap, we're going to have freestyle on both machines.

1302
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:45,965
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for all of you people who are listening on Sunday in the future for us in the current day for you.

1303
01:02:48,027 --> 01:03:00,871
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to be running fourth mix freestyle first, so make sure that you decide on your song at registration or pre-registration so that we can make sure that we have the machine set up for you.

1304
01:03:01,352 --> 01:03:07,394
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's going to be no changing your mind once we get to the machine unless the song happens to be in that machine.

1305
01:03:07,414 --> 01:03:08,174
[SPEAKER_06]: You lay down the law.

1306
01:03:09,134 --> 01:03:11,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn straight, or damn gay.

1307
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:13,636
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them two.

1308
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:17,688
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing we should talk about Shaft.

1309
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have door prizes out the ass at Shaft.

1310
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:24,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that's going to be thanks to the big Shaft right here.

1311
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:25,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt himself.

1312
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:29,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about some of the lovely door prizes people can expect to see at Shaft.

1313
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:34,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You can expect to see a whole bunch of DVDs provided by ADV Films.

1314
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, lots of DVDs to be had.

1315
01:03:40,138 --> 01:03:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of DVDs.

1316
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you bribing people to come here?

1317
01:03:44,184 --> 01:03:46,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but there will be lots and lots of DVDs.

1318
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:48,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots and lots.

1319
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:54,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what about tapes for those people living in the Dark Age still?

1320
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of DVDs.

1321
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose I could provide some tapes.

1322
01:03:59,454 --> 01:04:00,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can do that.

1323
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,336
[SPEAKER_02]: But you shouldn't be living in the Dark Ages.

1324
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:03,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Come out.

1325
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:05,278
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want a LaserDisc.

1326
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Come out and get some Shaft.

1327
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Come to Shaft.

1328
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. T ate my balls.

1329
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:13,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Dun dun dun!

1330
01:04:38,797 --> 01:04:39,638
[SPEAKER_13]: We know what the prize is.

1331
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:40,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

1332
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:41,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1333
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1334
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

1335
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:44,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big prizes.

1336
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:45,103
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want them.

1337
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:49,808
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also going to be having a demonstration the day of tournament.

1338
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:51,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these door prizes?

1339
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,832
[SPEAKER_13]: These are actual winning prizes.

1340
01:04:54,592 --> 01:04:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

1341
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:55,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it.

1342
01:04:56,614 --> 01:04:57,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

1343
01:04:57,915 --> 01:04:58,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you.

1344
01:04:59,042 --> 01:04:59,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I want door prizes.

1345
01:04:59,783 --> 01:05:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not providing door prizes.

1346
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:05,147
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are going to also be having a special secret demo that day.

1347
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:08,930
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a special demo set up of something secret.

1348
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:09,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1349
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Something super.

1350
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:13,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Something extreme.

1351
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:15,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1352
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:18,037
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not telling, so don't even guess.

1353
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wasn't going to guess.

1354
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:28,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say about that new DDR, if you notice the logo, it's spelled ErkStream.

1355
01:05:29,085 --> 01:05:30,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Not X-Stream.

1356
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: The R is before the X. Look at the logo.

1357
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR ErkStream.

1358
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:34,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yeah, it is the prescription symbol.

1359
01:05:34,986 --> 01:05:35,967
[SPEAKER_04]: The R and the X cross.

1360
01:05:36,327 --> 01:05:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a drug game.

1361
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:38,707
[SPEAKER_05]: They're promoting drug usage.

1362
01:05:39,127 --> 01:05:39,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1363
01:05:40,328 --> 01:05:42,248
[SPEAKER_04]: They're promoting drug usage.

1364
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: They're promoting just the Ray Bars.

1365
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:45,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I by a bathroom because it smells like shit?

1366
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:45,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at this.

1367
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:46,829
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a clown door.

1368
01:05:46,869 --> 01:05:47,629
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little penny door.

1369
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:50,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, train wreck radio.

1370
01:05:53,186 --> 01:05:54,007
That was a car.

1371
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:55,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to Shaft.

1372
01:05:55,688 --> 01:05:56,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut your mouth.

1373
01:05:56,528 --> 01:05:57,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I feel so good, Jamie.

1374
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:58,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1375
01:06:00,431 --> 01:06:01,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, back to Shaft.

1376
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:10,517
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also planning, assuming that I can find one, we are having special trophies for our A-Team Freestyle winners.

1377
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:16,241
[SPEAKER_13]: We are going to have, as a trophy...

1378
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:18,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Secret prizes.

1379
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:29,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could, you know, I mean, I'm sure I'll be able to provide, like, you know, bronze replicas of certain things if you need for that.

1380
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of job are you running on the side, Loki?

1381
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:36,789
[SPEAKER_13]: We give him a gold picture of Samuel.

1382
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:40,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Orange Lounge Radio.

1383
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,450
[SPEAKER_06]: All they ever do is tell potty jokes.

1384
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:44,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Pencils rage!

1385
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:51,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so all of you have to come to Shaft or I'll hunt you down and kick your ass.

1386
01:06:52,414 --> 01:06:54,698
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember, I know where you live, I saw it on the internet.

1387
01:06:58,484 --> 01:07:01,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's change gears completely, if you don't turn your ass, Shaft.

1388
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:04,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about another game I just got to play for the first time.

1389
01:07:04,493 --> 01:07:07,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial D. No, not Initial D. Drum Mania 7th Mix.

1390
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not broken.

1391
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,478
[SPEAKER_04]: But Guitar Freaks 8th Mix is.

1392
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:12,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

1393
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's our other universal, fuck you to Roseville, Goughlin.

1394
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:17,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Bite our ass.

1395
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:18,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

1396
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:22,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything that you enjoyed about Drum Mania 7th Mix?

1397
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:26,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I enjoyed playing Another World, but I hated that it wasn't Gak singing it.

1398
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I can actually pass a song now.

1399
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:31,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Breakdown owned me.

1400
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,262
[SPEAKER_05]: The video to break down rules.

1401
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:35,502
It's a little girl.

1402
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:37,143
It's so cute.

1403
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:40,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, think about the How to Spring video where you had a little panda.

1404
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool, too.

1405
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandas are cool.

1406
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, well, you know, all the girls doing... That's not cool?

1407
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with you?

1408
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:52,647
[SPEAKER_04]: They did put in a new panda song in there, though.

1409
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:55,189
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the one that's got the heart in the front and the back.

1410
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:55,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it says.

1411
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know the name of it?

1412
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley doesn't know the name of it.

1413
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody does.

1414
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:05,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a girl riding on a silver surfer board type thing, and there's two pandas flying with her.

1415
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:06,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty neat.

1416
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:08,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Silver surfer was cool.

1417
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:09,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1418
01:08:10,098 --> 01:08:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

1419
01:08:11,058 --> 01:08:12,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You said the silver surfboard.

1420
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:13,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

1421
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:13,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So?

1422
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:14,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

1423
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

1424
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:15,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

1425
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

1426
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:16,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Dork.

1427
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

1428
01:08:17,422 --> 01:08:17,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Dork.

1429
01:08:18,564 --> 01:08:20,705
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great radio, ladies and gentlemen.

1430
01:08:21,845 --> 01:08:22,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Orange Lounge radio.

1431
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: All they ever do is fight.

1432
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Diary, I listened to this show today called Orange Lounge.

1433
01:08:28,107 --> 01:08:29,827
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I hate Orange Lounge.

1434
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:31,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Those little girls are stealing all my fender.

1435
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:38,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, that's the radio show and not the... Dear Diary, today I got a new hairdo.

1436
01:08:40,931 --> 01:08:41,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh.

1437
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Diary, kill me now.

1438
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:43,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1439
01:08:44,632 --> 01:08:48,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally off the topic here, but on the fourth mix...

1440
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Felatio, it almost owned me.

1441
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Felatio?

1442
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:55,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Felatio almost owned me there.

1443
01:08:55,505 --> 01:08:57,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody owns me.

1444
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:58,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Felatio, what?

1445
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kicked Pink Taco's ass.

1446
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Felatio always owns me.

1447
01:09:05,452 --> 01:09:07,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1448
01:09:07,454 --> 01:09:08,454
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that?

1449
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:10,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

1450
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:11,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.

1451
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:14,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know what?

1452
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:22,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be me.

1453
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:24,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna get hit.

1454
01:09:24,925 --> 01:09:28,507
[SPEAKER_04]: My idea of what can make this show better, let's all get drunk and then do it.

1455
01:09:29,368 --> 01:09:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually planning a drunk show.

1456
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever the next three-day weekend is, we're doing the drunk show.

1457
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know when that is for Jamie and I when we both have a holiday.

1458
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:38,414
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll find one.

1459
01:09:38,814 --> 01:09:40,135
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll make one if we have to.

1460
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:44,318
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting eggnog.

1461
01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:46,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's eggnog radio.

1462
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm allergic to that too because it's got dairy crap in it.

1463
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:51,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you can just drink tequila.

1464
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:52,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to do that.

1465
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:53,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't drank in six months.

1466
01:09:53,345 --> 01:09:54,826
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give you a whiskey enema.

1467
01:09:55,347 --> 01:09:56,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I drank last night.

1468
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:58,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Red Bull.

1469
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an alcoholic.

1470
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,252
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Red Bull mixed with Malibu is really good.

1471
01:10:03,372 --> 01:10:04,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds gross.

1472
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:04,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Bull is nasty.

1473
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:05,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it a pebble.

1474
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:09,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pebbles or pebble.

1475
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:12,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, a dyke made it, so it might have been Pebbles.

1476
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:13,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you were just too drunk to know.

1477
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:21,830
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, Red Bull, if you pour it into a clear glass, it is the color of urine.

1478
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:26,312
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends says that Red Bull smells like pussy.

1479
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:26,892
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1480
01:10:28,113 --> 01:10:32,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first of all, I don't bend over to smell my own, you know.

1481
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:35,296
[SPEAKER_04]: If pussy smelled that good, I'd eat it every day.

1482
01:10:36,276 --> 01:10:37,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna need a pussy bag.

1483
01:10:37,517 --> 01:10:37,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1484
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:43,360
[SPEAKER_13]: To quote Rob, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.

1485
01:10:46,463 --> 01:10:46,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Well.

1486
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:54,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I can just go around going cock, cock, cock, cock.

1487
01:10:55,972 --> 01:10:57,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say the C-bomb on here?

1488
01:10:57,573 --> 01:10:57,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1489
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:58,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Cunt.

1490
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,175
Cunt.

1491
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,401
[SPEAKER_04]: This is adult content.

1492
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:05,121
[SPEAKER_04]: This is adult content.

1493
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Recess?

1494
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought recess was like 6, right?

1495
01:11:29,681 --> 01:11:31,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I never said fucking when I was like 6.

1496
01:11:31,522 --> 01:11:33,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bathroom humor.

1497
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, we cater to 7 year olds.

1498
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:37,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Poopy!

1499
01:11:37,665 --> 01:11:38,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Freak Poopy!

1500
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:41,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Doggy Doo!

1501
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:43,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hear it for the DDR free filters.

1502
01:11:44,249 --> 01:11:44,549
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1503
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:46,430
[SPEAKER_13]: The most fun filters in the world.

1504
01:11:47,222 --> 01:11:49,164
[SPEAKER_13]: We have more candy.

1505
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:50,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

1506
01:11:50,245 --> 01:11:51,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody dance!

1507
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:53,548
[SPEAKER_13]: This is fun!

1508
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,572
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they can't see us dance on the radio.

1509
01:11:59,973 --> 01:12:01,475
[SPEAKER_13]: My anus is bleeding!

1510
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:03,597
[SPEAKER_09]: For the love of God!

1511
01:12:03,897 --> 01:12:05,458
[SPEAKER_09]: My anus is bleeding!

1512
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,701
[SPEAKER_09]: My anus is bleeding!

1513
01:12:10,795 --> 01:12:14,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention these tape shows tend to get a little too weird?

1514
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to remind our listeners that as they're signing off.

1515
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still off topic, huh?

1516
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:25,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money.

1517
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that makes sense.

1518
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.

1519
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:31,055
[SPEAKER_04]: How about 8th Style coming out this week, hitting some places finally?

1520
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:33,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything's off the damn boat.

1521
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:35,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my FU of the week.

1522
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:42,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to the longshoremen people who aren't working right now because we need stuff off a boat like our 8th style machine.

1523
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitches.

1524
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we just go do it ourselves?

1525
01:12:45,022 --> 01:12:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitches.

1526
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: You go and we'll be right behind you.

1527
01:12:47,403 --> 01:12:50,625
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get a dolly, I'll push that bitch here.

1528
01:12:50,685 --> 01:12:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm not working.

1529
01:12:51,466 --> 01:12:52,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ship that baby on in.

1530
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:55,008
[SPEAKER_04]: To your house, baby.

1531
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:55,968
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll guide it to shaft.

1532
01:12:59,344 --> 01:13:04,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, during the break, I was over kind of looking at the balloon blowing up machine where our 2DX machine's going to be.

1533
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Just admiring the space.

1534
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:10,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you start air playing?

1535
01:13:10,571 --> 01:13:11,431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not that sick.

1536
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:11,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.

1537
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:14,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, my child?

1538
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Where?

1539
01:13:16,194 --> 01:13:16,654
My trunk.

1540
01:13:17,034 --> 01:13:17,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.

1541
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it's Jesus.

1542
01:13:18,855 --> 01:13:19,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Bradley.

1543
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:21,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Savior, you're here.

1544
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:25,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, he's real.

1545
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:29,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a message for you.

1546
01:13:30,477 --> 01:13:31,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to hell.

1547
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,421
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a special place in for you in hell.

1548
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:39,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, I'm taking over hell.

1549
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:44,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, as heard in the intro to this very show.

1550
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:46,729
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother resides in hell.

1551
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,672
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm taking over hell.

1552
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:52,773

[SPEAKER_05]: Just fuck CCL and their fucking racist people.

1564
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:20,190
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

01:14:20,991 --> 01:14:21,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1566
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:29,405
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the dudes told my friend he was a Nazi bastard, and then this big huge black guy told me to fuck myself.

1567
01:14:30,086 --> 01:14:32,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I said that their machine took my coins.

1568
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,871
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, well, fuck you.

1569
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:37,592
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the police?

1570
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:38,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1571
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:39,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1572
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:40,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you go tell the manager?

1573
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I reported it that night.

1574
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got suspended for like two, three weeks or something.

1575
01:14:45,324 --> 01:14:45,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

1576
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:47,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And then his fat ass is back again.

1577
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he's really nice to me and smiles and waves.

1578
01:14:51,389 --> 01:14:51,829
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, then.

1579
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:53,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet he talks shit behind your back, though.

1580
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody does.

1581
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys probably do, too.

1582
01:14:57,934 --> 01:14:58,514
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that guy.

1583
01:14:58,534 --> 01:14:59,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1584
01:14:59,055 --> 01:15:00,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we let Fatty on the show tonight.

1585
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:03,298
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not that fat.

1586
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:04,639
[SPEAKER_13]: You never heard about my issue with CTO.

[SPEAKER_13]: This is how the video goes.

1642
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:08,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Who'd want to put their hands on Shane O'Connor?

1643
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:11,470
[SPEAKER_13]: There's flowers in the background, and look, I'm Shane O'Connor, and I'm dancing.

1644
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:12,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Boy, I can't dance.

01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:28,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Balani related.

[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if we see the reflex on there.

1659
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:33,659
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, this sucked.

1660
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:34,200
[SPEAKER_13]: It worked today.

1661
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,961
[SPEAKER_13]: I had nothing but Duran Duran songs stuck in my head.

1662
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:39,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I was sitting at my desk singing the reflex.

1663
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:43,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see the reflex, but I saw a view to a kill.

1664
01:17:44,904 --> 01:17:46,025
[SPEAKER_04]: On the way here, I heard Rio.

1665
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:47,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1666
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:48,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1667
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:49,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Eighties after eight.

1668
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, this is what I started.

1669
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:57,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I was sitting at my desk, and I started singing the reflex, and the girl, the temp who sits behind me, started singing it with me.

1670
01:17:58,065 --> 01:18:02,269
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were both sitting at our desks singing the reflex while the rest of the office was looking at us.

1671
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to run outside real fast.

1672
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be back.

1673
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys take over the show.

1674
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:08,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Take over.

1675
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:09,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Dun, dun, dun.

[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

1679
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:20,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, my name is Rob and... You don't sound gay enough.

1680
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:21,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

1681
01:18:22,233 --> 01:18:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too gay.

1682
01:18:23,914 --> 01:18:24,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1683
01:18:25,615 --> 01:18:26,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just talk normal then.

1684
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:26,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1685
01:18:27,296 --> 01:18:27,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Brad.

1686
01:18:28,176 --> 01:18:28,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

1687
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:29,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Shh, I'm Rob.

1688
01:18:31,118 --> 01:18:31,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, anyway.

1689
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:33,900
[SPEAKER_19]: So how's this stuff, this Propel water?

1690
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:34,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Propel owns me.

1691
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:36,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid.

1692
01:18:36,882 --> 01:18:37,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghetto Kool-Aid?

1693
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with too much sugar or too much water?

1694
01:18:39,563 --> 01:18:40,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Too much sugar.

1695
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:47,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not mean to explode people's speakers.

1696
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:49,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I just looked out the window and there was Rob.

1697
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is back.

1698
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:53,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob is coming.

1699
01:18:53,682 --> 01:18:54,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob's coming.

1700
01:18:54,302 --> 01:18:55,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob's coming.

1701
01:18:57,884 --> 01:18:59,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I left my bag outside.

1702
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to get it before somebody stole it.

1703
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:03,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this isn't a nice neighborhood.

1704
01:19:04,668 --> 01:19:07,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, some guy proposed to me in this neighborhood.

1705
01:19:08,306 --> 01:19:08,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1706
01:19:08,947 --> 01:19:11,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I was walking to Scandia.

1707
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: This was, you know, about a month ago.

1708
01:19:13,652 --> 01:19:15,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was going to talk to Keith about things.

1709
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:18,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Kundagi, for people who know him online.

1710
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:20,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And this old guy comes out of this garden.

1711
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:28,849
[SPEAKER_13]: And he comes up to me and hands me a flower and says, You know, you...

1712
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,035
[SPEAKER_13]: A flower in the weed garden.

1713
01:19:33,076 --> 01:19:34,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you need a husband?

1714
01:19:35,077 --> 01:19:36,037
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one, thank you.

1715
01:19:36,678 --> 01:19:39,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And I walked really fast.

1716
01:19:40,299 --> 01:19:41,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You power walked your way out of that.

1717
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I power walked my way out of that.

1718
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:45,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Some dude tried to propose to me.

1719
01:19:45,942 --> 01:19:46,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, first of all.

1720
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:51,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Where, what neighborhood is this again?

1721
01:19:51,905 --> 01:19:52,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello?

1722
01:19:53,506 --> 01:19:57,007
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm here, big honky girl in the middle of, you know.

1723
01:19:57,027 --> 01:19:57,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are we?

1724
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:01,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Madison and Aidy.

1725
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:02,842
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Hillsdale.

1726
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:13,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate when my balls stick to the side of my leg.

1727
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need to hear this.

1728
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:21,172
[SPEAKER_03]: They get sweaty.

1729
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:26,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I can't believe you missed Survivor to come to this show.

1730
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:28,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not missing Survivor because I own a TiVo.

1731
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:30,918
[SPEAKER_04]: and those things are the shit.

1732
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:32,758
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1733
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, if you ruin it for me, I will never forgive you either.

1734
01:20:39,621 --> 01:20:39,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

1735
01:20:40,221 --> 01:20:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1736
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not listening, I'm not listening.

1737
01:20:43,322 --> 01:20:45,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Mr. DJ.

1738
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:46,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Mr. DJ.

1739
01:20:48,484 --> 01:20:49,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Only the Market Show fans would get that.

1740
01:20:51,002 --> 01:20:55,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was here in Sacramento last week, by the way, but I missed it because I'm poor.

1741
01:20:55,686 --> 01:20:58,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so poor.

1742
01:20:58,688 --> 01:20:59,488
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's me.

1743
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:00,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I could have gone.

1744
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm poorer than you.

1745
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:04,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play who's poorest.

1746
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:05,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, whip it out, dude.

1747
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:07,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to see you.

1748
01:21:08,095 --> 01:21:08,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay.

1749
01:21:08,675 --> 01:21:10,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to see you whip it out.

1750
01:21:10,577 --> 01:21:12,178
[SPEAKER_11]: No, whip out your wallet.

1751
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:12,998
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1752
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:14,960
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1753
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe money.

1754
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:16,401
[SPEAKER_04]: No change.

1755
01:21:17,322 --> 01:21:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah?

1756
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:18,362
[SPEAKER_05]: No dollars.

1757
01:21:18,963 --> 01:21:20,324
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I have bills to pay.

1758
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:24,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, looks like somebody's not as poor as I am.

1759
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:25,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wait, wait.

1760
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:25,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I have $19.

1761
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,291
[SPEAKER_19]: You're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy.

1762
01:21:29,391 --> 01:21:30,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Bradley, you're a boy?

1763
01:21:30,492 --> 01:21:32,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Bradley has a source of income.

1764
01:21:32,973 --> 01:21:33,273
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't.

1765
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:34,994
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a whore.

1766
01:21:35,014 --> 01:21:36,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley's really an international spy.

1767
01:21:36,315 --> 01:21:37,615
[SPEAKER_11]: You have no money and no job?

1768
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:38,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck.

1769
01:21:38,616 --> 01:21:38,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I lose.

1770
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1771
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:42,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that quote.

1772
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:44,783
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean you have no money and no job?

1773
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.

1774
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:47,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad wins an eagle, sir.

1775
01:21:47,725 --> 01:21:49,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad wins a forest, yay.

01:21:49,886 --> 01:21:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: He gets an autographed napkin.

1777
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:56,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you win a lovely autographed piece of fecal matter.

1778
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:57,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone give me a napkin.

1779
01:21:57,952 --> 01:21:59,473
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I get evicted is what I get.

1780
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,860
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he won an autographed eviction notice by his landlord.

1781
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:10,661
[SPEAKER_13]: And now here's the prize.

1782
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jamie's autographing this right now.

[SPEAKER_04]: By Dark Sakura.

1786
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to sign it too.

1787
01:22:31,524 --> 01:22:35,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is writing something because his hand's in the way.

1788
01:22:35,628 --> 01:22:39,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Brad, I secretly am harboring a fetish for you.

1789
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:46,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, wait.

1790
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:49,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you have to show Jamie what I wrote.

1791
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,220
[SPEAKER_11]: He wrote penis.

1792
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:52,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry about penis.

1793
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:56,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Penis!

1794
01:22:56,726 --> 01:22:57,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like candy heart.

1795
01:22:57,847 --> 01:22:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: It's penis heart.

1796
01:22:58,667 --> 01:22:58,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1797
01:22:59,348 --> 01:22:59,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1798
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the next mix, in DDR Extreme, we'll have Penis Star.

1799
01:23:04,823 --> 01:23:05,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Penis Star.

01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:07,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's Vagina Heart.

1801
01:23:10,506 --> 01:23:11,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Trainwreck!

1802
01:23:12,647 --> 01:23:13,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash!

1803
01:23:16,269 --> 01:23:17,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you look really tired.

1804
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:17,930
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong?

1805
01:23:20,191 --> 01:23:21,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really tired!

1806
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:26,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew about what?

1807
01:23:27,615 --> 01:23:28,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That he was tired.

1808
01:23:30,091 --> 01:23:31,372
[SPEAKER_04]: What songs did you just play?

1809
01:23:31,392 --> 01:23:32,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a secret to everyone.

1810
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:32,853
[SPEAKER_04]: What edits?

1811
01:23:32,913 --> 01:23:33,933
[SPEAKER_04]: What fun edits were you playing?

1812
01:23:34,113 --> 01:23:36,175
[SPEAKER_02]: What dirty themed edits did you play this time?

1813
01:23:36,575 --> 01:23:37,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play edits.

1814
01:23:38,256 --> 01:23:38,556
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1815
01:23:39,116 --> 01:23:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Boom Boom Dollar Maniac Doubles, and then I played Wonderland Maniac, and then I played Nizibutu Maniac Doubles.

1816
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:48,302
[SPEAKER_02]: What a bootylicious mix.

1817
01:23:49,163 --> 01:23:50,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Shake that booty.

1818
01:23:50,263 --> 01:23:50,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

1819
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:55,706
[SPEAKER_13]: There's tokens in that game over there.

1820
01:23:55,726 --> 01:23:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: What game?

1821
01:23:56,767 --> 01:23:57,047
Fourth.

1822
01:23:57,768 --> 01:23:57,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1823
01:23:58,108 --> 01:23:59,349
[SPEAKER_13]: There's tokens in fourth mix.

1824
01:23:59,429 --> 01:23:59,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey.

1825
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:01,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Three-hole one?

1826
01:24:02,581 --> 01:24:02,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1827
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:03,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Three-hole critter?

1828
01:24:03,741 --> 01:24:06,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, let's take the show to the fourth mix machine.

1829
01:24:06,063 --> 01:24:07,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go over to the fourth mix machine.

1830
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, there's a lot of crazy kids on there.

1831
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Experimental and sucky radio.

1832
01:24:14,609 --> 01:24:15,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, this radio doesn't suck.

1833
01:24:18,772 --> 01:24:19,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Brad left his napkin.

1834
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:21,334
[SPEAKER_04]: What an ungrateful little bastard.

1835
01:24:21,354 --> 01:24:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1836
01:24:22,815 --> 01:24:23,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back here.

1837
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm grabbing this napkin.

1838
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to beat Brad over the head with it.

1839
01:24:27,571 --> 01:24:28,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1840
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:29,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to put it in the back here.

1841
01:24:30,192 --> 01:24:31,133
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great radio.

1842
01:24:31,473 --> 01:24:32,273
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week, Jamie?

1843
01:24:32,994 --> 01:24:34,535
[SPEAKER_13]: My week was interesting.

1844
01:24:35,095 --> 01:24:35,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really.

1845
01:24:35,955 --> 01:24:36,356
[SPEAKER_13]: I worked.

1846
01:24:37,316 --> 01:24:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.

1847
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:40,678
[SPEAKER_13]: We apparently got people crowded around the machine.

1848
01:24:40,698 --> 01:24:41,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, we got people.

1849
01:24:41,378 --> 01:24:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: This is weird.

1850
01:24:41,919 --> 01:24:42,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.

1851
01:24:42,799 --> 01:24:45,481
[SPEAKER_04]: One person on Max 2 and a whole crowd around 4th Mix.

1852
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:46,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Take the microphone.

1853
01:24:46,621 --> 01:24:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1854
01:24:47,902 --> 01:24:49,123
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many little kids.

1855
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kill them.

1856
01:24:51,264 --> 01:24:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what we're going to do right now, we're going to go ahead.

1857
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:55,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, where's the clock?

1858
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It said like 34 or something.

1859
01:24:58,274 --> 01:24:58,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1860
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:00,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go ahead and go to break.

1861
01:25:01,036 --> 01:25:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will come back.

1862
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:04,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to play more DDR.

1863
01:25:04,518 --> 01:25:06,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and we're going to wrap up the show in one more segment.

1864
01:25:06,459 --> 01:25:07,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So please stay tuned.

1865
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hungry.

1866
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, do you have a final thought, Loki?

1867
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,862
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want, Matt?

1868
01:25:12,182 --> 01:25:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

1869
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:13,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, question.

1870
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people does it take to play versus mode in fourth mix?

1871
01:25:18,466 --> 01:25:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're three or six, it looks like five.

1872
01:25:20,047 --> 01:25:21,368
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're that young, five.

1873
01:25:23,049 --> 01:25:26,191
[SPEAKER_04]: One to press the button and one for each of the little arrows.

1874
01:25:27,358 --> 01:25:29,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go to a break.

1875
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:30,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

1876
01:25:30,503 --> 01:25:30,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1877
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:44,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound of Speed Are you ready?

1878
01:27:45,114 --> 01:27:47,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Ready for the race, are you ready?

1879
01:27:48,135 --> 01:27:48,675
Are you ready?

1880
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Ready for the race, are you ready?

1881
01:27:58,801 --> 01:27:59,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you ready?

1882
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:00,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you ready?

1883
01:29:41,614 --> 01:29:43,364
The Wraith, From Outer Space

1884
01:30:28,213 --> 01:30:31,307
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a journey into the sound of speed.

1885
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:23,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're coming back from break, and Jamie wanted to show off, so she's getting on Max 2 right now.

1886
01:31:23,048 --> 01:31:24,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, why are you picking this song?

1887
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:25,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because it's fun.

1888
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think it's overplayed to all hell?

1889
01:31:27,812 --> 01:31:28,012
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1890
01:31:30,454 --> 01:31:31,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's that.

1891
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:34,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking that microphone away.

1892
01:31:34,777 --> 01:31:35,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting all tangled up.

1893
01:31:38,499 --> 01:31:40,720
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be amazing for our listeners.

1894
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to be blown away.

1895
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:45,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read off Jamie's combo.

1896
01:31:45,062 --> 01:31:45,822
[SPEAKER_04]: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, boom.

1897
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:46,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

1898
01:31:46,742 --> 01:31:47,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

1899
01:31:47,122 --> 01:31:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, boom.

[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great, perfect.

4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21.

1904
01:31:56,568 --> 01:31:57,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what about this weekend?

1905
01:31:57,548 --> 01:31:58,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we going to be doing?

1906
01:31:59,009 --> 01:31:59,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, back to the song.

1907
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:00,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, perfect.

1908
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:00,150
24, 25.

1909
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:00,150
9, 11.

01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.

01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: 4, 5.

1912
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: She's doing Riverdance.

1913
01:32:01,231 --> 01:32:01,311
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1914
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:01,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong?

1915
01:32:24,847 --> 01:32:25,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Her pants are stupid.

1916
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:27,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your pants going to fall off while you're playing Kakumei?

1917
01:32:28,428 --> 01:32:28,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

1918
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:30,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy that for a dollar.

1919
01:32:35,331 --> 01:32:37,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on to the bar for dear life, Jamie.

1920
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:38,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell no.

1921
01:32:39,192 --> 01:32:40,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no is right.

1922
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:45,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think this video is so generic?

1923
01:32:45,814 --> 01:32:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this video.

1924
01:32:46,654 --> 01:32:46,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1925
01:32:46,754 --> 01:32:49,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like flashing squares, flashing blocks.

1926
01:32:49,195 --> 01:32:49,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a rave.

1927
01:32:49,815 --> 01:32:50,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Flashing squares.

1928
01:32:51,456 --> 01:32:52,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so fucked up.

1929
01:32:55,473 --> 01:32:56,414
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that song?

1930
01:32:56,694 --> 01:32:58,455
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that animation supposed to be?

1931
01:32:58,515 --> 01:33:03,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, ooh, I'm flying through a tunnel of color, and there's colored boxes.

1932
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:04,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a birth canal.

1933
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:05,239
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like a tunnel.

1934
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Jamie.

1935
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:07,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

1936
01:33:09,062 --> 01:33:09,562
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

1937
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:11,023
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

1938
01:33:13,144 --> 01:33:13,685
[SPEAKER_07]: She passed.

1939
01:33:13,785 --> 01:33:16,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, how does it feel to be a winner?

1940
01:33:16,106 --> 01:33:17,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for falling off me.

1941
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:29,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to point out that Jamie, by the way, has burning feet right now.

1942
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:31,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning feet.

1943
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:32,291
[SPEAKER_04]: She's burning the floor.

1944
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:35,693
[SPEAKER_13]: My pants are too big.

1945
01:33:36,674 --> 01:33:38,415
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was tripping over them the whole time.

1946
01:33:42,759 --> 01:33:43,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Now why this song?

1947
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,280
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Viking Superstar.

1948
01:33:51,825 --> 01:33:52,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, no.

1949
01:33:57,162 --> 01:33:59,062
[SPEAKER_04]: She's playing Love To Me Lite.

1950
01:34:00,703 --> 01:34:06,784
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we can expect to see a lot of... Wait, wait.

1951
01:34:06,864 --> 01:34:08,084
Oh, hell yeah.

1952
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:12,365
Oh, wait a minute.

1953
01:34:15,446 --> 01:34:16,766
[SPEAKER_19]: We fell out again for a minute.

1954
01:34:16,846 --> 01:34:17,666
[SPEAKER_19]: Technical difficulties.

1955
01:34:19,207 --> 01:34:20,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was... I'm so fucking out of breath.

1956
01:34:21,334 --> 01:34:23,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was talking to the microphone pretending like it was plugged in.

1957
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:24,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1958
01:34:24,638 --> 01:34:25,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't I a stupid ass?

1959
01:34:25,579 --> 01:34:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1960
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,081
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to be doing a freestyle.

1961
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:29,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's facing away.

1962
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:31,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's go around to the other side.

1963
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stand next to the carousel.

1964
01:34:35,834 --> 01:34:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing.

1965
01:34:36,915 --> 01:34:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's not even looking.

1966
01:34:38,396 --> 01:34:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who want to check out the webcam and see this going on, you can't.

1967
01:34:42,118 --> 01:34:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can't.

1968
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the address, Rob?

1969
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:50,784
[SPEAKER_04]: www.goatsay.cx Goat say?

1970
01:34:50,824 --> 01:34:51,645
[SPEAKER_04]: What's goat say?

1971
01:34:51,785 --> 01:34:52,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

1972
01:34:54,206 --> 01:34:55,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she got a 50 combo.

1973
01:34:57,168 --> 01:34:57,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.

1974
01:34:58,089 --> 01:34:59,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think she just did a spin.

1975
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:01,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Knee drop, knee drop.

1976
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Knee drop, knee drop.

1977
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,723
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, never mind.

1978
01:35:06,704 --> 01:35:08,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she lost her balance and broke her combo.

1979
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, I shouldn't have said that.

1980
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:12,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1981
01:35:12,788 --> 01:35:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to hurt herself.

1982
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a pretty strong thud there.

1983
01:35:21,032 --> 01:35:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the fourth mix.

1984
01:35:22,393 --> 01:35:23,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what the kids are up to on fourth mix.

1985
01:35:23,914 --> 01:35:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to leave Jamie?

1986
01:35:25,215 --> 01:35:25,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll come back.

1987
01:35:25,975 --> 01:35:26,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1988
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:27,116
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a big girl.

1989
01:35:27,136 --> 01:35:27,977
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be okay by herself.

1990
01:35:30,398 --> 01:35:31,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what they're playing over here.

1991
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:31,819
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you doing?

1992
01:35:33,112 --> 01:35:34,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you insane?

1993
01:35:35,414 --> 01:35:36,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is, what is this, Saints?

1994
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:38,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even, oh, it's one of Loki's edits.

1995
01:35:38,797 --> 01:35:39,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Ninja Burrow.

1996
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,961
[SPEAKER_04]: No, oh, it is.

1997
01:35:50,288 --> 01:35:51,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you failed.

1998
01:35:51,249 --> 01:35:51,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you failed.

1999
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:53,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck, Loki.

2000
01:35:53,691 --> 01:35:54,752
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel to suck?

2001
01:35:55,484 --> 01:35:55,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

2002
01:35:55,984 --> 01:35:56,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired.

2003
01:35:56,865 --> 01:35:57,605
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hard.

2004
01:35:58,646 --> 01:35:59,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked like it was pretty hard.

2005
01:36:01,587 --> 01:36:02,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all six of those.

2006
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:03,829
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad to do that kind of shit.

2007
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:05,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Game over!

2008
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:06,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulled out.

2009
01:36:08,491 --> 01:36:14,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever noticed that when you put the memory card, it says inserted, and we take it out, it says pulled out?

2010
01:36:14,194 --> 01:36:17,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Naoki is a very perverted person.

2011
01:36:20,077 --> 01:36:22,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2012
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,260
What?

2013
01:36:25,885 --> 01:36:26,406
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you say now?

2014
01:36:26,846 --> 01:36:30,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Even with my thumble, I missed four and got an A. Are you bleeding, Jamie?

2015
01:36:30,549 --> 01:36:31,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not bleeding, are you?

2016
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:35,332
[SPEAKER_04]: She's okay!

2017
01:36:35,592 --> 01:36:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: She's red, but she's okay.

2018
01:36:38,997 --> 01:36:40,118
[SPEAKER_04]: What song is she gonna pick?

2019
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we know you're fat there, you already mentioned it.

2020
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,081
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not that fat!

2021
01:36:43,321 --> 01:36:44,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You're husky, you're husky.

2022
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:47,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably got a bigger belly than you do.

2023
01:36:48,005 --> 01:36:49,386
[SPEAKER_04]: How much, have you lost weight playing DDR?

2024
01:36:49,866 --> 01:36:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how much?

2025
01:36:51,027 --> 01:36:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 40 pounds?

2026
01:36:51,568 --> 01:36:52,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you stop eating fat?

2027
01:36:52,689 --> 01:36:56,092
[SPEAKER_04]: No, see, I lost a bunch of weight when I did wrestling, and then I worked at Jack in the Box, and I got super fat.

2028
01:37:07,014 --> 01:37:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck Jack in the Box and his stupid ass.

2029
01:37:10,036 --> 01:37:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, don't eat Jack in the Box chicken sandwiches.

2030
01:37:12,859 --> 01:37:13,799
[SPEAKER_05]: They drop them on the floor.

2031
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for sharing.

2032
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:22,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, she's spinning the disc.

2033
01:37:25,068 --> 01:37:27,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Now see, this video's pretty cool.

2034
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: People dancing and shit.

2035
01:37:29,512 --> 01:37:30,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it says heat up.

2036
01:37:32,739 --> 01:37:35,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the English they usually have in the background sometimes.

2037
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,481
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say is your favorite movie in all of Max 2?

2038
01:37:39,582 --> 01:37:40,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 2?

2039
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:44,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to go with Tsugaru.

2040
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:47,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Tsugaru?

2041
01:37:48,105 --> 01:37:51,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Those funny-looking bald dudes with the little thing on their head spinning around.

2042
01:37:52,226 --> 01:37:52,807
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny again.

2043
01:37:53,087 --> 01:37:53,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, cool.

2044
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:56,908
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we need to change our mind.

2045
01:37:56,928 --> 01:37:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such great radio.

2046
01:37:58,729 --> 01:37:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: This is better.

2047
01:37:59,189 --> 01:38:01,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to harass the waitress and the interviewer and shit.

2048
01:38:03,345 --> 01:38:04,506
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always next time.

2049
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:05,527
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll probably kick us out.

2050
01:38:06,867 --> 01:38:08,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, some of those waitresses are hella cool.

2051
01:38:09,329 --> 01:38:11,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but last time when we were at Golf Land.

2052
01:38:12,091 --> 01:38:12,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck Golf Land.

2053
01:38:13,212 --> 01:38:13,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2054
01:38:14,493 --> 01:38:18,896
[SPEAKER_19]: But they have Soul Calibur 2 and Initial D, so... Fuck them all except for those two games.

2055
01:38:20,236 --> 01:38:21,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I bet you they're broken today.

2056
01:38:22,378 --> 01:38:22,698
Yeah.

2057
01:38:23,058 --> 01:38:23,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably.

2058
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:28,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever played this machine, the electrifying machine, the one that shocks you?

2059
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it shock you?

2060
01:38:30,412 --> 01:38:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played it.

2061
01:38:30,993 --> 01:38:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it shocks you.

2062
01:38:32,274 --> 01:38:32,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you serious?

2063
01:38:32,975 --> 01:38:33,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to play it?

2064
01:38:34,436 --> 01:38:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it live on air.

2065
01:38:35,297 --> 01:38:37,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if it will erase the tape.

2066
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:38,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I can't stand too close.

2067
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:42,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it will, but... Sorry, the printer doesn't work.

2068
01:38:42,444 --> 01:38:43,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it four tokens?

2069
01:38:44,006 --> 01:38:45,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, put one in and see how many it wants.

2070
01:38:46,348 --> 01:38:46,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Put one in.

2071
01:38:47,089 --> 01:38:47,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2072
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:49,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it wants four.

2073
01:38:50,933 --> 01:38:52,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you're going to get hella zapped and shit.

2074
01:38:54,108 --> 01:38:57,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright everybody, he's playing the electrifying Uncle Fester, the new adaptation.

2075
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:59,411
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to ask him what it feels like while he's playing.

2076
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:01,852
[SPEAKER_05]: High power, and hold on to both of them.

2077
01:39:02,032 --> 01:39:02,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on to both.

2078
01:39:03,873 --> 01:39:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us the sensation.

2079
01:39:06,395 --> 01:39:06,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready?

2080
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:08,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't let go, don't be a puss.

2081
01:39:10,597 --> 01:39:11,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even on yet.

2082
01:39:15,759 --> 01:39:16,720
[SPEAKER_19]: It's vibrating.

2083
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:19,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel something.

2084
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:19,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, this is kind of nice.

2085
01:39:21,342 --> 01:39:22,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, that's a...

[SPEAKER_04]: We have... Let's see your hands.

2088
01:39:58,659 --> 01:39:59,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it hurt?

2089
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of.

2090
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if it smells like burning flesh.

2091
01:40:07,306 --> 01:40:08,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm in love.

2092
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:11,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how was that vibrating sensation?

2093
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:12,231
[SPEAKER_13]: You should try two-player.

2094
01:40:13,692 --> 01:40:14,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

2095
01:40:14,433 --> 01:40:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, two can play, you just have to hold hands.

2096
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:17,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Owie.

2097
01:40:19,685 --> 01:40:21,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it forms like a circuit.

2098
01:40:21,507 --> 01:40:24,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Only in America would you give a machine a dollar to beat you up.

2099
01:40:25,790 --> 01:40:26,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

2100
01:40:26,511 --> 01:40:28,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got that arm wrestling machine that's broken.

2101
01:40:28,512 --> 01:40:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: What did he get out of that?

2102
01:40:29,533 --> 01:40:31,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing, because the damn printer's broken.

2103
01:40:32,216 --> 01:40:33,076
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I say to that?

2104
01:40:33,096 --> 01:40:34,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I sold my pants.

2105
01:40:34,898 --> 01:40:36,519
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel inclined to go play Afterburner.

2106
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,160
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to go play Afterburner?

2107
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,002
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a working Afterburner here in Sandia.

2108
01:40:40,042 --> 01:40:41,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go play Afterburner.

2109
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we go to play the all-time favorite.

2110
01:40:46,212 --> 01:40:49,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asking, hey Jamie, I'll ask you the same question I asked Brad while you were playing Spin the Disc.

2111
01:40:50,115 --> 01:40:51,877
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say is your favorite Max 2 video?

2112
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:55,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Long Train Runnin'.

2113
01:40:56,109 --> 01:40:57,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Long train running, right on.

2114
01:40:57,391 --> 01:40:58,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Just cause the dude looks kinda cool.

2115
01:40:59,013 --> 01:41:03,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say my favorite would be the whistle song, even though it's overplayed, that bunny just rules.

2116
01:41:03,999 --> 01:41:06,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Should I go for the classic afterburner?

2117
01:41:06,842 --> 01:41:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic afterburner.

2118
01:41:08,584 --> 01:41:11,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Or my favorite bicycle game prop cycle?

2119
01:41:12,068 --> 01:41:12,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterburner.

2120
01:41:12,769 --> 01:41:13,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Afterburner.

2121
01:41:14,136 --> 01:41:17,259
[SPEAKER_05]: and the all-time favorite, no, this is Afterburner 2.

2122
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,161
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the sequel.

2123
01:41:19,221 --> 01:41:20,402
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about the sequel?

2124
01:41:20,602 --> 01:41:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an old-school Afterburner machine that actually moves.

2125
01:41:23,705 --> 01:41:24,685
[SPEAKER_04]: You sit in the cockpit.

2126
01:41:25,086 --> 01:41:27,488
[SPEAKER_13]: They need the freaking space harrier.

2127
01:41:28,189 --> 01:41:28,849
[SPEAKER_04]: He said cock.

2128
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:30,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone give me a token.

2129
01:41:31,311 --> 01:41:33,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, honey, go get her a token.

2130
01:41:34,374 --> 01:41:35,415
[SPEAKER_04]: What is she, your bitch?

2131
01:41:35,855 --> 01:41:36,136
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2132
01:41:37,532 --> 01:41:40,434
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about being bossed around by this guy?

2133
01:41:40,474 --> 01:41:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go there.

2134
01:41:41,035 --> 01:41:41,255
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2135
01:41:41,315 --> 01:41:41,555
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2136
01:41:42,716 --> 01:41:43,077
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2137
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:43,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going there.

2138
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:44,598
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going there.

2139
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:45,038
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2140
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:45,379
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2141
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:46,740
[SPEAKER_19]: I just ignore him half the time.

2142
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

2143
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

2144
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:48,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, girl.

2145
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Until about 10 o'clock at night.

2146
01:41:50,383 --> 01:41:52,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Another story.

2147
01:41:53,245 --> 01:41:53,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my.

2148
01:41:53,865 --> 01:41:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to KTMI.

2149
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:01,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sick stream.

2150
01:42:02,813 --> 01:42:03,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd she go?

2151
01:42:03,573 --> 01:42:04,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here she comes.

2152
01:42:04,554 --> 01:42:05,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Here she comes.

2153
01:42:06,232 --> 01:42:07,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Our beautiful Jamie.

2154
01:42:08,753 --> 01:42:09,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, it's a one now.

2155
01:42:09,834 --> 01:42:10,294
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

2156
01:42:10,534 --> 01:42:11,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was two.

2157
01:42:12,075 --> 01:42:13,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I get to hold the purse.

2158
01:42:13,076 --> 01:42:15,157
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's four tokens to play, but it's worth it.

2159
01:42:16,197 --> 01:42:17,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, like, go sideways in this thing.

2160
01:42:17,658 --> 01:42:19,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it, like, vibrate and shit?

2161
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:19,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.

2162
01:42:19,579 --> 01:42:20,059
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens?

2163
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need... Oh, you need... She's strapping on.

2164
01:42:22,981 --> 01:42:23,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in.

2165
01:42:23,641 --> 01:42:24,882
[SPEAKER_05]: She's strapping herself in.

2166
01:42:25,702 --> 01:42:26,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, she isn't.

2167
01:42:26,282 --> 01:42:28,824
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going... Oh, she's going strapless.

2168
01:42:30,705 --> 01:42:32,706
[SPEAKER_05]: No strap on for her tonight.

2169
01:42:34,727 --> 01:42:35,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We need what?

2170
01:42:36,852 --> 01:42:40,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2171
01:42:42,937 --> 01:42:46,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting squishy.

2172
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here you go.

2173
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,241
Get ready.

2174
01:42:48,301 --> 01:42:49,922
It will move, by the way.

2175
01:42:49,942 --> 01:42:51,263
You gotta move back out.

2176
01:42:51,283 --> 01:42:52,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, back out of the way a little.

2177
01:43:02,851 --> 01:43:06,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Look how the monitor like totally bends at a 45 degree angle when she plays.

2178
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:09,156
[SPEAKER_05]: This game kicks Beachhead's 2000's ass.

2179
01:43:24,591 --> 01:43:29,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't have the cool, uh, bubble for the, uh, Sumo, like Sumo has.

2180
01:43:29,454 --> 01:43:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

2181
01:43:29,674 --> 01:43:30,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2182
01:43:30,415 --> 01:43:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Sumo.

2183
01:43:31,816 --> 01:43:33,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, it's old school Sega.

2184
01:43:34,697 --> 01:43:36,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Recording their songs and shit?

2185
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:36,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Nah, fuck em.

2186
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:37,519
[SPEAKER_19]: It's free promotion!

2187
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:38,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Kickstarter too.

2188
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:38,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2189
01:44:11,358 --> 01:44:12,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's reloading.

2190
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:15,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Zappa recharge.

2191
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:17,619
[SPEAKER_04]: She's getting filled.

2192
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,621
[SPEAKER_04]: How come the machine doesn't do loop-de-loops when she does?

2193
01:44:26,401 --> 01:44:28,161
[SPEAKER_05]: How come the machine doesn't blow up when she does?

2194
01:44:28,181 --> 01:44:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you die?

2195
01:44:30,882 --> 01:44:31,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2196
01:44:31,262 --> 01:44:31,882
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it feel?

2197
01:44:31,922 --> 01:44:32,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the rest of your life?

2198
01:44:33,242 --> 01:44:34,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, retro gaming owns.

2199
01:44:35,463 --> 01:44:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play a game.

2200
01:44:36,163 --> 01:44:37,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play the prop cycle.

2201
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:38,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's lesson of the day.

2202
01:44:38,919 --> 01:44:40,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drink 44 ounces of Pepsi and play Cat of Devils all day.

2203
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:02,413
[SPEAKER_13]: How about don't go eat a bunch of Mongolian barbecue and then play three 8-footers in a row?

2204
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:04,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't play double catas anyways.

2205
01:45:04,455 --> 01:45:11,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Last time I was here, I had just gotten done eating Mongo Chow and I played Superstar, Holic, and Spin the Disc all in a row.

2206
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should get some Mike's Hard Lemonade because I think an alien is going to pop out of my chest.

2207
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:16,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good.

2208
01:45:17,331 --> 01:45:19,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, you know, as long as you're actually a real person.

2209
01:45:20,215 --> 01:45:24,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Just drink like 12 of them and in an hour you get really fucked up.

2210
01:45:24,662 --> 01:45:25,443
[SPEAKER_13]: You look drunk already.

2211
01:45:25,783 --> 01:45:27,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki is our sweat elemental.

2212
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And now Rob's going to fly.

2213
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:31,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

2214
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:35,984
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going... I hope that this has actually sound today.

2215
01:45:36,464 --> 01:45:40,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to stipulate that I've never played this game in my entire life.

2216
01:45:40,806 --> 01:45:43,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Pointers, pedal fast.

2217
01:45:44,228 --> 01:45:44,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't run into stuff.

2218
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:47,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And don't be afraid not to pedal to descend.

2219
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:48,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2220
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:50,231
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to steer tightly.

2221
01:45:52,592 --> 01:45:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to do it tight?

2222
01:45:54,013 --> 01:45:54,774
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to be tight.

2223
01:45:54,834 --> 01:45:55,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

2224
01:45:56,138 --> 01:45:56,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it.

2225
01:45:57,159 --> 01:45:58,480
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's no sound on the machine.

2226
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2227
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Go us.

2228
01:46:01,162 --> 01:46:03,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is going for level one.

2229
01:46:04,284 --> 01:46:05,305
[SPEAKER_13]: No, level two.

2230
01:46:05,445 --> 01:46:06,406
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's level one.

2231
01:46:06,586 --> 01:46:06,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Level one.

2232
01:46:06,886 --> 01:46:08,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a finger or a... He's going to cliff rock.

2233
01:46:08,807 --> 01:46:09,668
[SPEAKER_13]: What do I do?

2234
01:46:09,688 --> 01:46:09,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Pedal.

2235
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:10,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Pedal.

2236
01:46:10,669 --> 01:46:11,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do I pedal to?

2237
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You can push into the... Burst the balloons.

2238
01:46:14,632 --> 01:46:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Burst it.

2239
01:46:16,553 --> 01:46:17,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Go run into the balloons.

2240
01:46:17,674 --> 01:46:20,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in case you're supposed to be...

2241
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:25,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to make you feel like you're getting... Never mind.

2242
01:46:25,785 --> 01:46:26,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

2243
01:46:26,566 --> 01:46:27,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just leave that alone.

2244
01:46:27,827 --> 01:46:28,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just wrong.

2245
01:46:28,387 --> 01:46:30,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob's doing pretty good for a beginner, by the way.

2246
01:46:30,248 --> 01:46:31,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's kicking ass.

2247
01:46:31,489 --> 01:46:31,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2248
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:32,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh.

2249
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:32,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you got 200, 100.

2250
01:46:33,091 --> 01:46:33,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2251
01:46:33,371 --> 01:46:33,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that shit.

2252
01:46:33,931 --> 01:46:34,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

2253
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:37,874
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I missed that one.

2254
01:46:37,934 --> 01:46:39,215
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rob has an orgasm.

2255
01:46:39,275 --> 01:46:39,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, I missed one.

2256
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:40,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

2257
01:46:40,276 --> 01:46:40,476
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

2258
01:46:40,496 --> 01:46:40,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep going.

2259
01:46:41,977 --> 01:46:42,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Smash that.

2260
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:43,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit it.

2261
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:45,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

2262
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:48,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a dude on the roof.

2263
01:46:48,122 --> 01:46:48,983
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have killed him.

2264
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:52,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't run in.

2265
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You need that.

2266
01:46:52,959 --> 01:46:53,680
[SPEAKER_13]: That gives you more time.

2267
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, get the shiny balloons.

2268
01:46:56,562 --> 01:46:56,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt.

2269
01:46:58,724 --> 01:47:01,546
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record, Rob is owning at this game for his first time.

2270
01:47:01,566 --> 01:47:03,387
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got an eight perfect balloon run.

2271
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,331
[SPEAKER_13]: He just got two and one.

2272
01:47:08,652 --> 01:47:09,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn around.

2273
01:47:09,152 --> 01:47:10,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get six.

2274
01:47:10,473 --> 01:47:11,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get six more balloons.

2275
01:47:11,934 --> 01:47:12,154
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2276
01:47:14,716 --> 01:47:15,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in the hole.

2277
01:47:16,437 --> 01:47:17,198
[SPEAKER_05]: This is such crap.

2278
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:17,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Go down.

2279
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:20,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Go down under the waterfall.

2280
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:21,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Go down.

2281
01:47:22,424 --> 01:47:22,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Here he goes.

2282
01:47:22,845 --> 01:47:24,046
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going down, folks.

2283
01:47:24,366 --> 01:47:25,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, I missed it.

2284
01:47:26,329 --> 01:47:26,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

2285
01:47:26,889 --> 01:47:27,670
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got more stuff here.

2286
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:28,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, get the pink one.

2287
01:47:31,484 --> 01:47:35,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob goes for 10 seconds, and he has increased his time.

2288
01:47:37,427 --> 01:47:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So far his score is a whopping... He has 2,150 points.

2289
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, we can't read.

2290
01:47:44,751 --> 01:47:47,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And now he's out of the cave, and he's going into the tent.

2291
01:47:49,133 --> 01:47:50,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm flying!

2292
01:47:51,454 --> 01:47:52,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm flying!

2293
01:47:53,015 --> 01:47:54,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he comes out of the tent.

2294
01:47:56,016 --> 01:47:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I was locked.

2295
01:47:58,259 --> 01:47:59,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wobbed.

2296
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:01,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't say that's another inside joke.

2297
01:48:01,522 --> 01:48:02,162
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

2298
01:48:02,803 --> 01:48:03,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hit that shit.

2299
01:48:04,264 --> 01:48:04,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Go faster.

2300
01:48:05,385 --> 01:48:06,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it.

2301
01:48:06,325 --> 01:48:06,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 500.

2302
01:48:06,506 --> 01:48:06,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 500.

2303
01:48:07,026 --> 01:48:07,226
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's 200.

2304
01:48:07,646 --> 01:48:08,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't read.

2305
01:48:08,547 --> 01:48:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's another one.

2306
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:10,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got it.

2307
01:48:11,129 --> 01:48:12,050
[SPEAKER_05]: You got four more balloons.

2308
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Rob's going to crash.

2309
01:48:13,871 --> 01:48:15,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a wall.

2310
01:48:16,673 --> 01:48:17,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.

2311
01:48:17,854 --> 01:48:19,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this game is brought to you by Doom On.

2312
01:48:20,216 --> 01:48:21,797
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is brought to you by, oh, shit.

2313
01:48:22,297 --> 01:48:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Namco.

2314
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:25,059
[SPEAKER_05]: A fan, what's his name?

2315
01:48:25,099 --> 01:48:27,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, Namco owns your soul.

2316
01:48:27,671 --> 01:48:28,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I died.

2317
01:48:28,812 --> 01:48:30,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So what do you think of Prop Cycle?

2318
01:48:30,213 --> 01:48:35,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually pretty... Oh, dude, it shows... I had no sense of direction.

2319
01:48:35,617 --> 01:48:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop four balloons.

2320
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:40,100
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rob got wing leader for his first time.

2321
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:40,960
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not bad.

2322
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like third place.

2323
01:48:41,661 --> 01:48:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of fun.

2324
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:44,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been better if the game actually had sound.

2325
01:48:45,103 --> 01:48:47,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, that was like the worst radio ever.

2326
01:48:49,355 --> 01:48:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh, Matt's going to play.

2327
01:48:50,696 --> 01:48:51,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, don't you have to pee?

2328
01:48:51,857 --> 01:48:52,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, wait, wait.

2329
01:48:53,298 --> 01:48:57,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Missile Command, Centipede, Millipede.

2330
01:48:57,661 --> 01:49:00,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, what is Centipede and Millipede famous for?

2331
01:49:00,403 --> 01:49:01,223
[SPEAKER_13]: The one sound.

2332
01:49:03,685 --> 01:49:04,946
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your one-up noise.

2333
01:49:05,166 --> 01:49:06,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

2334
01:49:07,408 --> 01:49:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the difference between Centipede and Millipede?

2335
01:49:09,769 --> 01:49:10,370
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.

2336
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:14,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's the difference between Centipede and Millipede?

2337
01:49:15,533 --> 01:49:17,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Millipede is faster and harder and it's longer.

2338
01:49:18,448 --> 01:49:19,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Shaft?

2339
01:49:19,089 --> 01:49:21,611
[SPEAKER_13]: It's faster, harder, and longer, just like Shaft.

2340
01:49:24,133 --> 01:49:24,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2341
01:49:24,654 --> 01:49:27,076
[SPEAKER_13]: As Matt goes for, ooh, the hard level.

2342
01:49:27,096 --> 01:49:28,097
[SPEAKER_05]: The Solitaire.

2343
01:49:29,178 --> 01:49:30,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude, that dude has wings.

2344
01:49:33,341 --> 01:49:37,085
[SPEAKER_13]: And he is going for it with a vengeance.

2345
01:49:37,105 --> 01:49:37,085
100.

2346
01:49:37,185 --> 01:49:39,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And another 100.

2347
01:49:39,467 --> 01:49:40,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, a choo-choo train.

2348
01:49:40,568 --> 01:49:41,148
[SPEAKER_13]: And a train.

2349
01:49:41,368 --> 01:49:43,710
[SPEAKER_05]: A choo-choo.

2350
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,352
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember this level being really hard.

2351
01:49:46,317 --> 01:49:46,837
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

2352
01:49:46,957 --> 01:49:48,798
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a... He has to dive through the hole.

2353
01:49:50,198 --> 01:49:52,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And he got it, the one that was in the hole.

2354
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And now he's heading into the cave.

2355
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, go down the hole.

2356
01:49:57,401 --> 01:50:01,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to flush the potty.

2357
01:50:01,683 --> 01:50:03,163
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens when he gets a thousand right there?

2358
01:50:04,964 --> 01:50:06,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And now he is in the subway.

2359
01:50:06,885 --> 01:50:09,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting hit by... Running into poles.

2360
01:50:09,886 --> 01:50:11,226
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is full of poles and holes.

2361
01:50:12,127 --> 01:50:13,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Poles and holes.

2362
01:50:16,095 --> 01:50:22,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's got another 10 seconds, but he's only got 31 left.

2363
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:23,938
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the thousand mean?

2364
01:50:24,579 --> 01:50:25,159
[SPEAKER_13]: What thousand?

2365
01:50:25,499 --> 01:50:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: The thousand below his score.

2366
01:50:30,341 --> 01:50:30,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely.

2367
01:50:33,763 --> 01:50:35,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, he's kind of good at this game.

2368
01:50:35,243 --> 01:50:35,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And 18.

2369
01:50:38,184 --> 01:50:39,345
[SPEAKER_13]: He advanced one day.

2370
01:50:39,705 --> 01:50:40,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Day one.

2371
01:50:41,086 --> 01:50:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Day?

2372
01:50:41,826 --> 01:50:43,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he's been flying for a whole day, folks.

2373
01:50:45,069 --> 01:50:48,692
[SPEAKER_13]: and he's chasing another balloon around a girder and he decided not to go at it.

2374
01:50:49,032 --> 01:50:50,293
[SPEAKER_13]: He's going into another hole.

2375
01:50:50,313 --> 01:50:51,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just me.

2376
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:53,955
[SPEAKER_13]: It's me, Mario.

2377
01:50:54,155 --> 01:50:55,316
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not Mario.

2378
01:50:55,416 --> 01:50:56,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Mario.

2379
01:50:56,737 --> 01:50:57,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Wario.

2380
01:50:57,658 --> 01:50:58,418
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I told you.

2381
01:50:58,438 --> 01:50:58,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.

2382
01:50:58,939 --> 01:50:59,799
[SPEAKER_05]: They're playing the punching game.

2383
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:00,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that chick would kick my ass.

2384
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:03,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's got another ten seconds and ran into a wall.

2385
01:51:03,022 --> 01:51:03,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a wall, dude.

2386
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:05,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a person.

2387
01:51:05,183 --> 01:51:06,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to hear about your ass.

2388
01:51:06,784 --> 01:51:09,926
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently you cannot knock down the people that are in the cave.

2389
01:51:10,847 --> 01:51:11,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

2390
01:51:12,677 --> 01:51:13,237
[SPEAKER_05]: That's scary.

2391
01:51:13,357 --> 01:51:14,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And time is up.

2392
01:51:14,178 --> 01:51:15,739
[SPEAKER_13]: So how well did Loki do?

2393
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Two points for one play on this game?

2394
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's right.

2395
01:51:19,341 --> 01:51:20,161
[SPEAKER_13]: He got 1,400 points.

2396
01:51:20,201 --> 01:51:21,021
[SPEAKER_13]: He completed the level.

2397
01:51:23,683 --> 01:51:24,743
[SPEAKER_13]: And he gets an ending.

2398
01:51:26,124 --> 01:51:27,725
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude, that's Coffee Man Joe.

2399
01:51:27,745 --> 01:51:29,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's Ryo from... I made it.

2400
01:51:29,786 --> 01:51:31,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, the guy in Prop Cycle looks like Ryo from Digimon.

2401
01:51:32,327 --> 01:51:32,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

2402
01:51:33,948 --> 01:51:35,209
[SPEAKER_13]: He's now going to day two.

2403
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:40,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't get enough points.

2404
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:43,682
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually he did the first thing where you only play once.

2405
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:48,584
[SPEAKER_05]: These people are scaring me.

2406
01:51:49,865 --> 01:51:52,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see exactly how this goddamn punching bag game... Oh, there it is.

2407
01:51:54,026 --> 01:51:55,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It pops down.

2408
01:51:55,507 --> 01:51:56,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So are we ready to close the show?

2409
01:51:57,408 --> 01:51:58,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, where's the clock?

2410
01:51:59,809 --> 01:52:03,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we have like another minute and a half to fill?

2411
01:52:04,371 --> 01:52:05,912
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last segment five minutes early.

2412
01:52:07,156 --> 01:52:07,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

2413
01:52:08,277 --> 01:52:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to go play DDR.

2414
01:52:09,158 --> 01:52:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such awful radio.

2415
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:12,280
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do that's exciting for listeners?

2416
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:13,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Strip!

2417
01:52:13,921 --> 01:52:14,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say that.

2418
01:52:14,662 --> 01:52:16,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's start streaking through Scandia.

2419
01:52:16,924 --> 01:52:18,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we're sure not to have Tourney here.

2420
01:52:20,106 --> 01:52:21,827
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because they don't know that I'm from here.

2421
01:52:23,008 --> 01:52:23,588
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know me.

2422
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:26,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a tour around the rest of the arcade, shall we?

2423
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go play Bubble Bobble.

2424
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:28,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's Bubble Bobble?

2425
01:52:29,269 --> 01:52:31,311
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I heard Bubble Bobble.

2426
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:36,456
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just Ultracade has the Bubble Bobble sounds in it, but it doesn't have Bubble Bobble loaded yet.

2427
01:52:36,536 --> 01:52:37,496
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to have it in there.

2428
01:52:40,599 --> 01:52:42,020
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing the punching bag game.

2429
01:52:43,242 --> 01:52:44,643
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not Punch Mania, by the way.

2430
01:52:50,448 --> 01:52:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2431
01:52:51,609 --> 01:52:53,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what a weakling I am.

2432
01:52:53,471 --> 01:52:54,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get more tokens, okay?

2433
01:52:56,124 --> 01:52:59,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go ahead and do the... You know, there's two Centipede machines here.

2434
01:53:00,468 --> 01:53:01,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's walk around and poke at stuff.

2435
01:53:01,809 --> 01:53:02,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2436
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:06,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, everyone heard Afterburner, which I played because I'm cool.

2437
01:53:07,034 --> 01:53:08,075
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Centipede.

2438
01:53:08,095 --> 01:53:10,817
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one of the best shooter games ever, Raiden Fighter.

2439
01:53:11,378 --> 01:53:13,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude, you can buy this shit for a thousand bucks.

2440
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:14,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, a thousand for Centipede.

2441
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:15,802
[SPEAKER_13]: I can play it on my Atari 5200 at home.

2442
01:53:15,882 --> 01:53:17,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we got a Harley game.

2443
01:53:20,415 --> 01:53:22,296
[SPEAKER_13]: The old, old Harley game that's been out.

2444
01:53:22,316 --> 01:53:22,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's old?

2445
01:53:22,776 --> 01:53:23,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's pretty old.

2446
01:53:23,876 --> 01:53:24,336
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple years.

2447
01:53:24,676 --> 01:53:30,598
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Tekken Tag Tournament, which I've been hearing should be upgraded to a Tekken 4, but I don't know if it's going to be by 2029.

2448
01:53:30,638 --> 01:53:33,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Marvel vs. Capcom 2, a very, very fun game.

2449
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:35,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Revolution X, one of the most fun gun games ever.

2450
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:42,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Alien vs. Predator, Daytona USA, on cue.

2451
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:43,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Daytona!

2452
01:53:44,341 --> 01:53:47,122
[SPEAKER_13]: We have House of the Dead 2, which you can play on Dreamcast.

2453
01:53:47,162 --> 01:53:48,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, typing of the dead is fun.

2454
01:53:49,418 --> 01:53:50,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've heard of that game.

2455
01:53:50,459 --> 01:53:52,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Got Left Dark Legacy.

2456
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,762
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Golden Tee 4.

2457
01:53:55,922 --> 01:53:56,203
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's 4.

2458
01:53:57,343 --> 01:53:58,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Not 4 with a hyphen.

2459
01:53:58,484 --> 01:54:03,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Which reminds me, the very first place I ever played Golden Tee was a little ghetto cade in Roseville called Supercade.

2460
01:54:03,768 --> 01:54:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Supercade closed this month.

2461
01:54:05,929 --> 01:54:06,429
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy retired.

2462
01:54:06,449 --> 01:54:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a moment of silence.

2463
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:08,491
[SPEAKER_04]: A moment of silence for Supercade.

2464
01:54:09,571 --> 01:54:11,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Supercade ruled because they have Playboy Pinball.

2465
01:54:11,793 --> 01:54:12,413
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I had to say.

2466
01:54:12,493 --> 01:54:13,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I want to show off.

2467
01:54:13,874 --> 01:54:14,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what a weakling I am.

2468
01:54:17,156 --> 01:54:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, everybody.

2469
01:54:19,455 --> 01:54:23,756
[SPEAKER_13]: and someone is playing Rockman Power Battles.

2470
01:54:24,716 --> 01:54:27,617
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he's playing Rockman.

2471
01:54:28,537 --> 01:54:29,878
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually that's Proto Man right there.

2472
01:54:29,958 --> 01:54:31,738
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but the game came out as Rockman.

2473
01:54:31,818 --> 01:54:33,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, now Rob's going to punch the thingy.

2474
01:54:33,398 --> 01:54:34,399
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to punch this thing.

2475
01:54:34,419 --> 01:54:35,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's listen to this.

2476
01:54:35,139 --> 01:54:38,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what has he become?

2477
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:41,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob on the meter is, he hit 290.

2478
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:43,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he gets to hit it again. 290.

2479
01:54:49,656 --> 01:54:50,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Rob gets one more try.

2480
01:54:50,417 --> 01:54:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's good.

2481
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:52,338
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2482
01:54:52,739 --> 01:54:53,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you didn't even get a rating.

2483
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't register.

2484
01:54:55,081 --> 01:54:56,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob did not register.

2485
01:54:56,762 --> 01:54:57,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try.

2486
01:54:57,863 --> 01:54:58,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, hold on.

2487
01:54:58,864 --> 01:55:00,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob's going to give me money to play.

2488
01:55:01,086 --> 01:55:01,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Who holds what?

2489
01:55:01,887 --> 01:55:03,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to probably get really bad.

2490
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:08,573
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do better than Rob, you get to autograph something for yourself.

2491
01:55:09,293 --> 01:55:10,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here's the microphone.

2492
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:11,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

2493
01:55:11,815 --> 01:55:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's going to show off what a stud she is.

2494
01:55:15,211 --> 01:55:15,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Here she goes.

2495
01:55:16,712 --> 01:55:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: She's revving up.

2496
01:55:17,832 --> 01:55:19,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cracking her knuckles.

2497
01:55:23,194 --> 01:55:23,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Here she goes.

2498
01:55:26,856 --> 01:55:27,596
[SPEAKER_04]: She also got 290.

2499
01:55:27,856 --> 01:55:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think 290 is what you get when you hit it so weak it didn't even register.

2500
01:55:32,278 --> 01:55:32,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Try again.

2501
01:55:32,838 --> 01:55:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Try again, Jamie.

2502
01:55:34,259 --> 01:55:34,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let that scurry off.

2503
01:55:35,299 --> 01:55:38,200
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times did you put... I put one.

2504
01:55:38,841 --> 01:55:39,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I try one more?

2505
01:55:40,268 --> 01:55:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

2506
01:55:40,989 --> 01:55:41,990
[SPEAKER_05]: How come nobody's registering?

2507
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:43,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean... I'm going to try one more.

2508
01:55:43,431 --> 01:55:43,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do it.

2509
01:55:44,131 --> 01:55:45,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do my Popeye hit, okay?

2510
01:55:46,914 --> 01:55:47,835
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go, here we go.

2511
01:55:47,995 --> 01:55:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Flying jump kick.

2512
01:55:48,695 --> 01:55:49,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go, Jim.

2513
01:55:49,656 --> 01:55:50,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to kick it.

2514
01:55:51,398 --> 01:55:52,118
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm too short.

2515
01:55:52,419 --> 01:55:52,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

2516
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I could even kick that high.

2517
01:55:54,901 --> 01:55:56,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I could, like, axe kick it or something.

2518
01:55:57,523 --> 01:55:58,364
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, here we go.

2519
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I stepped on your foot.

2520
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:01,847
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

2521
01:56:01,867 --> 01:56:03,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't feel anything.

2522
01:56:04,864 --> 01:56:05,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're a playboy.

2523
01:56:05,904 --> 01:56:07,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob went over the scale.

2524
01:56:07,225 --> 01:56:08,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob is now a playboy.

2525
01:56:09,086 --> 01:56:11,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I bet you these two are like the lights are out.

2526
01:56:12,307 --> 01:56:13,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You only get one punch.

2527
01:56:13,547 --> 01:56:14,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to play again.

2528
01:56:14,748 --> 01:56:15,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a playboy.

2529
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to play again.

2530
01:56:17,149 --> 01:56:17,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I got one more.

2531
01:56:17,949 --> 01:56:18,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2532
01:56:18,489 --> 01:56:19,210
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to headbutt it.

2533
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:21,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really?

2534
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:22,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to hurt.

2535
01:56:22,491 --> 01:56:23,531
[SPEAKER_13]: No, my head's too hard.

2536
01:56:25,852 --> 01:56:29,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm digging deep into my pocket.

2537
01:56:29,033 --> 01:56:30,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob's digging deep into his pants.

2538
01:56:32,675 --> 01:56:33,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Go, Jamie, go.

2539
01:56:34,934 --> 01:56:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: This may make her forget how much deep... Here we go.

2540
01:56:39,197 --> 01:56:40,258
[SPEAKER_04]: She can't reach to kick it.

2541
01:56:40,398 --> 01:56:43,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I can actually reach the ball to kick it, but not high enough to actually kick it up into the thing.

2542
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:44,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

2543
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, girl.

2544
01:56:45,581 --> 01:56:45,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

2545
01:56:46,762 --> 01:56:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Here she goes.

2546
01:56:48,283 --> 01:56:50,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Pow.

2547
01:56:51,364 --> 01:56:52,005
[SPEAKER_04]: She got 210.

2548
01:56:52,525 --> 01:56:52,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Try again.

2549
01:56:52,905 --> 01:56:53,666
[SPEAKER_04]: See if it'll let you do it again.

2550
01:56:55,907 --> 01:56:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2551
01:56:58,409 --> 01:56:58,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on it.

2552
01:56:59,149 --> 01:57:01,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's a weakling, but that's okay.

2553
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:01,831
[SPEAKER_04]: We love her anyway.

2554
01:57:05,234 --> 01:57:07,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And now to relieve myself, I'm going to go sulk.

2555
01:57:09,637 --> 01:57:12,118
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually about ready to wrap up this train wreck of a show.

2556
01:57:12,678 --> 01:57:13,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Here comes Matt, though.

2557
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:18,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Matt is also a Playboy, but I would like to point out I believe I was a little stronger.

2558
01:57:18,382 --> 01:57:19,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he get Superman?

2559
01:57:19,563 --> 01:57:21,083
[SPEAKER_04]: A Playboy Superman.

2560
01:57:21,183 --> 01:57:22,524
[SPEAKER_04]: He got Playboy and Superman?

2561
01:57:22,604 --> 01:57:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: He went over the scale.

2562
01:57:24,005 --> 01:57:26,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, what I think is lots of the lights are out, but they all light up.

2563
01:57:26,807 --> 01:57:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think this machine is just fucked up.

2564
01:57:30,549 --> 01:57:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, Roseville, anyone?

2565
01:57:32,978 --> 01:57:34,379
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to tell Keith to fix his machine.

2566
01:57:34,819 --> 01:57:36,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2567
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to end the show.

2568
01:57:39,521 --> 01:57:40,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts, Jamie?

2569
01:57:41,862 --> 01:57:45,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have anything to drink to burp, so, uh... This is kind of fun.

2570
01:57:46,905 --> 01:57:47,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, bite me.

2571
01:57:48,285 --> 01:57:48,725
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

2572
01:57:49,566 --> 01:57:50,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts from Derek?

2573
01:57:51,467 --> 01:57:52,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I already have a microphone.

2574
01:57:53,388 --> 01:57:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts, though?

2575
01:57:55,909 --> 01:57:57,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... Give me that.

2576
01:57:58,450 --> 01:57:59,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts from Matt?

2577
01:58:00,551 --> 01:58:00,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2578
01:58:01,294 --> 01:58:05,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That chick in that police 911 too had huge tits.

2579
01:58:06,039 --> 01:58:08,441
[SPEAKER_02]: How can she fight crime and have huge tits at the same time?

2580
01:58:08,501 --> 01:58:09,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not right.

2581
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:09,902
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wonderbra.

2582
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:12,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts from the love slave?

2583
01:58:14,907 --> 01:58:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hungry.

2584
01:58:16,349 --> 01:58:16,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

2585
01:58:18,651 --> 01:58:19,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You might just get fed.

2586
01:58:20,993 --> 01:58:22,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go get manga chow.

2587
01:58:22,134 --> 01:58:22,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're still open.

2588
01:58:22,815 --> 01:58:23,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, police brutality.

2589
01:58:24,847 --> 01:58:25,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We're ending this show now.

2590
01:58:25,828 --> 01:58:26,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everybody for listening.

2591
01:58:26,909 --> 01:58:30,612
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought, the listeners are never going to let us take a week off again.

2592
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:32,213
[SPEAKER_13]: But we love you anyway.

2593
01:58:32,393 --> 01:58:34,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening to our pre-taped madness.

2594
01:58:34,755 --> 01:58:37,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it say puff puff and his hand's in his pocket?

2595
01:58:38,939 --> 01:58:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you guys next week.

2596
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,081
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be live.

2597
01:58:41,241 --> 01:58:46,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And our fortune cookie message of the week is, are you in joy?

2598
01:58:48,267 --> 01:58:48,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

2599
01:58:48,867 --> 01:58:49,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2600
01:58:49,968 --> 01:58:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you guys next week.

2601
01:58:51,565 --> 01:58:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week when we'll be live and you can yell at us in the chat room and tell us we suck.

2602
01:58:55,989 --> 01:58:58,331
[SPEAKER_05]: This time I won't be there so you don't have to worry about me.

2603
01:58:59,032 --> 01:59:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because Derek's in deep trouble.

2604
01:59:01,854 --> 01:59:05,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, he's not in just deep trouble, he's in... Boiling diarrhea.

2605
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:07,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Not boiling diarrhea anymore.

2606
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,922
[SPEAKER_13]: You are now stuck somewhere in constipation land.

2607
01:59:10,763 --> 01:59:13,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2608
01:59:33,826 --> 01:59:38,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
