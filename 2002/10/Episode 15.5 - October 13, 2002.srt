The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:08,600
The galaxy is at peace.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,800
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Ms. Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Lauren, Lorna, he's good.

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
How can you tell?

13

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Thirty-seven. My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks.

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
In a row?

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
You are the weakest link to bite.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
So you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

Dark Sakura

I hate nature!

23
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
I wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Sky

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,300

No, Satan!

125
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
No!

126
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,780
This is going to be one of those shows where you have to fight with a loud speaker the whole time.

127
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,780
It is an experimental show, ladies and gentlemen. Let me remind you.

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,780
And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

129
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Yes, I like Grease.

130
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,780
I hate that damn movie. I've seen it 50 million times and I know all the damn songs.

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Grease is classic. Get it on DVD now.

132
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,780
No, it's Satan. Grease is Satan.

133
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,780
Why is Grease Satan? What's wrong with you?

134
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,300
you because my sister watched it like five times a day for like three weeks

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,580
straight Greece came out like you know okay when I was eight years old I watched

136
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,380
the movie clue every day for an entire class I like that movie now now you're

137
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,300
back on my good side you better stay there that's like no three that's three

138
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,580
I think they're making actually a Greece three they better not yes they are and

139
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,300
And by the way, Clue had Tim Curry.

140
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,060
And what else was Tim Curry in?

141
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060

142
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060

143
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Whee!

144
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,980
Why would they make a great Grease 3?

145
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,100
Grease 3 is starring the Olivia Project.

146
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,220
No, no, they would think you had a car in the first, the cars in the first one.

147
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,660
You had microphones in the second, uh, microphones, motorcycles in the second one.

148
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
What are you going to have next?

149
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
A moped?

150
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
It's a high score reunion.

151
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,540
Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

152
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,440
It's bringing back the original cast, too.

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,420
would be cool so it's like instead of Romeo Michelle it's John and Olivia's

speaking of extreme

188

because we're getting we're getting people to interview but

190

let's talk about

191
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,440
what is so extreme about this week's show

192
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
well first i don't know what the fuck was that

193
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,640
right now what was that that's corny as hell

194
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,180

197
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,900
before the show

198
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,900
world record champion on conjoined twin galaxies except

199
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,800
we didn't have a video camera to tape it so don't count

200
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,500
when we do get a camera

201
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,720
he will accept except black lab has sworn to me

202
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,860
he will destroy the world record no matter where it's at he will trade long

203
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,360
and hard he's gonna be like sylvester stallone

204
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,280
in rocky

205
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,160
it is going to beat that record has put it this way it was the record was so sad

206
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,360
that actually me who can't perfect attack or shit

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,680
beat the record by a like a good forty or fifty million points it's for a cold

208
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,440
out here

209
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
lol

210
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,760
i mean i could have played the last song dynamite rating freestyle and still

211
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,360
would have beat that stupid record

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,780
they're raving he can't played out

213
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,140
i can go back and edited in the show's later

214
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,820
the person we want to interview left that sucks

215
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,400
what i care is you're still in their just gonna come on to interview that guy

216
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,100
over there is a gazebo empty

217
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,140
gazebo gazebo we go

218
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,460
we're gonna what we can do anything we want

219
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,620
well they're going to give you know we're walking over to the usual

220
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
No, you can't from the pond that you can be there.

221
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,620
We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and like do golf claps and shit.

222
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
I'm sorry, the listeners couldn't hear you.

223
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,620
We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and like clap for them and stuff, even though they suck.

224
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,620
Ah, now this is a great table. This is a big table.

225
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
And it's windshielded.

226
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
Windshield and a...

227
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
Dude, this is like the carpet that they put on the walls at roller rinks.

228
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Now you guys on that side are going to have to like raise your hand if you want to talk.

229
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
I'm going to hand you a microphone.

230
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
No, you can't yell.

231
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Whee!

232
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Slidey song.

233
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,620
I finally passed that.

234
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
So, let's talk about DDR Extreme.

235
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Yay!

236
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
DDR Sextreme!

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Derek, let's change, if we can.

238
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,620
I don't change for anyone.

239
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
You can sit on that side of the table, I'll sit on this side.

240
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
This is really great radio, by the way.

241
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Alright, here we go.

242
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,620
table-to-table

243
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,940
i always saw a low-key is kind of our news desk of the show so i'll let him

244
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,340
talk about the art stream even though he's not prepared to but i'm sure i'll

245
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,520
have something nice to say by the way

246
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,740
low-key now doing news for team while oh congratulations

247
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,400
actually have a comment about that this is kind of an f you to myself

248
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,280
i was viciously pointed out uh... by

249
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,760
DJ Paranoid to have copied his list and put it on Team Gwyla, which is a big, big, big,

250
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:58,760
big, big, big note of if you don't give credit. No, that's plagiarism. And, ooh, oh. And anyways,

251
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,000
in the, to begin with, okay, first off, I copied Black Lab's list at the begin with,

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
okay. And that list-

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
See, Black Lab's from Black Lab.

254
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah, it doesn't matter about him. So I took his list at first. It didn't have any frickin'

255
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,960
names on it, none of the artist's names, so that kind of sucked. So I borrowed his list,

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,200
I forgot to put, I mean, shit man, I'm putting this list up like way early in the morning,

257
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,080
I'm so damn tired. I do that, and then finally it doesn't hit me until he's like,

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,680
ass, thanks for stealing my list. So I've been hearing about it for like the last three days,

259
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,640
you know, gave big credit to him and their, you know, Bhavani style for translating

260
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,960
Naoki's urinal to make it actually legible. The big question is, did you guys kiss the makeup?

261
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:57,960
No, but I kissed ass, I sent him emails, PMs, I even apologized to Spigamous in the DDR Maniacs chat room, so hopefully some way he got the message, you know, that I am gratefully sorry and be happy to make it up to him, you know, maybe shared resources for some story or whatnot, you know.

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Put out.

263
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
No.

264
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,960
No, no, there will be no putting out, okay? I'm sorry, that's not happening.

265
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,600
happening but i think i've gone you know above and beyond to apologize for simple

266
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,400
mistake i mean that got fixed within a couple hours gone down and look yes and

267
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,000
look if he gives you hell for it just use the nistia global gate translator

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,080
because it does it nearly perfectly anyway

269
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,920
well it wasn't that it was just like i used his list that had the names on it

270
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
whoop-dee-doo i mean you know i could have just done

271
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
the list myself you know next no i'm not plagiarizing anymore but if i

272
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,960
there were, I certainly would reformat the shit so it wouldn't look anything like anyone

273
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
else's.

274
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
And you just played Joel Ives' Black Lab, because that's okay.

275
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
That doesn't matter, he's in our...

276
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,160
He's probably in the chatroom right now.

277
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
He's nobody important.

278
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
In the future.

279
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,240
Sorry, Black Lab, I didn't mean that.

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,880
No, but anyways, yeah, so I'm doing news now, it kind of sucks because then I have to be

281
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
on top of all the news stories instead of browsing the internet and, you know, chatting

282
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
in chatrooms.

283
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,800
You're on top, going down, bending over backwards, good lord, you're an acrobat.

284
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Down, down, down.

285
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Yeah, so...

286
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Hey, but, but, one of the things I did, I was able to have that, you know, one else did have

287
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,800
is I actually got those clips from the DDR Max USA, all the new samples are supposedly gonna be in there

288
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
because everyone gave me shit about that too, saying,

289
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Oh, how do you know that shit's gonna be in there?

290
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
It's not confirmed? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

291
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Like, I really give a shit. I'm just ripping samples for people to hear.

292
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I have a comment on that. If they're not going to be in the game, why do they exist?

293
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Now the old stuff, I understand. Konami? Lazy? Certainly.

294
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,800
They leave the old stuff from Max Japan in there, like ghosts and things like that, and they sneak in there.

295
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
You know, but these new remixes weren't just done for the hell of it.

296
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Well, I don't know, maybe Naoki gets bored one night and he's doing his nails like,

297
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Hmm, maybe I'll remix, uh...

298
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Dear Diary, I ran out of black figure-down polish,

299
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I decided to remix a new song with my best buddy, who will be unnamed.

300
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Why would they be in there if they're not going to be in the final game?

301
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Does it just specifically throw us off?

302
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Well, even if it is just there to throw us off,

303
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
hey, it's a Nubomani remix clip, that's newsworthy.

304
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Well then, the fact that, like, Kakumei was in there, okay, the clip for Kakumei,

305
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
and they're like, some guy's like,

306
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
no, that got cut, and so did ghosts.

307
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I know for sure.

308
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Because I'm actually developing the game, so I know.

309
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,640
would you like to know what your source

310
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,200
i'm always a man if you guys got information search areas that call me

311
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
tell me i'm wrong you know

312
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,040
search and some info

313
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,060
that's right unless

314
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,260
unless you work for konami where you're sleeping with someone who works for

315
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,920
konami

316
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,740
we just can't believe you i'm sorry we're just gonna have to always told you

317
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,060
know the game comes out so

318
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,360
i'm sorry

319
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,220
i'll get right on sleeping with everybody

320
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,400
but the fact that

321
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,240
yeah i don't know would anybody at this table put out for information on that

322
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,440
you are sad and i think

323
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
right now

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,840
that all of my fiance

325
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,760
manages a game stop

326
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,240
i don't have to put out it was comes with the job but you know that he does

327
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,900
it does he get information that

328
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,360
yet about an army

329
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,880
sometimes like game releases we doesn't really get know the rally under the

330
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,400
storm had information that i can talk about that

331
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,160
i'd go down it

332
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,340
go down some chicken on me to get information

333
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,940
just as you begin some

334
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,620
no

335
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
not at all

336
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,340
here at the

337
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,740
america one day and that was the fact that he said it put out for information

338
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,700
about dvd are i think that i put out there

339
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,980

362
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,620

363
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,140
a ways that they had a

364
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,060
a little voting thing going on that we mentioned last week and i've seen some

365
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,040
of them

366
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,300
and someone who had to do it in florida there are no songs by extreme

367
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,780
they went out and i have

368
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,900
how about it

369
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,220
let me guess i'm just gonna throw out

370
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,600
an idea here

371
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,480
could the next max b

372
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,100
max extreme uh...

373
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,220
uh...

374
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,300
they don't know

375
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,020
it's the remix of max three hundred by erotic max extreme

376
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,780
old backs but but but but don't have sex

377

i'll be there would be fucking sweet and i don't know if that's correct

378
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,560
people to do that so i don't know

379
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
but anyway

380
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,080
uh... yes it's a very thought that they're mentioning there were no out

381
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,920
there

382
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,880
they're possibly going to be in there not confirmed to be in there but

383
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
possibly

384
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,860
uh... sees there with that the mania

385
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,520
uh... to the ex you've got to be in a

386
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,820
fuck you lucky by the way

387
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,920
which together is in the a

388
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,200
uh... for the veterans or something i don't know

389
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,640
anyways uh... let's see there is a very perfect is the least one hundred

390
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,900
seconds and

391
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,420
and something else

392
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,980
that's not fire or jet world because i really will

393
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,600
narrow i wanted to know about it and sweet

394
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
uh...

395
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,460
there is a hold on me from uh...

396
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,360
with a pair of hair which everyone's just like this is crap

397
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,200
which i agree i rather had i mean

398
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
even like a number of rock

399
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,420
thinking about king of iraq would be awesome

400
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,080
king of iraq you're even like a burning desire

401
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,960
deluxe pocket deluxe india are not rule

402
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,880
maybe not

403
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,440
uh... in the in the microphone

404
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,960
that's like the only be if they know i look so gay doing it

405
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
do we have a lot

406
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,300
okay well first

407
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,680
first up just because these you know became a nice these were on you know

408
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
top of the list here

409
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,800
doesn't mean that they're not going to throw this stuff in there so i mean

410
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,140
It's very possible. I would be happy if Cosmic Cowgirl was in Max.

411
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,760
So I wonder, I wonder how long this DDR Extreme is going to last. I mean, and what...

412
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,620
One week.

413
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,680
It's just because I think they changed interface designs. One week since this game came out.

414
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,600
One week since I looked at it.

415
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,720
The question is,

416
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,680
how often will it be bootlegged? Will it be a bigger or more rampant bootleg than

417
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,340
Mootleg?

418
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,680
Meant than Max 2 or? I was born for radio.

419
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,440
well we're having a discussion in the dee dee or i mean the extra room today

420
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,320
person that they

421
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,180
i'd all our friends in the d r maniacs chattel

422
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,060
and love ya

423
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,460
uh... sorry if you

424
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,600
i'm not

425
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,740
uh... we've

426
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,740
we've got lots of fans over there going

427
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,800
we have you

428
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,300
and your other body is always speaking to the one fan

429
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Talking to him today, and we were discussing the fact that DDR Extreme, since it is so extreme, should have a fog machine and lasers.

430
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Because who doesn't like a good laser?

431
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,300
As I said earlier on another chat board, I said it should be...

432
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
This is kind of a joke I used earlier, but I don't care, it's still funny.

433
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,300
DDR sex stream, with a big pole in the middle, and all erotic set of songs.

434
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Remember what I was saying the other night?

435
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
What?

436
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
That it needs the butt pads, you can have booty mode.

437
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,820
Yeah, they're good. They're gonna put a button on the bar. So you could like rub your ass against the bar

438
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,020
Well, who daddy and my baby mama? We need the grind. What were you saying JB?

439
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,300
Actually what they're gonna do is they're gonna have a nice little chair in front of the

440
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,060
The pads itself and sitting on the chair will be a mannequin

441
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,300
So you bump and grind against the mannequin to get some bonus points there

442
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,300
And it's going to be one of those real dolls of Maoki.

443
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
And it's got session mode with a boonga boonga.

444
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Ahhhhh!

445
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Actually, what's scary is he'll be probably sneaking himself into one of these DDR6 stream machines.

446
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Since, you know, no one will be able to tell the difference.

447
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Since the real dolls are supposed to be hard to tell from the real thing except they don't blink or move.

448
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Yeah, you know what's scary? So I heard on the news today that, uh, Michael Jackson abuses his monkey.

449
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Yeah, I heard that-

450
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
EEEEEE!

451
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
AHH!

452
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
I don't like when he messes with his monkey.

453
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Does his monkey fling poo?

454
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Maybe, you know, uh-

455
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I think Michael Jackson should be beating his monkey anywhere.

456
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,300
For those of you that heard Dance Maniacs 8, lovely, pathetic cover of, uh-

457
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,300
That was kind of, uh, contradictory, wasn't it? I don't know how else to describe it.

458
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
I'd like to see that in DDR, just for laughs.

459
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Just for laughs.

460
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
I'm still...

461
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Well, with DDR6 stream, that would definitely fit.

462
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Beat it!

463
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Beat it!

464
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I can just see...

465
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
No, here's the kit and have it.

466
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,300
You can either have Beat It by DJ Alligator Project or Erotic.

467
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Erotic.

468
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.

469
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,300
That's my watch.

470
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
It says, this will explode.

471
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
This watch has the time of day.

472
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,060
this watch has the time of your doom. It's my 007 watch. It's the doomsday clock.

473
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,340
They gave out to all the managers of GameStop. 11.59 and ticking.

474
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,480
I don't know. Right, honey? And the time

475
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,380
is 0.59. Time to die. Oh, no. Oh, what nerds are we?

476
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:07,060
So, what other cool things can we expect to see in DDR Extreme?

477
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,500
Oh, yes, JB? In the DDR Extreme.

478
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
What about Gillette?

479
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Don't want no short dick, man.

480
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
You remember that song?

481
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Maybe I'm going to play that during one of the breaks.

482
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
If I remember when I'm putting this show together,

483
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
when I get back home and editing it,

484
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
I'll put Gillette as one of the songs we'll play.

485
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
What about what?

486
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Tonight's a good song. I'll try to play that for you if I remember.

487
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
There's the one song that I definitely want played.

488
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
What's that?

489
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Children of the Sandstorm.

490
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Now explain this mix.

491
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,800
I was going, I was looking for a sandstorm because I actually did not have it on my computer.

492
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You just couldn't get enough of last week's joke.

493
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
It was Sunday night after I got home.

494
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,800
And I found, um, for people who are familiar with it, um, Robert Miles did a song called Children.

495
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
And I found that mixed with sandstorm.

496
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
That was actually pretty nice.

497
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,800
That was a huge song when I was in high school. It makes me feel so old.

498
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
It was a good mix.

499
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I mean, it was basically cut and paste type, but it was done very smoothly.

500
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Oh, JB left you a present, by the way.

501
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Yeah, I left you a present.

502
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh, JB, explain the present that you left for Jamie.

503
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Okay, it was Dynamite R5.

504
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
And explain, tell us a little bit about Dynamite R5.

505
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Um, it's Dynamite Rave and R5 mixed together.

506
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Excellent, very good, yes!

507
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I must listen to this right away.

508
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Yes, Golf Land, we are in the gazebo overlooking the lovely course here.

509
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I see, this is beautiful, we've got a castle right in front of us.

510
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
And we're not at Golf Land, wow.

511
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Thank God.

512
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Assholes.

513
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
And their stuff's messed up.

514
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Hey, Initial D took my money, but I'm addicted to that game.

515
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay, fuck the money for a second, I want to talk about Initial D.

516
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Oh wait, look, you have something to say?

517
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Um...

518
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Yeah, I'm guessing we'll hear it.

519
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Supposedly what's going to be happening week to week with Naoki.

520
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I love that song.

521
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Oh, that's right, another song was announced for DVR Extreme.

522
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,360
Um, this is gonna be a new Ryu whatever her damn name is Kosaka or I blow now. Yeah, I blow Naoki Rui Rui blow

523
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,800
Naoki

524
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
She's doing a song that's called

525
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,300
Shit, I don't know whatever it's some stupid shit, whatever it's gonna be like candy, but it's supposed to be heavy metal or rock

526
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
or some crap like that.

527
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Weh weh weh.

528
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Weh weh weh.

529
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Weh.

530
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Weh.

531
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Weh.

532
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Anyways, just keep going.

533
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I'm going to run in and see if anyone else shows up.

534
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
So, yeah.

535
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Naoki's Journal sucks.

536
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
They're supposed to be doing some interviews or questionnaires with the staff.

537
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
They're like, we give a shit.

538
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Let's see what the staff thinks about DDR Extreme.

539
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
They're probably all going to say, uh, Naoki's gay.

540
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
DDR.

541
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
So, um, let's see here.

542
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,300
And meanwhile over here, you're hearing voices.

543
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Yes! I keep hearing somebody saying my name, and it's not JB!

544
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,300
No, they're going, Big Fuck! Big Fuck!

545
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,300
It just sounds like it.

546
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Well, since we have this big gap of space here,

547
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm going to go ahead and do the sim update for this week.

548
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
And we actually have news this week, which is pretty cool.

549
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
And it's my turn to excuse myself. Take the mic.

550
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Okay.

551
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,300
So, here's what's going on in the sim world here.

552
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,500
First off, you have a new release of StepMania.

553
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:29,300
StepMania, actually, it's kind of been called, it's Beta 6 Release 2, or what they're calling it is Beta 7.

554
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:37,800
And, um, so Beta 7's out now. I've got it at home, I haven't gotten to try it out yet, but, you know, StepMania hasn't disappointed me yet.

555
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
My StepMania doesn't work on my computer.

556
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,300
You used to not like StepMania back in the early versions. You're a liar! You're a liar!

557
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Alright, okay, SetMania really did disappoint me back in the version 1.6, 1.6.5, that area,

558
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,300
because it didn't load, and it sucked, and it was really slow, and it was a piece of shit, and DWI kicked his ass.

559
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,300
However, since then, since they've gone actually doing, like, public updates, you know, where there's, like,

560
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,300
you know, 30 people working on updating this thing instead of two, it's gotten a lot better.

561
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,180
better so you've got now you have pump support para para support you also have

562
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,620
easy to dancer support in there so that's kind of cool which means what

563
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:25,380
which means you can play those games on that simulator okay not everybody knows

564
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:33,260
that well she didn't know Derek's a little slow no I'm fat and I didn't eat

565
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,100
today anyways other than that let's see on a personal note I'm putting up

566
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,700
off DWIs on the internet. I've actually got my own site that's going to be started here

567
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,960
pretty soon.

568
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
LeechFromLoki.com.

569
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,360
Hey, you know what? That's not a bad name.

570
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Hyrule.

571
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,880
I'm going to call that Leech From Loki. It's awesome though because I found a site, it's

572
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,500
like gamers.com or some shit like that, or gamers club I believe is what it's called.

573
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,640
It's 50 megs of web space free and unlimited bandwidth.

574
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I love it.

575
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
bandwidth. Shit, I could put stuff on there. Don't want to worry about my site going down.

576
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,720
It's awesome.

577
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,180
That's super orgasmic.

578
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,040
So I'm gonna have

579
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm gonna have my DWIs on there. Plus, really hard to find a rare, like, 8-style DWIs in my...

580
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,820
It's free, right?

581
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,960
Yeah, it's free.

582
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,960
So it's pretty cool. I'll be doing that. Maybe get a couple of sites if I run out of my 50 megs.

583
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,480
You run out of space?

584
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,100
That kind of stuff. So, um...

585
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,860
No, look for that pretty soon. I'll announce it later on.

586
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,480
Do they bog you down with banner ads or any of that crap?

587
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,520
Unfortunately, yes. They do.

588
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,080
playing is ever really free

589
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,480
mozilla dot com highly recommended by orange launch staff block ads

590
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,680
awesome love it

591
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,280
sounds good ball for the link to that on my site i'm sure they won't like it but

592
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,060
i'll probably get there so

593
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,280
now i have that and uh...

594
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,000

595
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,880
i'm not too much going on the same world more people releasing stuff of your mix

596
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
that he got the i think i'm not pretty good on that

597
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,580
d r u k they've actually got now the official backgrounds for his area two

598
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,860
thousand one in before you out before the beat mix which is

599
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,600
pretty cool looking uh...

600
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,240
and also to be adding the uh...

601
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,380
rest of the debate including

602
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,320
caribbean queen

603
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320

family

605
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,900
that

606
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,780
okay with itself

607
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,040
no more anything

608
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,480
but uh...

609
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,660
all right uh...

610
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,680
so we do an interview some guesses that are just a bit

611
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,720

704
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
You're just digging yourself deeper tonight.

705
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
It's a little grey cat.

706
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,900
She looks like Church from Pet Sematary.

707
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Oh, that's actually a good point.

708
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
You never saw Pet Sematary.

709
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I was afraid of it. It was a scary movie.

710
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
What?

711
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
That was a pretty child's play.

712
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
That movie freaked the shit out of me.

713
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
I don't like little daddy doll things.

714
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
I was scared of the Wizard of Oz.

715
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Wait a minute, you were scared of the Wizard of Oz?

716
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Why?

717
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
The little gnome things.

718
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
The monkeys that fly on the...

719
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
The Munch Kids that fly out of their ass?

720
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,900
No, it's the lollipop kids.

721
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
The Munch Kids.

722
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Did you ever see the great sequel Return to Oz?

723
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
With the thing on the wheels?

724
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
Dude, no.

725
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
You're thinking of the Wiz.

726
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,900
No, Return to Oz was good.

727
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,900
The reason why Return to Oz was good is because it was actually based off of the book.

728
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Yes, and Verusa Bach was in it and she's cool.

729
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,900
The Wizard of Oz was not true to the book, because she went and met all of the witches.

730
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,900
She met the Good Witch of the North, the Good Witch of the South, killed one of them, and then killed the other.

731
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,900
So there was no balance, and Oz fell into ruin.

732
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,900
I remember the freakiest scene in Return to Oz, with all the little heads in the jar.

733
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
That was so cool.

734
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
That was awesome.

735
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Oh, I'm sorry, but money what?

736
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,900
This is Random Night on Orange Lounge, you heard it here first.

737
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
You heard it here first.

738
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Oh, you know something we brought up earlier?

739
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
I want to talk about...

740
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Oh, ass!

741
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
No, not ass.

742
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,580
It's, uh, not Bomani-related exactly, but it's still pretty cool.

743
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Initial D.

744
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Rob is staring at me.

745
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580

752
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
No, fat with fat.

753
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:39,580
And Orange Beanie has my SNIS one that I messed up on.

memory card. I don't know.

For what system?

768
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,540
For a PS2. Not for a PS2, for a PlayStation.

769
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,460
You win a Dark Sakura autographed memory card.

770
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,860
Here's your first clue.

771
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,740
You get two clues. And they're pretty easy clues if you know how to find it.

772
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,500
The password is...

773
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,860
The first clue is that the word is Greek.

774
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,260
Second clue... Now, wait a minute. Didn't they ban video games in Greece?

775
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,300
Fuck Greece. By the way, they overruled that.

776
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,860
Oh. The second rule

777
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,580
is that it means goal.

778
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,180
Mmm.

779
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,940
Goal!

780
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,300
Like soccer? Yeah, like, you know, a goal.

781
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,660
Like, you know, because you've got to have goals.

783
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820

787
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,940

or you win or is that

789
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,660

791

1023
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,920

where it flips around

1067
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,220
and like at certain times you'll get the evil picture of the demon and there's

1068
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,320

00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,960

00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:29,040
Anyway, like I was saying, we're going to try to get things started as soon as possible

1103
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040

00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,640

1118
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,640
points if you dress up like the A-Team, and I'm not talking about the Korean one.

1119
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,640
No, we need Mr. T.

1120
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Hey, and remember, Mr. T supports Shaft,

1121
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,640
he pities the foo-hoo who don't go to Shaft. He's on the site with his orange afro.

1122
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,640
You know what, maybe you ought to ask an incentive, an extra

1123
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,640
tenth of a point to anyone who dresses up. Alright, people will get

1124
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,640
an extra tenth of a percentile point added if they

1125
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:49,600
have the following items. They dress up like an A-Team member or they wear an orange afro.

1126
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Okay. Only orange? Stand by to win. Wow. No. What about red? Orange. Why? Because it's

1127
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,800
the Wow Wow 70s. And Orange Lounge is sponsoring the tournament. Or you know if you wear a

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,120
just to go ahead and give a brief recap we're going to have a freestyle on

1176
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,360
both machines

1177
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:46,160
So, for all of you people who are listening on Sunday in the future for us and the current day for you,

1178
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,360
we are going to be running fourth mix freestyle first,

1179
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:57,660
so make sure that you decide on your song at registration or pre-registration

1180
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,260
so that we can make sure that we have the machine set up for you.

1181
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:04,860
You know, there's going to be no changing your mind once we get to the machine

1182
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,360
unless the song happens to be in that machine.

1183
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,060
You lay down the law.

1184
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,700
Damn straight, or damn gay.

1185
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,700
One of them too?

1186
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,700
What?

1187
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,700
Dan Skippy!

1188
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,300
One other thing we should talk about, Shaft.

1189
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,940
We're going to have door prizes out the ass at Shaft, and a lot of that's going to be

1190
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,300
thanks to the big Shaft right here.

1191
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,300
Matt himself.

1192
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,140
Tell us about some of the lovely door prizes people can expect to see at Shaft.

1193
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:35,780
You can expect to see a whole bunch of DVDs provided by ADV Films.

1194
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:39,780
Yes, lots and lots of DVDs to be had.

1195
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,780
Lots and lots of DVDs.

1196
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,780
Are you bribing people to come?

1197
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,780
No, but there will be lots and lots of DVDs.

1198
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,780
Lots and lots and lots of...

1199
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,780
Now what about tapes for those people living in the Dark Ages still?

1200
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,780
Uh...

1201
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,780
Lots of DVDs.

1202
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,780
I suppose I could provide some tapes.

1203
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
I think we can do that.

1204
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,780
But you shouldn't be living in the Dark Ages.

1205
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,780
Come out.

1206
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,560
I want a laser disc.

1207
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,000
Come out and get some Shaft.

1208
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,800
Come to Shaft.

1209
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,520
Mr. T ate my balls.

1210
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,280
So that's why it was singing Take Me Higher.

1211
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,400
Take me higher.

1212
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,720
Hey, we were talking about Maimani.

1213
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,120
We were talking about Shaft.

1214
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,840
We can shake it.

1215
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Anything else you want to talk about, Shaft?

1216
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,120
We are having special prizes.

1217
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:38,120
They are secret prizes. Only Rob and I know what they are. Remember?

1218
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,120
We know what the prize is. Shut up!

1219
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Oh yes, uh huh. Big prizes. You're going to want them.

1220
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,120
We are also going to be having a demonstration the day of tournament.

1221
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Are these door prizes?

1222
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,120
These are actual winning prizes.

1223
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:00,120
Door? Damn it! Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it. I want door prizes.

1224
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:05,120
But we are going to also be having a special secret demo that day.

1225
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,120
There's going to be a special demo setup of something secret.

1226
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,120
Yes.

1227
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
Something happy?

1228
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Something super! Something extreme!

1229
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,120
Shut up!

1230
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,120
No, we're not telling, so don't even...

1231
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,120
Don't guess.

1232
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,120
Oh, I wasn't going to guess.

1233
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,120
Oh, okay.

1234
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,120
I was going to say about that new GDR, if you notice the logo, it's...

1235
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,120
It's spelled irk stream

1236
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:33,880
Not extreme the R is before the X look at the logo DDR irk stream actually

1237
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,500
Yeah, it is the prescription symbol the R and the X cross. It's a drug game. They're promoting drug usage. Oh shit

1238
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,960
They're promoting drug use

1239
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,960
They're pointing to the Ray bars

1240
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,560
You are like shit look at this. It's a clown door. It's a little penny door

1241
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,760
Okay train wreck radio

1242
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,600
That was a car.

1243
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
Back to shaft.

1244
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Shut yo mouth.

1245
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Ugh, it feels so good Jamie.

1246
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
I'm sorry.

1247
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Ah!

1248
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,080
Anyway, back to shaft.

1249
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:09,200
We are also planning, assuming that I can find one, we are having special trophies for

1250
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,280
our 18 freestyle winners.

1251
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,280
Ooh.

1252
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,280
Ah.

1253
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,760
We are going to have, as a trophy, secret prizes.

1254
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Well, we could, you know, I mean I'm sure I'll be able to provide like, you know, bronze replicas of certain things if you need, need for that.

1255
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Oh my God.

1256
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
What kind of job are you running on the side, Mookie?

1257
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Winter, get the gold shaft!

1258
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,760
We give him a cold picture of Samuel.

1259
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,760
I hate Orange Lounge Radio. All they ever do is tell potty jokes.

1260
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,760
Pencils rage!

1261
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,760
Anyway, so all of you have to come to Shaft or I'll hunt you down and kick your ass.

1262
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,760
You remember, I know where you live, I saw it on the internet.

1263
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,760
Ha ha ha ha.

1264
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,760
Let's change gears completely, if you don't turn around Shaft.

1265
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,760
I want to talk about another game I just got to play for the first time yesterday.

1266
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,760
Drummania seventh mix.

1267
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,760
8th Mix is.

1268
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,760
Ewwww.

1269
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,760
And here's our other Universal Fuck Universal Golf Plan.

1270
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Fight our ass.

1271
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,480
It's fun.

1272
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,280
Was there anything that you enjoyed about Drummania 7th Mix?

1273
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,600
I enjoyed playing Another World, but I hated that it wasn't Gax singing it.

1274
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,160
I'm glad I can actually pass a song now.

1275
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,960
Breakdown owned me.

1276
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,440
Breakdown the video to Breakdown rules.

1277
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,240
It's a little girl voice.

1278
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,580
It's so cute.

1279
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:41,100
It's like, well think about the how to spring video where you had a little panda, that was

1280
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
cool too.

1281
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,100
Oh, pandas are cool.

1282
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,700
Okay, well you know all the girls doing doo doo doo doo doo, that that's not cool.

1283
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,780
What's wrong with you?

1284
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,780
I like animals.

1285
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,940
They did put in a new panda song in there though.

1286
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,940
Hello.

1287
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,860
There's the one that's got the heart in the front and the back, I don't know what it says,

1288
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,860
do you know the name of it?

1289
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,860
No I don't.

1290
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,660
And Bradley doesn't know the name of it, nobody does.

1291
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:04,820
It's got a girl writing on like a silver surfer board type thing and there's two pandas flying

1292
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,820
with her.

1293
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,820
It's pretty neat.

1294
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,820
Silver Surfer was cool.

1295
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,820
What? I'm not talking about Silver Surfer.

1296
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,820
Nerd.

1297
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,820
You said the Silver Surfer!

1298
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:13,820
Nerd.

1299
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,820
So.

1300
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,820
Nerd.

1301
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:16,820
So.

1302
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,820
Nerd.

1303
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,820
So.

1304
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,820
Dork.

1305
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,820
So.

1306
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,820
Okay.

1307
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,820
This is great radio, ladies and gentlemen.

1308
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,820
I hate Orange Lounge Radio.

1309
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,820
All they ever do is fight.

1310
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,820
Dear Diary, I listened to this show today called Orange Lounge.

1311
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,820
First of all, I hate Orange Lounge.

1312
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,820
Those little girls are stealing all of my fender.

1313
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,820
Oh, wait.

1314
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,820
That's the radio show and not the...

1315
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,820
Dear diary, today I've got a new hairdo.

1316
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,820
Loki wants to say something.

1317
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:44,820
Dear diary, kill me now. Oh, yes.

1318
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:51,820
Totally off the topic here, but on the fourth mix, fellatio, it almost owned me.

1319
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,820
Fellatio?

1320
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,820
Fellatio almost owned me, there.

1321
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,820
Everybody knows.

1322
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,820
Fellatio what?

1323
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,820
But I kicked pink taco's ass.

1324
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,820
Well, fellatio always owns me.

1325
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:08,460
Yeah. What do you think about that?

1326
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,540
I think. They're full. I feel.

1327
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:15,740
Um.

1328
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:19,100
Oh shit. You know what? I'm not doing that.

1329
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,900
It's gonna be me.

1330
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:27,180
I'm gonna get hit. My idea of what can make this show better,

1331
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,220
let's all get drunk and then do it. Oh my God. We're actually

1332
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:34,220
planning a drunk show. Whenever the next three day weekend is

1333
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,660
We're doing the drunk show. I don't know when that is for Jamie and I when we both have a holiday

1334
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:40,140
We'll find one. It's gonna make one if we have to

1335
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:46,380
We're getting eggnog it's still eggnog radio

1336
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,920
Because it's got dairy crap in it. Well, then you can just drink tequila

1337
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:57,900
We'll give you a whiskey enema I drank last night I had I had red

1338
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,620
I'm not it I'm not an alcoholic I sort of know Red Bull mixed with Malibu is

1339
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:08,460
really good that sounds gross red they call it a pebble it was it or is pebbles

1340
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,620
or pebble I don't know a dyke made it so it might have been pebbles I think you

1341
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:17,220
were just too drunk to know by the way Red Bull if you pour it into a clear

1342
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:24,180
glass it is the color of urine one of my friends one of my friends one of my

1343
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:28,740
friend says that red bull smells like pussy what do you think well first of

1345
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:53,020

1346
01:10:53,020 --> 01:11:06,300
around going cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck! Can you say the C-bomb on here? Cunt! This is all

1347
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,920
Brad does on the show is he comes in and no well no he doesn't just say cut he

1348
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,840
comes in and just swears because since we're internet we can say anything we

1349
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,240
say he has to make out for the rest of us if you really wanted to remember this

1350
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:27,240
This may be adult content, but it's, you know, recess humor.

1351
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,240
Recess? I thought recess was like six, right?

1352
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,240
It's bathroom humor.

1353
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,240
Orange Lounge Radio, we cater to seven-year-olds.

1354
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,240
Poopy! Freak poopy!

1355
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,240
Doggy doo!

1356
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,240
Let's hear it for the DDR free filters.

1357
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,240
What?

1358
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,240
The most fun filters in the world.

1359
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,240
We have more candy.

1360
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,240
Yeah

1361
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,500
No, they can't see us dance on the radio

1362
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,440
What I mentioned these tape shows tend to get a little too weird

1363
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:28,480
just want to remind our listeners that as they're signing off yeah how about

Who'd want to put their hands on Sinead O'Connor?

1440
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,380
There's flowers in the background and look, I'm Sinead O'Connor and I'm dancing.

01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,780
Boy, I can't dance.

01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,880
Hey, look, it's MC Light and she's going to rap.

1451
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,040
but Duran Duran's song stuck in my head. I was sitting at my desk singing the reflex.

1452
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:44,940
I didn't see the reflex, but I saw View to a Kill.

1453
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,740

1459
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,760

Experimental and sucky radio.

1583
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:18,260
Hey, this radio doesn't suck.

1584
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,260
Hey, Brad left his napkin. What an ungrateful little bastard.

1585

1588
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,260
Okay, you do that.

1589
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,260

1824
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,980

1829
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:18,020
Look how the monitor totally bends at a 45 degree angle when she plays.

1830
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:21,020
This game kicks Beachhead's 2000s ass.

1831
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:29,020
But it doesn't have the cool bubble for the sumo, like sumo ass.

1832
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,020
True, that's true. It's not sumo, but it's old school Sega.

1833
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:39,020
Super, recording their songs and shit.

1834
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,020
Nah, fuck em.

01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:45,020
We play it for money, we just gotta work on it.

1836
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,020
It's free promotion.

1837
01:43:47,020 --> 01:44:14,460
Oh, she's reloading.

1838
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,980
Super zapper recharge.

1840
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,460
how come the machine doesn't do loop-de-loop so she does

1841
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:30,940
how come the machine doesn't blow up so she does?

1842
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:33,300

1843
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,460

Broccoli.

1850
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,220
Hey, Matt, something.

1851
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,180
Low-key lesson of the day.

1852
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:58,260
Don't drink 44 ounces of Hep C and play Cata Doubles all day.

1853
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:00,980
How about don't go eat a bunch of Mongolian barbecue

1854
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:02,660
and then play three eight-footers in a row?

1855
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,260
I can't play double Cata's anyways.

1856
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,220
Last time I was here, I had just gotten an eating mongo

1857
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:10,660
chow, and I played Superstar, Pollock, and Spin the Disc

1858
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,300
all in a row.

1859
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,460
Maybe I should get some Mike's Heart of Lemonade

1860
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:16,140
because I think an alien's going to pop out of my chest.

1861
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:22,100
Good just you know as long as you're actually a real person and not like a city drink like 12 of them in an hour

1862
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:27,180
You look really and for the truck right now. Loki is our sweat elemental

01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,940
Smash that. Uh-huh. Hit it

1877
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:48,920
Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, there's a dude on the roof. You should have killed him

1878
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:56,660
Don't run that gives you more time. We'll get the shiny balloons map

1879
01:46:56,660 --> 01:47:01,660
For the record, Rob is owning at this game for his first time.

1880
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:06,660
He's got an eight perfect balloon run.

1881
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,660
He just got two and one.

1882
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:09,660
Turn around, you've got one balloon.

1883
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,660
You need to get six.

1884
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:11,660
You need to get six more balloons.

1885
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:13,660
What?

1886
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,660
Shit.

1887
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,660
Go in the hole.

1888
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,660
This is such crap.

1889
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:18,660
Go down.

1890
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,660
Go down under the waterfall.

1891
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:21,660
Go down.

1892
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,660
Here he goes.

1893
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,660
He's going down, folks.

1894
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,660
Shit, I missed it.

1895
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:27,660
That's okay, you've got more stuff here.

1896
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,660
Ooh, get the pink one!

1897
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,660
What's that one?

1898
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,660
Rob goes for 20 for 10 seconds.

1899
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,660
And he has increased his time.

1900
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,660
He has...

1901
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,660
So far his score is a whopping...

1902
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,660
He has 12,100...

1903
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,660
No, that's 2,150 points.

1904
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:44,660
Wow, we can't read.

1905
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,660
And now he's out of the cave.

1906
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,660
And he's going into the tent.

1907
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,660
I'm flying!

1908
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,660
I'm flying!

1909
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,660
Now he comes out of the tent.

1910
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:57,660
Oh, I was whomped.

1911
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,660
I was whomped.

1912
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:01,660
No, you can't say that's another inside joke with the white boys.

1913
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,660
Here we go.

1914
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:03,660
Ooh, hit that shit.

1915
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:04,660
Go faster.

1916
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,660
Get it, it's 500, it's 500.

1917
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,660
No, it's 200, I can't read.

1918
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:09,660
Ooh, there's another one.

1919
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,660
Ooh, you got it.

1920
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,660
You got four more balloons.

1921
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,660
Yeah, Rob's going to crash.

1922
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,660
That's a wall.

1923
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,660
Oh, shit.

1924
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:19,660
Yes, this game is brought to you by Doom Honor.

1925
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,660
This game is brought to you by Oh Shit.

1926
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,660
No, it's Namco.

1927
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,260
a fan what's-his-name? Remember, Namco owns your soul

1928
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:31,980
I died. So what do you think of Prop Cycle? That was actually pretty- oh dude it shows

1929
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:36,660
I had no sense of direction. Pop 4 Balloons

1930
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:40,980
and Rob got Wing Leader for his first time that is not bad

1931
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:44,740
That's like third place music. That was kind of fun. It would have been better if the game actually had sound

1932
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:49,860
because I'll tell you that was like the worst radio ever. Uh oh

1933
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:52,900
Matt's gonna play- dude don't you have to pee? Dude wait wait

1934
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:59,900
Missile command. Centipede. Millipede. Remember, what is centipede and millipede famous for?

1935
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:04,900
The one sound. That's your one-up noise.

1936
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:09,900
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's the difference between centipede and millipede?

1937
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:10,900
I don't remember.

1938
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,900
There's a punching bag game on the trees.

1939
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,900
Hey, what's the difference between centipede and millipede?

1940
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,900
Millipede is faster and harder and it's longer.

1941
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:18,900
Like Shaft?

1942
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,900
It's faster, harder, and longer, just like Shaft.

1943
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:32,900
Okay. As Matt goes for, ooh, the hard level. The solitaire. Oh, dude, that dude has wings.

1944
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,900
Brought to you by him. And he is going for it with a vengeance.

1945
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:42,900
One hundred. And another hundred. Ooh, a choo-choo train. And a train. A choo-choo.

1946
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:47,900
Train wreck radio. I remember this level being really hard. What the hell? That's a...

1947
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:54,060
to dive through the hole. And he got it the one that was in the hole. And now he's heading

1948
01:49:54,060 --> 01:50:01,060
into the cave. Loki go down the hole. I want to flush the body. What happens when he gets

1949
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:08,400
a thousand right there? Oh he almost. And now he is in the subway. Getting hit by. Running

1950
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:12,000
into polls this game is full of polls and holes

1951
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,960
holes and holes

1952
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:22,800
and he's got another 10 seconds but he's only got 31 left

1953
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:28,240
what's the thousand mean what thousand the thousand below his score

1954
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:32,720
that's lovely

1955
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,960
wow he's kind of good at this game

1956
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,960
He advanced one day. Day one.

1957
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,960
Day? Whoa, he's been flying for a whole day, folks.

1958
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,960
And he's chasing another balloon around a girder, and he decided not to go at it.

1959
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:52,960
He's going into another hole.

1960
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,960
It's just me. It's me, Mario. No, you're not Mario.

1961
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,960
Not Mario! Mario! See, I told you. Whoa, shit.

1962
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,960
Dude, that chick would kick my ass. And he got another ten seconds and ran into a wall.

1963
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,520
and i want to hear about your ass and apparently you cannot knock down the people that are in the

1964
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:16,080
fuck that that's scary and time is up so how well did it look scary

1965
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,880
two points for one play on this game i think that's we got 1400 points he completed the level

1966
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:29,760
and he gets an ending no dude that's coffee man joe hey it's rio from the i made it dude

1967
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,200
the guy in prop cycle looks like rio from digimon oh no he's now going to day two

1968
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:41,760
i didn't get day two you didn't get enough points you no actually he did

1969
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,600
he did the first thing where you only play once

1970
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:52,880
these people are scaring me i don't see exactly how this goddamn punching bag game oh there it is

1971
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,880
It pops down.

1972
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,880
So are we ready to close the show?

1973
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,880
I don't know. Where's the clock?

1974
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,880
Dude, we have like another minute and a half to fill.

1975
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,880
Oh.

1976
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,880
Last segment five minutes earlier.

1977
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,880
Oh, that's right.

1978
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
This is such awful radio.

1979
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,880
What can we do that's exciting for listeners?

1980
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,880
Strip!

1981
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Let's start streaking through Scandinavia.

1982
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,880
Let's see who gets caught first.

1983
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,880
Then we're sure not to have Turney here.

1984
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:26,080
know that I'm from here. They don't know me. Let's take a tour around the rest of the arcade

1985
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:30,280
shall we? Let's go play Bubble Bobble. Where's Bub- I thought I heard Bubble Bobble. Did

1986
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:35,160

1987
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:40,720
doesn't have Bubble Bobble loaded yet. It's going to have it in there. So let's- They're

1988
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:47,720
playing the punching bag game. It's scary. That is not Punch Mania by the way. Alrighty.

1989
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:54,720
Alrighty. Wow. I want to see what a weakling I am. I'm going to get more tokens, okay?

1990
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:59,720
Let's go ahead and do the...you know there's two centipede machines here.

1991
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,720
Let's walk around and poke at stuff.

1992
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,720
Alright. Well, everyone heard After Burner, which I played because I'm cool.

1993

We have centipede. We have one of the best shooter games ever, Raiden Fighter.

1994
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,720
Oh dude, you can buy this shit for a thousand bucks.

1995
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,720
Wow, a thousand for centipede. I can play it on my Atari 5200 at home.

1996
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,120
So we have we got a Harley game

2011
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,640

01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,280
let's see what is the economy

2023
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,440
On the meter is, he hit 290.

2024
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:47,520
Okay, he gets to hit it again.

2025
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,600
290.

2026
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,720
I think Rob gets one more try.

2027
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,880
Dude, you didn't even get a rating.

2028
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,680
Rob did not register.

2029
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,760
Let me try.

2030
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:01,060
Rob's gonna give me money to play.

2031
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:06,000
Who holds what? I'm gonna probably get really bad.

2032
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,160
If you do better than Rob, you get to autograph something for yourself.

2033
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:11,060
Alright, here's the microphone.

2034
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,760
Okay, here we go. Jamie's gonna...

2035
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:15,180
She's gonna show off what a stud she is.

2036
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:16,640
Here she goes. Uh-oh.

2037
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:17,780
She's revving up.

2038
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:23,140
Oh, cracking her knuckles? Oh, cracking her knuckles.

2039
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,740
Here she goes.

2040
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:30,180
She also got 290. You know, I think 290 is what you get when you hit it so weak

2041
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,220
it didn't even register.

2042
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:34,220
Try again. Try again, Jamie.

2043
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,260
Don't let that scary off.

2044
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,580
How many times did you put... How many points did you put in?

2045
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:38,780

2046
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,200

2047
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:40,980

2048
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,100
how come nobody's registering to let me i'm a child while i'm gonna do it

2049
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,840
