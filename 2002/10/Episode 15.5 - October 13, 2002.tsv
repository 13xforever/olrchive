24225	24905	Boring!
29210	30952	This video sucks!

53513	55574	The galaxy is at peace.
68655	71917	I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.
72417	75218	My kind of people and assholes.
75959	76319	One.

136013	137853	But you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
137873	144955	This is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 15 and a half for this October the 13th, I think.
145115	145835	No, today's the 10th.
145855	146815	Today's the 10th.
146835	148395	Because I spent all day writing the 10th.
148435	151896	We're taping on Thursday, so let me do the math real fast.
152196	153796	Yes, the 13th.
153876	155696	13th of October.
156096	157537	You are listening to a pre-taped show.
157937	158217	Why?
158277	159857	Because Jamie and I are lazy.
160017	161317	We want to take a weekend off.
161337	161977	We want a weekend off.
161997	165178	Let me introduce for everybody out there, by the way, if you don't know her, you should.
165919	167139	It's Jamie Summers, ladies and gentlemen.
169540	171240	Oh my god, that's a first for this show.
171880	174961	Now that's usually me on Under Sedation Live.
176601	179861	That burp was brought to you by Berry Flavored Propel, a product of Gatorade.

190523	192164	You might know me also as Skye.
192524	192984	I don't know you.
193824	194464	Yes, you do!
195313	196034	You think you know me.
196654	197495	You will never know me.
197935	199536	You are lost and scared.
201077	202258	You're just a puppet.
204579	205000	Can I finish?
205060	205460	Can I finish?
205560	206721	Can I finish?
207281	209583	Hey, it was an obscure wrestling reference, you know.
211224	213926	Usually we'd be taking a break right now for the opening of the show, but we're not.
214006	216408	We're just going to kick right into things, start off the show here.
217008	217989	Let me introduce everybody who's here.
218009	220851	We've got a nice little crowd of people going on here at Scandia tonight.
220871	221811	They look very nice to me.
221831	222492	They look kind of mean.
224928	226809	They're all glaring going, what the hell is going on here?
228390	231071	This, by the way, is the site of DDR Shaft.
232512	237914	Sacramento hosts another... Sacramento, or Sacramento, sorry, hosts another fucking tournament.
238114	239134	I mean, fabulous tournament.
241255	243816	On November 9th, and Jamie will give us more details on that later.
244156	246197	But first, I would like to introduce everybody that's here tonight.
246237	246897	I'll start over here.
247298	248478	We've got Derek.
248498	249799	I remembered.
250119	251479	Yes, I remembered your real name for once.
251499	253020	But what would the online folks know you as?
254295	255496	Depends how long they've been there.
256316	257336	Let's say the recent folks.
257736	258456	Phalanx Zero.
259097	259757	Phalanx Zero.
259777	261117	Ooh, what an evil sounding name.
262178	263638	Hey, you'd get it if you read X-Men.
263658	265299	Phalanx X-Men?
266439	266779	Yeah.
267019	267399	What?
267499	270360	It was the whole thing that they introduced the Generation X in.
270600	271300	That sucks.
271941	272941	I'm original.
274261	274841	Hee hee.
275702	275942	No.
277262	278603	No, that's bad.
279223	282024	Now, I see the lovely lady that's with you here tonight is a little bit radio shy.
282044	283244	She's farting.
285113	285834	She's retarded.
285854	287595	That's not a nice thing to say to your lady friend.
287615	288436	You should smack him.
288456	290357	No, that's the nicest thing I said all day.
290377	292198	What do you have to say in response to that?
293119	294880	Just call him an ass like I always do.
295300	295481	Ass!
295541	296101	Hey, man.
296441	297082	What's your name, dear?
297462	297842	Lizzie.
298283	300404	And you're not really in the DDR community, though, right?
300884	301905	I play a little bit of DDR.
301925	303226	That's about it.
304207	305408	I'll ask the big newbie question.
305628	306729	What footers are you on?
306969	309471	Are you on five footers or seven footers?
310291	311652	Six, seven, something like that.
311992	313373	Round of applause for the six and seven.
313393	314054	Yay!
314074	314134	Woo!
316264	317345	Say hello everybody to J.B.
345393	347074	Jenny Rom owned me at Max 2.
347214	350396	Did she smack your ass and call you Papa?
350416	351076	He's our Jenny Rom fanboy.
351096	351477	Jenny Rom.
351497	353178	What is it about Jenny Rom that's so fucking cool?
368724	390776	I don't even know who she is Jenny Rom, you know I know what song she sings, they're annoying She has like this annoying, high-ass voice It's just like He doesn't know He just likes Oh, that was Oh shit, that's me She's like Too Much Coffee Woman Oh, the lady on the megaphone?
391756	393557	No, Jenny Rom Oh, Jenny Rom, oh, I'm sorry
395518	398139	You wouldn't be making fun of the... Someone put her processor on overdrive.
398159	401580	Uh-oh, he said the line.
401820	402280	Oh, ass!
402900	404360	No, I said Almas.
404640	405741	He said Almas.
405761	406761	No, Satan!
407401	408442	No!
408522	411442	This is going to be one of those shows where we have to fight with a loudspeaker the whole time.
412743	414443	It is an experimental show, ladies and gentlemen.
414463	414943	Let me remind you.
415003	421125	And remember, if you can't be... And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
423118	423939	Yes, I like Grease.
424680	425901	I hate that damn movie.
425941	427082	I've seen it 50 million times.
427202	428864	I know all the damn songs.
429304	430145	Grease is classic.
430205	430806	It's on DVD now.
430826	431286	No, it's Satan.
431627	432307	Grease is Satan.
432467	433388	Why is Grease Satan?
433408	434009	What's wrong with you?
434289	438874	Because my sister watched it like five times a day for like three weeks straight.
438934	440636	Grease came out when I was like two.
440676	441657	No, not cool.
441697	442618	I was enjoying her.
443860	448402	Okay, when I was eight years old, I watched the movie Clue every day for an entire summer.
448722	449543	I liked that movie.
450123	451243	Now you're back on my good side.
451383	451944	You better stay there.
452344	453244	That's like four endings.
453324	453684	No, three.
453925	454325	That's three.
455165	456666	I think they're making actually a Grease 3.
456766	457106	What?
458026	458667	They better not.
458947	459487	Yes, they are.
459527	461468	And by the way, Clue had Tim Curry.
462328	463209	Yeah, Tim Curry kicked ass.
463229	464949	And what else was Tim Curry in?
465710	466230	Rocky.
466570	467030	Yay!
468951	470152	Why would they make a great Grease 3?
471907	473969	Grease 3 starring the Olivia Project.
474229	476171	Have you never been there?
476211	478673	You had a car in the first, the cars in the first one.
479173	482536	You had microphones in the second, microphones, motorcycles in the second one.
482556	484097	What are you going to have next, a moped?
484337	485478	It's a high school reunion.
486479	487240	Oh, that'd be kind of cool.
487460	488981	It's bringing back the original cast, too.
489281	489962	That would be cool.
490122	493084	So it's like instead of Romy and Michelle, it's John and Olivia's high school reunion?
494225	494626	Cool.
496247	497408	Oh, yeah, we're a Bomani show, huh?
497428	497528	Hi.
499102	501284	You're listening to... You said Olivia Project, so it counts.
501384	503385	Yeah, okay, yeah, sorry, I made a reference.
503425	503706	Xanadu!
503726	505627	I forgot that other song, but... Xanadu!
505687	506347	Xanadu!
506388	507108	Thank you.
507248	508329	Which was also a good movie.
509630	512972	I don't know, Jamie, you said you'd be the only person... Yes, Xanadu was a movie that came out in 1990, I mean 1980.
513093	515895	Jamie, name me one other person in the Xanadu fan club.
516175	520118	Huh?
520138	521659	Who else is in the Xanadu fan club but me?
522460	522920	And my friend.
523567	524347	And your friend, who's your friend?
524608	529290	Well, my friend, Gwen, who listens in Maryland, who's trying to listen anyway.
529330	529910	Hi, Gwen.
529930	532171	If you happen to be listening, then hi.
532271	532572	Hi.
533852	535353	I need to put a plug in for the chat room.
535373	538454	There's probably people there chatting, even though we're not really doing a show tonight.
538475	539155	People there all the time.
539175	539735	They have no life.
539815	540435	Oh, hi, JB.
541556	541956	No, we're kidding.
541976	542537	We love our chatters.
543077	545058	Since he's here, he's got... Since he's here, he's not in this chat room.
545858	546839	Well, he could be.
548019	548319	Huh?
548840	548920	Huh?
549160	549720	Oh, that's right.
549760	551541	If it retains, he might be there Sunday night.
551561	552862	How is this for a paradox?
553162	553342	Huh?
553880	556261	Twilight Zone.
558841	567104	To join our chat room, just go to any other site IRC server like irc.eggheads.org and you're just going to join Channel Pound, Orange Lounge.
567384	572525	We've got to get interviewed.
572545	574786	There's some other people here I want to interview while they're here too.
575066	576186	I will go kidnap people.
576406	578187	We've got to get Keith before he leaves.
580586	587092	I should say, actually I should start this week's episode by saying, you're listening to the most extreme station of all things Bomani.
588393	589494	It's extreme.
590455	591976	Speaking of extreme.
592657	593918	We can touch on that a little bit now.
593958	597281	We'll get into it in more depth later, because we're getting people to interview.
598061	601024	Let's talk about, what is so extreme about this week's show?
602445	605028	Well, first off... What the fuck was that right now?
605128	605588	What was that?
605748	607029	That's corny as hell.
607109	607410	What?
610701	614024	First off, we do have a new record holder.
614805	622792	Oh yes, before the show, Loki, world record champion on Conjoined Twin Galaxies, except we didn't have a video camera to tape it, so it won't count.
623072	624754	But, when we do get a camera...
625555	631058	He will, except Black Lab has sworn to me he will destroy the world record no matter where it's at.
631098	632239	He will train long and hard.
632499	635041	He's going to be like Sylvester Stallone in Rocky.
635461	636341	He's going to beat that record.
636361	637522	Let's just put it this way.
637622	645807	The record was so sad that actually me, who can't perfect the tackle or shit, beat the record by like a good 40 or 50 million points.
646027	647048	It's freaking cold out here.
648869	654072	I mean, I could have played the last song, Dynamite Rave, doing freestyle and still would have beat that stupid record.
655021	657042	We can say Raven, he can't play that.
657843	659684	I can go back and edit it in the show later.
661145	662245	I need a hug!
663146	664647	The person we wanted to interview left.
664787	665307	That sucks.
665847	666408	What about Jer?
666448	667168	Is Jer still in there?
667448	668349	Jer's gonna come.
668449	670450	Oh, dude, go interview that guy over there.
670710	671451	Is the gazebo empty?
672091	672591	The gazebo?
672711	673412	The gazebo.
673432	674592	The gazebo we go.
674752	676874	We can do anything we want while this show's going.
676914	677754	We migrate to the gazebo.
677794	678855	We're walking over to the gazebo.
679858	681679	No, you can't swim in the pond, but you can be there.
681699	686942	We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and do golf claps and shit.
687002	688482	I'm sorry, the listeners couldn't hear you.
688762	693945	We should interview everybody that comes to the 18th hole and clap for them and stuff, even though they suck.
694305	695606	Ah, now this is a great table.
696006	697027	This is a big table.
697427	698207	Wind shielded.
698427	699068	Wind shielded.
699108	703570	Dude, this is like the carpet that they put on the walls at roller rinks.
703950	707732	Now you guys on that side are going to have to raise your hand if you want to talk, so I can hand you a microphone.
709668	710289	No, you can't yell.
712350	713311	Slighty song.
714471	715332	I finally passed that.
715932	718714	So, let's talk about DDR Extreme.
719315	719755	Yay!
720035	721176	DDR Sexstream!
721256	721676	Let's change.
721896	723057	Derek, let's change.
723798	724178	If we can.
724198	725719	I don't change for anyone.
725759	726800	You can sit on that side of the table.
726820	727400	I'll sit on this side.
727760	729181	This is really great radio, by the way.
734145	734925	Alright, here we go.
735286	735666	Hello!
735926	736787	Hi, other side of the table.
736907	736967	Hi!
740529	749975	So, I guess, I always saw Loki as kind of our news desk of the show, so I'll let him talk about DDR Extreme, even though he's not prepared to.
750015	751136	But I'm sure he'll have something nice to say.
751436	754998	By the way, Loki now doing news for Team Guilo.
755058	755779	Congratulations.
756779	758100	I actually have a comment about that.
758120	759761	This is kind of an F-you to myself.
761491	772483	I was viciously pointed out by DJ Paranoia to have copied his list and put it on Team Guilo, which is a big, big, big, big, big, big note of if you don't give credit.
773124	774265	No, that's plagiarism.
777759	783281	And anyways, to begin with, okay, first off, I copied Black Lab's list to begin with, okay?
783721	787402	And that list... Yeah, it doesn't matter about him.
787462	789503	So I took his list at first.
789543	794165	It didn't have any frickin' names on it or none of the artists' names, so that kind of sucked.
794565	795965	So I borrowed his list.
796085	800227	I forgot to put... I mean, shit, man, I'm putting this list up, like, way early in the morning.
800327	801407	I'm so damn tired.
802547	807069	I do that, and then finally it doesn't hit me until he's like, "'Ass, thanks for stealing my list.'"
808201	810644	So I've been hearing about it for like the last three days.
810764	817753	You know, gave big credit to him and their, you know, Bomani style for translating Naoki's journal to make it actually legible.
818234	819996	The big question is, did you guys kiss and make up?
820965	828635	No, but I kissed ass, I sent him emails, PMs, I even apologized to Spigamas in the DDR Maniacs chatroom.
828935	835343	So hopefully some way he got the message that I am gratefully sorry and would be happy to make it up to him.
835383	838126	Maybe he shared resources for some story or whatnot.
840148	840689	No.
840869	843391	No, no, there will be no putting out, okay?
844011	845472	I'm sorry, that's not happening.
845552	850155	But I think I've gone, you know, above and beyond to apologize for a simple mistake.
850235	852096	I mean, that got fixed within a couple hours.
852156	854218	You've gone down and apologized.
854378	859822	And look, if he gives you hell for it, just use the Nifty at Global Gate translator because it does it nearly perfectly anyway.
860242	860922	Well, it wasn't that.
860982	863904	It was just I used his list that had the names on it.
864084	865786	Whoop-de-de-doo.
865826	866546	Whoop-de-shit.
866566	868828	You know, I could have just done the list myself.
870469	878179	No, I'm not plagiarizing anymore, but if I were, I certainly would reformat the shit so it wouldn't look anything like anyone else's.
878399	880842	You just plagiarized Black Lab, because that's okay.
881182	885287	That doesn't matter, he's in our... He's probably in the chatroom right now.
885307	886028	He's nobody important.
886068	886629	In the future.
887501	889101	Sorry, Black Lab, I didn't mean that.
889582	891362	No, but anyways, yeah, so I'm doing news now.
891382	897224	It kind of sucks because now I have to be on top of all the news stories instead of browsing the internet and, you know, chatting in chat rooms.
897244	899844	You're on top, going down, bending over backwards.
899924	901565	Good lord, you're an acrobat.
901745	903545	Down, down, down.
904526	905066	Yeah, so...
907000	915768	Hey, but one of the things I was able to have that no one else did have is I actually got those clips from the DDR Max USA, all the new samples.
915808	922274	They're supposedly going to be in there because everyone gave me shit about that too, saying, oh, how do you know that shit's going to be in there?
922654	923435	It's not confirmed?
923635	924696	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
925056	926197	Like, I really give a shit.
926217	928039	I'm just ripping samples for people to hear.
929240	930281	I have a comment on that.
930882	933743	If they're not going to be in the game, why do they exist?
934003	935844	Now, the old stuff, I understand.
935904	936424	Konami?
936644	937044	Lazy?
937224	937645	Certainly.
937905	942486	They leave the old stuff from Max Japan in there, like Ghost and things like that, and they sneak in there.
943006	946648	You know, but these new remixes weren't just done for the hell of it.
946728	949909	Well, I don't know, maybe Naoki gets bored one night, he's doing his nails, like, hmm.
950209	959316	Maybe I'll remix, uh... Dear Diary, I ran out of black fingernail polish, so I decided to remix a new song with my best buddy.
959816	962719	Why would they be in there if they're not going to be in the final game?
962839	965921	Does it just specifically throw us off?
965941	971045	Well, even if it is just there to throw us off, hey, it's a new Bomani remix clip, that's newsworthy.
971925	976649	Well, then the fact that Kakumei was in there, okay, the clip for Kakumei, and they're like,
977205	980246	and some guys like, no, that got cut and so did Ghost.
980666	981566	I know for sure.
981886	984607	Because I'm actually developing the game, so I know.
984647	985327	What's your source?
985647	990228	I'm all, well, shit, man, if you guys got information, start sharing instead of calling me, telling me I'm wrong, you know.
990549	991589	Start sharing some info.
991969	992469	That's right.
993049	993449	That's right.
993529	999911	Unless you work for Konami or you're sleeping with someone who works for Konami, we just can't believe you.
999951	1000371	I'm sorry.
1000411	1002552	We're just going to have to all wait until, you know, the game comes out.
1002632	1003372	So, we'll see.
1005091	1005451	I'm sorry.
1006352	1007994	I'll get right on sleeping with everybody.
1009014	1009215	Huh?
1009395	1009755	You whore.
1010396	1012317	Yeah, kind of.
1012557	1015320	Would anybody at this table put out for information on Max?
1016306	1018066	You guys are sad and pathetic.
1018547	1023488	Rob, first of all, my fiance manages a GameStop.
1023868	1025028	I don't have to put out.
1025148	1026248	It just comes with the job.
1026809	1029929	But does he get information about Konami?
1030409	1030890	Sometimes.
1030910	1034370	Like game releases, but he doesn't really get... No, the reps come to the store.
1034410	1035951	I have information that I can't talk about.
1036471	1039652	I'd go down on some chick at Konami to get information.
1040372	1041472	Just because you'd be getting some.
1044093	1044453	No.
1044473	1044513	No?
1045772	1046493	Not at all.
1046893	1052978	Dear Diary, I went to America one day, and there was this guy there who said he'd put out for information about DDR.
1053198	1053418	That's it.
1053459	1054299	So I put out.
1055200	1056701	Yeah, I said chick.
1057122	1059123	Oh, oh wait.
1060244	1060704	Shit, man.
1061325	1062106	First of all.
1062126	1063207	You ever see The Crying Game?
1064247	1066049	The Crying Game 2 is starring Naoki Midea.
1068657	1071578	I would not want my name mispronounced.
1071598	1073399	There's a pronunciation argument going on over there.
1073419	1075699	I'm just really, really white.
1075719	1077240	Would you want someone to mispronounce your name?
1077720	1078120	They do.
1079241	1080842	Okay, how can you mispronounce Derek?
1080862	1081202	Dark.
1082602	1083543	We can call you Dirk.
1084043	1084483	Jerk.
1085744	1086624	Hey, asshole.
1086944	1087104	Anyways.
1092652	1097295	Um, DDR Extreme, the very gay-ass name that they applied to DDR Max 3.
1097876	1098576	No offense, Drew.
1098596	1102359	No, if they got it DDR Cock Sucking Edition, yes, that would be it.
1102379	1103680	DDR Ass Fuck Extreme.
1104701	1105301	Bar and Grill.
1105481	1108224	Okay, DDR Extreme.
1109404	1111946	Okay, so here's what I'm picturing from DDR Extreme.
1112107	1116350	We're gonna have extreme clips in the background, possibly people doing extreme things.
1117106	1120927	There's going to be extreme songs, and I'm going to get extremely bored with this.
1121387	1130529	But anyway, they had a little voting thing going on that we mentioned last week, announcing some of the... They didn't do it in Florida.
1130549	1132449	As long as there are no songs by extreme.
1133309	1134370	They went out in the 90s.
1134930	1136470	Okay, let me guess.
1136630	1139191	I'm just going to throw out an idea here.
1139611	1140791	Could the next Max be...
1141731	1143152	Max Extreme?
1143172	1146414	No!
1146474	1146754	No!
1147354	1150636	It's the remix of Max 300 by Erotic, Max Sexstream.
1152237	1152977	Oh, Max.
1153978	1155158	Don't have sex with your ex.
1155859	1157320	Oh, dude, that would be fucking sweet.
1157360	1158760	Max, don't have sex with your ex.
1159201	1160541	Dude, it would be evil, too.
1160641	1161982	Dude, that song is awesome.
1162542	1163003	But anyways.
1164023	1167385	Yeah, so some of the new songs that they were mentioning that were up there.
1168050	1169491	They're possibly going to be in there.
1169591	1171493	Not confirmed to be in there, but possibly.
1172093	1172434	Let's see.
1172494	1174635	Start with Beatmania 2DX.
1174675	1177498	You've got V and A. Fuck you, Loki, by the way.
1177838	1179419	Which together is VA.
1180080	1180480	VA.
1181020	1182201	For the veterans or something.
1182241	1182602	I don't know.
1183342	1184803	Anyways, let's see.
1184943	1194271	From Guitar Freaks, there's Elise, 100 Seconds, and something else that's not Fire or Jet World because I really... Yeah, I want a Jet World.
1194291	1195071	That would have been sweet.
1195632	1197013	Fire from...
1197682	1203847	There's a hold on me from, what is it, ParaPara, which everyone's just like, this is crap.
1204388	1208491	Which I agree, you know, I'd rather have, I mean, even like Kingdom of Rock.
1208651	1211293	Dude, Kingdom of Rock would be awesome.
1211474	1214156	Kingdom of Rock or even like Burning Desire.
1215117	1217358	Deluxe, fucking Deluxe in DDR, that would rule.
1221522	1222162	In the microphone, Derek.
1222503	1224905	That's like the only dance I know, I look so gay doing it.
1226030	1227071	Dude, we should have Deluxe.
1227251	1234798	Okay, well, first off, just because these, you know, became, these were on, you know, the top of the list here, doesn't mean that they're not going to throw other stuff in there.
1234838	1236539	So, I mean, it's very possible.
1236679	1238781	I would be happy if Cosmic Cowgirl was in Max.
1239262	1242344	So, I wonder how long this DDR Extreme is going to last.
1242404	1245307	I mean, and what... One week.
1245687	1247489	It's just because I think they changed interface designs.
1247509	1248750	One week since this game came out.
1249070	1251853	One week since I looked at it.
1252634	1255275	The question is, how often will it be bootlegged?
1255535	1258657	Will it be a bigger or more rampant bootleg than Moodleg?
1258677	1259097	Moodleg?
1259417	1261318	Moodleg?
1261418	1262558	I was born for radio.
1264959	1268240	Well, we were having a discussion in the DDR Maniacs chatroom today.
1268461	1272222	We were saying hi to all our friends in the DDR Maniacs chatroom.
1272342	1273303	Hi!
1273443	1273803	Love ya.
1275123	1275884	Oh, sorry, yes, Jamie.
1276544	1278305	I'm an optimist.
1278845	1280586	We've got lots of fans over there, don't we?
1281306	1281466	No.
1283072	1283572	Yes, we do.
1284913	1285153	Yes.
1285774	1286374	We have you.
1286874	1287615	And you're all the fans.
1287635	1292197	Well, I'm speaking to the one fan, Twen, and talking to him today.
1292557	1298321	And we were discussing the fact that DDR Extreme, since it is so extreme, should have a fog machine and lasers.
1299541	1301242	Because who doesn't like a good laser?
1302143	1306926	As I said earlier on another chat board, I said it should be, it's kind of a joke I used earlier, but I don't care.
1306966	1307466	It's still funny.
1307746	1311088	DDR Sex Stream with a big pole in the middle.
1312452	1314013	and all erotic set of songs.
1314153	1315594	You remember what I was saying the other night?
1315754	1315954	What?
1316014	1318016	That it needs the butt pad so you can have booty mode.
1318276	1318636	Oh yeah.
1319256	1322979	They're gonna put a button on the bar so you can like rub your ass against the bar.
1326261	1327141	We need the grind.
1327281	1328022	What were you saying JB?
1329162	1329623	I forgot.
1332219	1338183	Actually, what they're going to do is they're going to have a nice little chair in front of the pads itself.
1338643	1340084	And sitting on the chair will be a mannequin.
1340425	1343347	So you bump and grind against the mannequin to get some bonus points there.
1345688	1348490	And it's going to be one of those real dolls of Naoki.
1348951	1350952	And it's got session mode with Boonga Boonga.
1353634	1355115	Actually, what's scary is...
1356604	1356684	Eek!
1356744	1356844	Eek!
1356864	1356944	Eek!
1356984	1357044	Eek!
1379927	1380427	Beat it, beat it
1411512	1414933	You can either have Beat It by DJ Alligator Project or Erotic.
1420976	1421677	That's my watch.
1421737	1423317	It says, this will explode.
1424038	1425939	This watch has the time of your doom.
1426059	1426839	It's my 007 watch.
1426879	1427980	It's the doomsday clock.
1428600	1430761	They gave out to all the managers of GameStop.
1430781	1431281	11.59 and ticking.
1431722	1432042	I don't know.
1433262	1433543	The time is .59.
1433603	1435003	Time to die.
1440450	1441271	Oh, what nerds are we?
1441451	1446994	So, what other cool things can we expect to see in DDR Extreme?
1448275	1448836	Oh, yes, JB.
1451677	1452578	What about Gillette?
1454199	1455920	Don't want no short dick, man.
1455980	1456861	You remember that song?
1457481	1459262	Maybe I'm going to play that during one of the breaks.
1459462	1465506	If I remember when I'm putting this show together, when I get back home and editing it, I'll put Gillette as one of the songs we'll play.
1466667	1467087	What about what?
1468246	1468886	Tonight's a good song.
1468906	1470266	I'll try to play that for you if I remember.
1471327	1473167	There's the one song that I definitely want played.
1473407	1473747	What's that?
1473967	1475007	Children of the Sandstorm.
1475928	1477248	Now explain this mix.
1478348	1482729	I was looking for a sandstorm because I actually did not have it on my computer.
1482909	1484809	You just couldn't get enough of last week's joke.
1484849	1486470	It was Sunday night after I got home.
1486950	1491591	And I found, for people who are familiar with it, Robert Miles did a song called Children.
1492211	1493871	And I found that mixed with Sandstorm.
1493911	1495011	That was actually pretty nice.
1495051	1496832	That was a huge song when I was in high school.
1496852	1497792	It makes me feel so old.
1498652	1499392	It was a good mix.
1500193	1503614	I mean, it was basically cut and paste type, but it was done very smoothly.
1504054	1505955	Oh, JB left you a present, by the way.
1507176	1509237	Oh, JB, explain the present that you left for Jamie.
1511438	1515820	Okay, it was Dynamite R3, or R5.
1516960	1518861	And explain, tell us a little bit about Dynamite R5.
1519021	1523403	It's Dynamite Rave and R5 mixed together.
1523603	1524744	Excellent, very good, yes.
1526404	1527465	I must listen to this right away.
1528402	1528862	Yes, Golf Land.
1528902	1531845	We are in the gazebo overlooking the lovely course here.
1531885	1534947	I see... This is... We've got a castle right in front of us.
1534967	1536008	And we're not at Golf Land.
1536068	1536408	Wow.
1536809	1537549	Thank God.
1537569	1540111	There's... Assholes?
1540492	1541652	And their stuff's messed up.
1541953	1542233	Yes.
1542813	1546416	Hey, Initial D took my money, but I'm addicted to that game.
1546576	1547617	Okay, fuck the money for a second.
1547637	1548818	I want to talk about Initial D. Oh, wait.
1548838	1551700	Loki had something to say?
1551760	1557325	Um... Yeah, I'm guessing we'll hear... Supposedly what's going to be happening week to week with Naoki...
1557930	1559351	I love that song.
1559451	1560491	Oh, that's right.
1560551	1562873	Another song was announced for DVR Extreme.
1562893	1568056	This is going to be a new Ryu, whatever her damn name is, Kosuka or... I Blow Naoki.
1568196	1569356	Yeah, I Blow Naoki.
1569456	1572118	Ryu, I Blow Naoki.
1572158	1576860	She's doing a song that's called... Shit, I don't know, whatever.
1576920	1578121	It's some stupid song.
1578181	1583784	It's going to be like Candy, but it's supposed to be heavy metal or rock or some crap like that.
1583824	1584825	Wee, wee, wee.
1584905	1585905	Wee, wee, wee.
1585925	1587046	Wee, wee, wee.
1589427	1589787	Wee!
1589827	1590968	Anyways, you guys keep going.
1591008	1592289	I'm gonna run in and see if anyone else showed up.
1593429	1595870	So, yeah, um, Naoki's Journal sucks.
1595890	1598972	They're supposed to be doing, like, some interviews or questionnaires with, uh, staff.
1599012	1600013	They're like, we give a shit.
1601113	1603795	Seeing what the staff thinks about DDR Extreme.
1603815	1605916	They're probably all gonna say, uh, Naoki's gay.
1605956	1606116	DDR!
1607914	1610416	So, um, let's see here.
1611157	1614120	And meanwhile over here, you're hearing voices.
1614500	1618023	Yes, I keep hearing somebody saying my name, and it's not JB.
1618043	1619004	No, they're going...
1619631	1620212	Big fuck!
1620692	1621272	Big fuck!
1621633	1623194	It just sounds like it.
1624515	1629058	Well, since we have this big gap of space here, I'm going to go ahead and do the sim update for this week.
1629619	1632060	And we actually have news this week, which is pretty cool.
1632240	1633682	And it's my turn to excuse myself.
1633722	1634682	Take the mic.
1634742	1635003	Okay.
1635483	1638085	So, here's what's going on in the sim world here.
1639056	1641459	First off, you have a new release of Set Mania.
1641540	1649110	Set Mania, actually, it's kind of been called Beta 6 Release 2, or what they're calling it is Beta 7.
1650171	1652394	And so Beta 7's out now.
1652614	1652755	I've
1653652	1654332	Got it at home.
1654392	1657934	I haven't gotten to try it out yet, but StepMania hasn't disappointed me yet.
1657954	1659554	My StepMania doesn't work on my computer.
1659854	1662155	You used to not like StepMania back in the early versions.
1662475	1663355	You're a liar.
1663616	1665076	You're a liar.
1665696	1678921	StepMania really did disappoint me back in version 1.6, 1.6.5, that area, because it didn't load, and it sucked, and it was really slow, and it was a piece of shit, and DWI kicked his ass.
1679501	1689607	However, since then, since they've gone actually doing public updates, where there's like 30 people working on updating this thing instead of 2, it's gotten a lot better.
1689988	1696652	So you've got now, you have pump support, para-para support, you also have easy-to-dancer support in there, so that's kind of cool.
1698413	1699233	Which means what?
1700534	1702935	Which means you can play those games on that simulator.
1703616	1704096	Okay.
1704736	1705957	Not everybody knows that.
1705977	1706237	Okay.
1707819	1709520	Well... She didn't know!
1709620	1711660	Derek's a little slow.
1712080	1713741	No, I'm fat and I didn't eat today.
1715181	1721083	Anyways, other than that, let's see, on a personal note, I'm putting up DWIs on the internet.
1721163	1724704	I've actually got my own site that's going to be started here pretty soon.
1725044	1726905	LeachFromLoki.com Hey!
1728732	1729212	You know what?
1729252	1730353	That's not a bad name.
1731454	1731894	I rule.
1732755	1735696	I'm gonna call that Leech from Loki.
1736137	1737677	It's awesome, though, because I found a site.
1737798	1740039	It's like gamers.com or some shit like that.
1740599	1742260	Or Gamers Club, I believe it's what it's called.
1742600	1746583	It's 50 megs of web space free and unlimited bandwidth.
1747711	1748151	I love it.
1748272	1749092	Unlimited bandwidth.
1749132	1750213	Shit, I can put stuff on there.
1750233	1751714	No one will worry about my site going down.
1751974	1752494	It's awesome.
1752715	1753956	That's super orgasmic.
1754236	1756517	So I'm going to have my DWIs on there.
1756577	1759960	Plus, really hard to find rare 8-style DWIs.
1759980	1760580	And it's free, right?
1760600	1761361	Yeah, it's free.
1762081	1762942	So it's pretty cool.
1762982	1763662	I'll be doing that.
1763742	1766364	Maybe get a couple of sites if I run out of my 50 megs.
1768046	1769126	You run out of space?
1769607	1770287	That kind of stuff.
1770347	1772309	So look for that pretty soon.
1772389	1773349	I'll announce it later on.
1773910	1775751	Do they bog you down with banner ads or any of that crap?
1776576	1777957	Unfortunately, yes, they do.
1778538	1780159	Nothing is ever really free.
1781139	1783982	Mozilla.com, highly recommended by Orange Lounge staff.
1784182	1786303	Block ads, awesome, love it.
1787724	1789285	Hmm, sounds good.
1789325	1791107	Well, I'll put a link to that on my site.
1791147	1794109	I'm sure they won't like it, but I'll put a link up there.
1794249	1795910	So, yeah, we'll have that.
1796331	1800874	And, see, other than that, I don't know, not too much going on in the sim world.
1800934	1802075	More people releasing stuff.
1802235	1804517	The Euromix DWIs are coming along pretty good on...
1805357	1806177	DDR UK.
1806257	1812620	They've actually got now the official backgrounds for Hysteria 2001 and Before You, Before is the Beat Mix, which is pretty cool looking.
1813641	1819263	And they're also going to be adding the rest of the DWIs, including Caribbean Queen.
1820403	1820803	Oh, no.
1820923	1821704	I love that song.
1822344	1824125	Caribbean Queen.
1824985	1826586	Okay, anyways.
1826946	1828867	So, no more of me singing.
1829747	1830307	Oh, never mind.
1831068	1831708	But, uh...
1833559	1836141	All right, so, are we doing interviews or something?
1836161	1836861	Guess who's back.
1836901	1837882	No, just Jamie.
1838222	1843666	Jamie's coming back, and everybody that we wanted to interview left, so no interviews.
1843926	1844566	Jared's still inside.
1845086	1845747	Yeah, Jared's still inside.
1845767	1846467	He'll come out here later.
1847028	1849609	He's teaching a little kid how to play DDR or something.
1849649	1850750	He already knows how to play DDR.
1850770	1852051	Yeah, I see that kid here a lot, actually.
1852071	1852611	He's like a regular here.
1852631	1853912	He's past the hard stuff.
1853972	1854473	We should get him.
1855373	1856214	We should interview him.
1857234	1858195	He wants to be interviewed.
1858495	1858695	What?
1858835	1859556	He wants to be interviewed.
1859576	1859796	Really?
1859816	1860276	Get him out of here.
1860877	1861357	I don't want to go.
1861897	1862758	If we go inside...
1863902	1864563	We're going inside?
1865343	1867505	Alright, we're going to go inside.
1868306	1869887	While we're migrating.
1870888	1872990	Isn't this a nice, lovely, chilly afternoon?
1873230	1874811	I'm feeling fat and sassy.
1875112	1875772	It's nighttime.
1876052	1876493	It's nighttime.
1876533	1877133	See, dark time.
1877173	1877854	See, there's the moon.
1877874	1878835	I am a banana!
1879595	1881697	That's not a banana, that's the moon!
1882498	1883198	Oh, it's the moon.
1884319	1884720	Is it Mr. Moon?
1884740	1886501	Look how many funny looks we're getting as we come in here.
1887382	1888423	And now we're back inside.
1889884	1892185	We're going into the party room with these lovely people.
1892545	1893585	Hi, lovely people.
1896566	1898506	We're going to hide in the corner where nobody can find us.
1902247	1903467	Now we're at a much smaller table.
1903527	1904568	I feel like I've been demoted.
1905708	1906968	Hey, it's warm in here.
1906988	1910089	I thought we were supposed to shrink with coldness.
1914370	1916070	I was like, dang.
1916591	1917611	Oh, somebody just failed the song.
1917651	1917951	I heard it.
1919468	1920928	Hey now, that's not very nice.
1921548	1923369	We have to be supportive of everybody, remember?
1923409	1924369	We support you!
1925809	1927210	Like a good jockstrap.
1927450	1928290	You are supported.
1930870	1932631	You're just full of jokes today.
1932671	1934871	I'm fucking hyper because I had cupcakes.
1936952	1943053	Take that off of your ear, that's my damn watch.
1943153	1943613	No.
1944833	1945674	Where did Loki go?
1946634	1947554	He went to play his edits.
1950095	1951876	Okay, so what should we talk about now?
1952676	1954277	No, no fucking whistles on.
1955717	1956077	I'm sorry?
1958318	1959699	Thank you, yes.
1959719	1961739	This is fucked up.
1961799	1965020	I don't have Jamie's music and I'm too lazy to put it in.
1965060	1967621	So edit my damn music in.
1968322	1969242	What, Katima style?
1970049	1970509	Who's that?
1971630	1973671	Oh, you haven't heard the Kutimu stuff.
1973872	1977834	It's basically people taking different Bimani songs and singing them.
1977854	1978535	Oh, wait, I've heard that.
1978575	1979295	Loki showed me.
1979335	1980536	They're funny as hell.
1983218	1984559	We'll talk about it more on the show next week.
1985519	1987280	Didn't you put some on the show last week?
1987781	1988621	No, we didn't get around to it.
1988661	1991443	We were going to, but we had just an action-packed show last week.
1991863	1993725	It was an extremely packed show.
1994525	1995486	Enough with that word.
1995786	1996847	No more extreme words.
1997939	1999180	Extreme Radio!
1999941	2001342	You find me to be extremely annoying?
2001362	2003543	No, I find you extremely sexy.
2004063	2004504	Well, thank you.
2004524	2005444	I don't know.
2006245	2008447	Anyway, my fuck you of the week.
2008507	2008747	Yes.
2009607	2010088	I don't know.
2010948	2016032	My fuck you of the week goes towards going home and finding out that Dan ate all the lasagna last night.
2016552	2017233	Lasagna?
2017253	2018574	I like lasagna.
2019674	2021916	And that was going to be my fucking lunch today.
2022216	2022737	What a dick.
2023917	2024778	Who are you talking about?
2024818	2025559	My fiance.
2025579	2026940	Don't call him a dick, asshole.
2028877	2030819	I thought that was a dog or something.
2030839	2033961	I don't know.
2034782	2036043	Jamie doesn't own a dog.
2036683	2038004	You can't be on our show anymore.
2038064	2038585	Go away.
2039546	2040186	I'm serious.
2040246	2040646	Go away.
2041307	2042768	You're not allowed to be on the show anymore.
2045270	2046451	You think I'm kidding, don't you?
2047692	2048653	She's in her randy mode.
2048813	2050594	You think I'm kidding, don't you?
2051215	2051715	Yeah.
2052096	2053337	No, I'm not.
2053397	2057380	During the commercial break, Jamie's going to go kick the crap out of our guests.
2058183	2059364	So, he ate the lasagna.
2060345	2061246	And I didn't have any dinner.
2062047	2062427	What'd you eat?
2062447	2063388	You had to have eaten something.
2063609	2064890	A microwave burrito.
2064910	2066111	A dog.
2066131	2067433	I don't have a dog, shut up.
2068694	2069455	She has a pretty cat.
2069715	2069915	What?
2070996	2071697	I have a Shermie.
2072097	2072358	A what?
2072858	2073198	Shermie.
2073539	2074179	What was his name?
2075561	2077563	Shermie is his name.
2077683	2079144	I have my girl kitty.
2079525	2081167	Shermie isn't a breed of cat.
2082518	2083359	She's a Shermie.
2083379	2085560	Okay, what type of cat is it?
2085580	2086121	A Shermie?
2086301	2087122	It's a she!
2087922	2089604	You're just digging yourself deeper tonight.
2090284	2091465	It's a little gray cat.
2091745	2094728	It's a... She looks like Church from Pet Sematary.
2095588	2096529	Oh, that's actually a good point.
2096549	2097790	You never saw Pet Sematary.
2097810	2098751	I was afraid of it.
2098851	2099692	It was a scary movie.
2099892	2100312	Was?
2100893	2102494	I was afraid of Child's Play.
2102654	2104235	That movie freaked the shit out of me.
2104275	2106417	I don't like little stabby doll things.
2106717	2108238	I was scared of The Wizard of Oz.
2109299	2110920	Wait a minute, you were scared of The Wizard of Oz?
2111341	2111541	Why?
2112452	2113933	The little mumpins.
2115394	2118596	The monkeys that fly on the... The monkeys that fly out of their ass?
2119077	2121538	No, it's the lollipop kids.
2122459	2123219	The munchkins.
2123299	2126582	Did you ever see the great sequel Return to Oz?
2127622	2128683	With the thing on the wheels?
2129484	2131005	No, you're thinking of the whiz.
2132385	2134326	No, Return to Oz was good.
2135027	2138768	The reason why Return to Oz was good is because it was actually based off of the book.
2138989	2140869	Yes, and Farooza Balk was in it, and she's cool.
2141150	2146112	The Wizard of Oz was not true to the book, because she went and met all of the witches.
2147513	2153796	She met the Good Witch of the North, the Good Witch of the South, killed one of them, and then killed the other.
2154576	2156417	So there was no balance, and Oz fell into ruin.
2158638	2159979	I remember the freakiest scene in Return to Oz.
2159999	2161700	There's all the little heads in the jar.
2162509	2163309	That was so cool.
2163509	2164190	That was awesome.
2164470	2165430	Oh, I'm sorry, but Monty, what?
2165930	2166170	Huh?
2166590	2167111	But Monty, what?
2167771	2169671	This is Random Night on Orange Lounge.
2169872	2170712	You heard it here first.
2170732	2171872	Oh, you know something we brought up earlier?
2172032	2172813	Oh, ass!
2173093	2173653	No, not ass.
2173953	2177894	It's not but Monty related exactly, but it's still pretty cool.
2178334	2180055	Initial D. Rob is staring at me.
2182696	2183436	Sorry, listeners.
2183916	2186977	Yes, Initial D, Mad Eurobeat.
2187878	2188418	I'm fatty.
2188618	2188978	I'm fatty.
2189138	2189798	Please explain.
2190519	2191219	I'm just fat.
2192265	2193786	Like Fat with a P or Fat with an F?
2193806	2194687	No, Fat with Fat.
2195647	2199650	And Orange Beanie has my SNIS one that I messed up on.
2199850	2203612	Explain for those who may not know about Initial D, what makes it so special?
2203652	2204973	Mad European action!
2205514	2205734	And?
2206254	2206854	Cars!
2207835	2208035	And?
2208636	2209656	And bad animation.
2210076	2210677	And the cards!
2210697	2211737	It's all about the little cards!
2211757	2212898	And shitty storyline!
2213939	2214659	And, and...
2218235	2219456	And yeah, neat cars.
2219536	2220017	I have one.
2220117	2221278	And I have my Trueno.
2223040	2223860	But you know what?
2223920	2225602	I'm not going to fucking get that spoiler.
2225782	2226863	That spoiler looks like shit.
2227664	2230767	And I know I can pass the option of upgrading my car.
2231487	2233449	Wow, your name really is Fatty.
2236792	2239875	See, I'm lucky enough to have a four-letter handle online, so I never have...
2242751	2259846	Alright, whoever of our listeners who was not there the night that I made my car, if you can guess the name that's on my card, for the card that I'm using right now, I will give you a memory card.
2260207	2260547	I don't know.
2260707	2261308	Memory card.
2261708	2262649	For what system?
2263009	2264190	For a PS2.
2265071	2265972	Not for a PS2, for a PlayStation.
2265992	2266052	PS1.
2268152	2270493	You win a DarkSakura autographed memory card.
2270513	2273174	You win a DarkSakura autographed memory card.
2273234	2274234	Here's your first clue.
2275234	2277395	It's R. You get two clues.
2278295	2280636	And they're pretty easy clues if you know how to find it.
2280776	2282597	The password is... Shut up.
2284657	2287018	The first clue is that the word is Greek.
2288178	2290820	Ah, now wait a minute, didn't they ban video games in Greece?
2291280	2291740	Fuck Greece.
2292861	2293922	By the way, they overruled that.
2294742	2297784	Second rule is that it means goal.
2300746	2302767	Goal!
2303007	2303507	Like soccer?
2303647	2305969	Yeah, or like, you know, a goal.
2306369	2307710	Like, you know, because you've got to have goals.
2308755	2315000	I gotta believe!
2315301	2323027	So whoever can guess what the word is, who was not there the night I made it, will win a DarkSakura autographed PlayStation memory card.
2324128	2325209	Or you'll win an orange bat.
2326550	2327891	A DarkSakura autographed orange bat.
2328732	2331114	And if it's the bat, I'll autograph it too, because the bat's big enough.
2331254	2332795	I can't autograph a memory card, but I can autograph a bat.
2332815	2333356	You can autograph the back.
2335470	2337812	I have a question that actually involves Bimani.
2338092	2339673	Oh my gosh, please do share.
2339893	2341094	Initial D. No.
2341955	2343075	No, tonight's initial D night.
2343416	2344076	Oh, okay.
2344116	2345617	Alright, ask your question.
2345998	2346198	Okay.
2346518	2349960	Yes, Ohi, Ohi who needs a shovel for the trouble he's getting in on this show.
2350581	2354924	Okay, because like Max 2 is coming out for PS2, right?
2355244	2356745	Psst, eventually.
2356905	2360988	Well, yeah, but PS2 memo cards don't work on the machine.
2361008	2361909	Oh, okay, good.
2362229	2362449	Oh, yes.
2365741	2366461	Here he comes.
2367682	2370223	Alright, this is just like DDR Max, okay?
2370523	2378287	What it does is you can save onto your PlayStation 2 memory card, then it has a library option where you can export edits onto memory cards for the PlayStation 1.
2379307	2380488	So that's how it works.
2380528	2385390	It actually converts them to PS1 format, then you go into your memory on your system and move it over.
2385770	2386270	More or less, yeah.
2386971	2387931	Let's play a new game.
2388331	2389192	You remember...
2390847	2392569	Do you remember Loki's edit contest?
2392589	2394290	How I had the edit to Somewhere Over the Rainbow?
2394450	2395911	Yes, the one that I got second place in.
2396251	2397432	You just held my hand.
2397993	2399734	Remember, you're in deep shit with me right now.
2400895	2401535	And me now.
2401555	2402796	Yes.
2403957	2404938	You died tonight.
2407379	2407720	I'm sorry?
2408560	2411202	I got some weird name edits tonight for people to play.
2411562	2412963	I've got a sexer me.
2414645	2416186	I've got a... Okay, okay.
2418326	2420788	Okay, Sex or Me, it's for gimme, gimme, gimme.
2421289	2426714	I've got, uh, I've got Pink Taco, I can't remember what that's for.
2426794	2427194	Lovely.
2427534	2428856	Uh, wouldn't it be Pink Dinosaur?
2429396	2432018	No, it's Pink Taco, it has nothing to do- No, I mean, it wouldn't be Dinosaur?
2432459	2432859	No.
2433540	2433900	No.
2434961	2440566	Um, I've got, uh, I've got one for Shake Your Booty, it's called Shake That Ass.
2440886	2441347	Yay!
2442148	2442728	Um, I've got-
2444322	2448683	I've got one... You know you look good when you back that ass up.
2448703	2450883	No, no, no, no, no.
2450903	2452764	I've got one that's called Ass Fire.
2456584	2457925	What'd you do, eat at Del Taco?
2459865	2464526	No, but the song is pretty hard and... Ah, shit.
2465046	2465486	I don't know.
2466246	2468546	I got some really fun... As JB goes off to play Jenny Rom.
2469607	2471167	Okay, I'm turning this over to you because I feel sick.
2472737	2474260	No, wait, you had a game you wanted to play, Jamie?
2474661	2478048	When we come back from the break, we should play Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.
2480032	2481195	It's in my ass.
2481736	2482578	No, we're not going to play.
2482598	2483139	A pickle!
2485026	2486667	This is not the Anna Nicole Smith show, come on.
2486687	2492449	When we come back from break, we are going to play Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.
2492729	2496111	And we are going to have an interview with Jer.
2496151	2496911	I'll think of something.
2496931	2499012	After break, an interview with Tajer.
2500513	2500793	No.
2501133	2504234	Whoever wins will get an autographed Propel bottle from me.
2505055	2506015	After I'm done drinking it.
2507055	2508136	And backwashing a lot.
2511431	2513832	You drink like, what, 44 ounces of soda?
2513852	2514252	That's right.
2514272	2516253	That's why I feel sick.
2516273	2517013	They can't hear you.
2518294	2521755	I said I'd be willing to urinate in the bottle, too, if that would increase the value of it.
2521815	2522595	How nice of you.
2522655	2523856	That's so kind and generous.
2523916	2524256	Thank you.
2524516	2525696	You're such a giving person.
2526057	2526737	We appreciate that.
2526797	2527537	Thank you, Loki.
2528537	2531278	So, well, it's break time because people have to pee.
2531559	2537841	All right, so we're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back after some of this very fine music here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2538121	2539482	Episode 15 and a half.
2539542	2540562	We're pre-taped tonight.
2541877	2542779	We're not pre-taped yet.
2543099	2543721	We're still taping.
2544141	2546225	Well, I mean, when they hear it, it's going to be pre-taped.
2546245	2546726	Oh, forget it!
2547027	2547548	Paradox!
2547608	2548109	Paradox!
2548830	2550013	I can sing the music on the break.
2550173	2551636	Alright, we're going to break now.
2551676	2551916	Cut!
2584821	2586825	Thank you for watching!
2672418	2672951	I don't know what I'm
2727352	2730018	I may be a little drunk, I mean tipsy
2954369	2955470	Hey, we're back from break.
2955770	2957231	Yes, we're Brack.
2957751	2958271	We're Brack?
2958551	2959192	Not Brack.
2959212	2959852	I love Brack.
2960272	2961193	I don't even, what is Brack?
2961213	2962193	I don't even know what I just said.
2963394	2965675	Brack is from Space Ghost Coast to Coast.
2965795	2967096	He is me.
2967456	2968957	He's crazy and stupid.
2970118	2970898	You're Brack?
2971018	2971418	Yes, I'm Brack.
2971438	2972739	Hi, my name is Brack.
2972999	2974920	Hi, my name is Bingo.
2975480	2976861	I like to climb on things.
2976901	2977702	Can I have a banana?
2977722	2978382	Eek, eek.
2978762	2980483	I got an F. It's eek, eek.
2980583	2981344	No, it's eek, eek.
2981384	2982544	I went over to Brittany's house.
2983165	2983525	Remember?
2984318	2985679	There's so much fighting here.
2985739	2987261	I can't... I can't... Hey, new game.
2987281	2987561	No, there isn't.
2987581	2989763	We're going to play... We're going to play a game.
2990503	2993306	Oh, I have to... I have to say, though, during the break, we lost to JB.
2993806	2995227	So... But we gained to Brad.
2995628	2995988	Yay.
2996048	2996568	So... Hi, Brad.
2996588	2997689	Welcome, Brad.
2998170	2998510	Oh, yes.
2999571	3001412	Where... What is this microphone in my face for?
3001873	3003174	Dude, they're playing Eat You Up.
3003334	3007177	And I wanted... I wanted to interview Jer, but he's shy, so... He's playing Eat You Up.
3007457	3008378	No, he's sitting right there.
3008418	3008999	He's just shy.
3009519	3009659	Oh.
3010400	3011321	Everybody make faces.
3015256	3016077	Totally oblivious.
3016097	3016477	This is great.
3016497	3017758	So we're going to play a game.
3017778	3018779	Yes, we're going to play a game.
3019019	3021100	It's called Guess What's in DarkSakura's Purse.
3022141	3022982	What's in my pants?
3023222	3023482	Oh, wait.
3023502	3024223	What's in my purse?
3024243	3025724	Because I'm being random.
3026544	3028145	And no, you can't guess what's on my purse.
3028246	3030007	How do we play What's in Jamie's Purse?
3030287	3031468	You guess what's in my purse.
3032469	3035871	You have to name an item that is in my purse.
3035911	3038673	And how is this related to Bimani?
3038693	3040595	Because I do have some Bimani stuff in my purse.
3040615	3040995	Okay, okay.
3041991	3042311	I know.
3042612	3044212	I'm going to guess.
3044472	3045753	First guess goes to Brad.
3046413	3047194	Rob's junk.
3049295	3051236	Is my junk in your purse?
3051536	3053277	There's nothing that belongs to Rob in my purse.
3055598	3057359	Alright, who wants to venture another guess?
3057999	3058739	Yes, Derek.
3059080	3059360	Money.
3060500	3062221	Ah, is there money in Jamie's purse?
3063382	3065343	I do not have any loose money in my purse.
3066063	3068704	I didn't say you didn't have money at all.
3068784	3069545	I do have money.
3069905	3070225	Oh, thank you.
3071095	3071596	We do have money.
3071656	3071916	Okay.
3072296	3072636	Next.
3072696	3072997	I'll go.
3075339	3076119	Provolactics.
3078782	3079062	No.
3080844	3083106	Jamie, you need to be prepared.
3083126	3083966	You never know when.
3085087	3085988	I'm always prepared.
3086108	3087930	I don't need tools.
3088791	3089271	Next.
3090272	3091233	Oh, wait.
3091293	3092294	We should have asked the employee.
3092314	3094155	What's in my purse?
3095096	3095617	A pen.
3096257	3096838	Oh, a pen.
3097058	3098099	Is there a pen in your purse?
3100114	3101695	For extra points, guess what colors?
3105299	3106440	Blue and black.
3108521	3114927	Black, red, purple, green, greenish.
3114947	3118310	The blue pen in my purse is actually missing, but I have a gold one.
3119270	3121411	Well, you know, if you mix some of these colors together, you might get blue.
3121991	3125732	I did have... Barf is not a color.
3126552	3128132	Barf always has a distinct color.
3128332	3129673	Bradley, what's in my purse?
3131453	3133253	I'll guess some sort of tissues.
3134714	3136054	I once barfed blue Kool-Aid.
3136074	3136874	I'm not shitting you.
3136934	3138535	I do not have any tissues in my purse.
3140395	3142536	Oh, no tissues.
3142656	3144796	Trainwreck Radio, is that in your purse?
3146437	3147717	No, there's no Trainwreck in my purse.
3150268	3152329	Some sort of video game promotional item.
3153429	3154450	Video game promo item.
3154570	3156450	That could be a token.
3156570	3157751	I have a GameCube lanyard.
3158231	3161372	I have a Game Boy Advance thingy.
3162333	3162733	A thingy?
3163133	3164173	Is that the technical name for it?
3164313	3166754	It's a keychain.
3166774	3170396	This game's not working if you sit there with your purse open for us all to look in.
3173077	3175778	And I had a GameCube pen in here once.
3176610	3177670	Okay, let's see.
3178711	3179751	Everybody gets one more guess.
3179871	3180552	One more guess.
3180572	3181472	What's in my purse?
3183613	3184053	Let's see.
3184713	3186354	Something to do with Happy Bunny.
3187454	3188655	You know this because you bought it.
3190476	3192076	It's my Happy Bunny token case.
3192136	3193337	It says I hate everything.
3193557	3194938	Happy Bunny kicks ass.
3195138	3195818	I love Happy Bunny.
3195838	3196478	What's in my purse?
3198759	3199880	Shut up and tell me what's in my purse.
3201400	3203361	Damn.
3204662	3205482	A planner book.
3207492	3208433	Dude, I have two of those.
3208913	3211255	Oh, double points.
3211415	3212436	A Batsmaroo planner.
3215939	3221604	I have a... Oh, dude, I found another pen.
3223066	3224627	I have a Nyago address book.
3225228	3226529	It's a little smushed kitty.
3226549	3229531	A smushed kitty.
3230252	3230792	Next.
3232314	3232414	Air.
3234083	3237025	Guess a physical item that is not like loose particles.
3237465	3238165	And not in your head.
3238926	3239046	Oh.
3239786	3240186	Meanie.
3240866	3241327	Smack him.
3244448	3245008	A notepad.
3249050	3250991	Honestly, there is not a notepad in my purse.
3251151	3252252	I took it out this morning.
3252972	3254993	No, I took it out when I wrote the rules to freestyle.
3256534	3257234	Okay, Bradley.
3257875	3258195	Bradley.
3260216	3262337	Uh, candy bar.
3263132	3263672	Candy Bar.
3266814	3267915	If you have a candy bar, we win it.
3269216	3270256	No, she has to add an autograph.
3270276	3271217	She has to autograph it first.
3271977	3274459	Tootsie Roll, I'll be damned.
3274619	3275079	Does that count?
3275439	3275699	Yeah.
3276040	3278981	It's not really a bar, it's cylindrical, but it's kind of smushed, so now it's a bar.
3280182	3281062	Okay.
3281423	3282323	Last up, Loki.
3282483	3283144	Nat hasn't guessed.
3283284	3285625	Loki, we're playing Guess What's in Jamie's Purse.
3286966	3289547	You have to come over here and talk into the mic.
3289587	3290588	I don't care how tired you are.
3291344	3309928	and of course it has everything to do with demonic okay uh chapstick oh chapstick no it's in my pocket what happens if you get chapped lips i said it's in my pocket oh it's in your pocket oh okay what happens so here is what's

3312749	3313049	Okay.
3313610	3314631	I have a cell phone.
3315211	3316613	Oh, I knew that.
3316693	3317774	It's like playing Family Feud.
3317994	3318995	Number one answer.
3320817	3321557	Penguin mints.
3322498	3323779	Good answer, good answer.
3324160	3326061	Now I'm in my second guess, okay?
3326582	3327162	Chopsticks.
3328343	3328884	Sunglasses.
3328904	3329064	Vicodin.
3332558	3333801	Yes, I have bike it in my purse.
3334683	3336266	A wallet.
3336286	3338771	Bike it in!
3340054	3341877	That was the worst joke ever told on this show.
3341917	3342278	I love it.
3343779	3346221	He said, no, Chopstick isn't da-da-da-da-da-da.
3346241	3349283	Chopstick is dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
3349303	3350504	This is a special camera.
3350964	3352565	What's so special about it?
3352585	3356668	The camera from the DDR Freak moderator strip in Vegas that needs to be developed.
3357849	3362792	Is there any scandalous sex stream pictures on there?
3362912	3363533	Drunk people.
3364934	3366215	Extremely blackmailing.
3368422	3370463	Give me my thingies!
3372043	3372604	RC Country.
3372744	3379667	Now you've got games like Matt Hoffman's Triple X, or was it Triple X BMX or whatever they're like that?
3380628	3382269	Or BMX Triple X or something like that?
3382529	3386351	You wonder if they're going to ever come out with like, I don't know, an X-rated version of DDR.
3386371	3389412	DDR Gal's Panic Mix.
3395658	3396358	That would be wrong.
3397018	3397919	That would be involving me.
3397939	3398999	What was that one game?
3400199	3401280	Oh, God, there's this game.
3402060	3403480	What is that game that you play?
3403600	3408602	It's just like Kix, and you're drawing the picture, and you get the naked lady, but if you... Scouts Panic.
3408622	3409142	Is that Scouts?
3409502	3409982	That's Scouts Panic.
3410202	3417664	But there's another one where it flips around, and at certain times you'll get the evil picture, the demon, and there's this techno music that plays.
3417704	3419445	It goes, Everybody run!
3419725	3420845	It's really funny.
3421965	3422726	I don't know.
3422766	3423106	Okay, hi.
3425484	3426525	I enjoyed that joke, Rob.
3426805	3431789	I may be the only person here who did, but... Probably the only person on all of the internet that enjoyed that joke, but that's alright.
3432369	3433870	My back hurts.
3433890	3439694	This is not like what they were claiming to be the funniest joke.
3442016	3444137	I hear candy!
3444217	3445498	This is a quaint little party room.
3445759	3445999	Tell...
3449781	3451702	Tell us about Shaft.
3451862	3452962	Any new updates on Shaft?
3453423	3454103	Shut your mouth!
3454123	3455664	Jamie, tell us what you know about Shaft.
3456704	3458865	Shaft's one bad mother... Shut your mouth!
3459345	3460506	I'm just talking about Shaft!
3460986	3461666	We can dig it.
3464508	3465788	That joke will be over you.
3465928	3468289	Well, it's already, but... I can tell you about Shaft.
3468349	3469090	It's gonna be big.
3469670	3469850	Big.
3469910	3471831	Big and far!
3471871	3474012	Hopefully it won't run too long.
3475974	3478435	To quote Ultra Magnus, it's big.
3478875	3479715	Bigger than the Matrix.
3483036	3484197	Ultra Transformers.
3485077	3486657	Yes, Transformers are owned.
3487278	3492279	Anyway, Shaft, November 9th for all you people who are coming from everywhere.
3492559	3493700	Dude, we're having people fly here.
3493740	3494240	That's awesome.
3497205	3498727	How cartoonish of you.
3498767	3499487	What?
3499828	3500749	What'd you say?
3500809	3501509	What'd you say?
3502310	3508516	Anyway, like I was saying, we're going to try to get things started as soon as possible.
3508977	3511259	That morning we're going to have an official time release on the site soon.
3511980	3517746	For people who are wanting to see it, just go to sakbemani.com and click on the link to Shaft on the main bar.
3518306	3522507	Click on Jamie Schaft and you'll see all about... You can shut up about that already.
3524008	3526668	No, you're... But we like... You remember, you were in deep shit.
3526708	3531030	Now you're in, like, boiling diarrhea.
3531550	3531970	Okay.
3532490	3532890	Milk.
3533750	3534471	Oh, my God.
3534531	3535831	Lactose intolerance much?
3536611	3537631	I'm allergic to it, too.
3538072	3538552	I don't care.
3538652	3543093	Anyway... We're trying to promote Schaft here, not have people run away screaming, holding their...
3543550	3544070	Mr. T, I pity the fool!
3564361	3566583	Hey, and remember, Mr. T supports Shaft.
3566603	3568224	He pities the foo who don't go to Shaft.
3569165	3571286	He's on the site with his orange afro.
3571386	3571767	You know what?
3572147	3573368	Maybe you ought to ask an incentive.
3573688	3576470	An extra tenth of a point to anyone who dresses up.
3577171	3583956	Alright, people will get an extra tenth of a percentile point added if they have the following items.
3584276	3588779	They dress up like an A-Team member or they wear an orange afro.
3589680	3589940	Okay.
3590661	3591181	Only orange?
3591541	3592022	Only orange?
3592742	3593443	Stand by to win.
3593973	3594233	Wow.
3595594	3595835	No.
3595855	3596415	What about red?
3597256	3597496	Orange.
3597996	3598297	Why?
3598937	3600379	Because it's the Wow Wow 70s.
3600499	3602500	And Orange Lounge is sponsoring the tournament.
3603962	3608105	Or, you know, if you wear a little, you know, French girly dress and push a shopping cart around.
3608786	3609406	I'll wear a dress.
3609526	3610207	I'll wear a dress.
3610587	3610767	No.
3611088	3612849	Anyway.
3613009	3614471	Oh, people named Eric are disqualified.
3614511	3614731	Sorry.
3615411	3616572	I'm just kidding.
3616672	3618014	I'm just kidding.
3618034	3621276	We're talking about 18 Freestyle.
3621296	3621657	Hello.
3621677	3621777	Hello.
3625468	3630191	It's still recording.
3630211	3631051	Is it?
3631111	3631471	Here, here.
3631672	3633573	How's it recording?
3634733	3635114	Okay.
3635494	3639316	And we dropped the microphone, the player thingy, fucking thing.
3639836	3640577	Dead air, dead air.
3640597	3641197	Back to Shaft.
3643078	3648583	You know, you didn't think you could fuck up this show with two microphones and a tape recorder, but, you know, anything's possible.
3648983	3652446	You need to have that, like, stand by.
3652466	3654787	We're experiencing technical difficulties.
3656809	3658650	I'll just loop stand by to win.
3658971	3659131	Wow.
3661093	3662013	Okay, we're back from the break.
3662273	3663934	Anyway, yes.
3664574	3667314	But no, the A-Team rules should be posted.
3667374	3672355	Just to go ahead and give people an idea, though, we are putting the bars back on the machine for A-Team Freestyle.
3672635	3673255	Of course, you have to.
3673275	3678036	And in the interest of being old school, the A-Team Freestyle, we're thinking, is going to be on the fourth mix.
3678156	3680136	It's not going to be the regular bar, it's going to be my bar.
3682137	3682617	A.K.A.
3682637	3683297	your shaft?
3684517	3686037	You are encouraged to rape the bar.
3687378	3687918	No!
3688038	3688938	You are encouraged...
3690291	3696736	2 Knee Drop, Hand Plant, but we ask, we ask, please no Matrix Walking.
3697697	3699218	Actually, we demand it because, you know.
3699419	3702621	And we encourage getting bloody knees on the screws, Jamie style.
3703062	3704663	Dude, I still have the scar.
3704683	3707565	What about my famous butt drop?
3707966	3708746	You can do the butt drop.
3708786	3709507	You can do the butt drop.
3710207	3711128	I'm not going to be there, though.
3711608	3712009	Why not?
3712709	3712950	Bitch.
3713010	3713350	You suck.
3715307	3716127	Get the day off!
3717508	3719689	You know what's funny?
3720350	3721530	I ran into Derek at work the other day.
3721550	3722251	I went through his line.
3723591	3725192	Just completely random.
3726333	3726873	At Targay.
3726893	3727933	You work at Targay.
3728994	3731335	Actually, I'm an only straight cashier.
3732236	3732756	I knew it.
3732856	3733756	I've been there before.
3733917	3734457	My God.
3734737	3738599	Some of the guys that work there are just... They had to be selling firewood.
3738719	3740720	Anyway...
3745638	3746298	Oh yeah, hi.
3747959	3752421	Just, you know, going from one topic to the other, you know, the gay cashiers at Target to Shaft.
3752501	3752761	Alright.
3755061	3760904	Basically, just to go ahead and give a brief recap, we're going to have freestyle on both machines.
3761504	3765965	So, for all of you people who are listening on Sunday in the future for us in the current day for you.
3768027	3780871	We are going to be running fourth mix freestyle first, so make sure that you decide on your song at registration or pre-registration so that we can make sure that we have the machine set up for you.
3781352	3787394	You know, there's going to be no changing your mind once we get to the machine unless the song happens to be in that machine.
3787414	3788174	You lay down the law.
3789134	3791715	Damn straight, or damn gay.
3792395	3793636	One of them two.
3796187	3797688	One other thing we should talk about Shaft.
3798168	3801029	We're going to have door prizes out the ass at Shaft.
3801049	3804651	And a lot of that's going to be thanks to the big Shaft right here.
3805291	3805931	Matt himself.
3806191	3809213	Tell us about some of the lovely door prizes people can expect to see at Shaft.
3810093	3814435	You can expect to see a whole bunch of DVDs provided by ADV Films.
3815616	3819497	Yes, lots of DVDs to be had.
3820138	3821538	Lots and lots of DVDs.
3821958	3823299	Are you bribing people to come here?
3824184	3826526	No, but there will be lots and lots of DVDs.
3826986	3828527	Lots and lots and lots.
3829267	3834251	Now what about tapes for those people living in the Dark Age still?
3834311	3835371	Lots of DVDs.
3835731	3838573	I suppose I could provide some tapes.
3839454	3840234	I think we can do that.
3840795	3842336	But you shouldn't be living in the Dark Ages.
3842796	3843256	Come out.
3844137	3845278	I don't want a LaserDisc.
3845758	3846859	Come out and get some Shaft.
3848520	3849620	Come to Shaft.
3850681	3851802	Mr. T ate my balls.
3853390	3853670	Dun dun dun!
3878797	3879638	We know what the prize is.
3879918	3880579	Shut up.
3881340	3881640	Oh, yeah.
3881860	3882280	Oh, yes.
3882361	3882661	Uh-huh.
3882881	3884122	Big, big prizes.
3884403	3885103	You're going to want them.
3885363	3889808	We are also going to be having a demonstration the day of tournament.
3889848	3891449	Are these door prizes?
3892210	3893832	These are actual winning prizes.
3894592	3894893	Damn it.
3895573	3895894	Damn it.
3896614	3897655	Damn it, damn it, damn it.
3897915	3898276	I want you.
3899042	3899763	I want door prizes.
3899783	3900843	He's not providing door prizes.
3900863	3905147	But we are going to also be having a special secret demo that day.
3905207	3908930	There's going to be a special demo set up of something secret.
3909330	3909590	Yes.
3910691	3912112	Something super.
3912733	3913593	Something extreme.
3914834	3915295	Shut up.
3916475	3918037	No, we're not telling, so don't even guess.
3920803	3922163	Oh, I wasn't going to guess.
3923124	3928265	I was going to say about that new DDR, if you notice the logo, it's spelled ErkStream.
3929085	3930185	Not X-Stream.
3930365	3932166	The R is before the X. Look at the logo.
3932186	3933246	DDR ErkStream.
3933666	3934966	Actually, yeah, it is the prescription symbol.
3934986	3935967	The R and the X cross.
3936327	3937187	It's a drug game.
3937207	3938707	They're promoting drug usage.
3939127	3939587	Oh, shit.
3940328	3942248	They're promoting drug usage.
3942288	3943768	They're promoting just the Ray Bars.
3943828	3945329	Am I by a bathroom because it smells like shit?
3945409	3945789	Look at this.
3946089	3946829	It's a clown door.
3946869	3947629	It's a little penny door.
3947809	3950130	Okay, train wreck radio.
3953186	3954007	That was a car.
3954407	3955187	Back to Shaft.
3955688	3956308	Shut your mouth.
3956528	3957609	Oh, I feel so good, Jamie.
3957649	3958129	I'm sorry.
3960431	3961431	Anyway, back to Shaft.
3963032	3970517	We are also planning, assuming that I can find one, we are having special trophies for our A-Team Freestyle winners.
3974159	3976241	We are going to have, as a trophy...
3977543	3978223	Secret prizes.
3978643	3989627	Well, we could, you know, I mean, I'm sure I'll be able to provide, like, you know, bronze replicas of certain things if you need for that.
3990647	3993088	What kind of job are you running on the side, Loki?
3995068	3996789	We give him a gold picture of Samuel.
3999549	4000910	I hate Orange Lounge Radio.
4000970	4002450	All they ever do is tell potty jokes.
4003771	4004451	Pencils rage!
4006585	4011573	Anyway, so all of you have to come to Shaft or I'll hunt you down and kick your ass.
4012414	4014698	You remember, I know where you live, I saw it on the internet.
4018484	4021088	Let's change gears completely, if you don't turn your ass, Shaft.
4022071	4024413	I want to talk about another game I just got to play for the first time.
4024493	4027995	Initial D. No, not Initial D. Drum Mania 7th Mix.
4028456	4029776	It's not broken.
4030197	4031478	But Guitar Freaks 8th Mix is.
4032338	4032659	Ew.
4033279	4036241	And here's our other universal, fuck you to Roseville, Goughlin.
4036701	4037402	Bite our ass.
4037862	4038363	It's fun.
4040404	4042806	Was there anything that you enjoyed about Drum Mania 7th Mix?
4043406	4046949	I enjoyed playing Another World, but I hated that it wasn't Gak singing it.
4048650	4050311	I'm glad I can actually pass a song now.
4051091	4051752	Breakdown owned me.
4053181	4054262	The video to break down rules.
4054682	4055502	It's a little girl.
4056403	4057143	It's so cute.
4057503	4060664	It's like, well, think about the How to Spring video where you had a little panda.
4060844	4061565	That was cool, too.
4062225	4063165	Pandas are cool.
4063185	4067447	Hey, well, you know, all the girls doing... That's not cool?
4068328	4068768	What's wrong with you?
4070626	4072647	They did put in a new panda song in there, though.
4073448	4075189	There's the one that's got the heart in the front and the back.
4075209	4075829	I don't know what it says.
4075849	4076450	Do you know the name of it?
4077070	4077890	Bradley doesn't know the name of it.
4077950	4078371	Nobody does.
4079531	4085315	It's got a girl riding on a silver surfer board type thing, and there's two pandas flying with her.
4085675	4086155	It's pretty neat.
4086796	4088136	Silver surfer was cool.
4088677	4089037	What?
4090098	4090458	Nerd.
4091058	4092679	You said the silver surfboard.
4092759	4093139	Nerd.
4093680	4093980	So?
4094340	4094660	Nerd.
4095020	4095341	So?
4095541	4095861	Nerd.
4096101	4096421	So?
4096561	4096861	Dork.
4097082	4097402	So?
4097422	4097502	Dork.
4098564	4100705	This is great radio, ladies and gentlemen.
4101845	4102805	I hate Orange Lounge radio.
4102845	4103666	All they ever do is fight.
4104266	4107727	Dear Diary, I listened to this show today called Orange Lounge.
4108107	4109827	First of all, I hate Orange Lounge.
4109847	4111688	Those little girls are stealing all my fender.
4112228	4118530	Oh, wait, that's the radio show and not the... Dear Diary, today I got a new hairdo.
4120931	4121691	Uh-oh.
4122111	4123171	Dear Diary, kill me now.
4123291	4123572	Oh, yes.
4124632	4128093	Totally off the topic here, but on the fourth mix...
4129060	4131262	Um, Felatio, it almost owned me.
4131962	4133163	Felatio?
4133644	4135385	Felatio almost owned me there.
4135505	4137366	Everybody owns me.
4137747	4138807	Felatio, what?
4140048	4141569	But I kicked Pink Taco's ass.
4142490	4143951	Well, Felatio always owns me.
4145452	4147434	Yeah.
4147454	4148454	What do you think about that?
4149615	4150076	I think.
4151016	4151437	I feel.
4154299	4154999	Um, you know what?
4162203	4162883	It's gonna be me.
4162963	4164004	I'm gonna get hit.
4164925	4168507	My idea of what can make this show better, let's all get drunk and then do it.
4169368	4171770	We're actually planning a drunk show.
4172390	4175412	Whenever the next three-day weekend is, we're doing the drunk show.
4175532	4177674	I don't know when that is for Jamie and I when we both have a holiday.
4177714	4178414	We'll find one.
4178814	4180135	We'll make one if we have to.
4183177	4184318	We're getting eggnog.
4184398	4186580	It's eggnog radio.
4186600	4189362	I'm allergic to that too because it's got dairy crap in it.
4189442	4191243	Well, then you can just drink tequila.
4191844	4192484	I used to do that.
4192544	4193325	I haven't drank in six months.
4193345	4194826	We'll give you a whiskey enema.
4195347	4196227	I drank last night.
4196327	4198809	I had Red Bull.
4199590	4200670	I'm not an alcoholic.
4200710	4203252	No, Red Bull mixed with Malibu is really good.
4203372	4204173	That sounds gross.
4204453	4204974	Red Bull is nasty.
4204994	4205914	They call it a pebble.
4207035	4209317	It was pebbles or pebble.
4210305	4212066	I don't know, a dyke made it, so it might have been Pebbles.
4212346	4213807	I think you were just too drunk to know.
4214427	4221830	By the way, Red Bull, if you pour it into a clear glass, it is the color of urine.
4223951	4226312	One of my friends says that Red Bull smells like pussy.
4226372	4226892	What do you think?
4228113	4232094	Well, first of all, I don't bend over to smell my own, you know.
4232915	4235296	If pussy smelled that good, I'd eat it every day.
4236276	4237437	I'm gonna need a pussy bag.
4237517	4237797	I do.
4241218	4243360	To quote Rob, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
4246463	4246723	Well.
4252569	4254610	I can just go around going cock, cock, cock, cock.
4255972	4257053	Can you say the C-bomb on here?
4257573	4257853	Yeah.
4257893	4258214	Cunt.
4258654	4259175	Cunt.
4263720	4264401	This is adult content.
4264421	4265121	This is adult content.
4287560	4288320	Recess?
4288380	4289661	I thought recess was like 6, right?
4289681	4291342	I never said fucking when I was like 6.
4291522	4293723	It's bathroom humor.
4294003	4295884	Orange Lounge Radio, we cater to 7 year olds.
4296945	4297285	Poopy!
4297665	4298406	Freak Poopy!
4300267	4301047	Doggy Doo!
4301687	4303148	Let's hear it for the DDR free filters.
4304249	4304549	What?
4305149	4306430	The most fun filters in the world.
4307222	4309164	We have more candy.
4309604	4310125	Yay!
4310245	4311586	Everybody dance!
4312327	4313548	This is fun!
4316530	4318572	No, they can't see us dance on the radio.
4319973	4321475	My anus is bleeding!
4322195	4323597	For the love of God!
4323897	4325458	My anus is bleeding!
4325779	4328701	My anus is bleeding!
4330795	4334539	Did I mention these tape shows tend to get a little too weird?
4335220	4338503	Just wanted to remind our listeners that as they're signing off.
4340525	4342386	We're still off topic, huh?
4342867	4345389	Bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money, bit money.
4345550	4346490	Okay, that makes sense.
4346510	4347732	Let's go.
4348192	4351055	How about 8th Style coming out this week, hitting some places finally?
4351856	4353077	Everything's off the damn boat.
4353855	4355376	Yeah, that's my FU of the week.
4355776	4362180	Fuck you to the longshoremen people who aren't working right now because we need stuff off a boat like our 8th style machine.
4362200	4362580	Bitches.
4362600	4364562	Why don't we just go do it ourselves?
4365022	4365662	Bitches.
4365982	4367383	You go and we'll be right behind you.
4367403	4370625	If I get a dolly, I'll push that bitch here.
4370685	4371446	Hey, I'm not working.
4371466	4372927	I'll ship that baby on in.
4374047	4375008	To your house, baby.
4375028	4375968	You'll guide it to shaft.
4379344	4384767	Actually, during the break, I was over kind of looking at the balloon blowing up machine where our 2DX machine's going to be.
4385548	4387229	Just admiring the space.
4388169	4390330	Did you start air playing?
4390571	4391431	No, I'm not that sick.
4391471	4391791	Jesus.
4393432	4394053	Yes, my child?
4394973	4395213	Where?
4396194	4396654	My trunk.
4397034	4397395	Right there.
4397435	4398315	Oh my god, it's Jesus.
4398855	4399376	Hi, Bradley.
4400536	4401957	Savior, you're here.
4404799	4405639	Damn, he's real.
4408696	4409956	I have a message for you.
4410477	4411378	You're going to hell.
4414140	4416421	We got a special place in for you in hell.
4417382	4419764	Remember, I'm taking over hell.
4421125	4424848	Yes, as heard in the intro to this very show.
4425488	4426729	My mother resides in hell.
4427670	4430672	No, I'm taking over hell.
4430952	4432773	I don't know.
4432834	4435375	What are you doing tomorrow?
4435395	4435816	Working.
4436556	4437177	How long do they have for you?
4438560	4440561	Um, what are we doing tomorrow?
4440721	4442282	We're having a shaft meeting.
4442302	4443643	We're going globaling Saturday.
4443863	4444883	Yeah, we're going to go global.
4446844	4448365	We're going to CCL to global.
4448745	4451306	Fuck CCL and their fucking racist bastards.
4453127	4455408	Well, apparently Derek has a fuck you of the week.
4455668	4459150	Just fuck CCL and their fucking racist people.
4459670	4460190	What happened?
4460991	4461071	Um...
4462680	4469405	One of the dudes told my friend he was a Nazi bastard, and then this big huge black guy told me to fuck myself.
4470086	4472748	Because I said that their machine took my coins.
4473068	4475871	He said, well, fuck you.
4476571	4477592	One of the police?
4477853	4478053	Yes.
4479059	4479259	Yeah.
4479279	4480720	So did you go tell the manager?
4480740	4481561	Yes, I reported it that night.
4482001	4485204	And he got suspended for like two, three weeks or something.
4485324	4485624	Good.
4485744	4487506	And then his fat ass is back again.
4487886	4490548	And now he's really nice to me and smiles and waves.
4491389	4491829	All right, then.
4491849	4493691	I bet he talks shit behind your back, though.
4494491	4495492	I think everybody does.
4495532	4496713	You guys probably do, too.
4497934	4498514	God, that guy.
4498534	4499015	Oh, my God.
4499055	4500796	I can't believe we let Fatty on the show tonight.
4502598	4503298	You're not that fat.
4503318	4504639	You never heard about my issue with CTO.
4504659	4505420	You're just big boned.
4506644	4507445	at CCL.
4507485	4510006	I thought you said Cecile.
4510046	4512127	You're not, you're not, Derek, you're not fat, you're husky.
4512527	4513128	I'm chunky.
4513668	4514048	No, no.
4514068	4514429	Chunk.
4514609	4515469	No, no, no, no, no.
4515669	4516230	I know.
4516590	4518971	No, I'll put an accent mark so it's chunky.
4519692	4520392	Well, remember.
4520452	4521212	Like Jack A on 227?
4523112	4526195	Oh my god, we're two people alive in the 80s?
4526235	4527156	He's a little boy.
4527176	4528337	I'm 19!
4528497	4529138	You're a little boy.
4529198	4533122	Don't you remember the show 227 on NBC?
4533342	4537706	It had the chick from Sesame Street and Jackie... Oh, Jesus Christ, forget it.
4538807	4541950	Anyway... You've really dated yourself, I'm sorry.

4575040	4575360	What?
4575501	4576621	Silverhawks is awesome.
4577481	4578982	Silverhawks.
4579382	4580303	Isn't that a football team?
4580703	4581583	No, that's a Seahawks.
4582764	4583764	No, it's not a football team.
4584104	4584545	Yeah, it is.
4584565	4585165	Seahawks is.

4586065	4586586	It's a show.
4586786	4589907	It's like, it's the same thing as Thundercats except they're silver and they're hawks.
4590247	4590887	And they're in space.

4602581	4603983	Weren't the 80s great?
4605325	4607248	Spider stomping power pads.
4607981	4608781	I was talking about the 80s.
4608841	4612483	I've been watching VH1 Classics this week.
4612703	4614183	VH1 Classic is the shit.
4614263	4615184	I love that station.
4615404	4618645	The We Are the 80s show is like the best thing ever.
4619345	4619565	Ever.
4619805	4621286	Dude, I saw the worst video on that.
4621486	4622326	The Shane O'Connor one?
4622346	4624907	The Shane O'Connor video, to put your hands on me.
4625187	4625468	You know what?
4625708	4626948	This is how the video goes.
4626988	4628309	Who'd want to put their hands on Shane O'Connor?
4628329	4631470	There's flowers in the background, and look, I'm Shane O'Connor, and I'm dancing.
4631550	4632650	Boy, I can't dance.
4632930	4634871	Hey, look, it's MC Lyte, and she's going to rap.
4635011	4635911	Hey, where'd MC Lyte go?
4635951	4636872	It's Shane O'Connor.
4637612	4638633	Hi, I'm Sinead O'Connor.
4638673	4640113	I'm a lesbian, but I just married a guy.
4641194	4642434	Wow.
4642834	4643555	What?
4643575	4646716	I actually saw the get up before the night is over video today.

4647917	4648577	Oh, Balani related.
4648637	4649077	Very nice.
4649097	4649477	Very nice.
4649497	4649798	Thank you.
4651018	4652639	Now, if we see the reflex on there.
4652899	4653659	By the way, this sucked.
4653739	4654200	It worked today.
4655040	4656961	I had nothing but Duran Duran songs stuck in my head.
4657601	4659882	I was sitting at my desk singing the reflex.
4660122	4663904	I didn't see the reflex, but I saw a view to a kill.
4664904	4666025	On the way here, I heard Rio.
4667255	4667756	Ooh.
4667776	4668056	Ooh.
4668537	4669417	Eighties after eight.
4669698	4671499	Hey, this is what I started.
4671519	4677585	I was sitting at my desk, and I started singing the reflex, and the girl, the temp who sits behind me, started singing it with me.
4678065	4682269	So we were both sitting at our desks singing the reflex while the rest of the office was looking at us.
4683790	4685011	I have to run outside real fast.
4685031	4685472	I'll be back.
4685532	4686513	You guys take over the show.
4687794	4688314	Take over.
4688755	4689776	Dun, dun, dun.
4689896	4690917	Dun, dun, dun.
4691337	4692018	Twinkle.
4694368	4694668	Anyway.
4694708	4700172	So, yeah, my name is Rob and... You don't sound gay enough.
4700252	4701833	Oh, sorry.
4702233	4703213	That's too gay.
4703914	4704214	Okay.
4705615	4706555	I'll just talk normal then.
4706676	4706936	Okay.
4707296	4707916	Hi, Brad.
4708176	4708397	Hi.
4708877	4709637	Shh, I'm Rob.
4711118	4711739	Okay, anyway.
4712279	4713900	So how's this stuff, this Propel water?
4714020	4714801	Propel owns me.
4715621	4716642	It tastes like ghetto Kool-Aid.
4716882	4717442	Ghetto Kool-Aid?
4717462	4719303	Like with too much sugar or too much water?
4719563	4720124	Too much sugar.
4722635	4727618	I did not mean to explode people's speakers.
4728158	4729679	I just looked out the window and there was Rob.
4731600	4732281	Rob is back.
4732621	4733361	Rob is coming.
4733682	4734282	Rob's coming.
4734302	4735143	Rob's coming.
4737884	4739185	I left my bag outside.
4739625	4741466	I wanted to get it before somebody stole it.
4742287	4743788	Because this isn't a nice neighborhood.
4744668	4747610	Dude, some guy proposed to me in this neighborhood.
4748306	4748647	Really?
4748947	4751490	I was walking to Scandia.
4751770	4752951	This was, you know, about a month ago.
4753652	4755714	And I was going to talk to Keith about things.
4756195	4758177	Or Kundagi, for people who know him online.
4758838	4760620	And this old guy comes out of this garden.
4761801	4768849	And he comes up to me and hands me a flower and says, You know, you...
4769634	4771035	A flower in the weed garden.
4773076	4774036	Do you need a husband?
4775077	4776037	I have one, thank you.
4776678	4779319	And I walked really fast.
4780299	4781600	You power walked your way out of that.
4781700	4783141	I power walked my way out of that.
4783441	4785362	Some dude tried to propose to me.
4785942	4786923	Okay, first of all.
4789744	4791625	Where, what neighborhood is this again?
4791905	4792345	Hello?
4793506	4797007	You know, I'm here, big honky girl in the middle of, you know.
4797027	4797968	Where are we?
4800501	4801341	Madison and Aidy.
4801901	4802842	This is Hillsdale.
4804523	4813608	I hate when my balls stick to the side of my leg.
4817170	4818170	I don't need to hear this.
4818630	4821172	They get sweaty.
4821692	4826315	Rob, I can't believe you missed Survivor to come to this show.
4826675	4828756	I'm not missing Survivor because I own a TiVo.
4829537	4830918	and those things are the shit.
4832578	4832758	No!
4836140	4838861	I swear to God, if you ruin it for me, I will never forgive you either.
4839621	4839901	Ever.
4840221	4840441	No.
4841422	4843222	I'm not listening, I'm not listening.
4843322	4845123	Hey, Mr. DJ.
4845143	4846904	Hey, Mr. DJ.
4848484	4849945	Only the Market Show fans would get that.
4851002	4855105	Who was here in Sacramento last week, by the way, but I missed it because I'm poor.
4855686	4858668	I'm so poor.
4858688	4859488	No, it's me.
4859649	4860229	I could have gone.
4861110	4862811	I'm poorer than you.
4862951	4864032	Let's play who's poorest.
4864372	4865713	Oh, whip it out, dude.
4866994	4867895	I don't want to see you.
4868095	4868455	Well, okay.
4868675	4870517	I don't want to see you whip it out.
4870577	4872178	No, whip out your wallet.
4872318	4872998	All right.
4874139	4874960	All right.
4875000	4875741	I owe money.
4875781	4876401	No change.
4877322	4877622	Oh, yeah?
4877682	4878362	No dollars.
4878963	4880324	In fact, I have bills to pay.
4881327	4884109	Oh, looks like somebody's not as poor as I am.
4884229	4885109	Okay, wait, wait.
4885569	4885849	I have $19.
4885930	4889291	You're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy.
4889391	4890412	Bradley, you're a boy?
4890492	4892273	Okay, Bradley has a source of income.
4892973	4893273	I don't.
4893673	4894994	He's a whore.
4895014	4896295	Bradley's really an international spy.
4896315	4897615	You have no money and no job?
4898076	4898396	Fuck.
4898616	4898936	I lose.
4901760	4902141	I like that.
4902421	4902961	I like that quote.
4903121	4904783	You mean you have no money and no job?
4904803	4905543	Fuck.
4905823	4907705	Brad wins an eagle, sir.
4907725	4909866	Brad wins a forest, yay.
4909886	4911387	He gets an autographed napkin.
4912708	4916271	Yes, you win a lovely autographed piece of fecal matter.
4916451	4917491	Someone give me a napkin.
4917952	4919473	No, I get evicted is what I get.
4923380	4925860	No, he won an autographed eviction notice by his landlord.
4929381	4930661	And now here's the prize.
4933942	4936022	Yes, Jamie's autographing this right now.
4936682	4938543	You got owned.
4940943	4943104	Dark Sakura.
4946324	4946905	By Dark Sakura.
4947325	4948445	And I'm going to sign it too.
4951524	4955508	Rob is writing something because his hand's in the way.
4955628	4959771	Dear Brad, I secretly am harboring a fetish for you.
4965776	4966537	Here, wait.
4966757	4969099	Wait, you have to show Jamie what I wrote.
4969520	4970220	He wrote penis.
4970801	4972282	Yeah, sorry about penis.
4973223	4976666	Penis!
4976726	4977687	It's like candy heart.
4977847	4978547	It's penis heart.
4978667	4978928	Get it?
4979348	4979388	Oh.
4981841	4984262	And in the next mix, in DDR Extreme, we'll have Penis Star.
4984823	4985443	Penis Star.
4985783	4987064	And then there's Vagina Heart.
4990506	4991046	Trainwreck!
4992647	4993587	Crash!
4996269	4997389	Loki, you look really tired.
4997469	4997930	What's wrong?
5000191	5001332	I'm really tired!
5006234	5006955	I knew about what?
5007615	5008355	That he was tired.
5010091	5011372	What songs did you just play?
5011392	5012172	It's a secret to everyone.
5012312	5012853	What edits?
5012913	5013933	What fun edits were you playing?
5014113	5016175	What dirty themed edits did you play this time?
5016575	5017375	I didn't play edits.
5018256	5018556	What?
5019116	5025801	I played Boom Boom Dollar Maniac Doubles, and then I played Wonderland Maniac, and then I played Nizibutu Maniac Doubles.
5027201	5028302	What a bootylicious mix.
5029163	5030003	Shake that booty.
5030263	5030563	Wow.
5033205	5035706	There's tokens in that game over there.
5035726	5036067	What game?
5036767	5037047	Fourth.
5037768	5037928	Oh.
5038108	5039349	There's tokens in fourth mix.
5039429	5039629	Hey.
5040359	5041680	Three-hole one?
5042581	5042781	Yeah.
5042821	5043681	Three-hole critter?
5043741	5046043	Hey, let's take the show to the fourth mix machine.
5046063	5047704	Okay, we're going to go over to the fourth mix machine.
5048325	5050206	Oh, dude, there's a lot of crazy kids on there.
5050346	5052768	Experimental and sucky radio.
5054609	5055970	Hey, this radio doesn't suck.
5058772	5059973	Hey, Brad left his napkin.
5060033	5061334	What an ungrateful little bastard.
5061354	5062454	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
5062815	5063515	Come back here.
5063555	5064496	I'm grabbing this napkin.
5065990	5067291	I'm going to beat Brad over the head with it.
5067571	5068251	Hold on, hold on.
5068311	5069352	I've got to put it in the back here.
5070192	5071133	This is great radio.
5071473	5072273	How was your week, Jamie?
5072994	5074535	My week was interesting.
5075095	5075475	Not really.
5075955	5076356	I worked.
5077316	5077836	Yeah, me too.
5078857	5080678	We apparently got people crowded around the machine.
5080698	5081238	Wow, we got people.
5081378	5081879	This is weird.
5081919	5082219	Look at this.
5082799	5085481	One person on Max 2 and a whole crowd around 4th Mix.
5085501	5086281	Take the microphone.
5086621	5086921	Okay.
5087902	5089123	There's too many little kids.
5089283	5090243	I'm going to kill them.
5091264	5093245	Okay, what we're going to do right now, we're going to go ahead.
5094045	5095506	Jamie, where's the clock?
5096613	5098114	It said like 34 or something.
5098274	5098714	Oh, shit.
5099095	5100375	Okay, we're going to go ahead and go to break.
5101036	5102256	And then we will come back.
5102317	5104198	I'm going to play more DDR.
5104518	5106439	Okay, and we're going to wrap up the show in one more segment.
5106459	5107760	So please stay tuned.
5107840	5108640	I'm hungry.
5108660	5109761	Wait, do you have a final thought, Loki?
5109821	5111862	What do you want, Matt?
5112182	5112543	Which one?
5112863	5113743	Okay, question.
5113944	5118146	How many people does it take to play versus mode in fourth mix?
5118466	5120007	If you're three or six, it looks like five.
5120047	5121368	If you're that young, five.
5123049	5126191	One to press the button and one for each of the little arrows.
5127358	5129562	Alright, we're going to go to a break.
5129582	5130463	We'll be right back.
5130503	5130704	Later.
5249690	5264154	Sound of Speed Are you ready?
5265114	5267575	Ready for the race, are you ready?
5268135	5268675	Are you ready?
5276880	5278781	Ready for the race, are you ready?
5278801	5279921	Are you ready?
5279961	5280902	Are you ready?
5381614	5383364	The Wraith, From Outer Space
5428213	5431307	This is a journey into the sound of speed.
5478004	5483008	Okay, we're coming back from break, and Jamie wanted to show off, so she's getting on Max 2 right now.
5483048	5484329	Now, why are you picking this song?
5484970	5485770	Just because it's fun.
5485950	5487511	Don't you think it's overplayed to all hell?
5487812	5488012	No.
5490454	5491194	Well, that's that.
5493376	5494757	Thank you for taking that microphone away.
5494777	5495718	I was getting all tangled up.
5498499	5500720	This is going to be amazing for our listeners.
5500800	5502401	They are going to be blown away.
5503501	5505042	Let's read off Jamie's combo.
5505062	5505822	4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, boom.
5506082	5506522	Perfect.
5506742	5507022	Perfect.
5507122	5507663	4, 5, 6, 8, 9, boom.
5514446	5515307	Great, great, perfect.
5515327	5515307	5, 6.
5515447	5516347	Great, great, perfect.
5516367	5516347	4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21.
5516568	5517528	So, what about this weekend?
5517548	5518809	So what are we going to be doing?
5519009	5519750	Wait, back to the song.
5519770	5520150	Great, perfect.
5520170	5520150	24, 25.
5520210	5520150	9, 11.
5520310	5521211	4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.
5520530	5521211	4, 5.
5520570	5521211	She's doing Riverdance.
5521231	5521311	What?
5521331	5521631	What's wrong?
5544847	5545627	Her pants are stupid.
5545647	5547628	Are your pants going to fall off while you're playing Kakumei?
5548428	5548668	Yes!
5549189	5550369	I'll buy that for a dollar.
5555331	5557031	Hold on to the bar for dear life, Jamie.
5557871	5558292	Hell no.
5559192	5560472	Hell no is right.
5563833	5565314	Don't you think this video is so generic?
5565814	5566634	I love this video.
5566654	5566714	Why?
5566754	5569175	It's like flashing squares, flashing blocks.
5569195	5569795	It's like a rave.
5569815	5570476	Flashing squares.
5571456	5572396	I'm so fucked up.
5575473	5576414	What is that song?
5576694	5578455	What the hell is that animation supposed to be?
5578515	5583178	It's like, ooh, I'm flying through a tunnel of color, and there's colored boxes.
5583198	5584159	It looks like a birth canal.
5584179	5585239	That looks like a tunnel.
5586800	5587201	Come on, Jamie.
5587321	5587581	It does.
5589062	5589562	You can do it.
5590362	5591023	You can do it.
5593144	5593685	She passed.
5593785	5596086	Oh, how does it feel to be a winner?
5596106	5597867	Thank you for falling off me.
5606807	5609829	I'd like to point out that Jamie, by the way, has burning feet right now.
5610890	5611390	Burning feet.
5611590	5612291	She's burning the floor.
5612571	5615693	My pants are too big.
5616674	5618415	And I was tripping over them the whole time.
5622759	5623639	Now why this song?
5624140	5625280	It's Viking Superstar.
5631825	5632786	Oh my god, no.
5637162	5639062	She's playing Love To Me Lite.
5640703	5646784	I think we can expect to see a lot of... Wait, wait.
5646864	5648084	Oh, hell yeah.
5648384	5652365	Oh, wait a minute.
5655446	5656766	We fell out again for a minute.
5656846	5657666	Technical difficulties.
5659207	5660387	And I was... I'm so fucking out of breath.
5661334	5663576	And I was talking to the microphone pretending like it was plugged in.
5664197	5664417	Yes.
5664638	5665519	Aren't I a stupid ass?
5665579	5665879	Sorry.
5666440	5668081	She's going to be doing a freestyle.
5668462	5669663	Oh, she's facing away.
5670143	5671805	Oh, let's go around to the other side.
5672866	5674128	Let's stand next to the carousel.
5675834	5676895	This is amazing.
5676915	5678116	Oh, she's not even looking.
5678396	5681778	For those who want to check out the webcam and see this going on, you can't.
5682118	5683579	Yeah, you can't.
5684019	5686181	What is the address, Rob?
5686481	5690784	www.goatsay.cx Goat say?
5690824	5691645	What's goat say?
5691785	5692245	Never mind.
5694206	5695867	Oh, she got a 50 combo.
5697168	5697729	Holy shit.
5698089	5699490	Oh, I think she just did a spin.
5701111	5701911	Knee drop, knee drop.
5702051	5702792	Knee drop, knee drop.
5703542	5704723	No, no, no, no, never mind.
5706704	5708325	Oh, she lost her balance and broke her combo.
5710246	5711467	Fuck, I shouldn't have said that.
5712107	5712327	What?
5712788	5713708	She's going to hurt herself.
5714308	5717831	That was a pretty strong thud there.
5721032	5722213	Let's go to the fourth mix.
5722393	5723894	Let's see what the kids are up to on fourth mix.
5723914	5724755	We're going to leave Jamie?
5725215	5725775	Yeah, we'll come back.
5725975	5726256	Okay.
5726536	5727116	She's a big girl.
5727136	5727977	She'll be okay by herself.
5730398	5731298	Let's see what they're playing over here.
5731319	5731819	What are you doing?
5733112	5734133	Are you insane?
5735414	5736755	I think this is, what is this, Saints?
5736896	5738297	I can't even, oh, it's one of Loki's edits.
5738797	5739658	Oh, it's Ninja Burrow.
5741800	5742961	No, oh, it is.
5750288	5751049	Hey, you failed.
5751249	5751949	Oh, you failed.
5752530	5753511	You suck, Loki.
5753691	5754752	How does it feel to suck?
5755484	5755964	I don't care.
5755984	5756785	I'm tired.
5756865	5757605	That was hard.
5758646	5759666	That looked like it was pretty hard.
5761587	5762668	It was all six of those.
5762708	5763829	It's too bad to do that kind of shit.
5764369	5765770	Game over!
5765830	5766330	Pulled out.
5768491	5774134	Have you ever noticed that when you put the memory card, it says inserted, and we take it out, it says pulled out?
5774194	5777896	I think Naoki is a very perverted person.
5780077	5782859	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
5784080	5784260	What?
5785885	5786406	What'd you say now?
5786846	5790529	Even with my thumble, I missed four and got an A. Are you bleeding, Jamie?
5790549	5791289	You're not bleeding, are you?
5794331	5795332	She's okay!
5795592	5796473	She's red, but she's okay.
5798997	5800118	What song is she gonna pick?
5800258	5802340	Yes, we know you're fat there, you already mentioned it.
5802380	5803081	You're not that fat!
5803321	5804902	You're husky, you're husky.
5805763	5807564	I probably got a bigger belly than you do.
5808005	5809386	How much, have you lost weight playing DDR?
5809866	5810627	Yeah, how much?
5811027	5811548	Like 40 pounds?
5811568	5812669	Did you stop eating fat?
5812689	5816092	No, see, I lost a bunch of weight when I did wrestling, and then I worked at Jack in the Box, and I got super fat.
5827014	5828835	So fuck Jack in the Box and his stupid ass.
5830036	5832578	Oh, don't eat Jack in the Box chicken sandwiches.
5832859	5833799	They drop them on the floor.
5834720	5835361	Thank you for sharing.
5836041	5842046	Ooh, she's spinning the disc.
5845068	5847010	Now see, this video's pretty cool.
5847230	5848131	People dancing and shit.
5849512	5850793	Yeah, but it says heat up.
5852739	5855080	I love the English they usually have in the background sometimes.
5855800	5858481	What would you say is your favorite movie in all of Max 2?
5859582	5860222	Max 2?
5862723	5864624	I'd have to go with Tsugaru.
5865824	5867985	Why Tsugaru?
5868105	5871346	Those funny-looking bald dudes with the little thing on their head spinning around.
5872226	5872807	It's funny again.
5873087	5873667	Cool, cool.
5874507	5876908	No, we need to change our mind.
5876928	5878129	This is such great radio.
5878729	5879169	This is better.
5879189	5881330	I'm going to harass the waitress and the interviewer and shit.
5883345	5884506	There's always next time.
5884546	5885527	They'll probably kick us out.
5886867	5888589	Dude, some of those waitresses are hella cool.
5889329	5891270	Yeah, but last time when we were at Golf Land.
5892091	5892811	Fuck Golf Land.
5893212	5893472	Okay.
5894493	5898896	But they have Soul Calibur 2 and Initial D, so... Fuck them all except for those two games.
5900236	5901697	Hey, I bet you they're broken today.
5902378	5902698	Yeah.
5903058	5903639	Yeah, probably.
5904599	5908182	Have you ever played this machine, the electrifying machine, the one that shocks you?
5909511	5910252	Does it shock you?
5910412	5910973	I've never played it.
5910993	5911753	Yeah, it shocks you.
5912274	5912955	Are you serious?
5912975	5913555	You want to play it?
5914436	5915217	Play it live on air.
5915297	5917639	Let's see if it will erase the tape.
5917719	5918961	Well, yeah, I can't stand too close.
5919181	5922204	Yeah, it will, but... Sorry, the printer doesn't work.
5922444	5923285	Isn't it four tokens?
5924006	5925848	Wait, put one in and see how many it wants.
5926348	5926769	Put one in.
5927089	5927409	Yeah.
5929271	5929932	Okay, it wants four.
5930933	5932695	Dude, you're going to get hella zapped and shit.
5934108	5937630	Alright everybody, he's playing the electrifying Uncle Fester, the new adaptation.
5937650	5939411	We're going to ask him what it feels like while he's playing.
5940371	5941852	High power, and hold on to both of them.
5942032	5942613	Hold on to both.
5943873	5945234	Tell us the sensation.
5946395	5946655	Ready?
5947335	5948356	Don't let go, don't be a puss.
5950597	5951417	It's not even on yet.
5955759	5956720	It's vibrating.
5957620	5959121	I feel something.
5959141	5959982	Oh, this is kind of nice.
5961342	5962183	Oh, yeah, that's a...
5963633	5989105	it says are you getting an electro oh my god come on you can do it take it take it no come on you're almost there you gotta get yeah yeah you gotta hit a 3000 you're almost there take it take it i smell burning flesh that's just me yeah
5994355	5997538	We have... Let's see your hands.
5998659	5999099	Did it hurt?
6000160	6001241	Yeah, kind of.
6001261	6005285	I want to see if it smells like burning flesh.
6007306	6008187	I think I'm in love.
6009909	6011430	Now, how was that vibrating sensation?
6011450	6012231	You should try two-player.
6013692	6014112	Oh, no.
6014433	6016154	Yeah, two can play, you just have to hold hands.
6016875	6017115	Owie.
6019685	6021046	I guess it forms like a circuit.
6021507	6024489	Only in America would you give a machine a dollar to beat you up.
6025790	6026391	Seriously.
6026511	6028432	Well, we got that arm wrestling machine that's broken.
6028512	6029453	What did he get out of that?
6029533	6031595	Nothing, because the damn printer's broken.
6032216	6033076	You know what I say to that?
6033096	6034097	I think I sold my pants.
6034898	6036519	I feel inclined to go play Afterburner.
6037200	6038160	You want to go play Afterburner?
6038180	6040002	We have a working Afterburner here in Sandia.
6040042	6041043	Let's go play Afterburner.
6042569	6045151	And here we go to play the all-time favorite.
6046212	6049695	I was asking, hey Jamie, I'll ask you the same question I asked Brad while you were playing Spin the Disc.
6050115	6051877	What would you say is your favorite Max 2 video?
6054679	6055340	Long Train Runnin'.
6056109	6057190	Long train running, right on.
6057391	6058592	Just cause the dude looks kinda cool.
6059013	6063358	I would say my favorite would be the whistle song, even though it's overplayed, that bunny just rules.
6063999	6066462	Should I go for the classic afterburner?
6066842	6067823	Classic afterburner.
6068584	6071628	Or my favorite bicycle game prop cycle?
6072068	6072569	Afterburner.
6072769	6073190	Afterburner.
6074136	6077259	and the all-time favorite, no, this is Afterburner 2.
6078140	6079161	This is the sequel.
6079221	6080402	How do you feel about the sequel?
6080602	6083685	They have an old-school Afterburner machine that actually moves.
6083705	6084685	You sit in the cockpit.
6085086	6087488	They need the freaking space harrier.
6088189	6088849	He said cock.
6088869	6090711	Someone give me a token.
6091311	6093553	Hey, honey, go get her a token.
6094374	6095415	What is she, your bitch?
6095855	6096136	No.
6097532	6100434	How do you feel about being bossed around by this guy?
6100474	6100995	Don't go there.
6101035	6101255	No.
6101315	6101555	No.
6102716	6103077	No.
6103097	6103637	I'm going there.
6103677	6104598	I'm going there.
6104898	6105038	No.
6105118	6105379	No.
6105479	6106740	I just ignore him half the time.
6106920	6107360	Good job.
6107420	6107821	Good job.
6107941	6108381	You go, girl.
6108401	6109722	Until about 10 o'clock at night.
6110383	6112204	Another story.
6113245	6113805	Oh, my.
6113865	6115407	You're listening to KTMI.
6120611	6121472	It's sick stream.
6122813	6123373	Where'd she go?
6123573	6124534	Oh, here she comes.
6124554	6125135	Here she comes.
6126232	6127373	Our beautiful Jamie.
6128753	6129814	Oh, hey, it's a one now.
6129834	6130294	What the hell?
6130534	6131175	I thought it was two.
6132075	6133056	Ooh, I get to hold the purse.
6133076	6135157	No, it's four tokens to play, but it's worth it.
6136197	6137638	You can, like, go sideways in this thing.
6137658	6139219	Does it, like, vibrate and shit?
6139239	6139539	Watch.
6139579	6140059	What happens?
6141020	6142841	Do you need... Oh, you need... She's strapping on.
6142981	6143361	Or in.
6143641	6144882	She's strapping herself in.
6145702	6146262	Oh, no, she isn't.
6146282	6148824	She's going... Oh, she's going strapless.
6150705	6152706	No strap on for her tonight.
6154727	6155187	We need what?
6156852	6160935	Okay.
6162937	6166679	I'm getting squishy.
6166980	6167780	Oh, here you go.
6167800	6168241	Get ready.
6168301	6169922	It will move, by the way.
6169942	6171263	You gotta move back out.
6171283	6172604	Yeah, back out of the way a little.
6182851	6186974	Look how the monitor like totally bends at a 45 degree angle when she plays.
6186994	6189156	This game kicks Beachhead's 2000's ass.
6204591	6209414	But it doesn't have the cool, uh, bubble for the, uh, Sumo, like Sumo has.
6209454	6209654	True.
6209674	6210195	That's true.
6210415	6211495	It's not Sumo.
6211816	6213857	But it's, it's old school Sega.
6214697	6216379	Recording their songs and shit?
6216419	6216839	Nah, fuck em.
6216899	6217519	It's free promotion!
6217539	6218040	Kickstarter too.
6218060	6218160	Yes.
6251358	6252358	Oh, she's reloading.
6254219	6255559	Super Zappa recharge.
6256859	6257619	She's getting filled.
6263540	6265621	How come the machine doesn't do loop-de-loops when she does?
6266401	6268161	How come the machine doesn't blow up when she does?
6268181	6268721	Did you die?
6270882	6271242	Yeah.
6271262	6271882	How did it feel?
6271922	6272882	Was it the rest of your life?
6273242	6274302	Dude, retro gaming owns.
6275463	6276103	I'll play a game.
6276163	6277123	I'll play the prop cycle.
6277938	6278899	Loki's lesson of the day.
6278919	6280720	Don't drink 44 ounces of Pepsi and play Cat of Devils all day.
6298270	6302413	How about don't go eat a bunch of Mongolian barbecue and then play three 8-footers in a row?
6302594	6304435	I can't play double catas anyways.
6304455	6311161	Last time I was here, I had just gotten done eating Mongo Chow and I played Superstar, Holic, and Spin the Disc all in a row.
6311301	6315085	Maybe I should get some Mike's Hard Lemonade because I think an alien is going to pop out of my chest.
6316069	6316790	That sounds good.
6317331	6319474	Just, you know, as long as you're actually a real person.
6320215	6324642	Just drink like 12 of them and in an hour you get really fucked up.
6324662	6325443	You look drunk already.
6325783	6327186	Loki is our sweat elemental.
6328800	6330861	And now Rob's going to fly.
6331461	6331962	Oh, yes.
6332542	6335984	He's going... I hope that this has actually sound today.
6336464	6340486	I'd like to stipulate that I've never played this game in my entire life.
6340806	6343508	Pointers, pedal fast.
6344228	6344968	Don't run into stuff.
6345289	6347210	And don't be afraid not to pedal to descend.
6347670	6348030	Okay.
6348770	6350231	You need to steer tightly.
6352592	6353473	I have to do it tight?
6354013	6354774	You have to be tight.
6354834	6355414	Okay, here we go.
6356138	6356438	Get it.
6357159	6358480	And there's no sound on the machine.
6358760	6359381	Yeah.
6360501	6361062	Go us.
6361162	6363343	Rob is going for level one.
6364284	6365305	No, level two.
6365445	6366406	No, he's level one.
6366586	6366866	Level one.
6366886	6368787	Is that a finger or a... He's going to cliff rock.
6368807	6369668	What do I do?
6369688	6369928	Pedal.
6369948	6370349	Pedal.
6370669	6371710	Where do I pedal to?
6371750	6374332	You can push into the... Burst the balloons.
6374632	6375112	Burst it.
6376553	6377594	Go run into the balloons.
6377674	6380977	Just in case you're supposed to be...
6383243	6385665	It's supposed to make you feel like you're getting... Never mind.
6385785	6386165	Shit.
6386566	6387807	I'll just leave that alone.
6387827	6388367	That's just wrong.
6388387	6390188	Rob's doing pretty good for a beginner, by the way.
6390248	6391129	Rob's kicking ass.
6391489	6391710	Okay.
6391910	6392410	Oh, oh, oh.
6392490	6392991	Yes, you got 200, 100.
6393091	6393351	Oh, yeah.
6393371	6393731	Fuck that shit.
6393931	6394051	Oh.
6394151	6397874	No, I missed that one.
6397934	6399215	And Rob has an orgasm.
6399275	6399876	Shit, I missed one.
6400016	6400256	Oh, well.
6400276	6400476	It's okay.
6400496	6400977	Just keep going.
6401977	6402638	Smash that.
6403739	6403999	Hit it.
6405160	6405800	Yeah, yeah.
6406601	6408082	Oh, there's a dude on the roof.
6408122	6408983	You should have killed him.
6411638	6412039	Don't run in.
6412079	6412939	You need that.
6412959	6413680	That gives you more time.
6413700	6415862	Ooh, get the shiny balloons.
6416562	6416822	Matt.
6418724	6421546	For the record, Rob is owning at this game for his first time.
6421566	6423387	He's got an eight perfect balloon run.
6427110	6428331	He just got two and one.
6428652	6429092	Turn around.
6429152	6430013	You need to get six.
6430473	6431454	You need to get six more balloons.
6431934	6432154	What?
6434716	6435477	Go in the hole.
6436437	6437198	This is such crap.
6437378	6437779	Go down.
6437899	6440041	Go down under the waterfall.
6441143	6441543	Go down.
6442424	6442805	Here he goes.
6442845	6444046	He's going down, folks.
6444366	6445127	Shit, I missed it.
6446329	6446849	That's okay.
6446889	6447670	You've got more stuff here.
6448071	6448912	Oh, get the pink one.
6451484	6455886	Rob goes for 10 seconds, and he has increased his time.
6457427	6463830	So far his score is a whopping... He has 2,150 points.
6464070	6464651	Wow, we can't read.
6464751	6467812	And now he's out of the cave, and he's going into the tent.
6469133	6470013	I'm flying!
6471454	6472935	I'm flying!
6473015	6474155	Now he comes out of the tent.
6476016	6476957	I was locked.
6478259	6479060	I was wobbed.
6479260	6481502	No, you can't say that's another inside joke.
6481522	6482162	There we go.
6482803	6483503	Oh, hit that shit.
6484264	6484784	Go faster.
6485385	6486285	Get it.
6486325	6486425	It's 500.
6486506	6486626	It's 500.
6487026	6487226	No, it's 200.
6487646	6488167	I can't read.
6488547	6489468	Oh, there's another one.
6489968	6490949	Oh, you got it.
6491129	6492050	You got four more balloons.
6492330	6493691	Yeah, Rob's going to crash.
6493871	6495012	That's a wall.
6496673	6497314	Oh, shit.
6497854	6499555	Yes, this game is brought to you by Doom On.
6500216	6501797	This game is brought to you by, oh, shit.
6502297	6503598	No, it's Namco.
6504179	6505059	A fan, what's his name?
6505099	6507121	Remember, Namco owns your soul.
6507671	6508071	I died.
6508812	6510093	So what do you think of Prop Cycle?
6510213	6515136	That was actually pretty... Oh, dude, it shows... I had no sense of direction.
6515617	6516597	Pop four balloons.
6517518	6520100	And Rob got wing leader for his first time.
6520140	6520960	That is not bad.
6520980	6521641	That's like third place.
6521661	6522501	That was kind of fun.
6522581	6524663	It would have been better if the game actually had sound.
6525103	6527465	Because I'll tell you, that was like the worst radio ever.
6529355	6530516	Uh-oh, Matt's going to play.
6530696	6531797	Dude, don't you have to pee?
6531857	6532838	Dude, wait, wait.
6533298	6537281	Missile Command, Centipede, Millipede.
6537661	6540023	Remember, what is Centipede and Millipede famous for?
6540403	6541223	The one sound.
6543685	6544946	That's your one-up noise.
6545166	6546487	Wait a minute.
6547408	6549629	What's the difference between Centipede and Millipede?
6549769	6550370	I don't remember.
6550790	6554813	Hey, what's the difference between Centipede and Millipede?
6555533	6557475	Millipede is faster and harder and it's longer.
6558448	6559049	Like Shaft?
6559089	6561611	It's faster, harder, and longer, just like Shaft.
6564133	6564453	Okay.
6564654	6567076	As Matt goes for, ooh, the hard level.
6567096	6568097	The Solitaire.
6569178	6570339	Oh, dude, that dude has wings.
6573341	6577085	And he is going for it with a vengeance.
6577105	6577085	100.
6577185	6579387	And another 100.
6579467	6580508	Ooh, a choo-choo train.
6580568	6581148	And a train.
6581368	6583710	A choo-choo.
6583750	6585352	I remember this level being really hard.
6586317	6586837	What the hell?
6586957	6588798	That's a... He has to dive through the hole.
6590198	6592159	And he got it, the one that was in the hole.
6593460	6594760	And now he's heading into the cave.
6594800	6596021	Loki, go down the hole.
6597401	6601623	I want to flush the potty.
6601683	6603163	What happens when he gets a thousand right there?
6604964	6606544	And now he is in the subway.
6606885	6609185	Getting hit by... Running into poles.
6609886	6611226	This game is full of poles and holes.
6612127	6613027	Poles and holes.
6616095	6622258	And he's got another 10 seconds, but he's only got 31 left.
6622958	6623938	What's the thousand mean?
6624579	6625159	What thousand?
6625499	6626740	The thousand below his score.
6630341	6630881	Lovely.
6633763	6635123	Wow, he's kind of good at this game.
6635243	6635403	And 18.
6638184	6639345	He advanced one day.
6639705	6640145	Day one.
6641086	6641486	Day?
6641826	6643787	Well, he's been flying for a whole day, folks.
6645069	6648692	and he's chasing another balloon around a girder and he decided not to go at it.
6649032	6650293	He's going into another hole.
6650313	6651874	It's just me.
6652875	6653955	It's me, Mario.
6654155	6655316	No, you're not Mario.
6655416	6656377	Not Mario.
6656737	6657558	Wario.
6657658	6658418	See, I told you.
6658438	6658899	Oh, shit.
6658939	6659799	They're playing the punching game.
6659819	6660960	Dude, that chick would kick my ass.
6660980	6663002	And he's got another ten seconds and ran into a wall.
6663022	6663722	Oh, that's a wall, dude.
6664383	6665163	Oh, that's a person.
6665183	6666464	I don't want to hear about your ass.
6666784	6669926	And apparently you cannot knock down the people that are in the cave.
6670847	6671448	Fuck that.
6672677	6673237	That's scary.
6673357	6674138	And time is up.
6674178	6675739	So how well did Loki do?
6676239	6677720	Two points for one play on this game?
6678500	6679321	I think that's right.
6679341	6680161	He got 1,400 points.
6680201	6681021	He completed the level.
6683683	6684743	And he gets an ending.
6686124	6687725	No, dude, that's Coffee Man Joe.
6687745	6689766	Hey, it's Ryo from... I made it.
6689786	6691827	Dude, the guy in Prop Cycle looks like Ryo from Digimon.
6692327	6692688	Oh, no.
6693948	6695209	He's now going to day two.
6698119	6700340	You didn't get enough points.
6700860	6703682	No, actually he did the first thing where you only play once.
6707483	6708584	These people are scaring me.
6709865	6712906	I want to see exactly how this goddamn punching bag game... Oh, there it is.
6714026	6715307	It pops down.
6715507	6716928	So are we ready to close the show?
6717408	6718308	I don't know, where's the clock?
6719809	6723171	Did we have like another minute and a half to fill?
6724371	6725912	This is the last segment five minutes early.
6727156	6727877	Oh, that's right.
6728277	6729138	We wanted to go play DDR.
6729158	6730379	This is such awful radio.
6730719	6732280	What can we do that's exciting for listeners?
6733121	6733561	Strip!
6733921	6734642	I was going to say that.
6734662	6736904	Let's start streaking through Scandia.
6736924	6738965	Then we're sure not to have Tourney here.
6740106	6741827	No, because they don't know that I'm from here.
6743008	6743588	They don't know me.
6744489	6746450	Let's take a tour around the rest of the arcade, shall we?
6746490	6747391	Let's go play Bubble Bobble.
6747731	6748612	Where's Bubble Bobble?
6749269	6751311	I thought I heard Bubble Bobble.
6751411	6756456	No, it's just Ultracade has the Bubble Bobble sounds in it, but it doesn't have Bubble Bobble loaded yet.
6756536	6757496	It's going to have it in there.
6760599	6762020	They're playing the punching bag game.
6763242	6764643	It is not Punch Mania, by the way.
6770448	6770768	Wow.
6771609	6773190	I want to see what a weakling I am.
6773471	6774592	I'm going to get more tokens, okay?
6776124	6779727	Let's go ahead and do the... You know, there's two Centipede machines here.
6780468	6781749	Let's walk around and poke at stuff.
6781809	6782169	Alright.
6782850	6786173	Well, everyone heard Afterburner, which I played because I'm cool.
6787034	6788075	We have Centipede.
6788095	6790817	We have one of the best shooter games ever, Raiden Fighter.
6791378	6793299	Oh, dude, you can buy this shit for a thousand bucks.
6793540	6794701	Wow, a thousand for Centipede.
6794721	6795802	I can play it on my Atari 5200 at home.
6795882	6797403	Oh, we got a Harley game.
6800415	6802296	The old, old Harley game that's been out.
6802316	6802596	It's old?
6802776	6803316	Yeah, it's pretty old.
6803876	6804336	A couple years.
6804676	6810598	We have Tekken Tag Tournament, which I've been hearing should be upgraded to a Tekken 4, but I don't know if it's going to be by 2029.
6810638	6813058	We have Marvel vs. Capcom 2, a very, very fun game.
6813118	6815599	Revolution X, one of the most fun gun games ever.
6815679	6822040	We have Alien vs. Predator, Daytona USA, on cue.
6822540	6823601	Daytona!
6824341	6827122	We have House of the Dead 2, which you can play on Dreamcast.
6827162	6828522	Remember, typing of the dead is fun.
6829418	6830379	Oh, I've heard of that game.
6830459	6832040	We have Got Left Dark Legacy.
6832900	6834762	We have Golden Tee 4.
6835922	6836203	No, that's 4.
6837343	6838444	Not 4 with a hyphen.
6838484	6843467	Which reminds me, the very first place I ever played Golden Tee was a little ghetto cade in Roseville called Supercade.
6843768	6845749	Supercade closed this month.
6845929	6846429	The guy retired.
6846449	6847330	Let's have a moment of silence.
6847350	6848491	A moment of silence for Supercade.
6849571	6851773	Okay, Supercade ruled because they have Playboy Pinball.
6851793	6852413	That's all I had to say.
6852493	6853754	Anyway, I want to show off.
6853874	6854935	Let's see what a weakling I am.
6857156	6857937	Alright, everybody.
6859455	6863756	and someone is playing Rockman Power Battles.
6864716	6867617	No, he's playing Rockman.
6868537	6869878	No, actually that's Proto Man right there.
6869958	6871738	No, but the game came out as Rockman.
6871818	6873378	Alright, now Rob's going to punch the thingy.
6873398	6874399	He's going to punch this thing.
6874419	6875119	Let's listen to this.
6875139	6878480	Let's see, what has he become?
6878540	6881300	Rob on the meter is, he hit 290.
6882541	6883781	Okay, he gets to hit it again. 290.
6889656	6890397	I think Rob gets one more try.
6890417	6890957	I think that's good.
6892118	6892338	No.
6892739	6893920	Dude, you didn't even get a rating.
6894000	6894580	I didn't register.
6895081	6896442	Rob did not register.
6896762	6897383	Let me try.
6897863	6898384	Okay, hold on.
6898864	6900025	Rob's going to give me money to play.
6901086	6901667	Who holds what?
6901887	6903208	I'm going to probably get really bad.
6905990	6908573	If you do better than Rob, you get to autograph something for yourself.
6909293	6910414	Alright, here's the microphone.
6911175	6911775	Okay, here we go.
6911815	6914478	Jamie's going to show off what a stud she is.
6915211	6915671	Here she goes.
6916712	6917412	She's revving up.
6917832	6919253	Oh, cracking her knuckles.
6923194	6923755	Here she goes.
6926856	6927596	She also got 290.
6927856	6932038	You know, I think 290 is what you get when you hit it so weak it didn't even register.
6932278	6932678	Try again.
6932838	6933418	Try again, Jamie.
6934259	6934999	Don't let that scurry off.
6935299	6938200	How many times did you put... I put one.
6938841	6939521	Should I try one more?
6940268	6940829	All right, here we go.
6940989	6941990	How come nobody's registering?
6942010	6943411	Does that mean... I'm going to try one more.
6943431	6943931	I'm going to do it.
6944131	6945513	I'm going to do my Popeye hit, okay?
6946914	6947835	All right, here we go, here we go.
6947995	6948675	Flying jump kick.
6948695	6949116	Here you go, Jim.
6949656	6950317	I want to kick it.
6951398	6952118	But I'm too short.
6952419	6952519	Oh.
6953400	6954881	I don't think I could even kick that high.
6954901	6956743	I could, like, axe kick it or something.
6957523	6958364	All right, here we go.
6958384	6961447	Oops, I stepped on your foot.
6961487	6961847	My bad.
6961867	6963789	I didn't feel anything.
6964864	6965864	Oh, you're a playboy.
6965904	6967185	Rob went over the scale.
6967225	6968245	Rob is now a playboy.
6969086	6971787	Oh, I bet you these two are like the lights are out.
6972307	6973147	You only get one punch.
6973547	6974188	I want to play again.
6974748	6975468	I'm a playboy.
6975488	6976709	I want to play again.
6977149	6977909	Okay, I got one more.
6977949	6978289	Here we go.
6978489	6979210	I'm going to headbutt it.
6980930	6981290	Are you really?
6981330	6982071	It's not going to hurt.
6982491	6983531	No, my head's too hard.
6985852	6989013	Hold on, I'm digging deep into my pocket.
6989033	6990694	Rob's digging deep into his pants.
6992675	6993315	Go, Jamie, go.
6994934	6997396	This may make her forget how much deep... Here we go.
6999197	7000258	She can't reach to kick it.
7000398	7003880	I can actually reach the ball to kick it, but not high enough to actually kick it up into the thing.
7004760	7004900	Ow.
7004980	7005541	You go, girl.
7005581	7005921	Come on.
7006762	7007262	Here she goes.
7008283	7010624	And... Pow.
7011364	7012005	She got 210.
7012525	7012885	Try again.
7012905	7013666	See if it'll let you do it again.
7015907	7016067	Oh.
7018409	7018949	Hang on it.
7019149	7021150	Jamie's a weakling, but that's okay.
7021171	7021831	We love her anyway.
7025234	7027676	And now to relieve myself, I'm going to go sulk.
7029637	7032118	We're actually about ready to wrap up this train wreck of a show.
7032678	7033399	Here comes Matt, though.
7034620	7038062	Oh, Matt is also a Playboy, but I would like to point out I believe I was a little stronger.
7038382	7039122	Did he get Superman?
7039563	7041083	A Playboy Superman.
7041183	7042524	He got Playboy and Superman?
7042604	7043945	He went over the scale.
7044005	7046787	Oh, no, what I think is lots of the lights are out, but they all light up.
7046807	7048508	You know, I think this machine is just fucked up.
7050549	7051850	Hmm, Roseville, anyone?
7052978	7054379	We'll have to tell Keith to fix his machine.
7054819	7056680	Okay.
7057080	7059221	It's time to end the show.
7059521	7060562	Final thoughts, Jamie?
7061862	7065884	I don't have anything to drink to burp, so, uh... This is kind of fun.
7066905	7067445	Oh, bite me.
7068285	7068725	It's fun.
7069566	7070646	Final thoughts from Derek?
7071467	7072387	I already have a microphone.
7073388	7074988	Final thoughts, though?
7075909	7077309	Uh... Give me that.
7078450	7079490	Final thoughts from Matt?
7080551	7080631	Um...
7081294	7085558	That chick in that police 911 too had huge tits.
7086039	7088441	How can she fight crime and have huge tits at the same time?
7088501	7089142	It's not right.
7089282	7089902	The Wonderbra.
7091484	7092885	Any final thoughts from the love slave?
7094907	7095488	I'm hungry.
7096349	7096769	Oh my.
7098651	7099592	You might just get fed.
7100993	7102074	Let's go get manga chow.
7102134	7102795	I hope they're still open.
7102815	7103696	Dude, police brutality.
7104847	7105808	We're ending this show now.
7105828	7106789	Thanks everybody for listening.
7106909	7110612	My final thought, the listeners are never going to let us take a week off again.
7111312	7112213	But we love you anyway.
7112393	7114635	Thanks for listening to our pre-taped madness.
7114755	7117037	Why does it say puff puff and his hand's in his pocket?
7118939	7120300	We'll see you guys next week.
7120340	7121081	We'll be live.
7121241	7126845	And our fortune cookie message of the week is, are you in joy?
7128267	7128787	Very nice.
7128867	7129207	Thank you.
7129968	7130889	We'll see you guys next week.
7131565	7135228	Next week when we'll be live and you can yell at us in the chat room and tell us we suck.
7135989	7138331	This time I won't be there so you don't have to worry about me.
7139032	7141454	Yeah, because Derek's in deep trouble.
7141854	7145358	Oh no, he's not in just deep trouble, he's in... Boiling diarrhea.
7145538	7147119	Not boiling diarrhea anymore.
7147680	7149922	You are now stuck somewhere in constipation land.
7150763	7153386	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
7173826	7178150	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
