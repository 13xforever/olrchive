9424	10284	It's a videotape!
10665	11065	Put it in!
11105	11545	Put it in!
16827	20108	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio.
20268	22589	Our live talk program begins now.
24529	25730	Boring!
30031	31151	This video sucks!
35413	38756	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
39376	42018	Orange Lounge may contain nudity.
42038	45921	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
46321	49563	Hide Orange Lounge radio for the fucking children.
50324	53086	The last Metroid is in captivity.
54226	56268	The galaxy is at peace.
69324	72606	I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.
73087	75908	My kind of people, and assholes.
76689	81332	One... ...Ranma... ...is good.
81772	83313	Mashed it by that much.
83673	85114	That's Dr. Evil's cat.
85434	86115	How can you tell?
86395	87536	I never forget a pussy.
88243	90445	I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
114990	116791	I hate nature!
117032	119774	I just wish the world would explode, and then I could take over hell.
120674	122075	Do I look like the weather girl?
122255	123056	Everything alright?
123076	124557	Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.
127578	133182	We are live and this is episode number 16 for October the 20th, 2002.
133982	138645	You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most extreme radio station of all things Bimani.
139166	141227	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
141787	146771	DarkSakura, my lovely co-host, is stuck in a bit of traffic right now just outside of San Francisco.
146831	151674	She gave me a call about 6 o'clock and she was stuck right before the bridge in San Francisco.
151754	154355	She, by the way, this weekend went to YowieCon.
155176	156477	For those that don't know what Yowie is...
157532	158192	I'm not going to tell you.
181019	183823	Uh, filling in for Jamie tonight, we have some guests here in studio.
183863	186467	Please say hello to the man with the perfect attendance record.
186527	187549	It is Loki.
188169	188530	Hello.
189752	193978	And of course, almost with the perfect attendance record, I think you're pretty close, say hello to Dave.
194719	195119	Hello.
195953	198555	And I think we have a couple more folks coming later, too, so that'll be good.
199076	200257	We'll be talking to everybody a bit later.
200357	209004	First, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to start it off with a song that I know has become one of Loki's favorite songs now, because he got to prove everybody right on something.
209364	212587	We're going to start this off with a song from 2DX8Style.
213607	215269	It's called Sakura.
215609	216850	And do you want to say anything about Sakura?
217751	218451	I was right.
219012	220733	And we'll get in more to that later.
220813	221934	Oh, and look who just walked in the door.
221954	222735	It's some more guests.
223035	223836	Everybody say hello to Brad.
226258	227559	Okay, Jamie did that a week ago.
227579	229041	That was so last week, Brad.
229481	230022	Just kidding.
230482	232484	And everybody say hello to the rice princess, Irene.
233144	233765	Hi.
234706	235767	Oh, you guys sound so thrilled.
237028	237548	Oh, you're tired.
237568	238189	I'm sorry to hear that.
238569	245756	Okay, so we're going to start this off with something from 2DX8 style and just maybe, just maybe from the new Dance Dance Revolution.
246717	247297	Extreme.
248799	252282	This is Revenge with Sakura here on Orange Lounge Radio.
356329	357089	Oh, yeah.
358030	358790	And you don't stop.
359150	360030	Come on.
428086	431341	Like Jazz and Hip Hop, it makes your body and soul a future goal
464738	466220	Thanks for watching!
536691	539048	And now DJ Lissa, rocking it, rocking it, rocking it
604594	605415	Thank you for watching!
682692	683794	Thank you for watching!
747797	750999	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
751739	753280	Orange Lounge Radio.
756622	759903	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
760824	762985	And Dave's sitting there over the corner doing the little dance.
763905	764486	It's fun.
765986	766487	What is this?
766927	768147	You never heard the catch-up song?
769128	770409	After the show, I'll show you the video.
770489	774170	It's these little Latina hoochies doing these little dance.
774451	777112	It's like they're all labeling it the new Macarena.
778411	781873	So if there's ever a Disney's Mix 2, you know, we're going to have the ketchup song.
781893	783814	Because we had the Macarena in the first one.
784175	785095	Oh, happy day.
786176	787477	My thoughts exactly.
789894	799897	I want to take a minute at the very top of the show here to recognize my other show that I've been participating in for the last 20 months, understudationlive.org.
799937	807640	And for those that didn't hear, the show came to an end, I believe, two weeks ago was the last show because Live 365 was off this past week.
807680	811241	And unfortunately, there were some circumstances that developed which caused our program to go off of air.
811621	812422	www.DarkSakura.com
842261	849325	Revival, when he's over, he's out there in Texas, he moved out to Texas, he might do something with some new co-hosts, and I definitely would support him in doing something like that.
849846	852367	So, big thanks to everybody at understationlive.org.
853428	865815	Now, back to Orange Lounge Radio, here we are, we're back from break last week, we were also breaking last week, breaking what, I don't know, oh, breaking all-time low listening records for our tape show, that's for sure.
867617	869018	No, actually, it was fine.
870519	871680	What did you think of that show, Brad?
871700	872861	It was interesting, wasn't it?
873541	874382	Did you hear the show?
874742	876783	Yeah, I had to dump the whole tape and edit it together.
876803	877344	I heard the show.
878064	883328	It was... We always tend to get a very mixed reaction from the chat room when we do those tapes.
883348	885029	That was the second time we taped a show in advance.
885049	886270	So that one was the one from Scandia?
886290	888571	That was the Scandia one we taped a couple weeks ago.
888912	891493	My opinion is the Golfland one was better.
891814	892794	Because you were on it, right?
892934	893695	No, I wasn't on either one.
893715	894956	I thought you were on the Golfland one.
894976	895656	No, I wasn't.
895996	896857	That was Ted...
898088	905111	No, it was better because when you went downstairs to play Hip Hop Mania, and the person was like, what are you doing here?
905131	906792	That's true.
907753	915676	Keith, the wonderful, wonderful arcade technician over at Scandia that's hooking the place up with 2DX8 style, hopefully soon too, if Channel Beat...
916317	916737	Hey you guys!
916757	919499	Yeah, gee, I can't figure out who that is.
937299	938140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
963456	967078	Isn't it basically like gay anime?
967718	969539	Like male gay anime with pretty boys?
970679	971039	Fair enough.
971079	972300	Oh, Loki wants to contribute something.
973220	976162	I thought it was gay anime porn, from what I've heard.
976522	979363	From what I understand, it's not really porn.
979383	980544	It's all implied.
981693	983434	It's all like implied porn, you know.
983774	987856	I don't know how you imply porno, but just like a Skinamax film.
988216	991377	It's like a gay Skinamax film, but it's animated in a Japanese style.
991938	994059	I'm glad that I never heard of this before.
994279	994599	Anyway.
995868	996609	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1021452	1023876	No, it's for real.
1023896	1024557	It's not a joke.
1024617	1025158	This is for real.
1025178	1025779	Oh, you're serious?
1025799	1026580	Yes, I'm serious.
1027304	1032588	That was like the very first time I ever played DDR was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention.
1033088	1034049	And Irene was there.
1034089	1034509	Irene was there.
1034529	1035109	Irene knows about this.
1035129	1037731	I have to tell you about the actual convention the first day.
1038231	1043095	It was Rocky Horror Picture in one door, and right next door, the gun show.
1043115	1043755	The gun show.
1043775	1044796	With a bunch of hicks.
1045296	1047818	And they hated Asian people, and I was so scared.
1047858	1048598	I was like, oh my god.
1048638	1054262	It was a bunch of card-carrying NRA members mixed in with guys dressed in drag, doing the whole Frankenfurter thing.
1054282	1056183	If you've ever seen Rocky Horror, you know what I'm talking about.
1056223	1056664	If you haven't...
1057364	1057745	You should.
1057805	1058165	It's fun.
1058545	1059026	Where you been?
1059046	1059586	Where you been?
1059867	1060227	Wake up.
1060267	1060828	Go outside.
1061148	1061929	Stop playing DDR.
1061949	1062730	Put the controller down.
1063651	1064231	It was scary.
1064512	1064832	Okay, bye.
1066414	1079942	You know, one thing that Travis, the host over at UnderStationLive.org recommended to me was that we should take, now that that show is going to be gone, we should take some of that and bring it to Orange Lounge and just get really random on that show.
1079962	1083904	Because you know UnderStationLive was supposed to be a Rocky Horror show, and in the beginning it was.
1083944	1085345	It was just like we are with Bomani.
1085865	1088667	Nothing but Rocky Horror for two hours, and then it just turned into Radio Hell.
1090668	1091989	But it hasn't always been Radio Hell.
1092029	1092309	Yeah.
1094570	1094910	What do you want?
1095551	1095971	Okay, here.
1097065	1098305	Thank you for calling, how may I direct your call?
1098325	1100546	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio
1123948	1130232	It's kind of, I guess the word would be ironic that we're talking about how sooner or later we'll get off topic.
1130452	1132753	And while talking about this, we're getting off topic.
1133894	1135154	Nah, fuck DDR, it's old.
1135174	1136215	What was that?
1136715	1137556	We had a topic?
1140938	1143299	Yeah, where are all the donuts, Rob?
1143319	1144119	You have to go get them.
1144620	1145120	We're poor!
1146252	1150353	I can give money if you want to go get donuts, but we have a show to do.
1150373	1151353	You can't get donuts now.
1151373	1151914	What show?
1152354	1152874	This show.
1153074	1153694	That's an old joke.
1154394	1154754	Old joke.
1155155	1157535	Surprise, we're on the internet and we've got that many people listening.
1157595	1158055	Oh my god.
1159236	1159476	Enough.
1160236	1161756	We don't talk about our statistics over there.
1161876	1161996	So!
1162016	1165958	What do I want to talk about?
1165978	1167198	There's so much going on.
1167238	1169298	I said first we'd talk about... Gun shows.
1169318	1170039	This was big news.
1170199	1171159	This is actually a follow-up.
1172759	1173460	Yes, Brad, gun shows.
1173480	1174480	This is a follow-up to...
1175427	1175687	www.cagames.com
1193368	1194249	Then you should burn this.
1194289	1198696	This is the Feat of Fury, which is this new release of a DDR simulator.
1198716	1201339	I'm not sure if you'd want to call it a simulator, a clone.
1201780	1202842	It's not an emulator.
1203222	1206026	I always get criticized on this because I call things emulators to be simulators.
1206046	1207849	What would you categorize this as, Loki?
1209221	1212464	It's just another game that's similar to DDR.
1212504	1214926	It's basically like Dance Magic Mode from Disney's Rave.
1215387	1226296	And it just so happens to support the DWI format, sort of, because it doesn't have tempo changes, tempo stops, freeze arrows, or 12th notes.
1226396	1231181	So it's kind of third mix down.
1232256	1234997	It's basically DDR first mix type level.
1235037	1242419	I mean, the simulator hasn't quite progressed, you know, obviously to that level of being on the same caliber as DDR Max.
1242479	1243879	It's an early beta release.
1244500	1246340	They're not done with everything I wanted to do yet.
1246560	1248701	So it's an early beta that got released, but you can download this.
1248761	1250761	It's got about, what, seven songs on it that you can play.
1251522	1255323	All by the same guy, I notice, but that'll probably change with future versions.
1255343	1256323	There's some decent stuff in there.
1256343	1258364	I'm going to play one of the songs from Feet of Fury a little later.
1259184	1259604	And, uh...
1261082	1262102	Some good stuff.
1262363	1264083	It's just like Dance Magic, as you said.
1264143	1269725	It's kind of like Street Fighter meets DDR, if you can imagine that, because you've got your characters that you pick and all this stuff.
1270085	1272266	But I know everybody got a chance to test it for the show.
1272286	1273666	I was just kind of wondering what you guys thought.
1274066	1274526	I'll start.
1275127	1276307	I know it's an early beta.
1276647	1277708	I think it's an early beta.
1277808	1278708	It's damn impressive.
1278748	1281829	I mean, it's kind of like what I'd call a DDR first mix.
1282429	1285110	As far as DDR goes, it's got a long way to go to catch up.
1285610	1287031	But, I mean, it's still a first release.
1287071	1288472	It's early, but it looks good.
1288512	1293455	I mean, a lot of Dreamcast homebrewing stuff isn't that great, but Feet of Fury is coming along very nicely.
1293495	1296857	I love the idea that it's going to support your own stuff, your own DWIs and things.
1297477	1304701	I kind of wish there was a mode that wasn't Dance Magic, like you could play in a normal mode, but I kind of think that all that stuff is coming.
1304721	1308103	They just want to get the initial stuff out the gate, and then they'll kind of add on to it.
1308123	1312826	All that Freeze Arrows and Twelfth Nose, they'll probably come on to it later, but they've got to get their basic engine established first.
1313166	1314487	Yeah, for smart, they'll do that.
1315107	1316589	What do you guys think?
1316649	1320653	I think if you've got a Dreamcast and a burner, there's no reason you shouldn't be going and downloading this right now and playing it.
1320713	1321333	It's pretty cool.
1323055	1323515	Yes, Brad.
1325638	1328879	Okay, I understand, it's a beta and all, and I guess, you know, this is great.
1330279	1333700	Star, you know, this could be, there's some possibilities and things with this.
1334320	1337360	But, uh, who was the graphic designer on this thing, man?
1337600	1338180	I have no idea.
1338400	1340461	Some big Star Trek geek or something?
1340481	1341581	Because what are the arrows?
1341641	1344242	The arrows are the shape of... Are they?
1344322	1346982	Just make the arrows the shape of the normal arrows in DDR.
1347022	1351603	Well, that's the thing, is that you don't want to copy DDR, because they're probably afraid of a lawsuit.
1352358	1359063	Well, you know what, though, that if you ever play True Kiss Destination DDR, those arrows, see, those arrows look a hell of a lot like those arrows.
1359103	1360104	I kind of noticed that.
1361145	1371233	Well, on the topic of those arrows, you know, it's nice to have different arrows, but you can't tell the difference between, you know, different notes, like 4th notes, you know, 8th, 16th.
1371753	1377337	I mean, they have a slight color change to them, but otherwise they're just looking like these shiny Star Trek circles.
1377357	1379439	Yeah, why don't we just make them big circles, all of them?
1379559	1380400	They can all be circles.
1381508	1381929	There you go.
1381949	1383873	That would be easy to dance her, so we can't do that.
1387276	1393000	No, but I think that as far as it goes of actual playing quality, it's not that bad.
1393601	1407971	But, like the arrows, it's really weird because they're one of the modifiers, especially, makes all the arrows spin around in place, kind of like, I forget what it is on Step Mania, do you know what the... Dizzy.
1408031	1412254	Dizzy mode, where all of them spin around while going up, even though they're in the same column.
1413175	1419877	And with arrows that long, they kind of overlap, so you can't tell which note is which.
1419937	1421838	Well, right, but I mean, it's not supposed to be easy.
1422999	1425840	Yeah, but it's not supposed to be impossible to read.
1425860	1426620	Yeah, true, true.
1427595	1431558	And also another thing I noticed is it's way too easy to get perfects.
1431918	1436541	That blink thing was the most annoying one where half the arrows would disappear at a time, they'd fade in and out.
1436621	1437902	You'd be able to see half of them.
1438122	1438983	That was really hard to see.
1439263	1442485	I didn't quite get how the gameplay of the game went.
1442525	1447989	Of course, maybe that's my own fault because I didn't read a manual, but hopefully they'll do a built-in tutorial later on in the game.
1448009	1450330	I don't think there's any story mode or anything.
1450550	1451231	It didn't look like...
1451491	1456039	Well, I don't know, like they have in, um, Puzzle, uh, Tetris, or whatever it's called.
1456360	1457101	Puzzle Fighter?
1457362	1460027	No, um... God, what's a game?
1460287	1460888	God, shit!
1460928	1461589	Puzzle Bobble?
1461890	1463453	No, it's on Super Nintendo.
1463473	1464074	Bustamoo?
1464414	1464635	Super...
1465393	1466074	Final Fantasy?
1466514	1467095	No!
1468257	1471381	Anyways, here's basically what the concept of the game is.
1471481	1472562	Okay, you pick a character.
1472642	1475766	Each character has a different kind of attack or modifier that they do.
1476227	1479992	For instance, you know, one will have Blink, one will have Dizzy, whatever.
1480712	1481173	And so...
1483673	1484313	No, I don't think.
1484473	1486994	Like Yoshi, Tetris, or Yoshi?
1487795	1488735	No, dammit!
1489515	1489976	Forget it!
1490116	1490656	Who cares?
1490756	1491256	Dammit!
1491556	1496599	Anyway, so basically you pick a character, and then they have different modifiers that they attack with or whatever.
1497079	1501962	So as you're going along, you have a little bar that's kind of in the middle, and as soon as that builds up, now you can do one of two things.
1502102	1510886	Either you can set to auto, where once it builds up all the way along, it'll automatically unleash the attack, or you can set to manual, to where when it builds up, you can attack whenever.
1511406	1513027	Yeah, with the modifier or something.
1513807	1514347	That's nice.
1514387	1517448	What I like to do during that is just punch my neighbor, whoever's playing against me.
1519109	1520450	When it fills up or not, whenever.
1521050	1521730	Whenever I feel like it.
1523031	1524191	It's more effective.
1524351	1525932	Oh, I look like a raccoon!
1528253	1529633	I don't think they could hear you on the mic.
1530533	1532074	It's for the best that they couldn't hear me.
1533074	1534495	Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.
1534515	1535375	Tetris Attack?
1537970	1538310	Yes!
1538750	1541731	How'd that feel when I smashed the microphone against your hand?
1542531	1544592	You know, I said Tetris Attack earlier.
1544912	1552114	Or the uber awesome, and I'm sorry, fuck all y'all, this game rules, Pokemon Puzzle League.
1552194	1552574	Fuck you!
1552594	1553954	Oh, you mean Yoshi's Cookie?
1554234	1556275	No, I mean Pokemon Puzzle League.
1556695	1559976	It was never released on Super Nintendo, it doesn't exist, it was always Pokemon.
1560606	1561367	Yoshi's Cookie
1573032	1574274	What the hell are you doing?
1575075	1576537	We're making bad radio.
1576977	1578840	No, we're doing Kentucky Fried Movie.
1579341	1579741	Anyways.
1579781	1581383	For all our listeners who can't see.
1582345	1590536	So, yeah, they're supposed to add a step editor, and I haven't tried to actually make a swap CD, but you can do that too, and I don't know.
1590936	1608400	I'm being told a few things by Twen in the chatroom, who is kind of the person who alerted us to this game in the first place, saying that the creator has stated that a main mode will be in the final version, cool, that's good to hear, and not only will you be able to put in your own DWIs and stuff, you'll be able to have your own graphic themes.
1608740	1611821	So if you want to change the arrows, go to town.
1612681	1615562	I wasn't waving, I was going like, way, yay, wow.
1615922	1617502	I thought you were waving because you wanted to talk, I'm sorry.
1619775	1626241	But anyways... What other kinds of modes would you be looking forward to to see in a later version of Feat of Fury?
1626501	1627301	I don't really know.
1627742	1630084	That just means I have to buy Dreamcast pads now.
1630344	1632266	Screw that, I'm just sticking with my PC.
1633086	1641334	Actually, what I was planning to do since I'm, you know, like that, I was going to rip the songs out of that sim and put it on my sim, but, you know, that's just me.
1641754	1642254	Did you say rip?
1642655	1644216	Yeah, I said rip.
1644917	1645457	Shh, keep it quiet.
1645697	1645998	Shh.
1647867	1650569	I'm going to go ahead and play one of those songs from Feet of Fury real fast.
1650629	1651730	I'm just going to play this one song.
1651750	1656094	We're not going to go into a full break, but I thought you guys would want to hear the music that goes into it.
1656174	1659957	And this is created by a guy who did all the songs in the first release of Feet of Fury, by the way.
1660638	1661399	Roddy Toomin.
1661779	1662420	Toomin Mim?
1662620	1663240	Toomin Mim?
1663360	1663701	I don't know.
1664121	1667003	Also known as, and if he's listening, he's going to kill me for butchering his name.
1667384	1668685	Also known as DJ Geki.
1669466	1672188	This is my favorite, and the CD looks like a giant happy face.
1672228	1673549	This happens to be my favorite song in the game.
1674150	1675431	This is Tisanitis.
1676132	1681150	And I'm going to play this for you guys so you can sample some of the music from Feet of Fury right here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1817026	1821308	Alright, if you're just joining us, that was Titsanitis from Feet of Fear.
1821408	1823109	I can't pronounce these damn names.
1823209	1823950	Titsanasis.
1824310	1825410	Titsanasis.
1826191	1827512	Titsanitis, I have a cream for that.
1827532	1832894	This is why I'm on the internet radio and not normal radio, along with the rest of you, might I add.
1835916	1841837	I was from Feet of Fury, which is a brand new Dreamcast DDR clone type game.
1842057	1846218	I don't know what the official label of it would be, but dance magic type things.
1846738	1847378	You guys.
1848579	1852279	Some very interesting comments were made during that song in the room here.
1852900	1855300	Basically talking how much of an old school video game that sounds like.
1855340	1857721	It's like level four of Blaster Master or something.
1858261	1858381	Hey.
1860041	1862802	In defense of Blaster Master, it had better music than that.
1863162	1864542	Blaster Master is the shit.
1864862	1870803	Irene, I know you had some pretty interesting opinions, so why don't you share with everyone else listening?
1873304	1874424	Oh man, yeah.
1875324	1876385	My plumbing was clogged.
1876825	1878105	Anyway, hold on.
1878705	1881626	Brad is the most immature person I know.
1883626	1885247	And he's like four years older than you are.
1888402	1890083	Oh, um, Feet of Fury, is that what it's called?
1890103	1890983	Yes, Feet of Fury.
1891683	1892483	Why do you think it sucks?
1892623	1893063	It's free!
1893123	1893784	I don't care!
1893804	1895164	But the best games in life are free!
1895204	1900246	Yeah, well, if you already have, like, third mix, fourth mix, whatever, on PlayStation, that's free.
1900666	1907468	You know, I mean, this is, it's already been done on Disney's Rave, and I think it's just kind of cheesy, and, like, the music doesn't fit well, it doesn't dance...
1907948	1909310	I mean, I couldn't dance to it.
1909391	1913296	If I saw it, I wouldn't want to get it.
1913416	1919766	Now, do you think if Loki performed some sexual favors over there and got some of his songs on the FOF, it might be a little better?
1921503	1923584	It might be a little better, but I still wouldn't play it.
1925205	1931048	I mean, I don't know, like, you know, not because of his music, but because the whole scheme of it just sucks.
1931268	1937731	I don't know, like, if he were to put his music on a Max scheme or something like that, or Disney's Rave, yeah, sure, I'd play it.
1937771	1940972	So you just want to play a copy of DDR, basically, with new songs?
1941542	1943703	Well, not even just a copy, just DDR.
1943743	1948646	I mean, this is not, if you're going to even call this a knockoff of DDR, it's not very well done.
1949307	1949667	I don't know.
1949747	1952108	Even if it is preliminary, it's just, it kind of sucks.
1952529	1952969	I don't like it.
1953209	1954190	Fair enough.
1954910	1955831	Can't please everybody.
1956011	1956511	That's fine.
1956891	1959893	We're about a variety of opinion here on Orange Launch Radio.
1960093	1960934	You suck, Irene.
1960954	1961374	I hate you.
1961534	1962735	You can never please women.
1964215	1964676	That's right.
1964696	1965656	You can never please a woman.
1965676	1966637	No, you can't, Robyn.
1968314	1968734	It's okay.
1968934	1969415	I don't need to.
1982731	1985852	No, I think Two Panel would be better, because it's like, just running.
1986712	1987712	It's like Dropout.
1988512	1989853	Oh, let's just play Boom Boom Dollar.
1989873	1992233	That's over left, left, right, right, left, right, left, right.
1992253	1996755	Well, let's see, let's just play, let's see, Mickey Mouse March from Disney's Ring.
1996775	1998475	That is left and right.
1998515	1999175	Yep, yep.
2000756	2003696	I don't know, I still, I still, I like Feet of Fury.
2003736	2005597	I mean, it's not something I'm going to play every day.
2005917	2008478	It's just kind of something you look at and go, yeah, it's pretty cool.
2008538	2010058	I wonder what the next one's going to look like, and...
2011013	2013754	You can look at them, not me, because I'm not going to play it.
2014595	2015435	Well, you're a bitch.
2015895	2016635	I'm just kidding.
2016655	2017936	Fuck you!
2019376	2020217	You're going to die.
2022218	2023138	You know I speak the truth.
2023198	2023678	It's all good.
2023698	2024298	It's all good.
2024679	2025699	You speak the truth.
2025719	2026259	You're a bitch.
2026359	2026900	Oh, thanks.
2028100	2029020	I love you, Eileen.
2029040	2031121	You know that.
2031681	2033222	Now her bar got full and she punched me.
2042014	2049499	I suggest we're going to take a quick break, because I need to go to potty, and I've got people yelling at me left and right to play to the channel.
2049519	2051020	Are you guys destroying things back there?
2051040	2051801	What the hell's going on?
2052141	2055283	Dave had a little too much to drink, so he's... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.
2056183	2058705	Didn't you have a birthday recently, Dave, or am I confusing you with someone else?
2058725	2059986	Who are you talking to, Rob?
2060006	2060606	Did Dave leave?
2060746	2061006	Yes.
2061186	2062187	Oh, never mind.
2062547	2065169	That's why you have to look at the computer screen all the time.
2065909	2066970	Do-do-do-do-do.
2067936	2069776	Get out of your house, Rob.
2070597	2075318	Get off your tail and go... Okay, I'm going to put on some songs.
2075358	2076418	We're going to take a quick break.
2077098	2084180	We'll be right back and we're going to talk about Dance Dance Revolution USA and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
2085120	2086040	So we'll be right back.
2086100	2088120	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2161361	2162205	Thanks for watching!
2205736	2207284	Let's go, let's go, let's go!
2288481	2294171	Satellite control, zero, minus one hour and fifteen seconds.
2485241	2485721	Warning.
2486382	2493085	Orange Lounge Radio's Pomani Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
2493105	2503691	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tile, and start stomping away.
2504691	2508113	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
2509093	2510613	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2510633	2513114	It's episode number... Whoa, and my cell phone's going off.
2513294	2514534	Hey, this is Jamie right now.
2514554	2516555	Let's see if I can pick her up on speakerphone.
2516575	2517055	Hold on a minute.
2517755	2518775	Let me see if I can take her on speakerphone.
2518795	2519355	Jamie, are you there?
2520156	2520676	Hello, Jamie?
2522136	2524697	I have a minute or two to show.
2524717	2525757	We're on live right now.
2525937	2526397	Say hello.
2527377	2528318	Hi, everybody.
2528738	2529438	What's going on, Jamie?
2529458	2530298	You want to talk to our listeners?
2531878	2532659	I can barely hear.
2532679	2533179	I'm sorry.
2533359	2534119	I'm in a restaurant.
2534399	2534779	Oh, okay.
2535439	2536380	We're hungry.
2537040	2537660	Well, what's going on?
2537680	2538020	I'm sorry.
2540447	2540967	That's okay.
2540987	2542348	You want to say anything to our listeners?
2543589	2543969	What?
2544609	2545950	Do you want to say anything to our listeners?
2547851	2549952	I just wanted to make sure everything was going okay.
2550853	2551933	Everything's going great.
2553454	2554235	You're cutting out on me.
2554535	2555335	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
2555375	2556035	You want to say anything?
2556276	2557796	We've been talking about Feet of Fury.
2557957	2558737	Have you played that yet?
2559958	2560918	I still can't hear you.
2561558	2562759	We've been talking about Feet of Fury.
2562799	2563419	Have you played that yet?
2565504	2567766	It's breaking up, I'm sorry.
2568406	2569707	All right, I'll talk to you later, Jamie.
2569967	2570647	Bye.
2573109	2575270	Now you know why we can't take phone calls on this show.
2575691	2577252	Well, we need to patch in an actual phone line.
2577452	2581815	Yeah, we need to patch in an actual phone line, and at some point we'll be able to take phone calls.
2581855	2589740	But that was my cell phone on the speakerphone, and she couldn't hear me because I guess we get really shitty reception in this room here.
2591961	2594343	Irene, you were telling a funny little story during the break.
2594363	2595043	You don't want to talk about it?
2595914	2597556	Alright, we'll talk about it later.
2597616	2598738	It's orange on business.
2598958	2600180	Oh, it's orange on business.
2601662	2603484	See, and you were listening, but that's okay.
2603925	2604306	That's fine.
2605828	2606348	I didn't think so.
2607990	2615353	Okay, so unfortunately, it sounds like Jamie and them stopped to eat, so I don't think there's any way in hell she's going to make it back in time, so... Maybe they're at Dairy Queen right across the street.
2615373	2616153	Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?
2616173	2618974	Why don't you tell everyone where I live, Brad?
2620795	2623456	There isn't a thousand or a million fucking Dairy Queens.
2623476	2626177	Well, in Sacramento, there's only like, you know... Fifty.
2626578	2628558	Just kidding, I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you, I don't care.
2631239	2632240	Yeah, so, Feet of Fury...
2633197	2634058	Any last thoughts on that?
2634478	2636020	I know you guys were saying some more during the break.
2638242	2645949	Just a quick reminder, if you are going to burn it, make sure you have the newest copy of Nero or whatever, the burning software, because I burned one.
2646533	2647874	with an older copy of Nero.
2663283	2666326	Those bastards, they made me lose a CD.
2666967	2667928	Me too, I lost two of them.
2668349	2675256	But if you want to check it out, form your own opinion on the game, kind of got a mixed reaction here so far, check it out at http://www.cagames.com
2679574	2707798	Cool, so moving right along, I should plug our chat room, we haven't plugged that at all tonight You're just going to join any other side IRC server like karma.othersideirc.net or irc.egheads.org And you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge And that's the same server, by the way, that hosts a lot of the other big Bomani sites So if you're in one of the Bomani chat rooms right now, chances are you're on the same server as Orange Lounge Just type to join the Channel Orange Lounge Brad, why are you taking your clothes off?
2708513	2710033	We're not ready for that point of the show yet.
2713014	2713414	Woo-hoo.
2715795	2716115	Anyway.
2717275	2719536	Let's talk about, uh, I don't know.
2719716	2721056	Let's talk about sex, baby.
2721276	2721837	How was your guys' week?
2721877	2724097	It's been about two weeks since we've all been kind of sitting here together.
2724157	2724657	How was your guys' week?
2724677	2725838	Did you do anything exciting?
2726638	2728758	Any Bomani news or non-Bomani news?
2728798	2729158	I don't care.
2730499	2732599	Um, I finished my site.
2733420	2734760	Oh, you tell everybody about your site.
2735330	2736452	Yes, yes, yes.
2736952	2738715	My DDR site.
2739236	2744003	Thanks to Twin for registering a domain name that kind of got me started on actually finishing my site.
2744583	2748048	It's leechfromloki.tk.
2748769	2750332	That's right, leechfromloki.
2751571	2753873	and it's got a pretty cool interface.
2754093	2756335	All that's up there right now is just two of my originals.
2756555	2759897	I've got one for Fire in the Dark and one for the Quay 2 theme.
2760438	2762959	It's kind of like some hard rock kind of stuff, I guess.
2763940	2765181	I like the layout of the site, by the way.
2765201	2766622	You've got that Never Look Back thing going on.
2766702	2767243	It's pretty cool.
2767283	2768383	I have the Never Look Back...
2769484	2773447	G2 Arts thing is kind of my background there, and it's a pretty strange interface.
2773527	2774207	It's kind of cool.
2774928	2778410	And so I have tons of web space.
2778470	2784515	I've got like 50 megs for stuff right now, and they didn't really say in the disclaimer that I couldn't have more than one site.
2784655	2789658	So I guess really I have unlimited web space and unlimited bandwidth, so that's kind of cool.
2789678	2794261	And then maybe later on forums will be coming up because I also have the capability to do that.
2794441	2796883	And so, yeah, it'll be fun.
2797383	2798184	We can meet...
2798686	2801629	We need orange lounge forms, so you might have to work that in for us.
2801709	2802209	I could do that.
2802409	2803731	Yeah, alright, good deal, good deal.
2804211	2805792	Can I give an update on my site?
2806013	2806293	Yes.
2806553	2806693	It's 2020.
2807234	2813559	Oh, God.
2813860	2814680	God, you suck.
2815501	2817183	Just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2817463	2818924	You're going to attack her.
2819044	2819845	Attack me first.
2820145	2820345	Okay.
2820646	2821306	That's my joke.
2821346	2822047	Brad, you suck.
2822207	2822467	Thank you.
2823168	2823889	Okay, now you can attack her.
2828310	2828970	Oh, dear God.
2829511	2842394	Oh, by the way, for those that have been bitching about how bad the Orange Lounge site has been looking, because it's really old, SoCalKicks, by the way, one of our early listeners, being one of those people that always bitched about how bad it looked, I said, fine, SoCalKicks, you do a new site.
2842854	2843495	So he said, okay.
2844095	2847156	So he's supposed to be working on that for us, so we'll have a new site soon.
2847956	2848736	That's all I can tell you.
2853738	2854298	Let's see.
2857190	2858511	Let's talk about Max USA.
2858971	2859952	DDR Max USA.
2860072	2860232	What?
2860873	2861653	Yes, Max USA.
2861853	2863394	Oh, you mean the one that's off by a measure?
2863915	2864575	Well, no, no, no.
2865556	2866196	Actually, okay.
2866797	2869379	Last time, we were here in the room talking.
2869439	2874142	They had released the demo on the official PlayStation magazine, and two of the songs were off by a complete measure.
2874202	2879085	However, from what I understand, they released a new demo to GameStops across America.
2879185	2883929	I believe Jamie said she has one, because her fiancé is a manager of a GameStop.
2884589	2886151	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
2902268	2906809	What's kind of assumed to be pretty damn close to the actual list going on?
2907210	2910151	I don't know if you want to elaborate on that, Loki, because you look at more of that stuff than I do.
2911631	2913272	What they did is they kind of got another list.
2913332	2914732	It's pretty similar to the last one.
2914752	2918473	A lot of things people were saying before is, there's not going to be ghosts, there's not going to be Kakumei.
2918913	2920054	You guys are wrong.
2920394	2923395	So on this list there isn't ghosts or Kakumei because it's...
2924455	2929840	More of an update, which is kind of strange because you'd think, well, gee, you know, this list got leaked out before.
2929960	2932101	Let's not put it in when we fix the demo this time.
2932462	2938386	Oh, well, you know what I bet, though, because that demo only came out about, what, a week after the list was leaked, right?
2938727	2942089	But they probably have to do those demos to get them burned in mass and everything.
2942450	2944431	That demo was probably done about six weeks ago.
2945032	2945172	So...
2946383	2946903	Whatever.
2947204	2948085	That doesn't matter.
2948565	2959614	Anyways, one of the things that was kind of strange about it, though, is it had some newer songs on there, but those songs are the same ones from Dancing Stage Party Mix, which is kind of strange.
2960535	2966040	I mean, we might see them in DDR Max USA, but I kind of doubt it.
2966120	2967061	I'm not really sure, but...
2967600	2968300	I doubt it, too.
2968480	2972642	The way they were in the list, they were completely out of alphabetical order from the rest.
2972662	2974003	It was kind of weird.
2974163	2975944	But the list wasn't alphabetical in the first place.
2975984	2978005	The guy put them in alphabetical order.
2978285	2979065	Oh, I didn't realize that.
2979125	2979585	I'm sorry.
2979786	2981886	So that has nothing to do with it.
2982107	2982747	It's still kind of weird.
2983067	2987989	Oh, man, when I saw when a man loves a woman on there, I was like, that cannot be in the game.
2988089	2988529	Come on.
2989710	2991031	Yeah, but what about Be In My Paradise?
2991711	2992111	I'm just kidding.
2992131	2994992	Be In My Paradise isn't in there, either.
2995012	2995553	I don't think.
2995973	2996293	Was it?
2998604	3001506	Anyways, um... You remember that old game, Impossible Mission, on Commodore 64?
3001687	3004149	That's what you sound like right now, when you fall off the edge.
3004169	3004869	Ah!
3008072	3008192	Ah!
3008292	3009013	Stay a while.
3009253	3010254	Stay forever.
3010414	3011795	Get him, my robots.
3012676	3013156	Anyway, yes.
3013676	3014697	Anyway, so... Hi, world.
3017159	3026187	So, anyways, um... Some of the things that were on there, though, like, that they mentioned, that were also in Density's Party Mix, was, uh... The Bad Touch...
3027657	3030279	You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
3051290	3060556	Now, I do understand that Dancing Stage Party Mix is for the PS1, so I don't know how that could be carried over to the PS2 list.
3062177	3062998	That wouldn't make any sense.
3063118	3073165	I could understand if Konomics had that stuff in there or something like that, and that didn't end up being in there because they were making Dancing Stage Party Mix at the same time.
3073185	3074806	They could have been working on the engine at the same time.
3075891	3080653	My theory as to why they're not in there is in that box art that was released about four weeks ago.
3080813	3085575	Because if... Now, one of those songs also on that list is Kylie Minogue, Can't Get You Out of My Head.
3086135	3090877	Now, if that were actually in the game, I would think that would be the first name that would be on that cover.
3090897	3094478	Because she's a multi-platinum-selling worldwide artist.
3094918	3097099	Certainly more well-known than Darude, I would think.
3097720	3100961	I think her name would have been on there at the top billing, so I don't think that song's in there.
3100981	3102882	And I think it kind of voids out all the Euromix ones.
3102942	3103862	But that's just my theory.
3104631	3109492	Don't you think the representatives of Kylie Minogue would want you to put that kind of a thing on the cover?
3109873	3112573	Saying, oh, featuring Kylie Minogue, blah blah blah Featuring Kylie Minogue's breasts
3136377	3137158	I was walking down the street and...
3164847	3165227	You know what?
3165347	3167229	Honestly, I have a confession to make, guys.
3167649	3167849	What?
3168729	3171291	I haven't... Don't worry, sweetie.
3171851	3172752	It's not what you think.
3173192	3175654	No, um... I haven't played DDR in over a week.
3177575	3178195	Yeah, yeah.
3178876	3180296	Play a GaspWave file.
3180737	3181177	You have one?
3181457	3181697	No?
3181777	3182058	Okay.
3183538	3185640	Hey, Rob, get your head out of your ass.
3186260	3187961	Sorry, I'm being given some information.
3187981	3189182	I have to see if I can give it out or not.
3191226	3191846	What were you saying?
3192527	3195428	I can't say it because I don't know if I can give it out or not.
3195468	3196288	No, I can.
3196589	3200050	Basically, being told, okay, so maybe I'm wrong then with this news.
3200330	3202391	They're saying the box art is outdated.
3202892	3205373	The yellow burst on the cover isn't really there.
3205453	3207174	It was just there for the online version.
3207234	3208894	It's not on the real box art.
3209735	3213157	So, okay, so maybe they changed it.
3213497	3214477	But I still don't think they're there.
3214717	3215558	I still don't think they're there.
3215798	3218119	Even more important than all that, I haven't played DDR in a week.
3221044	3241808	Oh yeah, well I haven't played DDR since yesterday at home All I gotta say is, I don't care, I have it reserved, it's coming out next Tuesday I don't give a shit I think at this point, none of us really give a shit what's on it, just release the damn thing already So we can play it I'd rather be surprised, you know I already pre-ordered it too So, well, you know what is the real dilemma here?
3242148	3242408	What?
3242528	3250770	That comes out the same day Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out I'm like, shit, I can't play both I'm just gonna take the whole week off
3252950	3256913	Did you make a version where it's all DDR music in the radio of Grand Theft Auto?
3256953	3258093	Because you know they've got the radio.
3259074	3259334	Uh, no.
3259695	3260415	Anyways.
3260555	3261236	Watch, watch.
3261696	3267300	I bet you anything the exact same day those two games come out is the day we finally get 2DX in Sacramento.
3267320	3268060	I bet you anything.
3268741	3270141	It's all going to happen the same day.
3270402	3274705	I know me and probably a bunch of other people will be ripping all those songs and step files to put in.
3275025	3276206	DDR Max!
3276446	3277106	Oh my god!
3277146	3278447	You're going to blow your load!
3280929	3282129	Sorry, that's an inside room joke.
3282149	3282530	Sorry, you guys.
3283969	3288691	Yeah, anyways, you'll probably see the sim files out the same week, guaranteed.
3288711	3289751	For what, the new stuff?
3289892	3290132	Oh yeah.
3290312	3292953	Oh yeah, you guys are crazy, you have those sim files around.
3293193	3300296	I remember that they were already trying to find the arrow chart, we'll talk about Extreme a little later in the show, but they were already trying to find the arrow charts for Extreme.
3300336	3306638	I'm watching that one Japanese site that's got the Max 2 stuff, because they're the first ones to have the Max 2 arrow charts, and I'm waiting.
3307018	3307479	Just waiting.
3307499	3308119	I'm just waiting.
3308779	3313201	Alright, I actually want to play for you an MP3 of one of the new...
3314053	3315274	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3343743	3345104	You guys are so wrong.
3346244	3346644	I hate you.
3347045	3349466	What were you doing last night, Rob, when I tried to call?
3349786	3355109	I just want you to wait for the all caps line yelling at you guys right here in about two seconds.
3355889	3357890	Anyway... Oh, not all caps.
3357910	3358950	That's such rude.
3359531	3361952	Or maybe you'll do that AZN type of typing.
3361992	3366234	Anyway, if you like this MP3, you can go over to that site and get the rest of them.
3366774	3370296	It's not the actual edit that's going to be in DDR.
3370436	3372097	It is edited down to a minute and a half.
3372757	3377602	about, and from what I told, it's not the actual one, but it's kind of close, whatever that means.
3378102	3380164	So, take it or leave it, here it is.
3380744	3386790	This is... Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, and the rest of you don't.
3387270	3391174	I'm going to play from DDR Max USA, this is Venus with Just Leave Me Alone.
3411748	3412775	Thank you for watching!
3504091	3508875	Alright, you heard it here first, or you heard it here second if you were already at SoCalKicks' site.
3509175	3517762	That was Venus with, you just leave me alone, and that's going to be... And Brad, you should take that advice, just leave me alone, you fucking bastard.
3517802	3519684	You just leave me alone, guys.
3520965	3521965	I hate you so much.
3523627	3525448	Why did I invite you over here tonight?
3525528	3529211	Oh yeah, I needed more people here because Jamie wasn't going to be here.
3529892	3531313	Jamie's nice to me, you're mean.
3532651	3535412	Yes, hi, this is one of my other roommates, Neil, what's up?
3535712	3537032	Want to say hello to the Bomani world?
3537692	3542413	If you could say one thing to all the Bomani nerds out there, what are you going to tell them?
3543013	3543573	Get a life.
3543773	3544853	Thank you, I knew that was coming.
3545754	3546814	Now get out of the room, we're doing a show.
3546834	3552535	What did you guys think of that song?
3552915	3554535	Is that the first time you guys have heard that, most of you?
3555076	3555676	What did you think?
3556216	3556616	I don't care.
3559123	3560323	What was that thing you were doing?
3560363	3565284	You came out and you said, What the hell were you saying while that song was playing?
3565864	3566785	Oh, sorry, okay.
3568065	3568825	Big Jim Slade.
3569225	3569745	Okay, whatever.
3569785	3574226	Anyway, no, but it's better than the Fetus Fury songs.
3576046	3576886	Alright, fair enough.
3578427	3579687	I like Dark Black Forest better.
3579707	3583708	I think that song kicks so much ass that Dark Black Forest is going to be in DDR, but that's pretty good.
3583728	3584228	It ain't so bad.
3584268	3584928	So if you like that,
3585703	3590926	Go over to SoCalKicks.com and there's more, and maybe we'll be adding some of those to the Orange Launch playlist.
3590946	3598811	However, I'm kind of holding out to get the actual rips from the actual game, which I'm sure will be out no less than 30 minutes after the game's hit shelves, if not sooner.
3599752	3600332	So we'll see.
3600472	3601072	Damn right.
3602813	3604094	Can we do a list list tonight?
3604114	3605315	What do you want to do a list list for?
3609334	3611595	Let's do a list list for something not even related to DDR.
3611615	3612375	You guys think about it.
3612635	3612975	We'll see.
3613035	3613996	If we got time, we'll do one.
3614016	3614956	We haven't done anything.
3615056	3616716	We haven't done the FUs of the week yet.
3616816	3617096	I know.
3618017	3618677	We're still going.
3618817	3619457	Keep going.
3621057	3621678	What time is it?
3621798	3621918	It's 8.02.
3622518	3623278	We're halfway there.
3623598	3624558	You guys want to do FUs of the week?
3624598	3626159	I don't have anything else to add on Max USA.
3626179	3626939	I don't really have any.
3627845	3632887	There's really no other news on Max USA for me to report other than it's almost here.
3633328	3635789	We'll do Extreme after the next break, because there's a lot to say on that.
3636069	3639190	All I have to say is, Naoki is such a chick.
3642132	3642612	I'm sorry.
3643032	3644973	If anyone's recording the show, I want that sound clip.
3645433	3648975	He can't look any more like a woman than he does now.
3649395	3651076	What, is the sex change coming next?
3651256	3658019	I mean, that one picture that we have of him in the New Naoki Journal, where he's at the test location, they show a backshot of him.
3658399	3665663	His hair is, like, really long, and he's wearing this, like, dress suit thing that looks like a woman's... I don't even know what it is.
3665823	3667464	It's just, he looks like a chick.
3668164	3668605	It's sad.
3669825	3672386	Well, next they're going to have him in the school girl outfit, so don't worry.
3672687	3673127	Then we'll know.
3675268	3676429	Depeche Mode
3697475	3705119	Speaking of sound clips, this is going to be very random, but... I said I'd play that, so never mind.
3705399	3707120	I'm just embarrassing somebody right now, don't worry about it.
3707980	3714243	I'll tell you guys during the break.
3715604	3717304	No, it's not JB.
3717645	3720526	If they fess up in the chatroom, then I'll say on air, but if they don't...
3722384	3724486	If they don't, then I'll tell you guys during the break.
3724646	3727588	Rob, we've got some blackmail stuff for you.
3727628	3728068	No, you don't.
3728208	3728728	Yeah, we do.
3728768	3729009	What?
3730009	3733011	Life is a... Shut up!
3734352	3735013	Okay, we won't go there.
3735053	3735333	Oh, yes.
3735653	3737034	Anything else to say on Max USA?
3738515	3738795	No?
3739416	3740637	I have some rips about it.
3741177	3742738	Oh, it's coming out earlier than expected.
3742978	3743659	I don't think we mentioned that.
3743679	3744799	It's going to be out at the end of October.
3744980	3745480	Halloween week.
3746577	3750918	S is coming out, not this coming up Tuesday, but the Tuesday after, supposedly.
3751018	3752019	Anywhere that week, I guess.
3752899	3753719	I've been hearing weird things.
3754700	3757560	And I'm sure we'll be doing something very special on Orange Lounge.
3757600	3758861	Sandstorm, yay.
3759621	3762382	Yes, I cannot wait to play Sandstorm.
3762882	3764382	Sandstorm is the best ever.
3767543	3768384	You know what it's like?
3768924	3770364	It's like going to a giant rave.
3770664	3772345	I'm so fucked up.
3772905	3774586	Let's have some E and make out.
3775346	3776006	Then we can be friends.
3776621	3777783	Okay, that joke is weeks old.
3777803	3778604	We can't do that anymore.
3780967	3784271	We did hear what the last song to unlock is, supposedly.
3784391	3784832	What's that?
3784912	3785813	The Drop the Bomb one?
3785833	3786594	Drop the Bomb, yeah.
3787856	3788276	Yay.
3788356	3789037	That's the new one.
3789077	3790219	Yay for dropping bombs.
3792242	3792862	Drop the bomb.
3794677	3796359	I wish they really would drop the goddamn bomb.
3796379	3797439	That thing is so annoying.
3801803	3804605	Yeah, one of Scottie D's finest songs, Stick Around.
3805426	3810811	You know, you can see Scottie D for like half a second in the Stick Around video, right before the gerbils that make out with each other.
3811711	3815615	That is the worst video slash song ever.
3815755	3816415	I disagree.
3816455	3817216	I like that song.
3817236	3817816	I don't care.
3817836	3819698	I think you're stupid.
3821229	3824313	Well, speaking of... Okay, well, anyways, this is way off topic.
3824674	3830722	There's that song that's in Guitar Freak's 8th mix, or whatever, that's, um, it's Paul Terry and some other band.
3831263	3832886	Man, she totally butchers that song, too.
3834833	3837196	You want to talk about Politary not being able to sing?
3837476	3840080	What was that one song featuring Angel?
3840440	3841601	She cannot sing.
3841642	3843624	Was it Ultra High Heels or something like that?
3844145	3845106	Yeah, Ultra High Heels.
3845526	3847529	I'm sorry, but that chick cannot sing.
3847589	3849411	Politary has a voice, but that chick doesn't.
3849491	3850152	Okay, bye.
3850272	3851574	Megu cannot sing.
3853556	3855517	You know why you listen to me?
3855537	3858278	The only shitty thing about Stick Around is the lyrics.
3858338	3860238	The lyrics are so awful.
3860299	3861099	They're awful.
3861139	3862099	They're goddamn awful.
3862119	3862839	Make it bigger.
3863220	3864460	Video is terrible.
3864580	3865780	The singing is terrible.
3865821	3867141	The lyrics are terrible.
3867201	3868481	The song is terrible.
3868541	3869502	Gee, I don't know.
3869522	3870462	Okay, I have to defend it.
3870822	3872563	The music itself is alright.
3873263	3874083	The singing is alright.
3874264	3875724	I like Miracleman.
3876244	3877025	It's cute though.
3877085	3877925	It's all happy and...
3879606	3880247	Stupid!
3880367	3884128	And the video, it looks like, at the very beginning of the video, it looks like we're going to go on a safari.
3884148	3887089	God, why don't I just put on the Discovery Channel?
3887570	3888830	At least I'll hear better music.
3889750	3892211	Alright, speaking of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, I'm glad you brought this up.
3892392	3893512	I wanted to mention this real fast.
3893532	3901695	For the first time, it sounds like they're going to be doing what they're calling Power Up, which is basically 8th Mix, 7th Mix Plus.
3901715	3904576	They're doing a new version of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania called the Power Up.
3905197	3908378	And from what we're being told, there's going to be some new songs in it
3909847	3914015	Begin by Ryu Kisoka, which is one of the B4U chicks, if I'm not mistaken.
3915016	3916900	Ryu, oh sorry, I missed the I, my bad.
3918829	3919409	Power Up.
3920069	3920670	Oh, shit.
3920710	3921410	And they're returning.
3921670	3926391	They're putting in some more of the old songs that are coming back, like Fire in the Dark, and On Our Way.
3926411	3927352	How about Haru Spring?
3928332	3929192	Isn't Haru Spring in?
3930092	3931013	Those bastards.
3931033	3939015	I only played it once, and Jamie made me play Another World, and then I played some other... Oh, I played the one where you do the steel drums.
3939195	3939795	Oh, Kachaka.
3939815	3940275	Kachaka.
3940295	3940875	I liked that one.
3940895	3941336	That was cool.
3941356	3942836	My third favorite song.
3942876	3944577	I got a shitty grade, but I did good.
3944777	3945717	No, what's the...
3946517	3949179	Extra Stage is called, it's in Japanese, but it's really, really fun.
3949219	3950219	Is it the Orange Lounge song?
3950239	3955963	It's got the characters, but the two girls, you know, but I don't think it's Orange Lounge.
3956123	3957444	That is the coolest song ever.
3958364	3958605	So cool.
3958805	3960946	The Extra Stage on Drum Mania Guitars.
3962627	3964848	I'm sure some people in our chat room will fill us in on that.
3964868	3965749	It's really hyper and peppy.
3966730	3968851	We honky, we don't know how to read Japanese.
3969321	3970221	Yeah, let's take a break.
3970241	3970982	What do you guys want to play?
3971002	3972082	I have no ideas.
3972342	3973062	Any requests in here?
3973362	3974123	Play ABBA.
3974723	3975423	No, no ABBA.
3976163	3976283	Oh!
3976883	3977123	No?
3977604	3978324	We will do ABBA.
3978944	3979404	I was kidding.
3979444	3980625	I was only kidding.
3980885	3982965	No, we're going to do... You got me started.
3983005	3984326	We did Hyper Boundary Gate before the show.
3984366	3984946	You were in the other room.
3984986	3985986	Or we could do Michael Bolton.
3986146	3986546	Or, no.
3987507	3987967	Michael Bolton?
3989267	3992248	I'm going to do... When a man becomes a woman.
3993348	3994009	We'll do some ABBA.
3994029	3996549	We're going to do erotic covering ABBA, though.
3996849	3997590	That's what we're going to play.
3999259	4005682	So, in the meantime, we're going to start this set off with... I don't know.
4005803	4006483	Oh, I like this one.
4006683	4008004	This is one of my favorite songs from 2DX.
4008024	4008604	We'll start off with this.
4008944	4010005	You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.
4010025	4015388	We'll be right back, and then we're going to talk about DDR Extreme and the FUs of the week.
4015468	4021791	Also, if you want to send me your FUs of the week over private message, you can do that now in the chat room, and we'll get to that coming back.
4028198	4029180	Thanks for watching!
4148708	4149951	Thanks for watching!
4196397	4200585	It's my only fight Now I didn't dream Now everything is new
4224126	4225332	Thanks for watching!
4266799	4276684	Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love
4350421	4353043	Thank you for watching!
4406043	4411161	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song Orange Lounge Radio
4412233	4424143	I had to play that again, because everybody in here, Dave was laughing so hard the first time, the others couldn't hear it, so, I know we've got more people joining us since we started the show, but it's very rare we get a new promo around here, so, had to play that for you guys.
4425325	4438276	I got a clarification during the break, by the way, you are listening to Orange Launch Radio, we were talking about Guitar Freaks 8th and Drum Mania 7th before the break, and thank you to Arcadian42 who's filling us in, saying that the extra stage is called Mikene Ko Rock.
4441514	4443136	No, not Mechanical, it's Japanese.
4443156	4443436	Mikaniko.
4443536	4444076	Mikaniko.
4444397	4444617	Rock.
4444977	4445217	Rock.
4445518	4448580	Sounds like Mechanical, but... Remember there's that cat, Parfait, the cat?
4448600	4449621	Oh, yeah, the cute little cat.
4451003	4453104	Aw, if Justin's listening, I'm sure he likes that.
4453205	4454746	We gotta have them back on the show, by the way.
4455086	4456608	Justin and Mike, they were here a few weeks ago.
4457478	4458878	Actually, a few months ago with this man.
4459018	4462739	Yeah, they need to return my freaking Beatmania 5-key controller.
4462759	4463960	Oh, oh, oh.
4464280	4465740	About time I got that thing back.
4465860	4468601	I think they're both listening, so if you want to put out a special shout-out.
4468621	4469081	Need controller.
4469101	4470041	Want the controller.
4470661	4472702	Can't play Beatmania without a controller.
4473222	4479803	And Arcadian thinks that the long version extra stage is something like Sumi, Nagra, Kanojo, but not sure.
4480544	4482744	The bonus stage extra stage is crap.
4483224	4483484	Oh, okay.
4483564	4483984	Well, thank you.
4484004	4486045	I mean, it's okay, but it's not worth playing.
4488644	4490505	I love that song, Power.
4491446	4492727	I don't know.
4494708	4495128	Power.
4495208	4496269	You just like Power, don't you?
4496309	4498850	Power, and I also like Candy Star.
4499831	4500811	I don't really like that one.
4500831	4502693	I was expecting to play the actual Candy.
4504233	4505214	It could be worse, though.
4505494	4506415	It could have had Crash.
4509827	4514208	Crash is the Ingress version of one of those songs.
4515388	4516688	Yeah, Breakdown, thank you.
4517268	4519169	Why the hell can't I... God, I can't think of it.
4519189	4521309	No, but see, it's bad because they have Under Control.
4521749	4523369	The worst song ever.
4525270	4525810	Okay, fine.
4526450	4531551	The middle isn't that bad, but the beginning is Crash and Burn, Crash and Burn the whole time.
4532191	4532811	It's annoying.
4533231	4534692	Sounds like GWAR or something.
4534872	4537172	Oh, DDR Mike says you'll get it back when they go to Shafton.
4539813	4540653	Yes, go do Shaft.
4540953	4541314	Everybody.
4541454	4542494	Everybody should go to Shaft.
4542514	4546215	Come get some Shaft on November 9th over at Scandia.
4546615	4550617	Yes, I'm working on those flyers, so we'll have those.
4550797	4552377	It'll be cool.
4555038	4556479	Okay, let's do the FUs of the week.
4557319	4560200	Jamie's not here, but if she were here...
4560856	4561197	DarkSakura.com
4575495	4576435	Brad, you have an FU of the week.
4576635	4577136	Hangovers.
4578016	4578776	Oh, why is that?
4579757	4580577	Well, they're not fun.
4581878	4585059	That's why you're supposed to drink bread and eat water when you're getting drunk.
4585079	4586119	Drink bread and eat water.
4587140	4588280	Is that what I just said?
4588300	4591301	I'm dyslexic, I'm sorry.
4591561	4592382	Dyslexic?
4593622	4594823	Nah, that's not that big of a deal.
4596543	4597184	How about you, Rob?
4597204	4598184	Do you have an FU of the week?
4598204	4599185	Do I have an FU of the week?
4599225	4599905	I'm not sure yet.
4599925	4600505	Go to the others.
4600685	4600965	Loki?
4601045	4601846	Okay, how about Dave?
4601986	4603266	Dave, do you have an FU of the week?
4604147	4604447	I do.
4605007	4605307	Kind of.
4606087	4609650	F you to all my teachers at school for giving me way too much homework.
4610130	4623821	I missed, like, one day of school, I think, like, two weeks ago, and somehow it was the one day where all the teachers assigned about ten assignments for the next two weeks of school, and so I missed that day, and now I've got a million assignments.
4623841	4625543	Fuck you, teachers!
4625603	4626424	I know you're listening!
4627344	4628045	Go away!
4629686	4630227	That's it.
4631287	4633009	You get detention for a whole year!
4633709	4634250	Some advice.
4634750	4635451	Don't miss school.
4636147	4636928	Stay in school, kids!
4638229	4639149	Be cool, stay in school!
4639570	4640871	Oh, so what if you're sick?
4640891	4641691	Step into a Slim Jim!
4642452	4643232	Oh, yeah!
4645394	4649037	Okay, anyways, uh, my FQ of the week has... Wait, hold on.
4649337	4653660	No, I was going to stay in school, then I threw up over someone else's backpack.
4653960	4654861	Eww!
4654921	4656142	Like, okay, go to the office.
4656202	4656442	Eww!
4657022	4657663	Grody!
4657703	4658544	They didn't give me a chance.
4658784	4660765	Not much is funnier than vomit, seriously.
4660785	4661586	Come on, guys.
4663018	4664279	So yeah, my F.U.
4664299	4668501	of the week, once again, goes to Golfland Sunsplash.
4669742	4670422	Again!
4670482	4671703	Big fat surprise.
4672043	4672443	Oh yeah.
4672664	4676306	Let's see, let's start with the fact that initial D's broken already.
4676406	4676626	What?!
4677526	4678427	What?!
4679107	4679908	One of them is broken.
4679948	4681569	No, that's unacceptable.
4682009	4682549	Unacceptable.
4682729	4683330	Unacceptable.
4684230	4688813	Because of that one being broken, I had to wait for over half an hour to play one game of it today.
4690147	4692328	It's like the new DDR or something.
4693089	4693689	Unacceptable.
4694549	4702953	Anyways, that and also because the fact that they're advertising that MechWarrior 4 is in the Sumo, but for some reason it's not there anymore.
4703194	4704574	You can't play MechWarrior 4.
4705215	4708656	So those bastards that put in money... Wait a minute, I played MechWarrior 4 on that thing.
4709377	4709617	Now.
4710097	4711337	So somebody downgraded it?
4711658	4712078	I guess.
4712898	4714419	Major props to those guys.
4714439	4715760	Major props.
4715920	4718141	That takes talent to be that stupid.
4719042	4720323	Fucking Speed Demon game!
4721283	4722124	I hate that game!
4723364	4724365	I own that game.
4724685	4726726	I still own that game for almost free.
4727307	4729128	It's not for free because I have to pay for it.
4729928	4733190	But... You could always steal little kids' tokens.
4733870	4736332	Or... Rent it for a small fee.
4737913	4741055	Why do that when I can just play like a dollar and win a thousand tickets?
4741095	4742776	What are you going to do with the tickets?
4742976	4744396	You win like a thousand tickets and then what?
4744436	4746237	You get to take something that's worth a dollar?
4746358	4747498	You get stuck!
4747918	4748279	I bought...
4749724	4760767	I spent probably about $5 or $4 playing that game, which is a lot of money, and I got a Glitter CD rack, which holds... Ooh, Glitter!
4760908	4762168	Like Mariah Carey Glitter?
4764028	4769630	It looks kind of like the inside of one of those lava lamp type things with all the tons of balls in them like that.
4770110	4772991	And it lights up.
4773831	4774532	No, I don't.
4775472	4775892	And, um...
4777196	4782777	It holds many CDs, and I... I have balls, I just don't like balls.
4785358	4785698	Okay.
4786818	4787118	Yeah.
4787839	4789059	Irene, do you have any FUs of the week?
4789959	4790819	Yeah, let's change topics.
4791139	4791879	Do you like balls?
4793060	4805323	So, um, I'm kind of sort of pissed off at my car because it kind of broke down, but I'm even more pissed off at book and automotive stores for not carrying the repair manual for my car, so fuck you.
4805503	4806083	Okay, thanks.
4807216	4808117	You have another FU, Brad?
4808337	4811959	Yeah, you already did.
4812239	4817242	Yeah, drink that bread, guys.
4817482	4817942	Good for ya.
4817963	4818663	Shut up.
4820144	4821044	I have an FU of the week.
4821745	4822465	It's about time.
4823026	4825027	My FU of the week is to Brad for being such an asshole.
4825087	4826948	Oh, you're special and you get Baclois.
4827468	4828229	Yes, I am special.
4830973	4832474	Yeah, my mommy told me so.
4833275	4836398	My FU of the week would go to the entire week itself.
4836978	4840741	I'm not going to talk about it on the show, but for those that know me, it was a really shitty week.
4840821	4842062	So let's just leave it at that.
4842142	4843143	So that's my FU of the week.
4843183	4844004	It's to the whole week.
4844384	4845345	The whole damn thing.
4846406	4846826	Fuck it.
4848488	4849609	Let's get to the chat room.
4853432	4855153	I hate myself and I want to die.
4855313	4856534	I slashed my wrist the other day.
4856575	4856995	No, I'm just kidding.
4857035	4857735	I didn't do that, but...
4861992	4864034	Yeah, yeah, you would probably be here.
4866336	4866936	Okay.
4867917	4870900	Let's talk about the chatroom FUs, those that have been sent to me, shall we?
4871400	4871740	How are you?
4872421	4873042	You want to read one?
4873262	4874062	Okay, let's see.
4874283	4876124	Oh, read SoCalKicks' then.
4876504	4876945	Read that one.
4877837	4884183	SoCalKick says, FooSky, actually he means F-U, F-U Sky for saving that sound clip.
4884544	4885845	You know that Me So Hungry one?
4888948	4898958	Fuck you everyone who can't understand what I said, it's Hungy, not Hunky, and fuck you PSATs because I got worried for nothing, they were the easiest shit ever.
4902987	4906228	I read that it said hongi, I just thought it sounded funnier as hongi.
4906308	4908389	I'm sorry, SoCalCake.
4908489	4910150	Twin sent me some FUs earlier.
4910190	4913551	People stomping on the PPP machine, which makes no sense at all.
4914331	4917692	You know what, I saw some girl playing it completely with her feet.
4917812	4919173	I guess she didn't understand.
4920093	4922135	that they're, you know... It's a hand game.
4922275	4923235	It's infrared sex.
4923396	4924937	It's like Russian Dance Revolution.
4924957	4927058	You use your feet to hit all the heroes.
4928499	4931641	And then there's like a gun there for you to shoot yourself, you know, Russian Roulette.
4931882	4936285	Did you ever think, by the way, if they did release an American version of PPP, the catch-up song would be on it?
4936385	4937085	I bet you anything.
4943670	4947873	An F you to the chat room for somehow going into invite only on Friday night.
4947893	4948793	Yeah, that was my fault.
4948834	4949194	Fuck you.
4950720	4952143	I'm only human, you ass!
4954066	4956811	F you to JB's dad for wanting to go online so he had to leave.
4956892	4958014	But he's back now, so never mind.
4961004	4962685	Black Lab sent me one before he had to go.
4962765	4964425	He was here earlier, but he had to go.
4965045	4969267	He says, fuck his parents' shitty computer for being slow and the only computer in the house.
4969767	4973168	Fuck his little brother for being such a little dickhead this weekend that he's had to watch him.
4973748	4978289	And fuck Star Fox Adventures on GameCube for being too goddamn easy since I beat it in 13 hours flat.
4978329	4980450	Well, I only played it for five minutes, and I knew it sucked.
4980950	4981430	Yeah, I know.
4981450	4983091	I didn't even have to play it, and I can tell it sucks.
4983151	4983491	Hello?
4984431	4987913	Uh, 23rd Magus says, fuck you to the cold virus for keeping me home all weekend.
4987933	4990534	I would have been at RVGL Saturday for Arcade Mania for once.
4990594	4991134	Fuck the cold.
4991494	4992075	That's okay.
4992135	4992995	You didn't miss anything.
4993135	4994496	All the machines are broken.
4995216	5000959	JB says, uh, his FU is to RVGL.
5002259	5004580	Uh, little kids like to grab asses at RVGL.
5004600	5005000	He's learned.
5005060	5006721	Well, isn't that something?
5007782	5008522	And, uh, he told me this.
5008602	5012784	It was literal as in, I think, like, really literal.
5013184	5013344	Like,
5013857	5018379	Very little kid, like a girl or something, I don't know, like four or eight or something.
5018599	5020040	At least it was a chick grabbing his ass.
5020660	5024822	Yeah, if there was a five-year-old kid grabbing his ass, that would be kind of creepy.
5025442	5026683	It's Anna Nicole Smith Jr.
5028864	5032105	Either way, it's illegal, so come on.
5032165	5034946	JB would also like to state that Jenny Rom will be his future wife.
5035306	5036667	Sure, sure.
5036907	5038348	I'm sorry, I was Japanese for a minute there.
5038428	5038668	Wife!
5041025	5041926	Watch the movie Simone.
5045848	5049030	DDR Mike says that... Oh, this isn't an FU.
5049090	5050531	He's telling me when he's going to come visit.
5050611	5051572	Never mind, that's not an FU.
5052452	5055114	DCB says FU to himself for coming in late.
5055755	5056635	That's one tardy.
5059177	5060418	Detention for a whole week.
5061578	5062099	For DCB.
5063752	5065033	I don't know, some guy in the chat room.
5067594	5068994	These people, they're all my best friends.
5069054	5070395	I keep tabs on them all the time.
5070415	5071795	No, I don't know, they just come in on Sunday night.
5072796	5074096	I read their FUs and they're happy.
5074116	5075177	That's how this show works.
5077017	5082599	Jazz says, FU to negative, immature people who seemingly can only solve problems with violence.
5084580	5086181	But violence is the only way.
5087841	5088322	You're right.
5089462	5090082	Loki...
5095643	5095823	What?
5096203	5097263	Why do they use violence?
5097324	5098424	Why don't they use cellos?
5098824	5099864	That's violence, dear.
5099884	5102825	Like guns.
5105866	5106466	Jazz is cool.
5107366	5111647	Slinky says, F you to Roseville Golf Land because it's a shithole and everything is broken.
5112028	5114228	The game room and Scandi are 600 times better.
5114808	5116989	Once again, getting into local DDR politics on this...
5117879	5120020	International Program, but that's okay.
5120320	5122640	Everybody should know what a shithole Roseville Golf Land is.
5122660	5125681	Exactly, maybe one of the assholes from Golf Land will be listening.
5125841	5126522	You know what I heard?
5126702	5131003	You remember that one time that I went over there and took pictures of all the broken shit?
5131123	5133944	Some of the employees got online and saw that, and they were pissed.
5134164	5135204	Pissed about what?
5135324	5136065	Pissed about what?
5136085	5137205	That I'm telling the truth?
5138635	5139175	God!
5139975	5140355	Fuck you!
5140395	5141296	Yeah, I'm going to do it again!
5141716	5142216	Just for that!
5142516	5150918	And then I'm going to take pictures of you when you're picking your nose and taking breaks when you shouldn't be and telling off little kids and pissing in the cokes and whatever you do over there.
5151078	5151438	F you!
5151638	5152078	I hate you!
5152138	5152559	Die!
5153479	5161641	No, but see, like, they just really actually did the first pecking that they've done in a couple of months and they fixed Guitar Freaks and Keep Working.
5161661	5164682	So if you went there now, a lot of stuff wouldn't be broken.
5164722	5165382	They turned up...
5166642	5170745	Yeah, if you went there now, I'm sorry, you'd probably see everything broken again.
5171265	5172986	Well, I went there earlier today.
5173086	5175408	The Guitar Freaks was turned up really loud, nice and loud.
5175768	5177729	Drum Mania is turned down almost to silent.
5178129	5182772	Let me add that I played Guitar Freaks for the first time in a long time a couple days ago.
5183567	5185167	and my ears were ringing afterwards.
5185307	5186028	It was so loud.
5186988	5187848	They're dumb.
5188288	5194010	I guess they don't realize that these games are based on music and you need to kind of make it sound good or else it's not worth playing.
5194990	5196290	I want to play Godard Freaks in silence.
5196350	5199511	I'm told that Roseville isn't the only golf land that's having problems apparently.
5199751	5202212	SHGL got their 2DX screen fixed.
5202352	5202672	I didn't even...
5203698	5204158	Excuse me.
5204999	5205640	I burped on the radio.
5206620	5209603	I didn't even know that SHGL got 2DX back, but apparently they did.
5209863	5211945	They got their screen fixed, and now it's broken again.
5212265	5216248	So, hey, it runs in the family, I guess.
5216569	5223014	We should just go to all the golf lands and quote, end quote, overplay the games and make all of them...
5223635	5240462	you know, wanting the arcade doctor and then they'll see how bad it's going to affect yeah I need to pay a visit to the arcade doctor is that all the girlfriends do that or is that just Roseville who cares I think they know what I am implying but they'll see how much it suffers you know, like you know
5241636	5245278	Yeah, they'll see how much people don't like it, and then they won't get any business, and they'll die.
5245479	5245859	Okay, bye.
5245939	5246579	Anyway, yeah.
5246619	5249521	But the thing is, you can't go play the games if they're all broken already.
5249581	5250942	We're not going to make any money.
5251322	5255345	Well, the ones that are still working, we should just overplay them.
5255745	5256286	Well, don't quote.
5256666	5257506	Anyway, I want to finish up.
5257526	5258187	There's some FUs.
5258507	5260028	DDR Mike did send an FU after.
5260308	5261509	Oh, yes, Irene, you have an FU.
5261949	5263730	It's not quote, unquote.
5264131	5265672	It's quote, end quote.
5265992	5267593	Why would you unquote something?
5268033	5269134	Somebody please tell me.
5269594	5270175	Shut up.
5270335	5271395	End quote.
5271415	5271836	You lose.
5271896	5272316	You lose.
5274737	5280861	DDR Mike says, F you to Mountain Mike's left side pad down arrow because it's stuck for three minutes straight on Saturday night.
5282062	5282843	Hey, wait, Rob.
5283243	5284164	Yeah, good for freeze arrows.
5284184	5284484	Thank you.
5284564	5285284	I have another F you.
5285464	5286865	F you to you.
5287326	5287706	You guys...
5288800	5289521	Everybody hates me.
5289541	5291082	You don't have any vanilla Cokes, though.
5291382	5291682	I don't.
5291742	5292523	Go buy one yourself.
5293003	5293204	No.
5293264	5294565	I'm sick of buying you people crap.
5295205	5295365	No.
5295566	5296586	I'm just ghetto poor this week.
5296626	5297307	I haven't been to the store.
5297367	5298728	I'm going to the store after the show.
5299289	5302591	Not that I'll do you any good until next week, but hey, just thought you'd enjoy doing that.
5302611	5303332	Thanks a lot.
5303992	5305714	Don't worry, I'll bring Krispy Kreme one day.
5306174	5306634	Some advice.
5306694	5307155	Get a job.
5307195	5311879	And then Slinky's follow-up is that Japanese people own us all, and that's not local.
5312960	5315161	Just remember I said his local mom.
5315442	5316923	And their simple kick-ass, I might add.
5319437	5320178	That's enough, Harspring.
5321659	5324321	Or as SoCalKick says, shine loose.
5326542	5328204	Let's move along here.
5328484	5329385	Oh, thank you, teacher.
5329665	5331106	Thank you for telling us how to run the show.
5331166	5331706	No, I'm just kidding.
5332007	5332287	You're right.
5332527	5333047	We need to hurry up.
5333288	5336090	We're not going to get to do listless if we don't talk about DDR Extreme.
5336110	5336670	Screw that.
5336710	5337531	Wait until next week.
5338872	5340173	Alright, let's talk about DDR Extreme.
5341075	5342136	What do you want to say?
5342176	5346678	Why don't you do a sim file update for us, Loki, and then lead on into DDR Extreme if you want.
5347218	5348019	Go for it, dude.
5348039	5349520	You're the one who wants to change topics.
5349600	5350300	It's all you.
5350941	5353142	Let's start off with Step Mania.
5354422	5354743	Let's see.
5354783	5358165	Beta 6, Release Candidate 3, better known as...
5359285	5361285	Step Mania Version 3 Final.
5361906	5364666	They're going to be going, hopefully it should be the final one.
5365006	5366406	A lot of fixes done there.
5366426	5371087	That's available now from Sourceforge.com or whatever their site is.
5371107	5372767	There's a link on DDR Maniacs.
5373027	5373748	Go check that out.
5373988	5374888	It's supposed to be pretty good.
5375128	5376128	I played it a little bit today.
5376208	5380189	It is a lot faster, so just go try that.
5380449	5383109	Other than that, DDR East Coast Invasion is back up.
5383129	5387610	They had some server problems earlier this week and everyone thought they were gone for good, but they're back, so...
5388070	5389010	Go check them out.
5389150	5391451	Any new contests by them coming up?
5391671	5397833	No, they're doing right now one of the things, it's kind of like to get the most popular character in all the DDR games.
5398193	5402054	They finished with the female characters and I believe, ah shit, I can't remember her name.
5402314	5402554	Alice?
5403394	5403754	Yeah.
5404114	5405115	Alice, I don't know, I just...
5406495	5407716	I'm just thinking, oh, Emmy.
5407996	5408296	Oh, yeah, Emmy.
5408377	5409337	No, no, no, not Emmy.
5409757	5410598	Alice, there's Alice.
5410618	5411038	Yeah, Alice, yeah.
5411078	5411318	Okay.
5411679	5414761	Yeah, she won, so they're starting with... Big surprise, see.
5414841	5417062	I could have told you that contest in two seconds, but that's all right.
5417082	5417443	Let's see.
5417943	5425528	Other than that, sim file-wise, supposedly there's a couple people working on making a Sakura DWI.
5426269	5427890	Other than that, not really much going on.
5428610	5430592	My site coming up, but that's about it.
5431614	5436259	I'm going to be adding tons more content on there, so be looking for some more of that stuff later this week.
5436820	5439082	I have to fix a few files before I can put them on.
5439403	5441765	Okay, a couple things to state.
5441825	5445450	First, on StepMania, the coolest thing is that you can speed up the speed of the song.
5445630	5446170	That's the coolest.
5446230	5448333	Not like how fast the arrows go, but the actual song.
5449133	5451775	Like, I think it's up to 1.5 times the actual speed now.
5452175	5452455	Yeah.
5452775	5453396	Yeah, that's cool.
5453496	5458579	But anyways, um... Oh my gods, I can beat Max Unlimited S4R with two times speed!
5458619	5459440	Oh my gods, Dizzy!
5460060	5460320	Whatever.
5460741	5461481	Yeah.
5461501	5467025	Um, so, other than that, I mean, other than stuff we mentioned, you know, Feet of Fury, Beta's out, you know, um...
5468047	5470388	No updates for DWI, but I really don't care.
5470448	5472908	I've abandoned all hope for them, unfortunately.
5473208	5481351	Maybe I missed this, but were there any new released characters online for the... No, they're doing... Okay, there's number six.
5481491	5486272	He has two more people that I don't really care about because I don't play DDR PC anymore because it sucks.
5487192	5492454	And, yeah, there will be another character released next Friday, so they're doing them every two weeks now.
5492794	5496135	I noticed it's on my payday Friday, so there are at least two characters to see.
5496175	5497595	Yeah, I mean, I really don't care.
5497655	5501696	There are all these freaky, weird characters, and no one plays that game, so it really doesn't matter.
5502516	5504377	Aside from that, like I said, my site.
5504577	5512858	I was thinking, you know, maybe once I get things going a little bit, since DDR East Coast Evasion does their own tourney mixes, I might actually run one.
5513398	5514459	And actually have prizes.
5514739	5517519	Because you know me, in my edit contest, I had tons of prizes.
5517659	5518580	Yes, oh yes.
5518720	5520580	And you'll be doing all those door prizes at Shaft.
5520840	5523464	Yes, I'll clean out my prize closet there.
5523505	5523905	Right on.
5523925	5525788	Oh, you're cleaning out your closet?
5526069	5527571	Oh, that, yeah.
5530055	5530976	Ha ha ha, anyway.
5531900	5533921	Okay, and now DDR Max Extreme.
5534061	5535843	Yes, Max Extreme!
5535883	5541386	They've been doing the testing started this Friday back there in Japan.
5541967	5543508	And people have been playing it.
5543588	5545529	And actually a bunch of new songs have come out.
5545929	5547510	A couple to mention.
5547550	5549632	There's going to be a new Revenge song.
5549772	5552794	It's all 16th and 32nd notes.
5553174	5554715	And it's 60 beats per minute.
5555276	5557317	It's 65 beats per minute, yeah.
5557717	5559458	Isn't it called DDR Extreme?
5559679	5559919	Yes.
5560079	5561060	Not Max Extreme?
5561100	5561540	Whatever.
5562461	5562841	Yeah.
5562921	5563722	Okay, bye.
5563922	5564402	My bad.
5564422	5565002	DDR Extreme.
5565042	5565563	DDR Extreme.
5565603	5566844	And that's called Bag.
5567604	5568025	I don't know.
5568105	5569326	What a name for it.
5570427	5572408	Anyways, um... Big Asian groove.
5573208	5574328	New Paranoia coming out.
5574408	5575548	It's Paranoia Survivor.
5575969	5579630	It's, um... It goes from 135 BPM to, like, 267... 270.
5580610	5585691	So, that should be pretty interesting.
5585771	5587532	Isn't there something that you have to do on that song?
5587552	5590153	Like, you double A it and you can get an extra stage or something?
5590293	5590493	No.
5591073	5591373	No, no...
5592142	5593142	Legend of Max
5613627	5618211	Now, supposedly if you double A Legend of Max, you get Sakura.
5618591	5623875	And I'd like to point out, I was correct, and I called it a long time ago that Sakura is going to be the bonus song.
5623935	5624656	You're the shit.
5625016	5626157	Yes, so I know that.
5626738	5634564	And we haven't really heard, I guess, if there's another extra stage, a different one, if there's Paranoia Survivor, if someone double A's that.
5636249	5638491	Every time I hear that, I think of that Destiny's Child song.
5638671	5641154	I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it.
5641654	5642756	No, no, no, it's like this.
5642816	5646699	You double, uh, parent a survivor, you get to vote somebody out of the arcade.
5646800	5650623	Or as 23rd Magus says, out-stomp, out-wink, out-dance.
5651224	5651885	What's out-wink?
5652846	5653646	I don't know.
5654087	5655348	What do you wink when you play DDR?
5656089	5656790	Out-twink.
5657250	5657791	Out-twink?
5657971	5659092	Yeah, twink, I don't know.
5662999	5665620	I've heard the word twink before, but it has absolutely nothing to do with DDR.
5665640	5667100	I guarantee you that.
5667160	5668461	I'm not going to elaborate.
5668501	5671562	Other than that, let's see if we can pull up the song list here.
5672222	5673642	Oh, yeah, yeah, I can pull you up the song list.
5673862	5683505	For those that don't know, one of the big people that gives us information on the Japanese location test is the guy known as Aaron in Japan.
5685565	5687406	His website's over at aaroninjapan.com.
5688692	5689472	WildSide IrresistibleMint
5713258	5714039	Whatever that means.
5714159	5714840	That's stupid.
5715780	5719703	Speed Over Beethoven, which is, you know, on Speed 9, I believe.
5720344	5721024	That's pretty good.
5721745	5725568	Then there's also We Are The Champions, a cover of that.
5726109	5729191	We are the champions, my friends.
5730252	5732073	And then We Will Rock You is also there.
5732614	5734475	So it's a Queenie mix.
5736217	5736697	Anyways.
5737258	5738499	Big Gay DDR Extreme.
5738639	5739720	Yeah.
5740200	5742222	Let's see, we've got... Twink Revolution.
5743343	5744864	Some of the older songs coming back.
5744904	5749686	We've got Damn Darium, Rhythm and Police, Synchronized Love, I Believe in Miracles, If You Were Here.
5749966	5755609	I know there's a larger song list out there that has a lot more of the older rituals.
5755629	5757891	From what I understand, every Max 2 track is back.
5757911	5762453	And from what somebody else was saying... Every Max 2 track and every Max 1 track is going to be back.
5762473	5763874	Except for Telephone Operator, right?
5763954	5766315	Telephone Operator and Follow Me are still gone, from what I heard, right?
5766715	5771137	But Ghost is back, and all the good ones are back, except Telephone Operator.
5771157	5771958	I love Telephone Operator.
5772518	5774982	Bye Bye Baby Balloons back, much to our enjoyment.
5777265	5783013	But from what I hear is that initially you don't see them on the list, that you have to sort your list a different way to see them.
5783314	5784015	That's what I'm hearing.
5785849	5786890	Why would you do that?
5787170	5788031	That doesn't make sense.
5788271	5790852	Well, no, I think that it's a huge list.
5790912	5792794	I mean, you didn't see them right away.
5793354	5799358	Also, they're going to have an unlock system similar to Max 2, except it's going to be fewer points in between, a ton more unlocks instead.
5800198	5803580	You're going to have also, like before we've mentioned, the non-stop mode.
5803620	5807463	They're going to actually have a Player's Best non-stop that you can play on there, which is kind of cool.
5807823	5809204	It'll be the top four songs.
5809324	5812766	Arcadian can get out the pen and pencil again and start writing down Player's Best every week.
5812806	5813446	That was pretty cool.
5813546	5815808	I remember when Forthmix was out and he was writing them down every week.
5815828	5818309	And it was like, Casey Kasem's Top 40 in the Player's Best.
5818930	5819490	Exactly.
5819890	5820851	Sorry I had to be here.
5821491	5822151	Inside joke, I guess.
5822171	5827855	Then, of course, you know, not to be any surprise at all, drop the bomb, the SystemFX mix.
5829162	5830503	Of course, they couldn't stay U.S.
5830523	5831685	exclusive for very long.
5831785	5835108	But there are still some... Oh, I'm sure you'll see the Dynamite Rave one on there, too.
5835188	5836429	I'm sure that's going to be in there.
5836589	5837550	So cold, so cold.
5837630	5840112	You know, So In Love, Kind Lady.
5840192	5841454	Didn't know those were going to be on there.
5842755	5843255	Kind Lady.
5843636	5844577	I love that song.
5844617	5846699	V, of course, they said V was an 8-footer.
5847879	5849200	Love, Love, Sugar, DJ Taka featuring Noria
5877799	5886126	Lamor et Libierte, Kiss Kiss Kiss, Feeling of Love, Moba Moga, Frozen Ray, Miracle Moon, L.A.D.
5886146	5887307	Lifestyle, Destiny Lovers,
5900410	5902051	Yes, it's the LED version.
5903092	5904713	And this is too cool.
5904773	5908195	From Mambo a Go-Go, Gamalande Couple is on there.
5908235	5908975	That rules.
5908995	5910756	I'm going to have to play that.
5910936	5913998	And not on this list right here, because this is an old list.
5914819	5916220	Jet World is on there.
5916520	5917120	Ah, very cool.
5917260	5918141	Jet World's on there.
5918161	5920222	What are you talking about?
5920242	5921143	The steps could be cool.
5921443	5923324	Let me scroll on down and see if I see some other stuff.
5923344	5923404	Why?
5924486	5925748	A, Colors, at least 100 seconds
5946710	5947530	Thank you for watching.
5947771	5948411	See you next time.
5970261	5971922	Let's see here.
5972182	5972562	230 songs.
5972842	5973402	Supposed to be in it.
5973702	5974122	My final.
5974663	5975923	But the test is only, what, 50% done?
5975943	5976823	Something like that?
5977123	5977724	Something like that.
5978684	5981085	They didn't know when it was going to be released.
5981285	5984846	I heard rumors of end of the year, early spring.
5984886	5988227	We've heard late December and early January.
5988527	5988787	Yeah.
5989988	5990428	I hope so.
5991328	5992468	Right in time for New Year's Eve.
5992728	5993229	Oh, shit, man.
5993249	5994009	Let's just put it this way.
5995421	5997825	That machine right there will definitely own.
5998026	5999809	I mean, there's no doubt about it.
6000249	6000610	230 songs.
6001071	6003616	The question is, how soon before it breaks in our local golf land?
6004497	6005419	Golf land, man.
6005659	6006541	It's going to be Scandia, man.
6008510	6018976	And there's also another report, Aaron in Japan mentions that Shine was AAA'd on Heavy within two hours by one of those insane Japanese dancers, Yosaku.
6019076	6026860	Of course we don't want to obviously reveal to any Konami people that someone got pictures from the test location, but someone did get pictures from the test location.
6027540	6030282	Someone that's a website we might be looking at right now.
6030842	6035525	And supposedly they should be leaked out a couple weeks from now.
6036144	6036804	Okay, cool.
6036864	6037985	There's a lot to look for that.
6038085	6040066	I don't really know if it's going to reveal anything.
6040126	6040546	Probably not.
6040606	6041126	Who cares?
6041166	6043647	Probably it's just going to be more kind of screenshots.
6043787	6044167	I like those.
6044407	6047128	When Max 2 was first out, they got a lot of up-close screenshots.
6047148	6047768	That was pretty cool.
6047788	6048989	I'm waiting for those kind of shots.
6049109	6051090	There are people that have access to them.
6051270	6056011	I don't have access to them because I'm not on that board, and I don't know Aaron, so obviously I can't get access to them.
6056352	6056932	He hasn't passed.
6056952	6061614	We're protected, so there's no way for us to get him, unfortunately.
6061634	6065415	Let's see what else is here, if there's any other exciting news to share.
6065915	6070796	No new upgrade for the cabinet as posted a long time ago on Team Boilo.
6071676	6072696	It's the same software.
6072716	6073796	It should be an easy upgrade.
6074216	6076997	They're saying that Speed Over Beethoven is the best new song.
6077037	6078977	A lot of people are saying that.
6079257	6080257	I'll have to see if I can get that.
6080277	6081998	I think I can get that from one of the... I've heard it.
6082138	6084318	It's... I can't remember.
6084358	6085318	I'm not good at classic music.
6085358	6086259	It's on Speed 9, isn't it?
6086959	6087479	It's on Speed 9.
6089359	6090279	It's on that one song.
6090359	6093280	It's like... I can't remember.
6093320	6093720	It's the one...
6103238	6109763	I'll see if I can get that for you guys and play it next week.
6110363	6111244	I know somebody who has Speed 9.
6111524	6112785	I'll get a copy of that.
6113105	6114586	Alright, we'll play that for you guys next week.
6114606	6115267	I don't have it right now.
6115327	6115747	Sorry, guys.
6116588	6118349	If somebody in the chat room has it, feel free to send it to me.
6118369	6119270	I'll play it before the end of the show.
6121203	6128527	That's pretty much all that's up with DDR Extreme, other than the very girly shot picture of Naoki.
6128587	6130708	They have pictures from test location.
6130808	6132009	Oh, Naoki's diary.
6132069	6133490	We haven't talked about Naoki's diary.
6134050	6134771	It was a filler.
6135111	6135931	It was a filler.
6135971	6137272	It was nothing new.
6137472	6143615	It was him bitching about more songs we don't really care about, and it was also talking about... Wow, wow, my life is so traumatic.
6143735	6150079	They were interviewing some people that were working on it and asking him stupid questions like, what's your favorite character in...
6150959	6152140	Like our listless.
6154982	6157103	Hey, stupid things can only be done on this show.
6158063	6166108	Listen up.
6166888	6170670	I think we're going to take another quick break and then we're going to wrap up this show.
6171671	6172311	How's that sound?
6175519	6176659	Sorry, you said wrapping.
6177300	6177720	Oh, thank you.
6177740	6178501	That was terrible, right?
6179001	6179561	Yes, it was.
6181002	6182343	What shall we play in this break?
6182403	6187826	Let's start off with... You want to hear Miracle Moon?
6189067	6190408	Okay, let's hear Miracle Moon.
6190568	6190928	Fair enough.
6191549	6193190	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6193210	6194711	We'll be right back to wrap up the show.
6395379	6399603	Okay, as promised, we were able to get a copy of that Speed Over Beethoven song.
6399623	6402004	Thank you very much to DDR Mike for sending that to me.
6402645	6403786	We're going to play it for you right now.
6403846	6405327	This is going to be a DDR Extreme.
6405347	6406588	It'll be an edited down version.
6406608	6408570	This is the full version, though, so you guys can get a sample of it.
6408850	6411152	This is Rose with Speed Over Beethoven.
6413013	6415696	Speed Over Beethoven
6464265	6474529	I need you one again, I can't leave with music on to save your life It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over It's over, it's over, it's over
6515117	6536294	Lalalala, lalalalala Into the night, you make me cry I need your love, to save my life I need you wanna get on and play with Listen to the song and our melody It sets you free You need your love, to save your life I need you wanna get on and play with You gotta save your life Into the night, you make me cry I need your love, to save my life
6559552	6560542	Music on a figure
6590325	6598867	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
6598907	6606028	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
6606048	6612650	We apologize for the awkward end there to that Speed Over Beethoven song, but that was right out of a non-stop, the Speed 9 album.
6612710	6615230	I didn't have time to edit that together, because that just got sent to me.
6615710	6617211	So, we hope you enjoyed that, though.
6617231	6618111	That was a pretty cool song.
6618131	6618811	What did you guys think of that?
6618931	6619091	It was...
6619831	6625216	I think I kind of like that a little more than Beethoven's Virus even, a little bit, just a little bit.
6647634	6650917	You could have fooled me that it was a Jimmy Ronson.
6652638	6654700	So what was that call that was more important than the show, Brad?
6656141	6656622	I'm just kidding.
6656642	6657002	I don't care.
6658263	6658603	I don't care.
6658623	6660084	I just thought I'd put you on the spot.
6660725	6662607	We're winding down the end of the show here.
6664508	6664928	Oh, I'm sorry.
6665289	6666029	Oh, yeah.
6666170	6668752	I see you want to have a conversation this year while I try to do the show in this year.
6668792	6669152	That's fine.
6669192	6669552	That's fine.
6669612	6669993	I can do that.
6671396	6674097	Uh, anything else you guys wanted to get out of your systems before the show was done?
6675197	6675357	Nope.
6676617	6677938	No, there's no other things you guys want to talk about?
6679318	6682979	Let's talk about... Sex.
6684339	6684659	Yes.
6685940	6688660	Irene said it, but it kind of didn't get picked up on the mic.
6688780	6690361	What would you like to talk about sex, Irene?
6691661	6692821	It's great.
6697822	6697962	Ah.
6698282	6698423	Ah.
6699943	6700023	Ah.
6703892	6705934	You can't relate sex to the money in any way?
6706974	6708075	Outside of erotic songs?
6709396	6710797	Well, I'm sure you can.
6710917	6717082	I think, like, they should, you know, how you were saying about the announcer, you know, relating it to, like, a guy jizzing or whatever.
6717142	6721205	And if you fail a song, you should say, oh, well, premature ejaculation happens.
6722526	6724767	I think that would be funny if the announcers had that.
6724987	6726008	Yeah, okay, there you go.
6726689	6727129	This is it.
6727169	6728230	This is the money shot.
6731625	6731825	69 Combo!
6731845	6732526	Oh yeah!
6758101	6762104	It would be like that Saturday Night Live sketch where they had herbal essences for men.
6762884	6771110	And they were like, they were doing the organs like, You know, because you know how, yeah, okay.
6773492	6775714	No, I don't know how.
6780737	6783279	Boy, this show went right down the toilet real fast, didn't it?
6784250	6804161	Uh, yeah, right, when we said, uh, this is Orange Lounge Radio, uh... Let's see, to the latest, greatest, uh... Yeah, anyways... He said... Rob, Rob said... Rob said that's what it should say when you get a 69 combo.
6811733	6814575	It puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.
6815996	6817457	Wait, you watched Silence of the Lambs today?
6818118	6818738	What'd you think?
6819379	6820479	They were scary and good.
6820640	6821560	Did you never see them before?
6821580	6826344	I saw them when I was like 10, but I don't remember what happened.
6827705	6828905	Oh.
6829846	6831807	I went and saw that Rules of Attraction.
6832388	6833028	Oh, how was that?
6833088	6835090	I hear there's some pretty scandalous stuff in that.
6836578	6837439	Uh, not really.
6837799	6839281	I mean, it's not too bad.
6839421	6841763	It's a pretty, it's a stylish film, I would say.
6842183	6846026	Like, a lot of stuff that's, like, backwards and weird shit going on there.
6846666	6846767	Oh.
6846847	6852991	Like, it starts in, you know, it's one of those movies that starts in the middle of the movie and then goes back and then comes to the middle again and then goes forward.
6854172	6857995	Okay, I saw, uh, The Transporter on, I think, Saturday.
6858035	6858796	That was pretty good.
6859697	6859797	And...
6860580	6860820	What?
6860900	6864864	Yeah, I won't spoil it, but it's like the guy there is like the master pimp of everything.
6864964	6867766	I heard that that movie was a piece of shit, but that was just what I heard.
6868387	6869147	Who did you hear it from?
6869368	6871509	I heard the radio show was a piece of... No, I'm kidding.
6871930	6872750	I saw Spirited Away.
6872770	6877334	I was just going to say, you guys went and saw Spirited Away, and that's of interest to a lot of DDR people.
6877354	6877855	Hold on!
6878195	6880157	You said... Hold on what?
6880177	6884941	You like Showgirls, Rob, so... But I like Showgirls for its comic value.
6885261	6887603	There is much comic value to be having Showgirls.
6887883	6888344	That's right.
6888945	6891406	It was really funny on TV where they tried to censor all the boobies.
6891426	6894708	Oh, the VH... Yes, you have to see Showgirls on VH1.
6894768	6900412	Don't see Showgirls for the first time on VH1, but watch it for the second time on VH1 where they have to... Follow your Showgirls DVD?
6900612	6901552	You sure can, honey.
6901813	6902873	You ruin the effect of the insult.
6902893	6903574	Yes, you can, darling.
6907173	6908393	Oh, yes, tell us about Spirited Away.
6908693	6911154	Now, was the dub as crappy as the sub?
6911174	6911854	That's what I want to know.
6912014	6914255	I mean, was it crappier than the sub?
6914275	6914595	I'm sorry.
6914815	6915715	Spirited Away was a great movie.
6915735	6917095	I just want to know if they fucked up the dub.
6917416	6927178	No, no, the dub... Okay, I personally, I used to... When Princess Mononoke came out here, you know, in America, and I went and saw it in the theaters...
6928263	6932385	I was saying, and a lot of people were saying, that it was the greatest dub so far.
6932485	6933545	There was nothing as good.
6933745	6934966	This, in my opinion, is better.
6935226	6937006	There's no annoying Claire Danes.
6937807	6940248	But, I mean, seriously, the dub is great.
6940448	6941488	Everybody does a great job.
6941568	6943189	There's no overacting in it at all.
6945170	6946670	And they didn't change anything.
6946690	6947831	That didn't need to be changed.
6947891	6950112	The names are pretty much all the same.
6950632	6956154	There were a couple jokes thrown in that weren't in the original, but they were funny, and they made, you know...
6957099	6958599	They didn't ruin anything.
6958619	6959700	It was good.
6959920	6961500	Everybody should really go see that movie.
6961580	6962600	It was excellent.
6962640	6963641	I saw the sub-version.
6963661	6964401	It was excellent.
6964841	6965141	Excellent.
6965461	6965801	Yeah.
6966361	6967102	One of the best films I've seen.
6967122	6969742	And Disney did not make it, for all you people who don't know.
6970622	6976724	I know a lot of people listening will know, but I have this feeling a lot of the parents in the theater were like, Disney, it's a Disney movie, yeah.
6977164	6979845	And then Studio Ghibli and all that stuff.
6979945	6981445	I'm talking to myself now.
6981525	6981905	That's okay.
6982045	6983726	It was Miyazaki who made the movie.
6983846	6984746	That's what he was trying to say.
6986110	6989733	I also saw part of Initial D, the anime series, after playing the game.
6990173	6991534	Dude, that anime rocks.
6993235	6994255	Hello, and welcome to Last Week.
6994455	6995396	I'm just kidding.
6995496	6996437	I'd like to mention something.
6996457	6998178	It's video game related.
6998798	7004321	I just heard that they're making a sequel to Final Fantasy X, which is pretty interesting.
7004601	7007143	Okay, now, from what I hear... From what I hear...
7008599	7016122	In the US, those two sequels that they're making to Final Fantasy X, there's a Yuna story and there's a Riku.
7016462	7017923	There's a Yuna story and a Riku story.
7018303	7021304	And in Japan, those are going to be released as separate games, FF10, 1 and 2.
7021724	7023865	And please keep in mind, my word is not gospel.
7023885	7025606	I'm just spreading dirty rumors I've heard.
7025726	7027367	So if I'm wrong, then whatever.
7027407	7028007	I've seen screenshots.
7028247	7029088	Well, no, no.
7029128	7030308	I know they exist, but this is the thing.
7030508	7030928	This is the thing.
7031188	7037111	You know how Final Fantasy XI, it's online in Japan, and it's kind of been a bit of a wreck because they've had a lot of problems with the servers.
7039203	7044207	They won't release the hard drives here in America, so there's really no way they're going to be able to release Final Fantasy XI in America.
7044668	7048771	And playing online games in America is kind of... I don't know.
7048811	7054175	I don't know any online game I've ever seen that people take it seriously, except EverQuest, which is where people take it way too seriously.
7054636	7057898	So I think Final Fantasy Online in America would kind of be stupid anyway.
7058319	7059019	Ultima Online.
7059219	7066205	But what's going to happen, since they can't do it on the PlayStation 2 because they have no hard drive, they're going to release it on the computer as Final Fantasy Online.
7066665	7070026	Final Fantasy XI here in America is going to be those side stories.
7070046	7071787	They're going to release them as one game here in America.
7072047	7072927	That's just what I've heard.
7073167	7078249	But what's really strange about it is Yuna looks like freaking Lara Croft.
7078529	7083751	She's got two pistols and I don't know, it's just weird.
7085009	7086730	She's carrying forbidden machina?
7086830	7087350	What's wrong?
7087410	7088731	She's violating the teachings.
7089952	7093093	I think she said screw the teachings in Final Fantasy X in the first place.
7093373	7097015	And that and supposedly machina has taken over... Spoiler free show, please.
7097055	7097756	Spoiler free show.
7097836	7099477	I haven't really played through X. Come on.
7100017	7100317	Alright.
7101438	7102858	Well, yeah, exactly.
7102898	7103159	Thank you.
7103339	7109142	Well, this machina taking over Spira is after X anyway, so it has nothing to do with X.
7112142	7114884	Spoiler free show plays that includes you people in the chat room.
7114904	7117126	God damn, so not everybody's finished the game yet.
7117407	7119889	Some of us are just now getting our US PS2.
7119929	7124152	Some of us wasted all their money buying a Japanese PS2 and can't afford to get an American one.
7124172	7128016	Yeah, and those people play 2DX, so they suck.
7130918	7131619	You don't know me.
7131739	7132339	Sit down.
7133260	7133861	Talk to the hand.
7134901	7135382	I'm sitting.
7137564	7137804	Yeah.
7137824	7137904	Yeah.
7140710	7147135	Um, other than that, there's also, supposedly they're selling now a, um, international PS2.
7147816	7149857	Plays both US and Japanese games.
7150638	7150978	What?
7151118	7151839	I don't believe that.
7152019	7153280	I don't know, it's on YesAsia.
7153480	7157063	Oh, no, that, you know what, it's tricky, I saw that, it's just the way they worded it.
7157103	7163147	We go back and read it very carefully, it's not, it's not an all-region DVD, they just try to make it sound like that, so.
7163968	7164308	Alright.
7164588	7164868	Alright.
7165629	7167731	If I'm wrong, then, fuck em'.
7168669	7169890	All right, we're running a little over.
7169910	7171450	I want to finish up the last show.
7171510	7171930	Final thoughts.
7171970	7173271	Any final thoughts from you, Loki?
7173851	7175312	Check out my site if you haven't yet.
7175372	7181955	It's www.leachfromloki.tk All right, any final thoughts from Dave?
7183496	7186257	Go watch Initial D. It is cool.
7186917	7188418	Any final thoughts from Brad?
7188838	7189618	Oh, I'm sorry, you weren't done?
7190238	7190559	My bad.
7191459	7193540	My final thought is that I am done now.
7194440	7195181	Okay, thank you.
7195221	7195561	Pass it on.
7197958	7199321	Any final thoughts from you, Mr. Brad?
7199782	7203490	It puts the lotion on its skin and puts it in the basket.
7205094	7205635	Alright, thank you.
7205675	7206677	Any final thoughts from you, Irene?
7207639	7208200	Bye.
7208789	7209429	Bye, that's it?
7210410	7211030	Okay, fair enough.
7234601	7239426	Every track that I've got, which is everything, except for, I don't think I have all the eighths, but I've got just about everything.
7239987	7244372	So we're going to play 2DX music all night long until I feel like shutting it off, which will be a couple hours.
7244452	7247095	So enjoy that, you guys.
7247195	7247555	That's it.
7247575	7248656	That's all I've got to say for now.
7248776	7249858	So good night, everybody.
7250538	7251659	Thanks for listening to Orange Lounge.
7251699	7255323	On behalf of Jamie, who couldn't make it, and I, thanks for listening.
7255363	7255664	Good night.
7256889	7259330	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
