00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
It's a video tape! Put it in! Put it in!

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Boring!

00:25.000 --> 00:43.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain nudity, Orange Lounge may

00:43.000 --> 00:49.760
contain many four-letter words, hide Orange Lounge Radio from the fucking children!

00:49.760 --> 00:53.640
The last Metroid is in captivity.

00:53.640 --> 01:08.640
The galaxy is at peace.

01:08.640 --> 01:15.880
I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone, my kind of people, and assholes.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.880
Ron, Rono, he's good.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.880
Missed it by that much.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.880
That's Dr. Evil's cat.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
How can you tell?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.880
I never forget a pussy.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.880
37. My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.880
In a row?

01:31.880 --> 01:33.880
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

01:35.880 --> 01:40.880
So you get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.880
Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.

01:45.880 --> 01:53.880
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
Dark Sakura.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.880
I hate nature! I just wish the world would explode and then I could take over hell.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
Sky.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.880
Do I look like the weather girl?

02:00.880 --> 02:01.880
No.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
Everything alright?

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.880
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.560
We are live and this is episode number 15 for October the 6th of 2002.

02:12.560 --> 02:17.440
You're tuned into the Bemani Sings most super duper radio station of all things Bemani.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.000
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.020
Joining me as always is our resident happy bunny.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.360
Everyone please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Zakra.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.360
Hi.

02:26.360 --> 02:30.400
You sound so weak tonight, you sound weakened.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Hi!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.240
Dark Zakra needs food badly.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
I had cupcakes.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
That's my crack.

02:35.240 --> 02:40.240

02:40.240 --> 02:42.400
i don't know how to do

03:09.320 --> 03:10.940
which in the United States

03:10.940 --> 03:14.860

03:14.860 --> 03:17.440

03:17.440 --> 03:24.440
well earlier but my dad like hell no one

03:24.440 --> 03:29.440
Okay, that's not nice. Cool.

03:29.440 --> 03:37.440
Okay, so we'll be talking to everybody else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do some more of Jamie's picks.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.440
That whole last hour was just nothing but Jamie picks.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
This one was special.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.440
We're doing more Jamie picks. How is it special, Jamie?

03:42.440 --> 03:45.440
This particular one is one I talked about last week.

03:45.440 --> 03:52.440
It's basically Osamu Koboda and Tack live doing Presto and Era.

03:52.440 --> 03:58.440
And then the minute one after that is a song that's from Beatmania's final.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.440
It's the Naoki track.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.440
Sounds very good. We're going to hear those.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.440
And later on we're going to be talking lots and lots and lots about Max USA.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.440
Tons of news on that coming up.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.440
And we'll talk about 8 style. We'll see if we can get Naoki journals.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.440
Your FUs of the week and just a ton of shit tonight.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
So tell everybody to listen.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.440
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.440
Dear Diary.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.440
Dear Diary, Orange Lounge is cool.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.440
Dear diary,

Oh, Ash!

10:09.200 --> 10:13.200
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

10:13.200 --> 10:21.760
We have Jazz in the chat room tonight.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760

10:22.760 --> 10:23.760

10:24.760 --> 10:28.320
We are very glad to have you back in the chat room.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.120
Hello to everybody in our chat room.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.200
We've got lots of people in there tonight.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.900

10:46.700 --> 10:47.700
Yes.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.700
So, wow.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.700
Wow.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.700
Big, how was your week?

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
Let's transition our way into the show.

10:54.700 --> 11:00.020
That's going to go into my fuck you of the week, so you should hold on to that.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.540
I'm going to tease our, because we usually do fuck yous of the week, like first thing

11:02.540 --> 11:03.540
right away.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.720
it maybe the second half of the show, just because I feel like it. I don't feel like

11:07.720 --> 11:13.600
doing the fucking show. Yes, we're evil. We're going to make you wait. I have some thank

11:13.600 --> 11:18.240
yous of the week though. I've got plenty of happy news for this week. We don't need happy.

11:18.240 --> 11:23.400
We need pissy. I want to be happy. I've got lots of happy news too. Well, as we mentioned

11:23.400 --> 11:28.480
before we went to break, Loki knows how to kiss some host ass around the show, got Jamie

11:28.480 --> 11:33.280
and I some advanced copies of Notorious CHO on tape. How cool is that?

11:33.280 --> 11:36.840
We are happy and need to change pants.

11:36.840 --> 11:44.360
Yes, very happy. I am very happy. So, we got that and also a big thank you to Loki and

11:44.360 --> 11:48.800
Black Lab as well, who is one of our regular listeners also in the chat room. They've been

11:48.800 --> 11:53.120
whoring out the show in their signatures and we always appreciate every free promo we can

11:53.120 --> 11:54.720
get. So, a big thank you to them.

11:54.720 --> 11:55.720
Thank you.

11:55.720 --> 12:02.520
I'd like to give a big thank you to jahi if you're out there listening for cracking me the fuck up on under station live

12:02.520 --> 12:05.480
org last night, that's the radio show I do on Saturday nights and

12:06.400 --> 12:09.000
He was so damn funny on that show last night talking about

12:09.600 --> 12:11.600
Giving the bling bling to Ling Ling

12:12.160 --> 12:14.160
How it's gonna do a drive-by on the pandas

12:14.160 --> 12:15.920
I know it makes no sense to any of you out there

12:15.920 --> 12:22.000
But trust me if you listen under station live org it's fucking hilarious very good on the show last night and what else?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.940
Walgreens

12:23.940 --> 12:26.940
Last minute junk food, around about 15 minutes before I came here.

12:26.940 --> 12:27.940
And vanilla crack.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.940
And yes, vanilla coke.

12:29.940 --> 12:32.940
And there was something else I wanted to thank. I forget what it was, though.

12:32.940 --> 12:37.940
I would like to thank air for being there for me to breathe.

12:37.940 --> 12:42.940
Rob wanted to thank me for being beautiful and inspiration. I'm like a muse.

12:42.940 --> 12:49.940
Here he comes, Mr. Orange Lounge.

12:49.940 --> 12:50.940
He's not very orange today.

12:50.940 --> 12:56.740
today. By the way, that's the only time you're going to hear me sing on this show. Unless

12:56.740 --> 13:02.780
you do your Let Them Move Elmo mix. Oh, God. That's old school. That is old school. I haven't

13:02.780 --> 13:06.180
done the Let Them Move Elmo mix. The only reason I don't do the Let Them Move Elmo mix

13:06.180 --> 13:10.380
on this show is because I know Twynn would get ahold of it and make some nasty remix

13:10.380 --> 13:19.740
out of it. So, I'm just withholding the Elmo bit. So, back in the news about DDR, Bimani.

13:19.740 --> 13:22.440
How was your week? How was your week in the B E Monte world?

13:22.440 --> 13:24.980
I heard you had some accomplishments this week.

13:24.980 --> 13:31.560
Okay, well, I tried to stop counting how many nine-footers I was doing, but I'm still kind of excited about it because I did so many in a row.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.020
And I finally

13:33.020 --> 13:34.480
owned Twilight Zone.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.300
And then me being the big idiot that I am, decided to do so deep.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.780
And my legs gave out from under me. Yeah, pretty far though. I was watching you do that.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.980
Like, I don't know if you know, but Irene, myself, and Brad, we were all kind of huddled in the corner watching you do it.

13:45.980 --> 13:48.100
We were like, oh, oh, oh, oh.

13:48.100 --> 13:56.100
My legs actually, you know when you get so tired that your legs just get really stiff after playing DDR?

13:56.100 --> 14:00.100
That happened to me and I could not move. I actually had to grab the bar.

14:00.100 --> 14:05.100
And you know, the bar for me, I usually treat it like it's made out of feces or something.

14:05.100 --> 14:12.100
Oh, accomplishments. I passed two 7-stars on 3DX. Yay! Absolute in Buffalo. And they were cool.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.100
Buffalo! Buffalo!

14:14.100 --> 14:16.100
Yeah, that song was cool.

14:16.100 --> 14:20.100
I tried many more, but I failed them all.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.100
I'm not good enough yet.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.100
Not until I can pass all of them.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.100
Be for you, another!

14:26.100 --> 14:28.100
Try Y31.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.100
Y31 is easy, try it.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.100
But I can't pass it yet.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.100
I was very, very happy today.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.100
I passed a 7 star in 2DX and I wanted to pass it for a long, long time at sync.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.100
I did Summer Vacation a couple days ago too, which is a flashing 7.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.100
That made me happy.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.100
Apparently my controller is blessed.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.100
Your controller is the bomb diggity.

14:45.100 --> 14:49.100
My 2DX controller kicks everybody else's controller's ass.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.100
And you know, I'm still pissed off about my arcade controller.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.100
Why's that?

14:53.100 --> 14:57.100
Because Konami style hasn't emailed me back, so let me know it's being redelivered.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.100
Fuck Konami! Oh wait, we're not there yet.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.100
Wait, why does your controller kick ass?

15:01.100 --> 15:04.100
Because my controller has magical powers.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.100
I can only pass summer vacation on her controller.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
I can't do it on my own controller.

15:09.100 --> 15:13.100
I can only do it on hers, because hers goes clacky clacky clack, and mine just goes...

15:13.100 --> 15:21.100
My controller stuck for like a week, and then I bitched at it, and it unstuck and has been beautiful ever since.

15:21.100 --> 15:34.100
Oh, because I was playing on Scott, white freestyle or whatever, his 2DX controller, and he said that he like shaved it down or something and it worked perfectly. That's pretty cool.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.100
I'm not raping my controller yet.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.100
Yeah, I don't know, but it worked and it didn't stick at all.

15:39.100 --> 15:43.460
I'm scared to open up my controller and give it an operation because I don't know, if you

15:43.460 --> 15:46.980
ever played that game Operation, I was so horrible at it and I'm afraid I'd do the same

15:46.980 --> 15:51.180
thing to my 2DX controller that the big red light would go off and go, eh, you know.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.940
Let me fix your controller.

15:52.940 --> 15:53.940
I will use the power of my...

15:53.940 --> 15:55.180
Oh, you're going to fix my controller.

15:55.180 --> 15:58.460
I will use the power of my bitchiness on your controller.

15:58.460 --> 16:01.420
I will put the fear of me into your controller.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.580
Are you just going to lay it on the ground and just go, you are a bitch?

16:04.580 --> 16:07.580
I command thee to work!

16:07.580 --> 16:13.580
The power of Christ compels thee! The power of Christ compels thee!

16:13.580 --> 16:18.580
Demons be gone from this controller!

16:18.580 --> 16:21.580
I hope my roommate didn't decide to go bed too early.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.580
Good thing. If he's smart, he got out of the house. I don't know.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.580
I didn't see him.

16:28.580 --> 16:34.580
Oh, I'm getting a suggestion in the chat room that when I play Operation, I should take out the battery and I'll win every time.

16:34.580 --> 16:40.940
a winner you know you know what I do what I pick up the thing and jump it

16:40.940 --> 16:46.460
upside down I wonder if we can do that with patience you should be a doctor

16:46.460 --> 16:58.380
Jamie you make tons of money a big special hello to our buddy sharks girl

16:58.380 --> 17:00.380
Just for you, baby.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.380
Hello.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.380
This is a dear diary.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.380
I've got a doughnut with your name on it.

17:06.380 --> 17:10.380
It made me feel all tingly.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.380
I don't want to talk about Monty tonight. Let's just sit here and ramble.

17:13.380 --> 17:18.380
Dear diary, I decided that I was going to be a hockey fan.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.380
Yay!

17:20.380 --> 17:25.380
You know, I swear to God, Naoki and Michael Jackson have got close relatives.

17:25.380 --> 17:28.380
I mean, they're both hideously feminine.

17:29.380 --> 17:34.380
Do you remember the rumor that Naoki was supposed to be one of the hidden members of B4U?

17:36.380 --> 17:38.380
I'm still convinced that he's a woman.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.380
Excuse me.

17:40.380 --> 17:43.380
Thank you. That burp was brought to you by vanilla coke.

17:43.380 --> 17:47.380
It's got that chili flavorings to it that I had earlier today.

17:47.380 --> 17:49.380
And now it's all over the mic.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.380
Ewww, let's rob Mike!

17:51.380 --> 17:56.380
I want to thank Del Taco. Del Taco owns. That's all I want to say. Thank you.

17:56.380 --> 18:03.380
All you people who ate real food today, I've had a doughnut, string cheese, and cupcakes.

18:03.380 --> 18:12.380
Whee! Oh, and the all-important bottle of Propel. Yes.

18:12.380 --> 18:17.380
I'm on the supermodel diet right now, where I have a cigarette for breakfast and a two-shot

18:17.380 --> 18:19.280
tequila for dinner

18:19.280 --> 18:20.600
but when is it

18:20.600 --> 18:24.060
calories what we say that

18:24.060 --> 18:27.460
for the sake of uh... internet radio i think that we get back to anything

18:27.460 --> 18:31.200
relevant half back and i'll fuck the money stop playing the are that's our

18:31.200 --> 18:33.780
advice get your life back

18:33.780 --> 18:35.740
savior but that is the trouble

18:35.740 --> 18:37.740
don't turn out like us

18:37.740 --> 18:38.860
we're here

18:38.860 --> 18:40.980
so anyways uh...

18:40.980 --> 18:42.260
yesterday

18:42.260 --> 18:43.580
went to an awesome

18:43.580 --> 18:50.580
party for Pat. Hey, Pat's cool, ok. I missed going, I went to the go. His birthday. So

18:52.180 --> 18:59.180
we went and we played the DDR sim, of course, the giant DDR sim. It's all about Super Shuffle,

18:59.860 --> 19:05.080
ok. Now, if you've ever wondered what... What, pray tell, is Super Shuffle? Super Shuffle

19:05.080 --> 19:09.940
is what Shuffle should be, it's where every single step is random. And then what's fun

19:09.940 --> 19:16.060
One is, shuffle works in doubles, so playing super shuffle in doubles is like playing twister.

19:16.060 --> 19:22.300
No, and see how freeze arrows work is, freeze arrows are set when the next arrow comes up,

19:22.300 --> 19:27.980
but since, so normally in a song, they have the specific ending, but since, and then the

19:27.980 --> 19:32.060
next note comes up under it, but since there's no note coming up under it, the freeze arrow

19:32.060 --> 19:33.360
just keeps going.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.480
You might have to hold, in doubles, eight freeze arrows.

19:36.480 --> 19:42.360
What happened last night? Scott had to hold all eight arrows. He failed like that song,

19:42.360 --> 19:44.480
but it was funny.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.720
That's when you have an orgy on the dance pad.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.320
You know what, Loki? I'm not playing on your metal pads again until you get the Spider-Stomp

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
Sim.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.320
I'm gone!

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
Spider-Stomp!

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
Spider-Stomp!

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
Fuck the body, it's all about Spider-Stomp.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
What are you taking, Sue?

19:56.320 --> 20:01.160
Well, hi-ho on doubles is actually pretty much like Spider-Stomp. It's just all jumping.

20:01.160 --> 20:07.160
Could you imagine how fucking horrible Golf Land would be if, well, you know, even more

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
so...

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
Golf Land horrible?

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
No!

20:10.160 --> 20:14.160
Even more so, if fucking DDR spat out tickets.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.240
Dude, I would be walking out of there with scooters every day.

20:18.240 --> 20:25.320
I know, but think about just how horrible the lines would be.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.800
If DDR spat out tickets, it's over.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.800
I quit.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.800
You know how much pretty useless shit that we have?

20:33.800 --> 20:39.320
Like I'd have a million little blinking raver lights and like five skateboards and oh my

20:39.320 --> 20:43.240
gosh I spent so much money on that game even if I only got one ticket for every time I

20:43.240 --> 20:45.440
played I'd still have a ton of shit.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.800
It's about time they give me something back for the money I spent on that damn thing.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.760
You know, you get it.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.600
I'm sorry Dave, did somebody say Rayvar?

20:55.600 --> 21:01.040
is the marked

21:01.040 --> 21:07.040
at the rate

21:07.040 --> 21:14.140
yeah

21:14.140 --> 21:19.140
uh...

21:19.140 --> 21:22.140
Yeah, let's get this train back on the rails here.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.140
Should we talk about...

21:25.140 --> 21:28.140
This is what we get for having all that sugar before the show.

21:28.140 --> 21:30.140
Yeah, but I didn't see so...

21:30.140 --> 21:31.140
Should we talk about the...

21:31.140 --> 21:34.140
You ate Cheetos, those are a weak sauce.

21:34.140 --> 21:35.140
So what?

21:35.140 --> 21:37.140
They're orange-themed.

21:37.140 --> 21:42.140
From now on, whenever anyone starts talking about raves on this show, I'm gonna play Sandstorm.

21:42.140 --> 21:44.140
Coming to a Max USA near you.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.140
We think. We're pretty sure.

21:46.140 --> 21:47.140
We hope.

21:47.140 --> 21:51.140
Confirmed, dammit. So, none of that.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.140
Anyway, your little precious update.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.140
Yes, our update.

21:56.140 --> 22:01.140
Naoki's spout-off is a little crap today, but we didn't really care about what he had to say.

22:01.140 --> 22:05.140
All we cared about is new information about DDR Max 3.

22:05.140 --> 22:09.140
Which is that non-stop modes will be making a return.

22:09.140 --> 22:10.140
Whee!

22:10.140 --> 22:12.140
So, hooray for non-stops.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.140
I guess.

22:14.140 --> 22:16.140
So, I guess that'll be fun.

22:16.140 --> 22:22.140
Also gonna be actually not really news yet, but it's coming is next week

22:22.140 --> 22:24.860
They're announced what song won the vote for?

22:25.540 --> 22:30.020
That's actually going to be in max 3 one song one song is going to win the vote

22:30.220 --> 22:38.300
No, they're announcing one song next week, and they're going to continually they're going to continually announce songs each coming

22:38.300 --> 22:40.300
Week so next Wednesday

22:40.940 --> 22:43.300
Okay, I believe it's the night. They will have

22:43.300 --> 22:57.300
They will have the next song for DDR Max 3, which I've heard is going to be Let Them Move.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.280
Saying rave in the chat room doesn't count.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.140
It has to be in the studio, so quit it.

23:03.140 --> 23:09.740
Jamie, quit playing with the ferret.

23:09.740 --> 23:13.700
celebration in the chat room saying, yay, I won't fail Oni Choruses with 3.1 anymore

23:13.700 --> 23:18.980
because non-stops are back. Yay! What song do you think will be announced? What do you

23:18.980 --> 23:26.300
think the first non-original will be? V? I think it's going to be V. That's where my

23:26.300 --> 23:34.980
money is. I would hope, I'm praying, that it's Instant Love. Yes, Instant Love! Hey,

23:34.980 --> 23:40.260
I'll have you know, I voted for that, so if it is, I'd be so pleased.

23:40.260 --> 23:41.260
This would be me.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.260
Instant love, clear cookies.

23:42.260 --> 23:43.260
Instant love, clear cookies.

23:43.260 --> 23:44.260
Instant love, clear cookies.

23:44.260 --> 23:45.260
Instant love.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.140
I swear to God, I'm such a fucking retard, okay?

23:47.140 --> 23:48.980
I went to the site to vote for a song.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.620
I voted for flotation.

23:50.620 --> 23:51.620
Flotation.

23:51.620 --> 23:57.500
I'm such a dumbass and I can't read Japanese.

23:57.500 --> 24:03.860
So let's read what Naoki has to say, since we don't really care, but anyways.

24:03.860 --> 24:12.860
Okay, the beginning of a prologue. With DDR finished and re-released in a matter of weeks, we had to begin work on the second game, DDR 2nd Mix.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.860
Ooh.

24:14.860 --> 24:21.860
2nd Mix represents the beginning of Naoki. What about 1st Mix? Was that not Naoki?

24:21.860 --> 24:23.860
See, I've been saying this.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.860
Because I'm brilliant to you.

24:25.860 --> 24:26.860
Naoki in a dress.

24:26.860 --> 24:54.860
Because of Brilliant to You, a song which quickly gained support of DDR players during its production, in respect to a music producer who played a large part in its production, you credited the song in your own name, Naoki.

24:54.860 --> 25:08.860
The song expresses you perfectly. It's the kind of song that makes a very pleasant sensation, as if the bewitched melody of synths is flowing from the very center of your body.

25:08.860 --> 25:23.860
I have to interrupt for a second just to say, if you don't like Second Mix, if Second Mix does not own your soul, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you a hundred times over. Second Mix is ownage. Jamie and I say so, therefore it is true.

25:23.860 --> 25:26.860
And because we're on the radio, you have to believe everything you hear.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.860
Strictly business, like what?

25:28.860 --> 25:30.860
Nah, brilliant to you, orchestra groove.

25:30.860 --> 25:37.860
Uh, fuckin' tub-thumping. That's all I have to say. Best freestyle ever. Fuck you.

25:37.860 --> 25:41.860
Anyway, I'll never forget the pleasant sensation held by this song.

25:41.860 --> 25:47.860
And so I tried to continue reproducing it.

25:47.860 --> 25:51.860
Incidentally, next time I feel I achieved this was in Dynamite Rave.

25:51.860 --> 25:58.860
Dynamite rave. That's no surprise. That's no surprise. Uh oh. We did say rave. Uh oh.

25:59.860 --> 26:06.860
Oh yes, you said rave. Oh man, this is so sweet. Oh, I'm seeing so many colors, man.

26:09.860 --> 26:16.860
This DJ, oh I love the DJ. Oh, praise the DJ. Oh man. Dude, I just drank my first drink.

26:16.860 --> 26:23.860
Wait, what, what the hell just happened? We have a, we have a word of the day.

26:24.760 --> 26:30.140
We have a word of the day, and whenever the word is said, we play that song, coming to

26:30.140 --> 26:37.140
a USA mix near you, and have our own little... The magic word is rave.

26:37.140 --> 26:44.140
Oh my god. Leave now! Save yourself!

26:49.140 --> 26:51.140
Anyway, back to the Nucky Diaries.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.140
We've got tweroes going here.

26:53.140 --> 27:00.140
Let's see here. Since the second mix, music technology hasn't advanced, but your range of songs is much wider.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.140
Listening to

27:05.300 --> 27:07.300
Your stupid rage

27:12.020 --> 27:16.240
What the hell wait what happened

27:16.240 --> 27:18.240
Welcome to the raid.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
Welcome to the raid.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.240
Welcome to the raid.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.240
Okay, back to Noki.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.240
I quit.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.240
Anyways, from now on it's just going to be called Dynamite R3.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
Sounds good, okay.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
Alright, let's see here.

27:34.240 --> 27:39.240
Listening to the soundtrack now, how do you think that has evolved since these early roots?

27:39.240 --> 27:45.240
Looking back and reflecting on music's second mix, it brings to mind songs like Higher, Baby Give Me Your Love from fourth mix,

27:45.240 --> 27:48.360
from 4th Mix. In fact, these songs feel like 2nd Mix.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.880
I haven't really noticed any... Okay, whatever.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.000
Anyways, there's a strong connection between the music in these two games.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.360
Yeah, because it's the same game. It's the same guy making it.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.080
Anyways, time has shown that 2nd Mix was a huge success.

28:03.080 --> 28:09.320
The 2nd Mix soundtrack CD sold over 550,000 copies,

28:09.320 --> 28:13.160
all for Butterfly. Yes, all for Butterfly and that

28:13.160 --> 28:17.520
Dynamite R3 anyway so with the successive

28:17.520 --> 28:23.200
whatever with the success of second mix lifting my spirits everything seemed to

28:23.200 --> 28:24.320
pass very quickly

28:24.320 --> 28:28.880
and before I knew it I was working on solo base mix third mix and true kiss

28:28.880 --> 28:30.320
destinations all at once

28:30.320 --> 28:34.080
GDR was really starting to take off

28:34.080 --> 28:37.920
what did he write for true kiss destination wasn't that all their own stuff

28:37.920 --> 28:42.600
no true kiss destination had sexy planet and

28:42.600 --> 28:47.680
Celebrate Night. I got it backwards. I thought the other one, Dreams Come True, had the Naoki

28:47.680 --> 28:48.840
tracks in it.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.200
Ah, Dreams Come True sucks.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.000
But it was a good beat mania mix.

28:53.000 --> 29:03.000
Good point. Very good point made in the chat room. $550,000 sold. One billion pirated.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.840
Anyways, some more stuff about the non-stop. They've got, it's going to be four songs in

29:08.840 --> 29:15.840
a life gauge, just like normal non-stops, and it looks like the highest score you can get is 100 million points.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.840
How many pirated copies? The second mixer award, thank you.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.840
Hey, I have mine on Dreamcast.

29:20.840 --> 29:25.840
I'm sure that guy that holds the world record is going to get 101 million.

29:25.840 --> 29:33.840
Oh yeah, dude, our twin galaxy's world record holder is going to get like, you know, 300 points and he's going to be the fucking world record holder.

29:33.840 --> 29:43.840
And then there's, okay, and then on Naoki's little journal there's some other crap I don't know what it is about. It looks like how to play with freeze arrows or something.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
It's how to dance like Naoki.

29:45.840 --> 29:52.840
You okay? You're gonna find what? Oh, you're gonna find the translator? Do you want me to go to break or something?

29:52.840 --> 29:58.840
Yeah, but it looks like it has something to do with the use of freeze arrows, like how they're inputted into the game.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
I'll try to go back with the translation of this after our next lecture.

30:00.840 --> 30:06.840
It's pointless information. No one cares. We can see by what Afro is doing, he is playing with a blank screen.

30:06.840 --> 30:11.840
So obviously he's not too smart to begin with. So we don't really care what's going on there either.

30:11.840 --> 30:16.840
Then they have some stupid, like, oh, this is a logo for secret rendezvous that didn't make the game.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.840
Oh, cry. Don't care. Okay.

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
Sniff.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.040
I kinda like that logo. It looks like it's pavement.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.200
Like, this game is hitting the pavement.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.200
Pavement? Girls on couch.

30:30.200 --> 30:34.920
Pavement? Girls on couch.

30:34.920 --> 30:39.200
Girls on pavement. Now you're getting somewhere.

30:39.200 --> 30:43.600
Their house could have pavement on the floor, okay?

30:43.600 --> 30:47.480
They didn't show the floor, they just showed the couch with the girls.

30:47.480 --> 30:54.120
So there, it can be like, wait, it can be like Night at the Roxbury, they have the inside

30:54.120 --> 30:59.840
out night club, and then they have, I almost said it, but I didn't.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
What?

31:00.840 --> 31:01.840
What did you always say?

31:01.840 --> 31:03.320
No, no, no, wait, hold on, hold on.

31:03.320 --> 31:07.640
Because that logo that you see before you start the song, I think that's what this was

31:07.640 --> 31:08.640
supposed to be.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.820
And you know, like, before you start the song, all the logo is, it just says, you know, secret

31:11.820 --> 31:15.000
rendezvous written in the neon thing and then, you know, divas.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.960
so i thought i don't know in that aspect of the that was kind of cool at least

31:17.960 --> 31:21.560
has a little arrow drawn under something it's not that plane but

31:21.560 --> 31:24.520
but the lesbian video rules

31:24.520 --> 31:25.840
yeah

31:25.840 --> 31:29.320
was being

31:29.320 --> 31:33.060
anyway so just want to stay tuned for next uh... for wednesday actually for

31:33.060 --> 31:35.600
nike journal three were to be talking about

31:35.600 --> 31:37.800
what he has for breakfast and

31:37.800 --> 31:40.000
and underwear

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
Here's I. Today my best friend Paula came over to sleep with me in my pressure taper.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
I got the idea from my good friend Mickey.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Now obviously we slept together and not together, you know what I mean?

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
Because I don't swing that way.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Speaking of secret rendezvous, we're gonna kind of transition to another topic here.

32:04.000 --> 32:17.000
As you probably know, the original PlayStation Magazine demo of DDR Max USA hit shelves this week, and one of the songs in it is Secret Rendezvous.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
Now, one of our pals in the chatroom, JB, took a really interesting picture. I want to show you guys, and I- shit, I already lost the link.

32:24.000 --> 32:31.000
JB, post that link in the chatroom once you hear that, the picture, so I can show that, and then everybody in the chatroom can see it too.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.520
it's it's a really funny picture about the uh...

32:34.520 --> 32:37.620
the demo i want to show you as soon as jb postal link here

32:37.620 --> 32:42.280
hopefully he's not a minute lag like some of the people in return

32:42.280 --> 32:45.720
uh... yeah i was supposed to mount over a but a lot of stores got it early so

32:45.720 --> 32:49.400
most uh... major grocery stores not stuff out now thank you slinky slinky

32:49.400 --> 32:50.520
into it

32:50.520 --> 32:53.860
and that would be in a chair will show you guys

32:53.860 --> 32:54.720
look at this

32:54.720 --> 32:56.700
if you sort by letter

32:56.700 --> 32:57.740
you get l

32:57.740 --> 33:00.620
the past and speaker on the bill

33:00.620 --> 33:03.040
whether the producers tried to tell you

33:03.040 --> 33:04.300
let's

33:04.300 --> 33:06.140
speaker about the people

33:06.140 --> 33:08.060
uh...

33:08.060 --> 33:13.740
that's a cool

33:13.740 --> 33:17.600
now we have to say about the lesbian they had a secret love us

33:17.600 --> 33:21.700
and you know i discovered

33:21.700 --> 33:25.540
anyway

33:25.540 --> 33:33.540
That's not even- Glenn raises a very good point. What the fuck are we saying? That's not even in alphabetical order. That picture is obviously photoshopped by somebody, right?

33:33.540 --> 33:39.540
Yeah. Wouldn't it be? Cause L- Or they thought it was L. Oops, sorry. Or they thought it was funny, too. Yeah, that would have to be photoshopped.

33:39.540 --> 33:47.540
Let me take a look. Boy, we're easily fooled on this show. Yeah, it's gotta be photoshopped, cause E doesn't come before- or, E doesn't come after L.

33:47.540 --> 33:50.540
Oh, you mean, maybe not.

33:50.540 --> 33:53.540
It would also be funny if it was ESL.

33:53.540 --> 33:55.540
Yeah, ESL, you know.

33:55.540 --> 34:00.540
Because most of the people at Konami must be taking ESL.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.540
They teach it in high school. Maybe they're all still in high school.

34:05.540 --> 34:16.540
Anyways, yeah, so one of the things that they did with this Max demo is they hacked into it and found the song list. Hooray!

34:16.540 --> 34:18.540
So, we actually have the song list.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.520
I don't think that that's a law.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.520
It's debatable and this is a huge debate and we're not going to get it resolved on this show.

34:25.540 --> 34:32.520
There's people said yes, that's the list and there are people people saying no, that's not the list and yes, that's the list and no, that's not the list and yes, that's, you know, what, it just keeps going back and fourth but.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.520
But.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.520
What, what, theory? Okay, let's hear the theory. Let's hear an interesting theory.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.520
DSCS SoCalCIC says it is fake.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.520
Again, yes it's the list, no it's not the list, yes it's the list.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.020
And DJ Konami says, no it's not.

34:49.020 --> 34:54.020
Why don't we just put in the demo and try it ourselves?

34:54.020 --> 34:55.020
That's what I'm saying.

34:55.020 --> 34:58.020
Okay, supposedly here's how they got the list, okay.

34:58.020 --> 35:04.020
They went in to the XA file, which is the PlayStation audio format, you know, that they use.

35:04.020 --> 35:11.020
Now, in those, you can actually listen to the small little samples of sounds that play when you select a certain song.

35:11.020 --> 35:16.020
Now, supposedly since they hurried to get this demo done so fast, they didn't bother to cut that out.

35:16.020 --> 35:18.020
Most average people are going to go,

35:18.020 --> 35:21.020
oh, I'm going to go hack into this and go listen for songs.

35:21.020 --> 35:24.020
So what happened was if someone did that,

35:24.020 --> 35:29.020
which just proves that people that play DDR are sick fucking people.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.020
Yes, so what happened?

35:30.020 --> 35:31.020
For any demo they're going to do that,

35:31.020 --> 35:34.020
they're just going to lock out the other stuff or remove it.

35:34.020 --> 35:38.020
So what they did was they went in there and actually listened to all that.

35:38.020 --> 35:40.020
Now, I'm not sure if there was an actual song list.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.020
I don't believe that there was an actual song list there,

35:42.020 --> 35:45.020
but perhaps they identified stuff based off of what they heard on there.

35:45.020 --> 36:08.020
I opened up a file in a notepad and it shows you a big list and it looked like every single freaking song that's ever been in DDR. Like it was for either some kind of append or it was all the four letter edit codes. That's what I thought it was. It was all the four letter edit codes because it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that that I know are not going to be in Max.

36:08.020 --> 36:11.260
codes, which that's what I thought it was, was all the four letter edit codes, because

36:11.260 --> 36:14.820
it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that, that I know are not going to be in max,

36:14.820 --> 36:19.020
that things are not going to be in max Tuesday, but it also had new stuff. It had the short

36:19.020 --> 36:25.060
long trip in there, and it had I Like to Move It, it had a remix of Dynamite Rave, and it

36:25.060 --> 36:37.180
had, oh yeah, I'm sorry, I said rave. Oh yeah, oh yeah, this rave is heavy. Anyway, but that

36:37.180 --> 36:41.660
That wasn't in there. That song. Sandstorm was not in that list which I thought was interesting.

36:41.660 --> 36:47.700
So I don't know. I don't think anyone at Konami is intentionally messing with us. I don't

36:47.700 --> 36:52.280
think that's the case. So if somebody's saying that list is planted, I think it's BS. I think

36:52.280 --> 36:55.540
somebody at Konami just got lazy, but I don't think it was a finished version.

36:55.540 --> 36:58.620
Gee, Konami be lazy on a DDR mix.

36:58.620 --> 37:04.540
Keep in mind that for demos, for a demo, it's often made off of the working copy.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.540
In USA, hmm.

37:05.540 --> 37:11.380
As an example, I had a demo for Umm Jarmulami when it was being released in the U.S. and

37:11.380 --> 37:12.780
they hadn't finished all their translation.

37:12.780 --> 37:17.300
Well, you can only play maybe two levels in it, but when I went into the XA files, it

37:17.300 --> 37:18.300
had the...

37:18.300 --> 37:22.300
I don't know how many people played Umm Jarmulami, but there was a level that was changed from

37:22.300 --> 37:26.220
the Japanese to the U.S., which was she's playing in hell instead of on an island for

37:26.220 --> 37:31.540
the Teriyaki-Yoko stage, but on that it had the Japanese version for the song lyrics.

37:31.540 --> 37:37.540
But it had everything in there, including lists of tracks and edit information.

38:01.540 --> 38:10.540
Why is that still there? I don't know, but I'm assuming they'll probably take that out, but then again, here's another thing that we have to understand when we're looking at this list.

38:10.540 --> 38:21.540
Even if there were all those short samples, remember back in Extra Mix, there was Petite Love, the short little sample for that, and the banner, and the background stuff, but the song wasn't in there.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.540
So it's possible some of the stuff might be cut out.

38:24.540 --> 38:44.540
Very true, and didn't somebody else hack USA Mix and actually found that there's backgrounds in USA Mix for Butterfly, Bad Girls, and mostly the stuff that they cut out of Best Hits, although I gotta say, the one that was really interesting was Bad Girls because they actually found an image of the background without the gun, and Bad Girls wasn't in Best Hits either.

38:44.540 --> 38:52.540
They also, using a GameShark, were able to have it pull up open slots for songs.

38:52.540 --> 38:58.540
Yeah, well here's my theory on why there's so many songs listed on this thing.

38:58.540 --> 39:02.540
Now, especially Let Them Move. Now this is what made me wonder about this.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.540
Because they guaranteed that Let Them Move would not be in this new mix.

39:06.540 --> 39:10.540
Now, before they were talking about appending this with Konomics.

39:10.540 --> 39:16.540
And if you notice, on the list, which we haven't really kind of revealed the list yet, but you know, if you've seen it on the site,

39:16.540 --> 39:26.540
It has pretty much, I haven't confirmed this by actually going down the list with Conomics and DDR Max USA, but they're almost identical as far as the old stuff that they have.

39:26.540 --> 39:41.540
So, my guess would be is that you can actually append Conomics with Max USA. Now, I don't know if it'll allow stuff to be playable, but that would probably be why they have these short samples on there for that.

39:41.540 --> 39:46.020
We're going to find the list, but we're not going to really read the whole list for you

39:46.020 --> 39:48.780
guys because obviously there's still some tricks to it.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.420
It's not the final list.

39:50.420 --> 39:55.340
Basically we're not going to know until either A, Konami tells us, B, a respectable, reputable

39:55.340 --> 40:03.340
gaming site lets us know the information, or C, we have the hot little game in our hands.

40:03.340 --> 40:07.200
What I do want to read off on that list is the new stuff, the new songs that they've

40:07.200 --> 40:11.780
discovered because I'm guessing that's probably going to be the most accurate.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.900
Why would they have information for new songs if they're not going to be in there after

40:14.900 --> 40:15.900
all?

40:15.900 --> 40:17.580
But the old stuff I'm guessing is not accurate.

40:17.580 --> 40:21.300
Things like Ghost, I have a very hard time believing Ghost is going to actually be in

40:21.300 --> 40:22.300
Max USA.

40:22.300 --> 40:23.300
I could be wrong.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.860
I would love it if Ghost was in Max USA.

40:24.860 --> 40:29.140
That's one of my very favorite DDR songs of all time, but I'm thinking it might be some

40:29.140 --> 40:33.340
kind of copy-over for Max for Japanese, who knows?

40:33.340 --> 40:34.340
That would be my guess.

40:34.340 --> 40:37.720
Then again, they could be licensing it from something else.

40:37.720 --> 40:43.440
So it's very hard to say, but we'll have to just wait until when it comes out for that

40:43.440 --> 40:44.440
kind of stuff.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.820
But like you said, the new stuff for sure.

40:47.820 --> 40:48.820
Very interesting.

40:48.820 --> 40:53.020
What do we got here?

40:53.020 --> 40:58.520
SoCalKick sent me the hacked text file, but again, what I'm seeing on this list, it looks

40:58.520 --> 41:02.300
like codes for every song that you see, but you see things in here listed in here.

41:02.300 --> 41:05.660
This is that part of the text file that had all these things.

41:05.660 --> 41:11.020
You see things that I just don't believe are going to be in Max USA, like Captain Jack

41:11.020 --> 41:15.220
Grandio makes Mr. Wonderful, but look, you see these little three-letter codes before

41:15.220 --> 41:19.900
each one, like FLAS for Flashdance, AFRO for Afrinova.

41:19.900 --> 41:23.460
I think that might have something to do with some kind of pen mode or edit mode, I don't

41:23.460 --> 41:24.540
know.

41:24.540 --> 41:27.540
But who knows?

41:27.540 --> 41:28.540
You know what?

41:28.540 --> 41:29.540
No, Flashdance is not economics.

41:29.540 --> 41:30.540
It's just not economy original.

41:30.540 --> 41:33.540
Why don't you take the import version and see if they also have a similar text form?

42:00.540 --> 42:06.620
coding a lot smaller so that's what that is so what some new songs we see in here

42:06.620 --> 42:12.980
that we haven't seen in DDR yet we've got jam and marmalade logical dash look

42:12.980 --> 42:17.900
to the sky true color mix over blast which has been confirmed peace out I'm

42:17.900 --> 42:23.260
for real the shining Polaris that's what I'm looking forward to drop the bomb the

42:23.260 --> 42:27.140
system SF mix which by the way has been sent to me by JB in the chat room so

42:27.140 --> 42:32.500
we'll play that later dynamite are the down bird soda mix take it to the

42:32.500 --> 42:37.380
morning light extended vocal version you leave me alone dark black forest short

42:37.380 --> 42:44.420
trip nemesis cool ain't it good the original vocal mix m2 step version 1.0

42:44.420 --> 42:50.100
1 22 dunk 5 1 1 abyss baby baby give me your love and I like to move it well

42:50.100 --> 42:55.980
that's baby bit yeah some of those so I don't know something's mixed there's

42:55.980 --> 43:02.580
There's some other ones on there too that you didn't mention up the top there.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.700
There's one of them that's going to be, well look to this guy, true color mix is going

43:06.700 --> 43:08.260
to be in there.

43:08.260 --> 43:12.500
Another one was, let's see, what the hell is that?

43:12.500 --> 43:14.300
I don't know.

43:14.300 --> 43:21.740
It's a dum-s-naha requiem mix, whatever the hell that is, Orion civilization, is that

43:21.740 --> 43:25.520
a remix of, oh whatever, I don't know, we don't know. Anyways, it looks like possibly

43:25.520 --> 43:33.520
an Orion 78 remix, probably not good enough. Anyways, Dark Black Force, of course, you

43:33.520 --> 43:39.360
mentioned, there's a, let's see, you mentioned Drop the Bomb, there's a Do It Right remix

43:39.360 --> 43:42.760
too that's in there. The Strap Battle modes. Oh, where the hell is that? Keep on moving

43:42.760 --> 43:46.800
and let them know the Strap Battle version. Oh, what do we got in there? Second Mix. Let's

43:46.800 --> 43:54.080
here again I think it's just a list of codes I don't think the only things I

43:54.080 --> 43:58.200
see interesting about this are the new songs I don't think this list shows us

43:58.200 --> 44:02.640
it really shows us what songs are going to be a max it's some kind of the

44:02.640 --> 44:07.640
database who knows maybe information modes maybe yeah they have dynamite rave

44:07.640 --> 44:10.480
long version in the list and oops I did it again which are songs I don't think

44:10.480 --> 44:18.560
you're gonna be in there so yeah so I again we're pretty sure we'd say we're

44:18.560 --> 44:22.920
about 90% confident that these new songs are reading to you will show up in max

44:22.920 --> 44:27.000
USA but as for the rest what old stuffs coming back I think it's hard to say

44:27.000 --> 44:30.680
from these hacked ones because again the text files they have everything in there

44:30.680 --> 44:35.040
and it's a working it's a work in progress again sandstorms not in this

44:35.040 --> 44:38.640
list nor the other darud song what's the other darud song you were thinking could

44:38.640 --> 44:42.900
in there? Feel the beat? Feel the beat. Feel the beat is not listed either. So, we know

44:42.900 --> 44:52.900
it's missing something. So, it's got to be a working process. So. But it is pretty interesting

44:52.900 --> 44:58.600
and it does open up a lot of possibilities for things we might see. Alright, cool. What

44:58.600 --> 45:04.140
else do we want to talk about, Max? I played the demo. Let's talk about being a measure

45:04.140 --> 45:09.260
are all about all of my god what what happened wire look to the sky with the

45:09.260 --> 45:10.600
beat of a measure off

45:10.600 --> 45:14.380
i mean it was even a trick they were to rumor is rumor is

45:14.380 --> 45:19.380
that somehow an old version of the demo got put on the demo disk

45:19.380 --> 45:21.180
that they

45:21.180 --> 45:24.660
they actually released a fixed to the playstation magazine people but they

45:24.660 --> 45:26.140
put the wrong one on there

45:26.140 --> 45:28.740
i'll be getting a lot of them

45:28.740 --> 45:30.880
i don't know seems kinda

45:30.880 --> 45:33.840
It's like, gosh, somebody should have known what they were doing over there, right?

45:33.840 --> 45:36.040
You know, how does stuff like that happen?

45:36.040 --> 45:38.220
I know I'll be getting a later issue so I can

45:38.220 --> 45:39.660
confirm or deny that.

45:39.660 --> 45:41.540
It's not a big thing, but...

45:41.540 --> 45:44.860
But no, it was a step off, even to the point where I've been tempted to make

45:44.860 --> 45:51.620
an edit to Let the Beat Hit Em called Let the Beat Hit Em DDR demo.

45:51.620 --> 45:55.020
And now what do you think about playing Secret Rendezvous at home?

45:55.020 --> 45:57.580
Pretty cool, huh? It's a winter song.

45:57.580 --> 46:01.140
and then i think i would think well and that the other than the fact that i

46:01.140 --> 46:03.980
don't like

46:03.980 --> 46:08.460
uh... here's another one that found pretty interesting and i'm off

46:08.460 --> 46:10.820
i see the damn name

46:10.820 --> 46:13.260
okay dynamite are three

46:13.260 --> 46:17.140
uh... down for its so it's a mix

46:17.140 --> 46:18.340
and i'm very

46:18.340 --> 46:22.140
i don't like going on to the other way or after because we're getting a dynamite

46:22.140 --> 46:22.800
are

46:22.800 --> 46:29.800
remix somewhere around

46:35.840 --> 46:37.720
uh... we might

46:37.720 --> 46:40.700
maybe we'll get to hear it at some point i don't know we want you as we hear the

46:40.700 --> 46:42.360
drop the bomb it so i got

46:42.360 --> 46:44.780
i think we should go ahead and play it we're gonna play it will play the drop

46:44.780 --> 46:48.540
the bomb x and then we're gonna talk a little bit about uh...

46:48.540 --> 46:50.760
we'll talk about eight style or something we're not gonna we're not

46:50.760 --> 46:54.440

47:19.840 --> 47:20.840

i've been wishing i mean i i kinda like dynamite are three

47:37.520 --> 47:40.520
but uh... i've been hoping that they do transferring into that

47:40.520 --> 47:41.740
please

47:41.740 --> 47:45.440
be a trans remix not some god damn awful speed mix

47:45.440 --> 47:47.280
or basement

47:47.280 --> 47:52.520
trance remakes that's what i want did we need more booty music in the area

47:52.520 --> 47:56.040

and i want my baby mama

47:58.280 --> 47:59.560
i know i want to have

47:59.560 --> 48:02.520

48:02.520 --> 48:05.100
probably going to be right now

48:05.100 --> 48:07.800
think about it

48:07.800 --> 48:09.700

48:09.700 --> 48:12.560

48:12.560 --> 48:15.480
into it in my baby mama

48:15.480 --> 48:18.760

48:22.280 --> 48:27.200

48:27.200 --> 48:30.720
got clips of this new stuff send them to me now now now now the power of christ

48:30.720 --> 48:33.980
compels me you know it just makes me a little bit upset about my old dead

48:33.980 --> 48:37.740
computer the fact that i have the exit player and uh... excited and three

48:37.740 --> 48:39.520
converters you

48:39.520 --> 48:43.360
i've needed to get all that stuff again

48:43.360 --> 48:47.480
but we love you we love you all listeners for getting us the staff

48:47.480 --> 48:49.720
so yes

48:49.720 --> 48:51.480
are we going to break

48:51.480 --> 48:52.320
let's break stuff

48:52.320 --> 48:56.720
uh... should it be uh... doing my little intro to the song here that was a i want

48:56.720 --> 48:57.420
to talk about

48:57.420 --> 49:01.320
eight style so we'll talk more about itself for the break in itself

49:01.320 --> 49:02.680
but let's talk about

49:02.680 --> 49:06.600
a two d x eight style we've got one new songs been revealed actually two new

49:06.600 --> 49:09.900
songs in revealed and that those of the super secret hidden tracks which

49:09.900 --> 49:10.800
apparently

49:10.800 --> 49:13.160
i i don't know if this is one of the set

49:13.160 --> 49:16.660
had to be detailed again to rule that you have to a beastly basically kick the

49:16.660 --> 49:18.480
crap at a gopin lease you know

49:18.480 --> 49:20.520
uh... you've got to uh...

49:20.520 --> 49:24.740
triple-a a flashing seven song on hard

49:24.740 --> 49:26.960
and then you get to play a song called sakura

49:26.960 --> 49:29.960
doesn't that make you happy i'll never get to play that donald

49:29.960 --> 49:32.480
uh... so you get that

49:32.480 --> 49:34.440
and then if you can triple-a that

49:34.440 --> 49:38.220
if you can triple-a sakura you get a mr t song called xenoan like i said you

49:38.220 --> 49:39.680
have to be dj lisou

49:39.680 --> 49:42.680
and we're gonna play those songs for you right now but loki

49:42.680 --> 49:49.680
has a very interesting theory about sakura which is a song by revenge

49:49.680 --> 49:54.680
I found this link the other day, you know, to find this song, and I listened to it, and I was like,

49:54.680 --> 49:59.680
oh my god, this is Max Unlimited. This song is a remix of Max Unlimited.

49:59.680 --> 50:04.680
No one is saying it is, except for me, but it's a goddamn remix of Max Unlimited.

50:04.680 --> 50:09.680
It has the same bassline as Max Unlimited, almost identical to Max Unlimited.

50:09.680 --> 50:12.680
I mean, if you listen to the key sounds of it, it has the exact same bassline.

50:12.680 --> 50:18.680
Listen to Max Enigma to get what I'm saying, because that's all he has playing in the background, is the bassline.

50:18.680 --> 50:23.320
it has the exact same bassline, plus it's actually got a spot where they could put

50:23.320 --> 50:27.640
freezes. Now what's interesting is, remember when they were talking about Max to the

50:27.640 --> 50:32.160
XXXM and how they said there's gonna be two freezes in it? There's two spots in this song that

50:32.160 --> 50:35.440
could put freezes for it. Also another thing

50:35.440 --> 50:39.160
is there's a part where it speeds up and you'll actually hear the drum that's in

50:39.160 --> 50:40.640
the background of Max Unlimited

50:40.640 --> 50:44.720
and also the bassline too, and at the very end of the song there's a spot where it goes like

50:44.720 --> 50:48.600
da da da, da da da, you know, that type of thing? Right. It's got that there

50:48.600 --> 50:54.600
Now don't be thrown off by the fact that it's got that twangy shit from Nisigaru and all that stuff.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
That's just typical revenge blabber.

50:56.600 --> 51:02.600
First of all, it's not twangy shit. It's traditional playing, so don't, you know, shit on it.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
Okay, it's traditional twangy shit. I'm just kidding.

51:04.600 --> 51:05.600
I'm just saying it.

51:05.600 --> 51:06.600
I'm just kidding to talk about it.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.600
But this is my theory. This song will be the new max.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.600
Screw this max to the XXXM that this...

51:12.600 --> 51:15.600
All this fucking internet rumor shit is really pissing me off.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.920
So some dumb-ass Japanese guy over there comes up,

51:18.920 --> 51:21.380
oh, this sounds like a good name for the next max.

51:21.380 --> 51:22.580
And then puts it out there.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.800
Some idiot copies that list, and then more idiots

51:24.800 --> 51:25.600
copy that list.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.720
And then people start taking that for fact.

51:27.720 --> 51:28.760
And then we copy it.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.640
You hear it here first on Orange Launch.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.060
I never said that that was a song.

51:32.060 --> 51:33.760
It's the dumbest name ever.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.160
Sakura, OK, I am going to put my money on this song.

51:37.160 --> 51:40.000
This is going to be the next max song.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.280
It is the coolest name ever.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.300
And it is going to be the next max song.

51:43.300 --> 51:45.000
I can almost guarantee it.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.200
i'm going to say actually i am going to guarantee this song will be in max three

51:49.200 --> 51:50.000
if not

51:50.000 --> 51:51.720
the extra stage

51:51.720 --> 51:54.760
because who knows they might actually come up with some other stuff for max

51:54.760 --> 51:55.880
three

51:55.880 --> 51:57.540
and we got cockamamie didn't we

51:57.540 --> 52:02.000
i did you can only would like to welcome you to the internet lucky

52:02.000 --> 52:04.080
when it comes to the group

52:04.080 --> 52:09.720
you know that this reminds me of the old picture hello and thank you

52:09.720 --> 52:13.040
tall is yelling at us uh... we love people that

52:13.040 --> 52:18.040
Sakura is a Japanese folk song with the max bass line.

52:18.040 --> 52:24.840
Actually, that was something I played it for my fiancé, Dan, the other night, and he even

52:24.840 --> 52:30.560
mentioned that he heard it in another game that had a level that had traditional music

52:30.560 --> 52:31.560
playing in the background.

52:31.560 --> 52:36.200
And actually, come to think of it, I do remember hearing it before, so that's why I'm personally

52:36.200 --> 52:38.520
a little bit iffy about that theory.

52:38.520 --> 52:43.520
However, I wouldn't put it beyond them to make that a bonus.

52:43.520 --> 52:47.520
Now, uh, how much money are you putting on this, Loki?

52:47.520 --> 52:49.520
I don't know, I didn't say anything about money.

52:49.520 --> 52:53.520
You said you're putting your money on this, that Sakura's gonna be the hidden song.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.520
My credibility, how about that?

52:54.520 --> 52:55.520
Oh!

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
Here's what I'm saying.

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
Your dignity?

52:57.520 --> 52:58.520
Yes, dignity.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.520
And here's another thing!

52:59.520 --> 53:01.520
It's 150 beats per minute.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.520
Oh, wait!

53:02.520 --> 53:04.520
Double that, and what have we got?

53:04.520 --> 53:05.520
300!

53:05.520 --> 53:06.520
Oh!

53:06.520 --> 53:08.700
see that one coming

53:08.700 --> 53:10.200
i mean come on

53:10.200 --> 53:11.400
do we need to like

53:11.400 --> 53:14.520
anymore clues that this is going to be the next max song

53:14.520 --> 53:16.220
okay or if it's not

53:16.220 --> 53:19.620
they get a really shitty ass job with creating a new song let's just take the

53:19.620 --> 53:23.460
baseline from this one and throw some other stuff on top of it oh new song

53:23.460 --> 53:25.100
there you go

53:25.100 --> 53:28.300
i say let's just play it

53:28.300 --> 53:32.720
we first off we did get that clip of dynamite rave we were talking about earlier

53:32.720 --> 53:34.120
uh oh uh oh

53:34.120 --> 53:47.840
I said the word didn't I my bad my bad oh my gosh this tastes like aspirin that

53:47.840 --> 53:51.880
was we got this clip of the dynamite our song now I'm being told though that it's

53:51.880 --> 53:55.680
kind of messed up and kind of scratchy and it's gonna mess up we haven't

53:55.680 --> 53:58.520
screened this yet so we're just gonna play it live on air for the first time

53:58.520 --> 54:02.640
sorry it might be effed up but it's only 15 seconds so deal with it okay here we

54:02.640 --> 54:22.880

54:27.960 --> 54:29.880
don't go out

54:29.880 --> 54:30.360

54:33.360 --> 54:37.480
diaries

54:37.480 --> 54:39.960

54:39.960 --> 54:43.880
yeah minus the fact that it was uh... double your pleasure w fun time uh... it

54:43.880 --> 54:45.500

and you might begin your wish

54:47.160 --> 54:49.880
little fat more like a k o g now i think it

54:49.880 --> 54:51.180
it sounded like

54:51.180 --> 54:52.380
freaking european

54:52.380 --> 54:56.880
all they need to do is just slow it down you know like when you're listening to

54:56.880 --> 55:00.680
the song in 2DX and you put it in training mode and slow it down all the way

55:00.680 --> 55:03.180
it sounds like a ska song they should do dynamite or ska

55:03.180 --> 55:08.780
I don't wanna give up

55:08.780 --> 55:11.180

because jamie demands it

55:23.060 --> 55:27.460

55:27.460 --> 55:29.020
guitar freaks eighth mix

55:29.020 --> 55:29.860
it's uh...

55:29.860 --> 55:30.640

The chat room just gets completely out of hand. They just all at once, they just start getting into it.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.060
They just start yelling out in the chat room. They just all start crying.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.060
They all start crying.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:32.060

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:37.060
This is never going to get old. Never.

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.060
It's ancient. We need to pick a new song on the show.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.060
Booty!

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.060
Our next song on our next live show is gonna be Booty.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.060
Oh, speaking of the next live show...

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060
Speaking of Booty...

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.060
Our show. It's a complete booty.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.060
Next week's show, this coming Sunday show...

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060
Thank you.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:02.060
Next week's show for October the 13th...

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.060
Ooh, lucky day there.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.060
October the 13th show will be pre-taped.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:12.060
So we're not going to be doing it live here in studio, so don't come to the house next Sunday because we won't be here.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:18.060
We're going to pre-tape. We are going to pre-tape I don't know where. Where are we doing? We're doing Scandia?

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:27.060
Scandia. Thursday night, I think? Is that what we decided on Thursday night? Thursday. Thursday, Scandia? Friday's not enough time for me. I want to get out of town by Friday.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.060
Thursday. And then we're going to do it Thursday night at Scandia. Sounds like a plan to me. Winner.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:35.060
So, we will keep you guys posted on the details, though.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.060
It'll be the topic in our chat room.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:42.060
I'll make it the topic in our chat room and I'll post about it on sacbamani.com for the locals,

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.060
because only really people in Sacramento and maybe the Bay would be able to make it to a live taping anyway.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.060
So, we're going to...

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.060
Hey, if you want to be a special guest, show up.

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.060
Yeah, just show up.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.060
If you want to be a special guest, you're in the area.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.060
And give me a dollar!

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.060
And if you're going to be in the Bay area, you can drive on up.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.060
We'd welcome you with open arms.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:05.060
You know, saying open arms makes me think of Journey.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:12.060
I love how I ride to you with open eyes.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.060
Hey, but we have a Journey fan in our chat room.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.060
I fucking love Journey.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:19.060
But you know, it makes me think, I saw this preview on VH1 today.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.060
VH1's going to do like a hundred, the top hundred guilty pleasure songs or something like that.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
And Don't Stop Believin' was in there.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060
Winner.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.060
That song is winner.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.060
I put that song on repeat the other night.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:38.060
Okay, for people who actually read my live journal, I'm going to have to have that as my live journal song for the night.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.060
Okay, good deal.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.060
And we'll have to do our own little guilty pleasure set soon, some week.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.060
We're going to have to do our TDR 2DX guilty pleasures.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.060
Okay, right now I'm commissioning somebody.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:07:01.060
Make me this remix. Make me Dynamite R-thingy mixed with R5. It would sound good.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.060
Dynamite R5.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.060
Dynamite R5.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.060
So would that be...

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.060
Yeah, okay.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:17.060
Yes, Thursday is going to be all about Retro Edit Day. I'm going to bring back all the old fourth mix edits I had.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.060
Cool.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.060
Retro Edit Day. Hell yeah.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.580
If I could come, but I probably can't because it's school. Uh-oh

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.620
No, I would totally play all the edits that are already pre-loaded onto the fourth mix machine like the B4U edit

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.780
They're totally rules, and there are some other ones too. I forget

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:39.700
Don't forget about the edits that are in my pocket. They have the stomp to my beat

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:49.940
So live on Thursday when we tape it Scandi

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.820
I'm going to see if I can make this happen, if I can get a video camera by then.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.300
For those of you that were listening last week, you heard us bitching and bitching and

01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:05.940
bitching about these ignorance, ignoramuses at twingalaxies.com, who do the world record.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.660
Do they conjoin Twin Galaxies?

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.060
No more references to USO.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.820
I'm not allowed to talk about this show on that show, so we have to limit it.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.460
We're gonna quote a, nevermind, Trav if you're listening, you know you're cool.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.780
But you're an asshole for not letting me talk about DDR on that show.

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:28.420
Hey, he talked about the Orange Lounge yesterday.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.540
Yeah, he made fun of it.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.980
But that's still airtight.

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.420
That's still promo.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.940
We're gonna do that live, so it'll be rebroadcast next Sunday.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.460
If I can get the video camera in time, we will do that over there live.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.900
I hope Black Loud can get over there Thursday because I know he's probably going to get

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:48.660
the best score out of any of us that I know of that would show up.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:53.500
We just didn't need to do the Traveling Road Show too, we need to do one from Tapioca Express

01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:01.940
and Davis and you know we'll find that bowling alley in the movie theater in Auburn that

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.020
has the second mix.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.340
How would that be?

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.700
Yes, this record was shattered in a Tapioca Express.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700
That would be winner.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.700
Think about it.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:18.380
That'd be just like seeing, you know, this record was shattered by a paraplegic in a...

01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.620
I shattered this record while eating squid.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:25.660
Well, the record was also set by, like, some total moron, anyway, who made up his own rules.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.260
It's like, okay, here are the rules!

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.260
I win!

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.380
I'm still thinking we need to criticize the rules and send them in and to point out each

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.480
and every reason why they're wrong and why they're idiots.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480
Rule number seven.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480
I can only win.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480
No one else can win.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480
Just me.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.320
D- He's ugly.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.920
Chat room is getting their panties in a bunch cause we haven't done the fus yet.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.560
D- So, we're gonna do the fus right now.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.560
J- Cue my music!

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.560
D- So, Jamie-

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.600
J- I love this game.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600
D- I just wanted to let that little thing do the talking for you.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.640
D- You know, who else likes that thing?

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.640
J- Roo?

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.100
D- Christi's two year old daughter likes that.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.840
J- I just remember having a particular somebody over here humping it.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.280
D- Dude, what?

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.520
J- Nevermind.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520
Shh! What'd Dave do?

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.520
Dude, you are a foul tonight.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.520
You're a foul. You're gross. Okay.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.520
Chili, I'm telling you. The chili and those cheese things.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Yeah. I know.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.520
I can smell it.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.520
Jamie, do you have any FUs of the week?

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.520
Of course I do. Um, as soon as I think of them.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.520
Well, I have my secret FU, which none of you are going to know about.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.520
A few people know about it.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.300
I know I know I know the secret of you. I know it. I know it

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:43.000
So I'm not telling for anybody who wants to know what my secret if you is, you know, try to find me online

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.640
try

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.880
Found you you want orange lounge every Sunday night, bitch

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
I just forget, leave it to me.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.880
Um, no, my other, um, other FDs that I have goes, one of them goes toward voltage, dammit.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.880
You saw me play that song!

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
I did, I did.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.880
You saw how damn close I was to that song.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.880
Um, of course I'm seven feet.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.880
Um, I have another one that, uh, dude, I said what my FDs were at the beginning of the show.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.880
Dammit, I'm not giving up.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.880
Oh yeah, my other fuck you goes toward, well, it's a kinda sorta one.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:25.920
I got a job and I liked being unemployed. I like living off of my own parade for welfare

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.320
I was a welfare. I was an employment. It's different. You know. I'm not you know poop it out, baby

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.240
Lock them up in the closet feeding them you know

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.600
You know five-month-old the funny the funny thing is is if you ever did have a kid

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.600
You would fight with them over who gets to play Nintendo. You really would.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.600
Fuck them, that's mine. I fight for myself.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.600
They want theirs, they can earn their money and fight themselves. Hello.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.600
Anyway, but you know, my job keeps me so busy and I have hardly any time,

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.600
so I'm like this zombie here in the week, and I came in the zombie today,

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.600
and I found, though, I do have a happy thing. I need happy music.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600
A happy thing?

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.600
I have a happy thing.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Oh, happy music, happy music, happy music.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.600
No, I got I got happy music. I'm just looking for it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm looking. I'm looking

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:27.600
I have the perfect I have the perfect song if I can find it. I got it. He's happy song

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.240
Anyway

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.720
My happy thing is I've discovered a wonderful drink get a drink to make it work. It makes me hyper

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:47.720
It's called taking the coffee once the coffee has been brewed and people have poured and there's about half of the container of coffee left.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.720
You pour yourself a cup and add in a pack of hot chocolate.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:57.720
You add in hazelnut creamer and then some sugar. Mix it up and add more coffee and that's instant go-go juice.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.720
It makes you hyper for at least two hours. Top that with penguin mints to get rid of the bad breath.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.720
I get my work done fast.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.720
Fair enough. Any other FUs or

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.720
bless yous or whatever we're calling them?

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.720
Well, other than my secret FU, because I'm not going to be in as much of a bitch as I was earlier.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.720
No. And you know, fuck that!

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.720
And fuck Twin Galaxies. I mean, conjoin Twin Galaxies.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.720
Okay, fair enough. Fuck them. Fuck them right in their nostrils, because their ass ain't good enough.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.720
the

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.420
i'm going to know why it's my turn

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.680
uh... my f use the week

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.140
my own job

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.700
who has moved me to a new cuba that's half the size of my old one

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.900
right in the middle of

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:53.560
fast lane where everybody walks through so i can't really exactly get on the

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.680
internet

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.120
indiscreetly anymore so that's kinda sucks to know i'm not gonna be able to

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:04.120
I might actually have to do work at work, and that's just not right.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120
You can't sit on there like I do.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.120
I know, I hate you. I want your job, except you don't make as much as I do.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:16.120
I don't do anything. I download hundreds and hundreds of megs of stuff on a D1 line.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120
Do you have to take phone calls?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.120
Well, we're supposed to, but we don't have to. If we don't take the call, it rolls over to someone else.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.120
Damn, I want his job, because I don't like talking to people on the phone.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.120
Get me a job.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120
I get tons of ammo.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:37.120
Yeah, I know. You get free shit, too. Man, I hope he's got dream job.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.120
Anyway, I guess that's my only F.U. of the week. I don't think I have any other F.U.s of the week.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.120
It's been a fairly okay week, I guess.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120
F-drama.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.120
F-drama. My life is not passions. I am not living in passions land.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.120
How do you make my life feel like passions?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:06.120
Well, let's see. As promised from last week, I said I would have a nephew this week.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.120
Oh, okay. Yes, you have a nephew.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:18.120
Now, as much as I'd like to learn how to program my remote control and what to do if there's static on my screen and that kind of stuff,

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.120
I don't like the fact that Dish Network took away all my channels.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:30.120
I would turn on the TV this morning and all the channels were locked out because they said that they did not receive payment from us, however we had already paid them.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:38.120
They suck. I have to use the Dish Network because they suck and I don't care how to program my fucking remote and what the hell it can do.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:46.120
And obviously if there was static on the screen I wouldn't know how to get rid of it because I wouldn't be able to see the stupid broadcast about how to get rid of static.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.120
God, I hate Dish Network, although that one chick in the commercial has a nice rack.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.120
She has a nice rack. Nice, nice rack.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:01.120
You heard it here first. The chick in the Dish Network commercial has a nice rack. And now the day.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.120
Yay. I only have a couple of FUs.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.120
You get the same song because I'm lazy.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120
Yeah, okay. I don't want the same song anymore.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120
Alright.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:20.120
My FUs go to 2 EX songs that I can't pass. Mainly, Safari, the shitty EX song and I hate to crap out of it.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:31.120
And Love is Dreaminess and G2. Love is Dreaminess on Seven of Stars, or Seventeen, and the other two on my Seventeen.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.120
I can't pass them, and they are hard. Very hard.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.120
Okay, that's it.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.120
Oh

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:48.000
Well, we're gonna do uh now we have our requested dedication too bad we don't have Casey case in here to do it for us

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.280
I you know, I dedicated the dead airspace on the show to twin, but I feel kind of bad a little bit

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.640
So we're going to dedicate this one song to you

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:14.520
You feel special, you feel loved, good. Thank you. Can we get back to the FUs now?

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.240
All right

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.240
Say the R word.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.240
Say it! Say it!

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.240
Say it!

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.240
I don't want to say the word.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.240
It's a bad four-letter word.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.240
It's a bad four-letter word, okay?

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.240
It's the four-letter R word.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.240
What four-letter R words are there?

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.240
Rave!

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.240
They knew it was coming.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:56.240
See, it's just funny, because every time someone says that, Rob throws his hands up in the air and acts like he's not, like, partying.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.240
It's so funny.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.240
Rob starts doing the club hoochie dance.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.240
I mean, this is a good thing he's not, like, standing up.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.240
I do the I-want-to-get-some-tonight dance.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.240
Okay, we're going to go to the chatroom FUs now.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.240
Uh, oh my god, some people just wrote some fucking novels tonight, so I'm gonna be quick.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.240
Black Lab. Well, Black Lab's cool, so I'll let him have all the FUs he wants,

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240
cause he's, he's whoring out our stations, so...

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.240
Excuse me, excuse me, boys, can I do an FU here? Thank you.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240
Uh, you wanna share with the rest of the network here?

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240
You have enough for everybody!

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.240
Okay, but yesterday at Pat's party, which was awesome,

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:40.240
uh, Loki brought, er, he has got the massive sim, uh, DDR DX or whatever,

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:52.240
And one of the songs is by this one guy, and he basically layered his voice over and over, making all the different noises, the songs like V-X-Y and V.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240
Yeah.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.240
We're gonna get to those.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.240
Yes, later. So, wait.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.240
I now have two microphones. Be scared.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.240
Gimme! My microphone! Here's Robert.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.240

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:35.240
Fuck my bike for getting a flat tire as I left my last class on Friday, thus forcing me to walk at a half an hour across campus back to my dorm.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:47.160
Fuck the T1 line in the dorms for being so overcrowded, 250 or so people share it, and

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.840
No, no, no, this is what BuyRight does.

Every face I see is cold as ice, everything I touch is grey

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.880
Ever since I lost the imagination

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.880
Like a stream that flows into the sea

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.880
I am lost for all eternity

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.880
Ever since you took your love away from me

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.880
Sometimes

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.880
The sound of goodbye

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:54.880
It's louder than any drum beat

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.880
It's so dry

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.880
The sky will be fine

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:21.880
Louder than any strong beat

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.880
The stars, the stars of the stars

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:35.880
I know that there ain't anything wrong with me

01:36:35.880 --> 01:37:02.000
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
No!

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Do we care what people think of us?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
No!

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Yes!

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Alright we are back, this is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 15.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.800
episode number 15. We, as promised, are going to do a listless, one of our favorite segments

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.440
on this show. Why? Because we get to make decisions. And you just have to deal with

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.600
our list. We put it down and we say this is the best or worst ever.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.600
Our word is law.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.600
It is law.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.680
Resistance is futile.

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:55.320
So, but really the final ultimate decision lies with you guys in the chat room. So, get

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.320
into our chat...

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.320
So don't fuck up.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:02.180
our chat room right now at IRC.eggheads.org, channel pound, Orange Lounge, and you can

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:07.420
vote on our list. Basically, the way this list works, we're going to give a topic, and

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.420
then I'm going to give three songs on that topic. We're going to give our top three,

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.780
all the four guests here tonight, Jamie, and then Dave and Loki, we're all going to give

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:14.780
their top three answers.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:15.780
Yes, I am the host.

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.780
You're the host and the guest.

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.780
The hostess, the hostess.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:23.580
I'm sorry, did I put you under, I meant the host, Jamie, and the guests. You can't see

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:37.220
my hand motions, that's why. We're going to be revealing our top three, and then the chat

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.580
room votes. No, then there's the elimination round. Our favorite part, what makes this

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:46.220
game the best. We piss each other off. We piss each other off by taking one off the

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:51.620
list. Then each one of us gets to take one off the list. And then the finalized list,

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.100
you guys vote on and we get a top three right from there what's the topic you

01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:00.460
ask well it's a topical topic what so do you best like to pick your nose to know

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:05.700
it is what it's it's going along with what's being in the Bemani world right

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:11.100
now what Konami original song that's not already in DDR do you want horses we'll

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.620
tell you the topic where we're damn right I'm telling them right now what

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:18.300
Konami original that it hasn't already been in DDR would you most like to see

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:27.300
What did you vote for on the site to determine what song should be in Max 3?

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.300
Konami Original.

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.300
Yes, Dave.

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:30.300
Okay, so this is any...

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.300
Are you Stardius?

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.300
No, it's Konami Original.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.300
It has to be Konami Original.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.300
What's Konami Original mean?

01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:35.300
I'm not...

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.300
Did you already make a list without Konami?

01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:37.300
I think.

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.300
I don't know what the difference is between Konami Original.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300
Oh, my God.

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:40.300
We might have to make a list.

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:43.300
Did you already make a list without Konami?

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.300
I think. I don't know what the difference is.

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.300
Oh my god. We might have to take another break.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.300
Okay, fine. No.

01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.300
Alright, fine. No breaks.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:59.300
Any song in Beatmania that was by Konami, you know, Naoki or something, that hasn't already been in DDR.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:04.300
I'm trying to think if they were by Konami or not. That's the question.

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:07.300
We'll let you know. Don't worry, Dave. We'll let you know.

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.300
Why don't we start with Dave? Dave, what is your number three?

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.300
Okay.

01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.300
Konami original.

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:12.300
The number three choice is V.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.300
Good morning Dave.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300
Is that, does that qualify?

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.300
V, yes, V counts.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300
Yay!

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.300
Yay!

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.300
Yay!

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.300
That'll count.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300
V.

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:21.300
And it's less work for Rob to type.

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.300
Yes.

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.300
It's very little work for me to type.

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:24.300
All right.

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.300
Loki, next!

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.300
All right.

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:32.300
That was a very difficult decision, but I'm going to have to go with instant love.

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.300
Instant love!

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.300
Oh yeah!

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:35.300
I thought that would show up.

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:36.300
Dude, cool.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.300
No, it's not my good cool.

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:41.540
I believe it's by I said dude cool. I said good cool

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.940
Jamie what's your number three choice? Oh any reason why we have to ask the reasons?

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:54.420
Why why instant love because you know if they've got to put let them move in there at least make it a good remix of it

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.340
fair enough

01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:58.340
Dave your reason for me

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:03.180
It's a good song. You know I actually have to vouch for me because for anyone who's played

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:06.740
They'd pump it up.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.380
There basically is winter and pump it up and it's freaking amazing.

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:13.060
So I fully already know what it would be like.

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:21.180
So for my number three choice, I actually have to go with Release Your Mind because

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:24.060
you know, I'm Tac's whore.

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:25.060
Fair enough.

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:27.380
Release Your Mind.

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.020
I'm typing with one hand.

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020
Uh-oh.

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.540
Better get that plastic cover ready.

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.460
Just because TAC owns, that's it? That's your reason?

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:42.060
Because I'm secretly in love with TAC. I guess it's not much of a secret anymore, is it?

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:47.360
You said if for some reason chaos struck the world and it didn't end up that you and Dan

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.540
are together forever, you said you would marry Margaret Cho and TAC. And that's it? Or is

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.060
there another one? I thought there was another one.

01:41:54.060 --> 01:42:01.540
It's TAC. TAC would be my hetero choice and Margaret Cho would be my lesbian choice.

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:08.540
Alright, my number three choice is a rather new choice, but you know what? It owns your soul. It's V35.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:14.540
Because I fucking love that song, it's 8 style, and if you don't like it, you can suck my dick.

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:17.540
Alright, Dave, your number two choice.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:21.540
Okay, my number two choice is Give Me a Sign.

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:25.540
Well, check out this on my fake journey video, how much you like?

01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:26.540
Yeah, cause that song runs.

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.540
I promised I wouldn't sing tonight, I'm sorry.

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.540
And yeah, it would make a good song.

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.540
That's just our little song for tonight.

01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:38.540
Uh, Loki, your number two choice.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:44.540
Dear Diary, today I heard someone like the song that I really didn't like.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:49.540
So I'm gonna go to America and quote, suck his dick.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:56.540
Anyways, now, my number two song would have to be, um, and you heard it during the break, VJ Army.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.540
BJ Army

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:58.540
Ah, BJ Army

01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:03.540
Because there's already a D.W.I. for it out there already and it's an awesome song and

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.080
it reminds me of Wild Rush because it's got a bunch of different styles of music in there

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.080
kind of all blended together.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.220
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up.

01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.220
I like it.

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.220
Thank you!

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:13.220
Jamie, your number two choice.

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:16.660
My number two choice.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:20.580
It would have to be more tack, Indigo Vision.

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:21.580
Indigo Vision.

01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.900
Just because I want to do the freaking da da da da da da da da da da steps, you know.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:31.460
just be so cool fair enough my number two choice and if you don't like this I

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:36.860
kill you you also heard this during the break love is orange that would be so

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:42.660
awesome to dance better than others dreaminess hey now watch out that could

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:53.340
be my number one you don't know fucking love love is dreaminess okay yes one

01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:56.340
Number one, Konami original.

01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:59.340
Drumroll, you hope.

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.340
We'll buzz you, don't worry.

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.340
Wow Wow 70s.

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:05.340
Wow Wow 70s.

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:07.340
Yeah, Sampling Masters, I think they count.

01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.340
Sampling Masters will count, I think.

01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:12.340
Okay, that would be cool just because the afros would be in the video.

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.340
Yeah, and if you listen to it, it would make a really good song for the steps.

01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:19.340
It would go along really well.

01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.340
Wow Wow 70s does own.

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.860
Loki, your number one Konami original ever, ever, ever, ever.

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:30.060
I just love this song, I mean, ever since I heard it.

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:38.300
Outer Limits, because Outer Limits, ah.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.900
I was hoping when you said outer that you'd say outer wall, but...

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.660
Jamie, your number one.

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.620
My number one.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.740
It's a toss up, but I'm going to have to go with Happy Hopper.

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.740
Happy Hopper.

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:59.620
It would just be insane to play, and I'm requiring that you play that during the deliberation

01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:02.500
music because I say so.

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:06.140
My number one, Black Lab, you're wrong, I didn't put Summer Vacation, although that's

01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.140
not a bad idea.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:14.460
My number one is Flotation, oh wait, I fucked up, because that's what I really did when

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.980
I submitted what song, I put Flotation.

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:23.180
But no, my number one is actually 321 Stars.

01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:27.340
That song would own in DDR.

01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.280
And if you don't like it, poo on you.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:37.700
So our full list before we get to our favorite round, the deletion round, is V, Instant Love,

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:46.220
Release Your Mind, V35, Gimme A Sign, VJ Army, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, Wow Wow 70s,

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:52.100
limits happy hopper and 321 stars so now we get to do our favorite part and that

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:58.420
is the deletion round so let's start with Dave Dave what song is so sucky it

01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:01.340

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:14.620
I'm gonna poop on me but 321 star I hate you I hate you die I am gonna cut you

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.180

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.440

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.840
R&B is so forth-mixed, so down with this R&B stuff.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:47.560
Give me a sign.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.120
Unless it's got lesbians in the video.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.920
It's gone.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.640
Yes, I should have picked Summer Vacation.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.800
Oh, well, wah.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.080
I hate to say it, because the list is getting really hard for me

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.280
to choose what to take off.

01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:02.560
And as much as I like the song, I'd have to say Take Off, VJ Army.

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:03.840
Shock, VJ Army.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.720
I'm actually really pissed off at that song right now, anyway.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.560
What's left?

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.120
we've got all these pretty good decent songs left

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.760
uh...

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.640
i don't know this is too hard i can't decide

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.160
i'm going to take off

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:26.460
i'm going to be a complete asshole

01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:30.920
i'd just i'm sorry i don't see this song in ddr no matter what you say

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.940
no matter what you compare it to

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.300
i just don't see the song in ddr

01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:37.300
I'm taking off V.

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.300
You know, it works!

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.300
It's freaking evil in Pump It Up, though.

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.300
I like the rest of the songs there, I just...

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:50.300
V is a 2DX song, it's a keyboard mania song, it's not a DDR song for me, so...

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:52.300
Wait till you see it in motion, that's all I have to say.

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:55.300
You need to see someone play that on Pump It Up.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.300
You need to see someone play it on Pump It Up.

01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.300
Down with V.

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.300
That goes back to the Vegas trip.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:04.300
I'm just taking out my personal frustrations out on V, too, because I can't pass it still.

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:11.300
That just goes back to the DDR Freak Moderator's Vegas trip. We're watching Blue, you know, practically full combo it.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:16.300
I'm going to be laughing on Wednesday when they announce V as the new song in DDR Max 3.

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.300
I will be cheering that day.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:24.300
I'm just going to, you're going to see me post on the board instantly and just go, ah, very ironic there. Okay, anyways.

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:27.300
And I'll just say, fuck you.

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.300
We'll be like, heh heh!

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:41.300
So, here's the full list. I'm posting it to the chat room right now and then you can send me your votes, except I'm having to clear out the messages I've already gotten here. I've got to clear these out.

01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:46.300
Okay, here we go. Here's your choices. You want to read that off, Jamie?

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:49.300
Of course, as soon as you pull the thing up and un-dark it.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:57.900
We have Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, WellWow70s

01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.660
Afro, Outer Limits, and Happy Hopper.

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.840
And on a personal note, I'd just like to say that everything that I picked is still there.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:04.840
You know what though?

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:05.840
You know what though?

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.500
Honestly, Jim, now that I'm looking at the list again, I probably should have taken off

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.860
Release Your Mind, I think, now that I'm looking at it.

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:10.860
But oh well.

01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.860
Too late.

01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:12.860
What's done is done.

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:18.900
I did V. So send me your votes over private message, and you've only got a minute and

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.980
to have to do it, because we've got to hurry up and end this show, because I've got to

01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:26.940
get out of town. So, we're going to play Happy Hopper, because Jamie said so, and we'll be

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.940
We'll be right back, cause you only got a minute and a half, so I don't know if it was now, now, now, now, now.

01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:00.940
Every night, a little every night

01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:04.940
Oh, every day was of every theme

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:08.940
Every night, a little every night

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:14.940
Oh, every day was of every theme

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:22.940
Hachi de ustedashi kamebo setu

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:54.940
You are my sunshine

01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:56.940
You are my sunshine

01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.940
You are my moonlight

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.940
You are my heart

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:02.940
You are my dream

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.940
YEAH!

01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:36.940
Every night

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.940
I hear your voice

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.940
Baby, every day

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:47.940
And every night

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.940
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor,

01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:00.940
what do you think of the Orange Dance for the Money Music and More show?

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:08.940
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.940
It's unearthly.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:15.940
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:17.940
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:20.940
We're back to wrap up this little train wreck we've got going,

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.940
and we're going to do that by revealing the top three winners.

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:28.940
And we had a pretty good tie going there for a while, but we did resolve it.

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.940
It did resolve. We have four songs all tied to one point.

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:32.940
Yes.

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:37.940
But we had somebody change their vote, which really kind of just did it right there.

01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.940
It kind of broke all the ties we had.

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:41.940
And now we have the final list.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:47.940
This is the Konami original we most want to see in Max 3 through the voting.

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:50.940
Wow Wow 70s is in third place.

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:51.940
Yay.

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:52.940
Afro.

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:53.940
Afro.

01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:56.940
In second place, Outer Limits.

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.940
Yay!

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.940
Oh, I sense a personal grudge.

01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.940
You're just pissed because I took V off.

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.940
Bitch.

01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.940
In first place...

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.940
This is the only drumroll I have, so deal with it.

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.940
Happy Hopper wins!

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:17.940
Because I roll and I have good taste.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.940
Happy Hopper is the...

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:25.940
And you know, we're actually somewhat unsure if that's economy original, aren't we?

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:29.540
Kind of unsure, but we're just going to say it is.

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:31.580
I would like to play Tetris while playing Happy Hopper.

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.100
It wins, so Happy Hopper wins, because we said so.

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:36.860
We said so.

01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.140
So we're going to have to kind of wrap up the show here.

01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:42.580
We're coming into the last home stretch here.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.740
Just want to remind everybody that Sunday's show

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:46.500
will be pre-taped.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.620
Come on into the chat room.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:50.100
Our regulars will be there and talking about the pre-taped

01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.060
show as it's going on.

01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:53.120
If you live in the Sacramento or Bay Area,

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.620
join us at Sacramento Scandi.

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:59.580
I believe that's going to be Thursday night, but please, please check the forums on sacbamani.com

01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.580
for any changes.

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.580
Um, Chat Room, praise y'all?

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.000
No, praise me.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.820
And Instant Love came in fourth.

01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:11.000
Instant Love was the one that was also tied in there, by the way, but somebody changed

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.060
their vote from Instant Love to something else.

01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.420
It was winning for a while.

01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:16.780
Yeah, it was winning for a while, and then a bunch of people changed their votes, so

01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:17.780
whatever.

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.780
You guys are interesting.

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.780
Sorry, DJ Konami.

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:20.780
Sorry.

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.780
We still love you.

01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:23.300
DJ Konami was the only one that ended up voting for Instant Love.

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:25.380
else to change our votes.

01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:27.260
Yes, the dance floor is waiting for you.

01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:30.140
Another reminder, I'd like to also apologize.

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.020
Thursday's rebroadcast didn't happen.

01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.980
That was my fault, because work got in the way

01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:37.140
and I wasn't able to queue up the replay in time.

01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.180
So I apologize to those of you that

01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:40.100
were listening Thursday for the rebroadcast.

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.780
But we will do this Thursday's rebroadcast at 2 PM,

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:48.140
along with our Monday broadcast at 7 PM, our rebroadcast.

01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:52.500
And Saturday, there will be no Orange Lounge at all,

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.700
because Live 365 will be down.

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:58.020
So every Live 365 station will be off air that night.

01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.220
They're moving to an underground bunker server.

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.700
Yes, they're moving to an underground bunker

01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.500
so that Britney Spears and all those people doing

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.940
the commercials, Stevie Wonder and all them can't get to them.

01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:09.700
Yeah, Stevie Wonder can't find us.

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:12.820
Dude, Britney Spears is a rabbit, she'll bite one of them.

01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.740
And give them herpes.

01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:17.300
Or herpes.

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.220
Also known as cold source, no, I don't think so.

01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:23.220
She's going to give them little icky-crawly things.

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:24.220
Ew!

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.220
Oops!

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.220
I did it again.

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:27.220
What can I say?

01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:28.220
Um...

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:29.220
Gosh, what else?

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:35.300
Remember, you can get an STD by playing DDR Max.

01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.220
We got to get this thing wrapped up, so some final thoughts?

01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:39.220
Jamie, you got any...

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.220
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:41.220
You have an oo.

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:42.220
You have an oo, Matt?

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:46.900
Where are we going to play the stupid song?

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.580
We're going to have to bump that to next week.

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:49.580
Okay.

01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:53.100
We were talking too long about, I don't know, what were we talking too long about?

01:56:53.100 --> 01:57:00.420
Dear Diary, I made the Stupid American Show last too long because my segment was just

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.420
as mental.

01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:05.820
Yeah, we bitched about DDR Max USA for too long and all that controversy going on there.

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:08.180
And don't forget about conjoined twin galaxies.

01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:14.300
Yeah, and while we're queuing up the end of the show here, some update, nothing really

01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.300
going on.

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:20.180
the DDR, or the Dancing Stage Hero Mix 2 DWIs out there, so look for them, find them, they're

01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:25.460
pretty fun to play, really easy. Other than that, DDR spot's still down, still waiting

01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:29.740
for them to come up, I don't know why. I should have asked, you know, Mike Noah's in town,

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.740
I should have asked him, because he was right there, but I didn't even think to ask. I missed

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:36.940
that site. My bad. So that's down, really the only other news that we have to wait for

01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:41.620
is, you know, what new song's going to be announced on Wednesday. That's about it. Pretty

01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:48.620
Okay, any final thoughts from you, Dave?

01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:55.620
T'Chaka owns, and my word of the week is philosophical, because if you were at the party last night,

01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:57.620
you know what I mean.

01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:01.620
Yes, and I'd also like to announce that I'll be doing news on Team Guilo now that they're

01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:02.620
back up.

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.620
Yay!

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.620
Does that make you a member of Team Guilo, or is that what you're doing news?

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:06.620
I never understood how their team works.

01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:09.620
They should have given me stickers and bribed me with stickers and stuff.

01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.620
Well, that's cool.

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.780
i don't know they had to

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:15.980
you gotta work in some plugs for orange launch okay good boy

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:18.220
all right we like them we like getting plugs

01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:23.220
and uh... my final thought of the week

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.740
uh...

01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.740
uh...

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:31.740
uh...

01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:34.740
uh...

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:38.740
uh...

01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:52.020
I was patting, we were just scrubbing, and patting, and hah, hah, hah, don't hurt me.

You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:59.300
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:05.700
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts,

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.380
also known as Sky.

01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:11.660
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:15.060
If you like guns, if you like shooting, if you like action, and if you're going to rent

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:19.660
the movies, rent them at Tam's Video on Irving and 22nd.

01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.660
What is your membership number?

01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.660
I don't know.

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:32.660
I don't know is your membership number?

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:43.460
Because I don't believe you've really had the San Francisco experience until you've

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:50.100
been abused by a Chinese person.

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:54.540
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
