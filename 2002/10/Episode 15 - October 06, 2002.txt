I guess there's just two kinds of people, Miss Sandstone.
My kind of people and assholes.
One.
One.
He's good.
Missed it by that much.
That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How can you tell?
I never forget a pussy.
I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.
DarkSakura I hate nature!
I just wish the world would explode!
And then I could take over hell!
Sky Do I look like the weather girl?
Everything alright?
Yep, two corpses, everything's fine.
Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 15 for October the 6th of 2002.
You're tuned into the Bimani Sing's most super-duper radio station of all things Bimani.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always is our resident Happy Bunny.
Everyone, please say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
Hi.
You sound so weak tonight.
You sound weakened.
Hi!
DarkSakura needs food badly.
I had cupcakes.
That's my crack.
Now I have vanilla crack.
I've had nothing.
Did you have a ho-ho?
I don't need no ho, thank you.
What are you calling a ho-ho?
I can lay for free.
I can already tell it's going to be one of those nights.
Small, intimate little gathering tonight.
We've got our loyals here.
We've got Loki, who I don't think has missed a show yet.
No, I have not.
You're so cool.
And Loki, by the way, knows how to kiss some host ass.
We'll get into that later in the show.
How Loki won some major brownie points with Jamie and I tonight.
And of course, there's the always running into the last second he possibly can.
Dave, how you doing?
It's not my fault.
I wanted to go earlier, but my dad's like, hell no, I'm watching football game.
Damn, that's a soft drone.
Damn it.
Hey, that's a soft drone.
That's cool.
Okay, so we'll be talking to everybody else a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do some more of Jamie's picks.
That whole last hour was just nothing but Jamie picks.
It's special.
We're doing more Jamie picks.
How is it special, Jamie?
This particular one is one that I talked about last week.
It's basically Osamu Kubota and Tack live doing Presto and Era.
And the one after that is a song that's from Beatmania Final.
It's the Naoki track.
Sounds very good.
We're going to hear those.
And later on, we're going to be talking lots and lots and lots about Max USA.
Tons of news on that coming up.
And we'll talk about 8th Style.
We'll see if we can get Naoki Journals, your FUs of the week, and just a ton of shit tonight.
So tell everybody to listen.
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
Dear Diary.
Dear Diary.
Orange Lounge is cool.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Nico Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, Ash!
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
Yes, that was very random.
Thank you.
Ash, Ash.
We have Jazz in the chat room tonight.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello to everybody.
We are very glad to have you back in the chat room.
Hello to everybody in our chat room.
We've got lots of people in there tonight.
And if you want to join our chat room, you've just got to go to any OtherSideIRC server like irc.eggheads.org or carma.othersideirc.net and you're just going to join Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
And we expect you a nice play again.
Yes.
So, wow.
Wow, big...
How was your week?
Let's transition our way into the show here.
Dad's going to go into my fuck you of the week, so we should hold on to that.
I'm going to tease our show, because we usually do fuck you's of the week, like, first thing right away.
I'm going to tease them.
I'm going to do it maybe the second half of the show, just because I feel like it.
I don't feel like doing the fuck you's right now.
Yes, we're evil.
We're going to make you wait.
I have some thank you's of the week, though.
I've got plenty of happy news for this week.
You don't need happy.
We need pissy.
I want to be happy.
I've got lots of happy news to... Well, as we mentioned before we went to break, Loki knows how to kiss some host ass around the show.
Got Jamie and I some advanced copies of Notorious CHO on tape.
How cool is that?
Thank you!
And what else?
Walgreens.
Last Minute Junk Food around about 15 minutes before I came here.
And Vanilla Crack.
And yes, Vanilla Coke.
And there was something else I wanted to thank.
I forget what it was, though.
I would like to thank Air for being there for me to breathe.
Rob wanted to thank me for being beautiful and inspirational.
I'm like a muse.
Here he comes, Mr. Orange Lounge.
By the way, that's the only time you're going to hear me sing on this show.
Unless you do your Let Them Move Elmo mix.
Oh, God.
That's old school.
That is old school.
I haven't done the Let Them Move Elmo mix.
The only reason I don't do the Let Them Move Elmo mix on this show, because I know Twen would get a hold of it and make some nasty remix out of it.
So, I'm just withholding the Elmo bit.
So...
Back in the news about DDR, Bimani.
How was your week?
How was your week in the Bimani world?
I heard you had some accomplishments this week.
Okay, well, I tried to stop counting how many 9-footers I was doing, but I'm still kind of excited about it because I did so many in a row.
And I finally owned Twilight Zone.
And then me being the big idiot that I am, decided to do So Deep, and my legs gave out from under me.
Yeah, pretty far though, I was watching you do that.
We were all, like, I don't know if you know, but Irene, myself, and Brad, we were all kind of huddled in the corner watching you do it.
We were like, oh, oh, oh, oh!
My legs actually, you know when you get so tired that your legs just get really stiff after playing DDR?
That happened to me and I could not move, I actually had to grab the bar.
and, you know, the bar for me, I usually treat it like it's, you know, made out of feces or something.
Oh, accomplishments, I passed two seven stars on 2DX, yay.
Absolute and Buffalo, and they were cool.
Buffalo!
Yeah, that song was cool.
But I tried many more, but I failed them all.
I'm not good enough yet.
Not until I can pass all of them.
Be for you, another.
Try Y31.
Y31 is easy, try it.
But I can't have it yet.
I was very, very happy today.
I passed a 7-star in 2DX and I wanted to pass it for a long, long time at sync.
And I did Summer Vacation a couple days ago, too, which is Flashing 7.
That made me happy.
Apparently my controller is blessed.
Your controller is the bomb diggity.
My 2DX controller kicks everybody else's controller's ass.
And, you know, I'm still pissed off about my arcade controller.
Why is that?
Because KonamiStyle hasn't emailed me back to let me know it's being re-delivered.
Fuck Konami!
Oh, wait, we're not there yet.
Wait, why does your controller kick ass?
Because my controller has magical powers.
I can only pass Summer Vacation on her controller.
I can't do it on my own controller.
I can only do it on hers, because hers goes clacky-clacky-clack, and mine just goes...
My controller stuck for like a week and then I bitched at it and it unstuck and has been beautiful ever since.
Oh, because I was playing on Scott, White Freestyle or whatever, his 2DX controller and he said that he like shaved it down or something and it worked perfectly.
It was pretty cool.
I'm not raping my controller yet.
Yeah, I don't know, but it worked and it didn't stick at all, so.
I'm scared to open up my controller and give it an operation, because I don't know, if you ever played that game Operation, I was so horrible at it, and I'm afraid I'd do the same thing to my 2DX controller, that the big red light would go off and go... Let me fix your controller.
Oh, you're going to fix my controller?
I will use the power of my bitchiness on your controller.
I will put the fear of me into your controller.
Are you just going to lay it on the ground and just go... I command thee to work!
Be healed!
The power of Christ compels thee.
The power of Christ compels thee.
Demon be gone from this controller.
I hope my roommate didn't decide to go to bed early tonight.
Oh, okay, good.
Good thing.
If he's smart, he got out of the house.
I don't know.
I didn't see him.
Oh, I'm getting a suggestion in the chatroom that when I play Operation, I should take out the battery and I'll win every time.
Oh, winner.
You know what I do?
What?
I pick up the thing and dump it upside down.
I wonder if you could do that with patience.
You should be a doctor, Jamie.
You'd make tons of money.
Hey!
We need to say hi.
A big special hello to our buddy, Sharks Girl.
Hi, wifey poo.
Just for you, baby.
Hi, Rose.
Dear Diary, I've got a donut with your name on it.
It made me feel all tingly.
I don't want to talk Bomani tonight.
Let's just sit here and ramble.
Dear Diary, I decided that I was going to be a hockey fan.
Yay!
You know, I swear to God, Naoki and Michael Jackson have got close relatives.
I mean, they're both hideously feminine.
Do you remember the rumor that Naoki was supposed to be one of the hidden members of B4U?
I'm still convinced that he's a woman.
Thank you.
That burp was brought to you by a vanilla Coke.
It's got that chili flavoring to it that I had earlier today.
And now it's all over the mic.
Ew, it's Rob's mic.
And I want to thank Del Taco.
Del Taco owns.
That's all I want to say.
Thank you.
All you people who ate real food today.
I've had a donut, string cheese, and cupcakes.
Whee!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, and the all-important bottle of Propel.
I'm on the supermodel diet right now, where I have a cigarette for breakfast and two shots of tequila for dinner.
What were you saying, Dave?
For the sake of internet radio, I say that we get back to anything relevant.
Yeah, fuck him.
No, fuck Bomani.
Stop playing DDR.
That's our advice.
Get your life back.
Save your podiatrist the trouble.
Don't turn out like us.
We're nerds.
Help us.
So anyways, yesterday, went to an awesome party for Pat.
Hey, Pat's cool.
I missed going.
I wanted to go.
His birthday.
So we went and we played the DDR sim, of course.
The giant DDR sim.
It's all about Super Shuffle.
Super Shuffle.
Now, if you've ever wondered what is... What, pray tell, is Super Shuffle?
Super Shuffle is what Shuffle should be.
It's where every single step is random.
And then what's fun is Shuffle works in doubles.
So playing Super Shuffle in doubles is like playing Twister.
No, and see how Freeze Arrows work is...
Freeze arrows are set when the next arrow comes up.
So normally in a song, they have the specific ending, and then the next note comes up under it.
But since there's no note coming up under it, the freeze arrow just keeps going.
You might have to hold, in doubles, eight freeze arrows.
It happened last night.
Scott had to hold all eight arrows.
He failed that song, but it was funny.
That's when you have an orgy on the dance pad.
You know what, Loki, I'm not playing on your metal pads again until you get the Spider Stomp sim.
Rock on!
Spider Stomp!
Fuck Blamati, it's all about Spider Stomp.
Well, hi-ho on doubles is actually pretty much like Spider Stomp, it's just all jumping.
Could you imagine how fucking horrible Golfland would be if, well, you know, even more so Golfland horrible?
No!
Even more so if fucking DDR spat out tickets Dude, I would be walking out of there with scooters every day I know, but think about just how horrible the lines would be If DDR spat out tickets, it's over, I quit
Do you know how much free, useless shit that we have?
Like, I'd have a million little blinking Raver lights, and like five skateboards, and oh my god, I'd spend so much money on that game, even if I only got one ticket for every time I played, I'd still have a ton of shit.
It's about time they give me something back for the money I spent on that damn thing.
You know, you get it.
I'm sorry, Dave.
Did somebody say Raver?
Did somebody say Raver?
It's like being in a rave!
Did somebody say rave-er?
Aw yeah!
I love you guys!
I love you!
Aw, I love you Jamie!
Aw, give me a uh, man!
Aw, this is some good shit!
Okay, let's get this train back on the rails here.
Should we talk about... This is what we get for having all that sugar before the show.
Yeah, but I didn't, see, so... Should we talk about the weekly... You ate Cheetos, those are weak sauce.
So what?
They're orange, it's themed.
Okay, okay.
From now on, whenever anyone starts talking about raves on this show, I'm going to play Sandstorm.
Coming to a max, USA near you.
We think.
We're pretty sure.
We hope.
It's confirmed, damn it.
So, none of that.
Anyway, your little precious update.
Yes, our update.
Naoki spouted off his little crap today, but we didn't really care about what he had to say.
All we cared about is the new information about DDR Max 3, which is that non-stop modes will be making a return.
So, hooray for non-stops, I guess.
So, I guess that'll be fun.
Also, going to be, actually, not really news yet, but it's coming, is next week they're going to announce what song won the vote for, that's actually going to be in Max 3.
One song?
One song is going to win the vote?
No, they're announcing one song next week.
And they're going to continually announce songs each coming week.
So next Wednesday, okay, I believe it's the 9th, they will have the next song for DDR Max 3, which I've heard is going to be Let Them Move.
Okay.
Saying rave in the chatroom doesn't count.
It has to be in the studio, so quit it.
Jamie, quit playing with the ferret.
There's celebration in the chatroom saying, yay, I won't fail Oni courses with 3.1 anymore because non-stops are back.
Yay!
What song do you think will be announced?
What do you think the first Oni original will be?
V?
V?
I think it's going to be V. That's where my money is.
I would hope, I'm praying, that it's Instant Love.
Yes, Instant Love!
Hey, I'll have you know, I voted for that.
So, if it is, I'd be so pleased.
It used to be me.
Instant Love, clear cookies.
Instant Love, clear cookies.
Instant Love, clear cookies.
I swear to God, I'm such a fucking retard, okay?
I went to the site to vote for a song.
I voted for Flotation.
Flotation.
The Beginning of a Prologue
Ooh.
Second mix represents the beginning of Naoki.
What about first mix?
Was that not Naoki?
See, I've been saying this.
Because I'm brilliant to you.
Naoki in a dress.
Ah, man Naoki.
Okay.
So, because of Brilliant To You, a song which quickly gained support of DDR players during its production.
This is the best song ever.
That's because it was like one of the eight songs on second mix.
Anyways, so, gained the support of DDR players during the production.
In respect to music producer who played a large part in its production, you credited the song in your own name, Naoki.
Okay, is he talking in third person now?
Okay, the song expresses you perfectly.
It's the kind of song that makes a very pleasant sensation.
As if the bewitched melody of synths is flowing from the very center of your body.
I have to interrupt for a second just to say, if you don't like second mix, if second mix does not own your soul, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you a hundred times over.
Second mix is ownage.
Jamie and I say so, therefore it is true.
The end.
And because we're on the radio, you have to believe everything you hear.
Strictly business, like what?
No, brilliancy, orchestra, groove.
Fucking tub thumping, that's all I have to say.
Best freestyle ever.
Fuck you.
Anyways, I'll never forget the pleasant sensation held by this song.
And so I try to continue...
I tried to continue reproducing it.
Incidentally, next time I feel I achieved this was in Dynamite Rave.
That's no surprise.
That's no surprise.
Uh-oh.
We did say Rave.
Uh-oh.
Oh, yes.
You said Rave.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, man.
This is so sweet.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Oh, I'm seeing so many colors, man.
This DJ.
Oh, I love the DJ.
Oh, praise the DJ.
Oh, man.
Oh, fuck.
Wait, what the hell just happened?
We have a word of the day.
We have a word of the day.
And whenever the word is said, we play that song, coming to a USA mix near you, and have our own little... The magic word is rave.
Leave now, save yourselves.
Anyway, back to the Naughty Diary.
Back to where I was going here.
Well, let's see here.
Since the second mix, music technology hasn't advanced, but your range of songs is much wider.
Listening to the soundtrack... Your stupid rave stuff is throwing me... He said it, he said it!
What the hell?
Wait.
What happened?
Oh my...
from now on it's just going to be called Dynamite R3
Sounds good, okay.
Alright, let's see here.
Listening to the soundtrack now, how do you think that has evolved since these early roots?
Looking back and reflecting on music, second mix, it brings to mind songs like Higher, Baby Give Me Your Love from fourth mix.
In fact, these songs feel like second mix.
I haven't really noticed any... Okay, whatever.
Anyways, there's a strong connection between the music in these two games.
Yeah, because it's the same game.
It's the same guy making it.
Anyways, time has shown that Second Mix was a huge success.
The Second Mix soundtrack CD sold over 550,000 copies, all for Butterfly.
Yes, all for Butterfly and that Dynamite R3.
Anyway, so with the success of... Third mix.
Whatever.
With the success of second mix, Lifting My Spirits, everything seemed to pass very quickly.
And before I knew it, I was working on solo bass mix, third mix, and True Kiss Destinations all at once.
DDR was really starting to take off.
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What did he write for True Kiss Destination?
Wasn't that all their own stuff?
True Kiss Destination had Sexy Planet and Celebrate Night.
I got it backwards.
I thought that the other one, Dreams Come True, had the Naoki tracks in it.
Ah, Dreams Come True sucks.
But it was a good Beatmania mix.
Good point.
Very good point made in the chat room.
550,000 sold, 1 billion pirated.
Anyways, some more stuff about the non-stop.
They've got, it's going to be four songs in one chorus, a life gauge, just like normal non-stops, and it looks like the highest score you can get is 100 million points.
How many pirated copies?
The second mixer award.
Thank you.
Hey, I had mine on Dreamcast.
I'm sure that guy that holds the world record is going to get 101 million.
Oh, yeah, dude.
Our Twin Galaxies world record holder is going to get 300 points, and he's going to be the fucking world record holder.
And then there's, okay, and then on Naoki's little journal there's some other crap.
I don't know what it is about.
It looks like how you play with freeze arrows or something.
It's how to dance like Naoki.
You okay?
You're gonna find what?
Oh, you're gonna find the translator?
Do you want me to go to break or something?
Yeah, but it looks like it has something to do with the use of freeze arrows, like how they're inputted into the game.
I'll try to come back with a translation of this after our next break.
It's pointless information.
No one cares.
We can see by what Afro is doing, he is playing with a blank screen.
So obviously he's not too smart to begin with.
So we don't really care what's going on there either.
Then they have some stupid like, oh, this is a logo for Secret Rendezvous that didn't make the game.
Oh, cry.
Don't care.
Okay.
Sniff.
I kinda like that logo, it looks like it's pavement.
Like this game is hitting the pavement.
Pavement, girls on couch.
Pavement, girls on couch.
It's a country couch!
Girls on pavement.
Now you're getting somewhere.
Their house could have pavement on the floor, okay?
They didn't show the floor, they just showed the couch with the girls.
So there.
It can be like, wait, it can be like Night at the Roxbury.
They have the inside-out nightclub.
And then they have, I almost said it, but I didn't.
What?
What did you all just say?
No, no, no, wait, hold on, hold on.
Because that logo that you see before you start the song, I think that's what this was supposed to be.
And you know, like, before you start the song, all the logo is, it just says, you know, Secret Rendezvous written in the neon thing, and then, you know, Divas.
So I don't know, in that aspect, I think that logo's kind of cool.
At least it has a little arrow drawn on it or something.
It's not that plain, but... But the lesbian video rules.
Yeah.
Lesbian video rocks.
Anyway, so just, we'll have to stay tuned for next, uh, for Wednesday, actually, for Nike Journal 3, where he'll be talking about what he has for breakfast, and... His new underwear.
Yeah.
Pauly Terry.
Pauly, Pauly, Pauly Terry, and how he stalks her, and...
I got the idea from my good friend, Mickey.
Now, obviously, we slept together, and not together, you know what I mean?
Because I don't swing that way.
Speaking of secret rendezvous, we're going to kind of transition to another topic here.
As you probably know, the original PlayStation Magazine demo of DDR Max USA hit shelves this week, and one of the songs in it
is Secret Rendezvous.
Now, one of our pals in the chat room, JB, took a really interesting picture.
I want to show you guys.
Shit, I already lost the link.
JB, post that link in the chat room once you hear the picture so I can show that.
And then everybody in the chat room can see it too.
It's just a really funny picture about the demo.
I want to show you guys as soon as JB posts the link here.
Hopefully he's not a minute lagged like some of the people in our chat room.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, now what do you have to say about the lesbian thing?
Because they are secret lovers.
I knew it all along.
Sheesh.
Anyway.
You know what?
You know what?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Glenn raises a very good point.
What the fuck are we saying?
That's not even in alphabetical order.
That picture is obviously photoshopped by somebody, right?
Wouldn't it be?
Or they thought it was funny too.
Yeah, that would have to be photoshopped.
Let me take a look.
Boy, we're easily fooled on this show.
Yeah, it's got to be photoshopped because E doesn't come after L. Maybe not.
It would also be funny if it was ESL.
Yeah, ESL, you know.
Because most of the people at Konami must be taking ESL.
They teach it in high school.
Maybe they're all still in high school.
Anyways, yeah, so one of the things that they did with this Max demo is they hacked into it and found the song list.
Hooray.
So we actually have the song list.
Well...
It's debatable, and this is a huge debate.
We're not going to get it resolved on this show.
There's people saying, yes, that's the list.
There's people saying, no, that's not the list.
And yes, that's the list.
And no, that's not the list.
And yes, that's... You know, it just keeps going back and forth.
But... What?
Theory?
Okay, let's hear the theory.
Let's hear an interesting theory.
DSCS SoCalKick says that it is fake.
Again.
Yes, it's the list!
No, it's not the list.
Yes, it's the list!
And DJ Konami says, no, it's not.
Why don't we just put in the demo and try it ourselves?
That's what I'm saying.
Okay, supposedly, here's how they got the list, okay?
They went in to the XA file, which is the PlayStation audio format, you know, that they use.
Now, in those, you can actually listen to the small little samples of sounds that'll play when you select a certain song.
Now, supposedly, since they hurried to get this demo done so fast, they didn't bother to cut that out.
I mean, most average people are going to go, oh, I'm going to go hack into this and go listen for songs.
So, what happened was that someone did that.
Which just proves that people that play DDR are sick fucking people.
Yeah, so what happened... For any demo they're going to do, they're just going to lock out the other stuff.
Or remove it.
So, what they did was they went in there and actually listened to all that.
Now, I'm not sure if there was an actual song list.
I don't believe that there was an actual song list there.
But perhaps they identified stuff based off of what they heard on there.
I mean, some of them obviously pretty obvious, like Sandstorm and, you know, stuff like that.
So...
I opened up a file in a notepad there was some file in there that you could open up a notepad and it shows you a big list and it looked like every single freaking song that's ever been in DDR like it was for either some kind of append or it was like all the four letter edit codes which that's what I thought it was it was all the four letter edit codes because it had like Mr. Wonderful and things like that that I know are not going to be in Max that things are not going to be in Max USA but it also had new stuff it had the short long trip in there and it had I Like To Move It it had a remix of Dynamite Rave
and it had, oh yeah, I'm sorry, I said rave.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, this rave is heavy.
Anyway.
But that wasn't in there.
That song.
Sandstorm was not in that list, which I thought was interesting.
So I don't know.
I don't think anyone at Konami is intentionally messing with us.
I don't think that's the case.
So if somebody's saying that list is planted, I think it's BS.
I think somebody at Konami just got lazy, but I don't think it was a finished version.
Gee, Konami be lazy on a DDR mix.
Keep in mind that for demos, it's often made off of the working copy.
In the USA, hmm... You know, as an example, I had a demo for Umjir Marlami when it was being released in the US and they hadn't finished all their translation.
Well, you can only play, you know, maybe two levels in it, but when I went into the XA files, it had the, um... I don't know how many people played Umjir Marlami, but there was a level that was changed from Japanese to the US, which was she's playing in hell instead of on an island for the Teriyaki Yoko stage, but on that it had the Japanese version for the song lyrics.
and so on and so forth.
Then I would have to go and believe it.
Now some of the things that surprised me on there, well for one is let them move.
Why is that still there?
I don't know, but I'm assuming they'll probably take that out.
But then again, here's another thing that we have to understand when we're looking at this list.
Even if there were all those short samples,
Remember back in Extra Mix, there was Petite Love, the short little sample for that, and the banner, and the background stuff, but the song wasn't in there.
So it's possible some of this stuff might be cut out.
Very true, and didn't somebody else hack USA Mix and actually found that there's backgrounds in USA Mix for Butterfly, Bad Girls, and mostly the stuff that they cut out of Best Hits, although I gotta say...
The one that was really interesting was Bad Girls because they actually found an image of the background without the gun.
And Bad Girls wasn't in Best Hits either.
They also, using a game shark, were able to have it pull up open spots for songs.
Yeah.
Well, here's my theory on why there's so many songs listed on this thing.
Now, especially Let Them Move.
Now, this is what made me wonder about this.
Because they guaranteed that Let Them Move would not be in this new mix.
Now, before they were talking about appending this with Konomics, and if you notice, on the list, which we haven't really kind of revealed the list yet, but, you know, if you've seen it on the sites, it has pretty much, I haven't confirmed this by actually going down the list with Konomics and DDR Max USA, but they're almost identical as far as the old stuff that they have.
So, my guess would be that you can actually append Konomics with Max USA.
Now, I don't know if it will allow stuff to be playable, but that would probably be why they have the short samples on there for that.
We're going to find the list, but we're not going to really read the whole list for you guys, because obviously there's still some tricks to it.
It's not the final list.
Basically, we're not going to know until either A, Konami tells us, B, a respectable, reputable gaming site lets us know the information, or C, we have the hot little game in our hands.
So we'll read off.
What I do want to read off on that list is the new stuff, the new songs that they've discovered, because I'm guessing...
That's probably going to be the most accurate.
Why would they have information for new songs if they're not going to be in there after all?
But the old stuff, I'm guessing, is not accurate.
Things like Ghosts, I have a very hard time believing Ghosts is going to actually be in Max USA.
I could be wrong.
I would love it if Ghosts made it in Max USA.
That's one of my very favorite DDR songs of all time, but I'm thinking it might be some kind of copy over for Max for Japanese.
Who knows?
That's the...
Stoke Out Kicks sent me the hacked text file, but again, what I'm seeing on this list, it looks like codes for every song that you see, but you see things in here listed in here.
This is that part of the text file that had all these things.
You see things that I just don't believe are going to be in Max USA, like Captain Jack Grandio makes Mr. Wonderful, but look, you see these little three-letter codes before each one.
Like FLAS for Flashdance, AFRO for Afronova I think that might have something to do with some kind of append mode or edit mode, I don't know But, who knows You know what?
No, Flashdance is not Konami, it's just not Konami original We should take the import version and see if they also have similar things We'll probably, we'll look at that later, but I do want to read these new ones that are showing up in there, because
Okay, I'll tell you what those things are.
A lot of times for writing code, instead of having to write the huge long name out every single time, they'll give it like basically another name for it or shorten it up.
So for instance, when you have like, let's see, Together and Forever, they'll shorten it down to T-O-G-E instead of having to write Together and Forever every single time.
It makes coding a lot smaller.
So that's what that is.
So, some new songs we see in here that we haven't seen in DDR yet.
We've got Jam & Marmalade, Logical Dash, Look to the Sky, True Color Mix, Overblast, which has been confirmed, Peace Out, I'm For Real, The Shining Polaris, that's one I'm looking forward to, Drop the Bomb, the System SF mix, which by the way has been sent to me by JB in the chat room, so maybe we'll play that later.
Dynamite R, the Downbird Soda Mix, Take It To The Morning Light, extended vocal version, You Leave Me Alone, Dark Black Forest, Short Trip, Nemesis, cool, Ain't It Good, the original vocal mix, M2 Step, version 1.01, 22 Dunk, 511, Abyss,
Baby, Baby, Gimme Your Love, and I Like To Move It.
Well, that's Baby, Baby, yeah, some of those, so I don't know, something's mixed together.
There's some other ones on there, too, that you didn't mention up at the top there.
Let's see here.
There's one of them that's going to be, well, Look To The Sky, True Color Mix is going to be in there.
Another one was, let's see, what the hell is that?
I don't know.
Na Ha Ha?
It's DUM-S-Naha Requiem Mix, whatever the hell that is.
Orion Civilization, is that a remix?
I don't know.
Anyways, it looks like possibly an Orion 78 remix.
Anyways, DarkBlackForce, of course, you mentioned there's a...
Let's see, you mentioned Drop the Bomb.
There's a Do It Right remix, too, that's in there.
The Stat Battle Modes.
Where the hell is that?
Keep on moving and let them move Stat Battle Modes in.
What do we got in there?
Second mix.
Let's see here.
Again, I think it's just a list of codes.
The only things I see interesting about this are the new songs.
I don't think this list shows us, it really shows us what songs are going to be in Max.
It's some kind of...
Who's in here that says, do it right, harmonize, step next.
Feel the beat Feel the beat's not listed either So we know it's missing something
So, it's got to be a work in process.
So... But it is pretty interesting and it does open up a lot of possibilities for things we might see.
Alright, cool.
What else do you want to talk about, Max?
I played the demo.
Let's talk about being a measure off, shall we?
Oh my god, what happened?
Why look to the sky and let the bee hit him a measure off?
And it's even a trick, they were too.
Rumor is that somehow an old version of the demo got put on the demo disc.
That they actually released a fix to the PlayStation Magazine people, but they put the wrong one on there.
I'll be getting it later too.
I don't know, it seems kind of...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
No, not Secret Rendezvous, what am I saying?
Oh.
Well, other than the fact that I don't like playing Secret Rendezvous.
Here's another one that I found pretty interesting, and I'm all... Damn it, I gotta say the damn name.
It's R. Okay, Dynamite R3 Down Bird Sota Mix.
Hey, I'm... Let's start going on... Either way, we're effed, because we're getting a Dynamite R remix.
Reap!
Reap!
Reap!
Reap!
Reap!
Reap!
Reap!
We might, maybe we'll get to hear it at some point, I don't know You guys want to hear the Drop the Bomb mix that I got?
I think we should go ahead and play it We're going to play it, we'll play the Drop the Bomb mix And then we're going to talk a little bit about We'll talk about 8th Style or something We're not going to go into full break, I'm just going to play this one song I've got the Drop the Bomb mix, I'm going to play it for you guys Oh, it's just the clip, I thought it was a full song Ah, shit, alright, well then We get to hear the clip, alright, here we go
That's pretty cool.
That is pretty cool.
Oh, man.
It's all going, it's going trancy.
You know what Max is going to be?
DDR Max is going to be one giant rave.
Alright, alright.
I know, I'm going to, okay.
I've been wishing, I mean, I kind of like Dynamite R3, but I've been hoping that they do a trance remix of that.
Please be a trance remix and not some goddamn awful speed mix or bass mix.
Trance remix.
That's what I want.
Dude, we need more booty music in DDR.
There wasn't enough.
I would like to see some solo bass stuff.
The booty music in... I want my baby mama.
I know.
I want to... You know, there would be trouble for that, though, because... Well, I don't know.
It's probably bubble domain by now.
Think about it.
So... Who that is?
My baby mama.
Maybe that'll be next.
Next week, every time somebody says the word booty, we'll get into playing My Baby Mama.
That'll be fun.
At least we're not screaming like they're doing on... You know, it just makes me a little bit upset about my old dead computer, the fact that I had the XA player and the XA to MP3 converter too.
I would need to get all that stuff again, and then I could make them myself.
We love you all, listeners, for giving us the stuff.
Oh, yes, Loki.
Are we going to break?
Let's break stuff.
Should I be doing my little intro to this song here?
I want to talk about 8th Style.
So we'll talk more about 8th Style for the break.
8th Style.
But let's talk about 2DX 8th Style.
We've got one new song's been revealed.
Actually, two new songs have been revealed.
And those are the super secret hidden tracks, which apparently... I don't know if this is 100%... You have to meet DJ Lisu to get them.
Yeah, you have to basically kick the crap out of Agapa and Lisu.
No.
You've got to...
Triple A, a Flashing 7 song on hard.
And then you get to play a song called Sakura.
Doesn't that make you happy?
I'll never get to play that, Donald.
Jamie.
So you get that.
And then if you can Triple A that, if you can Triple A Sakura, you get a Mr. T song called Xeno on.
Like I said, you have to be DJ Lisu.
And we're going to play those songs for you right now.
But Loki has a very interesting theory about Sakura, which is a song by Revenge.
Okay.
Now...
I found this link the other day, you know, to find this song.
I listened to it, and I was like, oh my god, this is Max Unlimited.
This song is a remix of Max Unlimited.
No one is saying it is, except for me, but it's a goddamn remix of Max Unlimited.
It has the same bassline as Max Unlimited, almost identical to Max Unlimited.
I mean, if you listen to the key sounds of it, it has the exact same bass line.
Listen to Max Enigma to get what I'm saying, because that's all he has playing in the background is the bass line.
It has the exact same bass line, plus it's actually got a spot where they could put freezes.
Now, what's interesting is, remember when they were talking about Max to the XXXM, and how they said there's going to be two freezes in it?
There's two spots in this song that could put freezes for it.
Also, another thing is there's a part where it speeds up and you'll actually hear the drum that's in the background of Max Unlimited and also the bassline too.
And at the very end of the song, there's a spot where it goes that dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, you know, that type of thing.
Right.
It's got that there.
Now, don't be thrown off by the fact that it's got that twangy shit from, you know, Cigaru and all that stuff.
That's just typical revenge blabber.
First of all, it's not twangy shit.
It's traditional...
Thanks for watching!
All this fucking internet rumor shit is really pissing me off.
So some dumbass Japanese guy over there comes up, Oh, this sounds like a good name for the next Max.
And then puts it out there.
Some idiot copies that list, and then more idiots copy that list, and then people start taking that for fact.
And then we copy it.
You hear it here first on Orange Launch.
I'm kidding.
I never said that that was a song.
That was the dumbest name ever.
Sakura, okay, I am going to put my money on this song.
This is going to be the next Max song.
DJ Kanami would like to welcome you to the internet, Loki.
When it comes to the rumors.
Sakura is a Japanese folk song with the Max bassline.
I played it for my fiance, Dan, the other night, and he even mentioned that he heard it in another game that had a level that had traditional music playing in the background.
And actually, coming to think of it, I do remember hearing it before, so that's why I'm personally a little bit iffy about that theory.
However, I wouldn't put it beyond them to make that a bonus.
Now, how much money are you putting on this, Loki?
I don't know, I didn't say anything about money.
You said you're putting your money on this, that Sakura's going to be the hidden song.
My credibility, how about that?
Your dignity?
Yes, dignity.
And here's another thing.
It's 150 beats per minute.
Oh wait, double that, and what have we got?
300!
Oh, didn't see that one coming.
I mean, come on.
Do we need any more clues that this is going to be the next Max song?
Okay, or if it's not, then they did a really shitty-ass job with creating a new song.
Hmm, let's just take the bass line from this one and throw some other stuff on top of it.
Oh, new song.
There we go.
I say let's just play it.
Okay, uh, we... First off, we did get that clip of Dynamite Ray we were talking about earlier.
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Oh, shit, I said the word, didn't I?
My bad.
My bad.
Woo!
Oh, my gosh!
This tastes like aspirin.
We got this clip of the Dynamite R song.
Now, I'm being told, though, that it's kind of messed up and kind of scratchy and it's going to mess up.
We haven't screened this yet, so we're just going to play it live on air for the first time.
It might be effed up, but it's only 15 seconds, so deal with it, okay?
Here we go.
Yeah, sounds like Naoki to me.
Double your pleasure, double your fun.
Fuck twins.
I, I don't, don't wanna, wanna give, give up, up, throw, throw up, up, rave.
It's Dynamite, Dynamite Rave Stutter Mix.
Alright, enough of that.
Yeah, minus the fact that it was double your pleasure, double your fun time, it sounded a little bit trancy, and you might be getting your wish.
It's a little fat, more like a KOG man.
No, all they need to do... It sounded like frickin' Eurobeat.
All they need to do is just slow it down, you know like when you're listening to the song in 2DX and you put it in training mode and slow it down all the way?
It sounds like a Ska song, they should do Dynamite or Ska.
I don't wanna give up...
All right, let's get to those songs from 8th style.
We're going to start this off with Sakura, and then we're going to get to the special, super special stage, Mr. T with Xenoine.
After that, we're going to completely change gears, and we're going to hear a Gak song, because Jamie demands it.
That sounds good to me.
The Gak song is, by the way, the one that made it into Guitar Freak's 8th mix.
It's Another World.
And...
Okay kids, you can send me your FUs of the week over messages in the chat room.
We'll get to those in the next bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

Yume Nara Samenai De Kono Sora No Mukou E You Can't See Another World
The roadside is full of hurtful souls.
The broken taxi, you are beautiful.
We exchange words and we cry together.
Gently embraced by the pain of love.
Thank you for watching!
Tatoe donna ni kizutsu ite mo Ani ga soba ni ita kara Dare yori wa tooku e Yume nara samenaide
Thank you for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the VOG here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
You're just going to go up the street, and you're going to make a right at the Shell Station, and you're going to... Watch out for the drop-off.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey you, you five-year-old, you give me your lunch money.
I got you!
We taking Jamie on down to Sesame Street.
No, no, no more.
No more.
He said it, he said it.
It didn't get picked up on microphone.
We can't play it.
If it didn't get picked up on microphone, we can't...
Hey, you know what I'm learning how to do though?
I'm learning how to hit the buttons right on the keyboard so I can bring up that raise thing right away.
Anyway.
Our chatroom cries every time we do that, by the way.
We love you guys.
Our chatroom just gets, you know, every time that somebody says the R word, the chatroom just gets completely out of hand.
They just all at once, they just start getting into it.
They just start, you know, yelling out in the chatroom.
They just all start crying.
They all start crying.
Oh, I said it.
Oh.
You bitch.
This is never gonna get old.
Never.
Thank you.
Next week's show for October the 13th.
Oh, lucky day there.
October the 13th show will be pre-taped.
So we're not going to be doing it live here in studio.
So don't come to the house next Sunday because we won't be here.
We're going to pre-tape.
We are going to pre-tape, I don't know where.
We're doing Scandia?
Scandia.
Thursday night, I think?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey, if you want to be a special guest, show up.
And give me a dollar!
Indeed.
and now I write to you with open eyes I put that song on repeat the other night
Okay, for people who actually read my live journal, I'm going to have to have that as my live journal song for the night.
Okay, good deal.
And we'll have to do our own little guilty pleasure set soon, some week.
We're going to have to do our DDR 2DX guilty pleasures.
Okay, right now I'm commissioning somebody.
Make me this remix.
Make me Dynamite thingy mixed with R5.
It would sound good.
Dynamite R5.
Dynamite R5.
So would that be... Yeah, okay.
Yes, Thursday is going to be all about Retro Edit Day.
I'm going to bring back all the old Fourth Mix edits that I had.
Cool.
Retro Edit Day, hell yeah.
If I could come, but I probably can't, because it's school.
Uh-oh.
No, I would totally play all the edits that are already pre-loaded onto the fourth mix machine, like the B4U edit that totally rules.
And there are some other ones, too, I forget.
Don't forget about the edits that are in my pocket.
They have the Stomp to My Beat S-Maniac stuff in there.
That's cool.
So, live on Thursday, when we tape at Scandia, I'm going to see if I can make this happen, if I can get a video camera by then.
For those of you that were listening last week, you heard us bitching and bitching and bitching about these ignorant ignoramuses at TwinGalaxies.com, who do the world record.
No more references to USL.
I'm not allowed to talk about this show on that show.
So we have to limit it.
We're going to quote a... Never mind.
Travis, you're listening.
You know you're cool.
But you're an asshole for not letting me talk about DDR on that show.
Hey, he talked about Orange Lounge yesterday.
Yeah, he made fun of it.
But that's still airtime.
That's still promo.
We're going to do that live.
So it'll be rebroadcast next Sunday.
If I can get the video camera in time, we will do that over there live.
I hope Black Lab can get over there Thursday because I know he's probably going to get the best score out of any of us that I know of that would show up.
We just need to do the traveling road show too.
We need to do one from Tapioca Express in Davis.
We'll find that.
Bulba and Orange Lounge.
We'll find that bowling alley movie theater in Auburn that has the second mix.
How would that be?
Yes, this record was shattered in a tapioca express.
That would be winner.
Think about it.
That'd be just like saying, you know, this record was shattered by a paraplegic.
I shattered this record while eating squid.
Well, the record was also said by like some total moron anyway who made up his own rules.
It's like, okay, here are the rules.
I win.
I'm still thinking we need to critique the rules and send them in and to point out each and every reason why they're wrong and why they're idiots.
Rule number seven, I can only win.
No one else can win.
Just me.
By the way, I'm cute.
He's ugly.
Chatroom is getting their panties in a bunch because we haven't done the FUs yet.
So, we're going to do the FUs right now.
So, Jamie!
I'm just going to let that little thing do the talking for you.
You know who else likes that thing?
Christy's two-year-old daughter likes that.
I just remember having a particular somebody over here humping it.
Dude, what?
Never mind.
What'd Dave do?
Dude, you are foul tonight.
You're foul.
You're gross.
Okay.
Chili, I'm telling you.
The chili in those cheese things.
Yeah.
I know.
I can smell it.
Jamie, do you have any FUs of the week?
Of course I do.
As soon as I think of them.
Well, I have my secret FU, which none of you are going to know about.
I know, I know, I know the secret FU, I know it, I know it, I'm not telling.
For anybody who wants to know what my secret FU is, you know, try to find me online.
Try.
Found you.
You on Orange Lounge every Sunday night, bitch.
I just forgot.
No, my other FDs that I have, one of them goes toward Voltage.
Damn it.
You saw me play that song.
I did.
You saw how damn close I was to that song.
Of course, in 78.
I have another one that... Dude, I said what my FDs were at the beginning of the show.
Damn it, I can't remember.
Oh yeah, my other fuck you goes toward, well, it's a kind of, sort of one.
I got a job, and I liked being unemployed.
I liked living off of my unemployment.
Hooray for welfare!
I wasn't on welfare, I was on unemployment, it's different.
You know, I'm not, you know, pooping out babies just to get another fuck, okay?
You know, locking them up in the closet, feeding them, you know...
The funny thing is, if you ever did have a kid, you would fight with them over who gets to play Nintendo.
You really would.
Fuck them, that's mine.
I fight for myself.
They want theirs, they can earn their money and fight themselves.
Hello.
Anyway, but you know, my job keeps me so busy and I have hardly any time, so I'm like this zombie during the week, and I came in the zombie today.
I found, though, I do have a happy thing.
I need happy music.
Happy Thing?
Happy Music, Happy Music, Happy Music.
No, I got Happy Music, I'm just looking for it.
Hold on, hold on, I'm looking, I'm looking.
I have the perfect song if I can find it.
I got it.
It's a happy song.
Whatever.
Anyway, my happy thing is I've discovered a wonderful drink, get a drink to make it work.
It makes me hyper.
It's called Take the Coffee.
When the coffee has been brewed and people have poured and there's about half of the container of coffee left, you pour yourself a cup and add in a pack of hot chocolate.
You add in hazelnut creamer and then some sugar.
Mix it up and add more coffee and that's instant go-go juice.
It makes you hyper for at least two hours.
Top that with penguin mints to get rid of the bad breath.
I get my work done fast.
Fair enough.
Any other FUs or BlessUs or whatever we're calling them?
Um, well, other than my secret FU, which, because I'm not going to be in as much of a bitch as I was earlier.
Um, no.
And, you know, fuck that, you know.
And fuck Twin Galaxies.
I mean, conjoined Twin Galaxies.
Okay, fair enough.
So fuck them.
Fuck them right in their nostril, because they're ass-ache good enough.
Okay, their ass ain't good enough.
So now we pass the mic on to... I'm going to, no, it's my turn.
Oh, fine.
My FU's of the week.
My own job, who has moved me to a new cube that's half the size of my old one, right in the middle of Fast Lane where everybody walks through, so I can't really exactly get on the internet.
Do you have to take phone calls?
Well, we're supposed to, but we don't have to if we don't take the call and roll it over to someone else.
F-Drama
F-Drama, my life is not passions.
I am not living in passions land.
Why do you make my life feel like passions?
Well, let's see.
As promised from last week, I said I would have an FU this week.
Oh, okay, yes, you have an FU.
Now...
As much as I'd like to learn how to program my remote control and what to do if there's static on my screen and that kind of stuff, I don't like the fact that Dish Network took away all my channels.
I returned on TV this morning and all the channels were locked out because they said that they did not receive payment from us.
However, we had already paid them.
They suck.
I have to use the Dish Network because they suck and I don't care how to program my fucking remote and what the hell it can do.
And obviously, if there was static on the screen, I wouldn't know how to get rid of it because I wouldn't be able to see this stupid broadcast about how to get rid of static.
God, I hate Dish Network.
Although that one chick that's in their commercials has a nice rack.
She has a nice rack.
Nice, nice rack.
You heard it here first.
The Chicken and the Dish Network commercial has a nice rack.
And now today.
Yay.
I only have a couple of FUs.
You get the same song because I'm lazy.
Yeah, okay.
I don't want the same song.
Alright.
My FUs go to 3DX songs that I can't pass.
Mainly, Bari, this is a shitty ass song and I hate the crap out of it.
And Love is Dreaminess in G2.
Love is Dreaminess on 7 star, or 7G and, uh, and the other two on my 7.
I can't pass them.
They are hard.
Very hard.
Okay.
Oh.
Well, we're gonna do, uh,
Now we have our request and dedication.
Too bad we don't have Casey Kasem here to do it for us.
You know, I dedicated the dead airspace on the show to Twin, but I feel kind of bad a little bit, so we're going to dedicate this one song to you.
Do you feel special?
Do you feel loved?
Good.
Thank you.
Can we get back to the FUs now?
All right.
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
I don't want to say the word.
It's a bad four-letter word, okay?
It's the four-letter R word.
What four-letter R words are there?
Rave!
They knew it was coming.
See, it's just funny because every time someone says that, Rob throws his hands up in the air.
It's not being a face, it's on a Friday night.
It's so funny.
Rob starts doing the club hoochie dance.
I mean, it's a good thing he's not standing up.
I do the I want to get some tonight dance.
Okay, we're going to go to the chat room FUs now.
Oh my god, some people just wrote some fucking novels tonight, so I'm going to be quick.
Black Lab.
Well, Black Lab's cool, so I'll let him have all the FUs he wants, because he's whoring out our station.
So, excuse me, excuse me, boys.
Can I do an FU here?
Thank you.
You want to share with the rest of the network here?
You have enough for everybody!
Okay.
But yesterday at Pat's party, which was awesome, Loki brought... He's got the massive sim, DDR, DX, or whatever, and...
One of the songs is by this one guy, and he basically layered his voice over and over, making all the different noises to songs like ZXY and V. We're going to get to those.
Yes, later.
So, wait.
I now have two microphones.
Be scared.
and Jimmy, my microphone.
He's rapping.
Back to the FUs now, please.
Thank you.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Black Lab, our buddy, our pal, says, Fuck the Yankees.
They deserve to lose.
Fuck the Twins for beating the A's, dammit.
Fuck my allergies for knocking me out on Monday, I missed two classes because of it.
Fuck the University Dining Commons for closing their dinner times at 7pm and locking the doors five minutes before 7pm.
Fuck my bike for getting a flat tire as I left my last class on Friday, thus forcing me to walk it a half an hour across campus back to my dorm.
Fuck IRCLE and my IRC client for being so goddamn hard to crack, although it did get done.
Fuck the T1 line in the dorms for being so overcrowded.
250 or so people share it.
And so slow that I can't get more than 5k a second on downloads.
Fuck the local ride aid for closing at 8pm.
I couldn't get my bike parts when I needed them.
Fuck the UC Housing Commission for not letting me bring my car up because of parking issues.
I would have been at the show tonight to give you the rest of these FUs in person if I had my car.
And number 10... Fuck raving.
Black Lab, you brought that on yourself.
I didn't get number 10 from him, unfortunately, so I don't know what happened, but that was number 11, so I guess I missed one.
I'm sure he'll send it to me.
Twins got a few.
Let's see if I can run through these here.
F...
FU Arcade owner's daughter's boyfriend bitching at me because he thinks I broke the Percussion Freaks machine we just got on Friday.
He does say thank you for Percussion Freaks 4th and PPB 1st.
Hooray for Korean knockoffs.
FU to AOLIM for cutting me off every five minutes on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings.
FU to his attitude in the channel earlier this week.
FU to stuff.
FU to OthersideIRC.net for being down this weekend.
Yeah, F champs.
F Nick Servant champs.
They've been gone all weekend.
Fuck that.
I agree.
F waiting until the beta Fate of Fury comes out because that got delayed until the 15th, I think.
F waiting until Max USA comes out.
F waiting until FU is.
Well, jeez.
He's just full of fucking fucks tonight.
Fuck waiting.
Oh, did we get number 10?
Oh, fuck yeah.
Black Lab's number 10.
SoCalKicks says he's had a pretty crappy week.
He was supposed to not be here tonight.
He was going to go out and hang with some friends, but here he is in the chat room sending his FUs.
He says, fuck you, Jason, who didn't drive me to Boomers to see Mike, who I haven't seen in over a month, and who I really, really wanted to see, and fuck you, Sky, for threatening to cut me.
There's a long story there that I'm not going to tell on the air.
But I did threaten to cut SoCalKicks earlier.
I'm going to cut him.
He's going to cut you.
Anyways, do you have any more?
Yes.
JB says, Fuck you to anyone who hates Jenny Rom.
They can all suffer massive quantities of pain.
And fuck you to himself for almost failing freshman seminar with a D. Uh-oh.
You are my friend.
23rd Magus says, Shine Get, and FU to Shingle Springs.
They stole my girlfriend.
Two words, suicide watch.
Oh, that's kind of harsh.
We're sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry.
MoreThanJay says, FU to all the people who asked to use my health baby, egg baby, as a football.
They can't abuse it.
That's my job.
Dude, they should give them Tamagotchi as their egg baby.
Because that's, you know, you should use one of those.
Do we have any more?
Yes.
DJ Konami wants to give an F you to... That's what he says.
Okay.
He can't throw up.
And Joe Mama says F you to his computer for being shitty after Microsoft made me update.
That's why you never download the Microsoft update.
Ask Microsoft for getting into Liksang's business and shutting them down.
Yeah, fuck a bunch of them.
We need more angry music.
Fuck the Xbox.
We need more angry music.
We do not need love music.
I'm sorry.
Bigger console meets better console, correct?
You know, fuck Microsoft.
Fuck the, what, RIA?
Now Jamie's going to have to buy all her stuff from BuyRite.
Oh, hell no!
Jamie does not buy from Byright, because they are stupid fucks.
I'll have you know that I bought my original DDR Max, Japanese version, the one I eventually sold off later on, but I've originally bought them, bought that from Byright, and I had no problems whatsoever.
No, no, no, this is what Byright does.
But yeah, I know, we know about the whole Tekken thing, so... Fuck Byright, fuck them right in one of their pores, because none of their other orifices are good enough.
Okay, I want it painful.
But you know what, I do have to say, I did buy my copy of Dracula X, Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known in the United States as Symphony of the Night, but I bought the Saturn version there for $23 when it was brand new, and now it goes for over $100 on eBay.
$23?
I'll buy that for a dollar.
Alright, last chat room FUs, these are the last ones, this segment's going on way too long.
23rd Magus says, uh, Shine Lose.
We're sorry, Vegas.
Here's a big hug from Jamie and I. Big hug.
MoreThanJay says, Fuck Microshaft for putting down that Linux project.
Linux.
Linux.
My bad.
You know, I still like what my friend calls them.
I call them, you know, Microshaft.
My friend calls them Microflashers.
On that note, I think... Go to dictionary.com if you don't know what it means.
On that note, I do believe we're going to take another break.
What do I want to play this break?
This break, I want to play some Vincent Demore because I think he's awesome.
So I have a new version of Flotation from his Greatest Hits Disc 1 and a big muah, muah, muah, hugs and kisses to Tal for sending this to me.
He rules.
He sent me some Vincent Damore albums this week.
And I'm going to play this.
This is a new version of Floatation.
Well, actually, it's not really new.
It's just from his album.
It's new to me.
And it's new to Orange Lounge.
This is a Floatation radio mix.
And then we'll play something else.
Maybe something from 8-Style.
How about Love is Orange?
We'll play some Love is Orange.
We'll play Love is Orange.
And play that one song that I like.
And then we'll come back.
And what are we going to do?
Are we going to do Listless?
Why not?
We're going to do a list list.
We're going to do a list list tonight.
We'll come back with a list list.
We're not telling you the topic until we come back.
So it's going to be kind of a longer break, but that's okay because we're going to play some good shit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
The sound of goodbye is louder
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
All right, we are back.
This is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 15.
We, as promised, are going to do a listless, one of our favorite segments on this show.
Why?
Because we get to make decisions.
And you just have to deal with our list.
We put it down and we say this is the best or worst ever.
Our word is law.
It is law.
Resistance is futile.
So, uh, but really the final, ultimate decision lies with you guys in the chat room.
So, get into our chat, yeah, don't fuck up, and get into our chat room right now at irc.eggheads.org, Channel Pound, Orange Lounge, and you can vote on our list.
Basically the way Listless works, we're gonna give a topic, and then I'm gonna give three songs in that topic, we're gonna give our top three, all the four guests here tonight, Jamie, and then Dave and Loki, we're all gonna give their top three answers.
Yes!
You're the host and the guest.
I'm sorry, did I put you on the... I meant the host, Jamie, and the guest.
You can't see my hand motions, that's why.
We're going to be revealing our top three, and then...
The chatroom votes.
No.
No, then there's the elimination round.
Our favorite part.
What makes this game the best?
We piss each other off.
We piss each other off by taking one off the list.
Then each one of us gets to take one off the list.
And then the finalized list, you guys vote on and we get a top three right from there.
What's the topic you ask?
Well, it's a topical topic.
What song do you best like to pick your nose to?
No, it is what... It's going along with what's being in the Bimani world right now.
What Konami original song that's not already in DDR do you want... Hold your horses.
We'll tell you the topic when we're damn ready to.
I'm telling them right now.
What Konami original that hasn't already been in DDR would you most like to see in Max 3?
What did you vote for on the site to determine what song should be in Max 3?
Konami original.
Yes, Dave.
Okay, so this is any... Are you starting this?
No, it's Konami original.
It has to be Konami original.
What does Konami original mean?
Did you already make a list without Konami?
I think.
I don't know what the difference is.
Oh my god.
We might have to take another break.
Okay, fine.
No.
Alright, fine, no breaks.
It's a song like any song in Beatmania that was by Konami, you know, Naoki or something, that hasn't already been in DDR.
I'm trying to think if they were by Konami or not.
We'll let you know.
Don't worry, Dave.
We'll let you know.
Why don't we start with Dave?
Dave, what is your number three?
Okay.
The number three choice is V. Good morning, Dave.
Is that qualified?
V, yes, V counts.
V is Taka.
That'll count.
And it's less work for Rob to type.
Yes, it's very little work for me to type.
Loki, next!
Alright, that was a very difficult decision, but I'm going to have to go with Instant Love.
Instant Love!
Oh yeah!
I didn't know that would show up.
Dude, cool.
No, it's not by Good Cool.
I believe it's by... No, I said Dude Cool.
I thought you said Good Cool.
Jamie, what's your number three choice?
Oh, any reason why?
We have to ask the reasons why.
Why Instant Love?
Because, you know, if they've got to put Let Them Move in there, at least make it a good remix of it.
Fair enough.
And Dave, your reason for V?
It's a good song.
You know, I actually have to vouch for V, because for anyone who's played Pump It Up, there basically is winter in Pump It Up, and it's freaking amazing, so I fully already know what it would be like.
So for my number three choice, I actually have to go with Release Your Mind, because, you know, I'm a tax whore.
Fair enough, Release Your Mind.
I'm typing with one hand.
Uh oh, better get that plastic cover ready Just because Tack owns, that's it?
That's your reason?
Because I'm secretly in love with Tack I guess it's not much of a secret anymore, is it?
V35
Because I fucking love that song, it's 8th style, and if you don't like it, you can suck my dick.
Alright, Dave, your number two choice.
Okay, my number two choice is Give Me a Sign.
Won't you give me some affection if you do, how much you like?
Yeah, because that song ruined it.
I promised I wouldn't sing tonight, I'm sorry.
And yeah, it would make a good song.
Rob's just our little songbird tonight.
Uh, Loki, your number two choice.
Dear Diary, today I heard someone like the song that I really didn't like.
So I'm going to go to America and, quote, suck his dick.
Anyways, now, my number two song would have to be, and you heard it during the break, VJ Army.
Ah, VJ Army.
Because there's already a DWI for it out there already, and it's an awesome song.
And it reminds me of Wild Rush because it's got a bunch of different styles of music in there, kind of all blend together.
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up.
I like it.
Thank you.
Jamie, your number two choice.
My number two choice.
It would have to be more tack.
Indigo Vision.
Indigo Vision.
Just because I want to do the freaking da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da steps, you know.
That would just be so cool.
Fair enough.
My number two choice.
And if you don't like this, I kill you.
You also heard this during the break.
Love is orange.
That would be so awesome to dance.
Better than love is dreaminess.
Hey now, watch out, that could be my number one.
You don't know.
I fucking love Love is Dreaminess.
Oh god, I hate that.
Okay, my number one.
Yes, dude.
Number one.
Konami original.
Drumroll, you hope.
I hope it qualifies for Konami.
We'll buzz you, don't worry.
Yeah, it's a wow wow 70s.
Wow Wow 70s.
Uh, yeah, Sampling Masters, I think they count.
Sampling Masters will count, I think.
Okay, now that would be cool just because the afros would be in the video.
Yeah, and it would, like, if you listen to it, it would make a really good song for the steps.
It would go along really well.
Wow Wow 70s to its own.
Loki!
Your number one Konami original ever, ever, ever, ever.
I just love this song.
I mean, ever since I heard it.
Outer Limits.
Outer Limits.
I was hoping when you said outer that you'd say outer wall, but... Jamie, your number one.
My number one.
It's a toss-up, but I'm going to have to go with Happy Hopper.
Happy Hopper.
It would just be insane to play.
And I'm requiring... Oops, I put Happer Hopper.
I'm requiring that you play that during the deliberation music, because I say so.
Okay.
My number one.
Black Lab, you're wrong.
I didn't put Summer Vacation, although that's not a bad idea.
My number one is Flotation.
Oh wait, I fucked up.
Original!
Original!
Stupid American!
Beep, beep, beep!
V!
Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Gimme A Sign, VJ Army, Indigo Vision, Love Is Orange, Wow Wow 70s, Outer Limits, Happy Hopper, and 321 Stars.
So now we get to do our favorite part, and that is the deletion round.
So, let's start with Dave.
Dave, what song...
is so sucky it needs to come off this list.
Um... I'm... Rob's gonna poop on me, but 3, 2, 1, start.
I hate you!
I hate you, die!
He gon' cut you!
I am going to cut you.
God, I'm going to cut so many people.
I'm just going to stick you.
That song rules.
One, two.
One, two, three, four.
Play Breakdown if you want to hear one, two, three, four.
We're just going to need to buy Rob a rototiller so he can run over everybody.
I hate you all.
Get out of my house.
Actually, if you want to hear one, two, three, four, you play Crash.
Anyways.
I'll get you.
I'm going to have to say, give me a sign, because R&B is so fourth mix.
So, down with this R&B stuff.
Give me a sign.
Unless it's got lesbians in the video.
It's gone.
Yes, I should have picked Summer Vacation.
Oh well.
Wah.
I hate to say it because the list is getting really hard for me to choose what to take off.
And as much as I like the song, I'd have to say take off VJ Army.
Shock, VJ Army.
I'm actually really pissed off at that song right now anyway.
What's left?
We've got all these pretty good, decent songs left.
I don't know.
This is too hard.
I can't decide.
I'm going to take off...
I'm going to be a complete asshole.
I'm sorry, I don't see this song in DDR, no matter what you say, no matter what you compare it to.
I just don't see this song in DDR.
I'm taking off V. You know, it works.
It's freaking evil in Pump It Up, though.
I like the rest of the songs there.
V is a 2DX song, it's a Keyboard Mania song, it's not a DDR song for me, so...
Wait till you see it in motion.
That's all I have to say.
You need to see someone play that on Pump It Up.
Nah, nah.
You need to see someone play it on Pump It Up.
Nah, nah.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
We'll be like, ha ha!
So here's the full list.
I'm posting it to the chat room right now, and then you can send me your votes.
Except I'm having to clear out the messages I've already gotten here.
I've got to clear these out.
Okay, here we go.
Here's your choices.
You want to read that off, Jamie?
Of course, as soon as you pull the thing up and start it.
We have Instant Love, Release Your Mind, V35, Indigo Vision, Love is Orange, Wow Wow 70s Afro, Outer Limits, and Happy Hopper.
And on a personal note, I'd just like to say that everything that I picked is still there.
You know what though?
You know what though?
Honestly, Jim, now that I'm looking at the list again, I probably should have taken off Release Your Mind, I think.
Now that I'm looking at it.
But, oh well.
Too late.
What's done is done.
I did V. So send me your votes over private message.
And you've only got a minute and a half to do it because we've got to hurry up and end this show because I've got to get out of town.
So we're going to play Happy Hopper because Jamie said so.
And we'll be right back.
So you've only got a minute and a half.
Send those votes now, now, now, now, now.
Thank you for watching!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We're back to wrap up this little train wreck we've got going.
And we're going to do that by revealing the top three winners.
And we had a pretty good tie going there for a while, but we did resolve it.
It did resolve.
We have four songs all tied to one point.
Yes.
But we had somebody change their vote, which really kind of just did it right there.
It kind of broke all the ties we had.
And now we have the final list.
This is the Konami original we most want to see in Max 3 through the voting.
WowWow70s is in third place.
Yay.
Afro.
Afro.
Afro.
In second place, Outer Limits.
Yay.
Oh, I sense a personal grudge.
You're just pissed because I took V off.
Bitch.
In first place, this is the only drumroll I have, so deal with it.
Happy Hopper wins!
Because I rule and I have good taste.
Happy Hopper is the... And you know, we're actually somewhat unsure if that's a Konami original, aren't we?
We're kind of...
We're just going to say it is I would like to play Tetris while playing Happy Hopper It wins, so Happy Hopper wins Because we said so
We said so.
So we're going to have to kind of wrap up the show here.
We're coming into the last home stretch here.
Just want to remind everybody that Sunday's show will be pre-taped.
Come on into the chat room.
Our regulars will be there and talking about the pre-taped show as it's going on.
If you live in the Sacramento or Bay Area, join us at Sacramento Scandia.
I believe that's going to be Thursday night.
But please, please check the forums on sakbamani.com for any changes.
Chat room, praise y'all?
No, praise me.
and Instant Love came in fourth.
Instant Love was the one that was also tied in there, by the way.
Somebody changed their vote from Instant Love to something else.
It was winning for a while.
Yeah, it was winning for a while and then a bunch of people changed their votes.
So, whatever.
You guys are interesting.
Sorry, DJ Konami.
Sorry.
We still love you.
DJ Konami was the only one that ended up voting for Instant Love.
Everyone else changed their votes.
Yes, the dance floor is waiting for you.
Another reminder.
I'd like to also apologize.
Thursday's rebroadcast didn't happen.
That was my fault because work got in the way and I wasn't able to queue up the replay in time.
So I apologize to those of you that were listening Thursday for the rebroadcast.
But we will do this Thursday's rebroadcast at 2 p.m.
along with our Monday broadcast at 7 p.m., our rebroadcast.
and Saturday there will be no Orange Lounge at all because Live 365 will be down.
So every Live 365 station will be off air that night.
They're moving to an underground bunker server.
Yes, they're moving to an underground bunker so that Britney Spears and all those people doing the commercials, Stevie Wonder and all them can't get to them.
Stevie Wonder can't find us.
Dude, Britney Spears is rabid.
She'll bite one of them.
and give him herpes.
Or herpes.
Also known as cold sores.
No, I don't think so.
She's going to give him little icky crawly things.
Oops, I did it again.
What can I say?
Gosh, what else?
Remember, you can get an STD by playing DDR Max.
We got to get this thing wrapped up, so some final thoughts.
Jamie, you got any final... Oh, I'm sorry, you have an ooh.
You have an ooh, Matt?
Were we going to play the stupid song?
We're going to have to bump that to next week.
Because we were talking too long about... I don't know, what were we talking too long about?
Dear Diary, I made the stupid American show last too long because my segment was just as... Yeah, we bitched about DDR Max USA for too long and all that controversy going on there.
And don't forget about Conjoined Twin Galaxies.
Uh, yeah, and while we're queuing up the end of the show here, um, some update, nothing really going on, there are the DDR, um, or the Dancing Stage Remix 2 DWIs out there, so look for them, find them, they're pretty fun to play, really easy.
Um, other than that, DDR spots still down, still waiting for them to come up, I don't know why.
I should have asked, you know, Mike Noah's in town.
I should have asked him because he was right there, but I didn't even think to ask.
I missed that site.
My bad.
So that's down.
Really the only other news that we have to wait for is what new song is going to be announced on Wednesday.
That's about it.
Pretty easy.
Okay.
Any final thoughts from you, Dave?
Kachaka owns.
And my word of the week is philosophical.
Because if you were at the party last night, you know what I mean.
and also like to announce that I'll be doing news on Team Guilo now that they're back up.
Yay!
Does that make you a member of Team Guilo or does that mean you're doing news?
I never understood how their team was.
They said they were going to give me stickers and bribe me with stickers and stuff.
Well, that's cool.
I don't know.
You've got to work in some plugs for Orange Lounge.
Hey, I've been doing that.
Okay, good boy.
Alright, we like them.
We like getting plugs.
And my final thought of the week, rave!
Rave!
Oh, yeah, this is so good.
Oh, man.
Oh, I'm so fucked up right now.
Oh, the room is spinning.
Give me a hug.
I love you guys.
I love you guys.
Oh, that guy.
I was petting.
We were just rubbing and petting.
Go hug him.
If you like guns, if you like shooting, if you like action, and if you're going to rent the movies, rent them at Tam's Video on Irving and 22nd.
What is your membership number?
I don't know.
I don't know is your membership number?
Because I don't believe you've really had the San Francisco experience until you've been abused by a Chinese person.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
