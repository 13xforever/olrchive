You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Our live talk program begins now.
Orange Lounge Radio
Thank you for watching!
Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
I hate it.
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skye.
With me as always is my lovely co-host Jamie Somers, a.k.a.
DarkSakura, but not this weekend.
Jamie has decided to sit down a bit early to head off to the big Anime Expo convention in Southern California.
But we have a substitute teacher for you tonight.
Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene.
Hello to the lovely Irene.
Thank you very much.
Or some simply call her the Rice Princess.
This is episode number two for June the 30th of 2002.
We are joined in studio once again by a whole buffet of CD-R personalities.
Say hello everybody.
Hello.
Yeah, we'll be talking to some of them more a bit later, but first a very quick break.
Any other opening thoughts for you?
Oh, great, last break, next break.
Why don't you look at some Pussycats, Anna?
Oh, um, okay.
Well then, but then you can't come up to the show.
Send your boyfriend.
Oh, um, okay.
I want to try the new Triple Taco.
Okay, I will.
Friday's a big summer.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'll find money.
Actually, I don't have money.
Do you think I'll find something, Christy James?
Okay, Christy James, on the way.
Yay!
Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break.
We'll be talking about all sorts of fun stuff this week.
Another two hours to be filled with the money.
That's amazing.
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Extreme Babani Radio.
That's us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
That is us.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the second broadcast.
What are you guys looking up over there on the computer?
Are you being pirates?
Arrgh!
Did you hear about that new pirate movie?
No, I didn't.
Arrgh!
Arrgh!
I always count on you for a funny joke.
Yeah, I'm so glad Jamie chose you this time.
Let's see it for the plate.
Jamie is supposedly joining us in the chat room right now, but she's under the name BrightSakura, so I have to admit I'm a little skeptical.
So I just asked the quiz question to make sure it's really who it is.
So we'll see if she's able to frankly identify herself.
BrightSakura.
Well, I imagine if I were Jamie right now, I'd be in a pretty peppy mood too.
Oh, I'd be like...
Thank you for watching!
Don't go down the street, but I remember some angel sanctuary.
Yes, angel sanctuary, thank you.
And it's wearing all black.
Yes, was it that hat?
I don't know.
This is how much we know about anime here.
Oh, Jamie's going to kill us when she gets back.
Okay, so anyway.
Well, I thought, uh, well, last week we were talking about this whole, uh, Solo 2000 thing.
This is about the only thing in Bomani news that's pretty big right now, because there's no new games coming out, really.
Uh, Solo 2000, the evil, evil machine that it is, getting pulled from bowling alleys and things across the nation.
No, just one so far.
Um, but it's starting to kind of cause this fear and panic amongst other people, like, oh my gosh, are they going to pull our solo machine out of place over the crappy USA Mix, or what's going to happen?
To make things worse this week...
Fox News in San Diego, Channel 6, aired a special little report, and I thought we'd air it for you here on the show, and that's how we can all respond to it live on air.
If you guys want me to pause this, you can comment, just let me know, but let's take a look at this little news story.
This is coming to us, by the way, from BomaniX.com, I'll admit I just ruthlessly stole it from them, but thanks to them providing it for the internet, so here we go.
and so on.
We just want to dance your heart out.
To Bye Bye Baby Balloon?
Oh my gosh.
Hey, hey, hey.
This looks easy.
And more importantly, this looks like everything's fine.
When you're out there and you have the music going on.
When I see this woman up there talking on the screen right now, I'm not thinking about fun.
I don't...
Who is this lady?
Her name is Pamela Cameron, and she's a mom.
Just a mom?
Just a mom.
She's probably the only white lady in San Diego.
I used to live there, I would know.
I've been living for an hour, and I didn't know that there was a corn mine, so one of my kids grew up and stopped looking at me.
There's things in the music, and it's a neat thing for kids.
It's neat.
Dance dance revolution is neat.
I thought it was pretty fun, I don't know, but it is neat.
I was really quite alarmed because you're there and there's, um... I was really quite alarmed, it was a shock.
Oh, it's a nurse and pills.
Oh, no, thank you.
Pills all over the world, and needles, and... Oh, that's my dog.
Images you just may not want your kids to be seeing.
I'll keep it with the dog for now.
Thank you.
This is a heroin-dealing nerd.
It's a man, baby, yeah.
You know what's funny?
All of them show some stuff, but then they replace it with a solo machine.
Like, they show the picture of Max at the top, and at the beginning when they're explaining it, they're showing, like, somewhere over the rainbow and bye-bye these balloons.
But then when they show them shows, it's on a solo machine, and then they go back to the Max.
Thank you for watching!
I believe this is the owner of the bowling alley.
But these images are still on some local dance machine.
I never noticed that until someone mentioned it to me.
I never know that until someone mentioned it to me.
It seems like the guy who just kind of sits there in the back of the bowling alley and just like spaces.
Hey listen, we've got too many things out there that we really need to change and I don't want the country or the families to see that.
See, there's too many things out there to change.
So, let's start with those evil dancing machines.
I know.
In images that some people say should have never been here in the first place.
So what do you guys think of that, that beautiful little report?
You are making it back into the news media again.
It's pretty cool because, you know, anything that starts controversy is obviously going to become hugely popular.
And, um, the fact is, is that they, they
Yeah, there's nothing to change.
You know?
Listen to yourself.
Hold on, we have to stop the show because Dave wants to play with this slinky that's sitting on the desk here.
So hold on a minute.
There you go, Dave.
Enjoy.
Alright, I'm sorry.
You had a lot of fun.
Yeah, and I, you know, they should put a warning on DVD that says, if you play this, you're gonna, you know, evoke the Dark Lord Satan and he's gonna come and eat your children and stuff because he's a hero.
I know, like,
Seriously, I think there are more people out there doing worse things than playing DDR, which is good for your health, and there's so many benefits to it.
I'm not going to obviously list them, because everyone knows that plays.
Well, that's actually the first time really I've seen those images that they've been referring about on the article and all that stuff, like these evil images of the nurse riding on a...
You know, why don't you monitor what your children are doing?
You know, if you don't like them playing it, don't let them play, but don't have them take it Why would you leave your kids with some guy in the bowling alley who looks like that guy who's kind of sitting in the back, muck, muck, muck all day long?
Yeah, and you know you can do worse things than the freaking DJ Ranma S
I just like to feel.
You think we're going to be seeing a lot more of these kind of new stories throughout the week?
I don't know.
Yeah.
There.
Anyway.
Yeah, so.
All those films look exactly like the ones from Dr. Mario.
You're absolutely right.
I had a point.
I don't remember that up
I think because Dr. Mario wasn't dressed provocatively, you know, wearing a cute little bikini outfit, you know, and straddling a syringe, you know.
Do you think if Dr. Mario had been like Dr. Princess Peach, it might have been a different issue?
And she was like, you know, straddling the little viruses and things like that?
Maybe, who knows?
I'm on a bikini, I'd kill myself.
That's pretty gross.
But yeah, I don't know.
That's probably just because it's a female thing that you don't see on TV every day or anything.
You know, some girl has... Well, maybe you are going to see it on TV every day.
Are you just flipping through the news stations?
No, no.
I mean, like, just women in general get really glad, you know.
Open up the newspaper and look at the laundry section, you know, and then whack off to it, too.
It's called the Almost Wild On Special Life.
I know!
Behind the Playboy Mansion, and MTV!
All of it!
Britney Spears!
I know, guys!
So, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, leave that comment you want to give on this, go ahead and join irc.apes.org, and then the channel is Orange Lounge, and hopefully within the next week we will have a little online...
and so on.
Also, comedy, it's a nurse.
It's giving props to doctors.
It's raising medical awareness.
Be your doctor.
Get your checkups right early, which I don't do.
So I'm not playing enough Solo 2000.
I haven't been to the doctor in three years.
Hello, she's like my foster.
I'm bad.
I'm so bad.
Shut up.
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back with many, many FUs of the week.
Now that Jamie's gone this week, it seems like everybody has their own FU of the week.
And also, Paul will be giving us his Drama Drama Revolution wrap-up.
So stay tuned, we'll be right back in about three minutes.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
DarkSakura.com
Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
For this June 30th.
And Brad is back in the house and he has brought Krispy Kremes with him.
Thank you, Brad.
Yay!
What flavors do we have here?
Ooh, yummy.
I want one of those American... I fell for a bite.
I should be on a diet.
Although I did take back red meat this week.
I decided...
It was pointless.
Red meat's delicious.
Yeah, red meat's too good for me to be doing it.
And you know what I noticed today?
I went to Mongolian barbecue today.
And I was only able to eat, I put beef in it because I figured as long as I'm back on red meat, let's go overboard with it.
And I was only able to eat like a third of the bowl.
Whereas if I usually get like chicken or anything else, I eat the whole damn thing.
That's what happens with girls and stuff.
Thank you for watching!
Jamie Summers is on vacation this week and next week.
She's going off to Anime Expo.
But she has a little segment she does every week.
Or at least she did it last week.
And she says she's going to be doing it every week.
So I guess we'll see what she does next.
Called Jamie's F.U.
of the Week.
And since she's not here tonight, I'm going to film my own little F.U.
here of the week.
My F.U.
of the Week.
People who can't follow the freaking token law.
I hate it.
Thanks for watching!
I think so.
Um, like this person just had no concept of a line.
It was just kind of like, oh, put your token on the machine and that means you can go next.
You know, I didn't even realize people would put all their tokens on the machine.
I'm like, okay, you can go on the machine.
Oh, then you put like four tokens on the machine.
Oh, this means I'm going to play for you.
And when they do that, I flip them off and say, well, you know, this means fuck you.
Fuck off.
I'm going to play now.
You know what I hate about the token line also is trying to explain it to parents.
Because sometimes parents just don't understand.
Okay, well.
Carameld.
Yeah, boo!
So someone had to sit the dad down and explain to him over like 15 minutes how the coin line worked.
And then they shook hands afterwards.
Did they have to like draw out a map?
What do you guys think about the coin line?
Do you think it's an effective way to keep track?
I mean, we all play DDR regularly.
We all happen to go to the same place.
We all have waited in token line while other people here are waiting in the line.
Do you think it works, or what?
Well, what other kind of methods do we have?
It works when you have, like, a few people playing.
When you've got, like, eight people waiting to play, and there's just so many people that you can't even remember, you know, which one's yours or when you're going up because there's so many on there.
I think once it gets over, like, four people, then you need to find another way.
Well, I just think that it's easy to just have a little rack on the side of the screen that they put on some video game teams.
And that's like a non-falsing game room that I wouldn't say, except for the slots one through eight, right?
You know what bugs me about that system sometimes, though, is that Stockton Golf Land, a local system, has that system, too, where they have the slots that say 1 through 8, and you put your coin up there so you remember what number you're in.
But sometimes people go up there, they take their coin out of number 1, and then they move all the other coins over one space, which I can see the point of that if all the coins didn't look the same.
The thing is that it's very confusing because you don't know what to do.
I want to buy it as a triple chocolate, so you can't touch that.
Sometimes it sucks at golfing.
Sometimes it sucks at golf.
Sometimes it sucks at golf, I know.
You'll put your coin up, you know, maybe number three.
And then you get shot six times.
Because it sucks at golfing.
And then you'll be bleeding to death on the pad.
That kind of puts a damper on it.
I think Golfland's problem is not gang, well, it is gang members, that's part of the problem, but I would say their four-year-old princesses are a much bigger problem than even at Roseville Golfland.
Stockton Golfland has some mean children.
I mean, the ones at Roseville Golfland are snotty children, but the ones at Stockton Golfland are mean.
They'll, like, step on your feet, they'll throw all the coins off the machine.
They're the type that, when you play Monopoly, you know, you're going around, and if they lose the game, they just throw everything up in the air and go, I quit.
You lose, you suck.
What was I going to say?
What about other methods other than the token life?
There's the list.
The list.
How does the list work?
You write your name.
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Does it work?
Is it good?
It depends on how many people.
It's pretty pointless if you only have, you know, a handful of people.
I remember we used to do that at Roseville Golf Land when we got the 4th Mix machine and we had a sign-up sheet going on there.
But then it just kind of stopped.
Because, you know, you can work with a group of people.
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
But when there are people that just want to go up and play, you know, they don't know what they're doing.
They don't know anything about any kind of coin line or, you know, list that they have to put their name on.
They won't think it's fair and they'll complain about it.
But I would say a sign-up sheet is easier to show somebody like, hey, we've got a system going on here than trying to explain why 10 coins are all up on the machine right now.
People don't, parents, I don't know, or people who don't play PDR in an arcade scenario, they just go,
Make your name below if you'd like to get in line to play.
Well, maybe they just shouldn't play video.
Maybe they should stay home.
Maybe they shouldn't wake up in the morning.
Amen!
They shouldn't shoot themselves.
Oh, sorry, I'm not getting all extreme.
Stupid people aren't half as stupid, so what do you expect?
Stupid people deserve to play USA Next.
Exactly, that's what usually happens.
They play USA Next.
What they should do is establish some sort of bullying system.
and so on.
I bet people can get in line.
Oh, sure.
Because, I mean, look at the VideoMax shoe upgrade.
How fast does that make its money back?
I bet it's paid for itself within the first two weeks.
Sure.
This is off a black market, I'm sure.
Hey, hey, hey.
Is it worth it?
I think a lot of it is the arcade really doesn't give a shit who goes when as long as there's constantly quarters being put in the machine.
It's being suggested in the chat room that everybody just be given their own machine.
Give us a solo machine.
We'll take all the solo machines you're taking away.
Actually, they can keep their solo machines.
I played the solo bass machine down at Lake Bowl.
Solo bass is by far the worst DR mix they ever made.
But solo 2000s, solo 2000s is a little better.
At least it has like twice as many songs.
It's got some non-stops.
You can change the difficult board panel.
Is solo bass the one that was that...
Okay, yeah, we were long ago.
It's not there anymore, though.
We have, like, a flat.
That one was not bad.
You know what the worst one for me is?
What?
I think 1.5.
But whatever.
Anything 1.5 or 4, if there is ever 1.5 or 4.
Yeah, but we haven't gotten the retro value at this point.
You know, whenever somebody plays Boom Boom Dollar, it's like, oh, you're being retro.
You're going to lose a dollar.
But if somebody's playing, if somebody's playing, I don't know, what was the solo bass song again?
I don't even know what songs are on that machine.
Paranoia, Paranoia Evolution, Superstar, Victoria, Bickle Tropical.
When somebody gets Bickle Tropical, they just go, what is that?
I don't know.
I just don't like how it's always six down.
I don't want to play four down.
I hate six down.
That's another thing.
So what's it out and what you pick?
Four down, six down, or three down.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm really morally corrupt, so I don't give a shit.
Give me the phone.
I don't, you know, I don't care.
But, yeah, hey, right, Irene, she writes syringes in her spare time.
Exactly, you know.
I own a ranch where you can write a syringe.
Yeah, um, anyway.
Anyway, yeah, so, that's kind of one of the benefits of those, is that, like, you can choose between six and four and three, right?
You can do three.
I think that three is what, up, left, and right?
And you can also use the upper left and the upper.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Down and the upper left and right.
Combined Pump It Up in DDR, and that's that.
Oh, Nine Metal, okay.
Isn't that the classic person's first post on most DDR bulletin boards, though?
It's like, shouldn't they make a Nine Metal DDR?
You think Konami's just waiting to do this, or you think it's not practical for a Nine Metal DDR, or what?
How is that not practical?
That's a lot of stuff to be watching, although, granted, if you can do 2DX, which is 8 things you have to watch, or Keyboard Mania, which is what, like 26, 52 if you're playing doubles, things you have to watch.
You only have 2 feet, and not 10 feet.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It'd be worth a try.
It'd be fun, but I don't think it's something they can actually run.
That's why Technomotion is just taken off, because it's super fun.
Yeah, that's the Korean one.
Four panel, five panel, or eight panel, unfortunately.
There's no nine panel in my mouth.
But yeah, it's not like everybody, hey, everybody's doing Technomotion.
Here's my Technomotion.
If you can't see, I'm sticking my finger in my mouth.
So back to the coin line, you guys think it's effective for now?
You don't know any better alternatives?
How can we better educate everybody on the coin line?
I bet there might be people listening to this show right now.
Very practical, thank you.
Oh, you mean like, tell them how can you...
It's like, uh-uh, they don't care.
They don't care.
They just want to give them their money.
Well, you know, one can't say...
Well, you know, there's a nerd fucking a syringe on here.
Do you really want your kid to play?
No, I'll play for him.
Well, actually, you know, I think that, golf fans especially, do they really want those angry people either yelling at the players or yelling at them?
They just say, oh, fuck the players, let them yell at them.
So, hey, good point.
I think there's a little more to that, because if people are yelling at the players, the players are obviously, you know,
It doesn't matter.
They're always going to get complaints.
It doesn't matter.
It's just a matter of who's going to complain.
So, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
Yeah, I mean, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
From my experience, either they won't do it or they'll take a long time to do it.
So, I don't know.
But, I mean, I think this is where stuff has been done.
But, I don't know.
As far as the whole coin line, it's more of an implied thing that
you know, set rules that anyone has to follow according to mine you know, they can just say fuck off, I'm gonna play right now
I don't know about those people who just jump off coins and leave.
Now that's something else that bothers me that I see, and this happens at the really, really crowded places.
Say, an arcade in the Bay Area is the very first place to be a brand new machine.
Fifty coins up on the damn machine.
You have no idea who's going when.
Somebody will just put their coin up there, they'll leave, they'll go play some better games for an hour or whatever, then they'll come back and go, oh, by the way, it's my turn.
I don't know.
Do you think that if somebody puts a coin up, they should be obligated to wait there until it's their turn?
It's like they're paying their dues, they should wait there to go?
I don't want to play it that badly.
Not necessarily.
I always end up leaving coins on the machine, and I'll just say, okay, there's two people in front of me, that's enough time to play one game fair, fair, and come back and watch.
You know, I kind of estimate how much, you know, how many people are going to be in front of me, and then I'll go back.
What I use when I put my coin up, go play something else, come back, there's no coins on the machine.
What do y'all do?
and that will be his pocket.
Like, if there's ten coins up on the machine, like three or four weeks ago, and I was exalting all these people on the boards, the Sack of Money boards, we're talking about, God, I hate how people just put their coins up and then leave and come back after an hour.
They go, oh, it's my turn, because even though they've turned ass about five times.
So what I do is I put my coin up, count how many are before, and as soon as that person's done playing, I yell out through the whole arcade, I'm next in five people!
No one takes my turn.
And then so everyone knows just like when my turn is.
And it's worked every time.
That's why, that's kind of similar to what I try to do when I get in the coin mine.
If I put my coin up, I go, okay, who is the last person to put their coin up?
I'm going after that person, the hell with the rescue.
Although, I almost got killed by a little kid, a little, I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me.
It's fucking awful.
And when I, I got up there and said, I'm playing.
Because this person, but they're joking that she starts on a, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you for watching!
Have you guys heard of any other methods of keeping track in the coin line besides, or I'm sorry, keeping track of when you're trying to exploit the money besides coin lines, finance sheets?
Brad has a smart ass comment.
I know I punch you in the face.
Thank you.
Thank you, Brad.
How about maturity?
How about some maturity?
I think that's really the thing that's important here because if somebody else is trying, if, you know, before you're asking, you can say, you know, I know when my turn is.
If somebody's wrong, I'm not going to apologize.
and so on.
Yes, and that's where our emotions start to crash.
The times I try to be nice, that's exactly what's happened.
And then it's like, okay, why did I bother?
Why should I be nice?
That's my education by gunpoint.
So what they need to do is have just like the customer service desk, that Target and that Deli and stuff, the now serving sign is take a number.
I was actually thinking that would be a great system to use in a tournament, actually, because I don't know how many tournaments you guys have been into, the PA portions.
We're going to tap and everybody's qualifying.
It's like, they'll call the next person, and the next person, Oh, that guy's playing Parapara right now.
We've got to go get him when their game's finished.
And everybody's standing around there waiting for two minutes.
That would be a good idea to use.
Use the little pull tabs things, or not necessarily the pull tabs, but have the little counter, and it's like, your number is so-and-so.
So when it's about four people before you, you better be waiting by the machine, because you're trying to qualify or you're out.
I thought that was a good way to speed up urban snack trends in the future, getting around those mistakes.
But do you think that would work in a normal arcade setting?
I don't think so.
You go through a lot of that stuff.
And then who's going to pay for that?
And I'm going to have to take five in a row, so I
Do I have to?
Oh, yeah.
So like having those little numbers at Carl's Jr.?
Well, what happens to those numbers at Carl's Jr.?
They get stolen.
How many of those A-hole hecklers, though, are going to just take numbers and go away, though?
Eh, let's just put this way.
The problem's never going to go away.
People are too tempted.
Thank you for watching!
You know Mom, unless it's our machine, we can't really establish anything.
We can try to do a lot of stuff, but you know, it's not our machine.
I know we care about it, but we can only do so much.
It's not our machine.
That's all they care about.
They don't care about you and your feelings, and they don't care about if you spend five dollars or five people.
Exactly.
It's not our machine.
We can't, you know, make any kind of fool over itself.
Shouldn't our data have to take that extra responsibility when they buy a video machine?
What, fix the goddamn thing?
Maintain the goddamn thing?
Oh, you mean work?
No, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the lines.
Uh-oh.
I think games have had this problem since Street Fighter 2 came out.
I guess the token line kind of evolved.
They are a family amusement center, correct?
So they should be doing something to manage it.
I think that falls under the line of customer service.
And as usual, most places have poor customer service.
And there's nothing you can do about it until somebody either gets killed or gets sued or gets fired.
Don't forget about it.
I mean, look at this.
People don't know how to take turns.
I mean, we learn that in kindergarten.
How sad is it when we can't take turns?
People don't understand the concept of taking turns.
That's really sad.
Why are these people working for a living?
They understand, they just don't want to do it.
You know, people fly our planes, you know, serving our government.
Running our country.
Yeah, I'm not that cool.
I don't have that great of a job.
Hey, it's just a cross-section of America.
Well, cross-section of all you people of America.
Alright, anybody else want to say anything on the coin lines, taking turns, things we should have learned in kindergarten, things on that note?
And on that note, we're going to take another break.
We'll be right back.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Warning, Orange Lounge Radio, on a music and more program, might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a sharpie pin, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
I want to turn the mic over to Mr. Paul, a.k.a.
Pauliver, to talk about Drama Drama Revolution.
Yes, that would be all of the drama that goes on on the online community, on all the different bulletin boards out there.
Paul's volunteered, I guess, every week or even help us out with this.
You know, there's a lot of stuff every weekend.
There's a lot to enter, so.
Well, every week, if there's enough material, material pending, and Paul's attendance to the show, uh, pending or whatever, Paul wants to give a wrap-up.
And we're going to call it Drama Drama Revolution.
So go for it, Paul.
Last time on Sack of Money, Antonio and Meg, and Marikano and my boy, were infuriated by a girl who turned into a giant dragon eating them both.
and Nathan McClossett playing Delta Flavor.
Then DarkSakura came in, using her mod power, killed them both, and we tried to, you know, steal some order in the whole thing, but it didn't get any greater.
And then, on New York Rim, I couldn't read anything with the golden summary, and I got
I mean, God.
Everyone's just gone.
Everyone died, I mean.
Any other words you want to wrap up for us?
Alright, we'll go on to our revolution.
Thank you very much for all your support.
Irene has a joke.
Alright, we'll cut the joke and then we'll come back.
We'll take a quick break and then come back for the top of the hour.
Or whatever.
Yeah.
You want to tell your joke?
What do you call a deer that has no eyes?
What?
No idea.
What do you call a kid that has no eyes and no legs?
What?
Still no idea.
Oh, I got loose.
All right.
Okay, go.
Okay.
Anyway, we're going to do another song, and we'll be back.
Here we go.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You're very famous in the Bomani community for something, Irene.
I don't know if you want me to bring this up on the show, but I think it's funny.
You want to tell us about it, what you're famous for in the scene?
Yeah, I think maybe you should explain it.
You want me to explain it?
Well, we had this tournament in Sacramento back in October.
We are S.C.A.T., Sacramento's Cosplay Internment.
No dirty connotations at all needed.
And you happen to be one of our judges from Resale.
Yes.
We ended up having an equal, I believe, male and female judges.
No, we had more female judges than male judges, didn't we?
I don't remember, because we had you, we had Iwana Girl, Sharks Girl, and DarkSakura.
Yeah, we had four.
Jamie was a judge.
Jamie was a judge, yes, actually.
But you were the infamous judge on Freestyle.
Yes, yes.
Because you wrote on somebody's card, I would have given it a higher score.
What was it you wrote on his card?
I believe a higher score would have been given if Mira wasn't being what I wrote.
And I gave them a score of 80.
Yes.
Which is a bad score.
Which is a B. You know, what's wrong with a B?
You know, but anyway.
But you took a lot of heat.
Well, you didn't take a lot of heat for this movie.
All of Sacramento took a heat for it, but that's okay.
And you know why I didn't take a lot of heat?
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know, so, yeah, anyway, I guess I didn't say what I didn't say.
Yes, I am, but I like this.
Like, I don't care about if people get mad.
Well, what do you want to know?
or what do you have to say to the people that are like, what the hell are you thinking is a mirror thing and why would you give it a lower score?
And of course you use mirrors.
Well, like Brad Pitt.
Fuck the police.
Well, um, I can judge however I want to.
That was one of the criteria of judging was judge however you want to and don't be biased or anything.
You know, mirror is a boring thing to me.
Everybody uses mirror and it might face them towards the audience, but I don't give a shit.
Practice it backwards, you know, and
Yes, it was all the same shit, and it was good, and I gave him a high score, 80 is a high score, you know, that's a B, like I said.
So, you know, and then he wanted to be a whining, complaining shit, you know, and I'm like, whatever, I don't care.
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I want.
Uh-uh.
Yeah, so, you know, that's all on that, I guess.
Okay, well that's how you're famous in the community, so I thought we could explain that for everybody.
Yeah, that's the only way I'm famous.
I, you know, yeah, Dave showed me this ForthMix extra challenge mode.
As long as I'm in VR, I never checked out this challenge mode thing on ForthMix.
Why?
It's from the last week.
What?
Forget it.
Sorry, I wasn't here, really.
No, but it's weird because it, like, one of them, they didn't want you to hit the same arrow twice.
They had to play 59, and you couldn't hit the same arrow twice.
It was really weird.
And the next last one they just did was, uh,
It was, have you never been to Noah?
And you had to hit 350 perfect, and it was all just running left and like, yeah, 16th notes, just all the way down.
But it was just like, it was just like left, down, left, down, left, down, and really quickly all 16th notes.
It was pretty weird, and I thought it was stupid, but anyway.
Okay, oh great.
Did you have that sound effect of a screeching train coming to a halt?
That's what I'm doing right now.
I know, I don't have the screeching train, but I do have it.
I'm going to get one of those, because I'm going to be stopping the show.
That works pretty good.
It's bringing the show to a halt like I am all the time.
You know what other great sound effects I have?
I haven't found a use for this yet, but you know what?
If Irene ever pisses you off, you can just, you know, say, Hey, Dad, what's up?
Yes.
No.
Anyway.
I will be doing the fucking... Sorry, anyway.
I'm getting away from Inside Joke City.
And I'm talking about, oh, Polyglass Krispy Kreme.
I saw that.
You see?
He picked up the whole thing.
But none of us were looking.
You little man.
He wants to say something, but he can't because he has a mouth full of those, you know, those you can't see.
He's not a fat guy.
He's a very skinny, white guy.
Yeah, I love Krispy.
Okay, anyway.
Anyway, anyway, eat him and fuck him!
Um, this is my Arunco guy.
Can you say your guy?
Yes, Rob.
I'm surprised you haven't found out by now.
Thanks for finding out about our temporary goals here at Orange Lounge.
Anyway, speaking of Orange Lounge and everything, um...
Outside of this talk show, the whole rest of the week, we have a music program.
We are all sorts of Amani music, 24-7.
We throw in some Dance Mania tracks, some other stuff and some random games like Parappa, Bust a Move.
You know, all those other games that kind of led us to playing DDR.
I don't know about you guys, but before I was playing DDR, I was playing Bust a Move, Flash, Bust a Groove, too.
So, I'll find out.
So we have some songs in from that to kind of remind you of those days.
And we have a segment called...
Not in any of the money game, but should be.
And one thing I've been hearing from some people who have been listening to the stream pretty frequently is like, you've had the same damn two songs all week long.
You had Republic at Ready to Go, which was my choice, because I thought that was a pretty cool song for guitar freaks to be a really good song.
And also it's kind of got, it's got that vibe of it used to be a 90s hit, you know, a one-hit wonder band, and they've disappeared off the face of the planet.
Republic has nowhere to be seen anymore, which is totally...
Just like every other DDR band and song I've seen.
It's just some one-hit wonder band that's not around anymore.
So I thought it would be good for DDR.
And Jamie's pick was Shannon.
Let the music play.
What songs should be in the damn game that's not already?
And my choice for this week is actually going to be an old, kind of dating myself here, Yaz with Don't Go from the 80s is going to be my pick for this week.
You know that song?
Yeah.
Oh, I know that song.
Yeah.
I'm a girl.
Anyway, yeah.
That's a good song, though.
That's a good choice.
Because, I don't know, I kind of hear it as a 2DX song.
I think that's a good choice, but it fits perfectly.
What song do you think should be in a Bomani game?
What Bomani game do you want?
Well, I chose something for 2DX or, you know, 2DX.
And I chose a song called You're Not Alone by Alice.
That's because nobody knows that song.
I know that song.
Yeah, nobody else.
Which is okay.
And, yeah, like, nobody knows the song, but it's a good song.
Sheesh.
Why do you think this song should be in the air?
Because it's a good song.
I think it fits perfectly, um, that track.
I'm not playing You're Not Alone right now, am I?
Well, I know that maybe everybody out there has heard those songs, though.
Yeah, I know.
Well, if they hear it, they'll probably understand why.
So you think all of you know Longstreet?
Yeah, I think so.
Like, everything from the girls is in TVXQ.
I think that's kind of the genre, isn't it?
Like, five items.
Cool.
Cool.
Perfect.
Okay.
What about you, Brad?
What songs?
Okay, I just played DS with the three guys last night, but the one I don't want to... You can have your Crystal Nuts more than you, but Crystal Nuts song, uh, I'll... I don't know what it is.
Name of the game, yeah.
That should be in 3DX, though.
If there was any song I would like to have in 3DX, that would be the one.
That's just perfect.
It's got, like, all the great scratching along with just some great, you know, sounds almost like a tax song or something, you know.
I don't know if you want to play that for the audience or not.
So I'm going to pull up my list.
Let's see.
Let's just save it on my computer here.
It's in the directory there.
This makes for a wonderful radio.
Anything else you want to say about the song?
Which role is it called again?
Name of the game.
Name of the game.
Anything else you want to say about it?
It's good.
Oh, and it's kind of like a slide work.
Slide work.
What song and number money do you want?
Well, actually, one is kind of a little bit different.
It's the J-Trance, as I like to call it.
You mean, what was it?
It's M Above and Beyond by Amy Hamasaki.
Yeah, nobody in the VR community has ever heard of Amy Hamasaki.
I don't care.
DJ Big M should be here at the year's end.
And above and beyond.
Above and beyond.
I can totally see this in the next year.
You know, we're very, uh, fans of the DWI festival.
Actually, I've been on it, really.
Covered most of the, uh, cover songs we've got connected to these.
Oh, naturally he did this.
It's really awesome.
I have like almost every song I've heard in a year, actually.
Cool, cool.
What about you, Paul?
What song?
Well, this is a popular J-pop song.
It's been popular a long time ago.
I think it's really going to get old.
It's really rare and nice when people find you to play.
It's called Butterfly by a little band called Smile DJ.
I just wasn't born, I guess, when I was 15.
No, I knew that.
But if I came out, you know, only a couple years ago, I knew like several years ago.
But I was going to bat.
I don't care.
Yeah.
You know what they did?
Baby got fat.
Wasn't that on the King of the Hill thing when they did the DR parody on King of the Hill?
Yeah, but hey, if there's a one-hit wonder in this world...
The only other Sir Mix-a-Lot song I remember is that Jump On It or something like that.
Am I the only one?
Yeah, but I didn't listen to Crap.
I'm sorry, in the 80s, it was all about Paul Adler.
Oh, actually, Paul Adler was like 1990, but anyway, who's coming?
Is anybody else?
Who else is out there?
Get the, get the, get the other row.
There you go.
We want to hear what you guys think is, uh, should be in the money this month, already in the money.
Who wants to go?
Why don't you go?
Go ahead.
Alright, what I think should be the new VDR song or something that's coming out this year is Baby Box's Love and Ecstasy.
And why?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The song Freaky is kind of like MC Hammer, but you can't touch it.
It is.
Super Freak?
Super Freak, yeah.
So that's Disqualified.
Dave don't give a damn about the show.
He just wants to show it.
Yeah.
We're getting a suggestion from the chat room that in 2DX would be anything but that violinist trance shit.
And I think you would be referencing Vanessa May, who is...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
I think I'm pushing the 800 song mark.
Oh, actually, you're probably about right.
Yeah, 1,000.
Well, I have 769 right now, I believe.
Are you talking about your own little collection you have on your computer?
Just basically, you're trying to compile everything.
Fan-made steps that are out there, and official ones, and stuff I'm making.
Another one that's pretty funny is called Duck Toy.
I don't know, that's by Hansenberg, it's like a rape song.
I don't know that one.
Then ERA, Big Cool Fat Mix.
That means Big ERA.
That's also a rotation on the station right now.
We decided we'd throw in some, they're kind of related to Bomani, but not really things.
So we have some remixes in there.
People kind of get sick of us now.
I'm working on it.
Yeah, you come in the file.
You come in the file?
Yeah.
Any other news in the community right now?
Emulation-wise?
Emulation-wise, the melting pot's down because Team Violet's hot down.
Actually, this is now that DDR Maniac
.NET, Holy Mayhem, Mirafor, Dance With Intensity, so you can actually use the file converter and download the program again.
It's probably all going to come up tomorrow since that's when the month is up and, you know, the bandwidth is probably gone.
Right, right.
Cool.
All right.
What do you think?
Should we take another break?
Any other songs anybody wants to add?
No, I think that'll do it for now.
Okay, come again.
You know what would be great, Mom and Dad?
You know what everybody would be saying if you started pairing to that song?
All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back with more madness here on Orange Lounge Radio.
See you later.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Extreme Babani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number two.
Here we are, back and done.
Matt wanted to get in on the fun earlier.
We were doing the FU of the week, kind of trying to fill in for Jamie's absence this week.
She's off to Anime Expo.
She wasn't able to do it FU of the week, so we had one for her.
And Matt also wanted to get in, and he had a little bit of a wrap, as you must have seen.
Yeah, so my rant would be for those people that like to cut through the machine, namely Peripera and Dior.
Peripera, I always find people walking too close to me and end up backhanding them and that kind of thing.
Really, I don't care because if they're dumb enough to walk that close, I really don't care about hitting them.
But then you get those people who get pissed off when a game hits because they're walking too close.
And I actually tested this today.
I stood in the middle of a Peripera machine and stuck my arm out, and it actually, it's inside the machine, so these people are walking way too close to the machine.
and I hate them.
I hope they all die.
That pisses me off, too, when people do that on DVR.
And little kids do this all the time.
You'll be up there dancing, doing your thing, and then suddenly, you know how there's that little space between where the machine is and where the pad is?
A little kid decides that's the fastest way for them to go.
They'll run right between you and the machine when you're trying to play.
Like when you're in the middle of an Oni course or something, they just run right through the machine.
What the hell is that?
I gotta say though, ever since bad parenting, what Dolphin did a little while ago is that they took these little wooden platforms and kind of stuck them in between the machine and the pads, which actually I think really helped that because now little kids, if they want to do that, have to take a step up.
And I think most little kids are too lazy to do that, so they go around now.
So I guess problem solved in some aspects.
But now ParaPara seems like it needs some kind of moat built around it or something.
Seriously, I kept hitting this guy in the head.
You were hitting a guy in the head?
Well, okay.
He was bending over.
Was he four feet tall?
No, he was bending over and helping an old kid with a sumo machine.
And, you know, I hit him in the head.
I hit another guy, you know, in the ass because he was, you know... Hey!
Hey!
Thank you for watching!
Any suggestions on how a golf player can fix this problem?
Yeah.
Oh, well, there's no way to fix this problem.
Just, you know, people need to watch where they're walking.
I don't walk in front.
I mean, especially like mo-caps.
I mean, like walking in front of someone and playing mo-cap boxing.
I mean, if you don't want to get hit, don't walk in front of people.
Mass Execution.
I love all these practical solutions you guys come up with.
Rearrange the game.
You can't stay on the heat.
Get out of the kitchen soon.
I agree with you.
They should definitely rearrange the game.
Since MoCap's not working, why not put that there instead?
Put Parapara where MoCap was.
That's a good idea, but the thing about why they put Parapara and DDR and stuff in the area that they do is because there's arching, and they cannot fit through the arching.
I mean, I don't know why they don't just...
That's too high tech.
They have to pay an expert to do that.
I don't know.
This is what they're saying.
But that's why they keep them in that central area when you first walk in.
Nobody cuts through sumo.
You know, it's because I beg to differ.
I think sumo is a very gay game.
I mean, you've got this big red ball that people are sitting in.
It's somewhat fashionable.
Fashionable?
Fashionable.
Uh-huh.
Where is Shibamon?
Anyway, he should be on this show.
Shit, I just don't like myself.
I hope not.
Oh, okay, good.
Shibamon, where are you?
You know what's even worse than that?
What?
Kids that mock you when you're playing.
I have one of the worst, Brad.
Get Brad in here for a minute.
I want him to tell a story.
We have the worst hecklers this week at Golfland.
I want Brad to tell a story.
Brad, tell our listening audience about the hecklers at Golfland this week.
They were especially awful.
Well, there was these cavemen and they were like bouncing up and down behind me saying that they were, you know,
I was mad because I was losing, but I was asking the only love without getting any, you know, good sort of thing.
And so I said, you're even better than I was.
I don't know.
But I didn't say anything to him.
I just, well, I just stuck my finger on him and it happened to be the middle finger.
And he said, oh, you can't put me off.
So I did it again.
And he said, hey, if you do it again, I'm going to kick your ass.
So I did it again.
And I said, fuck off.
I'm going to
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
They didn't do anything, but I guess, you know, you get four or five guys together and they think, oh, it's only one guy, so, you know, what is it, Strength and Numbers or something like that?
Yeah, that really works, right.
Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
Yeah.
Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
No, it sure does.
What?
Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
I have never been officially a droid addict, really.
Well, actually, I think the problem has kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.
I mean, I remember we used to be playing on USA Mix and stuff back when we had 4th, you know, and just swapping off of that.
And I actually had, you know, little kids trying to pick fights with me.
For no reason.
I was just playing the game, and they just come up and try to pick a fight with me.
You know, I just kicked their ass.
I'm like...
Where the hell did you come from?
And then, um, Hulk Knight, you know, Eric was there, and then, uh, he's like, so, what the hell?
What's a kid?
And he's like, no, you and I are crackheads.
And he's like, dude, Matt, where'd you find this guy?
He's just hilarious.
And the Hulk Knight kind of does look like a crackhead, but that's okay.
Yeah, but... But he's a great guy.
He is, he is.
Yeah, I mean, he only teased because we love him.
Exactly.
But, you know, I haven't had any kids in such a fight with me, especially little kids.
That happens all the time.
I mean, seriously.
Hey Brad, you look like a Kraken.
Remember that one kid?
You know that one, dude?
Remember he was making fun of any of his youth and someone else?
And then... Yeah, and then he goes and plays on DDR and we come up behind him and we tease the crap out of him.
I mean, we are mature.
And then we all kind of go away because we found something more interesting to play for five minutes.
I mean, when I say we all, that means there was like about five, six, seven of us.
And then this little kid, when we're not looking, gets on the machine and starts playing, as if we're not going to notice.
And I remember, we all got up there and started cheering him on, going, yeah, go, da, da, da.
And then he failed his song, and he ran to the bathroom and cried.
Yeah, and we were like, you're so awesome, I want your kids.
I think the worst thing that ever happened, or not really the worst, but actually probably the most recent, was playing the machine.
I had this guy, they're just like standing there kind of mocking me, jump up right in front of me with the camera, flash, and then jump off the machine.
And he did that twice.
I had people like...
I have this black guy, you know, he's standing there, and he's like, who's there, what's going on?
Then him and his friend show up, and it's like, pretending to freak me, and she's like, what the hell are you guys doing?
They're just acting like total assholes.
Why didn't you jump on that shit, man?
They're like, oh, freak dances, oh, oh yeah.
I hope they just want my side, man.
Yeah, you know, that's a reference to a movie, I'm not really just, yeah, okay.
You know, that reminds me of an earlier incident I had online with people, which kind of took me away from people, like, what are you going to do with that?
I was playing Grameen one day, and the guy said, Jamie got kicked out of golf class.
He was like, they're coming up, lost my Grameen.
I was like, that one must be quarter black.
I'm convinced now.
I was playing some Grameen songs.
That was exciting, but I didn't think it was going to be that bad.
Wait, they were saying you were a quarter black, or they were saying Jamie was a quarter black?
Are you a quarter black?
Well, I like it, you know.
Okay, yeah.
Anyway, let's change the topic now.
Well, I got physically removed by somebody from the VR machine.
How did you get physically removed?
No, a guy jumped up onto the stage and grabbed me and threw me off the machine.
I was physically assaulted on the machine.
Were you raped on the VR machine?
No, guys, like I said, straight to numbers.
I got ten guys together and I'm like, hey, look, there's one person playing an arcade game.
Let's make fun of him.
And he said, you can't.
Let's gangbang him.
Yeah.
So I failed my course.
That's why I pissed on him.
I didn't care that he was being a jerk.
I was just like,
I failed the course, I was away from the dollar, so I pushed him and he said, oh no, you're going to hit me, but his friend stopped him, I guess, and I was like, yeah, you don't want to start shitting with me because I'm white and skinny.
Yeah, I could hit you with my lanky skills, really.
Matt has brought with him to the show.
This week, a lovely VCD.
You explain what the hell this is, Max.
I really don't.
I still haven't figured it out.
I watched 10 minutes before the show and I still haven't figured it out.
Actually, what this is, it's a VCD, actually two VCDs.
We've got one that's called Parapara Dance and one that's Parapara Stadium.
Everyone knows what Parapara Stadium is.
It's just Parapara all-stars doing the routines for different parasols.
So you can learn them.
But the first CD, Peripera Dance, is a bunch of different clips from this one variety show that's actually on TV.
It's starring Takura Kimura.
And this guy, that's it.
Yes, I believe it's Takuya Kimura.
Just thank you.
Alright, that's it.
Anyways, what this guy is, is he's a singer and actor from Japan who in the 90s started doing hers on TV and actually kind of made it popular again.
And so we've got a clip, I mean, because this guy, he plays a character called Bucky Camara.
Now, we have to remember that this is radio, and the audience can't see what we're playing.
Now, the people in here can see what we're playing, because it's on a giant monitor here, but we kind of have to do the best we can to make this radio-friendly segment, so you might have to explain what's going on.
Okay, well, basically, the scene starts off, it's kind of...
So what I'm going to do is, I'm sorry if they have a class that actually shows these people with almost looks like springs on their arms that actually, you know, kind of like those muscle springs to strengthen your arms.
Kind of like buns of steel, that sort of thing?
Yeah, that type of thing.
Anyways, so let's get started off with them and doing this, and I'll kind of narrate this as it's going along.
So here we go.
And you have to spin up.
And we need the volume.
Okay, so basically things getting faster and faster.
We're kind of speeding up the film here in a ridiculous fashion.
This is goofy.
Yeah, it's a Japanese goofy style here.
And the springs are breaking dramatically.
Because, yeah, it's a humus tour.
And now enters Buffy.
Whose theme song is Maya Fierce?
and they're showing us a statue of him, a bust of him and out he comes with the Iron Paragunther with the lights everywhere and stuff and a poopy bottle and now he's going to do a passport turn the beer which I must add, I like this car, I think it's awesome
Here he goes.
Oh yeah.
Michael Korsnick.
This is one of those guys.
Definitely.
He's my idol.
Yeah, how come the English school in New York has an idol like an ass?
I mean, all the schools in the United States.
No, no, I think, I figured it out.
It was cool because he has 50 hot Asian women behind him.
That's why.
Anyways, this is pretty much the normal part of the video, him doing this routine, which is... He's just got a lot of style.
He just is very cool.
And now it gets ridiculous.
It's showing him perfecting his technique, his end pose, as you might say.
Now he's getting ridiculous.
It's a Kofu Haramata movie.
He's poking past lasers.
He's got people fanning him down, his arms and stuff.
He looks like Gatsby right there.
And now he's gonna do the traditional kung fu thing with the candle and moving fast.
And blow his candle out.
And he's still dancing.
In the classroom, I might add, with all the disco lights everywhere, out of nowhere.
Now everyone's stopping, he's ripping off his shirt, and under his shirt is that spring.
He's putting the metal things on there.
And they're taking the springs off.
They're taking them off.
And now he summons for his assistant, some hot bathing shirts.
And here he goes.
Oh, and his final move, and the dress comes off.
Everyone cheered because it's so stupid.
All the Asian women cheered because they got to see a panty shot right there.
Marilyn Monroe.
I know the Marilyn Monroe.
All right.
Let's do one more question.
Any more of this crap?
Yeah, worst radio ever, guys.
Worst radio ever.
Okay.
That was great.
We're being experimental, damn it.
So let's give it one more chance.
I really wish I could all see this because this is actually...
Maybe we can put some still images up on the site later.
Yeah, you need to rip some of this.
I'm going to put this on the site.
Oh, definitely.
You know, I may want to rip.
Okay, and now we're going to have the theme's inside of a club, and there's some J-pop singer who I have no idea who it is.
And the theme appears to be some sort of cover of EQ Up.
And he comes out doing his Night of Fire bit.
And there's Persistence raging out of stage now at Phantom of the Opera.
Or Phantom of the Parapara.
Phantom of the Para, guys?
And he walks through microphones right here for no apparent reason, I don't know why.
And then he walks away.
Then he can, uh... He's doing a pose and the camera swings.
And he's doing another turn.
Okay, one more here.
Okay, we can only do one more.
If I can cover V2 up, I think.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And there's old people playing croquet, and there's a guy in a coat that you can't see his face.
And that's his trademark whistle there.
Oh, get out of here, Robin!
I guess in the dark.
It's dark!
And all of a sudden, the outside becomes... Is this the life in the yard?
And he's doing another fire again.
And he's noticing people aren't dancing, and they're staring at him like a nut.
And the old guy recognizes him as Bucky.
And so he's going to put in a tape that the old people can dance to.
Oh, I see, because old people don't listen to CDs, they use tapes.
Night of Fire Upward Version Nothing is more funny than watching a bunch of old people terror in a facility.
This is what you're going to look like in 60 years.
This is Milpita's stall plan in 60 years.
Alright, everybody give a big hand for Madness.
We're getting a comment saying, this is sad.
Alright, that about sums it up.
On that note, we're going to go ahead and take one more quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap it all up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Blow my whistle, baby
We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.
We think we figured it out.
Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, just about at the end of our second show.
I am your host, Rob Roberts, or you might know me as Skye.
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, is not here this week because she's at Anime Expo.
So filling in is the lovely Irene the Rice Princess.
And of course, we also have in studio many, many guests.
And I'd like to thank all you guys for coming this week, as she did last week.
We've got Matt, we've got Paul, we've got Brad, we've got Bradley, who doesn't say anything, but he gives moral support.
And in the other room, we've got Glenn and Dave.
Dave's coming in the room right now.
I guess I thought I'd ask you guys at the end of the show, but I really should have asked you guys at the beginning of the show.
How was your week?
Anything exciting going this week?
Anything you want to talk about openly on the radio?
I work all day.
Parking every day.
Parking?
Freaking Brazil.
And Sunsplash Parking.
Their whole parking lot was full.
Parking across the street was full.
If you wanted to get to the Sunsplash, you either drive around the parking lot for half an hour like I did, or you go park across the street at the hotel, which probably also was full.
Wow.
What was something going on there today?
Yeah, it's called the water park.
There's a drawback with having a big, nice park like us.
Since we have a water park, it's always busy.
You can't find parking space during the summertime.
And there's going to be tons of people in their swimsuits, dripping water all over the pads.
And a ton of hot chicks in bikinis.
I don't go there to look at hot chicks.
I go there to play.
I don't need to go.
Shaz, you do it too.
Shaz, you do it too.
Shaz, you do it too.
Shaz, you do it too.
I'm worried nobody listens to the show.
It's okay.
I know.
I get arrested.
Look, right there.
Zero listeners.
Let me know.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The police are listening.
Let me know.
I had time off work this week, thank God, and I basically spent my time sitting at home playing old school video games, because I discovered that my greatest use for the Dreamcast is to burn old Nintendo games and just play them on the Dreamcast.
Why would you burn them?
Why would you give them to me?
Not like that, like burn on the ceiling.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Shut up.
My dog ate Kona Mix.
and I discovered, I rediscovered my love for the Guardian Legend, the old 8-bit Nintendo game which was half shooter, half Legend of Zelda.
I love that game so much.
If they ever made a sequel to the Guardian Legend, I think I'd quit DDR.
If I'd be too busy playing the Guardian Legend, I'd quit DDR.
What old school video game would have to come back for you guys to quit DDR, you think?
For me?
Attic.
What are some good old school games that need to come back?
Oh, you know what's coming up, didn't we?
I don't know.
Oh, yeah, we're making it.
Rygar.
We're making Rygar.
Are we?
Yeah.
Ninja Gaiden.
Shinobi.
And, of course, we know it's coming at some point.
Mario Kart.
Oh, yeah.
Are they going to make a Mario Kart on GameCube?
Oh, I don't know.
They'll make it for everything that matters.
And that's always the game that gets me to buy the system.
So once they've made it, they've sold themselves another game too.
Alright, I'm talking about old school video games, not the game theory stuff.
Masha, I want Duck Hunt 2.
Huh?
Duck Hunt 2.
Duck Hunt 2.
Yeah.
Where you can finally shoot that fucking dog.
Yeah, exactly.
The dog's revenge.
What about Goonies 3?
No, they're making a Goonies 2 movie.
It's actually going to be with the kids.
There was a Goonies 2 video game, remember?
Yeah, it's back.
The Goonies 2 was the video game.
Yeah, it's back.
What about Goonies 3?
I mean, any of them.
With another Cyndi Lauper remix.
Wouldn't that work?
And they did it like Symphony of the Night, you know, it's all... All gothic, and then you get Shonic, and then Shonic, like, he had a little, like, circle trail following behind him, but it's really just his sense of smell.
Baby, you've got Rocky Road!
Rocky Road!
Oh, for once.
Well, you know, they're actually, I know they have it in Japan and stuff, but they're actually making a lot of action.
And then on the next episode, how about Quirks the video game?
Do they have that yet?
No, but that'd be awesome.
That would be awesome, but what would you do in it?
You'd just shoot customers.
It's a quiz.
It's a quiz.
Are you supposed to be here today?
Of course not.
I don't know.
Who says we have to spend time with money for two hours?
Come on.
Yeah.
You know, I would crush it, wouldn't I?
That's a cool game.
That is a freaking awesome game.
They need to make a good sequel to Blaster Master.
That's true.
I'm just ignoring all those other copies of Blaster Master that they've done since.
The first one still exists.
The first one is awesome.
You know what?
Blaster Master.
Blaster Master.
Blaster Master.
Your HP tastes so good.
Ooh, by X-Commando, another by X-Commando, that'd be pretty cool.
I mean, they have one in Game Boy, but, yeah, he's already on PS2, that'd be cool, or some other, you know, system.
Yeah, there he goes!
The guy has legs!
I know!
You know what I mean?
With jumping abilities, someone's like, uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Well, on that note, I think it's about time to close out the show.
But I thought I would also bring up, before the show's over, I'm going to get to pay five more dollars a month to keep this station running because of the carp royalty, well, they're not carp, but the royalty rates that were passed this week by, I don't know, some judge.
And I'm horribly misinformed on what's going on.
But basically, long story short of it, Internet Radio is now going to have to pay seven cents
for every thousand listeners that are listening to the song.
Now, not that this station should have much of a problem because we don't have any listeners, but unfortunately, our host, Live365, decided to do a blanket fee for everybody.
Everybody's going to have to pay $5, which, you know, is a cool way to do it.
Live365 has been pretty good at keeping up the station going on and everything.
I can't really knock them because they do provide a really good service because this thing would never be able to run off shoutchats.
But if you do think this sucks, I would visit SaveInternetRadio.org and have a read there on what's going on with Internet Radio because if over-the-air radio stations aren't having to pay these kind of fees, why are we?
I guess there's quite a lot going on.
Save Internet Radio, guys.
So SaveInternetRadio.org.
I'll leave you on that note.
Let my PPL go.
Well, we could pay for last show and this show combined.
Anyway, while we figure that out, do listen in next week.
Jamie's got the week off again, but we'll have Irene or somebody will be, yeah, two or one.
I'll be here.
We're not supposed to disclose the amount of listeners.
We don't want that.
Is everybody else going to be here next week?
Thank you for listening, everybody.
Have a good night.
