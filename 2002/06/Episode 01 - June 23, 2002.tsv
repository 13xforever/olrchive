156376	157417	Oh yes, quite often.
157477	157937	All righty then.
158377	162120	For the very first break song, I'm going to play something for the Fantasia album.
162500	164322	This is Vanessa May with Destiny.
165002	166483	And it's Vanessa May at Freaky Rocks.
166503	167224	Don't it, Jamie?
167264	168064	Vanessa May Owens.
168305	169025	Alright, here we go.
169045	171927	This is my destiny.
200041	202103	Thank you for watching!
293289	294277	Thanks for watching!
343962	345132	I met you when you were sleeping
460681	468931	Baby, no, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, yeah, baby Bye-bye, baby balloon Bye-bye, baby balloon
482725	484486	Bitch, get a new song!
485127	487548	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio
513337	514178	It was Brad's idea.
514418	515138	He just claimed it.
515239	516179	It was all Brad's idea.
516339	516920	It's your fault.
517880	520923	So if you want to blame somebody for this talk show train wreck, just blame Brad.
521063	521483	How's that sound?
522404	528988	Anyway, I think the idea came to us, what, probably back in January or February?
529008	534192	When was the first time you guessed it on the other show, Under Sedation Live, that we participate in?
534452	536694	That was in January or so, wasn't it?
536714	537455	I know it was this year.
537635	539256	I think it was probably back in January.
539336	542138	It was after I got my new computer, so that had to have been in January.
542389	558678	Yeah, when Jamie was on the first Under Sedation Live that she was on, which is another show that I co-host, you can visit that website at http://undersedationlive.org or it's actually one of our friends on the playlist, or on the Live 365 site.
558698	564622	So if you go to Live 365 and take a look at our fellow broadcasters, we have the Under Sedation Live listed there.
564642	566763	And that's the show that I co-host on Saturday night.
567123	570545	And I'd also like to say, if Travis happens to be out there listening tonight,
571125	574428	I really appreciate all the help, and this drink's for you.
574809	577491	There you go.
577591	579673	That relates to last night's show, don't worry about it.
582376	590743	So, probably back when Jamie hosted this show in January, we thought, you know, we ought to do a Bomani Talk thing for Bomani.
591144	595728	Just not, you know, because Under Station Live kind of...
596989	599950	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
625802	626923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
644757	645637	Two game rooms going.
645677	646578	We've got one in the back.
646798	655880	And if you look at the webcam on our website, http://orangelounge.sky.cx, you can see on the webcam there's some people.
655900	657261	I think they're playing Max in there right now.
657301	657621	I don't know.
657961	658461	I think so.
658481	658941	In the other room.
658961	663703	And then in here we've got Keys Pounding, which you can probably hear because we've got Brad in here playing some 2DX.
664563	666384	Yell something to the people out at home, Brad.
671014	672375	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
701010	701731	You've got to talk into the mic.
703331	703812	Oh, okay.
703972	705813	Sorry.
706593	714797	Speaking of firsts, since it is the first show, we are kind of expecting that there's going to be a lot of issues tonight, so please bear with us throughout all the technical difficulties and everything else going on.
714957	716518	We have the communal microphone over here.
716538	724962	We have the communal microphone that everybody's going to have to talk into, which Irene has pretty much parked herself near, so I think we'll know who we'll be hearing from most of the night over there.
726202	733704	First experiences with Bimani, because it's kind of something you see once, you play it once, and then you're pretty much stuck with it for the rest of your life.
733984	736245	Especially if you're listening to this program.
736265	745488	If you've actually gone out of your way to tune into a Bimani-focused radio program, you're obviously a very ill person who's come down with a Bimani flu.
745748	747008	Or you've succumbed to my threats.
749829	751229	No, no, no, they're not dorks.
752129	752390	I am.
752590	752810	Are you?
753190	753290	No.
755623	759385	So, Jamie, what was your very first Bomani experience?
759405	767830	What was the first time you... I know you, out of probably most people here, I'm not sure because we haven't really compared everybody's notes yet, but out of most people here, you were probably the very first person to play DDR and all that.
767890	771492	To go way back in time, let's go to 1999.
772953	778797	Around February or March, I first heard of Beatmania and thought, oh, that looks kind of dorky.
779317	784400	And I actually had Beatmania 98 on my computer, so that was my ever first Beatmania experience.
784620	786662	Oh yeah, how many of us started with BM98?
786682	787763	Raise your hand.
788543	789364	That'd be me and Brad.
789864	792807	Anyway, I went to Anime Expo.
792847	795449	I had heard of Dance Dance Revolution and said, that game looks stupid.
795789	796790	I'm going to go play Best to Move.
797470	800873	So I was in a Best to Move 2 tournament at AX1999.
801653	805136	Spent like an hour owning everybody before I got a faulty controller.
806077	811221	And so I went over and was looking at these people because I heard Shake Your Booty playing.
811781	813303	And it was DDR Second Mix.
814083	815464	So that was my first DDR.
815504	817045	I didn't actually really play it.
817145	819706	And then I hit like 2000.
820247	824769	And I saw the first one on PlayStation and got hooked then.
824829	825890	I borrowed my friend's game.
826330	827371	Couldn't pass Butterfly.
828172	832114	I was asleep one night, woke up the next morning, and just, like, passed Butterfly at random.
832294	835256	So, I didn't see my first DVR machine until AX2000.
835676	836497	It was the third mix.
837337	844441	It was $2 a game, and, well, I dished out $2 a game, slept in the room, and there went my addiction.
845762	848183	And I started off with the Dreamcast, and nobody can say anything.
848244	848824	Sega owns.
850140	850701	Not anymore.
850721	852022	Don't bite me.
854004	856727	Hey, hey, Sink is making games for the GameCube.
856847	860391	Their third-party stuff is looking pretty good, so I've got to give them some credit.
861112	861953	Give them lots of credit.
862717	870579	And actually, DDR Club on the Dreamcast is much better than the PlayStation version because they had to split the PlayStation version into two CDs, and that kind of sucks.
870599	874200	But on Dreamcast, it's all in one nice, shiny little package.
875320	881962	My first DDR experience was, and funny enough, you know, the show that this is kind of spun off of is a Rocky Horror themed show.
882362	885643	I actually first discovered DDR at a Rocky Horror convention.
886023	888304	And this was, hell, I don't even know, I think it was 2000.
888344	888484	Yeah.
889404	890325	I'm getting so old.
891126	899813	I think in October of 2000, we were at a convention in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel, and they were showing the movie Friday and Saturday night.
900313	904016	But we decided, you know what, once a week's enough, so we're not going to go Friday night.
904296	908220	We're just going to go out to the arcade, and we're just going to play games, because that's what we want to do.
908640	913824	And there was one of those big dancing machines with the flashing seizure lights, and we all wanted to play it.
914485	915686	That was your first night too, wasn't it?
917332	918853	Yep.
919053	923034	Anything else you wish to add about... About DDR?
923114	924435	Do we play our first game together?
925275	928936	No, I think it was just me by myself first, because you guys were pussy.
928956	929637	I don't remember.
930117	935599	And you're like, we're white, we can't play this, let the Asian do it first, and then we'll look cool, you know, after.
935659	936079	No, I'm kidding.
936439	936759	I don't know.
937120	937400	But, um...
938260	941323	Yeah, we were at Circus Circus, and what was it, a 1.5?
942244	943946	It was the old USA Machine.
944126	944927	Oh, okay, I know.
944967	947149	I distinctly remember the song Butterfly.
947209	948370	Shut up, shut up.
948490	949371	Everybody played it.
949631	953515	I remember it was the spinning discs that you can choose from instead of the song list.
953535	954576	Yeah, I remember that much.
954756	956137	And we fucking sucked.
956157	956878	We were terrible.
957339	958239	I remember passing.
960181	962402	We passed the first song.
962442	964323	And didn't I pass Boom Boom Dollar the first time?
964823	971467	Yeah, you passed the second song and I was like sleeping by then because I failed like the first three steps.
971527	975348	I would like to take this moment to give Irene an inside joke and then the maid.
976869	977909	That's the best joke ever.
980570	981031	Shush, Brad.
981611	982831	Oh my god, this show's going to suck.
982871	983091	Anyway.
988213	997857	So after that, we came back home to Sacramento, land of nothingness, and we thought that was pretty much it, that was the only time we were going to play DDR, and then we found that Roseville Golf Land...
998697	1005560	ended up getting its own DDR machine sometime in, I think, what, December of 2000?
1005741	1009342	They picked up the Super Elite USA mix.
1009682	1023189	I remember it being toward the end of the summer, because I had been playing at Country Club Lanes, the evil place, and then I heard, hey, there's a USA machine over at Roosevelt Golf Land, went over there, and that's when I met lots of people.
1024227	1027249	I met Danielle first and through her I met Brad.
1027970	1034575	And then I met a bunch of people at Milpitas Golf Land on that first road trip to find Parapara.
1034655	1035996	With the sacramenstrals.
1036356	1037697	Yes, the sacramenstrals.
1037977	1042820	We, you know, suck so bad we bleed, I guess.
1045502	1046303	And we don't die.
1046403	1047003	Oh, dear God.
1047124	1047444	Okay.
1047664	1050366	We suck so bad we bleed.
1050786	1053427	Anyone else in the room care to share their first Bimani story?
1053447	1055308	Because we're really desperate for material right now.
1055668	1059089	Because everyone's convinced we're never going to fill a two-hour show of Bimani Talks.
1059109	1061510	We have to prove them wrong, even if we have to bullshit for just two hours.
1061550	1062630	He's got the microphone.
1062750	1063390	Everybody runs.
1063410	1064191	Loki, a.k.a.
1064251	1065411	Matt, would like to share a story.
1065711	1066091	Let's see.
1066151	1072033	My first experience with Bimani, I'd have to say it started back, I believe it was the year 2000, with...
1074614	1103097	Phantomacon, I saw someone playing 5 key Beatmania 2nd Mix and actually it was really cool, what song that hooked me was the theme for Metal Gear Solid and from there I went and bought everything for Beatmania played it a couple times and put it away and then next year comes around, 2001 and I saw them playing DDR 4th Mix which was really awesome
1103564	1104825	That game I really got into.
1105525	1111988	And so I actually got a chance to play it first time in Lake Tahoe and I found out I had no rhythm whatsoever.
1112649	1114490	In fact, I sort of looked like
1115869	1117151	Steve Martin and The Jerk
1134468	1155714	So then, you know, flash forward back to about a year ago, I come to find out after I moved from El Dorado Hills to Orangeville that Roseville's got, you know, 4th and a USA machine, and I had, during the time, picked up also my own home version of 4th and 3rd with two pads, and I'd been practicing on Pink Dinosaur and La Senorita.
1155794	1156375	Oh, Jesus.
1156915	1157255	Oh, yeah.
1158311	1158991	I remember those.
1159271	1164173	Anyways, so then I started playing at Roseville constantly.
1164513	1169235	I used to do nine hours a weekend and actually I think I still do about nine hours a week.
1170395	1171436	Excuse me to cut you off for a minute.
1171456	1173016	Brad, Brad, Brad, yeah.
1173056	1174777	That song is banned in this house.
1175057	1178338	Do not play 250 BPM in this house.
1178398	1182539	Everybody in this house has nightmares about that freaking crack baby in the video.
1185546	1186627	I'm sorry to cut you off.
1186687	1187027	Go ahead.
1187347	1187907	That's alright.
1188207	1192770	So yeah, nine hours a week for a whole year so far.
1194610	1196231	Alright, woo!
1196271	1197512	Anybody else want to share their first story?
1197752	1199032	Brad, I'd love to hear your story.
1199072	1199333	Come on.
1199653	1200353	Put the controller down.
1200393	1200633	Come on.
1201954	1202774	Oh, there's somebody.
1203134	1204295	And the doorbell rings.
1204715	1205876	More victims!
1207336	1208317	This is your life.
1209757	1210778	Or this is our show.
1213868	1219212	Actually, before we go on to whoever our guest is, I actually would like to make a mention.
1219372	1219752	Would you?
1219932	1220312	Go for it.
1220352	1220573	Yes.
1221513	1222954	This is just a general shout out.
1222994	1228938	This goes to DDR Freak Radio, all the other Bimani radio stations out there.
1228978	1233821	You guys own and keep doing it because we need to keep Bimani on the air and keep everything alive too.
1234600	1239622	I agree, we need to keep doing shit like Bomani X Radio, all those other radio stations out there.
1239682	1240542	Who else is broadcasting?
1240562	1243003	I know there's a user on DDR Freak who has their own station.
1243343	1244463	There's probably about 10 different stations.
1244483	1248465	You put Bomani into live365.com, you're going to get about 10 different stations that come up.
1249185	1251826	And there's commotion going on at the door there.
1251866	1252246	What's going on?
1252286	1253827	Hey, Paul's here.
1254007	1254547	What's up, Paul?
1255007	1265974	We're going to give a shout out to all those other Bomani stations out there, because especially, if you might have heard this past week, I believe it was Thursday, the new royalty rates for internet radio came down.
1266574	1272298	And we're going to have to pay 7 cents for every song heard by 1,000 listeners.
1272358	1276020	Now granted, this station will never, ever, ever have 1,000 listeners.
1276300	1276681	We hope.
1278241	1280122	And if it does, we have ways to control that.
1280262	1281422	Isn't it retroactive too?
1297614	1298635	Thank you for watching!
1311368	1316571	This whole Bomani thing, I'm sure since we're pretty much whoring out Bomani, they really don't give a crap what we're doing.
1316671	1318272	So they probably wouldn't come after us.
1318312	1325135	But still, for everybody else out there, for all the other shows out there, this is a really stupid thing that they're trying to do.
1325276	1327477	It's just trying to charge us for every little thing we do.
1328237	1329398	And we're not going to take it!
1331439	1333040	There's two roots to that.
1333260	1335201	One of them is greed.
1335861	1340704	Number two is called having something crawl up your ass and die.
1341838	1342378	Exactly.
1342678	1343719	That happened to me Tuesday.
1343859	1344819	Don't even care about people.
1345159	1346440	Maybe it's anal greed.
1347480	1348681	That doesn't sound right.
1349281	1350021	Like anal spider?
1350681	1351782	Yeah, like anal spider.
1351922	1354043	But anal spider is cool because they do beat mania stuff.
1357384	1358584	That was my anal spider noise.
1359205	1360565	Let's do that again.
1361205	1363506	Wow.
1363706	1366287	That's not quite what I remember from the song.
1367828	1368788	Was it Macho Gang?
1368988	1370449	You kind of have to get on that base of the...
1371933	1373554	A penny just stuck to me, isn't that crazy?
1374035	1376977	As Rob goes off on another tangent.
1378158	1380599	No, it's the dying giraffe sound from the South Park movie.
1380639	1381560	Hey, Paul's here.
1381580	1382260	Paul, say hi.
1382280	1383361	Give Paul the microphone.
1383421	1384842	Let the adults have the show.
1395231	1396392	Don't make out with the microphone.
1396712	1400515	In other words, don't perform sexual acts on the microphone.
1410871	1417497	Believe me, if we've gone how many months now of playing Bomani and never shutting up about it, like the afternoon.
1417537	1422021	I'm not going to say I don't have a life outside of Bomani because I try to.
1424343	1425905	But it's not everything.
1425985	1428247	But we certainly can fill up two hours of a show.
1428638	1432221	If we spent 15 minutes on each game alone, that would be two hours or more.
1432241	1433482	That's two hours a week that we can fill.
1433502	1434623	So we're talking about firsts.
1435003	1438385	So we want to know everybody's first experience with Bimani and why they're so addicted.
1438405	1440147	So tell us how you lost your Bimani virginity.
1440527	1443789	If it's the heroin needles that shoot out when you do a good job, or what?
1446912	1447692	Paul, that was a question to you.
1448833	1450494	Yes, tell us about your first experience.
1451275	1455238	Well, I started out with DDR and it just...
1456075	1456455	Oh my goodness!
1456475	1457156	I can't believe it!
1457196	1458477	Everything's ruined!
1484477	1485598	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
1485618	1489340	Here's a little number I tossed off recently at the kettlebell.
1489360	1490180	I'm not singing with it this time.
1490220	1493362	Doesn't it all be nice to have a penis?
1493382	1496164	Isn't it frightfully good to have a dog?
1511403	1523619	It's well to have a stiffy, it's divine to own a dick From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick So three chows for your Willy or John Thomas Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake
1524727	1528130	Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your party, or your cock.
1528570	1531332	You can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock.
1531993	1534955	But don't take it out in public, or they will stick you in the dock.
1535195	1538238	And you won't become a bad little big woman.
1538658	1543122	Don't say I don't have enough sound effects to fill up a show or you're going to get subjected to crap like that for two hours.
1543602	1547866	It's like Travis' collection of... No, I got these on my very own thing.
1547926	1549167	Hey, hey, hey.
1549227	1550588	Rob's a big boy now.
1552296	1554057	Jamie was up until 4 a.m.
1554177	1555117	downloading this stuff.
1556377	1557097	Yes, Brad, what?
1557598	1558218	What do we know?
1558298	1559158	Tell us what we know.
1559178	1561219	You know what should be in Beatmania?
1561599	1561819	What?
1562019	1563219	Our good friend Wesley Willis.
1565200	1566220	You remember Wesley Willis.
1566280	1567781	Yes, I do remember Wesley Willis.
1568101	1568961	Do you have any Wesley Willis?
1568981	1570021	I have Wesley Willis.
1570041	1571562	I'm not going to play Wesley Willis right now.
1571642	1572602	Oh, come on.
1572742	1574283	Maybe at the end of the show I'll play Wesley Willis.
1574383	1574663	Okay.
1574823	1576463	That'll be the end credits, though, right?
1576483	1576663	No.
1576863	1577104	Maybe.
1577144	1577504	We'll see.
1577564	1579144	All right.
1579624	1580144	Oh, dear God.
1580164	1581285	I think it's time for a break.
1581305	1581885	I'll stop talking now.
1583292	1589294	When we come back for the break, we'll talk about... Why don't we talk about... Everybody in the community is talking about this this week.
1590154	1590594	Solo 2000.
1591115	1594076	Is it safe for the children?
1594656	1598557	Isn't anybody thinking of the children when we come back?
1619168	1620240	Thanks for watching!
1718891	1721585	A dream, that is real
1795848	1802793	Why is it always the same old thing?
1802873	1804614	Wanna be a man, yeah, you're playing games.
1804654	1807396	If you gotta kid act like your father, the baby ain't yours, then hey, why?
1863514	1866757	We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.
1895504	1896926	We think we figured it out.
1897166	1897948	Orange Lounge Radio
1912172	1918500	Ah, the lovely karaoke stylings of me there in that little diddy one-hit wonder.
1918580	1919101	Yes, what?
1919141	1919882	Can I have your autograph?
1920403	1920543	No.
1921003	1921264	Anyway.
1921704	1922385	It's Rob!
1923406	1924288	It's Rob!
1925369	1925629	Okay.
1926711	1927672	Show me your moves!
1929884	1931946	I just showed him, now he's not going to talk for the next half hour.
1931986	1934948	Now we're really R-rated, you know, we've had nudity on here now.
1935048	1938130	That was our little hippie... I don't know if anyone picked that up.
1938851	1940552	That was our little hippie hoppy set there.
1941272	1942193	Our fresh set.
1942553	1943294	Our booty fresh.
1943494	1944455	Our booty fresh set.
1944595	1947377	Brought to you by... Cracker, starting it off from 2DX.
1947897	1954962	And then two songs from DDR, solo 2000s, a six panel version of DDR, Dream a Dream by Captain Jack, the booty mix.
1955282	1955983	Who that is?
1956323	1969712	My Baby Mama by Anna Kett, finishing that off DDR Solo 2000, most people really don't give a shit about Solo 2000 anymore Solo sucks anyway Exactly, ever since that infamous tournament, that's kind of become the catchphrase How did that happen anyway?
1969732	1981360	You probably know more about the story behind Solo sucks anyway than I do Because I'm sure a lot of people would like to know why, whenever they talk about Solo Somebody always jumps into the thread and goes, Solo sucks anyway I think it resulted from a failed routine
1982660	1984101	I don't know the entire story.
2003068	2003949	Anyway, so that's what this game is about.
2004189	2009713	But DDR Solo, in the news around the community this week, this has everybody talking about something.
2010254	2012395	This is the point where I let my head into my hand.
2012415	2013876	Well, let's talk about the story.
2013896	2014997	I'm going to read this article here.
2016418	2022883	It's from the San Diego Union Tribune, and it's by Brian E. Clark from the San Diego Union Tribune here.
2023784	2023924	And...
2025606	2033093	It talks about the Poway Bowling Alley Arcade replaces a game after used protests the images in the game.
2033994	2036557	Jennifer Stoethan couldn't believe her eyes.
2036677	2046767	There on the Dance Dance Revolution machine, a video game immensely popular with preteens and teens were images of drugs, alcohol, and a scantily clad nurse riding up and down on a syringe.
2048912	2052754	I was appalled to see that stuff flashing on the screen, said the 17-year-old Stofan.
2053535	2058758	And she first saw the pictures way back in March on the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the Poway Fun Ball.
2059238	2063400	She says, I'm a teenager, but I've seen five-year-olds playing this game.
2063520	2066902	As far as I'm concerned, those images are totally unnecessary.
2067363	2072145	Why do they need to have pictures with rows of pills, cocktails, ecstasy, and a syringe?
2072606	2075027	Now, I'd like to know how that girl knew that the pills were ecstasy.
2076365	2080107	He was appalled, yet excited.
2080327	2083729	She's probably seen five-year-olds naked, too.
2083749	2085610	Alright.
2086470	2088491	Well, let's talk about what she did.
2088872	2096916	She basically documented pictures, contacted the company that placed the game in the bowling alley, and convinced the arcade owner to replace the machine.
2096956	2097856	We don't know with what.
2098477	2101558	It would be really, really funny.
2101959	2103700	It would be really funny if it was Humpahorse.
2106051	2107753	That Namco horsey game.
2107773	2107753	2002.
2110195	2111196	Final Furlong.
2112036	2113918	So she basically got her way.
2113998	2115139	She whined, bitched, and moaned.
2115319	2119402	And we shouldn't just say her because obviously she got other people in on this too.
2119442	2120603	Her little coalition.
2120903	2125487	Which happens to share a name with a very big lesbian, gay, bisexual coalition group.
2125607	2127509	The Youth Advocacy Coalition or whatever.
2127969	2129831	Just kind of a funny side note anyway.
2130211	2132793	Who probably lesbians and gays wouldn't really care about.
2133914	2136077	DDR, Solo 2000, they'd probably find it funny.
2136197	2142544	It should also be noted that Solo 2000, just like that movie The Last Starfighter, recruits people for the Army of Satan.
2142964	2144966	I mean, it's widely known knowledge.
2144986	2146228	Hey, I signed up just last week!
2148895	2152756	I don't think a lesbian would have a problem with looking at a nurse riding on a syringe.
2152836	2153377	Not at all.
2154617	2156638	Anyway, so they go on to gloat.
2157038	2160139	We feel really good about what we were able to accomplish.
2160399	2162020	And she graduated from high school.
2162080	2163280	She is a high school graduate.
2163500	2163960	Good for her.
2164701	2167241	And she's going to study film at San Jose State University.
2167341	2171503	So I imagine her next target will probably be in San Jose somewhere.
2172498	2178461	Little kids or even teens don't need to see that stuff, and we were happy the business people we dealt with agreed with us too.
2179642	2183924	So the moral of the story, if you bitch and moan and you threaten to sue, you'll get your way.
2184205	2185345	Watch out, Sunnyvale.
2185425	2186706	She's coming for you.
2186866	2190348	She's protesting these images, yet she's going to be a film student.
2191709	2194730	Isn't that how, like, you know, independent filmmakers, like, win?
2195811	2197332	By being provocative.
2197372	2198492	How do we know she's not going...
2201912	2204053	She's gonna get Sundance shut down for showing titties.
2205815	2207956	But if the nudity is artistic, it's okay.
2208756	2211018	Like Kate Winslet in Titanic, that was artistic nudity.
2211478	2214000	It was ugly nudity also, but it was, you know, anyway.
2215160	2228109	It was... That's the whole thing, is that, you know, this particular organization... See, I don't get, it's not just this organization, it's any organization who decides that there's something out there that they don't like.
2229129	2229650	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2252451	2260516	Um, you know, there's just so much positive about it and they have to focus on all the negativity so a lot of people have to lose out because something crawled up their ass and died.
2260756	2265339	Wait till Solo 2004 comes out with aborted fetuses and crack whores in the background.
2265779	2266259	Oh yeah.
2266279	2268460	Can I be the devil's advocate?
2268621	2269981	Come here, Irene, you want to be the devil's advocate?
2270001	2271002	Come here and tie him to the microphone.
2272283	2273643	We want to hear this from the other perspective.
2273724	2278386	I would have loved to have gotten an interview with this person but I was too lazy so we'll maybe get one next week.
2279627	2279707	Ouch.
2281263	2282103	Oh, what was I going to say?
2282123	2283444	You're going to be devil's advocate.
2283684	2284244	Yeah, I know.
2284824	2285624	I had a thought.
2286064	2286624	It's okay.
2286764	2295446	Okay, you said that just because a band of people got together and protested against something means that, you know, they get their way.
2296107	2302068	But I think it's kind of like if there was a group of murderers out there.
2302588	2307369	Of course that's going to be sickening to some people and they're going to band together and kind of complain about these murderers.
2308089	2310790	So I can't say that I fully agree with
2311707	2314869	What do you think about people that band together and complain about things?
2314929	2317130	Because, you know, sometimes it's for good.
2317170	2319751	I mean, this particular instance, I don't feel so strongly about it.
2319771	2320652	I think she's wrong.
2321512	2324834	But let's not say everyone that does that is terrible.
2325474	2326274	That's about it.
2327035	2329816	Oh, hi there.
2329836	2331017	Hey, guess what, Rob?
2331257	2331937	Eat my ass.
2332658	2335119	Yeah, so, any comments?
2335919	2336380	Am I talking?
2336440	2337320	I'm talking like Waylon.
2337500	2338161	Yeah, that's okay.
2338301	2339001	Any comments?
2340161	2341502	It's a very good point you're making.
2341542	2342062	You're wrong!
2346343	2354705	I think that part of it just has to do with the fact that people are generally closed-minded.
2355446	2359827	People aren't willing to accept an idea that might be different than their own.
2360965	2366589	And so they're going to stick to that one idea and think that everybody has to adhere to it.
2367189	2369791	Where, you know, apparently we disagree.
2369811	2371311	I mean, that's obvious because we like DVR.
2371332	2375154	But, I mean, not just with that situation, but with a ton of situations in the world.
2375754	2380217	It's intolerance and just generally being closed-minded.
2380657	2384199	You know, I'm going to be the devil's advocate for the devil's advocate.
2384360	2384700	Okay.
2384920	2386001	I need to make another point.
2386021	2387381	We need to fill this damn show somehow.
2387401	2388422	Go for it.
2388642	2389823	Let's just make this the Irene show.
2390143	2395687	Okay, how about the people that were, you know, the kind of people that I can see being against is like the Nazis.
2397308	2400670	You know, at one time people thought the Nazis were cool.
2400690	2405273	I don't know if anybody here necessarily thought the Nazis were cool.
2405493	2407715	I don't think Jewish people ever thought the Nazis were very cool.
2407895	2412662	Well, that's because people were shocked.
2412962	2416467	That's another example of the sheep mentality I'm often fond of bringing up.
2416487	2421074	Yes, and you know, I think Adolf Hitler just had some insecurities, because he only had one testicle.
2422144	2426949	and he's just like, fuck you all, I'm just going to kill everyone because I have one testicle.
2427349	2429091	How did you know he had one testicle?
2429271	2430092	Wouldn't you like to know?
2430992	2439680	Well, it's been reported from unknown sources because I just read a bunch of books and shut up.
2439780	2440121	Nerd.
2440361	2440841	You can read.
2440861	2441642	Fuck you.
2442743	2444825	At least I'm not a geep like Paul.
2444845	2445245	A geep?
2445285	2446767	Yeah, he has a geep on his shirt.
2447387	2452008	But yeah, so, I mean, I guess it just depends on the situation, you know.
2452569	2453489	It's circumstantial.
2454929	2459051	If you have beliefs... Oh, that's my cue.
2459471	2459991	I gotta go now.
2460011	2460731	I'm just kidding.
2461111	2463992	You were saying, if you have beliefs, continue.
2464092	2464652	Oh, I don't know.
2465113	2466373	The giraffe noise threw me off.
2466393	2470794	Yeah, if you have beliefs... Good point.
2471295	2472495	I know, thanks, thanks.
2473976	2496663	I think the general moral of that is even though there are people who do occasionally win to take away things, not necessarily take away things that we enjoy, but just to inflict their closed-minded opinion on the masses, there should always be the people who are willing to stand against that, who are willing to say something, you know, we don't think this is right.
2497864	2499464	You have no right to censor our lives.
2499884	2501945	Yeah, and I also, one last thing, like
2502529	2505071	If they don't like it so much, why don't they just not go there?
2505771	2506772	That's my whole opinion.
2506952	2512155	It's like, why ruin the party for everybody else just because you have a problem with it?
2512215	2513616	Nobody is forcing you to play this game.
2513676	2518860	You know, everyone's so hip on, like, let's, you know, everyone puts disclaimers on things and stuff, you know?
2519340	2524383	And why is it that this particular incident, they have to take away our fun?
2525004	2525324	Oh, okay.
2525504	2527626	Oh, okay.
2527826	2528406	Okay, go ahead.
2528546	2531168	Okay, here's probably what the situation is for this one.
2531798	2533419	Okay, you said it's at a bowling alley.
2533799	2544766	Well, I'm guessing it's probably someone that's part of a league or a bowling league or something like that that sees a stupid game playing in the background when they're waiting between frames to bowl.
2545266	2546207	Bowling for God.
2546287	2547147	Christian bowling.
2547668	2548768	Highway to pins to heaven.
2549209	2554692	Anyway, so probably it's just someone with nothing better to do than complain about something if it wasn't, you know...
2555789	2560513	Arguing against people killing whales or small animals or something like that.
2560573	2560973	Children.
2561333	2561874	Children.
2562774	2563875	Abortion or whatever.
2563955	2565937	I'm sure they would have picked on something else.
2566277	2569940	It's just like a starter to other things to debate about.
2570420	2578326	So I just think it's probably no big deal, but like I've read on the responses for these, that not really anyone's worried about it.
2578586	2581128	They don't really think it's going to go too far, and I probably agree with them.
2583467	2587688	I don't see why the bowling alley owner decided to get rid of the game in the first place.
2588568	2590569	It must not have been making him any money or something.
2590589	2592089	There must be other factors involved.
2592429	2595570	The thing I see, let me be the extremist here for a second.
2595770	2597830	Okay.
2598330	2606452	Even on that one instance, that machine getting taken out is doing more damage to a larger amount of people than...
2608738	2611780	The images on the machine are doing to the little kids, I believe.
2612181	2620286	And let's be an extremist here and say that what if all the machines eventually do get taken out because this does go way too far, which I doubt it will.
2621227	2627592	Then that's definitely doing even more damage to a larger amount of people than the little images of syringes and naked women.
2628362	2629003	Fuckin' A!
2629163	2634910	You see more of that kind of stuff on TV anyway than you do on the frickin' machines and arcades.
2635050	2638995	Inside at the bowling alleys, all the parents are drunk anyway, so who gives a shit?
2639055	2643521	I know, they don't want to watch their own kids, so they put something that has syringes and stuff to baby for their kids.
2643701	2655129	The only other thing I can think of why the manager would agree with something is if it's supposed to be a family environment and enough families banded together and said this is not the type of environment we want our children around.
2655269	2656310	It's the Mormon Bowl.
2656470	2661553	Their protests might have actually had some credence with the manager.
2661974	2667818	But even so, I mean, first of all, they stand to lose money because I know for a fact DVR machines make a ton of money.
2668338	2670960	And also, from having worked at three different arcades...
2671520	2673742	I do know that they make those rating stickers.
2674523	2678266	You know how you have your ratings on your video games to have at home?
2678786	2681228	They have those rating stickers for arcade machines.
2681629	2684151	Corporately owned arcades are actually required to have them.
2685372	2686753	At least I know Namco did.
2687193	2693438	I'm not too sure about Gotham, but I know that most of them do.
2693478	2696381	I personally went through and put a lot of those stickers on machines.
2696981	2703105	So that any parent who had their child with them could look at the machine, look at the rating, and see if that's really something they wanted their kid to play.
2703726	2710531	Unfortunately, parents don't want to watch their children themselves and do their job, so they let the arcades babysit their children for them.
2710711	2715534	It's the thing I notice at Golf Land all the time.
2715934	2717535	Parents bring their kids there.
2718636	2719496	and then just turn them loose.
2719736	2720637	They run around everywhere.
2720677	2726898	They're stomping on all sorts of machines and shooting things.
2727818	2732019	What's worst of all is that when we're playing on DDR, they start coming and playing with us.
2732079	2736300	It's like eight people playing on the machine at once because all these little kids want to jump on the arrows because, oh, shiny thing.
2736320	2738021	You're getting into my territory here.
2738081	2738761	I know, I know, I know.
2739241	2744284	But, why don't these parents watch the kids when they drop them off here?
2744545	2752270	Then you would be able to take an active role in what they're playing, because if you just let your kids turn loose, there is way worse arcade games out there besides DDR.
2752770	2760115	What if this bowling alley, I would like to know if this bowling alley has like a police 911 machine, where you're shooting people and there's...
2760635	2762216	Lost Drogas and everything.
2763796	2765196	I have to say something.
2765496	2769198	Why don't we just band together and say, we're offended by these god people.
2770238	2771578	We just need a derby owners club.
2771618	2772959	Because that's not politically correct.
2773159	2775679	And race horses all day and teach good horse raising values.
2775940	2777180	That's unconstitutional.
2777460	2780181	I say we just screw DDR and we all get a Neopet.
2780241	2780601	Fuck you.
2781641	2783582	I don't want a Neopet.
2783622	2785023	My Neopet wasn't fed.
2785803	2786803	I'm going to throw it at you now.
2787583	2788484	Okay.
2788604	2789164	Yeah, we're weird.
2789444	2790485	Malnourished Neopet.
2790545	2791425	I think, Rob.
2791445	2792085	Okay, yes?
2792705	2796367	I think it's about, we should, you know, definitely have my rant.
2796487	2798548	Okay, we'll get to your rant after the next break.
2800842	2803983	However, I was going to make a point and I just forgot it.
2804023	2806164	So I guess I won't make a point.
2806304	2807425	The points at Cal Expo.
2807505	2809086	What do you guys think is going to happen after this?
2809666	2809946	After what?
2809966	2812927	Do you think that more machines are going to get taken out from other places?
2813147	2813528	No.
2813588	2819210	I mean, this person said they're going to go on to DDR Freak, which is probably the most well-known DDR site that's out there.
2819630	2824132	Go look at their machine locations page and start hitting every Solo 2000 machine out there.
2824392	2825613	Did you see how many were on there?
2825853	2826113	A lot.
2826353	2830295	I think, honestly, the owners of these places...
2830922	2835084	They've had them long enough to know, you know, what's going on in the game.
2836005	2838947	They've had them long enough to know the kind of content is inside.
2839527	2843750	You know, and there's, you know, I don't, I think they would have taken them out by now.
2844270	2846231	If they really felt passionately about that.
2846691	2847412	And here comes Brad.
2847832	2849313	And here's Matt, he hasn't been here.
2849413	2851114	Thank you.
2851254	2855216	Actually, I think what's going to happen is if people are going to call up these establishments with the Solo 2000 machines,
2856690	2864911	and they're just going to get laughed at because these people are going to be like, yeah, I'm just going to take this machine that I paid a couple grand for and just get rid of it because you don't like it.
2865492	2867052	Okay, go screw yourself.
2867612	2868972	That's what they're probably going to end up saying.
2869012	2876094	It's just ridiculous to even try to take these machines out because of a few images that flash in the background that you don't even notice anyways.
2876594	2878714	Which I'm sure they'd be like, oh, it's subliminal then.
2878754	2879494	They don't notice it.
2879614	2883855	It gets in their subconscious and they'll become murderers and rapists.
2885416	2886357	Just one thing, though.
2886597	2888698	I mean, it may be a sad thing, I should say.
2889279	2893481	But, unfortunately, greed ruins over morality in a lot of cases.
2894182	2900986	I mean, are you going to throw away an income of well into the thousands because it offends somebody?
2901687	2905609	I mean, true, there's some offensive material that I think should be removed on occasion.
2906270	2912154	But on top of that, though, this is an instance where this small group is not really going to be able to make much of a difference.
2913254	2913935	I mean, true, right?
2914760	2915401	Yeah, I agree.
2915561	2919184	And in fact, also, let's just, you know, say for instance that they do get away with it.
2919584	2920805	Solo 2000 gone.
2921125	2922226	Really, would you miss it?
2922726	2923507	I wouldn't miss it.
2924087	2928731	I mean, it was just, I don't miss the game.
2928871	2930252	I don't even care if they get rid of it.
2930812	2931413	Good for them.
2931513	2932253	Get a better game.
2932353	2933674	Get a Max 2 machine.
2934275	2938879	Hell, I mean... Well, okay, but, okay, say you go and upgrade the Solo 2000 to a fourth mix.
2939439	2939659	Okay?
2940079	2941280	Look at the background of Kick the Can.
2941401	2942722	It's a bunch of flying heroin needles.
2942802	2944623	You've still got the same thing going on.
2946445	2948546	I still think Secret Rendezvous has the best video.
2949007	2949467	Yeah, that's right.
2949907	2957053	Then they'll just want a Max 2 machine removed because there's lesbians all over the Secret Rendezvous video and it's a secret message that everybody should become a lesbian.
2957233	2957633	Lesbians.
2958354	2958574	Okay.
2962119	2963860	Solo 2000 is a good machine.
2965020	2965680	It's fun.
2966220	2967021	It attracts crowds.
2967061	2968521	People actually go look for them.
2969061	2970502	We have a new face to the show.
2970522	2972642	Glenn would like to contribute an opinion.
2973082	2974343	An appearance and an opinion.
2974383	2979264	Here's the thing about the whole... Because basically what it is, it's censorship.
2979664	2981245	And censorship never stops.
2981505	2983525	It just keeps going further and further and further.
2983565	2985866	And nobody's going to be happy until there's nothing left.
2985946	2987826	Because somebody will be offended by something.
2988286	2990067	Either it's degradation of women...
2990646	2998928	by the songs or images or whether it's subliminal messages that they think they hear or drug use or anything.
2999189	3000089	It will never end.
3000209	3007671	So if they keep... If it's a trend and they keep caving into these people, then DDR will be gone.
3009111	3010712	And then there'll be something next after that.
3010992	3013413	So a message to all you arcade owners out there.
3013913	3014753	Grow some balls!
3015173	3015874	Only in America.
3015894	3016974	Wash your pussy!
3018786	3024190	and a message out there also as well to the coalition there that's taking out all the machines out there.
3024250	3026412	First, we would love to hear your opinion.
3026452	3035918	So please contact this station and we'll give you a fair interview and some equal time and let you present your side of the story because we're curious what your motivations are and maybe you can talk us out of playing DDR.
3038940	3039501	That was funny.
3039741	3045125	Second off to the coalition, there's a place called Laser Force in Sacramento.
3045225	3046486	Go take their machine.
3048102	3052505	If you need a place to properly deposit this machine, I live at... Alright, anyway.
3053146	3058049	We'll talk more about Laser Force and other evil Bomani things when we come back.
3058510	3061171	In the meantime, we're going to play something from Drum Mania.
3061592	3064374	We're going to play something from... Well, it's actually Guitar Freaks also.
3064834	3068557	We're going to play our namesake here, the lovely Orange Lounge.
3068657	3070498	And their little medley from the new guitar.
3071218	3073280	Yes, very good.
3073320	3073760	Here we go.
3074821	3076262	We'll be back in about five minutes.
3086073	3087834	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3169841	3172163	A-flat, I believe, a little sharp.
3172183	3172783	Get this thing off.
3172803	3173644	Get this thing off.
3173664	3174324	Get this thing off.
3313140	3316365	Kale kale kuta kuta kuta ee oh ee oh
3441528	3444093	Cargale, cuta, cuta, cuta, eh oh, eh oh
3506225	3506745	My bad.
3507145	3517589	And now I would like to present to you the comic stylings of Irene, future comedian extraordinaire.
3517609	3518249	Keep clapping.
3519949	3527152	So these two muffins were baking in the oven, and the first one says to the other one,
3527938	3529622	You know, it's getting pretty hot in here.
3530363	3533089	And the second one's like, holy shit, a talking muffin!
3738937	3746783	Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Monty Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
3747384	3757411	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
3758392	3761815	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
3763156	3765237	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3765297	3767318	We're live for our very first show.
3768059	3769079	It's about 8 o'clock.
3769320	3770240	We're halfway through it.
3770280	3770740	What do you know?
3770840	3773001	We made it this far, so let's see if we can get to the other end.
3774182	3780546	I think now would be a good time in the show for Jamie to be given space to do her little rant.
3780566	3781426	How does that sound, Jamie?
3781686	3783127	That sounds delightful, Ron.
3783267	3784227	All right, let's hear it.
3784268	3786309	Let's hear your little rant of the week.
3786789	3789050	This is Jamie's big fuck you of the week.
3789590	3790331	That goes to...
3791454	3794818	I would have to say parents at Roseville Golf Land.
3795398	3796780	Who agrees with me here?
3798942	3809954	Especially one delightful lady who I saw putting her three-year-old child on the keyboard mania machine to change a diaper.
3810635	3812917	I knew a lot of people called that a shitty game, but...
3815623	3829881	She was checking his diaper, but she put the child on the keyboard, and I couldn't help myself but go up there and go, Excuse me, ma'am, and mentally I was going, and I used the term loosely, would you mind moving your child off of this machine?
3830141	3833085	Or I could go get management and make them, you know, have you pay for it.
3834372	3835153	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3856545	3864468	Walk off while their three-year-old, not three-year-old, more like a five-year-old was holding one of those big guitar controllers, which I have issues holding.
3864488	3865328	Mommy, it hurts.
3866069	3867449	It feels like burning.
3868129	3871791	But, you know, and I actually, I was playing drumming at the time.
3871811	3877753	I called the parent back and said, you need to get your, you know, you need to help your child because if they drop this on their foot, they will likely break their toes.
3877893	3879875	Attention to parents at Golfland.
3880155	3882177	This goes for not just Roseville Golf Club, but any golf club.
3882197	3882898	Any arcade.
3882958	3884560	Jamie circulates a lot.
3884740	3885781	She gets around, Jamie.
3885901	3886342	Oh, yeah.
3886402	3887603	At many different arcades.
3887623	3888404	She gets around.
3888424	3889405	I am such an arcade whore.
3889445	3892268	If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.
3892928	3894410	Yes, I will spank your child.
3894810	3896532	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
3897412	3899273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3926691	3929592	You know, like that prime example of the people we got kicked out of Golfland the other night.
3931033	3931553	Oh, God.
3931933	3934094	You know, they were getting up, bumming around the machine.
3934134	3935334	We had management kick them out.
3935915	3938456	Because, well, we actually got a restraining order that night.
3938836	3941417	We got a Golfland restraining order the other night.
3941437	3942697	That was awesome.
3942717	3947319	This guy was hopping up on the Parapara machine while I was playing, and I nearly whacked him in the face one.
3947819	3950260	And then he was making this act out of himself.
3950280	3952161	Did he almost get hit with your ass, Deluxe?
3952181	3952241	Yes.
3952401	3955083	No, that was when I stuck my fist out to do the side.
3955743	3964369	I mean, you know how you have to stick your hand out to do... Well, I don't know how many power lists we have listening, but you stick out your hand side to side to do Deluxe, and I nearly palmed the guy in the face.
3965130	3967291	And honestly, he deserved it because he was a moron.
3967351	3971714	But still, you know, I can't go around hitting every stupid people I see or else my hand would fall off.
3972555	3975537	So, but anyway, that's the rant, you know.
3976137	3979800	If we have any parents who are listening to the show where I seriously doubt it,
3980558	3987264	But still, if you have younger siblings, you know, make sure that someone's got an eye on them, you know.
3987324	3989506	Look out for the little ones because we sure as hell aren't.
3990286	3991027	It's not our job.
3991067	3991768	It's the parents' job.
3991828	3992969	We'll step on your children.
3993589	3995371	Yeah, we're going to step on them and then they'll learn.
3997168	4003509	I don't know, I would not consciously step on a little child if I couldn't help it.
4004310	4005230	Anyway, that's my rant.
4005450	4022634	If you'd like to comment on Jamie's Fuck You of the Week, or you'd like to comment on anything else we talked about the past hour of the show, I encourage you to join our chat room, which is located on server irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net and it's just channel...
4023454	4046683	Orange Lounge, all one word so we look forward to seeing you in there and we'll take your comments and maybe talk about some of them on the show in future weeks on the Orange Lounge we are looking into getting the phone system here so we can take phone calls on the air but we're kind of doing some test runs to see what kind of reception the show gets because that's going to be a large investment to get the phones here so it might be a little while before we get those but we'd like to start taking phone calls, that would be cool
4048527	4049868	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4070466	4073807	Now you can initiate a national boycott at Laser Force.
4074088	4074768	International.
4075068	4079670	The one issue with that is that I don't want them to go targeting every place that has a Solo.
4079890	4081250	Like the Walmart and Lodi.
4082691	4083791	Now the Walmart and Lodi rules.
4084391	4084972	Yes, it does.
4086372	4089873	Any place you can buy Pringles and then go straight to play DDR just rules.
4092655	4096376	And I win so many toys out of the crane machines there, it's not even funny.
4097082	4098863	But let's hear why Laser Force sucks.
4099324	4100144	Tell your Laser Force story.
4100184	4117616	Well, this has to do with the day that Iguana Girl and I and a certain unnamed, well, cockspanker, cockspanker for bucks, who is no longer worthy of a name.
4118657	4125322	We all went to Laser Force to check out the new solo machine right around the corner from my house.
4126963	4135608	and people, please don't come to my house anyway we go in and we're all playing nobody's getting up and doing anything
4136574	4145422	and, you know, this woman's asking questions, you know, we're answering, she's got her kids there and then this group of little girls gets up by the machine and we've all been taking our turns and using a coin line.
4145482	4147643	Anyone with common sense can see what a coin line is.
4149265	4157912	Eventually the mother got up and was complaining that, oh, you know, my kid wanted to get up here and, you know, we explained the coin line and we're like, okay, well, you know, we're going to go ahead and let your kid go.
4158292	4162516	We'll go ahead and, you know, trade this turn, just give us some tokens because we'd already had tokens in the machine.
4163056	4164558	And she's like, no, I gotta go, and they left.
4164858	4167901	And then management came up and just, like, tried to ream us.
4168581	4171444	We were being, they were being very... Oh my goodness!
4172264	4173265	I can't believe it!
4173686	4174787	Everything's ruined!
4174847	4176588	As many times as I can fit it in.
4183399	4186821	Anyway, we had issues with them.
4187561	4192444	Basically, we just said we weren't going to come back, and I made sure to let everybody I knew.
4192524	4197287	And so far, I think we've had a fairly successful boycott, haven't we?
4197327	4199769	I mean, I understand that their business isn't doing very well.
4201149	4207413	But I mean, it's just, though, nobody really plays the solo there anyway, so they should just give me the machine.
4208534	4210295	And then we wouldn't have to boycott them anymore.
4211463	4213109	That is crime logic.
4213129	4217445	Yeah, but then that woman's gonna have to come to your house and remove the machine because she finds it offensive.
4219278	4220740	Hey, it's my house.
4221200	4222421	Yes, but the more furniture.
4222802	4223843	It's offended.
4223943	4225925	Hey, Jamie has a guard cat.
4226365	4227326	Yes, Shermie would kill her.
4227626	4230549	Shermie would roll around on the floor and out-cute her.
4232251	4239538	But no, if somebody came to my house saying, you can't play this in your own home, that'd be the point.
4239558	4242161	I'd break out the katana and decapitate somebody, okay?
4242401	4242822	Whoa!
4243622	4245504	Oh, it's evil, Jamie, ladies and gentlemen.
4245564	4246845	It's in my house.
4246925	4247946	It's self-defense.
4248006	4248526	Jamie's on.
4248707	4249107	Jamie's on.
4249147	4249367	No.
4251749	4252690	Oh, all those steroids.
4253290	4254251	Making me feel badly.
4254271	4255272	Okay.
4255913	4256994	I like that.
4257354	4258395	Laser Force sucks.
4258615	4260076	I mean, I'm sorry.
4260116	4266462	The only official laser tag game that I can, you know, put my name behind is QZAR.
4266482	4266642	QZAR.
4266662	4267723	Played it for four years.
4267863	4268083	Spent...
4268630	4270651	Oh good, 15 grand there.
4270691	4274534	We should say that Loki was a Cusar nerd long before he was a DDR nerd.
4274574	4275995	We need to hear it for Team Sack.
4276235	4279697	Yes, Cusar, it was my first love.
4280058	4285181	Once Cusar left last year around May, I was very sad, still sad to this day.
4285821	4289944	And anyways, DDR became my new addiction, so...
4292142	4305213	I just have to say, QZR rules, Laser Force sucks ass, and they were almost out of business just when QZR went and left, and then they came back just like a festering sore, so they can die.
4305734	4307295	It really does smell like pee in there.
4308796	4309637	And they smell like pee.
4310738	4313901	I'm glad I'm not the only person that noticed how bad it stinks in there.
4315443	4322107	Keep in mind, though, we've also got LaserX at Country Club Lanes, and we still have whatever thing is at Golfland.
4322567	4324088	I'm sorry, you're talking about LaserX?
4326470	4332914	But there are local alternatives to LaserForce if you have to shoot the infrared beam at somebody.
4333655	4339839	And no, unfortunately, I do not have dramatic music to play when people are crying over their losses, but I do have Cam Laughter.
4346829	4348230	We can play Flowers for Albion.
4348970	4350612	Oh yeah, I could load that one.
4351072	4351392	Anyway.
4354855	4356777	House is so crazy right now.
4356817	4362001	There's people in here playing... I banned... Didn't I ban that song from being played in the house?
4362995	4388887	Stupid Crack Baby Oh my god, it's the evil Crack Baby I know, let's I see sitting in the corner over there, my roommates over there in the corner crying Let's bring them over here, I want to ask Brian a few questions Come here, come here Let Brian have the microphone here You gotta hold the mic far away from you because it's very sensitive It's like a penis, it's very sensitive Okay Don't get too close to the head or you're gonna get shot Anyway
4392288	4394150	I don't want to hear about you and Glenn at night.
4394170	4397874	Hey, hey, hey, hey, if you ever played, if you ever played DDR.
4398414	4399235	Yes, I have, Ron.
4399315	4399916	And what do you think?
4402658	4404860	It's a penis envy contest at best.
4406422	4408164	Jamie doesn't have a penis, last time I checked.
4408524	4409285	But I can make one.
4409345	4409725	I can make one.
4415342	4420247	What do you think of this whole thing, this show, this house that you co-reside in being transformed?
4420787	4426032	My house has a complete disaster area right now being overran by a bunch of geeks.
4428354	4429595	Hey, wait a minute, that's me.
4429915	4431437	And I'm stuck in the middle of it.
4432858	4434079	You're now an honorary geek.
4434199	4435540	You're the meat in the geek sandwich.
4437100	4438782	Oh, that was just a bad image.
4439442	4445868	That was just not somewhere I wanted to be.
4445908	4448670	Brian and Meat at the same time, quotes Irene.
4450031	4453895	And followed by a... Very descriptive.
4454115	4456637	Any comments you want to add out there to the Bomani people listening?
4456657	4458399	Because we have quite a few people listening right now.
4458879	4462002	Is there anything you want to say to the addicts out there at Bomani?
4462967	4470989	and besides the fact that they turn my house completely upside down when you throw these types of things and that I'm going, I have no house and no life right now.
4471009	4472390	Well, there's a pool.
4472430	4473110	You could go swim.
4473550	4474450	That's quite all right.
4475511	4476391	Here's a ball, Brian.
4476411	4477191	Why don't you go bounce it?
4477711	4478551	Thanks, Rob.
4478651	4481652	I actually want to thank you very much for the use of the... Well, thank you.
4481672	4482873	At least someone.
4482913	4483773	Yay, Brian.
4486519	4487741	I'll make an edit in your honor.
4489042	4489222	Aww.
4489603	4490544	To Pink Dinosaur.
4494809	4495349	Okay, that's it.
4495870	4497051	Thanks for being on the show, Brian.
4497072	4497452	We appreciate it.
4497572	4498573	Woo, Brian!
4499034	4499394	Alright.
4499574	4500455	I'm the only one happy.
4501497	4503039	Yeah, and you don't have a microphone.
4503059	4503119	Woo!
4506063	4506483	What now?
4507724	4509105	Let's get away from Bomani.
4509125	4510466	You're right, we can't fill two hours with Bomani.
4510486	4510746	Yes, we can.
4510806	4512808	Or what do you want to talk about then?
4513368	4513888	Bomani.
4514329	4514889	What else is Bomani?
4514909	4515610	What do you want to talk about?
4515630	4516330	And you know what?
4516630	4519092	Our personal cross-dresser is not here tonight.
4519838	4521260	Yeah, Ryan was supposed to be here tonight.
4521280	4521581	Where'd he go?
4521601	4524965	Yes, our cross-dressing fellow admin is not here tonight.
4525326	4525966	Where is he at?
4526748	4527809	I knew he had to work today.
4527829	4529451	He's out cross-dressing playing Para somewhere.
4529712	4534017	I knew he had to work today, so maybe he didn't show up because of that.
4534318	4535039	He's out working.
4535199	4536561	What corner is he working today?
4538890	4541131	That would probably be one of the corners of the power machine.
4542691	4547992	But if my ototo-chan is listening tonight, dude, get here.
4548832	4552293	Let's fill it with witty banter.
4553073	4553353	Okay.
4553893	4554193	Okay.
4555133	4556074	Well, you come on.
4556434	4557134	What do you want to talk about?
4557514	4559674	Is there anything about Monty really you want to talk about?
4560454	4561475	Yeah, sure.
4561635	4563755	How about Matt say something?
4564878	4584223	I'd like to announce, for all those people that do play The Sims out there, for DWI, actually, Bimani Ruler, you might know him from DDR Mania X, he's having a blitz for the next two weeks, he's going to be releasing a new file every day, and if anyone hasn't played his stuff, do play it, it's awesome.
4584523	4589884	Today, in fact, his release was the Classic Party Triathlon, which I have to say was...
4590544	4591165	It was awesome.
4591866	4594811	And so go try that, and that's it.
4596954	4600980	Everyone watch the webcam, because every once in a while something crazy is going to pop up.
4601621	4602702	Something out of control.
4603257	4605758	Something you didn't expect, something crazy and wild.
4634565	4638808	And Brad comes back from the webcam room with this weird grin on his face.
4639489	4640329	Should we fear?
4641390	4642531	Should we be scared?
4642631	4644533	Maybe you should look at the, uh, cam.
4644573	4647435	Hopefully it got caught.
4647695	4649436	It looks like somebody's parrying the deluxe.
4649676	4656281	That's, um, that's Brian playing DDR after he just... Brian's playing DDR after he was just in here slamming the rest of us.
4656361	4660264	I know, now he's going, see, it's more truth that Vamani just owns everybody.
4660364	4660705	I'm sorry.
4660725	4660945	I think not.
4662466	4664372	Okay, Paul goes to play DDR now.
4664392	4665134	Where's my picture?
4665515	4665816	Okay.
4666317	4668724	Anyway, so were we going to...
4670600	4670760	Yes.
4670820	4671781	Irene has an idea.
4672181	4673982	I was going to... Okay, go ahead.
4674002	4675003	What were you going to say?
4675043	4679106	I was going to say, we could talk about Max 2, because that's what everybody talks about these days.
4679126	4680186	We have Burning Heat now.
4680206	4683408	We just unlocked Burning Heat yesterday, which is kind of a big deal.
4683648	4686931	It's really the only song anybody seems to care about in Max 2, is Burning Heat.
4687211	4695236	And Kakumei, but Kakumei kind of... It was the big deal in the beginning, but then as people started unlocking Burning Heat, it was just like, Oh my god, Burning Heat!
4695376	4696677	Burning Heat makes me cum.
4699177	4702438	So what do you guys think about Max 2?
4702478	4705639	Max 2 was the first new DDR that I had a reason to get excited over.
4705779	4709900	Max 2 is everything that Max should have been.
4710100	4712500	And I think that's kind of been the opinion across the board.
4712540	4715081	Because it's got way more songs than Fifth Mix had.
4715101	4715681	Well, no, I'm sorry.
4715701	4717121	It's got about the same amount of songs as Fifth Mix had.
4717541	4719161	But Max had like 40 songs.
4719181	4719762	It had nothing.
4720362	4721362	Max had way more.
4721382	4721802	It was nice.
4722082	4727286	So what's missing from Max 2 that you'd like to see in our next installment of DDR?
4727346	4729468	In Max 3, if they should actually take it that far?
4729488	4731309	I want the ability to have flat dark mode.
4732190	4733551	Flat dark mode.
4733571	4736173	Because dark and flat run on the same modifier, so you can't use them both.
4737043	4749211	I think, you know, we should be able to have more songs and less, maybe not less Oni modes, but make Oni modes, make more Oni modes accessible at first and not unlocking a lot of Oni modes.
4749231	4754534	Because I noticed we unlocked a lot of Oni modes and hardly any of them were songs.
4754614	4757696	I think they're even between Oni and extra.
4757916	4758277	Yeah.
4758297	4758637	Or close.
4758717	4762099	And I think people want more songs to play because Oni mode is,
4762699	4768663	I guess, in my opinion, a little bit harder for people because it's a perfect attack thing, you know, or a great attack.
4769103	4770263	Yeah, it's really hard.
4770464	4779969	Now, remember in 4th Mix how they had the, you could come home and make your own non-stops on the home version of 3rd Mix and save it to the card and then take it to the arcade and play your own non-stop?
4779989	4781270	They should do something like that for Oni.
4781750	4787334	I can see why they hesitate doing it because then everybody would just make a 10 song non-stop of a bunch of basics and they'd be able to stay on the machine all day.
4787674	4792897	But maybe limit the homemade non-stops to as many songs as you would have on the normal game.
4793398	4797220	Yeah, or maybe a certain amount of sets you have to have in a song or something like that.
4797240	4802323	I actually think that it might work better to do something very similar to how 2DX has it.
4802763	4804745	You know, have an expert course.
4805445	4805965	Oh, yeah!
4805985	4807786	That's kind of what Oni is, in a way.
4807826	4808746	That's a good idea.
4822831	4825572	But then there's people out there that maybe want to play Oni that can't play Maniacs.
4825592	4827793	Do you think that they maybe should have had an easy Oni course?
4828193	4829514	I know, exactly.
4829714	4830915	Just plain devil's advocate.
4831595	4835837	What I'd like to see would be to have actually more unlockable stuff.
4835897	4837297	Not necessarily more songs.
4837357	4839418	I mean, more songs would obviously be great.
4839778	4844620	But let's say, for instance, we could have different sets for a song being added in or something like that.
4844680	4845441	Or maybe even...
4846877	4858988	I don't know, just have like sort of a challenge mode where you play and you get more points, you know, to go towards, you know, unlocking songs, but have it be like a certain really hard, strange thing that you haven't seen before.
4859128	4863752	Or even, you know, bringing back solo via megamixes where you have three songs.
4863993	4865214	Megamixes are pretty cool.
4865254	4866375	That's something I'd like to see come back.
4867732	4877536	You remember how in Solo 2000, which is getting way too much talk time on the show tonight, you have the, like, one chorus had Afronova, Dropout, and I think Wild Rush.
4878056	4881457	And the cool thing about it is it wasn't just a non-stop, the songs actually mixed together.
4881917	4882317	That's pretty neat.
4882357	4883318	I remember that.
4884098	4886259	I guess, well, go ahead, finish your talk, because I'm going to change the subject a little.
4886819	4887159	Oh, okay.
4887199	4889660	Well, I was just about the different steps, like Matt was saying.
4890180	4895562	What I kind of missed was, it was kind of cool, I think it was on one of the versions of Third Mix, there was alternate steps for some of the songs.
4896082	4898465	I think it was like, down, down, you know.
4899206	4901750	It was the club append steps, actually.
4901790	4904073	They had it for like, Brilliant to You, Keep On Moving.
4904473	4905815	I'd love to see some of that come back.
4906676	4908118	What about new stuff?
4908138	4911102	We've been talking about a lot of old stuff we'd like to see make a return.
4911502	4913405	How do you think Konami can keep...
4914306	4915366	Thanks for watching!
4930932	4932853	Prevent themselves from releasing a DDR final.
4932893	4935595	What can they do to keep... They can put a foot pedal.
4936456	4937236	On DDR?
4938817	4941999	I've often thought that they need to do partner solo.
4942580	4946542	Well, you know, have the six panel solo set up, but with two players.
4946702	4949364	I mean, instead of having the linked machines like they work now.
4950945	4952726	Not if you put enough space in between the machine.
4953346	4956569	Or set it up like the three player Parapara.
4957529	4961370	where you have three panels with the large monitor in the front.
4961430	4965812	DDR could be made to accommodate that and have it with Solo.
4966472	4972494	I would like to see DDR on a humongous screen like, I say pump it up, is on a huge screen.
4972814	4975435	I just don't like, though, how... Go to Fry.
4975915	4979136	I don't like... Oh, I don't like the setup.
4979416	4982937	That's something that's worth talking about here if we want to change the subject a little bit.
4982957	4984077	We'll talk about that when we come back from break.
4984237	4985038	Let's save that for later.
4985078	4985958	Let's keep talking about mechs.
4987441	4988741	Max is maximum.
4989101	4997083	The thing I don't like about Pump is it's got a huge screen, but then it's got this humongous box that just kind of sits out there, and the screen goes back.
4997123	4999804	It's like looking at the end of a tunnel to see what you're looking at.
4999864	5000424	It's kind of odd.
5000464	5005325	I think I'd like it to look more like 2DX, which is a giant freaking huge... I think you're too tall for Pump It Up.
5005425	5006005	I'm too tall.
5006125	5012806	Another thing you can add to it would be more modifiers to, like, say, for instance, stuff you can do with the arrows.
5013167	5014407	Like, have them all mixed up.
5014547	5015167	Have, um...
5015871	5024658	Some things I thought, even for doing some of my edits and stuff, maybe even have it where, like, stuff in the background kind of helps you, you know, not to be able to see the arrows just right.
5024678	5027080	You know, have a bunch of arrows all of a sudden appear in the background.
5027460	5028661	Just crazy shit like that.
5029342	5037989	Well, it's kind of, a lot of people say Flash in the Night was like that on Macs, because when it would go Flash, the screen would do this seizure thing, like, amazing seizure robots, Flash!
5038609	5045395	And then it was kind of hard to see your arrows, so... They also need to put in, like, super random mode, like they have in 7ix Guitar Freaks.
5045768	5073179	where like in normal shuffle mode like all the up arrows become something like left down or right but you can have them so all the arrows are completely random so they'd still appear in the same place but they'd all be completely random and not appear in any order and figure out some way to shuffle double steps because I'm just sick of being able to only play it on regular or play it on mirror and really that's just the same yeah yes
5075106	5092861	I had a dumb idea once, because I'm terrible at freestyling, so I always thought it would be so cool if they put a screen on the back of DDR so that you could turn around and not fuck up.
5093305	5121561	Because I remember when I first played Only You You're right, that is dumb Yeah, and I'm going to kick you Like, I turned around, and I tried to turn around again And I totally messed up because, you know, I don't know how to freestyle Well, that's part of freestyling, is learning how to turn around Now, I know you have issues with Mirror, but I fucking hate Mirror Mirror is the devil Okay, what I meant was, like, you know, just If you want to turn around and start doing steps or some shit like that, you know, like
5122548	5129093	Because, I don't know, I can't look at a step chart and know what I'm doing because I am a complete retard.
5129974	5132736	So you're saying that they should make a freestyle for dummies machine?
5133017	5134818	Yes, yes, exactly, yeah.
5134958	5135599	DDR autistic mix.
5135679	5138181	It's freestyle DDR or some shit like that.
5138261	5139722	I guess that's a possibility.
5139742	5140683	It would be expensive.
5140983	5144726	Yeah, the thing is, I don't know how they would be able to pull that off.
5144766	5149289	Like, it would block the view of people who'd want to watch anyway, so that'd be kind of pointless.
5149950	5150030	Um...
5150638	5155161	And the bars would obviously pose a problem because some people need bars.
5155661	5161444	Somebody in the back of the room is yelling and you can't hear it over the microphone and suggesting that they just take the bars off the next DDR Mix.
5162145	5164266	There is going to be a tournament coming up in August.
5164326	5169529	I happen to know there's going to be a tournament in Concord at Mountain Mike's that they are taking the bar off the machine for freestyle.
5170009	5171150	That should be pretty cool.
5172131	5174272	We'll have more details on that as they're announced.
5174292	5175853	I'm looking at the chat room here.
5175893	5179715	We've got Joe Mama suggesting that they have each arrow go at a different speed.
5179995	5195359	For like a modifier you can set each arrow to go at a random speed That would be crazy, I don't know, that's almost a little too weird Do you think there's any, besides adding new panels, adding new screens, bigger screens Is there anything Konami could do to the game itself to make it more interesting?
5195699	5198420	Or do they pretty much just have to trash the whole damn thing and start over?
5198480	5202241	Actually I got another idea, kind of similar with ParaPara where you have set routines to do
5202748	5207633	Maybe set something up like have a freestyle mode or something where they actually have a set routine for a song.
5207773	5208534	Freestyle for dummies.
5208955	5212618	Yeah, basically, you know, kind of get ideas or something.
5213299	5214380	White people dancing mode.
5214841	5215301	Exactly.
5215321	5217343	Teaching you how to do country line dancing.
5218024	5242744	I wouldn't imagine this would actually be a new DDR but, you know, they've got Parapara, they have DDR they should do something that combines the both together where you have like maybe a sensitive panel beneath you plus the sensors above so it's not just where you wave your hands or where you're stepping but you are doing everything and you memorize their dances or you just have to be in the right place at the right time.
5243165	5245927	You know, I was thinking this might sound kind of
5246317	5249752	I don't know if I had explained it right, but I was thinking maybe they'd add like mini panels.
5250559	5253040	Maybe where you could do like little hand plants and stuff, you know.
5253400	5258241	Maybe they could have like the floor, little moles would come up out of the floor and you could step on them with your feet.
5258301	5259961	Maybe my dead spider stomp.
5260242	5261922	No, you know, maybe that should be it.
5261962	5264283	Maybe they should just make the whole thing like a... You know what?
5264503	5268144	The hell with DDR, we want spider stomp 2DX.
5268304	5268884	How's that sound?
5269144	5270764	No, no, no.
5270824	5277266	How about they just get rid of actual panels and they just make the whole pad pressure sensitive?
5278410	5279511	So, pressure sensitive?
5279531	5280072	That would be interesting.
5280092	5284335	Yeah, and then, like, the whole thing would be just one huge panel, and then, yeah.
5284375	5284735	One huge panel.
5284755	5285375	That would be interesting.
5285415	5288858	And then you could kind of freestyle that way, and they can put arrows wherever they want.
5288898	5291860	It would be like Saturday Night Fever, where you got the light-up dance floor.
5291880	5294101	Wouldn't that be cool?
5294202	5295723	You can suggest, like, John Travolta.
5295903	5296964	I'm going to be somewhere else.
5298725	5299285	More thoughts.
5299305	5300286	That is my two cents.
5301251	5304654	I was thinking maybe Konami should just give us all free machines.
5305115	5306075	Yeah, I'd like that.
5306736	5307236	That'd be great.
5307256	5307877	Do you hear us, Konami?
5307897	5308257	Hook us up.
5308417	5310479	Thank you, Konami, if you're here listening, which I doubt you are.
5310499	5310959	Konami, I love you.
5310979	5311460	Give me a machine.
5312160	5314582	On that note, I think it's time to go into another break here.
5316144	5318486	We're going to go listen to a request right now.
5318526	5322069	We're going to listen to some Jerry Hallowell with It's Rainin' Men.
5322089	5324411	This is a request, by the way, from the chat room.
5324491	5325331	Orange Lounge.
5326472	5339791	which you can visit us on irc.eggheads.org and visit our website as well as http://orangelounge.sky.cx In the meantime, this is for Dark Tetsuya in the chat room.
5339992	5341374	Some Jerry Halliwell from Max 2.
5341414	5341894	Here you go.
5418368	5423550	Waymen, Waymen, Waymen It's time to scream it!
5423630	5424451	It's time to scream it!
5449501	5454003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5466302	5467023	and many more.
5543349	5544406	Thank you for watching!
5596710	5600438	But I guess that's the way to let you know I'm here
5637093	5638095	Thank you for watching!
5703478	5712705	I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
5737053	5740816	Bye-bye, baby balloon.
5740856	5744038	Bye-bye, baby balloon.
5746520	5748281	Bitch, get a new song.
5748921	5751363	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
5751403	5753484	That's right, get a new damn song, lady.
5754025	5757207	Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the very first show.
5757707	5758828	About 8.36.
5758908	5760729	We're taking this show two hours, by the way.
5760749	5761890	We're going to go to 9 o'clock with this.
5762290	5764992	We think if the show is successful in the future, we'll try three hours, but...
5765792	5774780	Actually, this is kind of an interesting situation because my co-host Jamie, the lovely Jamie Summers, is going to be gone for the next two shows.
5775180	5787631	Hey, I'm going to be in San Diego next weekend and then I'm going to Anime Expo where I have enlisted aid to do interviews with several of the people there in cosplays and general views and crap.
5787731	5790692	And that's one thing we're going to bring you on future episodes of Orange Lounge.
5790732	5792252	We want to do interviews.
5792672	5801134	Unfortunately, we were going to be taking a trip yesterday over to Sunnyvale because we knew a lot of people were going to be convening there and we wanted to get some interviews with your favorite Bay Area personalities.
5801574	5806015	But unfortunately, we weren't able to get out there because I had a job to do.
5806035	5808616	I got work, so we couldn't make it out there.
5808636	5810356	But we're going to try in future weeks to get out there.
5810376	5812977	And if you have any event in NorCal that you'd like us to come cover...
5813937	5818979	Drop us an email, orangeloungeradio, that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll try and make it.
5820039	5826481	Even SoCal events we'll consider, but pretty much anything further away than that, we don't really have a travel budget to accommodate yet.
5826801	5829522	But if you want to give us money, we'll definitely think about it.
5829782	5830622	Money is good.
5830902	5832062	Money is always wonderful.
5832102	5834483	Money facilitates going places and doing things.
5837308	5837689	All right.
5838069	5839571	We do have some new subject matter.
5839831	5840512	Okay.
5841073	5853668	The last song we played just before coming out of that break was LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix with Overblast, which is something brand new in the new USA DDR Max that's going to be released.
5854389	5856051	You remember the release date on that, Jamie?
5856071	5856291	No.
5857245	5862310	I think they said they were going to do it in October.
5862370	5862631	November.
5864252	5877245	I don't know about you guys, I kind of had a hunch that this is what was going to happen at E3, is that they were kind of keeping it a secret that there was going to be a new DDR release in the USA, and it turned out to be that they are going to release Max in the USA, except it's not just the same song list.
5878306	5886074	It's going to be some old songs, like Brilliant to You, Orchestral Groove is in it, and AM3P I believe is returning as well.
5886355	5893262	One of my friends who is not into Beimani, he was kind enough to videotape some of the game for me while he was at E3.
5894864	5898488	The songs that I saw being played, I remember definitely that one of them was Insertion.
5900509	5902409	He said that it looked very clean.
5902469	5903850	He was very impressed with it.
5903890	5906611	He got to hear a little bit of some talk about it.
5906631	5913293	And on the tape it sounded like everybody's favorite Konami rep, Jason Enos, in the background giving some information.
5913433	5920835	If I can find the tape, I'll definitely make sure that I have the segment encoded so that everybody can see it or try to do something like that for everyone.
5920855	5922276	Maybe that's something we can put up on our website.
5922296	5922956	That would be pretty cool.
5923676	5926458	But it's kind of old stuff and there's going to be new stuff.
5927139	5931962	And something that is going to be new is 20 new tracks to the USA.
5932042	5933804	Something that has not been on any Japanese release.
5934264	5938627	That's one of those songs right there we just played for you, Overblast, from Beatmania 5th Mix.
5938647	5941309	It's going to be a song in DDR Max with steps and all that fun stuff.
5941970	5947293	And we've been promised that we're going to have some licensed songs in the new DDR.
5948860	5949541	Let's hope so.
5949861	5954346	So, hopefully no more crappy remixes of AM3P.
5954726	5956668	Hey, I like the remix of AM3P.
5956708	5957089	You do?
5957189	5960412	Well, the one in Max 2 is okay, but... I like all of the remixes of AM3P.
5960432	5961654	I don't like the Canomics one.
5961694	5963896	I don't like the remix of Superstar, but that's me.
5967742	5969823	But anyways, Overblast.
5969983	5973584	That song, eh, I could think that you picked a better one.
5973604	5975404	Everybody's entitled to an opinion.
5975424	5980586	Yeah, my opinion on this is that that song sucks ass, and I wish that they had picked a better song.
5980986	5984987	I mean, out of all the beat mania songs in the world, why the hell do you pick that song?
5985107	5986967	Seriously, that song sucks ass.
5987327	5992649	Pick, like, The Fall, I mean, pick, uh, Nopia, I mean, there's a bunch of songs.
5992889	5995950	Oh, hell, why not 321 Stars or something like that?
5996470	5996690	Just...
5997663	5998724	Not that song.
5999084	6002067	But hey, there's still 19 other songs that can be on there.
6002487	6004989	So I still have my hopes up for this.
6005269	6006790	So hopefully you'll be pleased.
6006810	6008932	They say there's licensed songs that are going to be in it.
6009132	6016037	And that would be pretty cool if they went back and took some old school 80s songs or old 90s songs or even some current stuff and made it popular.
6016358	6018679	Just as long as it's not Britney Spears or some of that new top 40 crap.
6018699	6021622	Let's be glad that Britney Spears is working with Metro and not Konami.
6022202	6022542	There you go.
6022562	6025424	So no Britney Spears is likely in the new Max USA, which is nice.
6025824	6030186	Which means no Jive Record artists will be on Max USA, which pretty much eliminates all the top 40.
6030267	6031527	And there was much rejoicing.
6031667	6032288	Yay.
6032588	6035549	And no remixes of Let Them Move.
6035970	6036650	God, no.
6036810	6040993	It actually has been promised on one of those message boards.
6041193	6045275	It was promised that there's no Let Them Move in any way, shape, or form.
6046736	6072635	Finally, Konami comes to a good decision, hooray for them So we'll keep bringing you news on Max USA as we hear it Because it's going to be a big freaking deal At least for us Because they all say that DDR is dying in Japan I don't know if there's any truth to that We're not in Japan, so we don't really know if it's dying or not But that's what people are saying So we'll see Maybe it's dying there, but it's going to be big here So maybe they'll start focusing their efforts on what's starting to become a fad here
6073335	6088056	I would actually like, you know, in the whole respect that we're getting this Max USA, I would like to actually, I'm probably not listening, but I would still like to give a big kudos to Jason Enos of Konami of America for all of the hard work that's been put into us getting these games.
6089298	6091159	and anybody that happened to contribute.
6091279	6093822	I know he's kind of the contact person.
6093862	6097045	He's the one that lurks on all the DDR boards and stuff, letting us know what's going on.
6097065	6100228	But anybody that happens to be involved with that whole process deserves some thank you.
6100468	6104592	Whoever woke up over there and said, let's bring DDR to the U.S.
6104652	6107956	and let's bring them something new, not just recycled crap that they've already imported.
6108616	6111018	Because you know Konami's got to know about all these import machines.
6111058	6116941	That's one thing that's completely boggled me, is you've got all these Max 2 machines popping up everywhere.
6117001	6122144	It's the new thing, which is great, because Max 2's the best mix they've done in a long, long time, I would say.
6122364	6123565	Most people wouldn't argue with me there.
6124886	6133891	But, yet Konami doesn't seem to be... They have that, you know, this message is illegal for use outside of Japan message that comes up on the screen, but yet they're not really doing anything about it.
6134572	6136333	All these Max 2 machines are still sitting there, so...
6137253	6145838	Well, we're not seeing a new release, at least that I've heard of, or that, you know, as far as an arcade release, I haven't seen any new releases come through.
6146378	6163307	I'm not sure exactly the reasoning behind that, but, you know, if they're not minding us getting those imports or they're not actively trying to stop it, let's not bring that up and not, you know... It's very interesting to see that we're actually getting a brand new, you know, actually it doesn't look like something recycled, as Rob was putting it,
6164537	6166298	And actually, it's looking like they're putting time in it.
6166378	6171819	I mean, adding features like, you know, the .5 speed and other things like that, it looks pretty good.
6171859	6173899	Although, .5's kind of a weak feature.
6173959	6182821	It's not really... How many people are going to... Outside of Max 300, which is, in my mind, it's kind of a crutch, if you're going to use .5 speed to beat Max 300.
6182861	6182961	What...
6186782	6188323	What is the use of 0.5?
6188403	6188743	I don't know.
6188984	6190565	Is it just to make things challenging, you think?
6190665	6192406	I think it's to make things more challenging.
6192426	6197529	One of the other things I was looking at is hopefully this won't be as buggy as Chronomix was.
6197869	6209857	I mean, yeah, I have problems with the fact that you can't take the edits off there, put them on Japanese machines because, you know, they do have region coding inside the actual edits also, which kind of sucked ass.
6210117	6211878	Hopefully they'll fix that this time around.
6212559	6213920	Also, it's very interesting that...
6214720	6220004	In Europe, they're getting Euromax, which is the brand new Euromix there, which is awesome.
6220145	6222246	I wish we could get some of their songs over here.
6222346	6223547	I wish, yeah.
6223727	6224408	That would be neat.
6224468	6229752	Now, maybe this is Konami's little trick, is that they're going to actually take those songs they put in Euromix and give them to us.
6229772	6233475	Well, what's interesting, though, is Euromax, they're also getting a machine for that.
6233595	6238078	So maybe we can be looking forward to DDR USA Max also.
6238098	6238599	That would be nice.
6238759	6239460	That would be very nice.
6240300	6247908	Um, something that's being suggested in the chat room, a use for .5, imagine my summer love maniac on .5 flat.
6248949	6250010	That sounds like fun.
6250211	6257438	Yeah, so, stealth, that kind of eliminates, that eliminates, oh, okay, we'll stop.
6257859	6260181	It's effectively stealth, what we're hearing from the back of the room.
6261543	6262544	Interesting suggestion there.
6264148	6270929	So, I don't know when we're going to hear more news on Max USA, but we'll give that to you as soon as we hear any more information on that.
6271410	6276571	One thing we have been hearing little bits and pieces about, it's kind of a surprise to most people, was DDR PC.
6277491	6280372	We're not talking about the politically correct version of DDR with the heroin needles removed.
6280632	6283292	We're talking about DDR for the personal computer on IBM.
6283632	6284812	Have you heard about this at all?
6284892	6285473	Yes, I have.
6285593	6288293	It's actually exclusive to friesandoutposts.com.
6288313	6289073	You can go buy it there.
6289093	6291594	It's basically like Forth Mix on a PC.
6292708	6294730	You've got 40 characters you can choose from.
6294750	6298374	They're going to have more that you can actually download off their website at some point or another.
6299034	6300516	Right now it's been kind of iffy.
6300536	6304420	They've been having it available, then coming soon, available, coming soon.
6304460	6307303	So I think they're having a little bit of trouble getting the actual product out there.
6307323	6308484	They're falling short on that.
6308985	6313930	As far as the song list goes, you only have a few more that actually aren't available in any of the U.S.
6314010	6314451	versions.
6314875	6317696	But pretty much it's just a rehash of 4th Mix all over again.
6317896	6325359	Actually, I was promised to be able to try this out pretty soon, so I'll be able to maybe give a review on that.
6325459	6326599	That'll be nice, next week maybe.
6326759	6334982	But one of the features that was pretty interesting with this one was the fact that they're adding internet ranking, just like 4th Mix and all the other Japanese releases had.
6335482	6336722	So this is pretty good.
6336742	6341704	I don't know how well it's working out, though, because you have people playing on keyboards and you have people playing on pads.
6342304	6343905	So, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of...
6345199	6348480	You know, inflating of people's actual ability on there.
6349000	6351801	But it looks pretty good if you haven't had any home versions.
6351921	6357443	I wonder if there's some kind of switch that would be able to show, hey, this person played on the pad or this person played on the keyboard.
6357884	6361985	But even then, any hacker could probably wire a switch that would look like a pad.
6362045	6366006	Well, actually, no, they do have such a thing in Dance with Intensity.
6366046	6370288	They have it where it actually detects whether it's keyboard or playing with controller.
6370368	6371568	But no, still...
6373309	6373569	Probably.
6373790	6378674	If they just did a port of the PlayStation version, they probably didn't bother to go that far with it.
6379295	6382938	But one thing, I remember before the break, Dave was out here talking about Fry's.
6383899	6390465	And I know a lot of people on the West Coast probably haven't seen this because they don't have Fry's Electronics outside of California too much.
6391866	6393687	They've got this really interesting setup for DDR.
6393707	6395869	Have any of you guys been over to Fry's and seen their DDR setup?
6395889	6404576	They've got the two BADs on the ground, and Fry's is on a concrete floor, at least the one we go to here in Sacramento has a concrete floor on it, so it makes it pretty good to dance on.
6404636	6405857	It kind of feels like the arcade BAD.
6406577	6409760	And then they've got like a big screen TV with DDR economics going on it.
6409840	6413463	And every time I've gone into Fry's, I don't play DDR at Fry's.
6413543	6414503	It's just kind of weird.
6414563	6416545	I don't want to be stared at by all those weird people.
6416705	6417806	I'm not the only one doing that.
6418226	6424371	I constantly see little kids in there playing on the thing, and those things, the pads and games sell.
6424451	6430236	It seems like I always seem to look over, and there's one set of parents, at least one set of parents looking at the games, thinking about buying them.
6430816	6432077	So Fry's has kind of been pushing it.
6432477	6435460	But people really, really, really want to go to GameStop.
6436670	6441474	Let's see, and I'd like to respond to Joe Mama in the chatroom about editing images and posting them.
6441615	6451743	Actually, they have passwords, and basically it's just a long string of letters and numbers that they give you when you, you know, finish your songs to post up for the internet rankings.
6451763	6457689	It doesn't have anything to do with screen captures or anything like that, so there's really no way to cheat as far as photoshopping goes.
6458209	6463174	But I mean, I'm sure there's ways you could probably find to, you know, crack the passwords and all that kind of thing.
6463314	6468438	Just like, it sounds like it was going to be just like the ranking for 4th Mix and 5th Mix and Max 2.
6469039	6471201	Everything had on it where you had the long passwords.
6471261	6473343	So it's pretty much a lifted system from that.
6473663	6476085	I wonder if it matches any other game, though.
6476145	6481049	Like, if you were to play a song on another mix, it gives you the same code that... You know, that does remind me...
6481870	6489134	Someone, I believe, we should make it a part to actually post somewhere the actual, there is internet ranking in Max, too.
6489414	6490795	A lot of people don't know about it.
6491035	6497358	If you play three songs, certain songs in a row, you'll actually get a password and stuff that you can post on the internet ranking site.
6497498	6499339	Not many people know that that's actually out there.
6499679	6500740	Hmm, interesting.
6501780	6505002	Perhaps we might need to make this a future contest or something, you know?
6507608	6508429	I don't know about that.
6508449	6518398	I'm sure Japanese and people from the barrier are probably dominating that internet ranking list there, but we could give it a try.
6518598	6519839	There's also the Oni ranking.
6519879	6525584	I know that there is, somewhere on Team Guilo's page, there has been a page for the Oni ranking.
6526325	6534172	Yeah, they went to the effort to translate the internet ranking page into English, so a big shout out to them for doing that, because that's a good favor to the whole community there.
6535322	6550435	Speaking of the community, we'd like to make a mention that if ever, you know, whenever we're not hosting our show live, you can also check out a lot of the community action for the Sac Baymani forums located at www.sacbaymani.com.
6550455	6553578	That's S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I.com.
6554198	6554498	DarkSakura.com
6575831	6578656	I'm going to take a really quick break here and then we're going to come back and wrap things up.
6578756	6581942	So I'm going to do a set of a couple 2DX songs and then we'll come right back.
6581982	6584707	We'll start it off with Rizlam here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6601753	6602595	Thank you for watching!
6632943	6633885	Thank you for watching!
6799713	6801414	Where's my fan when I need it?
6801434	6802875	I wanted to do the Tran Dance.
6803275	6803995	The Tran Dance.
6804516	6806177	The Starmine Tran Dance.
6806197	6809238	That's actually the way I freestyle in 2DX.
6809638	6812520	There's a little break in Starmine and I'll do a little spinny arm thing.
6812560	6815522	Anyway, that was Ryu with Starmine.
6815562	6817403	Before that, Rick with Rizlam.
6818423	6819424	from 2DX.
6819704	6823325	And right now, they've been playing 2DX all night here in the broadcast room.
6823365	6824826	They're playing, what is this, Love Will?
6825306	6826247	That's a great 2DX song.
6826267	6827087	They'll play that next week.
6827247	6828247	That's old school 2DX.
6828307	6829068	Old school 2DX.
6830168	6832089	We're getting ready to wrap up the show here, our first show.
6832109	6834250	I'd like to thank everybody here for listening tonight.
6834470	6835911	Thank you so much for listening to our first show.
6835931	6838532	You're listening to a little piece of Bomani history, I'd like to thank.
6838932	6840394	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6859031	6861113	Right before, right when we came back from the last segment.
6861373	6863475	But Jamie, you're going to be gone for a couple weeks now.
6863535	6866998	You're the co-host of the show, yet you're already abandoning us, but with good reason.
6867278	6877446	I go to AX every year, and I'm actually heading down a week early to go to San Diego to see some friends and to hunt down our little Youth Coalition friend with a chainsaw.
6877566	6883371	I mean, with a recorder so I can maybe get an interview if the door's not slammed in my face.
6883391	6883591	Right.
6884591	6887453	But really, I'm going to be at Anime Expo.
6887473	6888814	I'm going to have recorders with me.
6889314	6893376	So all of you people who are going to be there, watch out for the girl with the wings.
6894457	6895477	Yes, I will be in costume.
6895497	6895877	I've seen cosplay.
6895937	6896418	It's great.
6897118	6898859	Jamie's cosplay costume is something else for this.
6899190	6906178	I will be either in costume as Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary or Baiken from Guilty Gear X or Leona from King of Fighters.
6906918	6912625	So watch out for the short girl in the costume with the big black wings and the face paint.
6912865	6916209	Our website was finished today and your picture's on it so they can find it there.
6917230	6917430	Yes.
6918031	6918391	Exactly.
6919292	6920013	But the issue is...
6921048	6924390	We're still doing the show every week, so we're going to have an open seat.
6924930	6927472	So, what do you think I should do about this predicament we're in?
6927492	6928953	Should I have them all fight over it?
6929033	6931614	Should I make them all play 2DX to see who wins?
6931694	6934216	You could do like the clown car thing and pile them all in.
6934416	6934656	What?
6934956	6936657	You could do the clown car thing and pile them all in.
6936858	6938118	I could make them all sit in the big chair.
6938138	6944082	The seat is really cushy, and I think that we should just put caution tape around it, and people have to caution drop to get in.
6944702	6945142	Yeah.
6945403	6947244	Do Trippie L.
6948755	6949415	Ooh, there we go.
6949455	6950556	We could do elimination.
6951476	6952516	We could trivia battle.
6952616	6954377	We could do Bomani Survivor.
6956637	6959578	But the seat will be filled by a random individual.
6960118	6964760	But it will be temporarily filled because I don't let up my spot easily.
6965440	6967020	Maybe we'll do Bomani Pop Idol.
6967040	6967561	How's that sound?
6969321	6969981	You're awful.
6970061	6970661	Be quiet.
6971082	6972302	You don't know what you're talking about.
6973462	6974423	What do you mean?
6974463	6976584	You're not coming to Hollywood, you little bitch.
6976744	6977964	You are the weakest link?
6978845	6979065	Fuck off.
6979085	6979625	Something like that.
6979645	6981846	It's pretty much a cross between the weakest link and Star Search.
6981966	6984768	And this is why I don't watch TV anymore.
6984808	6988670	Yeah, we should do karaoke to see who stays on.
6988990	6994433	I think maybe what we'll do is we'll just come back next week and we'll kind of surprise everybody with who we're going to have.
6994513	6996214	Maybe we'll talk about it during the week.
6997105	7001808	I don't know, unless you have any... We will have a lovely surprise waiting for the crowd next week.
7002608	7003949	Are you sure?
7004249	7005130	No karaoke?
7006810	7007511	And no karaoke?
7007791	7008752	Maybe we'll do karaoke.
7009372	7012734	Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you.
7013494	7014535	Irene Moss, anyway.
7015435	7016436	Oh, no I didn't.
7017176	7020078	Or we could just settle this the good old D&D way, where's my dice?
7021205	7021725	Uh-oh.
7021985	7023146	Somebody chatbot!
7023426	7025447	I know all of you know what D&D means, too.
7026487	7028588	Because we're all a bunch of dorks.
7028628	7030788	You sacrifice chickens by the week.
7031148	7031689	How about this?
7031909	7033529	How about we pick a number between 1 and 6.
7033629	7035290	Okay, everyone picks a number.
7035530	7036410	Don't say it on the air.
7036950	7040712	And then we'll have someone that's in our chatroom type a random number between 1 and 6.
7041832	7043632	And that'll be who hosts, since we all have a dice.
7046519	7047720	Dude, I got an 18 strength.
7047740	7048460	I'm going to own you all.
7049521	7050442	Six different numbers.
7057286	7073217	And as we have a moment of silence to decide, since the microphone can't pick up the people in the background, I think that we will have a random guest next week, and we will surprise our beautiful, lovely listeners, who we all love very much and are trying not to bore to death.
7073297	7075839	And if worse comes to worse, we'll just pass the headset around.
7075859	7077501	We'll let everybody sit in the chair for a segment.
7077521	7078562	Does that sound like a fair option?
7078642	7080323	Oh, so now you're pimping out my chair.
7080644	7081704	Yeah, we'll pimp out the chair.
7082105	7085207	So the new co-host for next week will be the Bomani pimp.
7085228	7085728	How's that sound?
7085748	7086469	They'll be the whore.
7086829	7088290	We've got to be the pimp to pimp out the chair.
7088871	7089511	They'll be our whore.
7089571	7091193	Oh, so they'll be the Bomani whores.
7092580	7092900	That's true.
7093100	7094521	You can get ejected out of the chair.
7094581	7095442	Say something stupid.
7095482	7095962	Bail!
7095982	7096803	And you're out of the chair.
7096823	7101205	I have a button with a spring, and if you piss me off... It'd be like Russian Roulette.
7101425	7102466	They'll fall through the floor.
7106508	7107069	Russian Roulette.
7107089	7109470	It would be like that MTV show, Remote Control.
7111251	7112372	It'd be like Remote Control.
7112652	7117575	Now, see, there is a sign of being old when you remember when Remote Control was new.
7118504	7120225	That mitten and you're old, if you remember.
7120245	7125147	What was the song they all sang when the person went through the wall?
7132309	7133050	Hey!
7133410	7133970	Party!
7136432	7139174	Anyway, I think we're going to bring this show to a close now.
7139754	7141035	Thank you everybody for listening.
7141055	7143277	Please join us next week again at 7 o'clock.
7143657	7146098	We're going to rebroadcast this show sometime through the week.
7146139	7150481	I just haven't figured out a good time yet, so if there's a part you missed, you can hear it later.
7150922	7156545	But do send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, all one word.
7156986	7160868	And let us know what songs you want to hear through the week.
7163431	7165093	Yeah, all your suggestions and stuff.
7165373	7166795	All your suggestions are belong to us.
7166875	7167315	Exactly.
7167375	7168196	For great justice.
7168757	7170018	Alright, so we're going to end the show now.
7170058	7175425	Thank you to everybody for listening and we will see you next week on the Orange Lounge.
7175445	7176766	Any final thoughts, Jamie?
7179009	7180150	Be excellent to each other.
7180611	7181672	Party on, dude!
