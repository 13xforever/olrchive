00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
You bitch!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Now let me check the disco.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
You one, two, fuck you!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
You have no morals.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
You don't.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun in the scorching case of her face.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hidey ho.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Me too!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Fucker yet?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm working on it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Loser.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Lame!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
On the side of my face.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Breathing.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Grassless.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Heaving grass.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Heaving.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
records.

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
From the state of California and the great nation of the USA on the planet earth it is

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me better as Sky.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
With me, as always, is a lovely co-host who has 12 lovely vanilla cans, might I add.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
It's Dark Sakura, aka Jamie Summers.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Whoo! I have a bill of coke. It's crack.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
This is episode number one for June 23rd, 2002.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
We've got a whole lot of people in the studio.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Say hello, studio!

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Hello!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, there you go.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Any other first things you want to say, Jamie?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Uh, hi.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
That works for me.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
Alrighty then, we'll be right back where we'll be talking about the first show, and lots of other firsts, and whatever the hell else we feel like.

We'll be giving that out for the rest of the show, won't we, Jamie?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh yes, quite often.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Alrighty.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
For the very first great song, I'm going to play something for the Fantasia album.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
This is Vanessa Mae with Destiny.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And it's Vanessa Mae at Freaky Rocks, don't it, Jamie?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Vanessa Mae owns it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Alright, here we go.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
It's my destiny.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Hey!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Hey!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Hey!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Hey!

05:23.000 --> 05:52.920
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you remember then? Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Is this burning, an eternal flame? I believe it's my duty, darling I want you when you see me, you belong to me Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?

05:52.920 --> 05:56.920
And it's burning, an eternal flame

05:56.920 --> 05:59.920
Save a man, sunshine through the rain

05:59.920 --> 06:03.920
Life's so lame, and you can't even see

06:03.920 --> 06:06.920
I don't wanna lose this feeling

06:23.920 --> 06:24.920
Say my name

06:24.920 --> 06:25.920
Let me shine through the rain

06:25.920 --> 06:26.920
I'm on a flight

06:26.920 --> 06:29.920
So long as it ain't somebody's name

06:29.920 --> 06:33.920
I don't know who to see or hate

06:35.920 --> 06:38.920
Don't you lie, just give me your hand

06:38.920 --> 06:41.920
Don't you see, just give my heart to me

06:41.920 --> 06:44.920
Do you know what to say, just give me your hand

06:44.920 --> 06:47.920
Am I only dreaming?

06:47.920 --> 06:49.920
Is this burning?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.920
An eternal flame?

06:52.920 --> 06:54.920
Give me your hand

06:54.920 --> 06:57.920
Don't you see, just give my heart to me

06:57.920 --> 07:09.460
Do you want to have a dream and an eternal Sche Friend?

07:09.460 --> 07:18.580
Do you want to have a dream and an eternal Sche Friend?

07:18.580 --> 07:28.580
And it turns out all right

07:28.580 --> 07:33.580
No, no, nobody knows

07:33.580 --> 07:35.580
No, nobody knows

07:35.580 --> 07:37.580
No, nobody knows

07:37.580 --> 07:39.580
Can't take me

07:39.580 --> 07:45.580
No, no, nobody knows

07:45.580 --> 07:52.580
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, can't take me

07:52.580 --> 07:54.580
Goodbye, baby balloon

07:58.580 --> 08:00.580
Goodbye, bye, baby balloon

08:02.580 --> 08:04.580
Bitch, get a new song!

08:04.580 --> 08:07.580
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

08:07.580 --> 08:09.580
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

08:09.580 --> 08:12.580
Here we are live on our very first broadcast

08:12.580 --> 08:13.580
How's it feel, Jamie?

08:13.580 --> 08:21.020
me? It feels like burning! My thoughts exactly. So, I guess we kind of have to explain a little

08:21.020 --> 08:25.420
bit about the history of Orange Lounge Radio, and this is kind of an idea that Jamie and

08:25.420 --> 08:33.380
I have had going on for a long, long time. Long, long, long time. Whose idea was it anyway?

08:33.380 --> 08:38.100
It was Brad's idea. He just claimed it. It was all Brad's idea. It's your fault. So if

08:38.100 --> 08:42.660
you want to blame somebody for this talk show, Trainwreck, just blame Brad. How's that sound?

08:42.660 --> 08:54.660
I think the idea came to us, what, probably back in January? When was the first time you guessed it on the other show, Under Sedation Live, that we participated in?

08:54.660 --> 08:57.660
That was in January or so, wasn't it? I know it was this year.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.660
I think it was probably back in January.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.660
It was after I got my new computer, so that had to have been in January.

09:02.660 --> 09:07.900
When Jamie was on the first Undersedation Live that she was on, which is another show

09:07.900 --> 09:15.440
that I co-host, you can visit that website at http://undersedationlive.org, or it's actually

09:15.440 --> 09:21.980
one of our friends on the Live 365 site, so if you go to Live 365 and take a look at our

09:21.980 --> 09:25.220
fellow broadcasters, we have the Undersedation Live listed there, and that's the show that

09:25.220 --> 09:27.180
I co-host on Saturday night.

09:27.180 --> 09:32.180
And I also like to say, if Travis happens to be out there listening tonight, I really

09:32.180 --> 09:38.580
appreciate all the help, and this drink's for you. There you go. That relates to last

09:38.580 --> 09:42.380
night's show, don't worry about it.

09:42.380 --> 09:46.940
So, probably back when Jamie hosted this show in January, we thought, you know, we oughta

09:46.940 --> 09:55.540
do a Bamani talk thing for Bamani. Just not, you know, just, uh, Under Station Life kind

09:55.540 --> 10:01.900
of was born of the Rocky Horror genre, because we always used to go to Rocky Horror every

10:01.900 --> 10:06.760
Friday, Saturday night, whatever, and then this is kind of our new addiction as

10:06.760 --> 10:10.240
Bamani because we don't really have Rocky Horror in Sacramento anymore, so we

10:10.240 --> 10:14.600
thought, hell, we'll do a show about Bamani. So, but The Understation Live kind of, it

10:14.600 --> 10:18.240
took the Rocky thing, it kind of grew out of that, I don't know, it still kind of

10:18.240 --> 10:22.000
relates to Rocky in a way, but it's kind of its own, its own child now, and we

10:22.000 --> 10:25.240
thought we'd see what kind of bastard son we get out of this idea, the Bamani

10:25.240 --> 10:30.280
show. Getting some kind of Siamese twin joined the head sort of mutant freak.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.280
week. But hey, we're cool that way.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.280
You're just evil, aren't you?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.280
Oh yes, I am pure evil.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.280
And you know what, people like me that way so

10:38.280 --> 10:39.280
they can shut up.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.280
So we've got a lot of people here in the studio tonight

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
and we've got this interesting setup as we got

10:43.280 --> 10:45.280
in the house. We've got two game rooms

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
going. We've got one in the back and if you look

10:47.280 --> 10:49.280
at the webcam on our website,

10:49.280 --> 10:51.280
http colon slash slash

10:51.280 --> 10:53.280
orangelounge.sky.cx

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
You can see on the webcam there's

10:55.280 --> 10:57.280
some people, I think they're playing Max in there right now

10:57.280 --> 10:59.280
I don't know. I think so. In the other room.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.600
here we've got keys pounding which you can probably hear because we've got Brad in here

11:02.600 --> 11:07.640
playing some 2DX. Yell something to the studio audio or the people out at home, Brad.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.280
LED on view. He said LED on view if you can hear that.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.880
Playing the theme of Dungeon J. He's playing the theme of Dungeon J over there.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.280
He's playing the theme of Dungeon J. Thank you, Irene. Yes, he is playing the theme

11:19.280 --> 11:28.920
of Dungeon J. Anyways, I thought we'd stay here since this is our first show. Let's talk

11:28.920 --> 11:35.920
about DDR, the first experiences of DDR, 2DX, BeatMania, whatever it is, because that's

11:36.280 --> 11:43.280
a long time ago for some of us, especially Jamie. Speaking of firsts, since it is the

11:47.920 --> 11:52.080
first show, we are kind of expecting that there's going to be a lot of issues tonight,

11:52.080 --> 11:54.480
so please bear with us throughout all the technical difficulties and everything else

11:54.480 --> 11:57.160
going on. We have the communal microphone over here on the fireplace. We have the communal

11:57.160 --> 12:01.280
microphone that everybody's going to have to talk into, which Irene has pretty much

12:01.280 --> 12:04.620
parked herself near, so I think we'll know who we'll be hearing from most of the night

12:04.620 --> 12:10.360
over there. First experience is with Bamani, because it's kind of something you see once,

12:10.360 --> 12:15.040
you play it once, and then you're pretty much stuck with it for the rest of your life, especially

12:15.040 --> 12:18.200
if you're listening to this program. If you've actually gone out of your way to tune into

12:18.200 --> 12:25.160
a Bamani-focused radio program, you're obviously a very ill person who's come down with a Bamani

12:25.160 --> 12:26.160
flu.

12:26.160 --> 12:37.380
come to my threats no no no they're not dorks are you so Jamie what was your

12:37.380 --> 12:40.860
very first the money experience was the first time yeah I know you out of

12:40.860 --> 12:44.160
probably most people here I'm not sure cuz we haven't really compared everybody's

12:44.160 --> 12:47.100
notes yet now most people here you were probably the very first person to play

12:47.100 --> 12:54.900
DDR and all that to go way back in time let's go to 1999 around of February or

12:54.900 --> 12:56.940
march at first heard of the media

12:56.940 --> 12:59.220
and thought though that was kind of dorky

12:59.220 --> 13:02.980
and i actually had beat me in ninety eight on my computer so that was my

13:02.980 --> 13:05.300
ever first meeting in they have

13:05.300 --> 13:08.540
how many of us started with bm ninety-eight region and

13:08.540 --> 13:10.760
that'd be me and brad anyway

13:10.760 --> 13:14.780
uh... i went to an expo i had heard of the institution said that it looks

13:14.780 --> 13:15.740
stupid

13:15.740 --> 13:17.340
i'm gonna play best to move

13:17.340 --> 13:21.540
so i was in the best to move to turn it in a x nineteen ninety nine

13:21.540 --> 13:25.780
spent like an hour owning everybody before i got a faulty controller

13:25.780 --> 13:29.640
and uh... so whenever it was a key to see because i heard

13:29.640 --> 13:31.700
uh... shake your booty playing

13:31.700 --> 13:33.960
and it was your second mix

13:33.960 --> 13:38.020
so that was my first tdr i didn't actually really play it and then

13:38.020 --> 13:39.460
i hit uh...

13:39.460 --> 13:41.760
makes two thousand

13:41.760 --> 13:45.220
and i saw the first one on playstation and got hooked and i borrowed my

13:45.220 --> 13:46.300
friend's game

13:46.300 --> 13:48.120
couldn't pass butterfly

13:48.120 --> 13:52.380
I was asleep one night, woke up the next morning, and just, like, passed a butterfly at random.

13:52.380 --> 13:57.980
So I didn't see my first DDR machine until AX2000. It was the third mix. It was two dollars

13:57.980 --> 14:03.840
a game, and, well, I dished out two dollars a game, slept in the room, and there went

14:03.840 --> 14:05.840
my addiction.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.240
And I started off with the Dreamcast, and nobody can say anything. Sega owns.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
Not anymore.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.240
Don't bite me.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.960
Hey, CIG is making games for the game crew.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.240
third-party stuff is is looking pretty good so I got to give them some credit

14:20.240 --> 14:25.240
give them lots of credit and actually DDR Club on the Dreamcast is much better

14:25.240 --> 14:27.680
than the PlayStation version because they had to they had to split the

14:27.680 --> 14:31.920
PlayStation version into two two CDs and that kind of sucks but on Dreamcast it's

14:31.920 --> 14:37.280
all in one nice shiny little package my first DDR experience was I and funny

14:37.280 --> 14:41.400
enough you know this this show that this is kind of spun off of is a Rocky Horror

14:41.400 --> 14:45.800
theme show I actually first discovered DDR at a Rocky Horror convention and

14:45.800 --> 14:48.800
and this was, hell, I don't even know, I think it was 2000.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.520
I'm getting so old. I think in October of 2000,

14:52.520 --> 14:55.560
we were at a convention in Las Vegas

14:55.560 --> 14:58.800
at the Hard Rock Hotel, and they were showing the movie Friday

14:58.800 --> 15:03.040
and Saturday night, but we decided, you know what, once a week's enough, so we're

15:03.040 --> 15:04.080
not going to go Friday night.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.280
We're just going to go out to the arcade and we're just going to play games, because that's what we want to do.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.360
And there was one of those big dancing machines with the flashing seizure lights,

15:12.360 --> 15:15.720
and we all wanted to play it. That was your first night too, wasn't it?

15:15.720 --> 15:22.040
I mean, anything else you wish to add about...

15:22.040 --> 15:25.060
About DDR? Do we play our first game together?

15:25.060 --> 15:26.480
No, I think

15:26.480 --> 15:29.960
it was just me by myself first, because you guys were pussies. Okay, I don't remember.

15:29.960 --> 15:35.200
And you're like, we're white, we can't play this, let the Asian do it first, and then we'll look cool, you know,

15:35.200 --> 15:38.180
after. No, I'm kidding. I don't know.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.820
Yeah, we were at Circus Circus, and what was it, a 1.5?

15:41.820 --> 15:44.000
I was the old U.S.A. machine.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.140
I distinctly remember the song Butterfly.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.140
Shut up!

15:48.140 --> 15:49.140
Shut up!

15:49.140 --> 15:50.140
Everybody played it!

15:50.140 --> 15:53.580
I remember it was the spinning discs that you can choose from instead of the song list.

15:53.580 --> 15:54.820
Yeah, I remember that much.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.140
And we fucking sucked.

15:56.140 --> 15:57.140
We were terrible.

15:57.140 --> 15:58.140
We were like...

15:58.140 --> 16:00.140
I remember passing.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.140
We passed the first song.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.140
Didn't I pass Boom Boom Dollar the first time?

16:04.140 --> 16:09.340
Yeah, you passed the second song and I was like sleeping by then because I failed like

16:09.340 --> 16:11.300
the first three steps.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.480
i would like to take this moment to give Irene an inside joke

16:14.480 --> 16:16.820
and then the maid

16:16.820 --> 16:18.780
that's the best joke ever

16:18.780 --> 16:21.540
shush Brad

16:21.540 --> 16:28.100
oh my god this show is going to suck

16:28.100 --> 16:32.280
so after that we came back home to Sacramento, land of nothingness

16:32.280 --> 16:33.100
and

16:33.100 --> 16:36.740
we thought that was pretty much it, that was the only time we were going to play DDR and then we found that

16:36.740 --> 16:38.620
Roseville Golf Land

16:38.620 --> 16:40.100
ended up getting

16:40.100 --> 16:44.320
its own d r machines sometime and i think

16:44.320 --> 16:48.540
what december of two thousand every covered it being this is a really

16:48.540 --> 16:49.660
u s a mix

16:49.660 --> 16:52.100
and everything toward the end of the summer

16:52.100 --> 16:52.780
because

16:52.780 --> 16:55.480
i've been playing at country club lanes

16:55.480 --> 16:57.160
the evil place

16:57.160 --> 16:58.000
and then

16:58.000 --> 17:02.040
i heard haters u s a machine over at risk of off and went over there and

17:02.040 --> 17:04.860
that's a lot of people

17:04.860 --> 17:07.840
uh... danielle first into her and that brad

17:07.840 --> 17:09.600
and then i did

17:09.600 --> 17:12.660
a bunch of people at milpitas golf land

17:12.660 --> 17:17.280
first-rate ship to find our part with the sacrament strolls yes the sacrament

17:17.280 --> 17:19.720
stills we

17:19.720 --> 17:25.420
we we need a sexy badly bleeding

17:25.420 --> 17:30.720
and we don't die if you're not okay

17:30.720 --> 17:34.020
anyone else in the room care share their first the money story has really

17:34.020 --> 17:35.560
desperate for material right now

17:35.560 --> 17:38.180
because they're going to have this we're never going to fill a two-hour show

17:38.180 --> 17:41.180
We have to prove them wrong, even if we have to bullshit for just two hours.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.180
Uh-oh, he's got the microphone. Everybody run.

17:43.180 --> 17:45.180
Loki, a.k.a. Matt, would like to share a story.

17:45.180 --> 17:48.180
Let's see, my first experience with Bimani.

17:48.180 --> 17:55.180
I'd have to say it started back, I believe it was the year 2000, with Phantomacon.

17:55.180 --> 17:59.180
I saw someone playing a five-key beat me in a second mix.

17:59.180 --> 18:03.180
And, actually, it was really cool.

18:03.180 --> 18:07.180
What song that hooked me was the theme for Metal Gear Solid.

18:07.180 --> 18:14.180
And from there I went and bought everything for Beatmania, played it a couple times, and put it away.

18:14.180 --> 18:23.180
And then next year comes around 2001, and I saw them playing DDR 4th Mix, which was really awesome.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.180
That game I really got into.

18:25.180 --> 18:32.180
And so I actually got a chance to play it the first time in Lake Tahoe, and I found out I had no rhythm whatsoever.

18:32.180 --> 18:37.180
In fact, I sort of looked like Steve Martin in The Jerk.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.180
I just had absolutely...

18:39.180 --> 18:41.180
Now that's an obscure reference no one's ever going to get, but that's okay.

18:41.180 --> 18:44.180
It was just, like, horrible.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.180
It was just very sad.

18:45.180 --> 18:49.180
And unfortunately, I didn't get the clue and get off the machine after one game.

18:49.180 --> 18:54.180
I stayed and played three games with absolutely no rhythm whatsoever.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.180
So then, you know, flash forward back to about a year ago,

18:57.180 --> 19:01.180
I come to find out after I moved from El Dorado Hills to Orangeville

19:01.180 --> 19:08.540
ville that roseville's got you know fourth and a usa machine and i had during the time picked up

19:08.540 --> 19:14.620
also my own home version of fourth and third with two pads and i'd been practicing on pink dinosaur

19:14.620 --> 19:22.620
and lucy nerita oh jesus oh yeah i remember those anyways so then i started playing at roseville

19:23.420 --> 19:28.940
constantly i used to do nine hours a weekend and actually i think i still do about nine hours a

19:28.940 --> 19:29.940
a week.

19:29.940 --> 19:34.340
Excuse me to cut you off for a minute, Brad, Brad, Brad, yeah, that song is banned in this

19:34.340 --> 19:35.340
house.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.780
Do not play 250 BPM in this house.

19:38.780 --> 19:45.540
Everybody in this house has nightmares about that freaking crack baby in the video.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.220
I'm sorry to cut you off, go ahead.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.220
Oh, that's alright.

19:48.220 --> 19:53.140
So yeah, nine hours a week for, you know, a whole year so far.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.580
Alright, woo, yeah, yeah, okay.

19:55.580 --> 20:00.580
Anybody else want to share their first story? Brad, I'd love to hear your story. Come on. Put the controller down. Come on.

20:00.580 --> 20:03.580
Oh! There's somebody. Who's going to walk through the door?

20:03.580 --> 20:06.580
And the doorbell rings. More victims! Ha ha ha!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.580
This is your life.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.580
I know.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
Or this is our show.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
Anyway.

20:13.580 --> 20:19.580
Actually, before we go on to whoever our guest is, I actually would like to make a mention.

20:19.580 --> 20:20.580
Would you? Go for it.

20:20.580 --> 20:33.580
This is just a general shout-out. This goes to DDR Freak Radio, all the other Bimani radio stations out there you guys own and keep doing it because we need to keep Bimani on the air and keep everything alive too.

20:33.580 --> 20:42.580
I agree. We need to keep doing shit like Bimani X Radio, all those other radio stations out there. Who else is broadcasting? I know there's a user on DDR Freak who has their own station.

20:42.580 --> 20:46.380
station. There's probably about 10 different stations. You put the money into live365.com,

20:46.380 --> 20:51.180
you're going to get about 10 different stations that come up. And there's commotion going

20:51.180 --> 20:55.820
on at the door there. Hey, Paul's here. What's up, Paul? We're going to give a shout-out

20:55.820 --> 20:58.980
to all those other Bahmani stations out there, because especially, if you might have heard

20:58.980 --> 21:05.680
this past week, I believe it was Thursday, the new royalty rates for internet radio came

21:05.680 --> 21:12.280
down. And we're going to have to pay seven cents for every song heard by a thousand listeners.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.280
Now, granted, this station will never, ever, ever have a thousand listeners.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.280
We hope.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
We just hope.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
And if it does, we have ways to control that.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
That still sucks.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
I mean, that's way too much.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.280
I mean, what does the RIA think?

21:24.280 --> 21:29.280
We're going to start charging people for when, like, I have a party and there's a DJ here playing music

21:29.280 --> 21:33.280
and I have a hundred people at the party, are they going to come bang down my door and steal my wallet

21:33.280 --> 21:35.280
because I'm playing music for my friends at a party?

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
Well, isn't it retroactive too?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.280
We're just promoting albums here.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.600
I'm sure Konami, since pretty much this whole thing is just, you know, sucking Konami's

21:43.600 --> 21:46.640
cock here, because they're the ones that do all of Bomani games and everything.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.640
Did you say cock?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.640
Yes, I did say cock.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.080
By the way, if you didn't hear the disclaimer at the beginning of the show, it is an adult

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
program.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.440
This whole Bomani thing, I'm sure, since we're pretty much whoring out Bomani, they really

21:55.440 --> 21:58.720
don't give a crap what we're doing, so they probably wouldn't come after us, but still,

21:58.720 --> 22:03.000
for everybody else out there, for all the other shows out there, this is a really, like,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.820
stupid thing that they're trying to do, it's just trying to charge us for every little

22:06.820 --> 22:08.720
thing we do

22:08.720 --> 22:11.640
we're not going to take it

22:11.640 --> 22:16.100
there's two roots to that one of them is greed

22:16.100 --> 22:17.340
number two

22:17.340 --> 22:18.600
it's called

22:18.600 --> 22:22.340
having something crawl up your ass and die

22:22.340 --> 22:25.340
exactly that happened to me tuesday don't even care about people

22:25.340 --> 22:27.580
maybe anal greed

22:27.580 --> 22:29.540
that doesn't sound right

22:29.540 --> 22:30.820
like anal spider

22:30.820 --> 22:37.460
I like anal spider. But anal spider is cool because they do beat Nani as Seth.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.700
That was my anal spider noise.

22:38.700 --> 22:43.140
Let's do that again.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.260
Wow. That's not quite what I remember from the song.

22:46.260 --> 22:48.460
Was it Macho Gang?

22:48.460 --> 22:51.500
You kind of have to get on that face of the...

22:51.500 --> 22:53.540
A petty just stuck to me. Isn't that crazy?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.820
You're going to have to get on that face of...

22:55.820 --> 22:57.820
As Rob goes off on another tangent.

22:57.820 --> 23:00.820
No, it's the dying giraffe sound from the South Park movie.

23:00.820 --> 23:03.820
Hey, what do you mean, boy?

23:03.820 --> 23:06.820
Hey, Paul's here. Paul, say hi.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.820
Paul, say hi.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.820
Hi, everybody.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.820
Give Paul the microphone, because we're talking about...

23:10.820 --> 23:13.820
Let the adults have the show.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.820
Don't make out with the microphone.

23:16.820 --> 23:20.820
In other words, don't perform sexual acts on the microphone.

23:20.820 --> 23:23.820
Since this is the first show of Orange Lounge,

23:23.820 --> 23:25.820
the Monty Talk show that no one says will work,

23:25.820 --> 23:30.660
because there's no way to fill up two hours about talking about the money

23:30.660 --> 23:34.660
believe me if we have gone how many months now of playing the money and

23:34.660 --> 23:38.420
never shutting up about it like uh... afternoon i'm not going to say i don't

23:38.420 --> 23:40.900
have a life outside of the money because

23:40.900 --> 23:44.860
because i don't like to admit it

23:44.860 --> 23:48.580
it's not everything but we can certainly develop two hours of the show

23:48.580 --> 23:52.420
if we spent fifteen minutes on each game alone that was actually ours at two

23:52.420 --> 23:56.420
two hours a week that we can fill. So we're talking about firsts. So we want to know everybody's

23:56.420 --> 23:59.420
first experience with Imani and why they're so addicted.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.420
So tell us how you lost your Imani virginity.

24:00.420 --> 24:03.740
If it's the heroin needles that shoot out when you do a good job or what?

24:03.740 --> 24:07.860
Paul, that was a question for you.

24:07.860 --> 24:08.860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:08.860 --> 24:10.700
Yes, tell us about your first experience.

24:10.700 --> 24:16.740
Um, well, I would just, you know, I started out with DDR and it just led on the other

24:16.740 --> 24:21.940
things, you know? I didn't mean to. I thought I was just going to stick with DDR, but I

24:21.940 --> 24:23.940
I'm so sorry!

24:23.940 --> 24:26.940
I don't know, I came around the corner and I saw Beatmania

24:26.940 --> 24:28.940
I had to try and I couldn't stop

24:28.940 --> 24:30.940
and just let on the other things guitar freaks

24:30.940 --> 24:32.940
Now I have no money

24:32.940 --> 24:33.940
I don't know what I'm going to do

24:33.940 --> 24:35.940
He has to steal the play

24:35.940 --> 24:37.940
Oh my goodness

24:37.940 --> 24:39.940
I can't believe it

24:39.940 --> 24:41.940
Everything's ruined

24:43.940 --> 24:44.940
Smartass

24:44.940 --> 24:46.940
How many doses do you have?

24:46.940 --> 24:48.940
You only have like

24:48.940 --> 24:49.940
Just enough to fill up the show

24:49.940 --> 24:51.940
Anyway.

24:51.940 --> 24:53.940
Give us more! When?

24:53.940 --> 24:55.940
More what he sounds like.

24:55.940 --> 24:58.940
I can fill up two hours with just sound effects. That's not a problem.

25:00.940 --> 25:03.940
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Here's a little number I tossed off recently at the Caribbean.

25:03.940 --> 25:04.940
I'm not singing with it this time.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.940
Doesn't it all be nice to have a penis?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.940
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dog?

25:10.940 --> 25:13.940
It's swell to have a city. It's divine to own a dick.

25:13.940 --> 25:17.940
From the tiniest little tagger to the world's biggest prick.

25:17.940 --> 25:20.940
So three chairs for your Willy or John Thomas.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.940
Hooray for your one-eyed child, the snake.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.940
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy, or your cock.

25:27.940 --> 25:31.940
You can wrap it up in ribbon, you can slip it in your sock.

25:31.940 --> 25:34.940
But don't take it out in public, or they will stick you in the dock.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.940
And you won't come back.

25:37.940 --> 25:40.940
Don't say I don't have enough sound effects to fill up a show,

25:40.940 --> 25:42.940
or you're going to get subjected to crap like that for two hours.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.940
I guarantee it.

25:44.940 --> 25:50.460
I know I got these on my very own. Hey, hey, hey, okay, big boy now

25:52.020 --> 25:54.260

25:59.820 --> 26:03.140

26:04.780 --> 26:10.700
You remember Wesley Willis yes, I do remember Wesley Willis. Do you have any I have Wesley Willis? I'm not gonna play with

26:10.700 --> 26:14.820

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

28:38.780 --> 28:41.780
A dream that is real

28:42.780 --> 28:54.780
Don't stop, don't stop!

28:54.780 --> 28:55.780
Come on, come on!

28:55.780 --> 28:58.780
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme

28:58.780 --> 29:01.780
Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friends

29:01.780 --> 29:04.780
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot

29:04.780 --> 29:07.780
No, we don't quit, you feel your innocence

29:07.780 --> 29:11.080
Do you like to dream? K, I like to dream, baby

29:11.080 --> 29:13.960

29:17.140 --> 29:20.180
Do you like to scream? O, so scream it out

29:20.180 --> 29:23.020
Dream or dream of a ticket individually

29:23.140 --> 29:25.940
The reason youyer we'll be for you're makin' a swim

29:26.440 --> 29:29.280
Dream or dream of a ticket individually

29:29.340 --> 29:32.120
The reason youyer we'll be for you're makin' a swim

29:32.540 --> 29:35.620
Dream or dream of a ticket alternatively

30:35.620 --> 30:36.620
Now who dat is?

30:36.620 --> 30:37.620

Now who dat is?

30:42.620 --> 30:43.620

Oh who dat is?

30:44.620 --> 30:45.620
Ya my baby mama

30:45.620 --> 30:47.620
Now yesterday you said you was witchin' boys

30:47.620 --> 30:49.620
But I saw you and Gina so holdin' to us

30:49.620 --> 30:51.620
You know the drill that I'm talkin' about

30:51.620 --> 30:52.620
That's right, I'm callin' you I'm sorry but I

30:52.620 --> 30:54.620
Not thinkin' bout time that I put you in check

30:54.620 --> 30:56.620
About who lost attention at the local space

30:56.620 --> 30:58.620
To all you fellas, this is just a game

30:58.620 --> 30:59.620
Max is a lady tryna build the name

30:59.620 --> 31:01.620
Wanna be a blood-drainin', get a piece

31:01.620 --> 31:03.620
I'll break your neck if I cast it in deep

31:03.620 --> 31:04.620
Round town soybeans like a farmer

31:04.620 --> 31:05.840
You like a Momma

31:05.840 --> 31:07.280
you better beware your Baby-Momma

31:07.360 --> 31:08.000
Who dat is?

31:08.000 --> 31:08.920
To My Baby's mommas

31:08.920 --> 31:09.940
No! Who dat is?

31:09.940 --> 31:10.680
to my Baby's Momma

31:10.680 --> 31:11.440
No! Who dat is?

31:11.440 --> 31:12.520
To my Baby's Momma

31:12.520 --> 31:13.300
No! Who dat is?

31:13.300 --> 31:14.180
to my Baby's Momma

31:14.320 --> 31:14.880
No! Who dat is?

31:14.880 --> 31:16.100
To my Baby's Momma

31:16.100 --> 31:16.880
No! Who dat is?

31:16.900 --> 31:17.860
to my Baby's Momma

31:17.860 --> 31:18.400
Now who dat is?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.760
to my Baby's Momma

31:19.760 --> 31:20.320
No! Who dat is?

31:20.320 --> 31:21.260
To My Baby's Momma

31:21.260 --> 31:27.700
those Bahmani songs are chosen

31:27.700 --> 31:34.700
one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder,

31:35.980 --> 31:42.820
one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder, one hit wonder.

31:42.820 --> 31:45.940
we think we figured it out

31:45.940 --> 31:51.120
orange lounge Radio

31:51.120 --> 31:58.120
Ah, the lovely karaoke stylings of me there in that little, uh, ditty, uh, one-hit wonder.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.120
Oh, oh, oh, can I have your autograph?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
No. Anyway.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.120
You guys are off! Ah, it's wet up!

32:05.120 --> 32:06.120
Okay.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
Ah, Song Joo.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.120
Drop your moves.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.120
I just showed him now he's not going to talk for the next half hour.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.120
Now we're really R-rated, you know, we've had nudity on for now.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.120
Not boobs.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.120
That was, that was our little, our little hippie-

32:17.120 --> 32:19.120
I don't know if anyone picked that up.

32:19.120 --> 32:24.940
little hippie-hoppy set there our fresh set our booty fresh set brought to you

32:24.940 --> 32:31.500
by cracker starting off from 2dx and then two songs from ddr solo 2000 six

32:31.500 --> 32:35.860
panel version of ddr dream a dream by captain jack the booty mix who that is

32:35.860 --> 32:42.300
my baby mama by aniket finishing that off ddr solo 2000 most people really

32:42.300 --> 32:46.060
don't give a shit about solo 2000 anyway sucks anyway exactly ever since that

32:46.060 --> 32:49.700
Infamous Tournament, that's kind of become the catchphrase. How did that happen anyway?

32:49.700 --> 32:53.380
You probably know more about the story behind Solo Sucks Anyway than I do. Because I'm sure

32:53.380 --> 32:57.100
a lot of people would like to know why, whenever they talk about Solo, somebody always jumps

32:57.100 --> 33:02.620
into the thread and goes, Solo sucks anyway! I think it resulted from a failed routine.

33:02.620 --> 33:05.660
I don't know the entire story. That's kind of what I heard too, is that somebody had

33:05.660 --> 33:09.100
failed a routine, and this is an arcade infinity tournament, and unfortunately I don't know

33:09.100 --> 33:12.900
the name of whoever failed it, so I can't... I did, but I couldn't remember it off the

33:12.900 --> 33:13.400
Right.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.200
So they failed their song, and they were just like,

33:16.200 --> 33:18.780
because they were giving away a solo machine at this tournament.

33:18.780 --> 33:19.280
Yes.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.280
And they were just like, eh, solo sucks anyway.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.080
I didn't want it.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.780
Anyway, so that's what this game is about.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.120
But DDR Solo, in the news around the community this week,

33:27.120 --> 33:30.200
this has everybody talking about something.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.080
This is the point where I look my head into my hand and go, eh.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.200
Let's talk about the story.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.280
I'm going to read this article here.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.960
It's from the San Diego Union-Tribune,

33:38.960 --> 33:42.680
and it's by Brian E. Clark from the San Diego Union-Tribune

33:42.680 --> 33:51.740
here, and it talks about the Poway Bowling Alley arcade replaces a game after youth protest

33:51.740 --> 33:57.800
the images in the game. Jennifer Stoafen couldn't believe her eyes. There on the Dance Dance

33:57.800 --> 34:02.680
Revolution machine, a video game immensely popular with preteens and teens were images

34:02.680 --> 34:09.740
of drugs, alcohol, and a scantily clad nurse riding up and down on a syringe. I was appalled

34:09.740 --> 34:12.260
to see that stuff flashing on the screen, said the 17-year-old

34:12.260 --> 34:13.340
Stoeffen.

34:13.340 --> 34:16.300
And she first saw the pictures way back in March

34:16.300 --> 34:19.220
on the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the Poway Fun Ball.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.700
She says, I'm a teenager, but I've seen

34:21.700 --> 34:23.500
five-year-olds playing this game.

34:23.500 --> 34:27.340
As far as I'm concerned, those images are totally unnecessary.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.940
Why do they need to have pictures

34:28.940 --> 34:32.620
with rows of pills, cocktails, ecstasy, and a syringe?

34:32.620 --> 34:35.140
Now, I'd like to know how that girl knew that the pills were

34:35.140 --> 34:36.380
ecstasy.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.460
That just completely bad.

34:37.460 --> 34:38.860
He was appalled, yet excited.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.860
You're an upstanding person would know what that is.

34:41.860 --> 34:44.860
Probably seen five-year-olds naked, too.

34:44.860 --> 34:45.860
All right.

34:45.860 --> 34:48.860
Well, let's talk about what she did.

34:48.860 --> 34:53.860
She basically documented pictures, contacted the company that placed the game in the bowling alley,

34:53.860 --> 34:56.860
and convinced the arcade owner to replace the machine.

34:56.860 --> 34:57.860
We don't know with what.

34:57.860 --> 34:58.860
Beachhead!

34:58.860 --> 35:00.860
It would be really, really funny...

35:00.860 --> 35:01.860
Sumo!

35:01.860 --> 35:05.860
It would be really funny if it was Humpahorse.

35:05.860 --> 35:07.860
That Namco horsey game.

35:07.860 --> 35:12.100
2002, CJ. Final furlong.

35:12.100 --> 35:17.660
So she basically got her way, she whined bitch to moan, and we shouldn't just say her because

35:17.660 --> 35:21.560
obviously she got other people in on this too, her little coalition, which happens to

35:21.560 --> 35:26.560
share a name with a very big lesbian, gay, bisexual coalition group, the Youth Advocacy

35:26.560 --> 35:31.820
Coalition or whatever, just kind of a funny side note anyway. Probably lesbians and gays

35:31.820 --> 35:36.140
wouldn't really care about DDR Solo 2000, they'd probably find it funny.

35:36.140 --> 35:39.920
it should also be noted that and so a few thousand just like that movie the

35:39.920 --> 35:42.940
last star for a recruit people for the army of satan

35:42.940 --> 35:48.220
i mean it's wildly no no i signed up just last week

35:48.220 --> 35:52.980
it would have a problem with looking at a nurse you're writing on a string not

35:52.980 --> 35:54.540
at all

35:54.540 --> 35:57.000
anyway so they go on to go out

35:57.000 --> 36:01.300
we feel really good about what we were able to accomplish and she graduated

36:01.300 --> 36:04.620
from high school she is a high school graduate good for her

36:04.620 --> 36:11.620
And she's going to study film at San Jose State University, so I imagine her next target will probably be in San Jose somewhere.

36:11.620 --> 36:18.620
Little kids or even teens don't need to see that stuff, and we were happy the business people we dealt with agreed with us too.

36:18.620 --> 36:23.620
So the moral of the story, if you bitch and moan and you threaten to sue, you'll get your way.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.620
Watch out Sunnyvale, she's coming for you.

36:26.620 --> 36:30.620
She's protesting these images, yet she's going to be a film student.

36:30.620 --> 36:35.620
Isn't that how, like, you know, independent filmmakers, like, win?

36:35.620 --> 36:37.620
Well, isn't- By being provocative.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.620
How do we know she's not going- God-inducing.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.620
Sundance is showing breath!

36:40.620 --> 36:44.620
Is she gonna get Sundance shut down for showing titties?

36:44.620 --> 36:48.620
But if the nudity is artistic, it's okay.

36:48.620 --> 36:51.620
Like Kate Winslet in Titanic, that was artistic nudity.

36:51.620 --> 36:54.620
It was ugly nudity also, but it was, you know, anyway.

36:54.620 --> 36:58.620
it was

36:58.620 --> 37:01.260
the whole thing is that

37:01.260 --> 37:05.260
this particular organist the i don't get it's not just this organization of any

37:05.260 --> 37:09.120
organization is that there's something out there that they don't like

37:09.120 --> 37:10.760
they have to use

37:10.760 --> 37:12.260
generalizations

37:12.260 --> 37:16.100
and point out every last negative thing instead of any positivity that it might

37:16.100 --> 37:16.660
promote

37:16.660 --> 37:19.640
any personal ddr first positive aspects

37:19.640 --> 37:23.720
you've got your exercise program right there i've been so many people to lose

37:23.720 --> 37:28.880
weight on it. It encourages people to get out and do things. On top of that, there are

37:28.880 --> 37:34.720
a lot of songs that have positive messages in there too. You know, there's just so much

37:34.720 --> 37:38.020
positive about it and they have to focus on all the negativity so a lot of people have

37:38.020 --> 37:40.520
to lose out because something crawled up their ass and died.

37:40.520 --> 37:45.520
Wait till solo 2004 comes out with the warded fetuses and crack whores in the background.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.520
Oh yeah.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.520
Can I be the devil's advocate?

37:48.520 --> 37:52.320
Come here. Irene, you want to be the devil's advocate, come here and tie it into the microphone.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.640
We want to hear this from the other presenter.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.240
I would have loved to have gotten an interview

37:55.240 --> 37:57.080
with this person, but I was too lazy.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.320
So we'll maybe get one next week.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.280
Ow.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.560
Oh, what was I going to say?

38:02.560 --> 38:04.100
You're going to be devil's advocate.

38:04.100 --> 38:04.840
Yeah, I know.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.760
I had a thought.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.920
OK, you said that just because a band of people

38:09.920 --> 38:12.960
got together and protested against something

38:12.960 --> 38:16.080
means that they get their way.

38:16.080 --> 38:21.640
But I think it's kind of like if there was a group of murderers

38:21.640 --> 38:22.560
out there

38:22.560 --> 38:25.120
of course that's going to be sickening to some people and they're going to band

38:25.120 --> 38:28.140
together and kind of complain about these murderers

38:28.140 --> 38:29.680
so i can't say that

38:29.680 --> 38:31.700
i fully agree with

38:31.700 --> 38:34.760
what you think about people that band together and complain about things

38:34.760 --> 38:35.880
because

38:35.880 --> 38:39.120
you know sometimes it's for good i mean this particular instance i don't feel so

38:39.120 --> 38:42.520
strongly that i think she's wrong

38:42.520 --> 38:45.520
but let's not say everyone that does that is terrible

38:45.520 --> 38:49.360
that's about it

38:49.360 --> 38:55.360
I guess so, Rob. Eat my ass. Yeah. So, any comments?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.360
I'm talking like way loud.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.360
Yeah, that's okay.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
Any comments?

38:59.360 --> 39:01.360
Uh, it's a very good point you're making.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.360
You're wrong!

39:02.360 --> 39:14.360
I think that part of it just has to do with the fact that people are generally close-minded.

39:14.360 --> 39:20.360
People aren't willing to accept an idea that might be different than their own.

39:20.360 --> 39:26.360
And so they're going to stick to that one idea and think that everybody has to adhere to it.

39:26.360 --> 39:31.360
Where, you know, apparently we disagree. I mean, that's obvious, because we like DVR.

39:31.360 --> 39:35.360
But, I mean, not just with that situation, but with a ton of situations in the world.

39:35.360 --> 39:40.360
It's intolerance and just generally being closed-minded.

39:40.360 --> 39:44.360
You know, I'm gonna be the devil's advocate for the devil's advocate.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.360
Okay.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.360
I need to make another point.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.360
We need to fill this damn show somehow, go for it.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.360
Let's just make this the Irene show.

39:50.360 --> 39:56.360
Okay, how about the people that were, you know, the kind of people that I can see being against is like the Nazis.

39:56.360 --> 40:00.360
You know, at one time people thought the Nazis were cool.

40:00.360 --> 40:03.360
I don't know if anybody here necessarily thought the Nazis were cool.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.360
Well not here, but back in the day.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.360
I don't think Jewish people ever thought the Nazis were very cool.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.360
That's because people were sheep.

40:12.360 --> 40:17.360
That's another example of the sheep mentality I'm often fond of bringing up.

40:17.360 --> 40:22.360
I think Adolf Hitler just had some insecurities because he only had one testicle.

40:22.360 --> 40:27.360
And he's just like, fuck you all, I'm just going to kill everyone because I have one testicle.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.360
How did you know he had one testicle?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.360
You'll like to know.

40:31.360 --> 40:37.360
Well, it's been reported from unknown sources

40:37.360 --> 40:43.280
sources cuz i just read a bunch of books and shut up. Nerd! You can read! Fuck you! At least I'm not a

40:43.280 --> 40:50.320
geep. Like Paul. A geep? Yeah, he has a geep on his shirt. But yeah, so, I mean, I guess it just depends on

40:50.320 --> 41:00.760
the situation, you know. It's circumstantial. If you have beliefs... Oh, that's my cue. I gotta go now. I'm just kidding.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.760
You're saying if you have beliefs, continue?

41:03.760 --> 41:06.760
Oh, I don't know, the draft noise threw me off.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.760
Yeah, if you have beliefs, wahhhh.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.760
Good point.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.760
I know, thanks, thanks.

41:12.760 --> 41:13.760
Yeah.

41:13.760 --> 41:18.760
I think the general moral of that is even though there are people who do

41:18.760 --> 41:23.760
occasionally win to take away things, not necessarily take away things that

41:23.760 --> 41:28.760
we enjoy, but just to inflict their closed-minded opinion on the masses,

41:28.760 --> 41:31.960
there should always be the people who are willing to

41:31.960 --> 41:35.200
you know, who stand against that, who are willing to say something, you know,

41:35.200 --> 41:39.600
we don't think this is right. Okay. You have no right to censor our lives.

41:39.600 --> 41:44.160
Yeah, and I also, like, one last thing, like, if they don't like it so much, why don't they just

41:44.160 --> 41:47.840
not go there? That's my whole opinion. It's like, why

41:47.840 --> 41:52.120
ruin the party for everybody else just because you have a problem with it?

41:52.120 --> 41:54.440
Nobody is forcing you to play this game. You know, everyone's

41:54.440 --> 41:59.160
so hip on, like, let's, you know, they, everyone puts disclaimers on things and stuff, you know,

41:59.160 --> 42:05.640
and why, why is it that this particular incident they have to take away are fun? Oh, okay. Oh,

42:05.640 --> 42:10.920
okay. Yeah, well, Brad, okay, go ahead. Okay, here's probably what the situation is for this

42:10.920 --> 42:16.920
one. Okay, you said it's at a bowling alley. Well, I'm guessing it's probably someone that's part of

42:16.920 --> 42:20.440
a league or a bowling league or something like that that sees a stupid game playing in the

42:20.440 --> 42:25.240
background, when they're waiting between frames to bowl.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.240
Bowling for God.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.600
Christian bowling.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.120
Highway to pins to heaven.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.280
Anyway, so probably it's just someone with nothing to do,

42:32.280 --> 42:36.720
complain about something, if it wasn't arguing against people

42:36.720 --> 42:40.520
killing whales or small animals or something like that.

42:40.520 --> 42:41.240
And children.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.920
Children, abortion or whatever.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.160
I'm sure they would have picked on something else.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.280
It's just like a starter to other things to debate about.

42:50.280 --> 43:01.280
So I just think, you know, it's probably no big deal, but like I've read on the responses for these, that not really anyone's worried about it and don't really think it's going to go too far, and I probably agree with them.

43:01.280 --> 43:12.280
Yeah, I don't see why the bowling alley owner decided to get rid of the game in the first place. I mean, it must not have been making him any money or something. There must be other factors involved.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.680
The thing I see, like, let me be like the extremist here for a second.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.680
Okay.

43:16.680 --> 43:25.440
Well, even on that one instance, that machine getting taken out is doing more damage to

43:25.440 --> 43:31.200
a larger amount of people than the images on the machine are doing to the little kids,

43:31.200 --> 43:32.200
I believe.

43:32.200 --> 43:36.200
And let's be an extremist here and say that what if all the machines eventually do get

43:36.200 --> 43:41.400
taken out, because this does go way too far, which I doubt it will.

43:41.400 --> 43:47.400
then that's definitely doing even more damage to a large amount of people than the little images of syringes and naked women.

43:47.400 --> 43:54.400
Fucking A. You see more of that kind of stuff on TV anyway than you do on the frickin' machines and arcades.

43:54.400 --> 43:59.400
And you don't have to take it to the bowling alleys? All the parents are drunk anyway, so who gives a shit?

43:59.400 --> 44:03.400
I know, but you don't want to watch their own kids so they put something that has syringes and stuff to babies for their kids.

44:03.400 --> 44:09.400
The only other thing I can think of why the manager would agree with something is if it's supposed to be a family environment

44:09.400 --> 44:14.220
and enough families banded together and said this is not the type of environment we want

44:14.220 --> 44:15.220
our children around.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.220
It's the Mormon Bowl.

44:16.220 --> 44:24.120
Their protests might have actually had some credence with the manager, but even so, first

44:24.120 --> 44:27.480
of all, they stand to lose money because I know for a fact DVR machines make a ton of

44:27.480 --> 44:28.480
money.

44:28.480 --> 44:33.200
And also, from having worked at three different arcades, I do know that they make those ratings

44:33.200 --> 44:34.560
stickers.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.800
You know how you have your ratings on your video games that they have at home?

44:38.800 --> 44:41.600
They have those rating stickers for arcade machines.

44:41.600 --> 44:45.320
Corporately owned arcades are actually required to have them.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.440
At least, I know Namco did.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.320
I'm not too sure about Gotham, but I know that most of them do.

44:50.320 --> 44:50.960
Rated M.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.800
But they're serious.

44:52.800 --> 44:56.880
I personally went through and put a lot of those stickers on machines

44:56.880 --> 45:00.360
so that any parent who had their child with them could look at the machine,

45:00.360 --> 45:02.480
look at the rating, and see if that's really something

45:02.480 --> 45:04.160
that they wanted their kid to play.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.880
Unfortunately, parents don't want to watch their children themselves

45:06.880 --> 45:10.880
to do their job, so they let dark kids babysit their children for them.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.880
It's the thing I notice at Golf Land all the time.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.880
Parents bring their kids there, and then just

45:18.880 --> 45:22.880
turn them loose. They run around everywhere. They're stomping on all sorts of machines,

45:22.880 --> 45:26.880
and shooting things.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.880
What's worst of all is that when we're playing on DDR, they

45:30.880 --> 45:34.880
start coming and playing with us. It's like eight people playing on the machine at once because all these little kids

45:34.880 --> 45:39.220
up on the rails because you're getting into my my chair i know i know i know

45:39.220 --> 45:40.120
but

45:40.120 --> 45:43.900
uh... why don't these parents watch the kids when they're when they drop them

45:43.900 --> 45:46.560
off here then you would it be able to take an actor role in what they're

45:46.560 --> 45:50.520
playing because if you just let your kids to lose there's way worse arcades

45:50.520 --> 45:54.580
out there besides d r

45:54.580 --> 45:57.600
this bowling alley i would like to know this boy only has like a police nine one

45:57.600 --> 46:00.600
one machine we're shooting people in there

46:00.600 --> 46:04.580
let's go to us and everything i don't have to get a life and hired and i have

46:04.580 --> 46:05.440
to take me

46:05.440 --> 46:09.600
what we've been together and think we're offended by the god people

46:09.600 --> 46:14.320
we just needed to be a nice club because i i i i think any resources all day and

46:14.320 --> 46:19.000
he's good horse raising values unconstitutional i say we just really are

46:19.000 --> 46:21.400
and we all get a deal pet fuck you

46:21.400 --> 46:23.020
when you get

46:23.020 --> 46:25.760
i want to do my new york wasn't bad

46:25.760 --> 46:27.360
i'm gonna throw at you now

46:27.360 --> 46:29.360
Okay, yeah, we're weird.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.360
Malnourished Neopets.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.360
I think, Rob...

46:31.360 --> 46:32.360
Okay, yes?

46:32.360 --> 46:36.360
I think it's about, we should, you know, definitely have my, my ramp.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.360
Okay, we'll get, we'll get you your ramp after the next break.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.360
I'm gonna go look at the account if I can.

46:40.360 --> 46:40.360
Okay.

46:40.360 --> 46:45.360
However, I, I was gonna make a point and I just forgot it, so I guess I won't make a point.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.360
I guess...

46:46.360 --> 46:47.360
What point's at Cal Expo?

46:47.360 --> 46:49.360
What do you guys think's gonna happen after this?

46:49.360 --> 46:50.360
After what?

46:50.360 --> 46:52.360
You think that more machines are gonna get taken out from other places?

46:52.360 --> 46:53.360
No.

46:53.360 --> 46:56.880
Do you think this, I mean, this person said they're gonna go on to DDR Freak, which is

46:56.880 --> 46:59.680
probably the most well-known DDR site that's out there.

46:59.680 --> 47:03.960
Go look at their machine locations page and start hitting every Solo 2000 machine out

47:03.960 --> 47:04.960
there.

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
Did you see how many were on there?

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
A lot.

47:06.960 --> 47:13.440
I think, honestly, the owners of these places, they've had them long enough to know, you

47:13.440 --> 47:16.160
know, what's going on in the game.

47:16.160 --> 47:20.760
They've had them long enough to know the kind of content is inside, you know, and there's,

47:20.760 --> 47:25.740
You know, I think they would have taken him out by now if they really felt passionately

47:25.740 --> 47:26.740
about that.

47:26.740 --> 47:27.920
And here comes Brad.

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
And here's Matt.

47:28.920 --> 47:29.920
He hasn't finished.

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
Thank you.

47:30.920 --> 47:34.280
Actually, I think what's going to happen is these people are going to call up these establishments

47:34.280 --> 47:38.240
with the Solo 2000 machines, and they're just going to get laughed at.

47:38.240 --> 47:41.060
Because these people are going to be like, yeah, I'm just going to take this machine

47:41.060 --> 47:45.240
that I paid a couple grand for and just get rid of it because you don't like it.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.740
Okay, go screw yourself.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.120
That's what they're probably going to end up saying.

47:49.120 --> 47:54.340
It's just ridiculous to even try to take these machines out because of a few images of flash

47:54.340 --> 47:56.700
in the background that you don't even notice anyways.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.780
Which I'm sure they'd be like, oh, it's subliminal then.

47:58.780 --> 47:59.780
They don't notice it.

47:59.780 --> 48:05.580
It gets in their subconscious and they'll become murderers and rapists.

48:05.580 --> 48:06.580
Just one thing, though.

48:06.580 --> 48:12.460
I mean, it may be a sad thing, I should say, but unfortunately greed ruins over morality

48:12.460 --> 48:13.460
in a lot of cases.

48:13.460 --> 48:21.460
I mean, are you going to throw away an income of well into the thousands because it offends somebody?

48:21.460 --> 48:25.460
I mean, true, there's some offensive material that I think should be removed on occasion,

48:25.460 --> 48:32.460
but on top of that, though, this is an instance where this small group is not really going to be able to make much of a difference.

48:32.460 --> 48:34.460
I mean, true, right?

48:34.460 --> 48:39.460
Yeah, I agree, and in fact, also, let's just say, for instance, that they do get away with it.

48:39.460 --> 48:43.460
Solo 2000 gone. Really, would you miss it? I wouldn't miss it.

48:43.460 --> 48:50.460
I mean, it was just, I don't miss the game. I don't even care if they get rid of it.

48:50.460 --> 48:54.460
Good for them. Get a better game. Get a Max 2 machine. Hell, I mean...

48:54.460 --> 48:59.460
Well, okay, but, okay, say you go and upgrade the Solo 2000 to a fourth mix, okay?

48:59.460 --> 49:02.460
Look at the background and kick the can. It's a bunch of flying heroin needles.

49:02.460 --> 49:04.460
You've still got the same thing going on.

49:06.460 --> 49:08.460
I still think Sinkorondavoo has the best video.

49:08.460 --> 49:17.460
Yeah, that's right! Then they'll just want a Max 2 machine removed because there's lesbians all over the secret rendezvous video, and it's a secret message that everybody should become a lesbian.

49:17.460 --> 49:18.460
Lesbians.

49:18.460 --> 49:19.460
Okay.

49:21.460 --> 49:28.460
You know, Solo 2000 is a good machine, you know. It's fun, it attracts crowds, people actually go look for them.

49:28.460 --> 49:32.460
We have a new face to the show, Glenn would like to contribute an opinion.

49:32.460 --> 49:34.460
I just completely lost my train of thought.

49:34.460 --> 49:39.740
Here's the thing about the whole, because basically what it is, it's censorship.

49:39.740 --> 49:43.640
And censorship never stops, it just keeps going further and further and further and

49:43.640 --> 49:47.300
nobody's going to be happy until there's nothing left because somebody will be offended by

49:47.300 --> 49:48.300
something.

49:48.300 --> 49:55.180
Either it's degradation of women by the songs or images or whether it's subliminal messages

49:55.180 --> 50:00.260
that they think they hear or drug use or anything, it will never end.

50:00.260 --> 50:07.260
So if they keep, if it's a trend and they keep caving in to these people, then DDR will

50:07.260 --> 50:11.060
be gone and then there will be something next after that.

50:11.060 --> 50:15.300
So a message to all you arcade owners out there, grow some balls!

50:15.300 --> 50:16.300
Only in America.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.860
Wash your pussies!

50:18.860 --> 50:23.620
And a message out there also as well to the coalition there that's taking out all the

50:23.620 --> 50:24.620
machines out there.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.500
First, we would love to hear your opinion, so please contact the station and we'll give

50:28.500 --> 50:31.860
you a fair interview and some equal time and let you present your side of the story because

50:31.860 --> 50:36.380
we're curious what your motivations are and maybe you can talk us out of playing DDR.

50:36.380 --> 50:43.420
Yeah, yeah. Anyway. That was funny. Second off to the coalition, there's a place called

50:43.420 --> 50:49.900
Laser Force in Sacramento. Go take their machine. If you need a place to properly deposit this

50:49.900 --> 50:55.860
machine, I live at. Alright, anyway. We'll talk more about Laser Force and other evil

50:55.860 --> 50:59.460
all the money things when we come back uh... in the meantime we're gonna play

50:59.460 --> 51:01.700
something from drum mania

51:01.700 --> 51:04.860
replace something from what i think it's our freaks also

51:04.860 --> 51:08.880
we're gonna play uh... our namesake here at the lovely orange lounge and their

51:08.880 --> 51:11.100
little medley from the new guitar

51:11.100 --> 51:14.860
yes very good i really don't worry here we go

51:14.860 --> 51:21.860
we'll be back in about five minutes

53:44.860 --> 53:46.860
I can't believe it, a little sharp though.

53:46.860 --> 53:48.860
Let's get this thing off the ground

55:16.860 --> 55:42.260
One day when I got hungry, I told you with a cough I had to be shit, Uncle Ghandi

55:42.260 --> 55:43.860
Cool it, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle

55:43.860 --> 55:45.660
Uncle Dandy, he is me

55:45.660 --> 55:47.460
He's the type of Spider-Man

55:47.460 --> 55:49.260
And I know that he will help me

55:49.260 --> 55:51.060
As much as he can

55:51.060 --> 55:54.260
The type of Spider-Man is what I want to be

55:54.260 --> 55:57.860
But there are no cut-in birds who want to ride with me

55:57.860 --> 56:01.460
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on the line

56:01.460 --> 56:05.060
But every speed in kakuta is fine

56:05.060 --> 56:06.660
Kakuta

56:06.660 --> 56:10.060
I am the type of spider in kakuta

56:10.060 --> 56:13.520
I find my little sexy and he's a good pal

56:13.520 --> 56:17.060
Sexy, sexy, sexy and he's a good pal

56:17.060 --> 56:20.560
Boy, I'm a sexy girl, that's my aim

56:32.560 --> 56:35.860
I love to fly the taxi, I like it very much

56:35.860 --> 56:39.360
Even though I have no license, I always find a clutch

56:39.360 --> 56:42.860
I can bind it off my head, I can bind it off my feet

56:42.860 --> 56:46.860
And I have no problem getting better than me

57:16.860 --> 57:18.860
And the sexy time is my game

58:16.860 --> 58:25.860
I am a sexy diamond man, I am a sexy diamond man, I am a sexy diamond man.

58:25.860 --> 58:26.860
My bad.

58:26.860 --> 58:33.860
And now I would like to present to you the comic stylings of Irene, future comedian extraordinaire.

58:33.860 --> 58:39.860
Keep clapping, I'm kidding.

58:39.860 --> 58:44.200
so these uh... two muffins were uh... baking in the oven

58:44.200 --> 58:45.480
and uh...

58:45.480 --> 58:47.900
the first one says to the other one

58:47.900 --> 58:50.200
you know it's getting pretty hot in here

58:50.200 --> 58:51.560
and the second one's like

58:51.560 --> 58:58.560
holy shit the talking muffin

59:21.560 --> 59:23.560
Yeah

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:30.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.560
is

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.560
is

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.560
is

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.560
is

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.560
do

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.560
do

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.560
do

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:52.560
I'm just a disturbed guy.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:48.440
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're live for our very first show. It's about

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.040
eight o'clock. We're halfway through it. What do you know? We made it this far. So let's

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.080
if we can get to the other end.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:00.160
I think now would be a good time in the show for Jamie to be given space to do her little

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160
rant.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160
How does that sound, Jamie?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
That sounds delightful.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160
All right.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160
Let's hear it.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160
Let's hear your little rant for the week.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.720
This is Jamie's big fuck you unbelief.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.000
That goes to, I would have to say, parents at Roseville Golf Land.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.880
Who agrees with me here?

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:26.880
Especially one delightful lady who I saw putting her three-year-old child on the keyboard mania machine to change a diaper.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.880
Now, I knew a lot of people called that a shitty game, but...

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:41.880
She was checking his diaper, but she put the child on the keyboard, and I couldn't help myself but go up there and go,

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.880
I would go up there and go, excuse me, ma'am, and mentally I was going, and I used the term loosely,

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.880
would you mind moving your child off of this machine?

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.880
Or I could go get management and make them, you know, have you pay for it.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.880
And she just looked at me.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.880
Oh, duh, I'm sorry.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.880
That was, yeah, that was a derp moment.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.880
But, you know, that has me thinking.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.880
You know, we're missing a whole keyboard on one side.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.880
We're missing keys on player one.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.040
you know our drum mania machine was screwed up for a while at you know

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.760
guitar freaks is none of their issues

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.580
although I did see a parent walk off while their

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.080
three-year-old, not three-year-old, more like a five-year-old was holding one of those

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.720
big guitar controllers

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.920
which I have issues holding. Mommy it hurts. It feels like

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.440
burning. But you know and I actually caught

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.760
those, I was playing drum mania at the time, I called the parent back and said you need to get your

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.920
you know you need to help your child because if they drop this on their foot they will likely

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.200
break their toes. Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseville

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.480
Golf Land, but any golf land. And the arcades. Because Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around,

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.920
Jamie. Oh yeah, baby. And the many different arcades. If you don't mother your child, Jamie

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.920
will. Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.760
But no, the whole issue, you know, there's like parents who let their little children

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.620
run loose and they get on the DDR machine. Like when we were at, um, Scandia. The little

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:10.080
child that got up behind me and I nearly stepped on this kid.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080
And I mean, I felt...

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
You did step on her in there, didn't you?

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
I think I did.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.800
But, you know, I turned around, I found her, I think it was her aunt, but I, you know,

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.320
I gave her my tokens to, you know, let her know I felt bad, but...

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.320
Because it's not the kid's fault.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.320
Well, I mean, it is...

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.320
They don't really know any better, but if their parents aren't doing their job, how

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.880
are they ever going to learn?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.880
You know, like that prime example of the people we got kicked out of golf in the other night?

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880
Oh God.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.320
You know, they were getting up, bumming around the machine, we had management kick them out.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.820
what we actually got a restraining order that night

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:42.360
we have got a golf land restraining order tonight i was awesome

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.140
but i was having a problem are part of the scene while i was playing annually

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.440
whacked in the face one and then his they can if you make a decision to get

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.780
almost hit with your ass

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.080
deluxe no that was when i stuck my fist out to do the side of the i mean you

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.180
know how you have to figure handouts but i don't know how many parlous we have

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.000
listening but

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.540
you seek out your hand side aside to do two lots

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.040
and i nearly palm the guy in the face

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.520
and i thought it was it because he was a moron itself

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.440
you know i can't go ready to give it to the people i fear of my hand off

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440
simple

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.020
i'll tell you that that's that's the red you know

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:20.420
if we have any parents who are listening to show a seriously doubt it

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:25.180
but still if you have younger siblings you know make sure

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.340
and then someone's got an eye on them you know look out for the little less

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:30.260
because we sure as hell are

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.560
it's not our jobs if they're not your children

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.040
Yeah, we're going to step on them, and then they'll learn.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.280
But I don't know, I would not consciously

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.240
step on a little child if I couldn't help it.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.400
Anyway, that's my rant.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.000
If you'd like to comment on Jamie's Fuck You of the Week,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.160
or you'd like to comment on anything else we talked

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.540
about in the past hour of the show,

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.440
I encourage you to join our chat room, which is located

01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:01.600
on server IRC.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.280
And it's just Channel Orange Lounge, all one word.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.560
So we look forward to seeing you in there.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.280
And we'll take your comments and maybe talk about some of

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.240
them on the show.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.840
In future weeks on the Orange Lounge, we are looking into

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.440
getting the phone system here so we can take

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.240
phone calls on the air.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.800
But we're kind of doing some test runs to see what kind of

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.920
reception the show gets for you.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920
Because that's going to be a large investment to get the

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.440
phones here.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.000
So it might be a little while before we get those.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.360
But we'd like to start taking phone calls.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.560
That'll be cool.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.240
All right.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.520
Other things we wanted to talk about.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:41.520
Jamie, before we went into the break, we talked about we were sending out a message to the little coalition there, the little anti-DDR army, the anti-DDR army in San Diego that's taking out Solo2K machines.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:49.520
I recommended their next target be Laser Force in Sacramento, and I thought you might want to take this opportunity, because you've already initiated a local boycott.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520
Yes.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.520
Now you can initiate a national boycott at Laser Force. International.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.520
The one issue with that is that I don't want them to go targeting every place that has a solo.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.520
Like the Walmart and Lodi.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.520
Now the Walmart and Lodi rules.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.520
Yes it does.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.520
Any place you can buy Pringles and then go straight to play DDR just rules.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.520
Thank you.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.520
And I won so many toys out of the crane machines there, it's not even funny.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520
But let's hear why Laser Force sucks. Tell your Laser Force story.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.760
really supposed to have to do last night

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.600
with uh... the date that uh... iguana girl

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.820
and i and

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.620
a certain and names

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.440
well cockspanker

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.040
correct figure for bucks

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.600
to and is no longer worthy of any more

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.720
we are going to have laser force

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.880
check out the new solo machine right around the corner from my house

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.200
and people please don't come to my house anyway

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.380
we go in and you know we're all playing nobody's getting up and doing anything

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.400
and you know this woman's asking questions you know we're answering she's

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.840
got her kids there and then this group of little girls gets up by the machine

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.040
and we've all been taking our turns and using a coin line anyone with common

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.480
sense can see what a coin line is

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:13.040
um... eventually the mother got up and was complaining that oh you know my kid

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.720
wanted to get up here and you know we explained the coin line and we're like okay well you

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.600
we're gonna go ahead let your kid go we'll go ahead and you know trade this

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.720
turn just give us some tokens because we'd already had tokens in machine and

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.680
she's like no I gotta go and they left and then management came up and just

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.600
like tried to ream us we were being they were being very oh my goodness I can't

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:43.740
believe it everything's ruined as many times as I can fit it in anyway anyway

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:51.260
We had issues with them. Basically, we just said we weren't going to come back and I made

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:56.740
sure to let everybody I knew. And so far, I think we've had a fairly successful boycott,

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.540
haven't we? I mean, I understand that their business isn't doing very well. But I mean,

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.020
it's just though nobody really plays the solo there anyway, so they should just give me the

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:13.100
machine and then we wouldn't have to boycott them anymore. That is crime logic.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:19.100
But then that woman is going to have to come to your house and remove the machine because she finds it offensive.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.100
Hey, it's my house.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.100
Yes, but the poor furniture. It's offended.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.100
Hey, Jamie has a guard cap.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.100
Yes, Shermy would kill her.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.100
Shermy would roll around on the floor and out-cube her or something.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:39.100
But no, if somebody came to my house saying you can't play this in your own home,

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:43.500
the point i'd break out the katana and decapitate somebody, okay?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.700
Oh, it's evil, Jamie, ladies and gentlemen. It's in my house, it's self-defense.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.680
Jamie's on! Jamie's on! No!

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.260
Oh, oh, the steroids!

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.860
Making me feel badly!

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.300
I like that, uh...

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.540
Laser Force sucks. I mean,

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:04.140
I'm sorry, the only official laser tag game that I can, you know,

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.900
put my name behind is

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:10.340
Cuzar, played for four years, spent a good fifteen grand there.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:14.540
We should say that Loki was a Cuzar nerd long before he was a DER nerd.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.820
And we need to hear it between Zach.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.940
Yes, Cuzar, it was my first love.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.540
Once Cuzar left

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.620
last year around May, I was very sad, still sad to this day.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.300
And anyways,

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.020
DDR became my new addiction.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.020
I just have to say, Q's are rules, Laser Force sucks ass, and they were almost out of business

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:42.780
just when Q's are went and left, and then they came back to, like, a festering, uh,

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:50.660
sore. So, they can die. It really does smell like pee in there. And they smell like pee.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.540
I'm glad I'm not the only person that noticed how bad it stinks in there. But we know, keep

01:11:55.540 --> 01:12:00.100
in mind though, we've also got, um, Laser X at Country Club Lanes, and we still have

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.520
whatever thing is that golf land

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.460
i'm sorry you're talking about laser x

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.720
that there are alternate there are local alternatives to laser force yes if you

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.560
have to shoot the infrared beam at somebody

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.840
and no unfortunately i do not have dramatic music to play when people are

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.700
are crying over a lot their losses

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:24.000
but i do have cam laughter

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.880
yeah

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.760
anyway yet if you don't know if last year i hope we can play flowers for

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.920

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.780
oh yeah i can i could look at one of them

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.180
crying

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:57.700
let's bring them over here i would ask for a quick prayer

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.320
delivery of the microphone

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.860
you know you have all the mike faraway from you because it it's very sensitive

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.760
it's like a penis it's very sensitive

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.620
i'm like you and i don't get too close to the head or you're getting shot

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.100
anyway

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.820
uh...

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.220
it

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.980
i don't want to hear about you and when i got a day if you ever played

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.380
your play do you

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:22.580
yet i have a and what do you think

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.000
it's a penis and the contest is that

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.480
that jimmy doesn't have a penis last time i checked

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.240
but i can't get into the contest

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.840
uh...

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.280
i can make one

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.720
what do you think of this whole thing this is my show this this house that you

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.560
i would like to be transformed

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.800
my heart has a complete disaster area right now being overran

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.920
by a bunch of g

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.840
and i am a way to get that i need

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.760
and back in the middle of it

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.760
You're now an honorary geek. You're the meat in the geek sandwich.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.260
Oh, that was just a bad image.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:05.760
I was just not somewhere I wanted to be.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.760
Brian and Meat at the same time

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.760
quotes Irene.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.760
And followed by a

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.760
Very descriptive. Any comments you want to add out there to the Bahmani people listening?

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.760
Because we have quite a few people listening right now.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.760
Is there anything you want to say to the addicts out there of Imani?

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.760
Besides the fact that they turn my house completely upside down when you throw these types of things?

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.760
And that I'm going, I have no house and no life right now?

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.760
Well, there's a pool. You could go swim.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.760
Here's a ball, Brian. Why don't you go bounce it?

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.760
I actually want to thank you very much for the use of this.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.760
Yay, Brian!

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.760
I can edit in your honor.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760
Awww.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760
It's a pink dinosaur.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.760
Okay, that's it. Thanks for being on the show, Brian. We appreciate it.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.760
Woo, Brian!

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760
I'm the only one clapping!

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.760
Yeah, and you don't have a microphone.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.760
What now? Let's get away from Bahmani. You're right, we can't fill two hours with Bahmani.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.760
Yes, we can.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.760
Or what do you want to talk about then?

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.760
Bahmani.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.860
We were talking about you know what our personal cross-dresser is not here tonight

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:25.700
Yeah, right. It was supposed to be here tonight. We had our cross-dressing fellow admin is not here tonight. Where's that?

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:31.180
I knew he had our cross-dressing para playing para somewhere. I knew he had to work today

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:37.380
So maybe he didn't show up because of that. Oh, you know, he's out working at what what corner is he working today? He's uh,

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.060
That would probably be one of the corners of the par machine

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:52.060
But if my Ototo-chan is listening tonight, dude, get here. Let's fill it with witty banter.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.060
Okay.

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.060
Okay.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:59.060
Well, you come on. What do you want to talk about? Is there anything, Imani, you really want to talk about?

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:04.060
Yeah, sure. How about Matt say something?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:11.420
I'd like to announce for all those people that do play The Sims out there for DWI, actually,

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:17.380
Bimani Ruler, you might know him from DDR Mania X, he's having a blitz for the next

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.380
two weeks.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:22.540
He's going to be releasing a new file every day and if anyone hasn't played his stuff,

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540
do play it.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.540
It's awesome.

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:32.440
Today, in fact, his release was the Classic Party Triathlon, which I have to say was awesome.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.200
So go try that and that's it.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.720
Everyone watch the webcam because every once in a while something crazy is going to pop

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.120
up, something out of control, something you didn't expect, something crazy and wild.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:51.120
If you'd like to visit our webcam just go to our website at http colon slash slash orange

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.400
lounge dot sky S-K-I-E dot C-X and it's right there in the upper right corner.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.640
It's a little tricky to find but if you look you'll find it and there's a little thing

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.640
that will take you to the webcam.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.640
Unfortunately we're being ghetto this week and the page doesn't refresh. You have to reload it every minute or so.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.640
But we'll have that fixed for next week. Because we just got the website finished today.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.640
A big hand to Glen. A big thank you to Glen for finishing the website.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.640
And Brad comes back from the webcam room with this weird grin on his face.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.640
Should we fear? Should we be scared?

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.640
Maybe you should look at the cam. Hopefully it got cut.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.640
It looks like somebody's parrying the deluxe.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.640
That's Brian playing DDR after he just...

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.640
Brian's playing DDR after he was just in here slamming the rest of us.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
I know, now he's going...

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.640
See, it's more truth that Bemani just owns everybody. I'm sorry.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.640
I think I have DDR.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.640
Okay, Paul goes to play DDR now.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640
Where's my picture?

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640
Okay.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.640
Anyway, so were we going to...

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640
I have an idea.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640
Irene has an idea.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640
I was going to talk...

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.640
Okay, go ahead.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640
What were you going to say?

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640
Obviously, we can talk about Max 2, because that's like what everybody talks about these days.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.640
We have Burning Heat now.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.640
We just unlocked Burning Heat yesterday, which is kind of a big deal.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.640
It's really the only song anybody seems to care about in Max 2, is Burning Heat.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.640
And Kakumei, but Kakumei kind of...

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.640
It was the big deal in the beginning, but then as people started unlocking Burning Heat, it was just like,

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.640
Oh my god, Burning Heat!

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.640
Burning Heat makes me cum.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.640
So what do you guys think about Max 2? What do you guys think about...

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.640
Max 2 was the first new DDR that I had a reason to get excited over.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:32.640
Max 2 is everything that Max should have been, and I think that's kind of been the opinion across the board,

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.640
because it's got way more songs than 5th Mix had. Well, no, I'm sorry, it's got about the same amount of songs as 5th Mix had.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.640
But Max had, like, 40 songs. It had nothing. Max had way more, it was nice.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:47.640
So what's missing from Max 2 that you'd like to see in our next installment of DDR?

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.640
In Max 3, if they should actually take it that far?

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:55.000
ability to have flat dark mode, flat dark mode, gives dark and flat run on the same

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.900
modifiers, so you can't use them both. I think, you know, we should be able to have

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:06.960
more songs and less, maybe not less ONI modes, but make ONI modes, make more ONI modes accessible

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:12.640
at first and not unlocking a lot of ONI modes, because I notice we unlock a lot of ONI modes

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.080
and hardly any of them are songs. I think they're either even between ONI and

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.680
And I think people want more songs to play because Oni mode is, I guess in my opinion,

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.000
a little bit harder for people because it's a perfect attack thing, you know, or a great

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
attack.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
But it's the challenge.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Yeah, it's really hard.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.360
Now, remember in fourth mix how they had the, you could come home and make your own non-stops

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.840
on the home version of the third mix and save it to the card and then take it to the arcade

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.840
and play your own non-stop?

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.640
They should do something like that for Oni.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.440
I can see why they hesitate doing it because then everybody would just make a ten song non-stop

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.440
of a bunch of basics.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.840
able to stay on the machine all day, but maybe limit it, the homemade non-stops to as many

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.440
songs as you would have on the normal game.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.440
Yeah, or maybe a certain amount of sets you have to have in a song or something like that.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.120
I actually think that it might work better to do something very similar to how 2DX has

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:10.120
it. You know, have an expert course, where, I mean, an expert course in the sense that

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.800
the BeatMania expert courses are in, where you have the following percentage.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.040
In the chat room, Joe Mama suggesting that we just have only maniacs.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.640
If you put a song out there on the Oni mode, you can only put in maniac stuff.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.800
That's a good idea.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800
But then there's people out there that maybe want to play Oni,

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.600
they can't play maniacs.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.160
Do you think that they maybe should have had an easy Oni chorus?

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.680
I know, exactly.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.560
Just playing devil's advocate.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.840
What I'd like to see would be to have actually more unlockable stuff.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.320
Not necessarily more songs.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.760
I mean, more songs obviously would be great.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.400
But let's say, for instance, we can have different sets for a song being

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:49.360
added in or something like that or maybe even, I don't know, just have like sort of a challenge

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.980
mode where you play and you get more points, you know, to go towards, you know, unlocking

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:58.640
songs but have it be like a certain really hard, strange thing that you haven't seen

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.720
before or even, you know, bringing back solo via Megamixes where you have three songs,

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720
you know, play together.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.280
Megamixes are pretty cool. That's something I'd like to see come back.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280
Megamixes.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.280
Hey.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.560
You remember how in Solo 2000, which is getting way too much talk time on the show tonight,

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:21.560
One course had Afro Nova, Dropout, and I think Wild Rush, and the cool thing about it is it wasn't just a non-stop, the songs actually mixed together.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.560
That's pretty neat.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560
I remember that.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.560
I guess, we'll go ahead and finish the talk because I'm going to change the subject a little.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Oh, okay. Well, about the different steps, like Matt was saying, what I kind of missed was, it was kind of cool, I think it was on one of the versions of Third Mix, there was alternate steps for some of the songs.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.560
You would press, I think it was like, down, down, you know.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:45.560
It was the Club of Pen Steps, actually. They had it for, like, Brilliant To You, Keep On Me. I'd love to see some of that come back.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:50.560
What about new stuff? We've been talking about, like, a lot of old stuff we'd like to see make a return.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.560
How do you think Konami can keep DDR kind of innovative?

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:00.560
Because let's look at Five Key. Five Key's gonna be dying this time with the release of Final.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.560
Unless they decide to do something with Beat Mania 3, because Beat Mania 3 is a Five Key series.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.560
But for all practical purposes, the original five key series is kind of gone.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.560
So how can Konami prevent themselves from releasing a DDR final?

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.560
What can they do to keep...

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560
They could put a foot pedal.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.560
On DDR?

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:21.560
No, I've often thought that they need to do partner solo.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.560
Well, you know, have the six panels solo set up, but with two players.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.560
I mean, instead of having the linked machines like they work now,

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.560
but not if you put enough space in between the machine.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:43.560
Or set it up like the three-player Para Para, where you have three panels, with the large monitor in the front, DDR could be made to accommodate that.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.560
And have it with solo.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:52.560
I would like to see DDR on a humongous screen, like, I say pump it up, is on a huge screen.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.560
I just don't like, though, how...

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560
Go to Fry.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560
I don't like it.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.560
Oh, I don't like, I don't like the setup.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.320
That's something, that's something that's worth talking about here if you want to change

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320
something for a little bit.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.320
We'll talk about that when we come back for break.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320
Let's stay there for a little bit.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320
Let's keep talking about Max.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320
Max is a magical...

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:12.440
A giant, I think, the thing I don't like about Pump is it's got a huge screen but then it's

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.200
got this humongous box that just kind of sits out there and the screen goes back.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.920
It's like looking at the end of a tunnel to see what you're looking at.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.920
It's kind of odd.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.920
I think, I'd like it to look more like 2DX versus a giant freaking huge...

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.400
I think you're too tall for Pump It Up.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.240
I'm too tall. Another of the names you can add to it would be more modifiers to like,

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:35.960
say for instance, stuff you can do with the arrows. Like have them all mixed up, have

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:39.680
some things I thought even for doing some of my edits and stuff. Maybe even have it

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.920
where like stuff in the background kind of helps you, you know, not be able to see the

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.280
arrows just right. You know, have a bunch of arrows all of a sudden appear in the background.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.560
Just crazy shit like that. Well, it's kind of a lot of people say Flash in the Night

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.440
was like that on max because it would go flash, the screen would do this seizure thing, like

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.480
amazing seizure robots, flash. And then it was kind of hard to see your arrows, so.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.400
They also need to put in like super random mode like they have in 7x guitar freaks, where

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:11.080
like in normal shuffle mode, like all the up arrows become something like left, down,

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.440
or right. But you can have them so all the arrows are completely random, so they'd still

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.760
appear in the same place, but they'd all be completely random and not appear in any way.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.520
figure out some way to shuffle double steps because I'm just sick of being able to only

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:34.520
play it on regular or play it on mirror. And really that's just the same. Yeah. Yes. I

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.920
had a dumb idea once because I'm terrible at... Now Irene, no idea is a dumb idea. Oh,

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:46.460
wait till you hear this. This is pretty stupid. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm terrible at freestyling

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:53.220
So I always thought it would be so cool if they put a screen on the back of DDR so that you could turn around and not fuck up.

01:24:53.220 --> 01:25:02.700
Because I remember when I first played Only You, and I tried to turn around again, and I totally messed up because I don't know how to freestyle.

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:06.460
Well, that's part of freestyling, is learning how to turn around.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.460
Now, I know you have issues with Mirror, but...

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:14.700
You know, I fucking hate Mirror. Mirror is the devil.

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.980
uh... okay uh... what i meant was like you know just if you want to turn around

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:25.120
and start doing that there is some shit like that you know i can't look at a

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.980
step chart and know what i'm doing because

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.220
i'm a complete return but i think you're saying that they should make a a

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.220
freestyle for dummies machine yes yes

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:38.820
do you have to think that if you are a cell bdr some shit like that i guess

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:43.300
that's a possibility of the expensive but i think that i don't know how

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.400
they would be able to pull it off like it would block the view of people who

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.180
want to watch anyway so

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.580
that'd be kind of pointless

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:51.940
and the bars would

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.480
obviously pose a problem because some people need bars

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.180
somebody in the back of the room is yelling and you can't hear it over the

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:02.120
microphone suggesting that they just take the bars off the next DDR mix

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.880
there is going to be a tournament coming up in august i happen to know there's

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.060
going to be a tournament in concord at mountain mikes that they are taking the

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.000
bar off the machine for freestyle

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.540
that should be pretty cool

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.620
uh... a lot more details on that assess their announce looking at the chair in

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:20.020
here we've got your mama suggesting that they have the care of a different speed

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.480
for like a modifier you can tell you care of the gutter that would be crazy i

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.860
don't know i thought was a little too weird

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.100
it is any

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:32.720
besides adding new panels uh... adding new screens bigger screens or anything

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.080
konami could do to the game itself to make it more interesting or do they

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.960
pretty much just have to trash the whole damn thing and start over actually i got

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.960
I've got another idea. Kind of similar with Para Para where you have set routines to do.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.960
Maybe set something up like have a freestyle mode or something where they actually have a set routine for a song.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960
Freestyle for dummies.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.960
Yeah, basically. You know, kind of get ideas or something.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.960
White people dancing mode.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.960
Exactly.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960
Teaching you how to do country line dancing.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:04.960
I wouldn't imagine this would actually be a new DDR, but you know, they've got Para Para, they have DDR.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.200
do something that combines the both together where you have like maybe a

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.640
sensitive panel beneath you plus the sensors above soon it's not just where

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.380
you wave your hands or how hard you are where you're stepping but you are doing

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:21.680
everything and you memorize their dances or you just have to be in the right

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.080
place at the right time you know I was thinking um this might sound kind of I

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.960
don't know if I'd explain it right but I was thinking maybe they'd add like mini

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.840
panels maybe where you could do like little hand plants you know maybe I could

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.560
have like the floor, little moles would come up out of the floor and you could step on

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560
them with your feet.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560
Maybe that spider stomp.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.680
No, you know, maybe that should be it, maybe they should just make the whole thing like

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.680
a-

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.680
You know what?

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.360
The hell with DDR, we want Spider Stomp 2DX.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360
How's that sound?

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360
No.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360
No, no.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.560
How about they just get rid of actual panels and they just make the whole pad pressure

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.560
sensitive.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560
So-

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.560
Pressure sensitive?

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.560
That would be an interesting-

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:08.560
And like the whole thing would be just one huge panel, and then you could kind of freestyle that way and they can put arrows wherever they want.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.560
It would be like Saturday Night Fever, where you got the light up dance floor. Wouldn't that be cool?

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.560
Uh, I don't think I'm going to be somewhere else.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
More thoughts?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:26.560
That's just my two cents. I was thinking maybe Konami should just give us all free machines. Yeah, I'd like that.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.560
Do you hear us? Come on in and hook us up.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:02.560
In the meantime, this is for Dark Tetsuya in the chat room with some Jerry Halliwell from X2. Here you go.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.560
The street's the place to go

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560
Just a night for the first time

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.560
Just about as bad as

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.560
For the first time in history

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.560
God's got greatness

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560
It's greatness

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:51.560
Hallelujah, it's greatness

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.560
Amen, it's greatness

01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:21.680
Hallelujah, it's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men

01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:12.560
I think about you almost every day My mind is made up, I see you night and day

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:19.560
You're my obsession but I'll wait in line I'll pretend for till then that I'm doing fine

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:26.560
And I know that my feelings show, but I guess that's the way to let you know I'm in

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.560
What else can I do?

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:37.560
You are my fantasy, you are my energy

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.560
Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

01:32:44.560 --> 01:33:06.560
I was waiting for the moment in time And the moment came up to make you mine

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:13.560
I gotta have ya, I need you baby One look in your eyes and I gotta say

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:21.560
I know that my feelings don't, but I guess that's the way to let you know I need you

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560
What else can I do?

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.560
You are my fantasy

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:53.560
You are my fantasy, you are my energy Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.560
I don't know what to say

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:33.560
It's alright, I mean it's alright It's alright, more than that

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.160

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.580
Bye bye, baby

Get a new song

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.520
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.080
That's right

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.360
a new damn song lady anyway you are listening to orange lounge radio the

01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.840
very first show about 836 we're taking the show two hours by the way we're

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.560
gonna go to nine o'clock with this we think if the show is successful in the

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.120
future we'll try three hours but actually this is kind of it's kind of

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.000
an interesting situation because my co-host Jamie the lovely Jamie Summers

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.920
is going to be gone for the next two shows hey I'm gonna be in San Diego next

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:24.040
weekend and then I'm going to Anime Expo where I have enlisted aid to do interviews with

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.680
several of the people there in cosplays and general views and crap.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.760
And that's one thing we're going to bring you on future episodes of Orange Lounge. We

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.840
want to do interviews. Unfortunately we were going to be taking a trip yesterday over to

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.320
Sunnyvale because we knew a lot of people were going to be convening there and we wanted

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:42.560
to get some interviews with your favorite Bay Area personalities. But unfortunately

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.520
we weren't able to get out there because we, I had a job to do. I got work.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.600
So we couldn't make it out there.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.360
But we're going to try in future weeks to get out there.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.520
And if you have any event in NorCal that you'd like us to

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.360
come cover, drop us an email, OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.360
one word, OrangeLoungeRadio, at yahoo.com.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.920
And we'll try and make it.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.400
Even SoCal events we'll consider, but pretty much

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.640
anything further away than that.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.720
We don't really have a travel budget to accommodate yet.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.200
But if you want to give us money, we'll definitely think

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:09.640
about it.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.840
Money is good.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.040
Money is always wonderful.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.400
Money facilitates going places and doing things.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.400
Alright.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400
We do have some new subject matter.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.400
Okay, the last song we played just before coming out of that break

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.400
was LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix with Overblast,

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:33.400
which is something brand new in the new USA DDR Max that's going to be released.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.400
You remember the release date on that, Jamie?

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.400
I think they said they're going to do it in October.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.400
November.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.400
I think they said they're going to do it in October.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.360
Remember, this is the big, I don't know about you guys, I kind of had a hunch that this

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.920
is what was going to happen at E3, is that they were kind of keeping it a secret, that

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.800
there was going to be a new DDR release in the USA, and it turned out to be that they

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.520
are going to release Max in the USA, except it's not just the same song list, it's going

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:05.080
to be some old songs, like Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove is in it, and AM3P I believe

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.360
is returning as well.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.240
One of my friends who is not into Bimani, he was kind enough to videotape some of the

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:14.880
the game for me while he was at E3.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.920
The songs that I saw being played, I remember definitely that one of them was Insertion.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:20.920
Insertion, very cool.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.920
He said that it looked very clean, he was very impressed with it.

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:29.640
He got to hear a little bit of some talk about it, and on the tape it sounded like everybody's

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.460
favorite Konami rep, Jason Enos, in the background, giving some information.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:38.040
If I can find the tape, I'll definitely make sure that I have the segment encoded so that

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.880
everybody can see it, or try to do something like that for everyone.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.040
that's something we can put up on our website that would be pretty cool but it's kind of old stuff

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:51.360
and there's going to be new stuff and something that is going to be new is 20 new tracks to the

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.760
usa something has not been on any japanese release that's one of those songs right there we just

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.560
played for you over blast from beatmania fifth mix it's going to be a song in ddr max with steps and

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.560
all that fun stuff and we've been promised that we're going to have we're going to have some

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.520
license songs

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.760
in the new in the new DDR

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.240
let's hope so

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.640
and hopefully no more crappy remixes of AM3P

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.080
Hey, I like the remix of AM3P. You do? Well, the one in Max 2 is okay, but...

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:26.080
I like all of the remixes of AM3P. I don't like the remix of Superstar, but that's me.

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.600
But anyways, uh... Overblast. That song...

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.600
I could think that you'd pick some better ones.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.600
My opinion on this is that that song sucks ass.

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.600
And I wish that they had picked a better song.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.600
I mean, out of all the BeatMania songs in the world, why the hell do you pick that song?

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600
Seriously, that song sucks ass.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600
Pick, like, The Fall.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.600
I mean, pick, uh, N.O.F.I.A.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.600
I mean, there's a bunch of songs.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.600
Oh, hell, why not 3-2-1 Stars or something like that?

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.600
Just not that song.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:06.600
But hey, there's still 19 other songs that can be on there, so I still have my hopes up for this, so hopefully you'll be pleased.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.600
which pretty much eliminates all the top 40 songs.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.600
And there was much rejoicing, yay!

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.600
And no remixes of Let Them Move.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:36.600
God, no.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.600
It actually has been promised on one of those message boards.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.600
It was promised that there's no Let Them Move in any way, shape, or form.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.600
Finally, Konami comes to a good decision.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:49.600
Hooray for them.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600
So we'll keep bringing you the news on Max USA as we hear it

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.600
because it's going to be a big freaking deal, at least for us.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.600
Because they all say that DDR is dying in Japan.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.240
I don't know if there's any truth to that. We're not in Japan so we don't really know if it's dying or not

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.320
But that's what people are saying. So we'll see maybe it's dying there, but it's gonna be big here

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.660
So maybe they'll start focusing their efforts on what's starting to become a fad here

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.240
I would actually like you know in the whole respect that we're getting this

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.720
Max USA I would like to actually I'm probably not listening

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.260
But I would still like to give a big kudos to Jason Enos of Konami of America

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:28.260
for all of the hard work that's been put into us getting these games.

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:32.260
And anybody that happened to contribute, I know he's

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:36.260
kind of the contact person, he's the one that lurks on all the DDR boards and stuff

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.260
letting us know what's going on, but anybody that happens to be involved with that whole process deserves to thank you.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:44.260
Whoever woke up over there and said, let's bring DDR to the US

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.260
and let's bring them something new, not just recycled crap that they've already imported

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:52.260
because you know Konami's got to know about all these import machines. That's one thing that's completely

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:57.220
boggled me is you've got all these max 2 machines popping up everywhere it's the

01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.660
new thing and which is great because max 2 is the best mix they've done in a long

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:06.540
long time I would say most people wouldn't argue with me there but yet

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:10.300
Konami doesn't seem to be they have that you know this message is illegal for use

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.060
outside of Japan message that comes on the screen but yet they're not really

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.420
doing anything about it all these max 2 machines are still sitting there so well

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:26.420
We're not seeing a new release, at least that I've heard of, or that, you know, as far as an arcade release, I haven't seen any new releases come through.

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:37.420
I'm not sure exactly the reasoning behind that, but, you know, if they're not minding us getting those imports or they're not actively trying to stop it, let's not bring that up and not, you know...

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:41.140
It's very interesting to see that we're actually getting a brand new, you know, actually it

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:45.300
doesn't look like something recycled as Rob was putting it. And actually it's looking

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:49.660
like they're putting time in it. I mean, adding features like, you know, the 0.5 speed and

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.900
other things like that, it looks pretty good.

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:54.500
Although, 0.5 is kind of a weak feature. It's not really.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500
Yeah.

01:42:55.500 --> 01:43:00.580
How many people are going to, outside of Max 300, which is, in my mind, it's kind of a

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.780
crutch if you're going to use 0.5 speed to beat max 300.

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.420
What is the use of 0.5?

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:08.820
I don't know.

01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:10.660
Is it just to make things challenging, you think?

01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.940
I think it's to make things more challenging.

01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.260
One of the other things that I was looking at is hopefully

01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:17.900
this won't be as buggy as Conomex was.

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:21.360
I mean, you have problems with the fact that you can't take

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.740
the edits off of there, put them on Japanese machines

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:27.260
because they do have region coding inside actual edits

01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:30.060
also, which kind of sucked ass.

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.500
Hopefully, they'll fix that this time around.

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:35.500
Also, it's very interesting that in Europe, they're

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:39.140
getting Euromaxx, which is the brand new Euromixx there,

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.100
which is awesome.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:42.300
I wish we could get some of their songs over here.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:42.820
I wish.

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:44.460
Yeah, that would be neat.

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:46.200
Now, maybe this is Konami's little trick

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.900
is that they're going to actually take those songs they

01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.820
put in Euromixx and give them to us.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:51.180
Well, what's interesting, though,

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.540
is Euromaxx, they're also getting a machine for that.

01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.140
So maybe we can maybe be looking forward to DDR USA Maxx also.

01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:58.980
That would be nice.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:07.980
Very nice. Something that's being suggested in the chat room, a use for 0.5. Imagine my summer love maniac on 0.5 flat.

01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.980
That sounds like fun.

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:14.980
Yeah, so, stealth. That kind of eliminates, that eliminates, oh okay.

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:16.980
It's effectively stealth though.

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:22.980
It's effectively stealth. We're overhearing from the back of the room. Interesting suggestion there.

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:29.180
So, I don't know when we're going to hear more news on MacsUSA, but we'll give that

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.780
to you as soon as we hear any more information on that. One thing we have been hearing little

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.900
bits and pieces about, it's kind of a surprise to most people, was DDR PC. We're not talking

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.740
about the politically correct version of DDR where the heroin needle is removed. We're

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.300
talking about DDR for the personal computer on IBM. Have you heard about this?

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:49.060
Yes, I have. It's actually exclusive to Fry's and Outpost.com. You can go buy it there.

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:54.860
it's basically like 4th Mix on a PC. You've got 40 characters you can choose from, they're

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:59.180
gonna have more that you can actually download off their website at some point or another.

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:03.060
Right now it's been kinda iffy, they've been having it, you know, available, then coming

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:06.180
soon, available, coming soon, so I think they're having a little bit of trouble getting the

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.380
actual product out there, they're falling short on that. As far as the song list goes,

01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:15.180
you only have a few more that actually aren't available in any of the US versions, but pretty

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.260
Pretty much it's just a rehash of 4th Mix all over again.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:24.260
Actually, I was promised to be able to try this out pretty soon so I'll be able to maybe

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.420
give a review on that.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.940
That'll be nice next week maybe.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:31.380
But one of the features that was pretty interesting with this one was the fact that they're adding

01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:35.620
internet ranking just like 4th Mix and all the other Japanese releases had.

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:36.940
So this is pretty good.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:40.420
I don't know how well it's working out though because you have people playing on keyboards

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:42.420
and you have people playing on pads.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:48.080
So, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of, you know, inflating of people's actual ability

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.860
on there. But it looks pretty good if you haven't had any home versions.

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.740
I wonder if there's some kind of switch that would be able to show, hey, this person played

01:45:55.740 --> 01:46:00.260
on the pad or this person played on the keyboard. But even then, any hacker could probably wire

01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:04.380
a switch that would look like a pad. Well, actually, no, they do have such a thing

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:08.260
in Dance with Intensity. They have it where it actually detects whether it's keyboard

01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:13.580
were playing with a controller, but now still.

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:14.580
Probably.

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:18.060
If they just did a port of the PlayStation version, they probably didn't bother to go

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:19.460
that far with it.

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:25.100
But one thing, I remember before the break, Dave was out here talking about Fries, and

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:28.220
I know a lot of people on the west coast probably haven't seen this because they don't have

01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.980
Fries electronics outside of California too much.

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.620
They've got this really interesting setup for DDR.

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.940
Have any of you guys been over to Fries and seen their DDR setup?

01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.000
They've got the two Bads on the ground, and Fries is on a concrete floor, at least the

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.160
one we go to here in Sacramento, has a concrete floor on it, so it makes it pretty good to

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.680
dance on, so it kind of feels like the arcade pad.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.320
And then they've got like a big screen TV with DDR economics going on it, and every

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.800
time I've gone into Fries, I don't play DDR at Fries, it's just kind of weird, I don't

01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:00.660
want to be stared at by all those weird people, but I constantly see little kids in there

01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:05.320
playing on the thing, and I, those things, the Pads and games sell, it seems like I always

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:09.380
seem to look over and there's one set of parents, at least one set of parents, looking at the

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.460
games, thinking about buying them. So, Fry's has kind of been pushing it.

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:15.420
The people really, really, really want to go to GameStop.

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:20.380
Now, let's see. And I'd like to respond to Joe Mama in the chat room about editing images

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:25.360
and posting them. Actually, they have passwords. And basically, it's just a long string of

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.180
letters and numbers that they give you when you, you know, finish your songs to post up

01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:33.880
for the internet rankings. It doesn't have anything to do with screen captures or anything

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.680
like that. So there's really no way to cheat as far as Photoshopping goes. But I mean,

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.600
I'm sure there's ways you could probably find to, you know, crack the passwords and all

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.600
that kind of thing.

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.920
Just like, it sounds like it was going to be just like the ranking for 4th Mix and 5th

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.640
Mix and Max 2, everything you had on it where you had the long passwords. So it's pretty

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:56.100
much a lifted system from that. I wonder if there's, if it matches any other game though.

01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:00.160
Like if you were to play a song on another mix, it gives you the same code that PC would

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.160
give you.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:06.080
um... someone i believe we should make it apart to actually post somewhere

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.000
the actual there is internet ranking in max to unlock people don't know about it

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.120
if you play at three songs certain songs in a row

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.660
the luxury of password that they can post on the internet ranking site not

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:21.840
many people know that that's actually out there

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:27.160
perhaps i need to make this uh... future contest or something you know

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.560
uh... i don't know about that in the idea

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:34.240
captured japanese ur dominate japanese and people from a the barrier probably

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.520
dominating that uh... internet ranking let's there but

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.600
we could give it a try

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.880
there's also the only making and that there is uh...

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.960
somewhere and i think while those papers that page for the only ranking

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.500
yeah they'd be date

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.480
with the effort

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.940
to translate the internet ranking page in english so big shout out to them for

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:55.240
doing that that's a good favor to the whole community there

01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.360
And speaking of the community, I'd like to make a mention that if ever, you know, whenever

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.440
we're not hosting our show live, you can also check out a lot of the community action for

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:14.280
the SACBEMANI forums, located at www.sacbemani.com, that's S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.520
But we're definitely not going to be restricting the show to just the Sacramento community,

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.760
we want to get everybody involved, and I'm looking in the future at future shows to get

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:24.480
more guests involved in the show, hopefully some people will be able to come down from

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.120
the Bay Area and be in the show. And as I said, if we can't bring them to us, we're

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.560
going to go out to them. We're going to go out and tape at some tournaments and stuff

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.720
like that. So you might see us around. So come say hi and you can be on our show that

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:37.960
way. I'm going to take a really quick break here and then we're going to come back and

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.680
wrap things up. So I'm going to do a set of a couple 2DX songs and then we'll come right

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.680
back. We'll start it off with Rizlam here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.680
Why?

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680
Why?

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680
Why?

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680
Why?

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.680
Why?

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:22.680
Where's my fan when I need it? I wanted to do the TranDance.

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.680
The TranDance?

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.680
The StarMine TranDance.

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.680
That's actually the way I freestyle in 2DX.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.680
There's a little break in StarMine and I'll do a little spinny arm thing anyway.

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.680
Let me hear about that.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.680
Anyway, that was Ryu with StarMine before that.

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.680
Rick with Rizllm from 2DX.

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680
Rizllm gets you.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.680
And right now, they've been playing 2DX all night here in the broadcast room.

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.680
They're playing, what is this, Love Will?

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.680
That's a great 2DX song.

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:46.680
They will play that next week.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:51.260
next week. That's old school 2DX. Old school 2DX. We're getting ready to wrap up the show

01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:54.960
here, our first show. I'd like to thank everybody here for listening tonight. Thank you so much

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.160
for listening to our first show. You're listening to a little piece of Bomani history, I'd like

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:03.260
to thank. I'd like to thank me. I don't want to quit after the first week, so that's a

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:06.920
good sign that there's a little bit of life left here in the show. I was kind of worried

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:09.700
that, you know, this show would scare me off so bad I'd want to quit. But no, I think we're

01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:14.380
going to do this for quite a while, and look for us coming to an arcade near you soon.

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:19.660
One thing we do need to talk about though, we kind of touched on this briefly right before,

01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.980
right when we came back from the last segment, but Jamie you're going to be gone for a couple

01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:23.980
weeks now.

01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:27.180
You're the co-host of the show yet you're already abandoning us, but with good reason.

01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:31.380
I go to AX every year and I'm actually heading down a week early to go to San Diego to see

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:37.460
some friends and to hunt down our little youth coalition friend with a chainsaw.

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:42.620
I mean, with a recorder so I can maybe get an interview if the door's not slammed in

01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:43.620
my face.

01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:44.620
Right.

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:49.380
But really, I'm going to be at Anime Expo, I'm going to have recorders with me.

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.420
So all of you people who are going to be there, watch out for the girl with the wings.

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:55.420
Yes, I will be in costume.

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:57.060
I've seen Cosplay, it's great.

01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:59.060
Jamie's Cosplay costume is something else for this.

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:04.140
I will be either in costume as Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary, or Biken from Guilty

01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.980
Gear X, or Leona from King of Fighters.

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:12.860
So watch out for the short girl in the costume with the big black wings and the face paint.

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:17.460
Our website was finished today and your picture's on it so they can find it there.

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.460
Yes.

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:19.460
Exactly.

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:23.940
But the issue is, we're still doing the show every week, so we're going to have an open

01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:24.940
seat.

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.420
So, what do you think I should do about this predicament we're in?

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.100
Should I have them all fight over it?

01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.500
Should I make them all play 2DX to see who wins?

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:34.340
You could do like the clown car thing and pile them all in.

01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:35.340
What?

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.740
You could do the clown car thing and pile them all in.

01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:40.100
i think this is also the biggest seat is really cushy and i think that we should

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:42.020
just take caution tape around it

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:44.660
and people have to caution job to get it

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:48.660
yeah hurt hurt hurt hurt

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.460
or there we go we could do a limitation

01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:53.300
we get tricky about all we do

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:56.620
bahmani survivor

01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.100
that this scene will be filled by a random individual

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:05.420
but it will be temporarily filled because i don't let up my spidey hahaha

01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:09.260
maybe we'll do the money pop idol has a sound

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.060
your offer would be quiet

01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:14.180
you don't know what you're talking about

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:18.900
why you're not coming to hollywood you little bitch you all the weakest link

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:21.900
on the line that's pretty much across between the weakest link in star search

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:25.340
and this is why i don't like to see if you know where you know we should do

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.900
karaoke to see you know i think on i've been to karaoke

01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:32.620
i think maybe what we'll do is we'll just uh... come back next week and we'll

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:37.060
We'll kind of surprise everybody with who we're gonna have. Maybe we'll talk about it during the week.

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:43.060
I don't know, unless you have any... We will have a lovely surprise waiting for the crowd next week.

01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:46.740
Are you sure? No karaoke?

01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:49.340
And no karaoke? Maybe we'll do karaoke.

01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:53.440
Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you.

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.900
Irene lost. Anyway. Oh, no I didn't.

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:00.740
Or we could just settle this the good old D&D way. Where's my dice?

01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:06.500
uh... nobody chat but i know all of you know indeed he means to you

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.460
because all about the doors i mean

01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:11.900
well i think i started and i think it's just about that

01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:16.080
how we take a number of the one in six everyone takes a number don't say it on

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:16.880
the air

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.400
and they will have someone that in our chat room

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.760
at random number three one six

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.000
and i'll be your house

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.480
to be overnight

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.520
do that i need to straight over all of you all

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:36.520
six different numbers

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:41.820
and as we have a moment of silence to decide since the microphone can't pick

01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.880
up the people in the background

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:48.320
i think that we will have a random guest next week and we will surprise our

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.600
beautiful lovely listeners who we all love very much and they're trying not to

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.920
board a desk and if worse comes to worse we'll just pass the headset around

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.920
we'll let everybody sit in the chair for a segment does that sound like a fair option?

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.600
Now you're pimping out my chair.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.040
Yeah, we'll pimp out the chair.

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.240
So the new co-host for next week will be the Bahmani pimp.

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:05.960
How's that sound?

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.880
They'll be the whore.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.800
We've got to be the pimp to pimp out the chair.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.600
OK, so they'll be the Bahmani whores.

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.120
That's true.

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.600
You can get ejected out of the chair.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:14.840
You can get ejected out of the chair.

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.760
Just get something stupid, bam, and you're out of the chair.

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:17.240
And then we need to bring the gong.

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.200
I bring the button with a spring.

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:19.080
And if you piss me off, I'll just do it.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.480
It'll be like Russian roulette.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:21.480
It'd be like.

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.040
They'll fall through the floor.

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.520
Oh, that's Russian roulette.

01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:27.520
Russian Roulette.

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:31.320
It would be like that MTV show, Remote Control.

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.320
It'd be like Remote Control.

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:38.620
Now, see, there is a sign of being old when you remember when Remote Control was new.

01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:43.500
That means you're old if you remember Remote Control.

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:44.500
And you know what's funny enough?

01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:45.500
A winner is Irene.

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:48.560
What was the song they all sang when the person went through the wall?

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:53.400
Na na na na, na na na na, hey Harry.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.400
Party!

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.780
Anyway, I think we're going to bring this show to a close now.

01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:01.200
Thank you everybody for listening.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.600
Please join us next week again at 7 o'clock.

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.260
We're going to rebroadcast this show sometime through the week.

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.100
I just haven't figured out a good time yet.

01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:10.900
So if there's a part you missed, you can hear it later.

01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:15.860
But do send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:16.880
All one word.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:21.040
And let us know what songs you want to hear through the week.

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.380
And yeah, all your suggestions and stuff.

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.880
All your suggestions are below the list.

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:27.400
Exactly.

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.600
For great justice.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.120
All right.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.080
So we're going to end the show now.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.760
Thank you to everybody for listening.

01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.480
And we will see you next week on the Orange Lounge.

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:39.000
Any final thoughts, Jamie?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.600
Be excellent to each other.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.720
Party on, dude.

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:49.680
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
