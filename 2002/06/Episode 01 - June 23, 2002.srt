[SPEAKER_07]: You have no morals, darling.

9
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun in a scorching case of herpes.

10
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:02,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Kiss my great news.

00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too!

14
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:08,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Fucker, yeah?

15
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on it.

16
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Loser.

17
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:11,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame!

18
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the size of my face.

19
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:22,949
[SPEAKER_05]: From the state of California, in the great nation of the USA, on the planet Earth, it is Orange Lounge Radio.

20
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:30,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You're tuned in to Bomani's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

21
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,122
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me better as Sky.

22
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:50,124
[SPEAKER_04]: With me, as always, is a lovely co-host who has 12 lovely vanilla cans, might I add.

24
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie Summers.

25
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:53,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

26
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bill of coke.

27
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:55,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crack.

28
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,407
[SPEAKER_04]: This is episode number one for June 23rd, 2002.

29
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:02,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a whole lot of people in studio.

30
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, studio.

31
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

32
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

33
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other first things you want to say, Jamie?

34
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, hi.

35
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:09,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

36
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,186
[SPEAKER_04]: That works for me.

37
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,787
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty then, we'll be right back.

38
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:18,149
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be talking about the first show and lots of other firsts and whatever the hell else we feel like.

39
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You can view our webcam on our website at http://orangelounge.skie.cx Join us in our chat room at Channel Pound Orange Lounge on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net We'll be giving that out for the rest of the show, won't we, Jamie?

40
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, quite often.

41
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:37,937
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty then.

42
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:42,120
[SPEAKER_04]: For the very first break song, I'm going to play something for the Fantasia album.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,322
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Vanessa May with Destiny.

44
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:46,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Vanessa May at Freaky Rocks.

45
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:47,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't it, Jamie?

46
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanessa May Owens.

47
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

48
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,927
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my destiny.

49
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,103
Thank you for watching!

50
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,277
Thanks for watching!

51
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:45,132
I met you when you were sleeping

52
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:48,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby, no, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, no, nobody's love, yeah, baby Bye-bye, baby balloon Bye-bye, baby balloon

53
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitch, get a new song!

54
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,548
[SPEAKER_17]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

55
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Brad's idea.

56
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,138
[SPEAKER_06]: He just claimed it.

57
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all Brad's idea.

58
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:36,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your fault.

59
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to blame somebody for this talk show train wreck, just blame Brad.

60
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

61
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:48,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I think the idea came to us, what, probably back in January or February?

62
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:54,192
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the first time you guessed it on the other show, Under Sedation Live, that we participate in?

63
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in January or so, wasn't it?

64
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:57,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was this year.

65
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was probably back in January.

66
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:02,138
[SPEAKER_06]: It was after I got my new computer, so that had to have been in January.

67
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:18,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when Jamie was on the first Under Sedation Live that she was on, which is another show that I co-host, you can visit that website at http://undersedationlive.org or it's actually one of our friends on the playlist, or on the Live 365 site.

68
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:24,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go to Live 365 and take a look at our fellow broadcasters, we have the Under Sedation Live listed there.

69
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the show that I co-host on Saturday night.

70
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd also like to say, if Travis happens to be out there listening tonight,

71
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate all the help, and this drink's for you.

72
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,491
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

73
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,673
[SPEAKER_04]: That relates to last night's show, don't worry about it.

74
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So, probably back when Jamie hosted this show in January, we thought, you know, we ought to do a Bomani Talk thing for Bomani.

75
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:55,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not, you know, because Under Station Live kind of...

76
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,950
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

77
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:26,923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:45,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Two game rooms going.

79
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:46,578
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got one in the back.

80
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:55,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the webcam on our website, http://orangelounge.sky.cx, you can see on the webcam there's some people.

81
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're playing Max in there right now.

82
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:57,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

83
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

84
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:58,941
[SPEAKER_04]: In the other room.

85
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:03,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in here we've got Keys Pounding, which you can probably hear because we've got Brad in here playing some 2DX.

86
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yell something to the people out at home, Brad.

87
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

88
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to talk into the mic.

89
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:43,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

90
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,813
Sorry.

91
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:54,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of firsts, since it is the first show, we are kind of expecting that there's going to be a lot of issues tonight, so please bear with us throughout all the technical difficulties and everything else going on.

92
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the communal microphone over here.

93
00:11:56,538 --> 00:12:04,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the communal microphone that everybody's going to have to talk into, which Irene has pretty much parked herself near, so I think we'll know who we'll be hearing from most of the night over there.

94
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:13,704
[SPEAKER_04]: First experiences with Bimani, because it's kind of something you see once, you play it once, and then you're pretty much stuck with it for the rest of your life.

95
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're listening to this program.

96
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:25,488
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've actually gone out of your way to tune into a Bimani-focused radio program, you're obviously a very ill person who's come down with a Bimani flu.

97
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you've succumbed to my threats.

98
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,229
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, they're not dorks.

99
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:32,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

100
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you?

101
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,290
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

102
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:39,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jamie, what was your very first Bomani experience?

103
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:47,830
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the first time you... I know you, out of probably most people here, I'm not sure because we haven't really compared everybody's notes yet, but out of most people here, you were probably the very first person to play DDR and all that.

104
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,492
[SPEAKER_06]: To go way back in time, let's go to 1999.

105
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:58,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Around February or March, I first heard of Beatmania and thought, oh, that looks kind of dorky.

106
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:04,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually had Beatmania 98 on my computer, so that was my ever first Beatmania experience.

107
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, how many of us started with BM98?

108
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:07,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise your hand.

109
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be me and Brad.

110
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:12,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I went to Anime Expo.

111
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I had heard of Dance Dance Revolution and said, that game looks stupid.

112
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:16,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go play Best to Move.

113
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was in a Best to Move 2 tournament at AX1999.

114
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:25,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Spent like an hour owning everybody before I got a faulty controller.

115
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:31,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went over and was looking at these people because I heard Shake Your Booty playing.

116
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was DDR Second Mix.

117
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my first DDR.

118
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't actually really play it.

119
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:39,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I hit like 2000.

120
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:44,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw the first one on PlayStation and got hooked then.

121
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:45,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I borrowed my friend's game.

122
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't pass Butterfly.

123
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:52,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I was asleep one night, woke up the next morning, and just, like, passed Butterfly at random.

124
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:55,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I didn't see my first DVR machine until AX2000.

125
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:56,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the third mix.

126
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:04,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It was $2 a game, and, well, I dished out $2 a game, slept in the room, and there went my addiction.

127
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started off with the Dreamcast, and nobody can say anything.

128
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:08,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega owns.

129
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore.

130
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't bite me.

131
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, Sink is making games for the GameCube.

132
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:20,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Their third-party stuff is looking pretty good, so I've got to give them some credit.

133
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:21,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them lots of credit.

134
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:30,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, DDR Club on the Dreamcast is much better than the PlayStation version because they had to split the PlayStation version into two CDs, and that kind of sucks.

135
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:34,200
[SPEAKER_04]: But on Dreamcast, it's all in one nice, shiny little package.

136
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,962
[SPEAKER_04]: My first DDR experience was, and funny enough, you know, the show that this is kind of spun off of is a Rocky Horror themed show.

137
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:45,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually first discovered DDR at a Rocky Horror convention.

138
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:48,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was, hell, I don't even know, I think it was 2000.

139
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:48,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

140
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:50,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting so old.

141
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:59,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in October of 2000, we were at a convention in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel, and they were showing the movie Friday and Saturday night.

142
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:04,016
[SPEAKER_04]: But we decided, you know what, once a week's enough, so we're not going to go Friday night.

143
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:08,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to go out to the arcade, and we're just going to play games, because that's what we want to do.

144
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one of those big dancing machines with the flashing seizure lights, and we all wanted to play it.

145
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:15,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That was your first night too, wasn't it?

146
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

147
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you wish to add about... About DDR?

148
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we play our first game together?

149
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:28,936
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it was just me by myself first, because you guys were pussy.

150
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:29,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

151
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:35,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, we're white, we can't play this, let the Asian do it first, and then we'll look cool, you know, after.

152
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:36,079
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

153
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:36,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

154
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,400
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um...

155
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were at Circus Circus, and what was it, a 1.5?

156
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the old USA Machine.

157
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, I know.

158
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I distinctly remember the song Butterfly.

159
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, shut up.

160
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody played it.

161
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:53,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember it was the spinning discs that you can choose from instead of the song list.

162
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that much.

163
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And we fucking sucked.

164
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:56,878
[SPEAKER_04]: We were terrible.

165
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember passing.

166
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,402
[SPEAKER_04]: We passed the first song.

167
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And didn't I pass Boom Boom Dollar the first time?

168
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:11,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you passed the second song and I was like sleeping by then because I failed like the first three steps.

169
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:15,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to take this moment to give Irene an inside joke and then the maid.

170
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:17,909
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best joke ever.

171
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Shush, Brad.

172
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:22,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, this show's going to suck.

173
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:23,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

174
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:37,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So after that, we came back home to Sacramento, land of nothingness, and we thought that was pretty much it, that was the only time we were going to play DDR, and then we found that Roseville Golf Land...

175
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:45,560
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up getting its own DDR machine sometime in, I think, what, December of 2000?

176
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:49,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They picked up the Super Elite USA mix.

177
00:16:49,682 --> 00:17:03,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember it being toward the end of the summer, because I had been playing at Country Club Lanes, the evil place, and then I heard, hey, there's a USA machine over at Roosevelt Golf Land, went over there, and that's when I met lots of people.

178
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Danielle first and through her I met Brad.

179
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:14,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I met a bunch of people at Milpitas Golf Land on that first road trip to find Parapara.

180
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: With the sacramenstrals.

181
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the sacramenstrals.

182
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:22,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We, you know, suck so bad we bleed, I guess.

183
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't die.

184
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dear God.

185
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:27,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

186
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,366
[SPEAKER_13]: We suck so bad we bleed.

187
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else in the room care to share their first Bimani story?

188
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're really desperate for material right now.

189
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everyone's convinced we're never going to fill a two-hour show of Bimani Talks.

190
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,510
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to prove them wrong, even if we have to bullshit for just two hours.

191
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,630
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got the microphone.

192
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody runs.

193
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, a.k.a.

194
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, would like to share a story.

195
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

196
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:52,033
[SPEAKER_02]: My first experience with Bimani, I'd have to say it started back, I believe it was the year 2000, with...

197
00:17:54,614 --> 00:18:23,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantomacon, I saw someone playing 5 key Beatmania 2nd Mix and actually it was really cool, what song that hooked me was the theme for Metal Gear Solid and from there I went and bought everything for Beatmania played it a couple times and put it away and then next year comes around, 2001 and I saw them playing DDR 4th Mix which was really awesome

198
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:24,825
[SPEAKER_02]: That game I really got into.

199
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:31,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I actually got a chance to play it first time in Lake Tahoe and I found out I had no rhythm whatsoever.

200
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I sort of looked like

201
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:37,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Martin and The Jerk

202
00:18:54,468 --> 00:19:15,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, you know, flash forward back to about a year ago, I come to find out after I moved from El Dorado Hills to Orangeville that Roseville's got, you know, 4th and a USA machine, and I had, during the time, picked up also my own home version of 4th and 3rd with two pads, and I'd been practicing on Pink Dinosaur and La Senorita.

203
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:16,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.

204
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:17,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

205
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those.

206
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:24,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so then I started playing at Roseville constantly.

207
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do nine hours a weekend and actually I think I still do about nine hours a week.

208
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:31,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me to cut you off for a minute.

209
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:33,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, Brad, Brad, yeah.

210
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is banned in this house.

211
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not play 250 BPM in this house.

212
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:42,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in this house has nightmares about that freaking crack baby in the video.

213
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:46,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to cut you off.

214
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

215
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:47,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

216
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:52,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, nine hours a week for a whole year so far.

217
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, woo!

218
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else want to share their first story?

219
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, I'd love to hear your story.

220
00:19:59,072 --> 00:19:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

221
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:00,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the controller down.

222
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:00,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

223
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:02,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's somebody.

224
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And the doorbell rings.

225
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,876
[SPEAKER_06]: More victims!

226
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,317
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your life.

227
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:10,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Or this is our show.

228
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:19,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, before we go on to whoever our guest is, I actually would like to make a mention.

229
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you?

230
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:20,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

231
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:20,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

232
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,954
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a general shout out.

233
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:28,938
[SPEAKER_06]: This goes to DDR Freak Radio, all the other Bimani radio stations out there.

234
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys own and keep doing it because we need to keep Bimani on the air and keep everything alive too.

235
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, we need to keep doing shit like Bomani X Radio, all those other radio stations out there.

236
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:40,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else is broadcasting?

237
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a user on DDR Freak who has their own station.

238
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,463
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably about 10 different stations.

239
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:48,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You put Bomani into live365.com, you're going to get about 10 different stations that come up.

240
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's commotion going on at the door there.

241
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:52,246
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

242
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Paul's here.

243
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Paul?

244
00:20:55,007 --> 00:21:05,974
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give a shout out to all those other Bomani stations out there, because especially, if you might have heard this past week, I believe it was Thursday, the new royalty rates for internet radio came down.

245
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:12,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to have to pay 7 cents for every song heard by 1,000 listeners.

246
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, this station will never, ever, ever have 1,000 listeners.

247
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope.

248
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does, we have ways to control that.

249
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it retroactive too?

250
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:38,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

251
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:56,571
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole Bomani thing, I'm sure since we're pretty much whoring out Bomani, they really don't give a crap what we're doing.

252
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:58,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So they probably wouldn't come after us.

253
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:05,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, for everybody else out there, for all the other shows out there, this is a really stupid thing that they're trying to do.

254
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:07,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just trying to charge us for every little thing we do.

255
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:09,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not going to take it!

256
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,040
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two roots to that.

257
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,201
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is greed.

258
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:20,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two is called having something crawl up your ass and die.

259
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:22,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

260
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:23,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That happened to me Tuesday.

261
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even care about people.

262
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:26,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's anal greed.

263
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,681
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't sound right.

264
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Like anal spider?

265
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like anal spider.

266
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But anal spider is cool because they do beat mania stuff.

267
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my anal spider noise.

268
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:40,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that again.

269
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

270
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:46,287
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not quite what I remember from the song.

271
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Macho Gang?

272
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have to get on that base of the...

273
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: A penny just stuck to me, isn't that crazy?

274
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,977
[SPEAKER_04]: As Rob goes off on another tangent.

275
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:00,599
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's the dying giraffe sound from the South Park movie.

276
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:01,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Paul's here.

277
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, say hi.

278
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Give Paul the microphone.

279
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:04,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the adults have the show.

280
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:16,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't make out with the microphone.

281
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:20,515
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, don't perform sexual acts on the microphone.

282
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:37,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, if we've gone how many months now of playing Bomani and never shutting up about it, like the afternoon.

283
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:42,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say I don't have a life outside of Bomani because I try to.

284
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:45,905
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not everything.

285
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: But we certainly can fill up two hours of a show.

286
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: If we spent 15 minutes on each game alone, that would be two hours or more.

287
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two hours a week that we can fill.

288
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:54,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about firsts.

289
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:58,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to know everybody's first experience with Bimani and why they're so addicted.

290
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us how you lost your Bimani virginity.

291
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,789
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's the heroin needles that shoot out when you do a good job, or what?

292
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul, that was a question to you.

293
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, tell us about your first experience.

294
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:15,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I started out with DDR and it just...

295
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:16,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my goodness!

296
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,156
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't believe it!

297
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:18,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything's ruined!

298
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:45,598
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

299
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:49,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's a little number I tossed off recently at the kettlebell.

300
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not singing with it this time.

301
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't it all be nice to have a penis?

302
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:56,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it frightfully good to have a dog?

303
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:23,619
[SPEAKER_12]: It's well to have a stiffy, it's divine to own a dick From the tiniest little tadger to the world's biggest prick So three chows for your Willy or John Thomas Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake

304
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:28,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your party, or your cock.

305
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,332
[SPEAKER_12]: You can wrap it up in ribbons, you can slip it in your sock.

306
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:34,955
[SPEAKER_12]: But don't take it out in public, or they will stick you in the dock.

307
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:38,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And you won't become a bad little big woman.

308
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:43,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say I don't have enough sound effects to fill up a show or you're going to get subjected to crap like that for two hours.

309
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:47,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Travis' collection of... No, I got these on my very own thing.

310
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey.

311
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's a big boy now.

312
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:54,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie was up until 4 a.m.

313
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,117
[SPEAKER_06]: downloading this stuff.

314
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:57,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Brad, what?

315
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,218
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we know?

316
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:59,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us what we know.

317
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what should be in Beatmania?

318
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:01,819
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

319
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Our good friend Wesley Willis.

320
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember Wesley Willis.

321
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do remember Wesley Willis.

322
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:08,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any Wesley Willis?

323
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Wesley Willis.

324
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to play Wesley Willis right now.

325
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

326
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe at the end of the show I'll play Wesley Willis.

327
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:14,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

328
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,463
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be the end credits, though, right?

329
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:16,663
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

330
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:17,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

331
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:17,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

332
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:19,144
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

333
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dear God.

334
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:21,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time for a break.

335
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:21,885
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll stop talking now.

336
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back for the break, we'll talk about... Why don't we talk about... Everybody in the community is talking about this this week.

337
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Solo 2000.

338
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it safe for the children?

339
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't anybody thinking of the children when we come back?

340
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,240
Thanks for watching!

341
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,585
[SPEAKER_05]: A dream, that is real

342
00:29:55,848 --> 00:30:02,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it always the same old thing?

343
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:04,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Wanna be a man, yeah, you're playing games.

344
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:07,396
[SPEAKER_08]: If you gotta kid act like your father, the baby ain't yours, then hey, why?

345
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.

346
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:36,926
[SPEAKER_16]: We think we figured it out.

347
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:37,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio

348
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:58,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the lovely karaoke stylings of me there in that little diddy one-hit wonder.

349
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, what?

350
00:31:59,141 --> 00:31:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have your autograph?

351
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:00,543
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

352
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:01,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

353
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:02,385
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rob!

354
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:04,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Rob!

355
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:05,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

356
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:07,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me your moves!

357
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I just showed him, now he's not going to talk for the next half hour.

358
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're really R-rated, you know, we've had nudity on here now.

359
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:18,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our little hippie... I don't know if anyone picked that up.

360
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our little hippie hoppy set there.

361
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Our fresh set.

362
00:32:22,553 --> 00:32:23,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Our booty fresh.

363
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:24,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Our booty fresh set.

364
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Brought to you by... Cracker, starting it off from 2DX.

365
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:34,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two songs from DDR, solo 2000s, a six panel version of DDR, Dream a Dream by Captain Jack, the booty mix.

366
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:35,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Who that is?

367
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: My Baby Mama by Anna Kett, finishing that off DDR Solo 2000, most people really don't give a shit about Solo 2000 anymore Solo sucks anyway Exactly, ever since that infamous tournament, that's kind of become the catchphrase How did that happen anyway?

368
00:32:49,732 --> 00:33:01,360
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably know more about the story behind Solo sucks anyway than I do Because I'm sure a lot of people would like to know why, whenever they talk about Solo Somebody always jumps into the thread and goes, Solo sucks anyway I think it resulted from a failed routine

369
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the entire story.

370
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:23,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so that's what this game is about.

371
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:29,713
[SPEAKER_04]: But DDR Solo, in the news around the community this week, this has everybody talking about something.

372
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:32,395
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the point where I let my head into my hand.

373
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:33,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about the story.

374
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:34,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read this article here.

375
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:42,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from the San Diego Union Tribune, and it's by Brian E. Clark from the San Diego Union Tribune here.

376
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:43,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

377
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:53,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It talks about the Poway Bowling Alley Arcade replaces a game after used protests the images in the game.

378
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Jennifer Stoethan couldn't believe her eyes.

379
00:33:56,677 --> 00:34:06,767
[SPEAKER_04]: There on the Dance Dance Revolution machine, a video game immensely popular with preteens and teens were images of drugs, alcohol, and a scantily clad nurse riding up and down on a syringe.

380
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:12,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I was appalled to see that stuff flashing on the screen, said the 17-year-old Stofan.

381
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:18,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And she first saw the pictures way back in March on the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the Poway Fun Ball.

382
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:23,400
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, I'm a teenager, but I've seen five-year-olds playing this game.

383
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,902
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I'm concerned, those images are totally unnecessary.

384
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:32,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they need to have pictures with rows of pills, cocktails, ecstasy, and a syringe?

385
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:35,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'd like to know how that girl knew that the pills were ecstasy.

386
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:40,107
[SPEAKER_06]: He was appalled, yet excited.

387
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,729
[SPEAKER_03]: She's probably seen five-year-olds naked, too.

388
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

389
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about what she did.

390
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:56,916
[SPEAKER_04]: She basically documented pictures, contacted the company that placed the game in the bowling alley, and convinced the arcade owner to replace the machine.

391
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know with what.

392
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:01,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be really, really funny.

393
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be really funny if it was Humpahorse.

394
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:07,753
[SPEAKER_06]: That Namco horsey game.

395
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:07,753
2002.

396
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Furlong.

397
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So she basically got her way.

398
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,139
[SPEAKER_04]: She whined, bitched, and moaned.

399
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:19,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And we shouldn't just say her because obviously she got other people in on this too.

400
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:20,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Her little coalition.

401
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:25,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Which happens to share a name with a very big lesbian, gay, bisexual coalition group.

402
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,509
[SPEAKER_04]: The Youth Advocacy Coalition or whatever.

403
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of a funny side note anyway.

404
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Who probably lesbians and gays wouldn't really care about.

405
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,077
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR, Solo 2000, they'd probably find it funny.

406
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It should also be noted that Solo 2000, just like that movie The Last Starfighter, recruits people for the Army of Satan.

407
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's widely known knowledge.

408
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:46,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I signed up just last week!

409
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:52,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think a lesbian would have a problem with looking at a nurse riding on a syringe.

410
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.

411
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so they go on to gloat.

412
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel really good about what we were able to accomplish.

413
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And she graduated from high school.

414
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a high school graduate.

415
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:03,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for her.

416
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:07,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's going to study film at San Jose State University.

417
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:11,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So I imagine her next target will probably be in San Jose somewhere.

418
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:18,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Little kids or even teens don't need to see that stuff, and we were happy the business people we dealt with agreed with us too.

419
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So the moral of the story, if you bitch and moan and you threaten to sue, you'll get your way.

420
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:25,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch out, Sunnyvale.

421
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,706
[SPEAKER_04]: She's coming for you.

422
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:30,348
[SPEAKER_06]: She's protesting these images, yet she's going to be a film student.

423
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that how, like, you know, independent filmmakers, like, win?

424
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,332
[SPEAKER_06]: By being provocative.

425
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:38,492
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we know she's not going...

426
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gonna get Sundance shut down for showing titties.

427
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the nudity is artistic, it's okay.

428
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:51,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Kate Winslet in Titanic, that was artistic nudity.

429
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ugly nudity also, but it was, you know, anyway.

430
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:08,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It was... That's the whole thing, is that, you know, this particular organization... See, I don't get, it's not just this organization, it's any organization who decides that there's something out there that they don't like.

431
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:09,650
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

432
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:40,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, there's just so much positive about it and they have to focus on all the negativity so a lot of people have to lose out because something crawled up their ass and died.

433
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:45,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till Solo 2004 comes out with aborted fetuses and crack whores in the background.

434
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:46,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

435
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be the devil's advocate?

436
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, Irene, you want to be the devil's advocate?

437
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here and tie him to the microphone.

438
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,643
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to hear this from the other perspective.

439
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have loved to have gotten an interview with this person but I was too lazy so we'll maybe get one next week.

440
00:37:59,627 --> 00:37:59,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

441
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what was I going to say?

442
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be devil's advocate.

443
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:04,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

444
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a thought.

445
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:06,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

446
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you said that just because a band of people got together and protested against something means that, you know, they get their way.

447
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:22,068
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's kind of like if there was a group of murderers out there.

448
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:27,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course that's going to be sickening to some people and they're going to band together and kind of complain about these murderers.

449
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:30,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't say that I fully agree with

450
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:34,869
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about people that band together and complain about things?

451
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, sometimes it's for good.

452
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this particular instance, I don't feel so strongly about it.

453
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:40,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's wrong.

454
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:44,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's not say everyone that does that is terrible.

455
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:46,274
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

456
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi there.

457
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guess what, Rob?

458
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:51,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat my ass.

459
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, any comments?

460
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:56,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I talking?

461
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm talking like Waylon.

462
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's okay.

463
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Any comments?

464
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very good point you're making.

465
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,062
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong!

466
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that part of it just has to do with the fact that people are generally closed-minded.

467
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:19,827
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't willing to accept an idea that might be different than their own.

468
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:26,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're going to stick to that one idea and think that everybody has to adhere to it.

469
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Where, you know, apparently we disagree.

470
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:31,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's obvious because we like DVR.

471
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:35,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, not just with that situation, but with a ton of situations in the world.

472
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:40,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It's intolerance and just generally being closed-minded.

473
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:44,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm going to be the devil's advocate for the devil's advocate.

474
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

475
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to make another point.

476
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to fill this damn show somehow.

477
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:48,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

478
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:49,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just make this the Irene show.

479
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:55,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about the people that were, you know, the kind of people that I can see being against is like the Nazis.

480
00:39:57,308 --> 00:40:00,670
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at one time people thought the Nazis were cool.

481
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody here necessarily thought the Nazis were cool.

482
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:07,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Jewish people ever thought the Nazis were very cool.

483
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:12,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because people were shocked.

484
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another example of the sheep mentality I'm often fond of bringing up.

485
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and you know, I think Adolf Hitler just had some insecurities, because he only had one testicle.

486
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:26,949
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's just like, fuck you all, I'm just going to kill everyone because I have one testicle.

487
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:29,091
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you know he had one testicle?

488
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:30,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't you like to know?

489
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:39,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been reported from unknown sources because I just read a bunch of books and shut up.

490
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Nerd.

491
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:40,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You can read.

492
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:41,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

493
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,825
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I'm not a geep like Paul.

494
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:45,245
[SPEAKER_06]: A geep?

495
00:40:45,285 --> 00:40:46,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he has a geep on his shirt.

496
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:52,008
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so, I mean, I guess it just depends on the situation, you know.

497
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:53,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It's circumstantial.

498
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:59,051
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have beliefs... Oh, that's my cue.

499
00:40:59,471 --> 00:40:59,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go now.

500
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

501
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:03,992
[SPEAKER_06]: You were saying, if you have beliefs, continue.

502
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:04,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't know.

503
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The giraffe noise threw me off.

504
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:10,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you have beliefs... Good point.

505
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:12,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, thanks, thanks.

506
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:36,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the general moral of that is even though there are people who do occasionally win to take away things, not necessarily take away things that we enjoy, but just to inflict their closed-minded opinion on the masses, there should always be the people who are willing to stand against that, who are willing to say something, you know, we don't think this is right.

507
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no right to censor our lives.

508
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I also, one last thing, like

509
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:45,071
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't like it so much, why don't they just not go there?

510
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my whole opinion.

511
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why ruin the party for everybody else just because you have a problem with it?

512
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:53,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody is forcing you to play this game.

513
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:58,860
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everyone's so hip on, like, let's, you know, everyone puts disclaimers on things and stuff, you know?

514
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And why is it that this particular incident, they have to take away our fun?

515
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:05,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

516
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:07,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

517
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:08,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go ahead.

518
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:11,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's probably what the situation is for this one.

519
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you said it's at a bowling alley.

520
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm guessing it's probably someone that's part of a league or a bowling league or something like that that sees a stupid game playing in the background when they're waiting between frames to bowl.

521
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowling for God.

522
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:27,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Christian bowling.

523
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:28,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Highway to pins to heaven.

524
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so probably it's just someone with nothing better to do than complain about something if it wasn't, you know...

525
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:40,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Arguing against people killing whales or small animals or something like that.

526
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Children.

527
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:41,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Children.

528
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:43,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Abortion or whatever.

529
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they would have picked on something else.

530
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:49,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a starter to other things to debate about.

531
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:58,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think it's probably no big deal, but like I've read on the responses for these, that not really anyone's worried about it.

532
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:01,128
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really think it's going to go too far, and I probably agree with them.

533
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:07,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why the bowling alley owner decided to get rid of the game in the first place.

534
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:10,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It must not have been making him any money or something.

535
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,089
[SPEAKER_04]: There must be other factors involved.

536
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,570
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing I see, let me be the extremist here for a second.

537
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

538
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:26,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on that one instance, that machine getting taken out is doing more damage to a larger amount of people than...

539
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:31,780
[SPEAKER_03]: The images on the machine are doing to the little kids, I believe.

540
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:40,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's be an extremist here and say that what if all the machines eventually do get taken out because this does go way too far, which I doubt it will.

541
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:47,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's definitely doing even more damage to a larger amount of people than the little images of syringes and naked women.

542
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:49,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuckin' A!

543
00:43:49,163 --> 00:43:54,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You see more of that kind of stuff on TV anyway than you do on the frickin' machines and arcades.

544
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside at the bowling alleys, all the parents are drunk anyway, so who gives a shit?

545
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, they don't want to watch their own kids, so they put something that has syringes and stuff to baby for their kids.

546
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:15,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other thing I can think of why the manager would agree with something is if it's supposed to be a family environment and enough families banded together and said this is not the type of environment we want our children around.

547
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:16,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Mormon Bowl.

548
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Their protests might have actually had some credence with the manager.

549
00:44:21,974 --> 00:44:27,818
[SPEAKER_06]: But even so, I mean, first of all, they stand to lose money because I know for a fact DVR machines make a ton of money.

550
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, from having worked at three different arcades...

551
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that they make those rating stickers.

552
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:38,266
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how you have your ratings on your video games to have at home?

553
00:44:38,786 --> 00:44:41,228
[SPEAKER_06]: They have those rating stickers for arcade machines.

554
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:44,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Corporately owned arcades are actually required to have them.

555
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:46,753
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I know Namco did.

556
00:44:47,193 --> 00:44:53,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too sure about Gotham, but I know that most of them do.

557
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:56,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally went through and put a lot of those stickers on machines.

558
00:44:56,981 --> 00:45:03,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So that any parent who had their child with them could look at the machine, look at the rating, and see if that's really something they wanted their kid to play.

559
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:10,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, parents don't want to watch their children themselves and do their job, so they let the arcades babysit their children for them.

560
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the thing I notice at Golf Land all the time.

561
00:45:15,934 --> 00:45:17,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents bring their kids there.

562
00:45:18,636 --> 00:45:19,496
[SPEAKER_04]: and then just turn them loose.

563
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: They run around everywhere.

564
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:26,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They're stomping on all sorts of machines and shooting things.

565
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:32,019
[SPEAKER_04]: What's worst of all is that when we're playing on DDR, they start coming and playing with us.

566
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like eight people playing on the machine at once because all these little kids want to jump on the arrows because, oh, shiny thing.

567
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,021
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting into my territory here.

568
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:38,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, I know.

569
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:44,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But, why don't these parents watch the kids when they drop them off here?

570
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:52,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you would be able to take an active role in what they're playing, because if you just let your kids turn loose, there is way worse arcade games out there besides DDR.

571
00:45:52,770 --> 00:46:00,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What if this bowling alley, I would like to know if this bowling alley has like a police 911 machine, where you're shooting people and there's...

572
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost Drogas and everything.

573
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:05,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say something.

574
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we just band together and say, we're offended by these god people.

575
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:11,578
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need a derby owners club.

576
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:12,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's not politically correct.

577
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And race horses all day and teach good horse raising values.

578
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,180
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unconstitutional.

579
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I say we just screw DDR and we all get a Neopet.

580
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:20,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

581
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:23,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want a Neopet.

582
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:25,023
[SPEAKER_03]: My Neopet wasn't fed.

583
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw it at you now.

584
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

585
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're weird.

586
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Malnourished Neopet.

587
00:46:30,545 --> 00:46:31,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, Rob.

588
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:32,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yes?

589
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:36,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about, we should, you know, definitely have my rant.

590
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:38,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll get to your rant after the next break.

591
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:43,983
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I was going to make a point and I just forgot it.

592
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:46,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I won't make a point.

593
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,425
[SPEAKER_04]: The points at Cal Expo.

594
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think is going to happen after this?

595
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:49,946
[SPEAKER_04]: After what?

596
00:46:49,966 --> 00:46:52,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that more machines are going to get taken out from other places?

597
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:53,528
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

598
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:59,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this person said they're going to go on to DDR Freak, which is probably the most well-known DDR site that's out there.

599
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Go look at their machine locations page and start hitting every Solo 2000 machine out there.

600
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:05,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see how many were on there?

601
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

602
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:10,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, honestly, the owners of these places...

603
00:47:10,922 --> 00:47:15,084
[SPEAKER_06]: They've had them long enough to know, you know, what's going on in the game.

604
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: They've had them long enough to know the kind of content is inside.

605
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:23,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and there's, you know, I don't, I think they would have taken them out by now.

606
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,231
[SPEAKER_06]: If they really felt passionately about that.

607
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:27,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And here comes Brad.

608
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:29,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's Matt, he hasn't been here.

609
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

610
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:35,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think what's going to happen is if people are going to call up these establishments with the Solo 2000 machines,

611
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just going to get laughed at because these people are going to be like, yeah, I'm just going to take this machine that I paid a couple grand for and just get rid of it because you don't like it.

612
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go screw yourself.

613
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:48,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're probably going to end up saying.

614
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:56,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous to even try to take these machines out because of a few images that flash in the background that you don't even notice anyways.

615
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm sure they'd be like, oh, it's subliminal then.

616
00:47:58,754 --> 00:47:59,494
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't notice it.

617
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets in their subconscious and they'll become murderers and rapists.

618
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one thing, though.

619
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it may be a sad thing, I should say.

620
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But, unfortunately, greed ruins over morality in a lot of cases.

621
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are you going to throw away an income of well into the thousands because it offends somebody?

622
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:25,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, true, there's some offensive material that I think should be removed on occasion.

623
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:32,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But on top of that, though, this is an instance where this small group is not really going to be able to make much of a difference.

624
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:33,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, true, right?

625
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

626
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:39,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, also, let's just, you know, say for instance that they do get away with it.

627
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Solo 2000 gone.

628
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, would you miss it?

629
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't miss it.

630
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was just, I don't miss the game.

631
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even care if they get rid of it.

632
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:51,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.

633
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a better game.

634
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a Max 2 machine.

635
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I mean... Well, okay, but, okay, say you go and upgrade the Solo 2000 to a fourth mix.

636
00:48:59,439 --> 00:48:59,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

637
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the background of Kick the Can.

638
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:02,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bunch of flying heroin needles.

639
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:04,623
[SPEAKER_04]: You've still got the same thing going on.

640
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:08,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think Secret Rendezvous has the best video.

641
00:49:09,007 --> 00:49:09,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

642
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:17,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they'll just want a Max 2 machine removed because there's lesbians all over the Secret Rendezvous video and it's a secret message that everybody should become a lesbian.

643
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:17,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesbians.

644
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:18,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

645
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Solo 2000 is a good machine.

646
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,680
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

647
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It attracts crowds.

648
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:28,521
[SPEAKER_06]: People actually go look for them.

649
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:30,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new face to the show.

650
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Glenn would like to contribute an opinion.

651
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:34,343
[SPEAKER_04]: An appearance and an opinion.

652
00:49:34,383 --> 00:49:39,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's the thing about the whole... Because basically what it is, it's censorship.

653
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:41,245
[SPEAKER_19]: And censorship never stops.

654
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:43,525
[SPEAKER_19]: It just keeps going further and further and further.

655
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,866
[SPEAKER_19]: And nobody's going to be happy until there's nothing left.

656
00:49:45,946 --> 00:49:47,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Because somebody will be offended by something.

657
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Either it's degradation of women...

658
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:58,928
[SPEAKER_19]: by the songs or images or whether it's subliminal messages that they think they hear or drug use or anything.

659
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:00,089
[SPEAKER_19]: It will never end.

660
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:07,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they keep... If it's a trend and they keep caving into these people, then DDR will be gone.

661
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:10,712
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there'll be something next after that.

662
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:13,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So a message to all you arcade owners out there.

663
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:14,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow some balls!

664
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:15,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Only in America.

665
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:16,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Wash your pussy!

666
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: and a message out there also as well to the coalition there that's taking out all the machines out there.

667
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,412
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we would love to hear your opinion.

668
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:35,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So please contact this station and we'll give you a fair interview and some equal time and let you present your side of the story because we're curious what your motivations are and maybe you can talk us out of playing DDR.

669
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

670
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:45,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Second off to the coalition, there's a place called Laser Force in Sacramento.

671
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:46,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Go take their machine.

672
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need a place to properly deposit this machine, I live at... Alright, anyway.

673
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:58,049
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about Laser Force and other evil Bomani things when we come back.

674
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:01,171
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to play something from Drum Mania.

675
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play something from... Well, it's actually Guitar Freaks also.

676
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:08,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play our namesake here, the lovely Orange Lounge.

677
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:10,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And their little medley from the new guitar.

678
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very good.

679
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

680
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,262
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back in about five minutes.

681
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:27,834
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

682
00:52:49,841 --> 00:52:52,163
A-flat, I believe, a little sharp.

683
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:52,783
Get this thing off.

684
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,644
Get this thing off.

685
00:52:53,664 --> 00:52:54,324
Get this thing off.

686
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Kale kale kuta kuta kuta ee oh ee oh

687
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:24,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Cargale, cuta, cuta, cuta, eh oh, eh oh

688
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:26,745
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

689
00:58:27,145 --> 00:58:37,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I would like to present to you the comic stylings of Irene, future comedian extraordinaire.

690
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:38,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep clapping.

691
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:47,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So these two muffins were baking in the oven, and the first one says to the other one,

692
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:49,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's getting pretty hot in here.

693
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:53,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second one's like, holy shit, a talking muffin!

694
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:26,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Monty Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

695
01:02:27,384 --> 01:02:37,411
[SPEAKER_18]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

696
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:41,815
[SPEAKER_18]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

697
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:45,237
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

698
01:02:45,297 --> 01:02:47,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We're live for our very first show.

699
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 8 o'clock.

700
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,240
[SPEAKER_04]: We're halfway through it.

701
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,740
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know?

702
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it this far, so let's see if we can get to the other end.

703
01:02:54,182 --> 01:03:00,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I think now would be a good time in the show for Jamie to be given space to do her little rant.

704
01:03:00,566 --> 01:03:01,426
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that sound, Jamie?

705
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:03,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds delightful, Ron.

706
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:04,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's hear it.

707
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear your little rant of the week.

708
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:09,050
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Jamie's big fuck you of the week.

709
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That goes to...

710
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to say parents at Roseville Golf Land.

711
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:16,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Who agrees with me here?

712
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:29,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially one delightful lady who I saw putting her three-year-old child on the keyboard mania machine to change a diaper.

713
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:32,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew a lot of people called that a shitty game, but...

714
01:03:35,623 --> 01:03:49,881
[SPEAKER_06]: She was checking his diaper, but she put the child on the keyboard, and I couldn't help myself but go up there and go, Excuse me, ma'am, and mentally I was going, and I used the term loosely, would you mind moving your child off of this machine?

715
01:03:50,141 --> 01:03:53,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I could go get management and make them, you know, have you pay for it.

716
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,153
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

717
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:24,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Walk off while their three-year-old, not three-year-old, more like a five-year-old was holding one of those big guitar controllers, which I have issues holding.

718
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:25,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Mommy, it hurts.

719
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:27,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like burning.

720
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:31,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, and I actually, I was playing drumming at the time.

721
01:04:31,811 --> 01:04:37,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I called the parent back and said, you need to get your, you know, you need to help your child because if they drop this on their foot, they will likely break their toes.

722
01:04:37,893 --> 01:04:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Attention to parents at Golfland.

723
01:04:40,155 --> 01:04:42,177
[SPEAKER_04]: This goes for not just Roseville Golf Club, but any golf club.

724
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:42,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Any arcade.

725
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie circulates a lot.

726
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,781
[SPEAKER_04]: She gets around, Jamie.

727
01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:46,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

728
01:04:46,402 --> 01:04:47,603
[SPEAKER_04]: At many different arcades.

729
01:04:47,623 --> 01:04:48,404
[SPEAKER_13]: She gets around.

730
01:04:48,424 --> 01:04:49,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I am such an arcade whore.

731
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:52,268
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.

732
01:04:52,928 --> 01:04:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will spank your child.

733
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,532
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

734
01:04:57,412 --> 01:04:59,273
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

735
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:29,592
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like that prime example of the people we got kicked out of Golfland the other night.

736
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

737
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they were getting up, bumming around the machine.

738
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:35,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We had management kick them out.

739
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:38,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, well, we actually got a restraining order that night.

740
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a Golfland restraining order the other night.

741
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

742
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:47,319
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy was hopping up on the Parapara machine while I was playing, and I nearly whacked him in the face one.

743
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he was making this act out of himself.

744
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he almost get hit with your ass, Deluxe?

745
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:52,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

746
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:55,083
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was when I stuck my fist out to do the side.

747
01:05:55,743 --> 01:06:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know how you have to stick your hand out to do... Well, I don't know how many power lists we have listening, but you stick out your hand side to side to do Deluxe, and I nearly palmed the guy in the face.

748
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, he deserved it because he was a moron.

749
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:11,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, you know, I can't go around hitting every stupid people I see or else my hand would fall off.

750
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:15,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but anyway, that's the rant, you know.

751
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:19,800
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have any parents who are listening to the show where I seriously doubt it,

752
01:06:20,558 --> 01:06:27,264
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, if you have younger siblings, you know, make sure that someone's got an eye on them, you know.

753
01:06:27,324 --> 01:06:29,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Look out for the little ones because we sure as hell aren't.

754
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,027
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not our job.

755
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:31,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the parents' job.

756
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:32,969
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll step on your children.

757
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to step on them and then they'll learn.

758
01:06:37,168 --> 01:06:43,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I would not consciously step on a little child if I couldn't help it.

759
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's my rant.

760
01:06:45,450 --> 01:07:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to comment on Jamie's Fuck You of the Week, or you'd like to comment on anything else we talked about the past hour of the show, I encourage you to join our chat room, which is located on server irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net and it's just channel...

761
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:26,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge, all one word so we look forward to seeing you in there and we'll take your comments and maybe talk about some of them on the show in future weeks on the Orange Lounge we are looking into getting the phone system here so we can take phone calls on the air but we're kind of doing some test runs to see what kind of reception the show gets because that's going to be a large investment to get the phones here so it might be a little while before we get those but we'd like to start taking phone calls, that would be cool

762
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:29,868
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

763
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can initiate a national boycott at Laser Force.

764
01:07:54,088 --> 01:07:54,768
[SPEAKER_04]: International.

765
01:07:55,068 --> 01:07:59,670
[SPEAKER_06]: The one issue with that is that I don't want them to go targeting every place that has a Solo.

766
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Walmart and Lodi.

767
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the Walmart and Lodi rules.

768
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:04,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it does.

769
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:09,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Any place you can buy Pringles and then go straight to play DDR just rules.

770
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I win so many toys out of the crane machines there, it's not even funny.

771
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:18,863
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's hear why Laser Force sucks.

772
01:08:19,324 --> 01:08:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell your Laser Force story.

773
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:37,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this has to do with the day that Iguana Girl and I and a certain unnamed, well, cockspanker, cockspanker for bucks, who is no longer worthy of a name.

774
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:45,322
[SPEAKER_06]: We all went to Laser Force to check out the new solo machine right around the corner from my house.

775
01:08:46,963 --> 01:08:55,608
[SPEAKER_06]: and people, please don't come to my house anyway we go in and we're all playing nobody's getting up and doing anything

776
01:08:56,574 --> 01:09:05,422
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, this woman's asking questions, you know, we're answering, she's got her kids there and then this group of little girls gets up by the machine and we've all been taking our turns and using a coin line.

777
01:09:05,482 --> 01:09:07,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone with common sense can see what a coin line is.

778
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:17,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually the mother got up and was complaining that, oh, you know, my kid wanted to get up here and, you know, we explained the coin line and we're like, okay, well, you know, we're going to go ahead and let your kid go.

779
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:22,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go ahead and, you know, trade this turn, just give us some tokens because we'd already had tokens in the machine.

780
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, no, I gotta go, and they left.

781
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:27,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And then management came up and just, like, tried to ream us.

782
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We were being, they were being very... Oh my goodness!

783
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:33,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it!

784
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:34,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's ruined!

785
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: As many times as I can fit it in.

786
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:46,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we had issues with them.

787
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:52,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, we just said we weren't going to come back, and I made sure to let everybody I knew.

788
01:09:52,524 --> 01:09:57,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, I think we've had a fairly successful boycott, haven't we?

789
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand that their business isn't doing very well.

790
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:07,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it's just, though, nobody really plays the solo there anyway, so they should just give me the machine.

791
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:10,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we wouldn't have to boycott them anymore.

792
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:13,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That is crime logic.

793
01:10:13,129 --> 01:10:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then that woman's gonna have to come to your house and remove the machine because she finds it offensive.

794
01:10:19,278 --> 01:10:20,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's my house.

795
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but the more furniture.

796
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:23,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's offended.

797
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jamie has a guard cat.

798
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:27,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Shermie would kill her.

799
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:30,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Shermie would roll around on the floor and out-cute her.

800
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:39,538
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, if somebody came to my house saying, you can't play this in your own home, that'd be the point.

801
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:42,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd break out the katana and decapitate somebody, okay?

802
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:42,822
Whoa!

803
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:45,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's evil, Jamie, ladies and gentlemen.

804
01:10:45,564 --> 01:10:46,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in my house.

805
01:10:46,925 --> 01:10:47,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It's self-defense.

806
01:10:48,006 --> 01:10:48,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's on.

807
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:49,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's on.

808
01:10:49,147 --> 01:10:49,367
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

809
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:52,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, all those steroids.

810
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Making me feel badly.

811
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:55,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

812
01:10:55,913 --> 01:10:56,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

813
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Laser Force sucks.

814
01:10:58,615 --> 01:11:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

815
01:11:00,116 --> 01:11:06,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The only official laser tag game that I can, you know, put my name behind is QZAR.

816
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:06,642
[SPEAKER_02]: QZAR.

817
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Played it for four years.

818
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:08,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Spent...

819
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good, 15 grand there.

820
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We should say that Loki was a Cusar nerd long before he was a DDR nerd.

821
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:15,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to hear it for Team Sack.

822
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:19,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Cusar, it was my first love.

823
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Once Cusar left last year around May, I was very sad, still sad to this day.

824
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, DDR became my new addiction, so...

825
01:11:32,142 --> 01:11:45,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to say, QZR rules, Laser Force sucks ass, and they were almost out of business just when QZR went and left, and then they came back just like a festering sore, so they can die.

826
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does smell like pee in there.

827
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And they smell like pee.

828
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:53,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I'm not the only person that noticed how bad it stinks in there.

829
01:11:55,443 --> 01:12:02,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, though, we've also got LaserX at Country Club Lanes, and we still have whatever thing is at Golfland.

830
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you're talking about LaserX?

831
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:12,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are local alternatives to LaserForce if you have to shoot the infrared beam at somebody.

832
01:12:13,655 --> 01:12:19,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, unfortunately, I do not have dramatic music to play when people are crying over their losses, but I do have Cam Laughter.

833
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:28,230
[SPEAKER_06]: We can play Flowers for Albion.

834
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I could load that one.

835
01:12:31,072 --> 01:12:31,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

836
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: House is so crazy right now.

837
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:42,001
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people in here playing... I banned... Didn't I ban that song from being played in the house?

838
01:12:42,995 --> 01:13:08,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid Crack Baby Oh my god, it's the evil Crack Baby I know, let's I see sitting in the corner over there, my roommates over there in the corner crying Let's bring them over here, I want to ask Brian a few questions Come here, come here Let Brian have the microphone here You gotta hold the mic far away from you because it's very sensitive It's like a penis, it's very sensitive Okay Don't get too close to the head or you're gonna get shot Anyway

839
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:14,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to hear about you and Glenn at night.

840
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:17,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, if you ever played, if you ever played DDR.

841
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:19,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have, Ron.

842
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:19,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you think?

843
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,860
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a penis envy contest at best.

844
01:13:26,422 --> 01:13:28,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie doesn't have a penis, last time I checked.

845
01:13:28,524 --> 01:13:29,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can make one.

846
01:13:29,345 --> 01:13:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make one.

847
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:40,247
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of this whole thing, this show, this house that you co-reside in being transformed?

848
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:46,032
[SPEAKER_20]: My house has a complete disaster area right now being overran by a bunch of geeks.

849
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:49,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, wait a minute, that's me.

850
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:51,437
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm stuck in the middle of it.

851
01:13:52,858 --> 01:13:54,079
[SPEAKER_06]: You're now an honorary geek.

852
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:55,540
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the meat in the geek sandwich.

853
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that was just a bad image.

854
01:13:59,442 --> 01:14:05,868
[SPEAKER_20]: That was just not somewhere I wanted to be.

855
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian and Meat at the same time, quotes Irene.

856
01:14:10,031 --> 01:14:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And followed by a... Very descriptive.

857
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:16,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments you want to add out there to the Bomani people listening?

858
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have quite a few people listening right now.

859
01:14:18,879 --> 01:14:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you want to say to the addicts out there at Bomani?

860
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:30,989
[SPEAKER_20]: and besides the fact that they turn my house completely upside down when you throw these types of things and that I'm going, I have no house and no life right now.

861
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, there's a pool.

862
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:33,110
[SPEAKER_20]: You could go swim.

863
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,450
[SPEAKER_20]: That's quite all right.

864
01:14:35,511 --> 01:14:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a ball, Brian.

865
01:14:36,411 --> 01:14:37,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you go bounce it?

866
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:38,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Rob.

867
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:41,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually want to thank you very much for the use of the... Well, thank you.

868
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:42,873
[SPEAKER_06]: At least someone.

869
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:43,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, Brian.

870
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:47,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make an edit in your honor.

871
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:49,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Aww.

872
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:50,544
[SPEAKER_06]: To Pink Dinosaur.

873
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:55,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

874
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being on the show, Brian.

875
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:57,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

876
01:14:57,572 --> 01:14:58,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo, Brian!

877
01:14:59,034 --> 01:14:59,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

878
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:00,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the only one happy.

879
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you don't have a microphone.

880
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:03,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

881
01:15:06,063 --> 01:15:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: What now?

882
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:09,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get away from Bomani.

883
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,466
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, we can't fill two hours with Bomani.

884
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:10,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can.

885
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what do you want to talk about then?

886
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:13,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomani.

887
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:14,889
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is Bomani?

888
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:15,610
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to talk about?

889
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:16,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

890
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Our personal cross-dresser is not here tonight.

891
01:15:19,838 --> 01:15:21,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ryan was supposed to be here tonight.

892
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Where'd he go?

893
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:24,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, our cross-dressing fellow admin is not here tonight.

894
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:25,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is he at?

895
01:15:26,748 --> 01:15:27,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew he had to work today.

896
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:29,451
[SPEAKER_04]: He's out cross-dressing playing Para somewhere.

897
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:34,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew he had to work today, so maybe he didn't show up because of that.

898
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:35,039
[SPEAKER_04]: He's out working.

899
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,561
[SPEAKER_04]: What corner is he working today?

900
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: That would probably be one of the corners of the power machine.

901
01:15:42,691 --> 01:15:47,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But if my ototo-chan is listening tonight, dude, get here.

902
01:15:48,832 --> 01:15:52,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's fill it with witty banter.

903
01:15:53,073 --> 01:15:53,353
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

904
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:54,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

905
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you come on.

906
01:15:56,434 --> 01:15:57,134
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want to talk about?

907
01:15:57,514 --> 01:15:59,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there anything about Monty really you want to talk about?

908
01:16:00,454 --> 01:16:01,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.

909
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:03,755
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Matt say something?

910
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:24,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to announce, for all those people that do play The Sims out there, for DWI, actually, Bimani Ruler, you might know him from DDR Mania X, he's having a blitz for the next two weeks, he's going to be releasing a new file every day, and if anyone hasn't played his stuff, do play it, it's awesome.

911
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:29,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, in fact, his release was the Classic Party Triathlon, which I have to say was...

912
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

913
01:16:31,866 --> 01:16:34,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And so go try that, and that's it.

914
01:16:36,954 --> 01:16:40,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone watch the webcam, because every once in a while something crazy is going to pop up.

915
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Something out of control.

916
01:16:43,257 --> 01:16:45,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Something you didn't expect, something crazy and wild.

917
01:17:14,565 --> 01:17:18,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And Brad comes back from the webcam room with this weird grin on his face.

918
01:17:19,489 --> 01:17:20,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we fear?

919
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we be scared?

920
01:17:22,631 --> 01:17:24,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should look at the, uh, cam.

921
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it got caught.

922
01:17:27,695 --> 01:17:29,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like somebody's parrying the deluxe.

923
01:17:29,676 --> 01:17:36,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, um, that's Brian playing DDR after he just... Brian's playing DDR after he was just in here slamming the rest of us.

924
01:17:36,361 --> 01:17:40,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, now he's going, see, it's more truth that Vamani just owns everybody.

925
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:40,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

926
01:17:40,725 --> 01:17:40,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think not.

927
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Paul goes to play DDR now.

928
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:45,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my picture?

929
01:17:45,515 --> 01:17:45,816
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

930
01:17:46,317 --> 01:17:48,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so were we going to...

931
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:50,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

932
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:51,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Irene has an idea.

933
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:53,982
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to... Okay, go ahead.

934
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,003
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say?

935
01:17:55,043 --> 01:17:59,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, we could talk about Max 2, because that's what everybody talks about these days.

936
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:00,186
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Burning Heat now.

937
01:18:00,206 --> 01:18:03,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We just unlocked Burning Heat yesterday, which is kind of a big deal.

938
01:18:03,648 --> 01:18:06,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really the only song anybody seems to care about in Max 2, is Burning Heat.

939
01:18:07,211 --> 01:18:15,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kakumei, but Kakumei kind of... It was the big deal in the beginning, but then as people started unlocking Burning Heat, it was just like, Oh my god, Burning Heat!

940
01:18:15,376 --> 01:18:16,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Burning Heat makes me cum.

941
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:22,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you guys think about Max 2?

942
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:25,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Max 2 was the first new DDR that I had a reason to get excited over.

943
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:29,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Max 2 is everything that Max should have been.

944
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of been the opinion across the board.

945
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's got way more songs than Fifth Mix had.

946
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:35,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm sorry.

947
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:37,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got about the same amount of songs as Fifth Mix had.

948
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: But Max had like 40 songs.

949
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:39,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It had nothing.

950
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:41,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Max had way more.

951
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice.

952
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:47,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's missing from Max 2 that you'd like to see in our next installment of DDR?

953
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:49,468
[SPEAKER_04]: In Max 3, if they should actually take it that far?

954
01:18:49,488 --> 01:18:51,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the ability to have flat dark mode.

955
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:53,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Flat dark mode.

956
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:56,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Because dark and flat run on the same modifier, so you can't use them both.

957
01:18:57,043 --> 01:19:09,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, we should be able to have more songs and less, maybe not less Oni modes, but make Oni modes, make more Oni modes accessible at first and not unlocking a lot of Oni modes.

958
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:14,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I noticed we unlocked a lot of Oni modes and hardly any of them were songs.

959
01:19:14,614 --> 01:19:17,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're even between Oni and extra.

960
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:18,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

961
01:19:18,297 --> 01:19:18,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Or close.

962
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:22,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think people want more songs to play because Oni mode is,

963
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:28,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, in my opinion, a little bit harder for people because it's a perfect attack thing, you know, or a great attack.

964
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:30,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's really hard.

965
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:39,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, remember in 4th Mix how they had the, you could come home and make your own non-stops on the home version of 3rd Mix and save it to the card and then take it to the arcade and play your own non-stop?

966
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:41,270
[SPEAKER_04]: They should do something like that for Oni.

967
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:47,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why they hesitate doing it because then everybody would just make a 10 song non-stop of a bunch of basics and they'd be able to stay on the machine all day.

968
01:19:47,674 --> 01:19:52,897
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe limit the homemade non-stops to as many songs as you would have on the normal game.

969
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:57,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or maybe a certain amount of sets you have to have in a song or something like that.

970
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:02,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think that it might work better to do something very similar to how 2DX has it.

971
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:04,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, have an expert course.

972
01:20:05,445 --> 01:20:05,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah!

973
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:07,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what Oni is, in a way.

974
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good idea.

975
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:25,572
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's people out there that maybe want to play Oni that can't play Maniacs.

976
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:27,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that they maybe should have had an easy Oni course?

977
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:29,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, exactly.

978
01:20:29,714 --> 01:20:30,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Just plain devil's advocate.

979
01:20:31,595 --> 01:20:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'd like to see would be to have actually more unlockable stuff.

980
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:37,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily more songs.

981
01:20:37,357 --> 01:20:39,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, more songs would obviously be great.

982
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:44,620
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say, for instance, we could have different sets for a song being added in or something like that.

983
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe even...

984
01:20:46,877 --> 01:20:58,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, just have like sort of a challenge mode where you play and you get more points, you know, to go towards, you know, unlocking songs, but have it be like a certain really hard, strange thing that you haven't seen before.

985
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:03,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even, you know, bringing back solo via megamixes where you have three songs.

986
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:05,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Megamixes are pretty cool.

987
01:21:05,254 --> 01:21:06,375
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I'd like to see come back.

988
01:21:07,732 --> 01:21:17,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember how in Solo 2000, which is getting way too much talk time on the show tonight, you have the, like, one chorus had Afronova, Dropout, and I think Wild Rush.

989
01:21:18,056 --> 01:21:21,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cool thing about it is it wasn't just a non-stop, the songs actually mixed together.

990
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty neat.

991
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:23,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

992
01:21:24,098 --> 01:21:26,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, well, go ahead, finish your talk, because I'm going to change the subject a little.

993
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

994
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was just about the different steps, like Matt was saying.

995
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:35,562
[SPEAKER_03]: What I kind of missed was, it was kind of cool, I think it was on one of the versions of Third Mix, there was alternate steps for some of the songs.

996
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:38,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like, down, down, you know.

997
01:21:39,206 --> 01:21:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the club append steps, actually.

998
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it for like, Brilliant to You, Keep On Moving.

999
01:21:44,473 --> 01:21:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see some of that come back.

1000
01:21:46,676 --> 01:21:48,118
[SPEAKER_04]: What about new stuff?

1001
01:21:48,138 --> 01:21:51,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about a lot of old stuff we'd like to see make a return.

1002
01:21:51,502 --> 01:21:53,405
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think Konami can keep...

1003
01:21:54,306 --> 01:21:55,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1004
01:22:10,932 --> 01:22:12,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Prevent themselves from releasing a DDR final.

1005
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,595
[SPEAKER_04]: What can they do to keep... They can put a foot pedal.

1006
01:22:16,456 --> 01:22:17,236
[SPEAKER_04]: On DDR?

1007
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:21,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I've often thought that they need to do partner solo.

1008
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, have the six panel solo set up, but with two players.

1009
01:22:26,702 --> 01:22:29,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, instead of having the linked machines like they work now.

1010
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:32,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Not if you put enough space in between the machine.

1011
01:22:33,346 --> 01:22:36,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Or set it up like the three player Parapara.

1012
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:41,370
[SPEAKER_06]: where you have three panels with the large monitor in the front.

1013
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:45,812
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR could be made to accommodate that and have it with Solo.

1014
01:22:46,472 --> 01:22:52,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see DDR on a humongous screen like, I say pump it up, is on a huge screen.

1015
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:55,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like, though, how... Go to Fry.

1016
01:22:55,915 --> 01:22:59,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like... Oh, I don't like the setup.

1017
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:02,937
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that's worth talking about here if we want to change the subject a little bit.

1018
01:23:02,957 --> 01:23:04,077
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that when we come back from break.

1019
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:05,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's save that for later.

1020
01:23:05,078 --> 01:23:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep talking about mechs.

1021
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Max is maximum.

1022
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:17,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing I don't like about Pump is it's got a huge screen, but then it's got this humongous box that just kind of sits out there, and the screen goes back.

1023
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:19,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like looking at the end of a tunnel to see what you're looking at.

1024
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:20,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of odd.

1025
01:23:20,464 --> 01:23:25,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd like it to look more like 2DX, which is a giant freaking huge... I think you're too tall for Pump It Up.

1026
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:26,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too tall.

1027
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you can add to it would be more modifiers to, like, say, for instance, stuff you can do with the arrows.

1028
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, have them all mixed up.

1029
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:35,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Have, um...

1030
01:23:35,871 --> 01:23:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things I thought, even for doing some of my edits and stuff, maybe even have it where, like, stuff in the background kind of helps you, you know, not to be able to see the arrows just right.

1031
01:23:44,678 --> 01:23:47,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, have a bunch of arrows all of a sudden appear in the background.

1032
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Just crazy shit like that.

1033
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's kind of, a lot of people say Flash in the Night was like that on Macs, because when it would go Flash, the screen would do this seizure thing, like, amazing seizure robots, Flash!

1034
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:05,395
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it was kind of hard to see your arrows, so... They also need to put in, like, super random mode, like they have in 7ix Guitar Freaks.

1035
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:33,179
[SPEAKER_14]: where like in normal shuffle mode like all the up arrows become something like left down or right but you can have them so all the arrows are completely random so they'd still appear in the same place but they'd all be completely random and not appear in any order and figure out some way to shuffle double steps because I'm just sick of being able to only play it on regular or play it on mirror and really that's just the same yeah yes

1036
01:24:35,106 --> 01:24:52,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a dumb idea once, because I'm terrible at freestyling, so I always thought it would be so cool if they put a screen on the back of DDR so that you could turn around and not fuck up.

1037
01:24:53,305 --> 01:25:21,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember when I first played Only You You're right, that is dumb Yeah, and I'm going to kick you Like, I turned around, and I tried to turn around again And I totally messed up because, you know, I don't know how to freestyle Well, that's part of freestyling, is learning how to turn around Now, I know you have issues with Mirror, but I fucking hate Mirror Mirror is the devil Okay, what I meant was, like, you know, just If you want to turn around and start doing steps or some shit like that, you know, like

1038
01:25:22,548 --> 01:25:29,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I don't know, I can't look at a step chart and know what I'm doing because I am a complete retard.

1039
01:25:29,974 --> 01:25:32,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saying that they should make a freestyle for dummies machine?

1040
01:25:33,017 --> 01:25:34,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, exactly, yeah.

1041
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:35,599
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR autistic mix.

1042
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's freestyle DDR or some shit like that.

1043
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's a possibility.

1044
01:25:39,742 --> 01:25:40,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be expensive.

1045
01:25:40,983 --> 01:25:44,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the thing is, I don't know how they would be able to pull that off.

1046
01:25:44,766 --> 01:25:49,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it would block the view of people who'd want to watch anyway, so that'd be kind of pointless.

1047
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1048
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:55,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And the bars would obviously pose a problem because some people need bars.

1049
01:25:55,661 --> 01:26:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in the back of the room is yelling and you can't hear it over the microphone and suggesting that they just take the bars off the next DDR Mix.

1050
01:26:02,145 --> 01:26:04,266
[SPEAKER_04]: There is going to be a tournament coming up in August.

1051
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:09,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I happen to know there's going to be a tournament in Concord at Mountain Mike's that they are taking the bar off the machine for freestyle.

1052
01:26:10,009 --> 01:26:11,150
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be pretty cool.

1053
01:26:12,131 --> 01:26:14,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have more details on that as they're announced.

1054
01:26:14,292 --> 01:26:15,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the chat room here.

1055
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:19,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Joe Mama suggesting that they have each arrow go at a different speed.

1056
01:26:19,995 --> 01:26:35,359
[SPEAKER_04]: For like a modifier you can set each arrow to go at a random speed That would be crazy, I don't know, that's almost a little too weird Do you think there's any, besides adding new panels, adding new screens, bigger screens Is there anything Konami could do to the game itself to make it more interesting?

1057
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:38,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they pretty much just have to trash the whole damn thing and start over?

1058
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I got another idea, kind of similar with ParaPara where you have set routines to do

1059
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:47,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe set something up like have a freestyle mode or something where they actually have a set routine for a song.

1060
01:26:47,773 --> 01:26:48,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Freestyle for dummies.

1061
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:52,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, you know, kind of get ideas or something.

1062
01:26:53,299 --> 01:26:54,380
[SPEAKER_04]: White people dancing mode.

1063
01:26:54,841 --> 01:26:55,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1064
01:26:55,321 --> 01:26:57,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Teaching you how to do country line dancing.

1065
01:26:58,024 --> 01:27:22,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't imagine this would actually be a new DDR but, you know, they've got Parapara, they have DDR they should do something that combines the both together where you have like maybe a sensitive panel beneath you plus the sensors above so it's not just where you wave your hands or where you're stepping but you are doing everything and you memorize their dances or you just have to be in the right place at the right time.

1066
01:27:23,165 --> 01:27:25,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was thinking this might sound kind of

1067
01:27:26,317 --> 01:27:29,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I had explained it right, but I was thinking maybe they'd add like mini panels.

1068
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:33,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe where you could do like little hand plants and stuff, you know.

1069
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could have like the floor, little moles would come up out of the floor and you could step on them with your feet.

1070
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe my dead spider stomp.

1071
01:27:40,242 --> 01:27:41,922
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know, maybe that should be it.

1072
01:27:41,962 --> 01:27:44,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they should just make the whole thing like a... You know what?

1073
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:48,144
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with DDR, we want spider stomp 2DX.

1074
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:48,884
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

1075
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:50,764
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1076
01:27:50,824 --> 01:27:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: How about they just get rid of actual panels and they just make the whole pad pressure sensitive?

1077
01:27:58,410 --> 01:27:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So, pressure sensitive?

1078
01:27:59,531 --> 01:28:00,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.

1079
01:28:00,092 --> 01:28:04,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then, like, the whole thing would be just one huge panel, and then, yeah.

1080
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:04,735
[SPEAKER_04]: One huge panel.

1081
01:28:04,755 --> 01:28:05,375
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.

1082
01:28:05,415 --> 01:28:08,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you could kind of freestyle that way, and they can put arrows wherever they want.

1083
01:28:08,898 --> 01:28:11,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like Saturday Night Fever, where you got the light-up dance floor.

1084
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be cool?

1085
01:28:14,202 --> 01:28:15,723
[SPEAKER_06]: You can suggest, like, John Travolta.

1086
01:28:15,903 --> 01:28:16,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be somewhere else.

1087
01:28:18,725 --> 01:28:19,285
[SPEAKER_03]: More thoughts.

1088
01:28:19,305 --> 01:28:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my two cents.

1089
01:28:21,251 --> 01:28:24,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking maybe Konami should just give us all free machines.

1090
01:28:25,115 --> 01:28:26,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd like that.

1091
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:27,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

1092
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:27,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you hear us, Konami?

1093
01:28:27,897 --> 01:28:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Hook us up.

1094
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Konami, if you're here listening, which I doubt you are.

1095
01:28:30,499 --> 01:28:30,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami, I love you.

1096
01:28:30,979 --> 01:28:31,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a machine.

1097
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,582
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, I think it's time to go into another break here.

1098
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go listen to a request right now.

1099
01:28:38,526 --> 01:28:42,069
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to listen to some Jerry Hallowell with It's Rainin' Men.

1100
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:44,411
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a request, by the way, from the chat room.

1101
01:28:44,491 --> 01:28:45,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge.

1102
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:59,791
[SPEAKER_04]: which you can visit us on irc.eggheads.org and visit our website as well as http://orangelounge.sky.cx In the meantime, this is for Dark Tetsuya in the chat room.

1103
01:28:59,992 --> 01:29:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Jerry Halliwell from Max 2.

1104
01:29:01,414 --> 01:29:01,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1105
01:30:18,368 --> 01:30:23,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Waymen, Waymen, Waymen It's time to scream it!

1106
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:24,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to scream it!

1107
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:54,003
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1108
01:31:06,302 --> 01:31:07,023
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

1109
01:32:23,349 --> 01:32:24,406
Thank you for watching!

1110
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:20,438
But I guess that's the way to let you know I'm here

1111
01:33:57,093 --> 01:33:58,095
Thank you for watching!

1112
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:12,705
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe

1113
01:35:37,053 --> 01:35:40,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye, baby balloon.

1114
01:35:40,856 --> 01:35:44,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye, baby balloon.

1115
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitch, get a new song.

1116
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:51,363
[SPEAKER_17]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1117
01:35:51,403 --> 01:35:53,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, get a new damn song, lady.

1118
01:35:54,025 --> 01:35:57,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the very first show.

1119
01:35:57,707 --> 01:35:58,828
[SPEAKER_04]: About 8.36.

1120
01:35:58,908 --> 01:36:00,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking this show two hours, by the way.

1121
01:36:00,749 --> 01:36:01,890
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to 9 o'clock with this.

1122
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We think if the show is successful in the future, we'll try three hours, but...

1123
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:14,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is kind of an interesting situation because my co-host Jamie, the lovely Jamie Summers, is going to be gone for the next two shows.

1124
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:27,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm going to be in San Diego next weekend and then I'm going to Anime Expo where I have enlisted aid to do interviews with several of the people there in cosplays and general views and crap.

1125
01:36:27,731 --> 01:36:30,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one thing we're going to bring you on future episodes of Orange Lounge.

1126
01:36:30,732 --> 01:36:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to do interviews.

1127
01:36:32,672 --> 01:36:41,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we were going to be taking a trip yesterday over to Sunnyvale because we knew a lot of people were going to be convening there and we wanted to get some interviews with your favorite Bay Area personalities.

1128
01:36:41,574 --> 01:36:46,015
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, we weren't able to get out there because I had a job to do.

1129
01:36:46,035 --> 01:36:48,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I got work, so we couldn't make it out there.

1130
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,356
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to try in future weeks to get out there.

1131
01:36:50,376 --> 01:36:52,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have any event in NorCal that you'd like us to come cover...

1132
01:36:53,937 --> 01:36:58,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop us an email, orangeloungeradio, that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll try and make it.

1133
01:37:00,039 --> 01:37:06,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Even SoCal events we'll consider, but pretty much anything further away than that, we don't really have a travel budget to accommodate yet.

1134
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:09,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to give us money, we'll definitely think about it.

1135
01:37:09,782 --> 01:37:10,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Money is good.

1136
01:37:10,902 --> 01:37:12,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Money is always wonderful.

1137
01:37:12,102 --> 01:37:14,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Money facilitates going places and doing things.

1138
01:37:17,308 --> 01:37:17,689
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1139
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:19,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have some new subject matter.

1140
01:37:19,831 --> 01:37:20,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1141
01:37:21,073 --> 01:37:33,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The last song we played just before coming out of that break was LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix with Overblast, which is something brand new in the new USA DDR Max that's going to be released.

1142
01:37:34,389 --> 01:37:36,051
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the release date on that, Jamie?

1143
01:37:36,071 --> 01:37:36,291
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1144
01:37:37,245 --> 01:37:42,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they said they were going to do it in October.

1145
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: November.

1146
01:37:44,252 --> 01:37:57,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys, I kind of had a hunch that this is what was going to happen at E3, is that they were kind of keeping it a secret that there was going to be a new DDR release in the USA, and it turned out to be that they are going to release Max in the USA, except it's not just the same song list.

1147
01:37:58,306 --> 01:38:06,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be some old songs, like Brilliant to You, Orchestral Groove is in it, and AM3P I believe is returning as well.

1148
01:38:06,355 --> 01:38:13,262
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends who is not into Beimani, he was kind enough to videotape some of the game for me while he was at E3.

1149
01:38:14,864 --> 01:38:18,488
[SPEAKER_06]: The songs that I saw being played, I remember definitely that one of them was Insertion.

1150
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:22,409
[SPEAKER_06]: He said that it looked very clean.

1151
01:38:22,469 --> 01:38:23,850
[SPEAKER_06]: He was very impressed with it.

1152
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:26,611
[SPEAKER_06]: He got to hear a little bit of some talk about it.

1153
01:38:26,631 --> 01:38:33,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the tape it sounded like everybody's favorite Konami rep, Jason Enos, in the background giving some information.

1154
01:38:33,433 --> 01:38:40,835
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can find the tape, I'll definitely make sure that I have the segment encoded so that everybody can see it or try to do something like that for everyone.

1155
01:38:40,855 --> 01:38:42,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's something we can put up on our website.

1156
01:38:42,296 --> 01:38:42,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty cool.

1157
01:38:43,676 --> 01:38:46,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of old stuff and there's going to be new stuff.

1158
01:38:47,139 --> 01:38:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that is going to be new is 20 new tracks to the USA.

1159
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:53,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that has not been on any Japanese release.

1160
01:38:54,264 --> 01:38:58,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of those songs right there we just played for you, Overblast, from Beatmania 5th Mix.

1161
01:38:58,647 --> 01:39:01,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a song in DDR Max with steps and all that fun stuff.

1162
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:07,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been promised that we're going to have some licensed songs in the new DDR.

1163
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:09,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hope so.

1164
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:14,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hopefully no more crappy remixes of AM3P.

1165
01:39:14,726 --> 01:39:16,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I like the remix of AM3P.

1166
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You do?

1167
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:20,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the one in Max 2 is okay, but... I like all of the remixes of AM3P.

1168
01:39:20,432 --> 01:39:21,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the Canomics one.

1169
01:39:21,694 --> 01:39:23,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the remix of Superstar, but that's me.

1170
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, Overblast.

1171
01:39:29,983 --> 01:39:33,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That song, eh, I could think that you picked a better one.

1172
01:39:33,604 --> 01:39:35,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's entitled to an opinion.

1173
01:39:35,424 --> 01:39:40,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my opinion on this is that that song sucks ass, and I wish that they had picked a better song.

1174
01:39:40,986 --> 01:39:44,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, out of all the beat mania songs in the world, why the hell do you pick that song?

1175
01:39:45,107 --> 01:39:46,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, that song sucks ass.

1176
01:39:47,327 --> 01:39:52,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick, like, The Fall, I mean, pick, uh, Nopia, I mean, there's a bunch of songs.

1177
01:39:52,889 --> 01:39:55,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell, why not 321 Stars or something like that?

1178
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:56,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

1179
01:39:57,663 --> 01:39:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that song.

1180
01:39:59,084 --> 01:40:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, there's still 19 other songs that can be on there.

1181
01:40:02,487 --> 01:40:04,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have my hopes up for this.

1182
01:40:05,269 --> 01:40:06,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you'll be pleased.

1183
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:08,932
[SPEAKER_04]: They say there's licensed songs that are going to be in it.

1184
01:40:09,132 --> 01:40:16,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be pretty cool if they went back and took some old school 80s songs or old 90s songs or even some current stuff and made it popular.

1185
01:40:16,358 --> 01:40:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as long as it's not Britney Spears or some of that new top 40 crap.

1186
01:40:18,699 --> 01:40:21,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be glad that Britney Spears is working with Metro and not Konami.

1187
01:40:22,202 --> 01:40:22,542
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1188
01:40:22,562 --> 01:40:25,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So no Britney Spears is likely in the new Max USA, which is nice.

1189
01:40:25,824 --> 01:40:30,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means no Jive Record artists will be on Max USA, which pretty much eliminates all the top 40.

1190
01:40:30,267 --> 01:40:31,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was much rejoicing.

1191
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:32,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1192
01:40:32,588 --> 01:40:35,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And no remixes of Let Them Move.

1193
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:36,650
[SPEAKER_04]: God, no.

1194
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:40,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has been promised on one of those message boards.

1195
01:40:41,193 --> 01:40:45,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It was promised that there's no Let Them Move in any way, shape, or form.

1196
01:40:46,736 --> 01:41:12,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, Konami comes to a good decision, hooray for them So we'll keep bringing you news on Max USA as we hear it Because it's going to be a big freaking deal At least for us Because they all say that DDR is dying in Japan I don't know if there's any truth to that We're not in Japan, so we don't really know if it's dying or not But that's what people are saying So we'll see Maybe it's dying there, but it's going to be big here So maybe they'll start focusing their efforts on what's starting to become a fad here

1197
01:41:13,335 --> 01:41:28,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually like, you know, in the whole respect that we're getting this Max USA, I would like to actually, I'm probably not listening, but I would still like to give a big kudos to Jason Enos of Konami of America for all of the hard work that's been put into us getting these games.

1198
01:41:29,298 --> 01:41:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: and anybody that happened to contribute.

1199
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I know he's kind of the contact person.

1200
01:41:33,862 --> 01:41:37,045
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one that lurks on all the DDR boards and stuff, letting us know what's going on.

1201
01:41:37,065 --> 01:41:40,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But anybody that happens to be involved with that whole process deserves some thank you.

1202
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:44,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever woke up over there and said, let's bring DDR to the U.S.

1203
01:41:44,652 --> 01:41:47,956
[SPEAKER_04]: and let's bring them something new, not just recycled crap that they've already imported.

1204
01:41:48,616 --> 01:41:51,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know Konami's got to know about all these import machines.

1205
01:41:51,058 --> 01:41:56,941
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing that's completely boggled me, is you've got all these Max 2 machines popping up everywhere.

1206
01:41:57,001 --> 01:42:02,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the new thing, which is great, because Max 2's the best mix they've done in a long, long time, I would say.

1207
01:42:02,364 --> 01:42:03,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people wouldn't argue with me there.

1208
01:42:04,886 --> 01:42:13,891
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yet Konami doesn't seem to be... They have that, you know, this message is illegal for use outside of Japan message that comes up on the screen, but yet they're not really doing anything about it.

1209
01:42:14,572 --> 01:42:16,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All these Max 2 machines are still sitting there, so...

1210
01:42:17,253 --> 01:42:25,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're not seeing a new release, at least that I've heard of, or that, you know, as far as an arcade release, I haven't seen any new releases come through.

1211
01:42:26,378 --> 01:42:43,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure exactly the reasoning behind that, but, you know, if they're not minding us getting those imports or they're not actively trying to stop it, let's not bring that up and not, you know... It's very interesting to see that we're actually getting a brand new, you know, actually it doesn't look like something recycled, as Rob was putting it,

1212
01:42:44,537 --> 01:42:46,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it's looking like they're putting time in it.

1213
01:42:46,378 --> 01:42:51,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, adding features like, you know, the .5 speed and other things like that, it looks pretty good.

1214
01:42:51,859 --> 01:42:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, .5's kind of a weak feature.

1215
01:42:53,959 --> 01:43:02,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really... How many people are going to... Outside of Max 300, which is, in my mind, it's kind of a crutch, if you're going to use .5 speed to beat Max 300.

1216
01:43:02,861 --> 01:43:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: What...

1217
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:08,323
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the use of 0.5?

1218
01:43:08,403 --> 01:43:08,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1219
01:43:08,984 --> 01:43:10,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just to make things challenging, you think?

1220
01:43:10,665 --> 01:43:12,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's to make things more challenging.

1221
01:43:12,426 --> 01:43:17,529
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other things I was looking at is hopefully this won't be as buggy as Chronomix was.

1222
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:29,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I have problems with the fact that you can't take the edits off there, put them on Japanese machines because, you know, they do have region coding inside the actual edits also, which kind of sucked ass.

1223
01:43:30,117 --> 01:43:31,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they'll fix that this time around.

1224
01:43:32,559 --> 01:43:33,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's very interesting that...

1225
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:40,004
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, they're getting Euromax, which is the brand new Euromix there, which is awesome.

1226
01:43:40,145 --> 01:43:42,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we could get some of their songs over here.

1227
01:43:42,346 --> 01:43:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish, yeah.

1228
01:43:43,727 --> 01:43:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be neat.

1229
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:49,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe this is Konami's little trick, is that they're going to actually take those songs they put in Euromix and give them to us.

1230
01:43:49,772 --> 01:43:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's interesting, though, is Euromax, they're also getting a machine for that.

1231
01:43:53,595 --> 01:43:58,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can be looking forward to DDR USA Max also.

1232
01:43:58,098 --> 01:43:58,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

1233
01:43:58,759 --> 01:43:59,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be very nice.

1234
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:07,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, something that's being suggested in the chat room, a use for .5, imagine my summer love maniac on .5 flat.

1235
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:10,010
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like fun.

1236
01:44:10,211 --> 01:44:17,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, stealth, that kind of eliminates, that eliminates, oh, okay, we'll stop.

1237
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:20,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's effectively stealth, what we're hearing from the back of the room.

1238
01:44:21,543 --> 01:44:22,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting suggestion there.

1239
01:44:24,148 --> 01:44:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know when we're going to hear more news on Max USA, but we'll give that to you as soon as we hear any more information on that.

1240
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we have been hearing little bits and pieces about, it's kind of a surprise to most people, was DDR PC.

1241
01:44:37,491 --> 01:44:40,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not talking about the politically correct version of DDR with the heroin needles removed.

1242
01:44:40,632 --> 01:44:43,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about DDR for the personal computer on IBM.

1243
01:44:43,632 --> 01:44:44,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard about this at all?

1244
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:45,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have.

1245
01:44:45,593 --> 01:44:48,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually exclusive to friesandoutposts.com.

1246
01:44:48,313 --> 01:44:49,073
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go buy it there.

1247
01:44:49,093 --> 01:44:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like Forth Mix on a PC.

1248
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:54,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got 40 characters you can choose from.

1249
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:58,374
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have more that you can actually download off their website at some point or another.

1250
01:44:59,034 --> 01:45:00,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's been kind of iffy.

1251
01:45:00,536 --> 01:45:04,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been having it available, then coming soon, available, coming soon.

1252
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:07,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're having a little bit of trouble getting the actual product out there.

1253
01:45:07,323 --> 01:45:08,484
[SPEAKER_02]: They're falling short on that.

1254
01:45:08,985 --> 01:45:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the song list goes, you only have a few more that actually aren't available in any of the U.S.

1255
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:14,451
[SPEAKER_02]: versions.

1256
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:17,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But pretty much it's just a rehash of 4th Mix all over again.

1257
01:45:17,896 --> 01:45:25,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I was promised to be able to try this out pretty soon, so I'll be able to maybe give a review on that.

1258
01:45:25,459 --> 01:45:26,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be nice, next week maybe.

1259
01:45:26,759 --> 01:45:34,982
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the features that was pretty interesting with this one was the fact that they're adding internet ranking, just like 4th Mix and all the other Japanese releases had.

1260
01:45:35,482 --> 01:45:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is pretty good.

1261
01:45:36,742 --> 01:45:41,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how well it's working out, though, because you have people playing on keyboards and you have people playing on pads.

1262
01:45:42,304 --> 01:45:43,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of...

1263
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:48,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, inflating of people's actual ability on there.

1264
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks pretty good if you haven't had any home versions.

1265
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if there's some kind of switch that would be able to show, hey, this person played on the pad or this person played on the keyboard.

1266
01:45:57,884 --> 01:46:01,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But even then, any hacker could probably wire a switch that would look like a pad.

1267
01:46:02,045 --> 01:46:06,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, no, they do have such a thing in Dance with Intensity.

1268
01:46:06,046 --> 01:46:10,288
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it where it actually detects whether it's keyboard or playing with controller.

1269
01:46:10,368 --> 01:46:11,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, still...

1270
01:46:13,309 --> 01:46:13,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1271
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:18,674
[SPEAKER_04]: If they just did a port of the PlayStation version, they probably didn't bother to go that far with it.

1272
01:46:19,295 --> 01:46:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing, I remember before the break, Dave was out here talking about Fry's.

1273
01:46:23,899 --> 01:46:30,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of people on the West Coast probably haven't seen this because they don't have Fry's Electronics outside of California too much.

1274
01:46:31,866 --> 01:46:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got this really interesting setup for DDR.

1275
01:46:33,707 --> 01:46:35,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Have any of you guys been over to Fry's and seen their DDR setup?

1276
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the two BADs on the ground, and Fry's is on a concrete floor, at least the one we go to here in Sacramento has a concrete floor on it, so it makes it pretty good to dance on.

1277
01:46:44,636 --> 01:46:45,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of feels like the arcade BAD.

1278
01:46:46,577 --> 01:46:49,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they've got like a big screen TV with DDR economics going on it.

1279
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I've gone into Fry's, I don't play DDR at Fry's.

1280
01:46:53,543 --> 01:46:54,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of weird.

1281
01:46:54,563 --> 01:46:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be stared at by all those weird people.

1282
01:46:56,705 --> 01:46:57,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one doing that.

1283
01:46:58,226 --> 01:47:04,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I constantly see little kids in there playing on the thing, and those things, the pads and games sell.

1284
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:10,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like I always seem to look over, and there's one set of parents, at least one set of parents looking at the games, thinking about buying them.

1285
01:47:10,816 --> 01:47:12,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fry's has kind of been pushing it.

1286
01:47:12,477 --> 01:47:15,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But people really, really, really want to go to GameStop.

1287
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, and I'd like to respond to Joe Mama in the chatroom about editing images and posting them.

1288
01:47:21,615 --> 01:47:31,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they have passwords, and basically it's just a long string of letters and numbers that they give you when you, you know, finish your songs to post up for the internet rankings.

1289
01:47:31,763 --> 01:47:37,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have anything to do with screen captures or anything like that, so there's really no way to cheat as far as photoshopping goes.

1290
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:43,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm sure there's ways you could probably find to, you know, crack the passwords and all that kind of thing.

1291
01:47:43,314 --> 01:47:48,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, it sounds like it was going to be just like the ranking for 4th Mix and 5th Mix and Max 2.

1292
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything had on it where you had the long passwords.

1293
01:47:51,261 --> 01:47:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty much a lifted system from that.

1294
01:47:53,663 --> 01:47:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it matches any other game, though.

1295
01:47:56,145 --> 01:48:01,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you were to play a song on another mix, it gives you the same code that... You know, that does remind me...

1296
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone, I believe, we should make it a part to actually post somewhere the actual, there is internet ranking in Max, too.

1297
01:48:09,414 --> 01:48:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know about it.

1298
01:48:11,035 --> 01:48:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play three songs, certain songs in a row, you'll actually get a password and stuff that you can post on the internet ranking site.

1299
01:48:17,498 --> 01:48:19,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many people know that that's actually out there.

1300
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:20,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, interesting.

1301
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps we might need to make this a future contest or something, you know?

1302
01:48:27,608 --> 01:48:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

1303
01:48:28,449 --> 01:48:38,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Japanese and people from the barrier are probably dominating that internet ranking list there, but we could give it a try.

1304
01:48:38,598 --> 01:48:39,839
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also the Oni ranking.

1305
01:48:39,879 --> 01:48:45,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there is, somewhere on Team Guilo's page, there has been a page for the Oni ranking.

1306
01:48:46,325 --> 01:48:54,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they went to the effort to translate the internet ranking page into English, so a big shout out to them for doing that, because that's a good favor to the whole community there.

1307
01:48:55,322 --> 01:49:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the community, we'd like to make a mention that if ever, you know, whenever we're not hosting our show live, you can also check out a lot of the community action for the Sac Baymani forums located at www.sacbaymani.com.

1308
01:49:10,455 --> 01:49:13,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I.com.

1309
01:49:14,198 --> 01:49:14,498
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1310
01:49:35,831 --> 01:49:38,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a really quick break here and then we're going to come back and wrap things up.

1311
01:49:38,756 --> 01:49:41,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do a set of a couple 2DX songs and then we'll come right back.

1312
01:49:41,982 --> 01:49:44,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with Rizlam here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1313
01:50:01,753 --> 01:50:02,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1314
01:50:32,943 --> 01:50:33,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1315
01:53:19,713 --> 01:53:21,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my fan when I need it?

1316
01:53:21,434 --> 01:53:22,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to do the Tran Dance.

1317
01:53:23,275 --> 01:53:23,995
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tran Dance.

1318
01:53:24,516 --> 01:53:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: The Starmine Tran Dance.

1319
01:53:26,197 --> 01:53:29,238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually the way I freestyle in 2DX.

1320
01:53:29,638 --> 01:53:32,520
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little break in Starmine and I'll do a little spinny arm thing.

1321
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that was Ryu with Starmine.

1322
01:53:35,562 --> 01:53:37,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, Rick with Rizlam.

1323
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: from 2DX.

1324
01:53:39,704 --> 01:53:43,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, they've been playing 2DX all night here in the broadcast room.

1325
01:53:43,365 --> 01:53:44,826
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing, what is this, Love Will?

1326
01:53:45,306 --> 01:53:46,247
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great 2DX song.

1327
01:53:46,267 --> 01:53:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll play that next week.

1328
01:53:47,247 --> 01:53:48,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That's old school 2DX.

1329
01:53:48,307 --> 01:53:49,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Old school 2DX.

1330
01:53:50,168 --> 01:53:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting ready to wrap up the show here, our first show.

1331
01:53:52,109 --> 01:53:54,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to thank everybody here for listening tonight.

1332
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for listening to our first show.

1333
01:53:55,931 --> 01:53:58,532
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to a little piece of Bomani history, I'd like to thank.

1334
01:53:58,932 --> 01:54:00,394
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1335
01:54:19,031 --> 01:54:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Right before, right when we came back from the last segment.

1336
01:54:21,373 --> 01:54:23,475
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie, you're going to be gone for a couple weeks now.

1337
01:54:23,535 --> 01:54:26,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the co-host of the show, yet you're already abandoning us, but with good reason.

1338
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:37,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to AX every year, and I'm actually heading down a week early to go to San Diego to see some friends and to hunt down our little Youth Coalition friend with a chainsaw.

1339
01:54:37,566 --> 01:54:43,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, with a recorder so I can maybe get an interview if the door's not slammed in my face.

1340
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:43,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1341
01:54:44,591 --> 01:54:47,453
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, I'm going to be at Anime Expo.

1342
01:54:47,473 --> 01:54:48,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have recorders with me.

1343
01:54:49,314 --> 01:54:53,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of you people who are going to be there, watch out for the girl with the wings.

1344
01:54:54,457 --> 01:54:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I will be in costume.

1345
01:54:55,497 --> 01:54:55,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen cosplay.

1346
01:54:55,937 --> 01:54:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1347
01:54:57,118 --> 01:54:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's cosplay costume is something else for this.

1348
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:06,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be either in costume as Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary or Baiken from Guilty Gear X or Leona from King of Fighters.

1349
01:55:06,918 --> 01:55:12,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So watch out for the short girl in the costume with the big black wings and the face paint.

1350
01:55:12,865 --> 01:55:16,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Our website was finished today and your picture's on it so they can find it there.

1351
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:17,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1352
01:55:18,031 --> 01:55:18,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1353
01:55:19,292 --> 01:55:20,013
[SPEAKER_04]: But the issue is...

1354
01:55:21,048 --> 01:55:24,390
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still doing the show every week, so we're going to have an open seat.

1355
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:27,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what do you think I should do about this predicament we're in?

1356
01:55:27,492 --> 01:55:28,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I have them all fight over it?

1357
01:55:29,033 --> 01:55:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I make them all play 2DX to see who wins?

1358
01:55:31,694 --> 01:55:34,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do like the clown car thing and pile them all in.

1359
01:55:34,416 --> 01:55:34,656
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1360
01:55:34,956 --> 01:55:36,657
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do the clown car thing and pile them all in.

1361
01:55:36,858 --> 01:55:38,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I could make them all sit in the big chair.

1362
01:55:38,138 --> 01:55:44,082
[SPEAKER_06]: The seat is really cushy, and I think that we should just put caution tape around it, and people have to caution drop to get in.

1363
01:55:44,702 --> 01:55:45,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1364
01:55:45,403 --> 01:55:47,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Do Trippie L.

1365
01:55:48,755 --> 01:55:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, there we go.

1366
01:55:49,455 --> 01:55:50,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do elimination.

1367
01:55:51,476 --> 01:55:52,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We could trivia battle.

1368
01:55:52,616 --> 01:55:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do Bomani Survivor.

1369
01:55:56,637 --> 01:55:59,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But the seat will be filled by a random individual.

1370
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:04,760
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will be temporarily filled because I don't let up my spot easily.

1371
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do Bomani Pop Idol.

1372
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,561
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

1373
01:56:09,321 --> 01:56:09,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awful.

1374
01:56:10,061 --> 01:56:10,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

1375
01:56:11,082 --> 01:56:12,302
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what you're talking about.

1376
01:56:13,462 --> 01:56:14,423
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?

1377
01:56:14,463 --> 01:56:16,584
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not coming to Hollywood, you little bitch.

1378
01:56:16,744 --> 01:56:17,964
[SPEAKER_04]: You are the weakest link?

1379
01:56:18,845 --> 01:56:19,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck off.

1380
01:56:19,085 --> 01:56:19,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

1381
01:56:19,645 --> 01:56:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much a cross between the weakest link and Star Search.

1382
01:56:21,966 --> 01:56:24,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why I don't watch TV anymore.

1383
01:56:24,808 --> 01:56:28,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we should do karaoke to see who stays on.

1384
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:34,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe what we'll do is we'll just come back next week and we'll kind of surprise everybody with who we're going to have.

1385
01:56:34,513 --> 01:56:36,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll talk about it during the week.

1386
01:56:37,105 --> 01:56:41,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, unless you have any... We will have a lovely surprise waiting for the crowd next week.

1387
01:56:42,608 --> 01:56:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

1388
01:56:44,249 --> 01:56:45,130
[SPEAKER_05]: No karaoke?

1389
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:47,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And no karaoke?

1390
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:48,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do karaoke.

1391
01:56:49,372 --> 01:56:52,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you.

1392
01:56:53,494 --> 01:56:54,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Irene Moss, anyway.

1393
01:56:55,435 --> 01:56:56,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no I didn't.

1394
01:56:57,176 --> 01:57:00,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we could just settle this the good old D&D way, where's my dice?

1395
01:57:01,205 --> 01:57:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1396
01:57:01,985 --> 01:57:03,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody chatbot!

1397
01:57:03,426 --> 01:57:05,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I know all of you know what D&D means, too.

1398
01:57:06,487 --> 01:57:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're all a bunch of dorks.

1399
01:57:08,628 --> 01:57:10,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You sacrifice chickens by the week.

1400
01:57:11,148 --> 01:57:11,689
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this?

1401
01:57:11,909 --> 01:57:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: How about we pick a number between 1 and 6.

1402
01:57:13,629 --> 01:57:15,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, everyone picks a number.

1403
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say it on the air.

1404
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:20,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have someone that's in our chatroom type a random number between 1 and 6.

1405
01:57:21,832 --> 01:57:23,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be who hosts, since we all have a dice.

1406
01:57:26,519 --> 01:57:27,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I got an 18 strength.

1407
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:28,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to own you all.

1408
01:57:29,521 --> 01:57:30,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Six different numbers.

1409
01:57:37,286 --> 01:57:53,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we have a moment of silence to decide, since the microphone can't pick up the people in the background, I think that we will have a random guest next week, and we will surprise our beautiful, lovely listeners, who we all love very much and are trying not to bore to death.

1410
01:57:53,297 --> 01:57:55,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And if worse comes to worse, we'll just pass the headset around.

1411
01:57:55,859 --> 01:57:57,501
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let everybody sit in the chair for a segment.

1412
01:57:57,521 --> 01:57:58,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound like a fair option?

1413
01:57:58,642 --> 01:58:00,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so now you're pimping out my chair.

1414
01:58:00,644 --> 01:58:01,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll pimp out the chair.

1415
01:58:02,105 --> 01:58:05,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new co-host for next week will be the Bomani pimp.

1416
01:58:05,228 --> 01:58:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

1417
01:58:05,748 --> 01:58:06,469
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be the whore.

1418
01:58:06,829 --> 01:58:08,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to be the pimp to pimp out the chair.

1419
01:58:08,871 --> 01:58:09,511
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be our whore.

1420
01:58:09,571 --> 01:58:11,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so they'll be the Bomani whores.

1421
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:12,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1422
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:14,521
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get ejected out of the chair.

1423
01:58:14,581 --> 01:58:15,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Say something stupid.

1424
01:58:15,482 --> 01:58:15,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Bail!

1425
01:58:15,982 --> 01:58:16,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're out of the chair.

1426
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:21,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a button with a spring, and if you piss me off... It'd be like Russian Roulette.

1427
01:58:21,425 --> 01:58:22,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll fall through the floor.

1428
01:58:26,508 --> 01:58:27,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Russian Roulette.

1429
01:58:27,089 --> 01:58:29,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like that MTV show, Remote Control.

1430
01:58:31,251 --> 01:58:32,372
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be like Remote Control.

1431
01:58:32,652 --> 01:58:37,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, see, there is a sign of being old when you remember when Remote Control was new.

1432
01:58:38,504 --> 01:58:40,225
[SPEAKER_06]: That mitten and you're old, if you remember.

1433
01:58:40,245 --> 01:58:45,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the song they all sang when the person went through the wall?

1434
01:58:52,309 --> 01:58:53,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

1435
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:53,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Party!

1436
01:58:56,432 --> 01:58:59,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I think we're going to bring this show to a close now.

1437
01:58:59,754 --> 01:59:01,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody for listening.

1438
01:59:01,055 --> 01:59:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Please join us next week again at 7 o'clock.

1439
01:59:03,657 --> 01:59:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to rebroadcast this show sometime through the week.

1440
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:10,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't figured out a good time yet, so if there's a part you missed, you can hear it later.

1441
01:59:10,922 --> 01:59:16,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But do send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, all one word.

1442
01:59:16,986 --> 01:59:20,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And let us know what songs you want to hear through the week.

1443
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:25,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all your suggestions and stuff.

1444
01:59:25,373 --> 01:59:26,795
[SPEAKER_06]: All your suggestions are belong to us.

1445
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:27,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1446
01:59:27,375 --> 01:59:28,196
[SPEAKER_06]: For great justice.

1447
01:59:28,757 --> 01:59:30,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're going to end the show now.

1448
01:59:30,058 --> 01:59:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to everybody for listening and we will see you next week on the Orange Lounge.

1449
01:59:35,445 --> 01:59:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts, Jamie?

1450
01:59:39,009 --> 01:59:40,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Be excellent to each other.

1451
01:59:40,611 --> 01:59:41,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Party on, dude!
