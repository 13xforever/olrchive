6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You bitch!

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now let me check the disco.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You one, two, fuck you!

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You have no morals.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun in the scorching case of her face.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hidey ho.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Me too!

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Fucker yet?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm working on it.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Loser.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lame!

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On the side of my face.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breathing.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Grassless.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Heaving grass.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Heaving.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
records.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000

With me, as always, is a lovely co-host who has 12 lovely vanilla cans, might I add.

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's Dark Sakura, aka Jamie Summers.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whoo! I have a bill of coke. It's crack.

We've got a whole lot of people in the studio.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Say hello, studio!

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello!

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, there you go.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Any other first things you want to say, Jamie?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh, hi.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That works for me.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Alrighty then, we'll be right back where we'll be talking about the first show, and lots of other firsts, and whatever the hell else we feel like.

We'll be giving that out for the rest of the show, won't we, Jamie?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh yes, quite often.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Alrighty.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
For the very first great song, I'm going to play something for the Fantasia album.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is Vanessa Mae with Destiny.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And it's Vanessa Mae at Freaky Rocks, don't it, Jamie?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Vanessa Mae owns it.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright, here we go.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's my destiny.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey!

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey!

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey!

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey!

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:52,920
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you remember then? Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Is this burning, an eternal flame? I believe it's my duty, darling I want you when you see me, you belong to me Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?

59
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
And it's burning, an eternal flame

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Save a man, sunshine through the rain

61
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Life's so lame, and you can't even see

62
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I don't wanna lose this feeling

63
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Say my name

64
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Let me shine through the rain

65
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm on a flight

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
So long as it ain't somebody's name

67
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I don't know who to see or hate

68
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't you lie, just give me your hand

69
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Don't you see, just give my heart to me

70
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Do you know what to say, just give me your hand

71
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Am I only dreaming?

72
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Is this burning?

73
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
An eternal flame?

74
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Give me your hand

75
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Don't you see, just give my heart to me

76
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:09,460
Do you want to have a dream and an eternal Sche Friend?

77
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:18,580
Do you want to have a dream and an eternal Sche Friend?

78
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:28,580
And it turns out all right

79
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,580
No, no, nobody knows

80
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
No, nobody knows

81
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
No, nobody knows

82
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Can't take me

83
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,580
No, no, nobody knows

84
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,580
No, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, no, nobody does, can't take me

85
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Goodbye, baby balloon

86
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
Goodbye, bye, baby balloon

87
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
Bitch, get a new song!

88
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,580
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

89
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Here we are live on our very first broadcast

91
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
How's it feel, Jamie?

92
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:21,020
me? It feels like burning! My thoughts exactly. So, I guess we kind of have to explain a little

93
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,420
bit about the history of Orange Lounge Radio, and this is kind of an idea that Jamie and

94
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:33,380
I have had going on for a long, long time. Long, long, long time. Whose idea was it anyway?

95
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,100
It was Brad's idea. He just claimed it. It was all Brad's idea. It's your fault. So if

96
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,660
you want to blame somebody for this talk show, Trainwreck, just blame Brad. How's that sound?

97
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:54,660
I think the idea came to us, what, probably back in January? When was the first time you guessed it on the other show, Under Sedation Live, that we participated in?

98
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,660
That was in January or so, wasn't it? I know it was this year.

99
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I think it was probably back in January.

100
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,660
It was after I got my new computer, so that had to have been in January.

101
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,900
When Jamie was on the first Undersedation Live that she was on, which is another show

102
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,440
that I co-host, you can visit that website at http://undersedationlive.org, or it's actually

103
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,980
one of our friends on the Live 365 site, so if you go to Live 365 and take a look at our

104
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,220
fellow broadcasters, we have the Undersedation Live listed there, and that's the show that

105
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,180
I co-host on Saturday night.

106
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,180
And I also like to say, if Travis happens to be out there listening tonight, I really

107
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,580
appreciate all the help, and this drink's for you. There you go. That relates to last

108
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,380
night's show, don't worry about it.

109
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,940
So, probably back when Jamie hosted this show in January, we thought, you know, we oughta

110
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:55,540
do a Bamani talk thing for Bamani. Just not, you know, just, uh, Under Station Life kind

111
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,900
of was born of the Rocky Horror genre, because we always used to go to Rocky Horror every

112
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,760
Friday, Saturday night, whatever, and then this is kind of our new addiction as

113
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Bamani because we don't really have Rocky Horror in Sacramento anymore, so we

114
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,600
thought, hell, we'll do a show about Bamani. So, but The Understation Live kind of, it

115
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,240
took the Rocky thing, it kind of grew out of that, I don't know, it still kind of

116
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
relates to Rocky in a way, but it's kind of its own, its own child now, and we

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,240
thought we'd see what kind of bastard son we get out of this idea, the Bamani

118
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,280
show. Getting some kind of Siamese twin joined the head sort of mutant freak.

119
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
week. But hey, we're cool that way.

120
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
You're just evil, aren't you?

121
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Oh yes, I am pure evil.

122
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
And you know what, people like me that way so

123
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
they can shut up.

124
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
So we've got a lot of people here in the studio tonight

125
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
and we've got this interesting setup as we got

126
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
in the house. We've got two game rooms

127
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
going. We've got one in the back and if you look

128
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
at the webcam on our website,

129
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
http colon slash slash

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
orangelounge.sky.cx

131
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
You can see on the webcam there's

132
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
some people, I think they're playing Max in there right now

133
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't know. I think so. In the other room.

134
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,600
here we've got keys pounding which you can probably hear because we've got Brad in here

135
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,640
playing some 2DX. Yell something to the studio audio or the people out at home, Brad.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,280
LED on view. He said LED on view if you can hear that.

137
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Playing the theme of Dungeon J. He's playing the theme of Dungeon J over there.

138
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,280
He's playing the theme of Dungeon J. Thank you, Irene. Yes, he is playing the theme

139
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:28,920
of Dungeon J. Anyways, I thought we'd stay here since this is our first show. Let's talk

140
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,920
about DDR, the first experiences of DDR, 2DX, BeatMania, whatever it is, because that's

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,280
a long time ago for some of us, especially Jamie. Speaking of firsts, since it is the

142
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,080
first show, we are kind of expecting that there's going to be a lot of issues tonight,

143
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,480
so please bear with us throughout all the technical difficulties and everything else

144
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,160
going on. We have the communal microphone over here on the fireplace. We have the communal

145
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,280
microphone that everybody's going to have to talk into, which Irene has pretty much

146
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,620
parked herself near, so I think we'll know who we'll be hearing from most of the night

147
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,360
over there. First experience is with Bamani, because it's kind of something you see once,

148
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,040
you play it once, and then you're pretty much stuck with it for the rest of your life, especially

149
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,200
if you're listening to this program. If you've actually gone out of your way to tune into

150
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,160
a Bamani-focused radio program, you're obviously a very ill person who's come down with a Bamani

151
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
flu.

152
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:37,380
come to my threats no no no they're not dorks are you so Jamie what was your

153
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,860
very first the money experience was the first time yeah I know you out of

154
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,160
probably most people here I'm not sure cuz we haven't really compared everybody's

155
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,100
notes yet now most people here you were probably the very first person to play

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,900
DDR and all that to go way back in time let's go to 1999 around of February or

157
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,940
march at first heard of the media

158
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,220
and thought though that was kind of dorky

159
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,980
and i actually had beat me in ninety eight on my computer so that was my

160
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,300
ever first meeting in they have

161
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,540
how many of us started with bm ninety-eight region and

162
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,760
that'd be me and brad anyway

163
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,780
uh... i went to an expo i had heard of the institution said that it looks

164
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,740
stupid

165
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,340
i'm gonna play best to move

166
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,540
so i was in the best to move to turn it in a x nineteen ninety nine

167
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,780
spent like an hour owning everybody before i got a faulty controller

168
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,640
and uh... so whenever it was a key to see because i heard

169
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,700
uh... shake your booty playing

170
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,960
and it was your second mix

171
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,020
so that was my first tdr i didn't actually really play it and then

172
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,460
i hit uh...

173
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,760
makes two thousand

174
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,220
and i saw the first one on playstation and got hooked and i borrowed my

175
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,300
friend's game

176
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,120
couldn't pass butterfly

177
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,380
I was asleep one night, woke up the next morning, and just, like, passed a butterfly at random.

178
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,980
So I didn't see my first DDR machine until AX2000. It was the third mix. It was two dollars

179
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,840
a game, and, well, I dished out two dollars a game, slept in the room, and there went

180
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
my addiction.

181
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,240
And I started off with the Dreamcast, and nobody can say anything. Sega owns.

182
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Not anymore.

183
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Don't bite me.

184
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Hey, CIG is making games for the game crew.

185
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,240
third-party stuff is is looking pretty good so I got to give them some credit

186
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,240
give them lots of credit and actually DDR Club on the Dreamcast is much better

187
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,680
than the PlayStation version because they had to they had to split the

188
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,920
PlayStation version into two two CDs and that kind of sucks but on Dreamcast it's

189
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,280
all in one nice shiny little package my first DDR experience was I and funny

190
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,400
enough you know this this show that this is kind of spun off of is a Rocky Horror

191
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,800
theme show I actually first discovered DDR at a Rocky Horror convention and

192
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
and this was, hell, I don't even know, I think it was 2000.

193
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm getting so old. I think in October of 2000,

194
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,560
we were at a convention in Las Vegas

195
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,800
at the Hard Rock Hotel, and they were showing the movie Friday

196
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,040
and Saturday night, but we decided, you know what, once a week's enough, so we're

197
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
not going to go Friday night.

198
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,280
We're just going to go out to the arcade and we're just going to play games, because that's what we want to do.

199
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,360
And there was one of those big dancing machines with the flashing seizure lights,

200
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
and we all wanted to play it. That was your first night too, wasn't it?

201
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,040
I mean, anything else you wish to add about...

202
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,060
About DDR? Do we play our first game together?

203
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,480
No, I think

204
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,960
it was just me by myself first, because you guys were pussies. Okay, I don't remember.

205
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,200
And you're like, we're white, we can't play this, let the Asian do it first, and then we'll look cool, you know,

206
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,180
after. No, I'm kidding. I don't know.

207
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah, we were at Circus Circus, and what was it, a 1.5?

208
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,000
I was the old U.S.A. machine.

209
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,140
I distinctly remember the song Butterfly.

210
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Shut up!

211
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Shut up!

212
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Everybody played it!

213
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,580
I remember it was the spinning discs that you can choose from instead of the song list.

214
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,820
Yeah, I remember that much.

215
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,140
And we fucking sucked.

216
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
We were terrible.

217
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
We were like...

218
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
I remember passing.

219
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
We passed the first song.

220
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Didn't I pass Boom Boom Dollar the first time?

221
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,340
Yeah, you passed the second song and I was like sleeping by then because I failed like

222
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,300
the first three steps.

223
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,480
i would like to take this moment to give Irene an inside joke

224
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,820
and then the maid

225
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,780
that's the best joke ever

226
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,540
shush Brad

227
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:28,100
oh my god this show is going to suck

228
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,280
so after that we came back home to Sacramento, land of nothingness

229
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,100
and

230
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,740
we thought that was pretty much it, that was the only time we were going to play DDR and then we found that

231
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,620
Roseville Golf Land

232
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,100
ended up getting

233
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,320
its own d r machines sometime and i think

234
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,540
what december of two thousand every covered it being this is a really

235
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,660
u s a mix

236
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,100
and everything toward the end of the summer

237
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,780
because

238
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,480
i've been playing at country club lanes

239
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,160
the evil place

240
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,000
and then

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,040
i heard haters u s a machine over at risk of off and went over there and

242
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,860
that's a lot of people

243
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,840
uh... danielle first into her and that brad

244
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,600
and then i did

245
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,660
a bunch of people at milpitas golf land

246
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,280
first-rate ship to find our part with the sacrament strolls yes the sacrament

247
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,720
stills we

248
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,420
we we need a sexy badly bleeding

249
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,720
and we don't die if you're not okay

250
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,020
anyone else in the room care share their first the money story has really

251
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,560
desperate for material right now

252
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,180
because they're going to have this we're never going to fill a two-hour show

253
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,180
We have to prove them wrong, even if we have to bullshit for just two hours.

254
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Uh-oh, he's got the microphone. Everybody run.

255
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Loki, a.k.a. Matt, would like to share a story.

256
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Let's see, my first experience with Bimani.

257
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:55,180
I'd have to say it started back, I believe it was the year 2000, with Phantomacon.

258
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,180
I saw someone playing a five-key beat me in a second mix.

259
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,180
And, actually, it was really cool.

260
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,180
What song that hooked me was the theme for Metal Gear Solid.

261
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:14,180
And from there I went and bought everything for Beatmania, played it a couple times, and put it away.

262
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:23,180
And then next year comes around 2001, and I saw them playing DDR 4th Mix, which was really awesome.

263
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
That game I really got into.

264
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,180
And so I actually got a chance to play it the first time in Lake Tahoe, and I found out I had no rhythm whatsoever.

265
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,180
In fact, I sort of looked like Steve Martin in The Jerk.

266
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
I just had absolutely...

267
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Now that's an obscure reference no one's ever going to get, but that's okay.

268
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,180
It was just, like, horrible.

269
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
It was just very sad.

270
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,180
And unfortunately, I didn't get the clue and get off the machine after one game.

271
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,180
I stayed and played three games with absolutely no rhythm whatsoever.

272
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,180
So then, you know, flash forward back to about a year ago,

273
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,180
I come to find out after I moved from El Dorado Hills to Orangeville

274
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,540
ville that roseville's got you know fourth and a usa machine and i had during the time picked up

275
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,620
also my own home version of fourth and third with two pads and i'd been practicing on pink dinosaur

276
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:22,620
and lucy nerita oh jesus oh yeah i remember those anyways so then i started playing at roseville

277
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,940
constantly i used to do nine hours a weekend and actually i think i still do about nine hours a

278
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
a week.

279
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,340
Excuse me to cut you off for a minute, Brad, Brad, Brad, yeah, that song is banned in this

280
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
house.

281
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,780
Do not play 250 BPM in this house.

282
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:45,540
Everybody in this house has nightmares about that freaking crack baby in the video.

283
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm sorry to cut you off, go ahead.

284
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh, that's alright.

285
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,140
So yeah, nine hours a week for, you know, a whole year so far.

286
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,580
Alright, woo, yeah, yeah, okay.

287
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Anybody else want to share their first story? Brad, I'd love to hear your story. Come on. Put the controller down. Come on.

288
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Oh! There's somebody. Who's going to walk through the door?

289
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,580
And the doorbell rings. More victims! Ha ha ha!

290
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,580
This is your life.

291
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,580
I know.

292
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Or this is our show.

293
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Anyway.

294
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Actually, before we go on to whoever our guest is, I actually would like to make a mention.

295
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Would you? Go for it.

296
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:33,580
This is just a general shout-out. This goes to DDR Freak Radio, all the other Bimani radio stations out there you guys own and keep doing it because we need to keep Bimani on the air and keep everything alive too.

297
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:42,580
I agree. We need to keep doing shit like Bimani X Radio, all those other radio stations out there. Who else is broadcasting? I know there's a user on DDR Freak who has their own station.

298
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,380
station. There's probably about 10 different stations. You put the money into live365.com,

299
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,180
you're going to get about 10 different stations that come up. And there's commotion going

300
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,820
on at the door there. Hey, Paul's here. What's up, Paul? We're going to give a shout-out

301
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,980
to all those other Bahmani stations out there, because especially, if you might have heard

302
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:05,680
this past week, I believe it was Thursday, the new royalty rates for internet radio came

303
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,280
down. And we're going to have to pay seven cents for every song heard by a thousand listeners.

304
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Now, granted, this station will never, ever, ever have a thousand listeners.

305
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
We hope.

306
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
We just hope.

307
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
And if it does, we have ways to control that.

308
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
That still sucks.

309
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I mean, that's way too much.

310
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I mean, what does the RIA think?

311
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,280
We're going to start charging people for when, like, I have a party and there's a DJ here playing music

312
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
and I have a hundred people at the party, are they going to come bang down my door and steal my wallet

313
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
because I'm playing music for my friends at a party?

314
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Well, isn't it retroactive too?

315
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
We're just promoting albums here.

316
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,600
I'm sure Konami, since pretty much this whole thing is just, you know, sucking Konami's

317
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
cock here, because they're the ones that do all of Bomani games and everything.

318
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Did you say cock?

319
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes, I did say cock.

320
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,080
By the way, if you didn't hear the disclaimer at the beginning of the show, it is an adult

321
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
program.

322
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,440
This whole Bomani thing, I'm sure, since we're pretty much whoring out Bomani, they really

323
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
don't give a crap what we're doing, so they probably wouldn't come after us, but still,

324
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,000
for everybody else out there, for all the other shows out there, this is a really, like,

325
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,820
stupid thing that they're trying to do, it's just trying to charge us for every little

326
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,720
thing we do

327
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,640
we're not going to take it

328
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,100
there's two roots to that one of them is greed

329
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,340
number two

330
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,600
it's called

331
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,340
having something crawl up your ass and die

332
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,340
exactly that happened to me tuesday don't even care about people

333
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,580
maybe anal greed

334
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,540
that doesn't sound right

335
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,820
like anal spider

336
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,460
I like anal spider. But anal spider is cool because they do beat Nani as Seth.

337
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,700
That was my anal spider noise.

338
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,140
Let's do that again.

339
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,260
Wow. That's not quite what I remember from the song.

340
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,460
Was it Macho Gang?

341
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,500
You kind of have to get on that face of the...

342
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,540
A petty just stuck to me. Isn't that crazy?

343
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,820
You're going to have to get on that face of...

344
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
As Rob goes off on another tangent.

345
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
No, it's the dying giraffe sound from the South Park movie.

346
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Hey, what do you mean, boy?

347
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
Hey, Paul's here. Paul, say hi.

348
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Paul, say hi.

349
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,820
Hi, everybody.

350
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
Give Paul the microphone, because we're talking about...

351
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Let the adults have the show.

352
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Don't make out with the microphone.

353
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,820
In other words, don't perform sexual acts on the microphone.

354
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Since this is the first show of Orange Lounge,

355
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
the Monty Talk show that no one says will work,

356
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,660
because there's no way to fill up two hours about talking about the money

357
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,660
believe me if we have gone how many months now of playing the money and

358
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,420
never shutting up about it like uh... afternoon i'm not going to say i don't

359
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,900
have a life outside of the money because

360
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,860
because i don't like to admit it

361
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,580
it's not everything but we can certainly develop two hours of the show

362
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,420
if we spent fifteen minutes on each game alone that was actually ours at two

363
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,420
two hours a week that we can fill. So we're talking about firsts. So we want to know everybody's

364
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,420
first experience with Imani and why they're so addicted.

365
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
So tell us how you lost your Imani virginity.

366
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,740
If it's the heroin needles that shoot out when you do a good job or what?

367
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,860
Paul, that was a question for you.

368
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,700
Yes, tell us about your first experience.

370
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,740
Um, well, I would just, you know, I started out with DDR and it just led on the other

371
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,940
things, you know? I didn't mean to. I thought I was just going to stick with DDR, but I

372
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm so sorry!

373
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,940
I don't know, I came around the corner and I saw Beatmania

374
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
I had to try and I couldn't stop

375
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
and just let on the other things guitar freaks

376
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Now I have no money

377
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
I don't know what I'm going to do

378
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
He has to steal the play

379
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Oh my goodness

380
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
I can't believe it

381
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Everything's ruined

382
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
Smartass

383
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
How many doses do you have?

384
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
You only have like

385
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Just enough to fill up the show

386
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Anyway.

387
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Give us more! When?

388
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
More what he sounds like.

389
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,940
I can fill up two hours with just sound effects. That's not a problem.

390
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Here's a little number I tossed off recently at the Caribbean.

391
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
I'm not singing with it this time.

392
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Doesn't it all be nice to have a penis?

393
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dog?

394
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,940
It's swell to have a city. It's divine to own a dick.

395
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,940
From the tiniest little tagger to the world's biggest prick.

396
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,940
So three chairs for your Willy or John Thomas.

397
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Hooray for your one-eyed child, the snake.

398
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,940
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy, or your cock.

399
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,940
You can wrap it up in ribbon, you can slip it in your sock.

400
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,940
But don't take it out in public, or they will stick you in the dock.

401
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,940
And you won't come back.

402
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Don't say I don't have enough sound effects to fill up a show,

403
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
or you're going to get subjected to crap like that for two hours.

404
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I guarantee it.

405
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,460
I know I got these on my very own. Hey, hey, hey, okay, big boy now

Don't stop, don't stop!

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Come on, come on!

To all you fellas, this is just a game

453
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,620

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,940
we think we figured it out

479
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,120
orange lounge Radio

480
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Ah, the lovely karaoke stylings of me there in that little, uh, ditty, uh, one-hit wonder.

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Oh, oh, oh, can I have your autograph?

Drop your moves.

487
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,120
I just showed him now he's not going to talk for the next half hour.

488
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Now we're really R-rated, you know, we've had nudity on for now.

489
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Not boobs.

490
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
That was, that was our little, our little hippie-

491
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I don't know if anyone picked that up.

492
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,940
little hippie-hoppy set there our fresh set our booty fresh set brought to you

493
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:31,500
by cracker starting off from 2dx and then two songs from ddr solo 2000 six

494
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,860
panel version of ddr dream a dream by captain jack the booty mix who that is

495
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:42,300

496
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,060
don't give a shit about solo 2000 anyway sucks anyway exactly ever since that

497
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,700
Infamous Tournament, that's kind of become the catchphrase. How did that happen anyway?

498
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,380
You probably know more about the story behind Solo Sucks Anyway than I do. Because I'm sure

499
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,100
a lot of people would like to know why, whenever they talk about Solo, somebody always jumps

500
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,620
into the thread and goes, Solo sucks anyway! I think it resulted from a failed routine.

501
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,660
I don't know the entire story. That's kind of what I heard too, is that somebody had

502
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,100
failed a routine, and this is an arcade infinity tournament, and unfortunately I don't know

503
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,900
the name of whoever failed it, so I can't... I did, but I couldn't remember it off the

504
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,400
Right.

505
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,200
So they failed their song, and they were just like,

506
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,780
because they were giving away a solo machine at this tournament.

507
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,280
Yes.

508
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
And they were just like, eh, solo sucks anyway.

509
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,080
I didn't want it.

510
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,780
Anyway, so that's what this game is about.

511
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,120
But DDR Solo, in the news around the community this week,

512
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,200
this has everybody talking about something.

513
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,080
This is the point where I look my head into my hand and go, eh.

514
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,200
Let's talk about the story.

515
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,280
I'm going to read this article here.

516
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,960
It's from the San Diego Union-Tribune,

517
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,680
and it's by Brian E. Clark from the San Diego Union-Tribune

518
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:51,740
here, and it talks about the Poway Bowling Alley arcade replaces a game after youth protest

519
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,800
the images in the game. Jennifer Stoafen couldn't believe her eyes. There on the Dance Dance

520
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,680
Revolution machine, a video game immensely popular with preteens and teens were images

521
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:09,740
of drugs, alcohol, and a scantily clad nurse riding up and down on a syringe. I was appalled

522
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,260
to see that stuff flashing on the screen, said the 17-year-old

523
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,340
Stoeffen.

524
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,300
And she first saw the pictures way back in March

525
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,220
on the Dance Dance Revolution machine at the Poway Fun Ball.

526
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,700
She says, I'm a teenager, but I've seen

527
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,500
five-year-olds playing this game.

528
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,340
As far as I'm concerned, those images are totally unnecessary.

529
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,940
Why do they need to have pictures

530
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,620
with rows of pills, cocktails, ecstasy, and a syringe?

531
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,140
Now, I'd like to know how that girl knew that the pills were

532
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,380
ecstasy.

533
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,460
That just completely bad.

534
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,860
He was appalled, yet excited.

535
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,860
You're an upstanding person would know what that is.

536
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Probably seen five-year-olds naked, too.

537
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,860
All right.

538
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Well, let's talk about what she did.

539
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,860
She basically documented pictures, contacted the company that placed the game in the bowling alley,

540
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,860
and convinced the arcade owner to replace the machine.

541
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
We don't know with what.

542
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Beachhead!

543
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
It would be really, really funny...

544
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Sumo!

545
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,860
It would be really funny if it was Humpahorse.

546
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
That Namco horsey game.

547
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,100
2002, CJ. Final furlong.

548
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,660
So she basically got her way, she whined bitch to moan, and we shouldn't just say her because

549
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,560
obviously she got other people in on this too, her little coalition, which happens to

550
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,560
share a name with a very big lesbian, gay, bisexual coalition group, the Youth Advocacy

551
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,820
Coalition or whatever, just kind of a funny side note anyway. Probably lesbians and gays

552
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,140
wouldn't really care about DDR Solo 2000, they'd probably find it funny.

553
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,920
it should also be noted that and so a few thousand just like that movie the

554
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,940
last star for a recruit people for the army of satan

555
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,220
i mean it's wildly no no i signed up just last week

556
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,980
it would have a problem with looking at a nurse you're writing on a string not

557
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,540
at all

558
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,000
anyway so they go on to go out

559
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,300
we feel really good about what we were able to accomplish and she graduated

560
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,620
from high school she is a high school graduate good for her

561
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:11,620
And she's going to study film at San Jose State University, so I imagine her next target will probably be in San Jose somewhere.

562
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:18,620
Little kids or even teens don't need to see that stuff, and we were happy the business people we dealt with agreed with us too.

563
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,620
So the moral of the story, if you bitch and moan and you threaten to sue, you'll get your way.

564
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Watch out Sunnyvale, she's coming for you.

565
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,620
She's protesting these images, yet she's going to be a film student.

566
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Isn't that how, like, you know, independent filmmakers, like, win?

567
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Well, isn't- By being provocative.

568
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,620
How do we know she's not going- God-inducing.

569
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Sundance is showing breath!

570
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,620
Is she gonna get Sundance shut down for showing titties?

571
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,620
But if the nudity is artistic, it's okay.

572
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,620
Like Kate Winslet in Titanic, that was artistic nudity.

573
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,620
It was ugly nudity also, but it was, you know, anyway.

574
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,620
it was

575
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,260
the whole thing is that

576
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,260
this particular organist the i don't get it's not just this organization of any

577
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,120
organization is that there's something out there that they don't like

578
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,760
they have to use

579
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,260
generalizations

580
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,100
and point out every last negative thing instead of any positivity that it might

581
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,660
promote

582
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,640
any personal ddr first positive aspects

583
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,720
you've got your exercise program right there i've been so many people to lose

584
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,880
weight on it. It encourages people to get out and do things. On top of that, there are

585
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,720
a lot of songs that have positive messages in there too. You know, there's just so much

586
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,020
positive about it and they have to focus on all the negativity so a lot of people have

587
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,520
to lose out because something crawled up their ass and died.

588
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Wait till solo 2004 comes out with the warded fetuses and crack whores in the background.

589
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Oh yeah.

590
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Can I be the devil's advocate?

591
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,320
Come here. Irene, you want to be the devil's advocate, come here and tie it into the microphone.

592
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,640
We want to hear this from the other presenter.

593
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
I would have loved to have gotten an interview

594
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,080
with this person, but I was too lazy.

595
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,320
So we'll maybe get one next week.

596
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,280
Ow.

597
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
Oh, what was I going to say?

598
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,100
You're going to be devil's advocate.

599
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,840
Yeah, I know.

600
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,760
I had a thought.

601
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,920
OK, you said that just because a band of people

602
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,960
got together and protested against something

603
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,080
means that they get their way.

604
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,640
But I think it's kind of like if there was a group of murderers

605
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,560
out there

606
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,120
of course that's going to be sickening to some people and they're going to band

607
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,140
together and kind of complain about these murderers

608
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,680
so i can't say that

609
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,700
i fully agree with

610
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,760
what you think about people that band together and complain about things

611
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,880
because

612
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,120
you know sometimes it's for good i mean this particular instance i don't feel so

613
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,520
strongly that i think she's wrong

614
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,520
but let's not say everyone that does that is terrible

615
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,360
that's about it

616
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,360
I guess so, Rob. Eat my ass. Yeah. So, any comments?

617
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
I'm talking like way loud.

618
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Yeah, that's okay.

619
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Any comments?

620
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
Uh, it's a very good point you're making.

621
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
You're wrong!

622
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I think that part of it just has to do with the fact that people are generally close-minded.

623
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,360
People aren't willing to accept an idea that might be different than their own.

624
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,360
And so they're going to stick to that one idea and think that everybody has to adhere to it.

625
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Where, you know, apparently we disagree. I mean, that's obvious, because we like DVR.

626
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,360
But, I mean, not just with that situation, but with a ton of situations in the world.

627
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,360
It's intolerance and just generally being closed-minded.

628
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,360
You know, I'm gonna be the devil's advocate for the devil's advocate.

629
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
Okay.

630
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I need to make another point.

631
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
We need to fill this damn show somehow, go for it.

632
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Let's just make this the Irene show.

633
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Okay, how about the people that were, you know, the kind of people that I can see being against is like the Nazis.

634
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,360
You know, at one time people thought the Nazis were cool.

635
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,360
I don't know if anybody here necessarily thought the Nazis were cool.

636
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Well not here, but back in the day.

637
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
I don't think Jewish people ever thought the Nazis were very cool.

638
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,360
That's because people were sheep.

639
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,360
That's another example of the sheep mentality I'm often fond of bringing up.

640
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,360
I think Adolf Hitler just had some insecurities because he only had one testicle.

641
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,360
And he's just like, fuck you all, I'm just going to kill everyone because I have one testicle.

642
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
How did you know he had one testicle?

643
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
You'll like to know.

644
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Well, it's been reported from unknown sources

645
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,280
sources cuz i just read a bunch of books and shut up. Nerd! You can read! Fuck you! At least I'm not a

646
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,320
geep. Like Paul. A geep? Yeah, he has a geep on his shirt. But yeah, so, I mean, I guess it just depends on

647
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:00,760
the situation, you know. It's circumstantial. If you have beliefs... Oh, that's my cue. I gotta go now. I'm just kidding.

648
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,760
You're saying if you have beliefs, continue?

649
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Oh, I don't know, the draft noise threw me off.

650
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah, if you have beliefs, wahhhh.

651
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Good point.

652
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I know, thanks, thanks.

653
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Yeah.

654
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I think the general moral of that is even though there are people who do

655
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,760
occasionally win to take away things, not necessarily take away things that

656
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,760
we enjoy, but just to inflict their closed-minded opinion on the masses,

657
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,960
there should always be the people who are willing to

658
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,200
you know, who stand against that, who are willing to say something, you know,

659
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,600
we don't think this is right. Okay. You have no right to censor our lives.

660
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,160
Yeah, and I also, like, one last thing, like, if they don't like it so much, why don't they just

661
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,840
not go there? That's my whole opinion. It's like, why

662
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,120
ruin the party for everybody else just because you have a problem with it?

663
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,440
Nobody is forcing you to play this game. You know, everyone's

664
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,160
so hip on, like, let's, you know, they, everyone puts disclaimers on things and stuff, you know,

665
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,640
and why, why is it that this particular incident they have to take away are fun? Oh, okay. Oh,

666
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,920
okay. Yeah, well, Brad, okay, go ahead. Okay, here's probably what the situation is for this

667
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,920
one. Okay, you said it's at a bowling alley. Well, I'm guessing it's probably someone that's part of

668
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,440
a league or a bowling league or something like that that sees a stupid game playing in the

669
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,240
background, when they're waiting between frames to bowl.

670
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Bowling for God.

671
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,600
Christian bowling.

672
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,120
Highway to pins to heaven.

673
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,280
Anyway, so probably it's just someone with nothing to do,

674
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,720
complain about something, if it wasn't arguing against people

675
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,520
killing whales or small animals or something like that.

676
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,240
And children.

677
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,920
Children, abortion or whatever.

678
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,160
I'm sure they would have picked on something else.

679
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,280
It's just like a starter to other things to debate about.

680
00:42:50,280 --> 00:43:01,280
So I just think, you know, it's probably no big deal, but like I've read on the responses for these, that not really anyone's worried about it and don't really think it's going to go too far, and I probably agree with them.

681
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Yeah, I don't see why the bowling alley owner decided to get rid of the game in the first place. I mean, it must not have been making him any money or something. There must be other factors involved.

682
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,680
The thing I see, like, let me be like the extremist here for a second.

683
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Okay.

684
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:25,440
Well, even on that one instance, that machine getting taken out is doing more damage to

685
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,200
a larger amount of people than the images on the machine are doing to the little kids,

686
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
I believe.

687
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,200
And let's be an extremist here and say that what if all the machines eventually do get

688
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,400
taken out, because this does go way too far, which I doubt it will.

689
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,400
then that's definitely doing even more damage to a large amount of people than the little images of syringes and naked women.

690
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Fucking A. You see more of that kind of stuff on TV anyway than you do on the frickin' machines and arcades.

691
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,400
And you don't have to take it to the bowling alleys? All the parents are drunk anyway, so who gives a shit?

692
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I know, but you don't want to watch their own kids so they put something that has syringes and stuff to babies for their kids.

693
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,400
The only other thing I can think of why the manager would agree with something is if it's supposed to be a family environment

694
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,220
and enough families banded together and said this is not the type of environment we want

695
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,220
our children around.

696
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
It's the Mormon Bowl.

697
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:24,120
Their protests might have actually had some credence with the manager, but even so, first

698
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,480
of all, they stand to lose money because I know for a fact DVR machines make a ton of

699
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
money.

700
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,200
And also, from having worked at three different arcades, I do know that they make those ratings

701
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,560
stickers.

702
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,800
You know how you have your ratings on your video games that they have at home?

703
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,600
They have those rating stickers for arcade machines.

704
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,320
Corporately owned arcades are actually required to have them.

705
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,440
At least, I know Namco did.

706
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm not too sure about Gotham, but I know that most of them do.

707
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:50,960
Rated M.

708
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
But they're serious.

709
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,880
I personally went through and put a lot of those stickers on machines

710
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,360
so that any parent who had their child with them could look at the machine,

711
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,480
look at the rating, and see if that's really something

712
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,160
that they wanted their kid to play.

713
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,880
Unfortunately, parents don't want to watch their children themselves

714
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
to do their job, so they let dark kids babysit their children for them.

715
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,880
It's the thing I notice at Golf Land all the time.

716
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,880
Parents bring their kids there, and then just

717
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,880
turn them loose. They run around everywhere. They're stomping on all sorts of machines,

718
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,880
and shooting things.

719
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,880
What's worst of all is that when we're playing on DDR, they

720
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,880
start coming and playing with us. It's like eight people playing on the machine at once because all these little kids

721
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,220
up on the rails because you're getting into my my chair i know i know i know

722
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,120
but

723
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,900
uh... why don't these parents watch the kids when they're when they drop them

724
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,560
off here then you would it be able to take an actor role in what they're

725
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,520
playing because if you just let your kids to lose there's way worse arcades

726
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,580
out there besides d r

727
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,600
this bowling alley i would like to know this boy only has like a police nine one

728
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,600
one machine we're shooting people in there

729
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,580
let's go to us and everything i don't have to get a life and hired and i have

730
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,440
to take me

731
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,600
what we've been together and think we're offended by the god people

732
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,320
we just needed to be a nice club because i i i i think any resources all day and

733
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,000
he's good horse raising values unconstitutional i say we just really are

734
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,400
and we all get a deal pet fuck you

735
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,020
when you get

736
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,760
i want to do my new york wasn't bad

737
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,360
i'm gonna throw at you now

738
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,360
Okay, yeah, we're weird.

739
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,360
Malnourished Neopets.

740
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I think, Rob...

741
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
Okay, yes?

742
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,360
I think it's about, we should, you know, definitely have my, my ramp.

743
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,360
Okay, we'll get, we'll get you your ramp after the next break.

744
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,360
I'm gonna go look at the account if I can.

745
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:40,360
Okay.

746
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,360
However, I, I was gonna make a point and I just forgot it, so I guess I won't make a point.

747
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,360
I guess...

748
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
What point's at Cal Expo?

749
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,360
What do you guys think's gonna happen after this?

750
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,360
After what?

751
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
You think that more machines are gonna get taken out from other places?

752
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,360
No.

753
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,880
Do you think this, I mean, this person said they're gonna go on to DDR Freak, which is

754
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,680
probably the most well-known DDR site that's out there.

755
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,960
Go look at their machine locations page and start hitting every Solo 2000 machine out

756
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
there.

757
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
Did you see how many were on there?

758
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
A lot.

759
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,440
I think, honestly, the owners of these places, they've had them long enough to know, you

760
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,160
know, what's going on in the game.

761
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,760
They've had them long enough to know the kind of content is inside, you know, and there's,

762
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,740
You know, I think they would have taken him out by now if they really felt passionately

763
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
about that.

764
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,920
And here comes Brad.

765
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
And here's Matt.

766
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
He hasn't finished.

767
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Thank you.

768
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,280
Actually, I think what's going to happen is these people are going to call up these establishments

769
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,240
with the Solo 2000 machines, and they're just going to get laughed at.

770
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,060
Because these people are going to be like, yeah, I'm just going to take this machine

771
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:45,240
that I paid a couple grand for and just get rid of it because you don't like it.

772
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,740
Okay, go screw yourself.

773
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,120
That's what they're probably going to end up saying.

774
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,340
It's just ridiculous to even try to take these machines out because of a few images of flash

775
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,700
in the background that you don't even notice anyways.

776
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,780
Which I'm sure they'd be like, oh, it's subliminal then.

777
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,780
They don't notice it.

778
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:05,580
It gets in their subconscious and they'll become murderers and rapists.

779
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,580
Just one thing, though.

780
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:12,460
I mean, it may be a sad thing, I should say, but unfortunately greed ruins over morality

781
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,460
in a lot of cases.

782
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:21,460
I mean, are you going to throw away an income of well into the thousands because it offends somebody?

783
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,460
I mean, true, there's some offensive material that I think should be removed on occasion,

784
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:32,460
but on top of that, though, this is an instance where this small group is not really going to be able to make much of a difference.

785
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,460
I mean, true, right?

786
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,460
Yeah, I agree, and in fact, also, let's just say, for instance, that they do get away with it.

787
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Solo 2000 gone. Really, would you miss it? I wouldn't miss it.

788
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:50,460
I mean, it was just, I don't miss the game. I don't even care if they get rid of it.

789
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,460
Good for them. Get a better game. Get a Max 2 machine. Hell, I mean...

790
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,460
Well, okay, but, okay, say you go and upgrade the Solo 2000 to a fourth mix, okay?

791
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,460
Look at the background and kick the can. It's a bunch of flying heroin needles.

792
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,460
You've still got the same thing going on.

793
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,460
I still think Sinkorondavoo has the best video.

794
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Yeah, that's right! Then they'll just want a Max 2 machine removed because there's lesbians all over the secret rendezvous video, and it's a secret message that everybody should become a lesbian.

795
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
Lesbians.

796
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Okay.

797
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:28,460
You know, Solo 2000 is a good machine, you know. It's fun, it attracts crowds, people actually go look for them.

798
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,460
We have a new face to the show, Glenn would like to contribute an opinion.

799
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,460
I just completely lost my train of thought.

800
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:39,740
Here's the thing about the whole, because basically what it is, it's censorship.

801
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,640
And censorship never stops, it just keeps going further and further and further and

802
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,300
nobody's going to be happy until there's nothing left because somebody will be offended by

803
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,300
something.

804
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:55,180
Either it's degradation of women by the songs or images or whether it's subliminal messages

805
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,260
that they think they hear or drug use or anything, it will never end.

806
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:07,260
So if they keep, if it's a trend and they keep caving in to these people, then DDR will

807
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,060
be gone and then there will be something next after that.

808
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,300
So a message to all you arcade owners out there, grow some balls!

809
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Only in America.

810
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,860
Wash your pussies!

811
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,620
And a message out there also as well to the coalition there that's taking out all the

812
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,620
machines out there.

813
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,500
First, we would love to hear your opinion, so please contact the station and we'll give

814
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,860
you a fair interview and some equal time and let you present your side of the story because

815
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,380
we're curious what your motivations are and maybe you can talk us out of playing DDR.

816
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:43,420
Yeah, yeah. Anyway. That was funny. Second off to the coalition, there's a place called

817
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,900
Laser Force in Sacramento. Go take their machine. If you need a place to properly deposit this

818
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:55,860
machine, I live at. Alright, anyway. We'll talk more about Laser Force and other evil

819
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,460
all the money things when we come back uh... in the meantime we're gonna play

820
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,700
something from drum mania

821
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,860
replace something from what i think it's our freaks also

822
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,880
we're gonna play uh... our namesake here at the lovely orange lounge and their

823
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,100
little medley from the new guitar

824
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,860
yes very good i really don't worry here we go

825
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:21,860
we'll be back in about five minutes

826
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,860
I can't believe it, a little sharp though.

827
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Let's get this thing off the ground

828
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:42,260
One day when I got hungry, I told you with a cough I had to be shit, Uncle Ghandi

829
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,860
Cool it, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle

830
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,660
Uncle Dandy, he is me

831
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,460
He's the type of Spider-Man

832
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,260
And I know that he will help me

833
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,060
As much as he can

834
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,260
The type of Spider-Man is what I want to be

835
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,860
But there are no cut-in birds who want to ride with me

836
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,460
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on the line

837
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,060
But every speed in kakuta is fine

838
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,660
Kakuta

839
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:10,060
I am the type of spider in kakuta

840
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,520
I find my little sexy and he's a good pal

841
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,060
Sexy, sexy, sexy and he's a good pal

842
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,560
Boy, I'm a sexy girl, that's my aim

843
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,860
I love to fly the taxi, I like it very much

844
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,360
Even though I have no license, I always find a clutch

845
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,860
I can bind it off my head, I can bind it off my feet

846
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,860
And I have no problem getting better than me

847
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,860
And the sexy time is my game

848
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:25,860
I am a sexy diamond man, I am a sexy diamond man, I am a sexy diamond man.

849
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,860
My bad.

850
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:33,860
And now I would like to present to you the comic stylings of Irene, future comedian extraordinaire.

851
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,860
Keep clapping, I'm kidding.

852
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,200
so these uh... two muffins were uh... baking in the oven

853
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,480
and uh...

854
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,900
the first one says to the other one

855
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,200
you know it's getting pretty hot in here

856
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,560
and the second one's like

857
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:58,560
holy shit the talking muffin

858
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,560
Yeah

859
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

860
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,560
is

861
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,560
is

862
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,560
is

863
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,560
is

864
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,560
do

865
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,560
do

866
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,560
do

867
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:52,560
I'm just a disturbed guy.

868
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:48,440
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We're live for our very first show. It's about

869
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,040
eight o'clock. We're halfway through it. What do you know? We made it this far. So let's

870
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,080
if we can get to the other end.

871
01:02:54,080 --> 01:03:00,160
I think now would be a good time in the show for Jamie to be given space to do her little

872
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
rant.

873
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
How does that sound, Jamie?

874
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
That sounds delightful.

875
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,160
All right.

876
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,160
Let's hear it.

877
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,160
Let's hear your little rant for the week.

878
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,720
This is Jamie's big fuck you unbelief.

879
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:15,000
That goes to, I would have to say, parents at Roseville Golf Land.

880
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,880
Who agrees with me here?

881
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Especially one delightful lady who I saw putting her three-year-old child on the keyboard mania machine to change a diaper.

882
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Now, I knew a lot of people called that a shitty game, but...

883
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,880
She was checking his diaper, but she put the child on the keyboard, and I couldn't help myself but go up there and go,

884
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,880
I would go up there and go, excuse me, ma'am, and mentally I was going, and I used the term loosely,

885
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,880
would you mind moving your child off of this machine?

886
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,880
Or I could go get management and make them, you know, have you pay for it.

887
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,880
And she just looked at me.

888
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
Oh, duh, I'm sorry.

889
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,880
That was, yeah, that was a derp moment.

890
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,880
But, you know, that has me thinking.

891
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,880
You know, we're missing a whole keyboard on one side.

892
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
We're missing keys on player one.

893
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,040
you know our drum mania machine was screwed up for a while at you know

894
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,760
guitar freaks is none of their issues

895
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,580
although I did see a parent walk off while their

896
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,080
three-year-old, not three-year-old, more like a five-year-old was holding one of those

897
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,720
big guitar controllers

898
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,920
which I have issues holding. Mommy it hurts. It feels like

899
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,440
burning. But you know and I actually caught

900
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,760
those, I was playing drum mania at the time, I called the parent back and said you need to get your

901
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,920
you know you need to help your child because if they drop this on their foot they will likely

902
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,200
break their toes. Attention to parents at Golf Land. This goes for not just Roseville

903
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,480
Golf Land, but any golf land. And the arcades. Because Jamie circulates a lot. She gets around,

904
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:51,920
Jamie. Oh yeah, baby. And the many different arcades. If you don't mother your child, Jamie

905
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,920
will. Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, god damn it, I will.

906
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,760
But no, the whole issue, you know, there's like parents who let their little children

907
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,620
run loose and they get on the DDR machine. Like when we were at, um, Scandia. The little

908
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:10,080
child that got up behind me and I nearly stepped on this kid.

909
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
And I mean, I felt...

910
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
You did step on her in there, didn't you?

911
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
I think I did.

912
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,800
But, you know, I turned around, I found her, I think it was her aunt, but I, you know,

913
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,320
I gave her my tokens to, you know, let her know I felt bad, but...

914
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,320
Because it's not the kid's fault.

915
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,320
Well, I mean, it is...

916
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,320
They don't really know any better, but if their parents aren't doing their job, how

917
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,880
are they ever going to learn?

918
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,880
You know, like that prime example of the people we got kicked out of golf in the other night?

919
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,880
Oh God.

920
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,320
You know, they were getting up, bumming around the machine, we had management kick them out.

921
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,820
what we actually got a restraining order that night

922
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,360
we have got a golf land restraining order tonight i was awesome

923
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,140
but i was having a problem are part of the scene while i was playing annually

924
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:50,440
whacked in the face one and then his they can if you make a decision to get

925
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,780
almost hit with your ass

926
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,080
deluxe no that was when i stuck my fist out to do the side of the i mean you

927
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,180
know how you have to figure handouts but i don't know how many parlous we have

928
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,000
listening but

929
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,540
you seek out your hand side aside to do two lots

930
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,040
and i nearly palm the guy in the face

931
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,520
and i thought it was it because he was a moron itself

932
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,440
you know i can't go ready to give it to the people i fear of my hand off

933
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,440
simple

934
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,020
i'll tell you that that's that's the red you know

935
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,420
if we have any parents who are listening to show a seriously doubt it

936
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:25,180
but still if you have younger siblings you know make sure

937
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,340
and then someone's got an eye on them you know look out for the little less

938
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,260
because we sure as hell are

939
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:33,560
it's not our jobs if they're not your children

940
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,040
Yeah, we're going to step on them, and then they'll learn.

941
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,280
But I don't know, I would not consciously

942
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,240
step on a little child if I couldn't help it.

943
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,400
Anyway, that's my rant.

944
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,000
If you'd like to comment on Jamie's Fuck You of the Week,

945
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,160
or you'd like to comment on anything else we talked

946
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,540
about in the past hour of the show,

947
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,440
I encourage you to join our chat room, which is located

948
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:01,600
on server IRC.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net.

949
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,280
And it's just Channel Orange Lounge, all one word.

950
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,560
So we look forward to seeing you in there.

951
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,280
And we'll take your comments and maybe talk about some of

952
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,240
them on the show.

953
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,840
In future weeks on the Orange Lounge, we are looking into

954
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,440
getting the phone system here so we can take

955
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,240
phone calls on the air.

956
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,800
But we're kind of doing some test runs to see what kind of

957
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,920
reception the show gets for you.

958
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,920
Because that's going to be a large investment to get the

959
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,440
phones here.

960
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,000
So it might be a little while before we get those.

961
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,360
But we'd like to start taking phone calls.

962
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,560
That'll be cool.

963
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,240
All right.

964
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,520
Other things we wanted to talk about.

965
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:41,520
Jamie, before we went into the break, we talked about we were sending out a message to the little coalition there, the little anti-DDR army, the anti-DDR army in San Diego that's taking out Solo2K machines.

966
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:49,520
I recommended their next target be Laser Force in Sacramento, and I thought you might want to take this opportunity, because you've already initiated a local boycott.

967
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,520
Yes.

968
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,520
Now you can initiate a national boycott at Laser Force. International.

969
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,520
The one issue with that is that I don't want them to go targeting every place that has a solo.

970
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,520
Like the Walmart and Lodi.

971
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,520
Now the Walmart and Lodi rules.

972
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,520
Yes it does.

973
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,520
Any place you can buy Pringles and then go straight to play DDR just rules.

974
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Thank you.

975
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,520
And I won so many toys out of the crane machines there, it's not even funny.

976
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,520
But let's hear why Laser Force sucks. Tell your Laser Force story.

977
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,760
really supposed to have to do last night

978
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,600
with uh... the date that uh... iguana girl

979
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,820
and i and

980
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:28,620
a certain and names

981
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:32,440
well cockspanker

982
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,040
correct figure for bucks

983
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,600
to and is no longer worthy of any more

984
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,720
we are going to have laser force

985
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:46,880
check out the new solo machine right around the corner from my house

986
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,200
and people please don't come to my house anyway

987
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,380
we go in and you know we're all playing nobody's getting up and doing anything

988
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,400
and you know this woman's asking questions you know we're answering she's

989
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,840
got her kids there and then this group of little girls gets up by the machine

990
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,040
and we've all been taking our turns and using a coin line anyone with common

991
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,480
sense can see what a coin line is

992
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,040
um... eventually the mother got up and was complaining that oh you know my kid

993
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,720
wanted to get up here and you know we explained the coin line and we're like okay well you

994
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,600
we're gonna go ahead let your kid go we'll go ahead and you know trade this

995
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,720
turn just give us some tokens because we'd already had tokens in machine and

996
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,680
she's like no I gotta go and they left and then management came up and just

997
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:32,600
like tried to ream us we were being they were being very oh my goodness I can't

998
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:43,740
believe it everything's ruined as many times as I can fit it in anyway anyway

999
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:51,260
We had issues with them. Basically, we just said we weren't going to come back and I made

1000
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:56,740
sure to let everybody I knew. And so far, I think we've had a fairly successful boycott,

1001
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:01,540
haven't we? I mean, I understand that their business isn't doing very well. But I mean,

1002
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:07,020
it's just though nobody really plays the solo there anyway, so they should just give me the

1003
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:13,100
machine and then we wouldn't have to boycott them anymore. That is crime logic.

1004
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:19,100
But then that woman is going to have to come to your house and remove the machine because she finds it offensive.

1005
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,100
Hey, it's my house.

1006
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,100
Yes, but the poor furniture. It's offended.

1007
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,100
Hey, Jamie has a guard cap.

1008
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,100
Yes, Shermy would kill her.

1009
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,100
Shermy would roll around on the floor and out-cube her or something.

1010
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:39,100
But no, if somebody came to my house saying you can't play this in your own home,

1011
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,500
the point i'd break out the katana and decapitate somebody, okay?

1012
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,700
Oh, it's evil, Jamie, ladies and gentlemen. It's in my house, it's self-defense.

1013
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,680
Jamie's on! Jamie's on! No!

1014
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,260
Oh, oh, the steroids!

1015
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,860
Making me feel badly!

1016
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,300
I like that, uh...

1017
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,540
Laser Force sucks. I mean,

1018
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:04,140
I'm sorry, the only official laser tag game that I can, you know,

1019
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,900
put my name behind is

1020
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:10,340
Cuzar, played for four years, spent a good fifteen grand there.

1021
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,540
We should say that Loki was a Cuzar nerd long before he was a DER nerd.

1022
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,820
And we need to hear it between Zach.

1023
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:19,940
Yes, Cuzar, it was my first love.

1024
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,540
Once Cuzar left

1025
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,620
last year around May, I was very sad, still sad to this day.

1026
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,300
And anyways,

1027
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,020
DDR became my new addiction.

1028
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,020
I just have to say, Q's are rules, Laser Force sucks ass, and they were almost out of business

1029
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,780
just when Q's are went and left, and then they came back to, like, a festering, uh,

1030
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:50,660
sore. So, they can die. It really does smell like pee in there. And they smell like pee.

1031
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:55,540
I'm glad I'm not the only person that noticed how bad it stinks in there. But we know, keep

1032
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:00,100
in mind though, we've also got, um, Laser X at Country Club Lanes, and we still have

1033
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,520
whatever thing is that golf land

1034
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,460
i'm sorry you're talking about laser x

1035
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,720
that there are alternate there are local alternatives to laser force yes if you

1036
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,560
have to shoot the infrared beam at somebody

1037
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,840
and no unfortunately i do not have dramatic music to play when people are

1038
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,700
are crying over a lot their losses

1039
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:24,000
but i do have cam laughter

1040
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,880
yeah

1041
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,760
anyway yet if you don't know if last year i hope we can play flowers for

1042
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,920
albion

1043
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,780
oh yeah i can i could look at one of them

1044
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,740

crying

1051
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:57,700
let's bring them over here i would ask for a quick prayer

1052
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,320
delivery of the microphone

1053
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,860
you know you have all the mike faraway from you because it it's very sensitive

1054
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,760
it's like a penis it's very sensitive

1055
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,620
i'm like you and i don't get too close to the head or you're getting shot

1056
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:09,100
anyway

1057
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,820
uh...

1058
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,220
it

1059
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,980
i don't want to hear about you and when i got a day if you ever played

1060
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,380

1061
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,580
yet i have a and what do you think

1062
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,000
it's a penis and the contest is that

1063
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,480
that jimmy doesn't have a penis last time i checked

1064
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,240
but i can't get into the contest

1065
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,840
uh...

1066
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,280
i can make one

1067
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,720
what do you think of this whole thing this is my show this this house that you

1068
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,560
i would like to be transformed

1069
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,800
my heart has a complete disaster area right now being overran

1070
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,920
by a bunch of g

1071
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,840
and i am a way to get that i need

1072
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,760
and back in the middle of it

1073
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,760
You're now an honorary geek. You're the meat in the geek sandwich.

1074
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,260
Oh, that was just a bad image.

1075
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:05,760
I was just not somewhere I wanted to be.

1076
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,760
Brian and Meat at the same time

1077
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,760
quotes Irene.

1078
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,760
And followed by a

1079
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Very descriptive. Any comments you want to add out there to the Bahmani people listening?

1080
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,760
Because we have quite a few people listening right now.

1081
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,760
Is there anything you want to say to the addicts out there of Imani?

1082
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,760
Besides the fact that they turn my house completely upside down when you throw these types of things?

1083
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,760
And that I'm going, I have no house and no life right now?

1084
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Well, there's a pool. You could go swim.

1085
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Here's a ball, Brian. Why don't you go bounce it?

1086
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,760
I actually want to thank you very much for the use of this.

1087
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,760
Yay, Brian!

1088
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,760
I can edit in your honor.

1089
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Awww.

1090
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,760
It's a pink dinosaur.

1091
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,760
Okay, that's it. Thanks for being on the show, Brian. We appreciate it.

1092
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,760
Woo, Brian!

1093
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,760
I'm the only one clapping!

1094
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,760
Yeah, and you don't have a microphone.

1095
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,760
What now? Let's get away from Bahmani. You're right, we can't fill two hours with Bahmani.

1096
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,760
Yes, we can.

1097
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,760
Or what do you want to talk about then?

1098
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,760
Bahmani.

1099
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,860
We were talking about you know what our personal cross-dresser is not here tonight

1100
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:25,700
Yeah, right. It was supposed to be here tonight. We had our cross-dressing fellow admin is not here tonight. Where's that?

1101
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:31,180
I knew he had our cross-dressing para playing para somewhere. I knew he had to work today

1102
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:37,380
So maybe he didn't show up because of that. Oh, you know, he's out working at what what corner is he working today? He's uh,

1103
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,060
That would probably be one of the corners of the par machine

1104
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:52,060
But if my Ototo-chan is listening tonight, dude, get here. Let's fill it with witty banter.

1105
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,060
Okay.

1106
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,060
Okay.

1107
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:59,060
Well, you come on. What do you want to talk about? Is there anything, Imani, you really want to talk about?

1108
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,060
Yeah, sure. How about Matt say something?

1109
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:11,420
I'd like to announce for all those people that do play The Sims out there for DWI, actually,

1110
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:17,380
Bimani Ruler, you might know him from DDR Mania X, he's having a blitz for the next

1111
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,380
two weeks.

1112
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:22,540
He's going to be releasing a new file every day and if anyone hasn't played his stuff,

1113
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:23,540
do play it.

1114
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,540
It's awesome.

1115
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:32,440
Today, in fact, his release was the Classic Party Triathlon, which I have to say was awesome.

1116
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,200
So go try that and that's it.

1117
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,720
Everyone watch the webcam because every once in a while something crazy is going to pop

1118
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:46,120
up, something out of control, something you didn't expect, something crazy and wild.

1119
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:51,120
If you'd like to visit our webcam just go to our website at http colon slash slash orange

1120
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,400
lounge dot sky S-K-I-E dot C-X and it's right there in the upper right corner.

1121
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,640
It's a little tricky to find but if you look you'll find it and there's a little thing

1122
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,640
that will take you to the webcam.

1123
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,640
Unfortunately we're being ghetto this week and the page doesn't refresh. You have to reload it every minute or so.

1124
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,640
But we'll have that fixed for next week. Because we just got the website finished today.

1125
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:14,640
A big hand to Glen. A big thank you to Glen for finishing the website.

1126
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,640
And Brad comes back from the webcam room with this weird grin on his face.

1127
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,640
Should we fear? Should we be scared?

1128
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,640
Maybe you should look at the cam. Hopefully it got cut.

1129
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,640
It looks like somebody's parrying the deluxe.

1130
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,640
That's Brian playing DDR after he just...

1131
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,640
Brian's playing DDR after he was just in here slamming the rest of us.

1132
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
I know, now he's going...

1133
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,640
See, it's more truth that Bemani just owns everybody. I'm sorry.

1134
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
I think I have DDR.

1135
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,640
Okay, Paul goes to play DDR now.

1136
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,640
Where's my picture?

1137
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,640
Okay.

1138
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,640
Anyway, so were we going to...

1139
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,640
I have an idea.

1140
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Irene has an idea.

1141
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,640
I was going to talk...

1142
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,640
Okay, go ahead.

1143
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
What were you going to say?

1144
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,640
Obviously, we can talk about Max 2, because that's like what everybody talks about these days.

1145
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,640
We have Burning Heat now.

1146
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,640
We just unlocked Burning Heat yesterday, which is kind of a big deal.

1147
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,640
It's really the only song anybody seems to care about in Max 2, is Burning Heat.

1148
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,640
And Kakumei, but Kakumei kind of...

1149
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,640
It was the big deal in the beginning, but then as people started unlocking Burning Heat, it was just like,

1150
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,640
Oh my god, Burning Heat!

1151
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,640
Burning Heat makes me cum.

1152
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,640
So what do you guys think about Max 2? What do you guys think about...

1153
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,640
Max 2 was the first new DDR that I had a reason to get excited over.

1154
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:32,640
Max 2 is everything that Max should have been, and I think that's kind of been the opinion across the board,

1155
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,640
because it's got way more songs than 5th Mix had. Well, no, I'm sorry, it's got about the same amount of songs as 5th Mix had.

1156
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,640
But Max had, like, 40 songs. It had nothing. Max had way more, it was nice.

1157
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,640
So what's missing from Max 2 that you'd like to see in our next installment of DDR?

1158
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,640
In Max 3, if they should actually take it that far?

1159
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:55,000
ability to have flat dark mode, flat dark mode, gives dark and flat run on the same

1160
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,900
modifiers, so you can't use them both. I think, you know, we should be able to have

1161
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:06,960
more songs and less, maybe not less ONI modes, but make ONI modes, make more ONI modes accessible

1162
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,640
at first and not unlocking a lot of ONI modes, because I notice we unlock a lot of ONI modes

1163
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,080
and hardly any of them are songs. I think they're either even between ONI and

1164
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:23,680
And I think people want more songs to play because Oni mode is, I guess in my opinion,

1165
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:28,000
a little bit harder for people because it's a perfect attack thing, you know, or a great

1166
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
attack.

1167
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
But it's the challenge.

1168
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah, it's really hard.

1169
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,360
Now, remember in fourth mix how they had the, you could come home and make your own non-stops

1170
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,840
on the home version of the third mix and save it to the card and then take it to the arcade

1171
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,840
and play your own non-stop?

1172
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,640
They should do something like that for Oni.

1173
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,440
I can see why they hesitate doing it because then everybody would just make a ten song non-stop

1174
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,440
of a bunch of basics.

1175
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,840
able to stay on the machine all day, but maybe limit it, the homemade non-stops to as many

1176
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,440
songs as you would have on the normal game.

1177
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,440
Yeah, or maybe a certain amount of sets you have to have in a song or something like that.

1178
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,120
I actually think that it might work better to do something very similar to how 2DX has

1179
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:10,120
it. You know, have an expert course, where, I mean, an expert course in the sense that

1180
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,800
the BeatMania expert courses are in, where you have the following percentage.

1181
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,040
In the chat room, Joe Mama suggesting that we just have only maniacs.

1182
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,640
If you put a song out there on the Oni mode, you can only put in maniac stuff.

1183
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,800
That's a good idea.

1184
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
But then there's people out there that maybe want to play Oni,

1185
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,600
they can't play maniacs.

1186
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,160
Do you think that they maybe should have had an easy Oni chorus?

1187
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,680
I know, exactly.

1188
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,560
Just playing devil's advocate.

1189
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,840
What I'd like to see would be to have actually more unlockable stuff.

1190
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,320
Not necessarily more songs.

1191
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,760
I mean, more songs obviously would be great.

1192
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,400
But let's say, for instance, we can have different sets for a song being

1193
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:49,360
added in or something like that or maybe even, I don't know, just have like sort of a challenge

1194
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,980
mode where you play and you get more points, you know, to go towards, you know, unlocking

1195
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:58,640
songs but have it be like a certain really hard, strange thing that you haven't seen

1196
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,720
before or even, you know, bringing back solo via Megamixes where you have three songs,

1197
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,720
you know, play together.

1198
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,280
Megamixes are pretty cool. That's something I'd like to see come back.

1199
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,280
Megamixes.

1200
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,280
Hey.

1201
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,560
You remember how in Solo 2000, which is getting way too much talk time on the show tonight,

1202
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:21,560
One course had Afro Nova, Dropout, and I think Wild Rush, and the cool thing about it is it wasn't just a non-stop, the songs actually mixed together.

1203
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,560
That's pretty neat.

1204
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,560
I remember that.

1205
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,560
I guess, we'll go ahead and finish the talk because I'm going to change the subject a little.

1206
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Oh, okay. Well, about the different steps, like Matt was saying, what I kind of missed was, it was kind of cool, I think it was on one of the versions of Third Mix, there was alternate steps for some of the songs.

1207
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,560
You would press, I think it was like, down, down, you know.

1208
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:45,560
It was the Club of Pen Steps, actually. They had it for, like, Brilliant To You, Keep On Me. I'd love to see some of that come back.

1209
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:50,560
What about new stuff? We've been talking about, like, a lot of old stuff we'd like to see make a return.

1210
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,560
How do you think Konami can keep DDR kind of innovative?

1211
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,560
Because let's look at Five Key. Five Key's gonna be dying this time with the release of Final.

1212
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,560
Unless they decide to do something with Beat Mania 3, because Beat Mania 3 is a Five Key series.

1213
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,560
But for all practical purposes, the original five key series is kind of gone.

1214
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,560
So how can Konami prevent themselves from releasing a DDR final?

1215
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,560
What can they do to keep...

1216
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,560
They could put a foot pedal.

1217
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,560
On DDR?

1218
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,560
No, I've often thought that they need to do partner solo.

1219
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,560
Well, you know, have the six panels solo set up, but with two players.

1220
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,560
I mean, instead of having the linked machines like they work now,

1221
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,560
but not if you put enough space in between the machine.

1222
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:43,560
Or set it up like the three-player Para Para, where you have three panels, with the large monitor in the front, DDR could be made to accommodate that.

1223
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,560
And have it with solo.

1224
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:52,560
I would like to see DDR on a humongous screen, like, I say pump it up, is on a huge screen.

1225
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,560
I just don't like, though, how...

1226
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,560
Go to Fry.

1227
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,560
I don't like it.

1228
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,560
Oh, I don't like, I don't like the setup.

1229
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,320
That's something, that's something that's worth talking about here if you want to change

1230
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,320
something for a little bit.

1231
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,320
We'll talk about that when we come back for break.

1232
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,320
Let's stay there for a little bit.

1233
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,320
Let's keep talking about Max.

1234
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,320
Max is a magical...

1235
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,440
A giant, I think, the thing I don't like about Pump is it's got a huge screen but then it's

1236
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,200
got this humongous box that just kind of sits out there and the screen goes back.

1237
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,920
It's like looking at the end of a tunnel to see what you're looking at.

1238
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,920
It's kind of odd.

1239
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,920
I think, I'd like it to look more like 2DX versus a giant freaking huge...

1240
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,400
I think you're too tall for Pump It Up.

1241
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:30,240
I'm too tall. Another of the names you can add to it would be more modifiers to like,

1242
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:35,960
say for instance, stuff you can do with the arrows. Like have them all mixed up, have

1243
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,680
some things I thought even for doing some of my edits and stuff. Maybe even have it

1244
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,920
where like stuff in the background kind of helps you, you know, not be able to see the

1245
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,280
arrows just right. You know, have a bunch of arrows all of a sudden appear in the background.

1246
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,560
Just crazy shit like that. Well, it's kind of a lot of people say Flash in the Night

1247
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:56,440
was like that on max because it would go flash, the screen would do this seizure thing, like

1248
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,480
amazing seizure robots, flash. And then it was kind of hard to see your arrows, so.

1249
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:06,400
They also need to put in like super random mode like they have in 7x guitar freaks, where

1250
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,080
like in normal shuffle mode, like all the up arrows become something like left, down,

1251
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:15,440
or right. But you can have them so all the arrows are completely random, so they'd still

1252
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,760
appear in the same place, but they'd all be completely random and not appear in any way.

1253
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:25,520
figure out some way to shuffle double steps because I'm just sick of being able to only

1254
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:34,520
play it on regular or play it on mirror. And really that's just the same. Yeah. Yes. I

1255
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:40,920
had a dumb idea once because I'm terrible at... Now Irene, no idea is a dumb idea. Oh,

1256
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,460
wait till you hear this. This is pretty stupid. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm terrible at freestyling

1257
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:53,220
So I always thought it would be so cool if they put a screen on the back of DDR so that you could turn around and not fuck up.

1258
01:24:53,220 --> 01:25:02,700
Because I remember when I first played Only You, and I tried to turn around again, and I totally messed up because I don't know how to freestyle.

1259
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:06,460
Well, that's part of freestyling, is learning how to turn around.

1260
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,460
Now, I know you have issues with Mirror, but...

1261
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:14,700
You know, I fucking hate Mirror. Mirror is the devil.

1262
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:18,980
uh... okay uh... what i meant was like you know just if you want to turn around

1263
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:25,120
and start doing that there is some shit like that you know i can't look at a

1264
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,980
step chart and know what i'm doing because

1265
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,220
i'm a complete return but i think you're saying that they should make a a

1266
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,220
freestyle for dummies machine yes yes

1267
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,820
do you have to think that if you are a cell bdr some shit like that i guess

1268
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:43,300
that's a possibility of the expensive but i think that i don't know how

1269
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,400
they would be able to pull it off like it would block the view of people who

1270
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,180
want to watch anyway so

1271
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,580
that'd be kind of pointless

1272
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,940
and the bars would

1273
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,480
obviously pose a problem because some people need bars

1274
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,180
somebody in the back of the room is yelling and you can't hear it over the

1275
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:02,120
microphone suggesting that they just take the bars off the next DDR mix

1276
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,880
there is going to be a tournament coming up in august i happen to know there's

1277
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,060
going to be a tournament in concord at mountain mikes that they are taking the

1278
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,000
bar off the machine for freestyle

1279
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,540
that should be pretty cool

1280
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,620
uh... a lot more details on that assess their announce looking at the chair in

1281
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:20,020
here we've got your mama suggesting that they have the care of a different speed

1282
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,480
for like a modifier you can tell you care of the gutter that would be crazy i

1283
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,860
don't know i thought was a little too weird

1284
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,100
it is any

1285
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:32,720
besides adding new panels uh... adding new screens bigger screens or anything

1286
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,080
konami could do to the game itself to make it more interesting or do they

1287
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,960
pretty much just have to trash the whole damn thing and start over actually i got

1288
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,960
I've got another idea. Kind of similar with Para Para where you have set routines to do.

1289
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,960
Maybe set something up like have a freestyle mode or something where they actually have a set routine for a song.

1290
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,960
Freestyle for dummies.

1291
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,960
Yeah, basically. You know, kind of get ideas or something.

1292
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,960
White people dancing mode.

1293
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,960
Exactly.

1294
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,960
Teaching you how to do country line dancing.

1295
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:04,960
I wouldn't imagine this would actually be a new DDR, but you know, they've got Para Para, they have DDR.

1296
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,200
do something that combines the both together where you have like maybe a

1297
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:12,640
sensitive panel beneath you plus the sensors above soon it's not just where

1298
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,380
you wave your hands or how hard you are where you're stepping but you are doing

1299
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:21,680
everything and you memorize their dances or you just have to be in the right

1300
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:26,080
place at the right time you know I was thinking um this might sound kind of I

1301
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,960
don't know if I'd explain it right but I was thinking maybe they'd add like mini

1302
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,840
panels maybe where you could do like little hand plants you know maybe I could

1303
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,560
have like the floor, little moles would come up out of the floor and you could step on

1304
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
them with your feet.

1305
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,560
Maybe that spider stomp.

1306
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,680
No, you know, maybe that should be it, maybe they should just make the whole thing like

1307
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
a-

1308
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,680
You know what?

1309
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,360
The hell with DDR, we want Spider Stomp 2DX.

1310
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,360
How's that sound?

1311
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,360
No.

1312
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,360
No, no.

1313
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,560
How about they just get rid of actual panels and they just make the whole pad pressure

1314
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,560
sensitive.

1315
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
So-

1316
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,560
Pressure sensitive?

1317
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,560
That would be an interesting-

1318
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:08,560
And like the whole thing would be just one huge panel, and then you could kind of freestyle that way and they can put arrows wherever they want.

1319
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,560
It would be like Saturday Night Fever, where you got the light up dance floor. Wouldn't that be cool?

1320
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,560
Uh, I don't think I'm going to be somewhere else.

1321
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,560
More thoughts?

1322
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:26,560
That's just my two cents. I was thinking maybe Konami should just give us all free machines. Yeah, I'd like that.

1323
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,560
Do you hear us? Come on in and hook us up.

1324
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:02,560
In the meantime, this is for Dark Tetsuya in the chat room with some Jerry Halliwell from X2. Here you go.

1325
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,560
The street's the place to go

1326
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,560
Just a night for the first time

1327
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,560
Just about as bad as

1328
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,560
For the first time in history

1329
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,560
God's got greatness

1330
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,560
It's greatness

1331
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,560
Hallelujah, it's greatness

1332
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,560
Amen, it's greatness

1333
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:21,680
Hallelujah, it's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men

1334
01:31:54,560 --> 01:32:12,560
I think about you almost every day My mind is made up, I see you night and day

1335
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:19,560
You're my obsession but I'll wait in line I'll pretend for till then that I'm doing fine

1336
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,560
And I know that my feelings show, but I guess that's the way to let you know I'm in

1337
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,560
What else can I do?

1338
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,560
You are my fantasy, you are my energy

1339
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,560
Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

1340
01:32:44,560 --> 01:33:06,560
I was waiting for the moment in time And the moment came up to make you mine

1341
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:13,560
I gotta have ya, I need you baby One look in your eyes and I gotta say

1342
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:21,560
I know that my feelings don't, but I guess that's the way to let you know I need you

1343
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,560
What else can I do?

1344
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,560
You are my fantasy

1345
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:53,560
You are my fantasy, you are my energy Baby, can't you see that you belong to me?

1346
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,560
I don't know what to say

1347
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:33,560
It's alright, I mean it's alright It's alright, more than that

1348
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:28,160
Yum, daddy, yum, daddy yum, daddy yum, daddy yum, daddy...

No, nobody does

1352
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,840
No, nobody does

1353
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,300

1357
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,000
outta my head

1358
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,580
Bye bye, baby

1359
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,120
Bitch

1360
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,480
Get a new song

1361
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,520
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

1362
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,080
That's right

1363
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,360
a new damn song lady anyway you are listening to orange lounge radio the

1364
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,840
very first show about 836 we're taking the show two hours by the way we're

1365
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,560
gonna go to nine o'clock with this we think if the show is successful in the

1366
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:08,120
future we'll try three hours but actually this is kind of it's kind of

1367
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:12,000
an interesting situation because my co-host Jamie the lovely Jamie Summers

1368
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,920
is going to be gone for the next two shows hey I'm gonna be in San Diego next

1369
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,040
weekend and then I'm going to Anime Expo where I have enlisted aid to do interviews with

1370
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,680
several of the people there in cosplays and general views and crap.

1371
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,760
And that's one thing we're going to bring you on future episodes of Orange Lounge. We

1372
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,840
want to do interviews. Unfortunately we were going to be taking a trip yesterday over to

1373
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,320
Sunnyvale because we knew a lot of people were going to be convening there and we wanted

1374
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,560
to get some interviews with your favorite Bay Area personalities. But unfortunately

1375
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,520
we weren't able to get out there because we, I had a job to do. I got work.

1376
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,600
So we couldn't make it out there.

1377
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,360
But we're going to try in future weeks to get out there.

1378
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,520
And if you have any event in NorCal that you'd like us to

1379
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,360
come cover, drop us an email, OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all

1380
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,360
one word, OrangeLoungeRadio, at yahoo.com.

1381
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,920
And we'll try and make it.

1382
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,400
Even SoCal events we'll consider, but pretty much

1383
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,640
anything further away than that.

1384
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,720
We don't really have a travel budget to accommodate yet.

1385
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,200
But if you want to give us money, we'll definitely think

1386
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:09,640
about it.

1387
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,840
Money is good.

1388
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,040
Money is always wonderful.

1389
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,400
Money facilitates going places and doing things.

1390
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,400
Alright.

1391
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,400
We do have some new subject matter.

1392
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:23,400
Okay, the last song we played just before coming out of that break

1393
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:27,400
was LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix with Overblast,

1394
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:33,400
which is something brand new in the new USA DDR Max that's going to be released.

1395
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:36,400
You remember the release date on that, Jamie?

1396
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,400
I think they said they're going to do it in October.

1397
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,400
November.

1398
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,400
I think they said they're going to do it in October.

1399
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,360
Remember, this is the big, I don't know about you guys, I kind of had a hunch that this

1400
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,920
is what was going to happen at E3, is that they were kind of keeping it a secret, that

1401
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,800
there was going to be a new DDR release in the USA, and it turned out to be that they

1402
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,520
are going to release Max in the USA, except it's not just the same song list, it's going

1403
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:05,080
to be some old songs, like Brilliant To You, Orchestral Groove is in it, and AM3P I believe

1404
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,360
is returning as well.

1405
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,240
One of my friends who is not into Bimani, he was kind enough to videotape some of the

1406
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,880
the game for me while he was at E3.

1407
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,920
The songs that I saw being played, I remember definitely that one of them was Insertion.

1408
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,920
Insertion, very cool.

1409
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,920
He said that it looked very clean, he was very impressed with it.

1410
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:29,640
He got to hear a little bit of some talk about it, and on the tape it sounded like everybody's

1411
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,460
favorite Konami rep, Jason Enos, in the background, giving some information.

1412
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:38,040
If I can find the tape, I'll definitely make sure that I have the segment encoded so that

1413
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,880
everybody can see it, or try to do something like that for everyone.

1414
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,040
that's something we can put up on our website that would be pretty cool but it's kind of old stuff

1415
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:51,360
and there's going to be new stuff and something that is going to be new is 20 new tracks to the

1416
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:55,760
usa something has not been on any japanese release that's one of those songs right there we just

1417
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:00,560
played for you over blast from beatmania fifth mix it's going to be a song in ddr max with steps and

1418
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,560
all that fun stuff and we've been promised that we're going to have we're going to have some

1419
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,520
license songs

1420
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,760
in the new in the new DDR

1421
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,240
let's hope so

1422
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,640
and hopefully no more crappy remixes of AM3P

1423
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:19,080
Hey, I like the remix of AM3P. You do? Well, the one in Max 2 is okay, but...

1424
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:26,080
I like all of the remixes of AM3P. I don't like the remix of Superstar, but that's me.

1425
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,600
But anyways, uh... Overblast. That song...

1426
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,600
I could think that you'd pick some better ones.

1427
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,600
My opinion on this is that that song sucks ass.

1428
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,600
And I wish that they had picked a better song.

1429
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,600
I mean, out of all the BeatMania songs in the world, why the hell do you pick that song?

1430
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Seriously, that song sucks ass.

1431
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,600
Pick, like, The Fall.

1432
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,600
I mean, pick, uh, N.O.F.I.A.

1433
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,600
I mean, there's a bunch of songs.

1434
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,600
Oh, hell, why not 3-2-1 Stars or something like that?

1435
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,600
Just not that song.

1436
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:06,600
But hey, there's still 19 other songs that can be on there, so I still have my hopes up for this, so hopefully you'll be pleased.

1437
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,600
which pretty much eliminates all the top 40 songs.

1438
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,600
And there was much rejoicing, yay!

1439
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,600
And no remixes of Let Them Move.

1440
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,600
God, no.

1441
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,600
It actually has been promised on one of those message boards.

1442
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:45,600
It was promised that there's no Let Them Move in any way, shape, or form.

1443
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,600
Finally, Konami comes to a good decision.

1444
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,600
Hooray for them.

1445
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,600
So we'll keep bringing you the news on Max USA as we hear it

1446
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,600
because it's going to be a big freaking deal, at least for us.

1447
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,600
Because they all say that DDR is dying in Japan.

1448
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,240
I don't know if there's any truth to that. We're not in Japan so we don't really know if it's dying or not

1449
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:08,320
But that's what people are saying. So we'll see maybe it's dying there, but it's gonna be big here

1450
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,660
So maybe they'll start focusing their efforts on what's starting to become a fad here

1451
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,240
I would actually like you know in the whole respect that we're getting this

1452
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:20,720
Max USA I would like to actually I'm probably not listening

1453
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,260
But I would still like to give a big kudos to Jason Enos of Konami of America

1454
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:28,260
for all of the hard work that's been put into us getting these games.

1455
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:32,260
And anybody that happened to contribute, I know he's

1456
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:36,260
kind of the contact person, he's the one that lurks on all the DDR boards and stuff

1457
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:40,260
letting us know what's going on, but anybody that happens to be involved with that whole process deserves to thank you.

1458
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,260
Whoever woke up over there and said, let's bring DDR to the US

1459
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:48,260
and let's bring them something new, not just recycled crap that they've already imported

1460
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:52,260
because you know Konami's got to know about all these import machines. That's one thing that's completely

1461
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:57,220
boggled me is you've got all these max 2 machines popping up everywhere it's the

1462
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,660
new thing and which is great because max 2 is the best mix they've done in a long

1463
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:06,540
long time I would say most people wouldn't argue with me there but yet

1464
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:10,300
Konami doesn't seem to be they have that you know this message is illegal for use

1465
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,060
outside of Japan message that comes on the screen but yet they're not really

1466
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:17,420
doing anything about it all these max 2 machines are still sitting there so well

1467
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:26,420
We're not seeing a new release, at least that I've heard of, or that, you know, as far as an arcade release, I haven't seen any new releases come through.

1468
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:37,420
I'm not sure exactly the reasoning behind that, but, you know, if they're not minding us getting those imports or they're not actively trying to stop it, let's not bring that up and not, you know...

1469
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:41,140
It's very interesting to see that we're actually getting a brand new, you know, actually it

1470
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:45,300
doesn't look like something recycled as Rob was putting it. And actually it's looking

1471
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:49,660
like they're putting time in it. I mean, adding features like, you know, the 0.5 speed and

1472
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,900
other things like that, it looks pretty good.

1473
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,500
Although, 0.5 is kind of a weak feature. It's not really.

1474
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Yeah.

1475
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:00,580
How many people are going to, outside of Max 300, which is, in my mind, it's kind of a

1476
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:06,780
crutch if you're going to use 0.5 speed to beat max 300.

1477
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,420
What is the use of 0.5?

1478
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:08,820
I don't know.

1479
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:10,660
Is it just to make things challenging, you think?

1480
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:12,940
I think it's to make things more challenging.

1481
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:15,260
One of the other things that I was looking at is hopefully

1482
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,900
this won't be as buggy as Conomex was.

1483
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:21,360
I mean, you have problems with the fact that you can't take

1484
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,740
the edits off of there, put them on Japanese machines

1485
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:27,260
because they do have region coding inside actual edits

1486
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:30,060
also, which kind of sucked ass.

1487
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,500
Hopefully, they'll fix that this time around.

1488
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:35,500
Also, it's very interesting that in Europe, they're

1489
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:39,140
getting Euromaxx, which is the brand new Euromixx there,

1490
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,100
which is awesome.

1491
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,300
I wish we could get some of their songs over here.

1492
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:42,820
I wish.

1493
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:44,460
Yeah, that would be neat.

1494
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,200
Now, maybe this is Konami's little trick

1495
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,900
is that they're going to actually take those songs they

1496
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,820
put in Euromixx and give them to us.

1497
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,180
Well, what's interesting, though,

1498
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,540
is Euromaxx, they're also getting a machine for that.

1499
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:58,140
So maybe we can maybe be looking forward to DDR USA Maxx also.

1500
01:43:58,140 --> 01:43:58,980
That would be nice.

1501
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:07,980
Very nice. Something that's being suggested in the chat room, a use for 0.5. Imagine my summer love maniac on 0.5 flat.

1502
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,980
That sounds like fun.

1503
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:14,980
Yeah, so, stealth. That kind of eliminates, that eliminates, oh okay.

1504
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:16,980
It's effectively stealth though.

1505
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:22,980
It's effectively stealth. We're overhearing from the back of the room. Interesting suggestion there.

1506
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:29,180
So, I don't know when we're going to hear more news on MacsUSA, but we'll give that

1507
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:32,780
to you as soon as we hear any more information on that. One thing we have been hearing little

1508
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:37,900
bits and pieces about, it's kind of a surprise to most people, was DDR PC. We're not talking

1509
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:40,740
about the politically correct version of DDR where the heroin needle is removed. We're

1510
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:44,300
talking about DDR for the personal computer on IBM. Have you heard about this?

1511
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:49,060
Yes, I have. It's actually exclusive to Fry's and Outpost.com. You can go buy it there.

1512
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:54,860
it's basically like 4th Mix on a PC. You've got 40 characters you can choose from, they're

1513
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:59,180
gonna have more that you can actually download off their website at some point or another.

1514
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:03,060
Right now it's been kinda iffy, they've been having it, you know, available, then coming

1515
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:06,180
soon, available, coming soon, so I think they're having a little bit of trouble getting the

1516
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:10,380
actual product out there, they're falling short on that. As far as the song list goes,

1517
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:15,180
you only have a few more that actually aren't available in any of the US versions, but pretty

1518
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,260
Pretty much it's just a rehash of 4th Mix all over again.

1519
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:24,260
Actually, I was promised to be able to try this out pretty soon so I'll be able to maybe

1520
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:25,420
give a review on that.

1521
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,940
That'll be nice next week maybe.

1522
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:31,380
But one of the features that was pretty interesting with this one was the fact that they're adding

1523
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:35,620
internet ranking just like 4th Mix and all the other Japanese releases had.

1524
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:36,940
So this is pretty good.

1525
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:40,420
I don't know how well it's working out though because you have people playing on keyboards

1526
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:42,420
and you have people playing on pads.

1527
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:48,080
So, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of, you know, inflating of people's actual ability

1528
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,860
on there. But it looks pretty good if you haven't had any home versions.

1529
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:55,740
I wonder if there's some kind of switch that would be able to show, hey, this person played

1530
01:45:55,740 --> 01:46:00,260
on the pad or this person played on the keyboard. But even then, any hacker could probably wire

1531
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:04,380
a switch that would look like a pad. Well, actually, no, they do have such a thing

1532
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:08,260
in Dance with Intensity. They have it where it actually detects whether it's keyboard

1533
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:13,580
were playing with a controller, but now still.

1534
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:14,580
Probably.

1535
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:18,060
If they just did a port of the PlayStation version, they probably didn't bother to go

1536
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:19,460
that far with it.

1537
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:25,100
But one thing, I remember before the break, Dave was out here talking about Fries, and

1538
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,220
I know a lot of people on the west coast probably haven't seen this because they don't have

1539
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,980
Fries electronics outside of California too much.

1540
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,620
They've got this really interesting setup for DDR.

1541
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:35,940
Have any of you guys been over to Fries and seen their DDR setup?

1542
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:40,000
They've got the two Bads on the ground, and Fries is on a concrete floor, at least the

1543
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,160
one we go to here in Sacramento, has a concrete floor on it, so it makes it pretty good to

1544
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,680
dance on, so it kind of feels like the arcade pad.

1545
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:50,320
And then they've got like a big screen TV with DDR economics going on it, and every

1546
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,800
time I've gone into Fries, I don't play DDR at Fries, it's just kind of weird, I don't

1547
01:46:54,800 --> 01:47:00,660
want to be stared at by all those weird people, but I constantly see little kids in there

1548
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:05,320
playing on the thing, and I, those things, the Pads and games sell, it seems like I always

1549
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:09,380
seem to look over and there's one set of parents, at least one set of parents, looking at the

1550
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,460
games, thinking about buying them. So, Fry's has kind of been pushing it.

1551
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:15,420
The people really, really, really want to go to GameStop.

1552
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:20,380
Now, let's see. And I'd like to respond to Joe Mama in the chat room about editing images

1553
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:25,360
and posting them. Actually, they have passwords. And basically, it's just a long string of

1554
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:30,180
letters and numbers that they give you when you, you know, finish your songs to post up

1555
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:33,880
for the internet rankings. It doesn't have anything to do with screen captures or anything

1556
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,680
like that. So there's really no way to cheat as far as Photoshopping goes. But I mean,

1557
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:42,600
I'm sure there's ways you could probably find to, you know, crack the passwords and all

1558
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,600
that kind of thing.

1559
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,920
Just like, it sounds like it was going to be just like the ranking for 4th Mix and 5th

1560
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,640
Mix and Max 2, everything you had on it where you had the long passwords. So it's pretty

1561
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:56,100
much a lifted system from that. I wonder if there's, if it matches any other game though.

1562
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:00,160
Like if you were to play a song on another mix, it gives you the same code that PC would

1563
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,160
give you.

1564
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:06,080
um... someone i believe we should make it apart to actually post somewhere

1565
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:11,000
the actual there is internet ranking in max to unlock people don't know about it

1566
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,120
if you play at three songs certain songs in a row

1567
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:17,660
the luxury of password that they can post on the internet ranking site not

1568
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:21,840
many people know that that's actually out there

1569
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,160
perhaps i need to make this uh... future contest or something you know

1570
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,560
uh... i don't know about that in the idea

1571
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:34,240
captured japanese ur dominate japanese and people from a the barrier probably

1572
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,520
dominating that uh... internet ranking let's there but

1573
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,600
we could give it a try

1574
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,880
there's also the only making and that there is uh...

1575
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:45,960
somewhere and i think while those papers that page for the only ranking

1576
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,500
yeah they'd be date

1577
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,480
with the effort

1578
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,940
to translate the internet ranking page in english so big shout out to them for

1579
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:55,240
doing that that's a good favor to the whole community there

1580
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:00,360
And speaking of the community, I'd like to make a mention that if ever, you know, whenever

1581
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,440
we're not hosting our show live, you can also check out a lot of the community action for

1582
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:14,280
the SACBEMANI forums, located at www.sacbemani.com, that's S-A-C-B-E-M-A-N-I dot com.

1583
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:17,520
But we're definitely not going to be restricting the show to just the Sacramento community,

1584
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,760
we want to get everybody involved, and I'm looking in the future at future shows to get

1585
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,480
more guests involved in the show, hopefully some people will be able to come down from

1586
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,120
the Bay Area and be in the show. And as I said, if we can't bring them to us, we're

1587
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,560
going to go out to them. We're going to go out and tape at some tournaments and stuff

1588
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,720
like that. So you might see us around. So come say hi and you can be on our show that

1589
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:37,960
way. I'm going to take a really quick break here and then we're going to come back and

1590
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,680
wrap things up. So I'm going to do a set of a couple 2DX songs and then we'll come right

1591
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:48,680
back. We'll start it off with Rizlam here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1592
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,680
Why?

1593
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,680
Why?

1594
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,680
Why?

1595
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,680
Why?

1596
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:47,680
Why?

1597
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:22,680
Where's my fan when I need it? I wanted to do the TranDance.

1598
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,680
The TranDance?

1599
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,680
The StarMine TranDance.

1600
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:27,680
That's actually the way I freestyle in 2DX.

1601
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:32,680
There's a little break in StarMine and I'll do a little spinny arm thing anyway.

1602
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,680
Let me hear about that.

1603
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,680
Anyway, that was Ryu with StarMine before that.

1604
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:38,680
Rick with Rizllm from 2DX.

1605
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,680
Rizllm gets you.

1606
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,680
And right now, they've been playing 2DX all night here in the broadcast room.

1607
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,680
They're playing, what is this, Love Will?

1608
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:45,680
That's a great 2DX song.

1609
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:46,680
They will play that next week.

1610
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:51,260
next week. That's old school 2DX. Old school 2DX. We're getting ready to wrap up the show

1611
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,960
here, our first show. I'd like to thank everybody here for listening tonight. Thank you so much

1612
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,160
for listening to our first show. You're listening to a little piece of Bomani history, I'd like

1613
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,260
to thank. I'd like to thank me. I don't want to quit after the first week, so that's a

1614
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,920
good sign that there's a little bit of life left here in the show. I was kind of worried

1615
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:09,700
that, you know, this show would scare me off so bad I'd want to quit. But no, I think we're

1616
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:14,380
going to do this for quite a while, and look for us coming to an arcade near you soon.

1617
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:19,660
One thing we do need to talk about though, we kind of touched on this briefly right before,

1618
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:22,980
right when we came back from the last segment, but Jamie you're going to be gone for a couple

1619
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:23,980
weeks now.

1620
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:27,180
You're the co-host of the show yet you're already abandoning us, but with good reason.

1621
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:31,380
I go to AX every year and I'm actually heading down a week early to go to San Diego to see

1622
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:37,460
some friends and to hunt down our little youth coalition friend with a chainsaw.

1623
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:42,620
I mean, with a recorder so I can maybe get an interview if the door's not slammed in

1624
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:43,620
my face.

1625
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:44,620
Right.

1626
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:49,380
But really, I'm going to be at Anime Expo, I'm going to have recorders with me.

1627
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:53,420
So all of you people who are going to be there, watch out for the girl with the wings.

1628
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,420
Yes, I will be in costume.

1629
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:57,060
I've seen Cosplay, it's great.

1630
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:59,060
Jamie's Cosplay costume is something else for this.

1631
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:04,140
I will be either in costume as Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary, or Biken from Guilty

1632
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,980
Gear X, or Leona from King of Fighters.

1633
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:12,860
So watch out for the short girl in the costume with the big black wings and the face paint.

1634
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,460
Our website was finished today and your picture's on it so they can find it there.

1635
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,460
Yes.

1636
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,460
Exactly.

1637
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:23,940
But the issue is, we're still doing the show every week, so we're going to have an open

1638
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:24,940
seat.

1639
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:27,420
So, what do you think I should do about this predicament we're in?

1640
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:29,100
Should I have them all fight over it?

1641
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,500
Should I make them all play 2DX to see who wins?

1642
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:34,340
You could do like the clown car thing and pile them all in.

1643
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:35,340
What?

1644
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:36,740
You could do the clown car thing and pile them all in.

1645
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:40,100
i think this is also the biggest seat is really cushy and i think that we should

1646
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:42,020
just take caution tape around it

1647
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:44,660
and people have to caution job to get it

1648
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:48,660
yeah hurt hurt hurt hurt

1649
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:51,460
or there we go we could do a limitation

1650
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,300
we get tricky about all we do

1651
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:56,620
bahmani survivor

1652
01:55:56,620 --> 01:56:00,100
that this scene will be filled by a random individual

1653
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:05,420
but it will be temporarily filled because i don't let up my spidey hahaha

1654
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:09,260
maybe we'll do the money pop idol has a sound

1655
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,060
your offer would be quiet

1656
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:14,180
you don't know what you're talking about

1657
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:18,900
why you're not coming to hollywood you little bitch you all the weakest link

1658
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,900
on the line that's pretty much across between the weakest link in star search

1659
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,340
and this is why i don't like to see if you know where you know we should do

1660
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:28,900
karaoke to see you know i think on i've been to karaoke

1661
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:32,620
i think maybe what we'll do is we'll just uh... come back next week and we'll

1662
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:37,060
We'll kind of surprise everybody with who we're gonna have. Maybe we'll talk about it during the week.

1663
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:43,060
I don't know, unless you have any... We will have a lovely surprise waiting for the crowd next week.

1664
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:46,740
Are you sure? No karaoke?

1665
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:49,340
And no karaoke? Maybe we'll do karaoke.

1666
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:53,440
Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you.

1667
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,900
Irene lost. Anyway. Oh, no I didn't.

1668
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:00,740
Or we could just settle this the good old D&D way. Where's my dice?

1669
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:06,500
uh... nobody chat but i know all of you know indeed he means to you

1670
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,460
because all about the doors i mean

1671
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:11,900
well i think i started and i think it's just about that

1672
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:16,080
how we take a number of the one in six everyone takes a number don't say it on

1673
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:16,880
the air

1674
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:19,400
and they will have someone that in our chat room

1675
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,760
at random number three one six

1676
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,000
and i'll be your house

1677
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,480
to be overnight

1678
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,520
do that i need to straight over all of you all

1679
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:36,520
six different numbers

1680
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:41,820
and as we have a moment of silence to decide since the microphone can't pick

1681
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,880
up the people in the background

1682
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:48,320
i think that we will have a random guest next week and we will surprise our

1683
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:52,600
beautiful lovely listeners who we all love very much and they're trying not to

1684
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,920
board a desk and if worse comes to worse we'll just pass the headset around

1685
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,920
we'll let everybody sit in the chair for a segment does that sound like a fair option?

1686
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,600
Now you're pimping out my chair.

1687
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,040
Yeah, we'll pimp out the chair.

1688
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:05,240
So the new co-host for next week will be the Bahmani pimp.

1689
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:05,960
How's that sound?

1690
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:06,880
They'll be the whore.

1691
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,800
We've got to be the pimp to pimp out the chair.

1692
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,600
OK, so they'll be the Bahmani whores.

1693
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:13,120
That's true.

1694
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:14,600
You can get ejected out of the chair.

1695
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:14,840
You can get ejected out of the chair.

1696
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,760
Just get something stupid, bam, and you're out of the chair.

1697
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:17,240
And then we need to bring the gong.

1698
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,200
I bring the button with a spring.

1699
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,080
And if you piss me off, I'll just do it.

1700
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,480
It'll be like Russian roulette.

1701
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,480
It'd be like.

1702
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,040
They'll fall through the floor.

1703
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,520
Oh, that's Russian roulette.

1704
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,520
Russian Roulette.

1705
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,320
It would be like that MTV show, Remote Control.

1706
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,320
It'd be like Remote Control.

1707
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:38,620
Now, see, there is a sign of being old when you remember when Remote Control was new.

1708
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:43,500
That means you're old if you remember Remote Control.

1709
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,500
And you know what's funny enough?

1710
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,500
A winner is Irene.

1711
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,560
What was the song they all sang when the person went through the wall?

1712
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:53,400
Na na na na, na na na na, hey Harry.

1713
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:56,400
Party!

1714
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,780
Anyway, I think we're going to bring this show to a close now.

1715
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:01,200
Thank you everybody for listening.

1716
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,600
Please join us next week again at 7 o'clock.

1717
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:06,260
We're going to rebroadcast this show sometime through the week.

1718
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:08,100
I just haven't figured out a good time yet.

1719
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:10,900
So if there's a part you missed, you can hear it later.

1720

But do send us an email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1721

And let us know what songs you want to hear through the week.

1723
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,380
And yeah, all your suggestions and stuff.

1724
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:26,880
All your suggestions are below the list.

1725
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,400
Exactly.

1726
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,600
For great justice.

1727
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,120
All right.

1728
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,080
So we're going to end the show now.

1729
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,760
Thank you to everybody for listening.

1730
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,480
And we will see you next week on the Orange Lounge.

1731
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:39,000
Any final thoughts, Jamie?

1732
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,600
Be excellent to each other.

1733
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:41,720
Party on, dude.

1734
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:49,680
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
