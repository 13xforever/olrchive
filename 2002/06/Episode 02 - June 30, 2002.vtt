00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Oh, you're being onto us, you mess!

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
You want to a cute happy moment?

00:54.000 --> 00:54.500
Yeah.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.000
I'm not sad that I haven't had a chance to put you in the match.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
It's about love.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Let's go with the high.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's go high to the high.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Come on, darling.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You turn up in the way.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
You there.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, okay.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm working on it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Run.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm about to run, baby.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Really?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Run?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
You do the best.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
You do the best.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Run.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
It's your host Jamie Summers AKA Dark Sakura.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
But, off this weekend, Jamie has decided to skip town a bit early to head off to the big Anime Expo convention in Southern California.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
But we have a substitute teacher for you tonight.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Hello to the lovely Irene.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Thank you very much.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Or you can simply call her the right person.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
This is episode number 2 for June 30th of 2002.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
We are joined in studio once again by a whole bunch of senior personalities.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.200
Say hello everybody.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.200
Hello!

02:22.200 --> 02:26.000
We'll be talking to some of them more a bit later, but first a very quick break.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.500
Any other opening thoughts for you?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.200
Oh great, last Christmas.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.500
Why don't you look at some Christmas presents?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
Oh, um, okay.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.500
Open the thing you can't come up to the show.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
It's in your boyfriend.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
Oh, um, okay.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.000
I want to try the new triple taco one.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Give me a hug.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
That is a thing so much.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.500
Good morning.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.500
Oh, fun money. I still don't have money. Do you think coffee's worth it, Mr. James?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
I don't think so.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
Okay, 50 things on the way. Yeah.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.500
Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.500
We'll be talking about all sorts of fun stuff this week.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.500
Another two hours to be killed before mommy's back at the movies.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
Oh

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
I

06:59.500 --> 07:27.500
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
We love you! We love you!

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
Wooooo! Noooooo!

07:31.500 --> 07:33.500
We love you! We love you!

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
Noooooo!

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
We love you! We love you!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
Noooooo!

07:41.500 --> 07:46.500
Extreme Bopati Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.500
That is us. Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the second broadcast.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
Oh yes! Look it up over there on the other computer.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
Are you being pirates?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
Arrgh!

07:56.500 --> 07:58.500
And she'll throw me a thunder.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
What is? What? Yes.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Did you hear about that new pirate movie?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
No I didn't.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
It's rated Arrgh!

08:06.500 --> 08:10.500
Oh, I can always count on you for a funny joke.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.500
I'm so glad Jamie chose you this time. Let's see it for the sake.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
Jamie is supposedly joining us in the chat room right now, but

08:18.500 --> 08:25.000
now, but she's under the name Bright Sakura, so I have to admit I'm a little skeptical, so I just have to

08:25.000 --> 08:33.500
I have to quiz questions to make sure it's really who it is. So we'll see if she's able to frankly identify herself.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
She's so pretty.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Bright Sakura.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.500
Well I imagine if I were junior right now, I'd be in a pretty puppy mood too.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.500
Oh, I'd be like, pretty. You know that is so awesome.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.000
You know that she's been the past four days working on her costumes.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Probably nonstop.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.640
I've barely heard from her in the past week.

08:50.640 --> 08:55.640
She's spent so much time and effort working on the costume with all the friends of hers, she's been helping her out.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.760
This is awesome.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.260
Yeah.

08:57.260 --> 08:58.760
And who is she going to love again?

08:58.760 --> 09:05.760
Um, um, don't go down the street fire and then there's some, some angel.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Angel friends you might need.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.760
Yeah, angel friends you might need too.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.760
And it's wearing all black.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.760
And then there's a hot air person.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.260
Yes, was it that hot?

09:15.260 --> 09:16.260
Was there a hot air person?

09:16.260 --> 09:17.260
I don't know.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.060
This is how much we know about anime here, so...

09:20.060 --> 09:22.260
Oh, Jamie's gonna show us some chipmunks.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.260
Oh my gosh!

09:25.260 --> 09:26.260
Okay.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.260
So anyway...

09:30.260 --> 09:31.260
Well I thought, uh...

09:31.260 --> 09:34.260
Well that's what you're talking about, this whole, uh, Solo 2000 thing.

09:34.260 --> 09:39.260
This is about the only thing in the bohani news that's pretty big right now, since there's no new games coming out, really.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.260
Uh, Solo 2000...

09:41.260 --> 09:48.260
The evil, evil machine that it is, getting pulled from bowling alleys and things across the nation, that's just one so far.

09:48.260 --> 09:57.260
Um, but it's starting to kind of cause this fear and panic amongst other people, like oh my gosh, are they going to pull our solo machine in a place that we're happy USA makes, so what's going to happen?

09:57.260 --> 10:08.260
To make things worse this week, uh, Fox News in San Diego, Channel 6, aired a special little report, and I thought we'd air it for you here on the show.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.980
And that's how we can all respond to it live on air.

10:10.980 --> 10:16.020
If you ever want me to pause this you can kind of just let me know, but let's take a look at this little, little news story.

10:16.020 --> 10:21.340
This is coming to us by the way from Bomaniac.com and then I just recently stole it from them.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.340
But basically I'm providing it for the internet, so here we go.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.340
I enjoy stick for a button.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.340
And then it uses your feet.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.340
His aim is called BXBS revolution.

10:29.340 --> 10:31.340
It's popular among kids and teens.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.340
And now some are saying they're shocked at what they're actually seeing.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.340
Half the kids need to put a tonic. Half the kids need an hour or more of talent.

10:37.340 --> 11:06.980
We're running back the

11:06.980 --> 11:08.980
to bye bye baby balloon.

11:08.980 --> 11:10.980
Oh my gosh.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.980
Hey, hey, this looks easy.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.980
And more importantly, this looks like dancing hot.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.980
When you're out there and you have the music going on.

11:18.980 --> 11:22.980
When I see this woman up there talking on the screen right now I'm not thinking about fun.

11:22.980 --> 11:23.980
I don't...

11:23.980 --> 11:24.980
Who is this lady?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.980
Her name is Pamela Cameron and she's a mom.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.980
Just a mom.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
Just a mom.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.980
She's probably the only white lady in San Diego.

11:32.980 --> 11:34.980
I used to live there. I would know.

11:34.980 --> 11:40.980
I've been waiting for an hour and I didn't know that there was a corn line so my kids go up and start looking at me.

11:40.980 --> 11:45.980
There's things we're moving on and the most thing for six is meat.

11:45.980 --> 11:46.980
Oh!

11:46.980 --> 11:47.980
Yes, yes evolution of meat.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.980
I thought it was pretty small myself.

11:49.980 --> 11:50.980
It's the bee's meat.

11:50.980 --> 11:51.980
Hahaha!

11:51.980 --> 11:52.980
Hahaha!

11:52.980 --> 11:53.980
Hahaha!

11:53.980 --> 11:54.980
Hahaha!

11:54.980 --> 11:56.980
CDR's meat.

11:56.980 --> 12:02.980
Today I'm going to ask you a question but I was really quite aligned because you're there and I...

12:02.980 --> 12:03.980
Ahh...

12:03.980 --> 12:07.980
I was really quite alarmed. It was a shark!

12:07.980 --> 12:10.980
Oh, it's a nurse and pill.

12:12.980 --> 12:17.980
Pills all around and needles and holes at my back.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.980
Even if you just lay them on your chest, they'll be safe.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.980
But if I had to, I would say, hang on.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.980
Oh, do you see what I see?

12:25.980 --> 12:27.980
Oh, I see.

12:27.980 --> 12:28.980
Oh.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.980
What do you see?

12:30.980 --> 12:33.980
That's why a local youth group said that.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.980
What the fuck? Why did you even have to point that out to me?

12:36.980 --> 12:41.980
Dogs are actually the nurse administering like children and meals and stuff.

12:41.980 --> 12:43.980
You know like that's the whole theme.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.980
It's not like they're the opening thing bringing drug dealers in the background.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.980
Oh my god, it's a drug dealing nurse.

12:48.980 --> 12:49.980
I know.

12:49.980 --> 12:50.980
Ah, shit.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.980
How about any of them?

12:52.980 --> 12:55.980
They're the ones who give me the name of the one.

12:55.980 --> 12:56.980
Is that the chick?

12:56.980 --> 13:05.980
I know this chick's name is Jamie Bernstein, who is a member of the advocacy coalition, however, it's not the same person that's catching all of that.

13:05.980 --> 13:06.980
Forget her name.

13:06.980 --> 13:08.980
So come on, baby, yeah!

13:08.980 --> 13:09.980
Ha ha ha!

13:09.980 --> 13:11.980
She's getting too much better than her!

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
Ha ha ha!

13:12.980 --> 13:13.980
Ah, damn it.

13:13.980 --> 13:14.980
Okay, anyway, let's see.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.980
Oh, right on.

13:15.980 --> 13:19.980
Um, um, if you come from any movement, there are very, very, um,

13:19.980 --> 13:23.260
So, the team will believe that these are the machines that are on the show.

13:23.260 --> 13:27.660
And it's way, way better than it ever comes with a machine that can have these machines.

13:27.660 --> 13:31.980
Okay, however, the machine she's playing on is still a six-manner machine, so...

13:31.980 --> 13:33.260
You know what's funny?

13:33.260 --> 13:38.780
They show a picture of Nast, and then they have, like, all the needles and stuff,

13:38.780 --> 13:41.100
but then they replace it with a skull and a machine.

13:41.100 --> 13:45.820
Like, they show the picture of Nast at the top, and at the beginning when Nast is playing it,

13:45.820 --> 13:49.340
they're showing, like, uh, somewhere over the rainbow and bye-bye to the balloon.

13:49.340 --> 13:54.340
But then when they show the needles, they saw on the, uh, solo machine.

13:54.340 --> 13:58.340
And then they go back to the mat, see how they're replacing it, and they show the solo machine.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.340
That's what we replace through it, and it doesn't really make sense.

14:01.340 --> 14:06.340
But, these images are still on some local dance machine!

14:06.340 --> 14:09.340
Well, you know, how are you going to take them off of the machine?

14:09.340 --> 14:11.340
Of course they're still going to be on one.

14:11.340 --> 14:13.340
Are they going out of the hammer-on?

14:13.340 --> 14:15.340
I want to know if that was how someone noticed this, Toby.

14:15.340 --> 14:18.340
This guy doesn't look like he ever notices a line.

14:18.340 --> 14:24.340
I believe this is the owner of the bowling alley that's around there.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.340
But it's just so tiny.

14:26.340 --> 14:30.340
But the event is a few arms, some local bands, and a shoe.

14:30.340 --> 14:33.340
I never know if that is where someone lives with their baby.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.340
I never know this yet until someone mentioned it to me.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.340
Wait, what? One of those animals?

14:39.340 --> 14:45.340
I don't know that movie, but it seems like the guy who just sits there in the back of the bowling alley

14:45.340 --> 14:47.340
faces out for a little while during this shit.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.340
You're probably the janitor!

14:49.340 --> 14:51.340
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

14:51.340 --> 14:53.340
Look! Look! Look!

14:53.340 --> 14:55.340
We plan to make some changes.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.340
Hey, listen. We've got so many things out there

14:57.340 --> 14:59.340
that we really need to change

14:59.340 --> 15:01.340
our lives and our lives actually.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.340
The fun is to see that.

15:03.340 --> 15:05.340
See? There's too many things

15:05.340 --> 15:07.340
out there to change.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.340
So, let's start with those

15:09.340 --> 15:11.340
evil dancing machines.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.340
In images

15:13.340 --> 15:17.340
Now some pieces of space should have never been there in the first place.

15:21.340 --> 15:27.340
Now these bands were sent as soon as you might know this, but look what I told you, it's nine billion fifty percent of the planet.

15:27.340 --> 15:33.340
I won't point out most of the bands, bands, revolutions, and scenes do not contain images of drugs or diseases.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.340
I did find that all in that.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.340
So what do you guys think of that beautiful little report?

15:39.340 --> 15:42.340
We are making it back into the news media again.

15:42.340 --> 15:47.340
That's pretty cool, because you know, anything that sets a controversy is obviously going to become hugely positive.

15:47.340 --> 15:51.340
And, um, the fact is that they had that contradiction themselves.

15:51.340 --> 15:57.340
They said there's already been, yeah, there's already been change, you know?

15:57.340 --> 15:59.340
Or some years ago, you know?

15:59.340 --> 16:03.340
Hold on, we have to stop the show because they want to play with this flincy that's sitting on the desk here.

16:03.340 --> 16:04.340
So, hold on a minute.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.340
Very good.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.340
Enjoy.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.340
Alright, I'm sorry.

16:07.340 --> 16:08.340
I know a lot.

16:08.340 --> 16:19.340
And they should put a warning on the Earth that says if you play this, you're going to, you know, evoke the dark lord Satan and he's going to come and eat your children.

16:19.340 --> 16:31.340
I mean, no! Seriously, I think there are more, you know, people out there doing worse things than hunting the Earth, which is good for your health and there's so many benefits to them.

16:31.340 --> 16:35.340
And I'm not going to, obviously, listen to everyone else that's playing.

16:35.340 --> 16:42.540
That's actually the first time really I've seen those images that they've been referring about on the, on the article and all that stuff

16:42.540 --> 16:52.140
like these evil images of the nurse riding on a syringe and stuff because I've only voice told her 2,000 one time and I didn't play with them.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.540
You know, why don't you manage what your children are doing?

16:56.140 --> 17:00.540
You know, if you don't like them, why don't you, don't let them play, but don't clap and say hello.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.540
Why would you leave your kids with some guy in a bow and arrow who look like that?

17:03.540 --> 17:04.040
Oh no!

17:04.040 --> 17:05.540
It's just sitting in the back.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.040
Not, not, not holding on.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.540
Yeah, and you didn't do worse things than the frickin' new guys!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.040
Oh my god!

17:11.040 --> 17:15.540
Geez, they don't, they don't, they don't like to think, they just like to feel.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.540
You think we're going to be seeing a lot more of these kind of new stories, Seth, are we?

17:18.540 --> 17:19.540
I don't know.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.040
I don't know.

17:20.040 --> 17:20.540
I don't know.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.040
I don't know.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.540
It's amazing.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.540
Yeah.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.540
There.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.540
I'm actually, I don't know, guys.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.540
I don't know.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.540
I don't know.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.540
I don't know.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.040
I don't know.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
Anyway.

17:33.040 --> 17:42.040
Um, yeah, so, well all those pills look exactly like the pills from Dr. Mario, you're absolutely right, at a point.

17:42.040 --> 17:47.040
I don't remember that up, counting as one of them, of course I was kind of younger then, maybe there was something going on,

17:47.040 --> 17:55.040
but between them, Dr. Mario wasn't just provocatively, you know, in a cute little bikini outfit, you know, and straddling a syringe, you know.

17:55.040 --> 17:59.040
Do you think that Dr. Mario has been like Dr. Princess Peach, but with a different issue?

17:59.040 --> 18:03.040
And she would like, you know, straddling the little viruses and things like that.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
Maybe, who knows?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
Sorry, what?

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
It was so hard.

18:07.040 --> 18:11.040
I know, but I think like if one of the viruses were going down on her, you know,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.040
it wouldn't like that.

18:12.040 --> 18:16.040
But, um, if it were talking to mine on a big screen, I'd kill myself.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.040
That's pretty gross.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
But yeah, I don't know.

18:19.040 --> 18:24.040
That's probably just because it's that female thing that you don't see on TV every day or anything.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.040
You know, some girl has...

18:26.040 --> 18:31.040
Well, maybe you are going to see it on TV every day. I just flip it through the news stations and oh!

18:31.040 --> 18:34.040
I mean, I'm just running in general, standing with my eyes, you know?

18:34.040 --> 18:37.040
Open up the newspaper and look at the laundry section, you know?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.040
And then whack off to it, too.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.040
It's called See, All of the Wild, I'm special.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.040
I know!

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
Behind the Playboy mansion.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.040
And MTV!

18:48.040 --> 18:49.040
All of it.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.040
So, in a brilliant sphere.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
I know, guys.

18:53.040 --> 19:03.040
So, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, we got comments you want to give on this, go ahead and join IRC.APEX.ORG

19:03.040 --> 19:13.040
And then the channel is Orange Lounge and hopefully within the next week we will have a little online applet thing that you can just load right in your browser to get on there.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.040
So we'll work on that for the next two weeks. So it's really easy to get in our chatroom.

19:16.040 --> 19:25.040
If you do have any comments on it, go ahead and visit our chat room if you know how to get into MIRC and we'll read some of your stuff on the air if you want.

19:25.040 --> 19:31.040
In fact, I'm being corrected that Jamie's costume for Anime Expo is Baiken and the Mad Hatter.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
Yeah, I wouldn't think that would happen.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
What is it going to happen?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
Yeah, how bad?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Uh-huh.

19:36.040 --> 19:42.040
Also, comedy, it's a nurse. It's giving props to doctors. It's raising medical awareness.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.040
Yeah, you know.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.800
See your doctor. Get your check-ups ready, truly, which I don't do.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.480
So I'm not playing enough solo today.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.480
I haven't been to the doctor in three years.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.980
I've been to the doctor in three years.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.240
Oh, well, she took my crossfit. I'm bad.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
I'm so bad.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.240
Shut up.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.240
Heh heh heh.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.240
Heh heh.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.240
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, and then we'll come back with, uh, many, many FUs of the week.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
Everybody, now that Jamie's gone this week, it seems like everybody has their own FU in the week.

20:10.240 --> 20:14.080
And also, Paul will be giving us his Drama Drama Revolution wrap up.

20:14.080 --> 20:18.040
So, uh, stay tuned. We'll be right back in about three minutes.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.760
There will be the Orange Lounge radio.

23:49.760 --> 23:56.760
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

24:19.760 --> 24:24.760
and

24:24.760 --> 24:29.760
the

24:29.760 --> 24:34.760
the

24:34.760 --> 24:39.760
the

24:39.760 --> 24:44.760
the

25:14.760 --> 25:43.760
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

25:43.760 --> 25:52.760
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live for this June 30th and Brad is back in the house and he has brought Krispy Kreme's with him.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
Thank you Brad!

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
Yay!

25:54.760 --> 25:55.760
What flavors do we have here?

25:55.760 --> 25:56.760
Oh yummy!

25:56.760 --> 25:58.760
I don't want one of those rolls of bacon, I reckon.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.760
That thing's pretty good.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.760
Oh I do have some for a bite.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.760
I should be on a diet.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.760
Although I did take, I did take back what I made this week.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.760
I decided that it was pointless.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
Why didn't I make these delicious?

26:09.760 --> 26:10.760
I didn't mean to.

26:10.760 --> 26:11.760
Too good for me to be doing that.

26:11.760 --> 26:17.760
And you know what I noticed today? I went to Monboli and Barbecued today and I was only able to eat...

26:17.760 --> 26:21.760
I put beef in it because I figured it's awesome back on red meat, let's go overboard with it.

26:21.760 --> 26:27.760
And I was only able to eat like a third of the bowl. Whereas if I usually get like chicken or anything else, I eat the whole damn thing.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.760
Does that happen just like with drones and stuff?

26:30.760 --> 26:36.760
It's probably a protein. You can try to give me this whole spiel video with protein and things like that.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.760
So I don't know, maybe my body's just reacting to it.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.240
It's kind of like putting myself on a diet in a way, if I'm eating well.

26:42.240 --> 26:42.740
Hey!

26:42.740 --> 26:43.940
Yeah, can I help?

26:43.940 --> 26:45.100
Can I help?

26:45.100 --> 26:46.600
Yeah?

26:46.600 --> 26:54.180
Anyway, Jamie Summers is on vacation this week, and actually she's going off to N.A.E.S.M.O.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.140
But she has a little segment she does every week, or at least she did it last week,

26:57.140 --> 27:00.080
and she says she's going to be doing it every week, so I guess we'll see what she does then.

27:00.080 --> 27:06.160
Called Jamie's F.U. of the Week, and since she's not here tonight, I'm going to fill in my own little F.U. here of the week.

27:06.160 --> 27:11.160
Hi, um, my F.U. is awake.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.160
People who can't follow the three things open wide.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.160
I hate it when I'm up there and they say there's only one coin up on the machine.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.160
There's my coin up on the machine and I'm just kind of sitting down in the back watching.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.160
I was at some kind of place this week where this happened and I'm not going to say

27:27.160 --> 27:30.160
what the establishment's called or the dean was called.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.160
And then this other person comes up and puts their coin on the machine.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.160
There's a lot of these two coins on the machine.

27:34.160 --> 27:41.160
So when the person who's on the machine finishes their turn, the person who just put the coin up on the machine starts to go in.

27:41.160 --> 27:47.160
I'm like, hey wait a minute, did you see that other coin on there? It's like, oh no, sorry, my bad. I thought it was my turn.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.160
It's like in the store now. I think so.

27:51.160 --> 27:59.160
Like this person just had no concept of a wine. It was just kind of like, oh, put your token on the machine and I think you can go next.

27:59.160 --> 28:03.160
You know, I mean, this is why these people will put all their tokens in the machine.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.160
I'm like, okay, you can get one with me!

28:06.160 --> 28:09.160
Oh, then you put like four tokens up on the machine.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
This means I'm going to play it four times.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.160
And then, yeah, I'm like, okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.

28:19.160 --> 28:24.160
And when they do that, I pull them up and say, well, you know, this means fuck you, fuck all.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
I'm gonna play now.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.160
And you know what I hate about the token right now, so I was trying to explain it to parents.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.160
Because sometimes parents just don't understand.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.160
Yay!

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Okay, Will.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.160
Yeah, I know.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
Um...

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
Ahh...

28:38.160 --> 28:39.160
Baboo!

28:39.160 --> 28:40.160
I don't understand.

28:40.160 --> 28:46.160
Someone had to sit the dad down, like, and explain to him over, like, 15 minutes before he went to work.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
And then he just came back to work.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.160
Did they have to, like, draw out a map?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.160
Yeah.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.160
Like one of those wily coyote footprints?

28:52.160 --> 28:55.160
Yeah, but I don't understand if they have.

28:55.160 --> 29:03.160
You know, Harvard degrees, and they make millions of dollars and blah, blah, blah, but that's not an addition, a simple process of a plane line.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.160
What do you guys think about the plane line? Do you think this is an effective way to keep track?

29:07.160 --> 29:10.160
I mean, we all go to D.E.R. regularly, we all happen to go to the same place.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.160
We all waited until the line, a lot of people here waiting in the line. Do you think it works, or what?

29:15.160 --> 29:18.160
No, what other kind of methods do we have?

29:18.160 --> 29:20.160
It works when you have like a few people playing.

29:20.160 --> 29:29.160
We've got like eight people waiting to play and there's just so many children that you can't even remember which one's yours or when you're going up because there's so many on there.

29:29.160 --> 29:34.160
I think once you get somewhere like four people, then you need to find another way.

29:34.160 --> 29:40.160
Oh, I just think that it's easy to just have a little rat on the side of the screen that they put on some video game scenes.

29:40.160 --> 29:45.160
And that's when that person came around that I looked at today, took a little sauce, wanted to write three poems,

29:45.160 --> 29:49.160
that you just remember your number and you just kind of want to know your numbers like that.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.160
You know what bugs me about that system sometimes,

29:51.160 --> 29:54.160
I was at Stockton Golf and a local system at that system too,

29:54.160 --> 29:58.160
where they have their slots that say one through eight

29:58.160 --> 30:00.160
and you put your coin up there so you remember what number you're in.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
But sometimes people go up there,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.160
they take their coin out of number one,

30:04.160 --> 30:07.160
and then they move all the other coins over one space,

30:07.160 --> 30:11.160
which I can see the point of that if all the coins did look the same.

30:12.160 --> 30:16.160
The thing is that it's very confusing because you don't know what to do.

30:16.160 --> 30:21.160
Did you get your coin, but you moved them down? Did someone else put their coin in the place or something?

30:21.160 --> 30:25.160
And then, you know. Oh, yeah.

30:25.160 --> 30:28.160
I want to buy you the triple chocolate. You can't touch that.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.160
Okay, I didn't see that right.

30:31.160 --> 30:35.160
Sometimes it starts with outlines and then it shows as well.

30:35.160 --> 30:38.160
Sometimes it starts with an outline and you put your coin up, you know, maybe number 3.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.160
And then you get shots each time.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.160
And then it starts with an outline and then it's leading the dance on the head.

30:44.160 --> 30:55.160
Oh no, Stockton's golf land problem is not getting glorious game numbers as part of the problem, but I would say their four year old princesses are a much bigger problem than even at Roseau Golf Land.

30:55.160 --> 31:02.160
Stockton's Golf Land has some mean children. I mean, the ones above the golf land are snotty children, but the ones at Stockton's Golf Land are mean.

31:02.160 --> 31:12.160
They'll like step on your feet, they'll throw all the coins off the machine. They're the type that when you play Monopoly, you know, you're going around and if they lose the game they just throw everything up in the air and go, I quit.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.760
I quit. You lose, you suck.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.960
What fun would I have?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.060
Hahaha.

31:16.060 --> 31:18.060
Do you have a problem with it, mom?

31:18.060 --> 31:19.660
Oh, I could be at school if I ran the car.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.160
Yay!

31:20.160 --> 31:20.860
Haha.

31:21.860 --> 31:24.860
What about other methods other than the token life?

31:24.860 --> 31:25.860
There's the list.

31:25.860 --> 31:28.860
The list. How does the list work?

31:28.860 --> 31:30.860
You write your name.

31:30.860 --> 31:34.160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. But how, does it work? Is it good?

31:34.160 --> 31:38.660
It depends on how many people. It's pretty pointless if you only have, you know, a handful of people.

31:38.660 --> 31:45.660
But, you have like, remember in the previous cell phone when they first started using our machines how to do 40 people a night?

31:45.660 --> 31:47.660
I think it works very effectively.

31:47.660 --> 31:53.660
I remember we used to do that at Roosevelt and when we got the fourth next machine and we had a sign up sheet going on there.

31:53.660 --> 31:55.660
But, then it just kind of stopped.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.660
Or it didn't go on until we stopped doing it.

31:57.660 --> 32:03.660
Because, you know, it works with a group of people each other all the time.

32:03.660 --> 32:08.160
When there are people that just want to go up and play, you know, they don't know what they're doing.

32:08.160 --> 32:13.660
They don't know anything about any coin mining or lists that they have to put their name on.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.660
They won't think it's fair. No complaining about it.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.660
But I would say a sign-up sheet is easier to show somebody.

32:18.660 --> 32:24.660
Like, hey, we've got a system going on here than trying to explain why 10 coins are all up on the machine right now.

32:24.660 --> 32:29.660
People who are parents, I don't know, or people who don't play CGR in an arcade scenario,

32:29.660 --> 32:32.660
Oh, I don't see that. As much as they would see a sign up sheet that says, you know,

32:32.660 --> 32:34.660
write your name below if you'd like to get in line with mine.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.660
Well, maybe they just shouldn't write it yet.

32:36.660 --> 32:37.660
Maybe they sh-

32:37.660 --> 32:39.660
Hey, oh. Maybe they shouldn't break up in the morning.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
Hey, Matt! Maybe they shouldn't shoot themselves.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
Oh, sorry. I don't think that's true.

32:44.660 --> 32:46.660
Stupid people aren't here. It's stupid.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.660
So, what are you looking at?

32:48.660 --> 32:49.660
I don't know.

32:49.660 --> 32:52.660
Stupid people can't do anything by us saying that.

32:52.660 --> 32:55.660
Exactly. That's what usually happens. They put us in it.

32:55.660 --> 32:59.660
They should do is establish some sort of bowling system.

32:59.660 --> 33:03.660
You know how they have a bowling alley where you type your name in and then your turn comes around?

33:03.660 --> 33:07.660
Well they should do that, you know, have something like that where you just get one turn

33:07.660 --> 33:11.660
but you're suggesting that they invest, because all plants have already or whatever place

33:11.660 --> 33:14.660
has these DR machines already paid $5,000 for their machines.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.660
Well in some cases they paid $1,000 for a bullet.

33:16.660 --> 33:20.660
But nevertheless they paid at least $1,000 to get this machine

33:20.660 --> 33:24.660
and now they're going to invest another $1,000 just so that people can get one.

33:24.660 --> 33:30.660
Oh sure, kids, I mean, look at the video maps you have created. How fast does that make its money back?

33:30.660 --> 33:33.660
I bet it's paid for itself within the first two weeks.

33:33.660 --> 33:36.660
Sure, it's worth a black market, I'm sure it is.

33:39.660 --> 33:46.660
But is it worth it to buy another thing just so people didn't mind? I mean, because people are constantly replying anyway, it doesn't matter.

33:46.660 --> 33:49.660
Yeah right, they probably wouldn't understand either of those.

33:49.660 --> 33:56.660
I don't know. I think a lot of it is the arcade really doesn't give a shit who goes when, if honest, there's constantly quarters that you put in the machine.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.660
We only have two working machines in those little plans.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.160
Yeah.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.660
But they don't, they don't care. They're not gonna like it.

34:02.660 --> 34:06.660
It's, it's being suggested in the chatroom that everybody just be given their own machine.

34:06.660 --> 34:07.660
There it is.

34:07.660 --> 34:08.160
Right.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.660
It's a solo machine.

34:09.660 --> 34:10.660
It's a solo machine.

34:10.660 --> 34:12.660
Look at all the solo machines you're taking away.

34:12.660 --> 34:14.660
Absolutely. They can see if they're solo machines.

34:14.660 --> 34:19.660
At least a solo bass machine that is a little bit late for that.

34:19.660 --> 34:23.660
Solo bass is by far the worst ER mix we've ever made.

34:23.660 --> 34:28.660
But Solo 2000, Solo 2000 is a little better.

34:28.660 --> 34:30.660
At least have like twice as many songs.

34:30.660 --> 34:31.660
It's got some non-stops.

34:31.660 --> 34:34.660
You can change all your difficult voice panels.

34:34.660 --> 34:39.660
Is solo bass the one that was in SoCal, the one other than RKL?

34:39.660 --> 34:40.660
We want to know.

34:40.660 --> 34:41.660
It's not there anymore though.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.660
We have to get to that.

34:43.660 --> 34:48.220
That one was not bad. You know what the worst one for me is? It's 1.5.

34:48.220 --> 34:53.860
But it would ever. Anything 1.5 before if there was ever 1.6 before.

34:53.860 --> 34:59.140
Yeah but at least I got the retro value at this point. You know whenever somebody plays Boom Boom Dollar

34:59.140 --> 35:01.460
it's like oh you're being retro. You're going to lose a dollar.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.420
But if somebody's playing...

35:03.420 --> 35:04.100
What happened?

35:04.100 --> 35:10.140
If somebody's playing, I don't know, what was the solo bass song? I don't even know what songs were on that machine.

35:10.140 --> 35:11.180
I Know Why.

35:11.180 --> 35:18.180
The most annoying paranoia was on a live with some anime evolution, super stars, typical tropical.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.180
I'm gonna get typical tropical, they just go, what is that?

35:21.180 --> 35:23.180
I don't know.

35:23.180 --> 35:28.180
I feel like I'm still always fixed now. I want to live 4th now. I hate 4th now.

35:28.180 --> 35:33.180
That's another thing so much about when you pick 4th now or 6th now or 3th now.

35:33.180 --> 35:39.180
You know, 3th now, I'm not any more incorrect so I don't give a shit.

35:39.180 --> 35:43.580
It's beautiful. I don't, you know, I don't care. But, yeah, I write it.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.180
I mean, she writes syringes in her spare time.

35:46.180 --> 35:50.180
Exactly, you know! I own a ranch, but you can write a syringe.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.180
Yeah, um, yeah!

35:53.180 --> 36:01.180
Anyway, yeah, so, I, that's kind of one of the benefits of soles, is that you can take N4 and 3, right?

36:01.180 --> 36:02.180
You can take 3.

36:02.180 --> 36:07.180
So, I mean, that 3 is what, up, left, and right? You can also use the upper left and the upper right.

36:07.180 --> 36:10.180
He's down in the upper left hand.

36:12.180 --> 36:14.180
This is my EPT dancer mode.

36:15.180 --> 36:16.180
Yeah, whatever.

36:18.180 --> 36:19.180
What, I'm sorry?

36:24.180 --> 36:27.180
Combine pump it up in DVR and that's all that.

36:27.180 --> 36:28.180
No, not in DVR.

36:28.180 --> 36:32.180
This is not the classic person's first pose on most DVR bullets and boards, though.

36:32.180 --> 36:34.180
If I shouldn't have made the 9th level DVR,

36:34.180 --> 36:43.180
Do you think Konami is just waiting to do this or do you think it's not practical for a Nintendo VR or what?

36:43.180 --> 36:47.180
How does that not work?

36:47.180 --> 36:54.180
Oh, so that's a lot of stuff to be watching, although, granted, if you can do 2DX, which is 8 things you have to watch,

36:54.180 --> 37:00.180
or keyboard mania, which is what, like 26, 52 if you're playing doubles, things you have to watch,

37:00.180 --> 37:05.180
It's, you only have two feet, and you're not paying attention to how much something is on it.

37:05.180 --> 37:10.180
I don't know, it'd be worth a try, it'd be fun, but I don't think it's going to be a fashion market.

37:10.180 --> 37:14.180
And that's why Techno Motions is taking off, because it's super fun.

37:14.180 --> 37:19.180
Yeah, that's the, um, and that's the Korean one that you gave to me.

37:19.180 --> 37:24.180
Four pounds, five pounds, or eight pounds, or four times, there's no nine pounds on that now.

37:24.180 --> 37:28.180
But, yeah, it's like everybody, hey everybody's doing techno motions!

37:30.180 --> 37:34.180
There's lights in the motion, and you can't see, and it's sticking in my finger right now.

37:34.180 --> 37:36.180
Ah, ah, okay.

37:39.180 --> 37:43.180
So, back to the coin line. You think you guys think it's effective for now?

37:43.180 --> 37:45.180
You don't, you don't know any better, I'll tell you.

37:45.180 --> 37:48.180
What should, what should I, what should, what should,

37:48.180 --> 37:51.180
How can we better educate everybody on the coin line?

37:51.180 --> 37:54.460
So they're just invited people to see the show right now.

37:54.460 --> 37:54.960
Huh?

37:54.960 --> 37:55.460
I'm done.

37:55.460 --> 37:55.960
I'm done.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.460
I'm done.

37:56.460 --> 37:56.960
Ha!

37:56.960 --> 37:57.460
Very practical.

37:57.460 --> 37:57.960
Thank you.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.460
I'm done.

37:58.460 --> 37:58.960
I'm done.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.460
I'm done.

37:59.460 --> 37:59.960
I'm done.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.460
I'm done.

38:00.460 --> 38:00.960
I'm done.

38:00.960 --> 38:05.960
Oh, you mean my... tell them how, how can you...

38:05.960 --> 38:09.460
How do you think our kids need to get in and get involved?

38:09.460 --> 38:12.460
Do you think, do you think that our kids should have a sign posted saying,

38:12.460 --> 38:13.960
hey, here's a coin line policy.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.460
So that way parents go up and go, my kids been waiting.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.460
If we're waiting, we are.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.460
You don't want to decide you're shaking all of those.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.460
You can't please don't care. They're there to breathe their tubes and have somebody else say these to them.

38:25.460 --> 38:28.460
And if it takes more than two thoughts, which is, where's the access?

38:28.460 --> 38:31.460
It's like, uh-uh, they don't care.

38:31.460 --> 38:34.460
They don't care. They just want to give them their money and give them their keys.

38:34.460 --> 38:36.460
Well, fuck them. Maybe they should care.

38:36.460 --> 38:38.460
Well, you know, when parents say stuff like that...

38:38.460 --> 38:40.460
Will they care if I step on their child?

38:40.460 --> 38:43.460
Yeah, you should say, what do you know? There's a nice bucket of syringes on here.

38:43.460 --> 38:45.460
Do you really want to say goodbye?

38:45.460 --> 38:47.460
No, I'll speak for him.

38:47.460 --> 38:53.460
Oh, actually, I think that, both friends especially, do they really want those angry people

38:53.460 --> 38:56.460
that are yelling that the players are yelling at them?

38:56.460 --> 38:59.460
They need to say, oh hell, fuck the players, let them yell at them.

38:59.460 --> 39:02.460
So, what's the point?

39:02.460 --> 39:07.460
There's a little more to that, because if people are yelling at the players, the players are obviously,

39:07.460 --> 39:11.460
even when the players point at people complaining, they're going to go back to girlfriend, you know,

39:11.460 --> 39:13.460
and complain, it doesn't matter.

39:13.460 --> 39:15.460
They're always going to get complaints, doesn't matter.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.460
It's just a matter of who's gonna complain.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.460
So, maybe you can tell me about it.

39:19.460 --> 39:21.460
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.460
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.460
Yeah, I mean, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

39:26.460 --> 39:31.460
For my senses, um, either they won't do it or they'll take a long time to do it.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.460
So, I, I don't know.

39:33.460 --> 39:36.460
But, I mean, I've seen some teachers were separate from them, so.

39:36.460 --> 39:42.460
But I don't know, as far as the little coin line, it's more than implied saying that there's no set rule

39:42.460 --> 39:44.460
that anyone has to follow a coin line.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.460
You know, they can just say, fuck off, I'm going to play right now.

39:47.460 --> 39:51.460
I'm going to fuck off, I'm going to play right now.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.460
Now that's something else that bothers me that I see.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.460
This happens at the really, really crowded places.

39:57.460 --> 40:01.460
Say, an arcade in the Bay Area is the very first place to be a brand new machine.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.460
50 coins up on the damn machine.

40:03.460 --> 40:05.460
You have no idea who's going when.

40:05.460 --> 40:07.460
Somebody will just put their coin up there.

40:07.460 --> 40:10.460
If they'll leave, they'll go play some better games for an hour or whatever.

40:10.460 --> 40:13.460
Then they'll come back and go, oh by the way, it's my turn.

40:13.460 --> 40:20.460
That, that, I don't know. Do you think that if somebody puts a coin up they should be obligated to wait there until it's their turn?

40:20.460 --> 40:23.460
They put that thing in their dues, they should wait there?

40:23.460 --> 40:24.460
To go?

40:24.460 --> 40:29.460
Oh, not necessarily. I always end up leaving coins on the machine and I'll just say,

40:29.460 --> 40:32.460
okay, there's two people in front of me, that's enough time to play one game,

40:32.460 --> 40:34.460
here, here, come back and watch.

40:34.460 --> 40:38.460
You know, I kind of estimate how many people are going to be in front of me and then

40:38.460 --> 40:43.460
But what I use when I put my coin up to go push that mouse to come back to go click on the machine.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.460
And I see what I know when we hit the pocket.

40:45.460 --> 40:50.460
Like, if there's ten coins up on the machine, like three or four weeks ago,

40:50.460 --> 40:54.460
and I was a girlfriend and all these people on the boards,

40:54.460 --> 40:56.460
on the second money boards were talking about,

40:56.460 --> 41:00.460
now they hear how people just put their coins up and then leave and come back out and they're like,

41:00.460 --> 41:04.460
oh it's my turn to get these mother's coins at that five times.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.460
So what I do is I put my coin up to count how many are before,

41:07.460 --> 41:10.760
And as soon as that person's done playing, I yell out to the whole arcade,

41:10.760 --> 41:15.160
I'm nesting five people! No one takes my turn!

41:15.160 --> 41:18.160
And then so everyone knows, just like when my turn.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.360
And it's worked every time.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.760
That's why, that's kind of similar to what I tried to do when I did my coin mine.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.760
If I put my coin up, I go, okay, who is the last person to put their coin up?

41:26.760 --> 41:29.660
I'm going after that person, the hell with the rescue.

41:29.660 --> 41:33.360
Although, I almost got killed by a little kid, a little, I think a little four year old,

42:03.360 --> 42:05.360
The music video is expressed on a live video!

42:05.360 --> 42:06.360
Who's watching the video?!

42:06.360 --> 42:10.360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

42:13.860 --> 42:18.360
Have you guys heard of any other methods of keeping track of the coin whenes besides, er,

42:18.360 --> 42:22.360
I'm sorry, keeping track of when the return is for the money besides coin whenes,

42:22.360 --> 42:23.360
fine as sheets?

42:23.360 --> 42:24.360
Right off the smart ass helmet.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.360
I know, I punch you in the face.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.360
Thank you. Thank you, Redhead.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.360
How about maturity?

42:30.360 --> 42:31.360
How about the maturity?

42:31.360 --> 42:35.840
I think that's really the thing that's important here, because if somebody else has turned,

42:35.840 --> 42:40.480
it is, you know, before you were acting, you can say, you know, I know when I turn.

42:40.480 --> 42:45.760
And if somebody's wrong, I'm not the best now. You can just let them go, and you know you're the best.

42:45.760 --> 42:50.880
Because that person, Elizabeth, says, it's my turn, and they also did that for you because you selected your answer.

42:50.880 --> 42:55.360
And that's what I saw and all, but you're talking about video games on the most immature pastimes on the planet.

42:55.360 --> 43:00.240
And then, after waiting for ten people, and she's going, no, but I was after him.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.240
Yeah, well I wasn't kind of cut in front of me even though I was before him.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.240
And then the next person goes, but I was before him.

43:06.240 --> 43:09.240
Yeah, see that's where emotions start to crash.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.240
The times I try to be nice is exactly what's happened.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.240
And then it's like, okay, why did I bother?

43:14.240 --> 43:15.240
Why should I bother?

43:15.240 --> 43:17.240
Is that my education by gunpoint?

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Yeah!

43:18.240 --> 43:22.240
So what the news is is how, just like the customer service desk that's hard to get

43:22.240 --> 43:25.240
and that belly and stuff, they now serve inside.

43:25.240 --> 43:28.240
You take a number, you know, wait your turn

43:28.240 --> 43:32.240
And then once you see them pillow, oop, out of the point of the machine, now it's serving.

43:32.240 --> 43:37.240
I was actually thinking that would be a great, great system to use in a tournament, actually,

43:37.240 --> 43:40.240
because I don't know how many tournaments you guys have been into, the EA portions,

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
and what makes it happen, everybody's qualifying.

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
It's like, they'll call the next person and then they'll say,

43:44.240 --> 43:48.240
Oh, that guy's playing, ah, they're up there right now.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.240
We've got to go get them when their game's finished.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.240
And everybody's standing around there waiting for two minutes.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.240
I think in a tournament that would be a good idea to use.

43:54.240 --> 44:00.240
These little pull-pass things are not necessarily pull-passes, but have the little counter, and it's like your number is so-and-so.

44:00.240 --> 44:07.240
So when it's about four people before you, you better be waiting by the machine, because you're trying to qualify or you're out.

44:07.240 --> 44:11.240
I thought that was a good way to speed up urban detection in the future, getting around those mistakes.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.240
But do you think that would have worked in a normal arcade setting?

44:14.240 --> 44:16.240
A few, four, two, five?

44:16.240 --> 44:17.240
You look through a lot of these apps.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.240
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah, yeah.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.240
And who's going to pay that?

44:20.240 --> 44:23.240
And I'm going to take five in a row, so I get to go five times.

44:23.240 --> 44:27.240
If you see something that's not here, watch this video.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.240
And then over here, alright, so...

44:30.240 --> 44:31.240
Look at that!

44:31.240 --> 44:33.240
This is every day!

44:33.240 --> 44:35.240
This is like playing the lottery.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.240
Do I have to? Oh yeah!

44:37.240 --> 44:39.240
So you just want to do 30 or something like that.

44:39.240 --> 44:43.240
And then once you're done, you take it from the top.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.240
So watch having those little members at Carl's Jr.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.240
Well what happens to those members at Carl's Jr.?

44:47.240 --> 44:49.240
They get stolen!

44:49.240 --> 44:57.240
This is...how many of those a-hole hecklers now are gonna just take numbers and go away though?

44:57.240 --> 44:59.240
Ah, let's just put this away.

44:59.240 --> 45:05.240
The problem is that we're gonna go way too far too down to do anything if there's no way.

45:05.240 --> 45:12.240
But everyone, everyone here agrees then probably the topian line's the most effective thing for now or do you think it's...

45:12.240 --> 45:15.240
Actually, we would have started doing something else by then.

45:15.240 --> 45:18.240
Oh, you know, and we're gonna be trendsetters here.

45:18.240 --> 45:22.240
Well, we're reaching out to the masters. We can be...

45:24.240 --> 45:27.240
Oh, then we use the toy key and set everyone's name on separate coils.

45:27.240 --> 45:31.240
And then we roll the strings down and put whatever coil it lands on.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.240
Oh, hi.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.240
Hi.

45:33.240 --> 45:34.240
Alrighty, alright.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.240
That's a hush.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.240
You see? You know, Mom?

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
Yes.

45:39.240 --> 45:43.240
Unless it's our machine, we can't really establish anything.

45:43.240 --> 45:49.240
We can try to do a lot of stuff, but you know, it's not our machine.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.240
I know we care about it, but we should only do so much.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.240
It's not our machine.

45:54.240 --> 45:57.240
I mean, people are the ones that spend the money on it.

45:57.240 --> 45:59.240
They don't use a craft.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.240
They don't have to fix a toy, fix a token.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.240
That's all they care about.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.240
They don't care about you and their feelings.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.240
And they don't care about it.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.240
If you spend five dollars, that's five.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
It's totally ours.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.240
Exactly.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.240
It's not our machine.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.240
We can't, you know, make it a kind of

46:12.240 --> 46:14.240
I'm trying to fool over it, so...

46:14.240 --> 46:18.240
Shouldn't our data take that extra responsibility on the bad idea of it?

46:18.240 --> 46:21.240
What, they forgot their thing? Maintain the bad idea of it?

46:21.240 --> 46:23.240
Oh, you mean work? No, I'm talking about...

46:23.240 --> 46:25.240
I'm talking about, uh, the lines.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.240
Oh, oh, sorry.

46:26.240 --> 46:32.240
I mean, fighting games have had this problem since, you know, Street Fighter 2 came out, you know?

46:32.240 --> 46:35.240
Well, I guess the token lines kind of evolved.

46:35.240 --> 46:37.240
They are a family amusement center, correct?

46:37.240 --> 46:40.240
So they should be doing something to manage it, you know?

46:40.240 --> 46:46.240
And as usual, most places have four test scores.

46:46.240 --> 46:53.240
And there's nothing you can do about it until something either gets killed or gets sued or gets fired.

46:53.240 --> 46:57.240
I forget about it. When I look at this, people don't know how to take turns.

46:57.240 --> 47:03.240
When we went out in the chair garden. How sad is it when we can't take turns?

47:03.240 --> 47:07.240
People don't understand the concept of taking turns. That's really sad.

47:07.240 --> 47:10.240
It's really sad. Why do these people argue this for a living?

47:10.240 --> 47:12.240
They understand. They just don't want to do it.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.240
These are people who play our plays, you know?

47:14.240 --> 47:17.240
They're serving our government.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.240
Right in our country.

47:23.240 --> 47:27.240
I'm not that cool. I don't have that good of a job.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
Okay, it's just a cross section of America.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.240
Well, cross section of the society of America.

47:32.240 --> 47:39.240
All right, am I also going to say anything on the coin lines, taking turns, things they

47:39.440 --> 47:43.440
should have learned in kindergarten, things like that?

47:43.440 --> 47:49.440
And on that note, we're going to take another break. We'll be right back.

47:49.440 --> 47:56.440
This is where you'll take the CD for ear. To the brand new world we're going to solve for Captain J.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.440
Hey, how are you?

48:26.440 --> 48:28.440
Oh

48:56.440 --> 49:20.720
I see the world by the hand of a stranger I see the world by the hand of a stranger

49:50.720 --> 49:52.720
Oh yeah!

49:52.720 --> 49:55.720
Oh yeah!

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
You're so good, boy.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.220
This is perfect!

49:58.220 --> 50:00.220
This is all I got.

50:00.220 --> 50:01.720
It's really good.

50:01.720 --> 50:02.720
Come on.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.720
It's really good.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.720
This is so cool.

50:07.720 --> 50:11.720
I love this show.

50:11.720 --> 50:14.720
Oh, yeah!

54:14.720 --> 54:16.720
Oh

54:44.720 --> 54:46.720
Oh

55:44.720 --> 55:59.720
Orange Lounge Radio, a modern music and more program, might be interesting to listen to in the kitchen.

55:59.720 --> 56:04.720
We have reported incidents where exposed listings in this program in the kitchen

56:04.720 --> 56:10.720
has caused people to bust out a shabby fan, draw arrows on the tile, and start stomping away.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.720
The Family Public Service Announcement of Orange Lounge Radio.

56:15.720 --> 56:19.720
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

56:20.720 --> 56:28.720
I want to turn the mic over to Mr. Paul, a.k.a. Pauliver, to talk about Drama Drama Revolution.

56:28.720 --> 56:32.720
Yes, that would be all of the drama that goes on in the online community,

56:32.720 --> 56:35.720
on all the different golden doors out there.

56:35.720 --> 56:39.720
Paul volunteered, I guess every week he didn't help us out with this.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.720
You know, there's a lot of stuff I've been waiting for.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.080
There's a lot of stuff in our show.

56:43.080 --> 56:49.920
Well, every week, if there's enough material, material pending, and Paul continues to the show, uh, pending or whatever,

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
Paul wants to give a wrap-up.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.420
And we're gonna call it Drama Drama Revolution.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.620
So go forth, Paul.

56:56.620 --> 57:02.220
Last time on The Last of Money, Antonio and Matt, and Americano and Bi-Boy,

57:02.220 --> 57:06.520
were curious and curious as one of those to turn into a giant dragon eating themselves for breakfast.

57:06.520 --> 57:10.520
She poured more milk on them than they need them across the place.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
To help the flavor.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.520
And that's how I came in.

57:15.520 --> 57:18.520
These are my powers, Yoda's and Bo's.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.520
And we tried to, you know, build the water and the whole thing.

57:21.520 --> 57:24.520
But this was just a failure.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.520
And then, on the off-grid, I couldn't read anything.

57:28.520 --> 57:32.520
This was all the summary and then I had to put the pen.

57:32.520 --> 57:44.520
I'm, uh, Jeannie Cohen, from The People of Brisbane, uh, three of the four of you I think have done, and four of us, have to try to, uh, transition on, one day, on, uh, local picture board.

57:44.520 --> 57:45.520
Oh, yeah?

57:45.520 --> 57:46.520
Can you hear someone?

57:46.520 --> 57:47.520
Yeah.

57:47.520 --> 57:49.520
Just try to help, Paul.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.520
Uh, try, uh, try to help me.

57:51.520 --> 57:54.520
Uh, and, uh, this is why I need to write this.

57:54.520 --> 57:55.520
Yeah?

57:55.520 --> 57:57.520
We don't write the show, I see you could write the show.

57:57.520 --> 57:58.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:58.520 --> 58:00.520
Look behind the show!

58:00.520 --> 58:05.520
I mean, God, everyone just died. Everyone died, I mean.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.520
Any other board you want to wrap up for us?

58:09.520 --> 58:11.520
Everyone's dead, I don't know.

58:12.520 --> 58:13.520
Alright, well, don't drop out of the pollution.

58:13.520 --> 58:15.520
Thank you very much, boss. Or something like that.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.520
Irene has a joke. Alright, we'll call a joke and then we'll come back.

58:25.520 --> 58:29.200
We'll take it quick break and then come back for the top of the hour.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.320
Or whatever.

58:31.300 --> 58:31.800
Yeah.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.500
See, was that your joke?

58:35.040 --> 58:37.920
What do you call a deer that has no eyes?

58:38.440 --> 58:38.940
What?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.440
No idea!

58:40.440 --> 58:42.920
What do you call a deer that has no eyes and no legs?

58:42.920 --> 58:43.420
What?

58:43.660 --> 58:45.180
Still no idea!

58:45.180 --> 58:46.080
Ahahaha!

58:46.080 --> 58:46.840
No!

58:46.840 --> 58:47.960
I don't know!

58:47.960 --> 58:48.680
Alright.

58:49.080 --> 58:49.860
I'll take that.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.360
Oh gee.

58:51.360 --> 58:55.240
Anyway, we're gonna do another song and we'll be back.

58:55.240 --> 58:55.740
Real Prime!

59:55.240 --> 01:00:25.160
Hey, alrighty, it is eight o'clock, it's the time of the hour, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our second broadcast, if you couldn't tell, we're still doing this.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.160
But thank you guys for joining us on this early broadcast of Orzam's Radio.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.160
My co-host, DarkSakura, is out of town because she's gone off to Anime Expo.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.160
So filling in this week, it's the lovely rice princess, Irene. Say hello, Irene.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.160
Ah, hello, Irene.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.160
You're very famous in the Bomani community for something, Irene.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.160
I don't know if you want me to bring this up on the show, but I think it's funnier.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.160
You want to tell us about it, what you're famous for in the scene?

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.520
You want me to explain it? Well, we had this tournament in Sacramento back in October.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.800
We are stacked. Sacramento's cosplay and tournament.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800
No dirty connotations at all needed.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.440
And you happen to be one of our judges from Risa.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.160
Uh, because we, uh, we ended up having an equal, I believe, male and female judges.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.160
No, we had more female judges than male judges, didn't we?

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:17.320
Um, I don't remember, because we had you, we had Wanna Girl, Sharks Girl, and Dr. Cora.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.840
Yeah, we had three male judges.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.840
I didn't want to judge you for that. But you were, you were the infamous judge on my channel.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840
Oh, yes, yes.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.840
Because you wrote on somebody's card, um, I would have given you a higher score. What was it you wrote on his card?

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.840
I believe, um, a higher score would have been given this year or was it you?

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840
Yes.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.840
And I gave them a score of 8.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840
Yes.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Which is a bad score.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
Which is a B!

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
You know, what's wrong with a B?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
You know, but anyway.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.840
But you, you took a lot of heat. Well, you didn't take a lot of heat for this movie.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.840
All of a sudden I looked at the heat bar, but that's okay.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.120
And you know why?

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.840
You know why?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.280
I don't know for a moment.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.960
No, no, no, that's fine.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.240
You know, so, yeah, anyway, I guess I just think that this is...

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.120
The hell with drama drama revolution is you're smart.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.000
You take a lot and go, like, don't get on these online things.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.840
Oh, wait a minute, you're on the online radio show.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.760
Yes, I am, but I like this.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.960
I don't care about if people get mad.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.600
Is there any other comments you want to give on that?

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.480
Like, you know, I need to get back.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.080
What do you have to say to the people that are like,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:22.080
What the hell are you thinking in a mirror thing and why would you give it a little score and of course you use mirrors.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080
Well, like breakfast. Fuck the police.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:33.080
Well, um, I can judge however I want to. That was one of the criteria of judging was judge however you want to and don't be biased or anything.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:40.080
You know, nearly the boring thing to me, everybody uses mirroring and my face enjoys the audience but I don't give a shit.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.080
I tried to sit backwards, you know, and, you know, I tried to do something different.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.080
Yes, it was all the same shit, and it was good.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.080
And I gave him a high score, 80 is a high score.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080
You know, that's a B, like I said.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.080
So, you know, and then he wanted to be a whiny and complaining shit.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080
You know, and I'm like, whatever, I don't care.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
Give me that one, give me that one.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.080
Uh-uh.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.080
Yeah, yeah, so, you know, that's all on that, I guess.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.080
Okay, well that's all your favorites in the community, so uh, I thought we'd maybe find that for the end of the week.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080
The only way I'm saying this, uh, yeah, yeah.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080
What is going on outside the other room?

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:24.080
Well, I just, I, you know, that, uh, Dave showed me the Fortnite extra challenge mode.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.080
Uh, it wasn't really, uh, I never checked out this challenge mode thing on, uh, Fortnite.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080
And it wasn't the last week.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080
What?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.080
Uh, forget it.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.080
Uh, sorry, I wasn't, yeah, really, I wasn't.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.080
No. But it's very difficult. Like, a lot of them didn't want you to hit the same arrow twice.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.580
So you had to play 59 and you couldn't hit the same arrow twice.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580
It was very, very nice.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.580
And the last one we did was, uh...

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.080
And it's how you never been low, and you had to hit...

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.580
360. Perfect.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.580
And it was all just running left and, like...

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.580
Yeah, 60 notes, just all the way down.

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:03.080
But it was just, like, left down, left down, left down, and really quickly all 50 notes.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080
I don't know. It's pretty weird.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.080
And I thought it was stupid. But yeah.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080
Okay! Oh great!

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.080
So do you have that sort of thing?

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080
There's a screeching train coming to a halt.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.080
That's what I'm doing. I know. I don't have a screeching train, but I do have a...

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
I'll get one of those. I'm going to be stopping the train.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080
Okay. That was stupid.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
I'm just bringing the show to a halt right now.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.080
You know what? You know what other great sound effects I have?

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080
I'm not going to be used for this yet, but you know what?

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.080
If Irene ever pisses you off, you could just, you know, say,

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080
Yeah, that was pretty good, didn't it?

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080
I'm not really sure.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080
There's no losing that.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080
It looks like half.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.080
Like, quarter of the Christmas tree looks like it ate the whole thing.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080
Anyways.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080
Anyways.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.080
Be good and sparkle!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.080
Um, this is a, uh, a room full of guys.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080
Can you see your guys?

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.080
Yes, well, I'm surprised you haven't found out, Mona.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.080
Well, thanks for finding out about our temporary goal, John.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.080
Anyway, speaking of Orange Lounge and everything,

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.080
outside of this talk show, the whole rest of the week we have a music program.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080
We are all sorts of Omani music.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.080
24-7 we throw in some dance media tracks,

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.080
some other stuff and some random games like Parappa, Bust-A-Move.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080
You know, all those other games that kind of led us to playing D.R.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.080
I don't know about you guys, but before I was playing D.R. I was playing Bust-A-Move

01:05:52.080 --> 01:06:01.080
and we have a segment called, not a give a money game, but should be, and one thing I've

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:07.080
been hearing from some people who have been listening to the stream very frequently is

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.080
like, you've had the same damn two songs all week long, you had Republic already to go,

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.080
which was my choice, because I thought that was a pretty cool song for guitar freaks to

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:26.580
to be a really good song, and also it's kind of that, it's got that vibe of it used to be a 90's hit, you know, a one hit wonder band, and it disappeared off the face of the planet.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:36.080
Republica is nowhere to be seen anymore, which is totally just like every other DER band and song I've seen. It's just a one hit wonder band that's not around anymore.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:42.080
So I thought it would be good for DER, and Jamie's hit was Shannon with the music playing, because Snow is a new song.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:57.080
We're finally replacing those two songs this week with some new songs.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.080
But I want to hear from the panelists here.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:03.080
This is kind of that old age old Ramani question.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
What song should be in the bandana this now already?

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.080
And my choice for this week is actually going to be an old kind of dating myself here.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.680
Uh, yeah, it's the phone call from the 80s, giving me my picture this week.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680
And I like phones.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.680
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, I know that phone. Yeah.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680
And the girl!

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680
Oh, yeah. Anyway.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.680
Anyway. Yeah.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.680
That's a good phone. That's a good choice.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.280
Because, I don't know. I kind of hear it as the 2DX song.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.080
Oh, yeah. I know. That's a good choice.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.280
But it's very... it fits, you know, perfectly.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.680
What song do you think should be in a Hermione game? What Hermione game was?

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:46.180
Well, I chose, uh, something for 2Dx, or, you know, 3A, and I chose a song called You're Not Alone by Ollie's that nobody knows that song.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.180
I know that song.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.180
Yeah, and nobody else.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.180
Yeah.

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:54.180
Which is okay, and, yeah, like, nobody knows that song, but it's a good song.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.180
It's just, it's huge.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.680
Why do you think this song should be in the air?

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.180
Because it's a good song.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.180
I think it fits perfectly, um, that song.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:09.280
So I'm playing it all over again.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.340
Yeah, I know you have to play 17th.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.400
Well, I know that I'm really out there as well.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400
Yeah, I know.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.000
Well, I think you have to how to understand.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.540
I'm using all of your vowels to me.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.540
Yeah, I think so.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.200
I'm using some of your own.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.500
Something.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.040
I think that kind of genre is it?

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.100
Like five vowels.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:31.600
Cool.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.100
Cool.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:32.600
I think so.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600
Where are you at?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.100
What song?

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.160
Okay, I just played the

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160
I played the three days last night, but

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160
the one I got wanted

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.160
you can have your crystal left more than you

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.160
but crystal left the phone

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
and all

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160
sorry what was it?

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160
name of the game, yeah

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.160
that should be a TX, but

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.160
if there was any song I wanted to hear

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160
that would be the one

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160
and that's just perfect

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.160
except like all of it

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160
scratching along with

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160
just some radio

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.160
sounds that look like a tack song

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.160
or something like that

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160
I don't know if you want to play that

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.160
for the audience or not

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160
I'm going to pull up my lap

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.160
lets see

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:07.160
Let's get on my computer here. It's in the directory there.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.160
This makes for a wonderful way. Anything else you want to say about the song?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.160
Which, what was it called again?

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160
Uh, name of the game. Name of the game.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.160
Uh, anything else you want to say about it?

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160
It's good.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.160
Oh, and it's kind of like, uh, Star Wars.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:35.040
cracking up

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.460
What's that number on you want

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.140
the money you want

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.820
Actually one more difference

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.600
is the T.R.A.N.C.E.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.720
or what they call it

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.720
Uh, what was it?

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.320
It's Amber Buffenbyard by, uh, Amy Hamasaki.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.920
I, yeah, nobody, nobody in the video asked me if you've ever heard of Amy Hamasaki.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.920
Uh, whatever, I don't care.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.920
You see, you think Amber should be at the, uh, uh, Amber Buffenbyard.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.920
Amber Buffenbyard.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120
I'm so happy to have her.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.840
But anyway, I can totally see this in the video.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.320
You know, when there are fans that are here behind them, that's kind of...

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:35.000
Actually, you know, I've been always covering most of the, uh, cover songs, such as the Netflix movie, uh...

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.360
Uh, naturally, we'd love to be able to explore the options.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.120
I have, like, almost every song with a listener.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.280
Yeah, actually. Cool, cool.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.360
What about you, Paul? What song?

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:54.360
This one's kind of popular, it's kind of funny, it's a popular one kind of dog, and it's really, really good old.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.360
It's really weird, and it's when people find me up front.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.360
It's called a butterfly.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360
It's a little band called Smile!

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.360
And I think it'll be so cool.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360
Five minutes ago called.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.360
Is this on VDR? I just wasn't born, I guess, before that one.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360
No, I didn't.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.360
If I came out, you know, only a couple of years ago, I knew like several years ago, that I was going to bed.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360
I don't care.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360
The age of 13.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
Yeah.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
You know what I'm saying?

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360
You know what I'm saying?

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Baby got fat.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.360
Isn't that on the King of the Hill thing when they get the ER parity on TV now?

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.360
Yeah, but hey, if there's a one-hit wonder in this world, it's baby got fat.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360
Sure mix floss is pretty popular.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360
Hold on.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360
Wait.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360
Why is that a mix floss?

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.360
I, I, the only other sure mix floss song I remember is, uh,

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360
Put It Up On It, Jump On It, or something like that.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360
Put It Up On It?

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360
What?

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360
Am I the only one listening to that?

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360
I know you did, Rob.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.360
Yeah, but I didn't listen to crap.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.360
Squirt of that crap?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.360
Yeah, I didn't say it.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.360
All I did was say it.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.360
I didn't listen to shit.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.360
But that was in the 90s.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.360
No, in the 80s?

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360
I'm sorry.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360
In the 80s, it was all about porn.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360
I know, right?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.360
Oh, well I should call that girl, it's like 1990, but anyway, who's counting?

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360
Is anybody else? Oh, look out there!

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360
Get, get there!

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360
Hang on the other row.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360
Hey, you guys!

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360
Baby?

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360
Baby?

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360
Oh, look at that ball in there.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360
Rocky?

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360
Really?

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.360
We want to hear what you guys think is, uh, should be in the money that's not already in the money.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360
Yeah, who wants to go?

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360
Why don't you go over there?

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.360
Alright, well I think it should be the new D.E.R. song or something like that.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.360
And it should be Baby Box's Love and Ecstasy.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
And why?

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.360
Because when they first started I thought it was the D.E.R. song

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.360
and I was like, oh it's not a D.E.R. song, okay bye.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360
Wonderful, thank you!

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.360
Hey, hey, alright, there you go, what's your choice?

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.360
I think it should be, uh, I don't know, I can't touch it.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.360
I need to pump it up.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360
I need to pump it up.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.360
He has all the crappy songs going to pump it up right now.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.360
No.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.360
I'm going to have to.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360
I'm going to have to.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360
I'm going to have to.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360
Freaky?

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360
You're going to find freaky?

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360
No.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360
Because I'm freaky.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360
It's kind of white.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
You can't match it.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Yeah.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
Super freaky.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360
Super freaky.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.360
Yeah.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.360
So that's disqualified.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.360
They don't give a damn about the show.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360
He just wants to show up.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360
Yeah.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360
Go to the page.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360
Bring me a phone.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.360
We're getting a suggestion from the chat room that, uh, in 2DX would be anything by that violinist trance shit.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.360
And I think you would be referencing, uh, Vanessa May.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Who, uh, is, is in a rotation right now on her spaceship.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.360
She has a song called Destiny off the Fantasia album.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.360
And, uh, this would be a great time to do that for me.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360
Good, good.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360
Vanessa May has tons and tons of stuff.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.560
And Jamie, Jamie's a big fan of the nuts and they should go off for a long, long time.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:10.560
Actually, if my memory serves me correctly, I believe that, um, uh, that, uh, the monitor would actually just need a plant for that one.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.360
Oh, that one!

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.360
I, I believe, I, I believe that.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.760
So if you can't get them in the real money games, you gotta take the emulation.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.360
Um, oh yes. I think I'm pushing the 100-some mark.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.360
Oh, actually, you're probably about right. Yeah, 1000.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:43.360
Well, I'm at 769 or something, are you talking about your own little collection you have on your computer that just basically you're trying to compile every set of fan made sets that are out there, and official ones, and stuff like that, maybe?

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:50.360
Okay, we also need to make more thin irons and rods in the sun.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.360
Can I have this outside?

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360
Yeah, sure.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360
Another one that's pretty cool.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.360
Another one is called Duck Toy.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360
I don't know.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360
That's by Heiferberg.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360
It's like that rape song.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360
I don't know.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.360
They're the era.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360
Big, cool, fat neck.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360
That needs to be seen here.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360
That's also my station on the station right now.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.360
We decided we'd throw it in some, uh, they're kinda related to Bemani, but not really things.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360
So we have some remixes in there.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.360
Cause people kinda get sick of the sound.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360
I'm working on it.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
This is...

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
Did you come in a file?

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
Did you come in a file?

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.360
Yeah, I did a video.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360
Any other news in the community right now?

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
Innovation-wise?

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.360
Innovation-wise, uh, the melting pot's down because T-viral slides down.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:37.360
Actually, this is a file now that, uh, dderaniac.net's pulling the, uh, nerf for, uh,

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.360
for a guest that's eventually seen to actually use a file converter and download the program again.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.360
Um, it's probably all going to come up tomorrow since that's when the month is up,

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360
and, you know, the bandwidth is probably gone.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360
Right, right. Cool.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.360
Alright, um, what do you think, are you just sticking to the break?

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360
Are any of the songs you ever want to add, or?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.360
No, I think they're still good for now.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360
Oh, they're coming up.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360
But that's not a trap.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.360
You know what would be a great time of the year?

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:07.360
The

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.360
The

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.360
The

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360
The

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360
The

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360
The

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
The

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
The

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360
The

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360
The

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.360
The

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.360
The

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.360
The

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360
The

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:39.360
You know what everybody would be saying if you started parrying to that song?

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.360
Are you playing?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more madness here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:56.360
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.360
Yay!

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360
Yay!

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360
Yay!

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360
Yay!

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360
Yay!

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360
Yay!

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.360
Nooooooo!

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.360
Are you sure you want me to do this?

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.360
Nooooo!

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.360
Are you sure you want me to do this?

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360
Nooooo!

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
Nooooo!

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360
Extreme of Bonnie Radio.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.360
That's us! Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360
Episode number two. Here we are.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360
And umm...

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360
Matt wanted to get in on the fun.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360
Earlier we were doing the app.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360
He was a wee kind of trying to fill in for Jamie.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.360
Absolutely she bought the anime so she was able to do it at the early age.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:41.360
So we had one for her and Matt also wanted to give in and she had a little bit of a rant that he wanted to say.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:46.360
Yeah, so my rant would be for those people that like to cut through a machine.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.360
Namely, Perper and Ciara.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:53.360
Perper, I always have people walking too close to me and I look bad to any of them and that kind of thing.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.360
Really, I don't care because they're dumb enough to walk that close.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360
I really don't care about hitting them.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.000
by hitting them, but then you get pissed off when they get hit, because they're watching too close.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.360
And I actually touched this today, I said in the middle of a pair of pair of machines,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.560
they'll suck my arm out, and then actually, it's inside the machine,

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.120
so these people are watching way too close to the machine.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.160
And, um, I hate them. I don't feel bad.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.080
Hehehe, I'm over here, that's a good way to sum it up.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.240
Um, that pisses me off too when people do that on DVR, and little kids do this all the time.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:30.240
You'll be up there dancing, doing your thing, and then suddenly you know how there's that little space between where the machine is and where the pad is?

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.240
A little kid decides that's the fastest way for them to go.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.240
So they'll run right between you and the machine when you're trying to play.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.240
Like when you're in the nose and on any course or something, they just run right through the machine.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.240
What the hell is that?

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.240
It's a little kid.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.240
I gotta say though, ever since...

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.240
Bad parenting.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:56.240
Um, what girlfriend did a little while ago is they took these little wooden platforms and kind of stuck them in between the machine and the pads.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.240
Which actually I think really helped that because now little kids if they want to do that have to take a step off.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.240
And I think most little kids are too lazy to do that so they throw around now.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.240
So I guess problem solved in some aspects.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.240
But now Para Para seems like it needs some kind of mote built around it or something.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.540
Seriously I couldn't hit most guy in the head.

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.140
He was like uh, uh, bad.

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.640
You were hitting a guy in the head?

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.740
Oh ok. He was standing there at 4 feet tall.

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.740
He was bending over and helping O2 with the super machine.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:29.240
And you know he was like the mad guy sitting on the guy you know now.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240
Because he's just.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.240
And he's just sitting there.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.740
You wanna share on the show?

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.240
Haha.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.740
I was playing it.

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:37.740
Oh yeah you were playing it.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.740
I was playing Para Para Para.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.240
About 2 or 3 people were at me.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:47.240
I really don't care, you know, but actually there's this one guy who had been standing there and just like trying to piss me off, you know.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.240
He's like, what are you doing? I'm like, you might want to move back, but you don't want to be hit.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240
So he just stands there and finally he walks away.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:59.240
He walks by, and as he walks by, I just haven't been put my hand out, and this backhand had done pretty well.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.240
It was pretty cool.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.240
Any suggestions on how ball fighting can fix this problem?

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240
Yeah.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240
Oh well, there's no...

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.240
There's no way to fix this problem.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:16.240
Um, just, you know, people need to watch where they're walking. I don't watch in front, I mean, especially like mocaps, I mean, like watching a cell phone play mocap boxing.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.240
I mean, you don't want to be in there if you don't watch in front of people.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.240
Nah, that's the key issue.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.240
Um, they can also really love all these practical solutions your dad's come up with.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.240
Rearrange the game, and you can't really just get out of the kitchen, John.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.240
I agree with, I agree with you. They should definitely rearrange the game since mocaps aren't working.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.240
We're not supposed to put that there, instead, it's a pair of terrible mocaps.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:46.240
That's a good idea. But the thing about, um, why they put hair here in the yarn stuff in the area that they do is because there's arches and they cannot fit through the arches.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.240
I mean, I don't know why they don't get so close, I guess, right now.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240
Cause it was, it's...

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240
That's too great, that. That's okay.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
They're so very cute.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240
Oh, they are.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240
I don't know. This is what they're saying.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.240
But that's why they keep them in that central area when you first walk.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.240
Oh, okay.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.240
Well, I'm, I don't know.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.240
Nobody cuts through that.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.240
Nobody cuts through sumo.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.240
Okay, I can't cut through my sumo.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.240
Heh heh heh.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240
Yeah, you know what?

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.240
I've made the differ. I think sumo is a very gay game.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240
I mean you get this big red ball that people are sitting in.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240
It's somewhat fashionable.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.240
Fashionable? Fashionable.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.240
Uh huh.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.240
Where is Shimon? Anyway, he should be on the show.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.240
Should I just unplug my camera? I hope not.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.240
Sweetie, make sure you have some water.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240
Sweetie, look at this, it just looks so weird.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240
Oh!

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240
Ok, let's do it.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240
14.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.240
When I open it up.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240
10.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.240
15.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240
16.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.240
17.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240
18.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240
19.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240
20.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.240
21.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240
21.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240
22.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240
23.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240
24.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240
25.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240
26.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240
27.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240
28.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240
29.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240
30.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240
31.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.240
32.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.240
33.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240
34.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.240
35.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.240
Well, there was these cavemen, and they were like bouncing up and down behind me, saying that they were, you know,

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:16.240
but I was mad because I was moving, but I was asking the other world without thinking anything of their type of name,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240
and so I said, you live by an Alice!

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.240
I don't know.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:25.240
But I didn't say anything. I just, well, I just stuck my finger out of it and happened to be the middle finger,

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.240
and he said, oh, you can't put me out.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.040
But I didn't begin, and he said,

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.040
Hey, if you do it again, I'm going to just grab something.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.040
So I didn't begin, and I said,

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.040
Fuck off, I'm going to get the security if you even try to do anything with me.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.040
Yeah, he ran away. I ran.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.040
But you know what?

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.040
Two hours later, when I'm leaving the park,

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.040
they're out there waiting for me.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.040
I mean, I guess they were that into it

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.040
that they went way out of the park in like two hours

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.040
for me to come out.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:14.040
They didn't do anything. But I guess you only get four or five guys together and it's like, oh, it's only one guy, so, you know, what is it? Strength in numbers or something like that?

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040
Yeah.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040
Yeah, that really works, right?

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040
Say hello to George, strength in numbers.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040
Yeah.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:29.040
I have never been officially a joy addict growing up.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Well, actually I think the problem has kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:41.040
I remember I used to be playing on USA Mix and stuff back when we had forest, you know,

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040
and just swapping out for that.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.040
I wish all of them had kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:53.040
I remember I used to be playing on, um, USA Mix and stuff back when we had fourth, you know, and just swapping off of that.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:58.040
And I actually had, you know, a little kid try to pick fights with me.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:03.040
For no reason! I was just playing the game and they just come up and try to pick a fight with me.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.040
You know, I just hit your ass. I'm like, that's, uh, where the hell did you come from?

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.040
And, um, first night, you know, Eric was there, and then I was like,

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.040
So, what the hell? What's your tune?

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040
And he's like, so you and I are trapped here.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.040
And he's like, dude, now where'd you find this guy?

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.040
He's just away.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040
And the other night, Canada was like, trapped here, basically.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040
But I have it right now.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you only see six months we love.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040
Exactly.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040
But I mean, I haven't had any kids in such advice with me.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.040
Especially little kids.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.040
That happens all the time. I mean, seriously.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.640
Remember that one kid?

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.240
Hey Brad, you were kind of cracking.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.960
He said, remember that he ever cracked kids?

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.640
Everybody did, he did, he did.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.680
Yeah, remember that one kid?

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.520
Remember that one kid?

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.640
Remember he was making fun of any of you?

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.840
Yes, because I remember every child that he had.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:59.200
Yeah, and then he goes and plays on TV and we throw up behind him and we see the crowd.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.080
What a little shit.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.600
I mean, he is kind of me.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.600
And then we all kind of go away because we found something more interesting to play for five minutes.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:08.600
I mean, when I say we all, it means it was like five, six, seven of us.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:13.600
And then this little kid, when we're not looking, gets on the machine and starts playing as if we're not gonna do it.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:19.600
And everyone's like, we got up, we all got up there and started cheering him on going, yeah, go, da da da.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.600
And then he failed the song and he ran to the bathroom and cried.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.600
And then I'm like, you're so awesome, I want your kid.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.600
And then that was it.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:34.600
I think the worst thing that ever happened, or not really the worst, but actually probably the most recent, was playing a machine.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.600
I had this guy, and they were just like standing there kind of mocking me,

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.600
and jump up, right in front of me with the camera, flash, and then jump off the machine.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.600
And he did that twice. I had people like, I had this black guy, you know, standing there,

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.600
and he goes, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.600
Then him and his friend came up, and they were like pretending to freak me,

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.000
And she was like, what the hell are you guys doing?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.600
I just thought you were a cool asshole.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.400
Yeah, you know, I do.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.000
Why didn't you jump on that shit, right?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
You're like, oh, right there, sis.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Oh, oh, yeah.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.400
Couldn't have found something.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.000
I hope this is not my apartment.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.600
No, you know, that's a reference to a movie.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.400
I'm not racist.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.600
Yeah, I think so.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.600
Yeah.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.800
Aw.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:16.600
You're racist.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.400
You're racist then.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:17.800
You gotta finish.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.600
You gotta finish.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.200
Uh, you know, that reminds me of, uh, an earlier incident

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200
I had online with people.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.200
The tenant took me away from me.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.200
What did he do to that?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.200
I sent her a name on my face.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.200
I said, Jamie, that's your guy's office.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.200
She's like, oh yes, that's my guy's office.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.200
I told her, I sent her a name.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.200
That one must be a quarter black.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.200
I'm the new pal.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.200
My friend's a gourmet.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.200
I was just talking about it, but I didn't think it was gonna be that bad.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.200
They were saying you were a quarter black,

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.200
or they were saying Jamie was a quarter black.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200
She's like, you're a gourmet.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.200
Are you a quarter-block?

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.200
Oh, I'm a quarter-block.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200
Okay.

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.200
Okay, yeah.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200
Anyway, let's change topic now.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200
I got physically removed by somebody from the machine.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.200
How do you get physically removed?

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.200
No, I came up onto the stage and grabbed me and threw me off the machine.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.200
I was secretly assaulted on the machine.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.200
Were you number eight on the computer machine?

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:42.200
I was like, yeah, you don't want to start eating with me because I'm white, that's Jimmy.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:50.200
Yeah. I could shoot you with my legs if you do. Really.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.200
That is brought with him to the show this week. A lovely VCD.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.200
You explain what the hell this is like. I still haven't figured it out.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.200
Yeah, I watched it and it's just one show and I still haven't figured it out.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.200
Um, actually what this is, it's a VCD, a classic VCD.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.200
We've got one that's called Para Para Dance and one that's Para Para Stadium.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200
Everyone knows what Para Para Stadium is.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:20.200
It's just Para Para All Stars doing new routines for different Para songs so you can learn them.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:27.200
But the first CD Para Para Dance is a bunch of different clips from this one variety show that's actually on TV.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.200
It's starring Takura Kimura.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.200
And, um, this guy, that's it.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.200
Yeah, that's, I believe it's Paku Ya, Paku Ya Tamera.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.200
Just kidding. Alright, that's, that's it.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:45.200
Anyways, what this guy is, is he's a singer and actor from Japan who, in the 90s,

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.200
um, started doing pairs on TV and actually kind of made it popular again.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:55.200
And so we've got a clip of him, because this guy, he plays a character called Bucky Tamera.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.200
Now we have to remember that this is radio and the audience can't see what we're playing.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.200
So here you can see a war blind, and it's on a giant monitor here, but we kind of have to do the best we can to make this radio friendly segment, so you might have to explain what's going on.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:13.200
Okay, well basically, the scene starts off, it's kind of hanging by a couple windows, and you see what looks like kind of a dance class.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.200
They have people doing pare pares and stuff like that.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:27.200
So what I'm going to do is I'm starting out, they have a class that actually shows these people with, uh, almost looks like springs on their arms that actually, you know, kind of like those muscle springs to, uh, shrinking arms.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.200
I don't like buns or steel, that sort of thing.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.200
Yeah, that kind of thing.

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.700
Anyways, um, let's just start off with them, and do this, and I'll kind of, uh, narrate this as it's going along.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.700
So here we go.

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.700
And, you have to spin it.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.200
And we need the volume.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:53.200
Okay, so it basically seems to get faster and faster, kind of seeing what's going on here, in a ridiculous fashion.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.400
This is useful.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.600
Yes, it's Japanese 2-piece ball.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:00.400
And it springs your brain dramatically.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.400
It can be as if you must do it.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.800
And now enters Bucky.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.000
This game song is a matter of fact.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.200
And I'm showing a statue of him, a box of him.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.600
And out he comes.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:31.600
With iron power duster, with Mr. White everywhere it stops, and now he's going to do a password, turn the gear.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.600
Which I like that I like it so I think it's awesome.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
Now, who's this guy? I don't know what happened.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.600
Here he goes. Oh yeah.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600
It's a type of party.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.600
It's a type of party.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600
That's the one. He's my idol.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600
Yeah, how come he looks cool and neat after an hour and a half?

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.600
I'm the only person he knows how cool he is.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:01.600
No, no, I think I figured it out.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.600
Check it out. It is cool because it has fifty-five Asian women behind it.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.600
That's fun.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.600
Anyways, this is pretty much the normal part of the video.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Him doing the three pees.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.600
He's just got a lot of style. He just is very cool.

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.600
Squash!

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.600
And now it's just really good to him.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.600
It's doing him perfecting his technique.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600
His end pose as you might say.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
Now he's doing it again.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.600
It's a Kung Fu Hara Hara movie.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600
And there's like lasers.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.600
And he's poking...he's poking past lasers.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.600
He's got people cramming him down his arms and stuff.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.600
He looks like Dax right there.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.600
And now he's going to do the traditional Kung Fu thing with the tanto and the ritat.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.600
And blue channeled.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600
And he's still dancing.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.600
In the classroom I like to whip up a disco like that when we're out of nowhere.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:15.600
And now as we're stopping, he's ripping off his shirt and under his shirt he's got a prank.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.600
They're putting the metal things on him.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
And they're taking his pranks off.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.600
They're taking them off.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:29.600
And now he summons for his assistant, some hot aging shit, and here he goes.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.600
Oh, and his final move. And this dress comes off.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.600
And everyone chews because it's so stupid.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.600
All the Asian women cheer because they have to see a panty shot right there. Marilyn Monroe and all the Marilyn Monroe.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.600
Alright. Let's do one more question. Any more of this crap?

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.600
Um, yeah, worst radio ever, guys. The worst radio.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.600
Okay.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.600
I don't know. We're being experimental, banner, so let's give our own answer and get our few devices up in the air.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
Maybe we can put some, uh, still images on.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.600
One that I later made.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.600
Yeah, you can rip some of this, like, and then put this on the side.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.600
Oh, definitely. You know, I mean, what is this?

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:20.600
And now we are going to have the screen inside of a club and there is some J-Pop singer who I have no idea who it is.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.600
And the screen appears to be some sort of cover as it heats you up.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:36.600
And he comes out doing his night of fire bit.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:53.600
And there's the assistant raising all his face, kind of like Phantom of the Opera, or Phantom of the Para-para.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.600
Phantom of the Para, guys.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:06.600
And he loves their micro-friends right here for no apparent reason. I don't know why.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.600
And then he walks away.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.600
So then he's gonna...

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.600
He's gonna pose and the camera's pretty.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600
And he's doing another turn.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600
Okay. One more here.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:36.600
I got a song right here, it is called Dancy Miro, it's a Japanese cover of U2Up.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.600
Interesting, very interesting.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.600
Ok, and if you want to comment on what horrible radio this makes, you can join our chatroom,

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:52.600
it's Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.APEX.ORG, which you can put right into your MIRC server.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.600
Oh, this is a pretty recording. That was the old people, wasn't it?

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.600
This is pretty recording.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.600
Old people are funny. Let's see what this is.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600
There he is.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.600
This is great. You're going to love this one.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.600
And there's old people playing troté.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.600
And there's a guy in a coat that you can't see his face. See?

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.600
And that's a Smith's trademark whistle there.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.460
typing sounds

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.920
He is fine, I'mall Sr oranges

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.160
I'll get out of here while I err

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.020
Buy some of that

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:25.140
It's spirit

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.120
cross

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.380
And all of the sudden the explorer becomes

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.500
He's468 in the yard

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.820
And he's filling all the fire

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.320
again

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:50.320
And he's saying people aren't dancing, and they're staring at him like a nut.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.320
And the old guy recognizes him as Bucky.

01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:06.320
And so he's going to put in a tape that the old people can dance to.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.120
Oh, I see, because all people don't listen to E.V.E.'s tunes.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.320
It's the...

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.720
...Might of Fire uppers version.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:17.920
Oh, wow!

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920
It's a child!

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.420
Wow!

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.720
Nothing is more funny than watching a bunch of old people carry a toy.

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:39.720
Now the people on the penis golf plan, this is what they're going to look like in 50 years.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.720
This is the penis golf plan in 50 years.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.720
And it's senior night on fire!

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:52.720
Alright everybody give a big hand for Matt and his crappy parody series.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:54.720
I said hello!

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.720
We're getting a comment saying this is sad.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:11.720
All right, that about sums it up. I hope that helps. We're going to go ahead and take one more quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap it all up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:54.000
Don't mind what you say, baby Don't mind what you say, baby

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Open up, what are you doing?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Let's dig in!

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Oh

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I want it all

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Let me hear you say

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I want it all

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Is that what you call that?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I want it all

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Let me hear you say

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I want it all

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I want it all

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
You need to bring the beat back

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Oh

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
We often wonder how some of those bimani songs are chosen.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder!

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
We think we figured it out. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, just about at the end of our second show.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I am your host, Rock Roberts. You might know me as Skye.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers is not here this week because she's at Anime Expo.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So fill me in and see lovely Irene the Rice Princess.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And no wedding.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And of course we also have in studio many, many guests.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
And I'd like to thank all you guys for coming this week.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
As you did last week, we've got Matt, we've got Paul, we've got Brad, we've got Bradley

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
who doesn't say anything but he gives moral support.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.140
And the other room we got going on and Dave is coming in the room right now.

01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:02.480
Um, I guess I thought I'd ask you guys at the end of the show, but I really should ask you guys at the beginning of the show, how was your week?

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:08.880
And, any, anything exciting going this week? Or, anything you want to talk about openly on the radio?

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.880
I work out the parking area.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.880
Parking? Freakin' Roseville and sun splash parking.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.480
Their whole parking lot was full.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.480
Parking across the street was full.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.400
If you wanted to get through the sun splash, you would try to run a parking lot fast and narrow like I did.

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.400
Or you go park across the street at the hotel, which probably also was full.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.400
Wow.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.400
What was something going on there today?

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.400
Yeah, it's called the water sky.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.400
There's a drawback with having a big, you know, nice park like us.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.400
And since we have a water park, it's always busy.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.400
You can't find parking spaces during the, you know, summertime.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:45.400
And there's going to be tons of people in their swimsuits dripping water all over the pads.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.400
They have tons of hot chicks in between these halls.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.400
I don't go there to look at hot chicks. I go there to play DVR.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:57.400
I can go online and look up Asian porn if I want to see how shit I don't need to go.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.400
Shush! You do it too!

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.400
Not for you!

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.400
My old nail school was really involved by then.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:09.400
I knew it was me, but Judy, I found a beauty in it.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.400
What about it?

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.400
It was an apron!

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:17.400
Oh, you got a secret, man.

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.400
I need to do a TV show.

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.400
I know right? Nobody listens to the show. It's okay.

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.400
I know. I don't get arrested.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.400
Look right there! You're all listeners. What do you know?

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400
Um.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.400
Oh yeah. Oh yeah the police are listening. What do you know?

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.400
I had time off work this week thank god.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.400
Um and I basically spent my time

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.400
sitting at home playing old school video games

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.400
because I discovered that

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.400
my greatest use for the Dreamcast

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.400
is to burn old Nintendo games

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:45.400
and display them on the Dreamcast.

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.400
I don't think we did this ever again.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.400
Not like that!

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.400
We're going on a sea-watch island.

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.400
Arrrrr!

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:50.400
I don't know why I'm here.

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.400
I don't know why.

01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:52.400
I know why.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.400
We...just...I'm already around here.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400
Sorry.

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.400
Shut up!

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.400
Whoever.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.400
I know.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400
I know.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.400
I know.

01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:00.400
I know.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.400
My doggy caught a mix.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:02.400
Yeah!

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.400
I know!

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.400
I know!

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.400
Yes!

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400
And I discovered...I rediscovered my life as a guardian legend.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:07.400
The old 8-bit Nintendo game which was half shooter, half legend of Zelda.

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.400
Oh yeah.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:09.400
I love that game so much.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.400
If they ever made a sequel to the guardian legend I think I'd quit the game.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:14.400
I love that game so much. If you ever made a sequel to The Guardian Watch, you might think I've quit the game.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400
Yeah!

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:17.400
Are you too busy playing The Guardian Watch?

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.400
Excuse me, I came back. I've quit the game.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.400
What old school video game would have to come back for you guys to quit the game?

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.400
For me?

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.400
Um...at it.

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.400
What good old school game?

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.400
I don't know necessarily what you quit the game at.

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400
What are some good old school games that need to come back?

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.400
Um...

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.400
Oh, you know what's coming after, huh? Oh yeah, we're going to come.

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400
Rhydar! We're making rhydar!

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400
Are we? Yeah!

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.400
What?

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.400
Ninja Diamond!

01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:48.400
Shinobi!

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.400
And of course, we got a common at some point.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:52.400
Wario Kart.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.400
Oh yeah.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.400
Are these the things that Mario's coming into?

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.400
Oh, right on.

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.400
We're going to make a very sweet matter.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:58.400
I don't know.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
And that's always the game that gets me to buy the system.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.400
So once they've made it, they've sold themselves another game too.

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.400
I'm not ready for this.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:09.400
I just got 26th already and it finally comes out.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.400
I'm not ready.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400
I'm going to the old school game.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.400
What's the game two?

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.400
Come on.

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.400
I want me too.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400
That's my two.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400
That's my two.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.400
Yeah.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.400
We can finally shoot that fucking dog.

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.400
Yes, exactly.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.400
The dog's revenge.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:27.400
What the dog?

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:30.400
I want you to play.

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.400
What? There's a Goonies 3?

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400
No, they're making a Goonies 2 movie.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.400
It's actually going to be a good series.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.400
There was a Goonies 2 video game.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.400
The first one was released.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
The Goonies 2 was a video game.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400
I mean, what about Goonies 3?

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.400
I mean, any of them.

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.400
Was there another Cyndi Lauper remix?

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400
Like, how?

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:52.400
No.

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.400
And they did it, like, since we were here that night.

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.400
You know, I don't know.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.400
All graphic, and then they did a challenge.

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:04.400
I can show you why she has a little like, circle trail following behind them, but it's really nice to spend time with them.

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.400
Baby? Baby, you've got Crossy Road! Crossy Road?

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.400
I know you all seem to be a really great drug policy agent.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.400
Oh, for what?

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400
That will never, ever happen.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:23.400
Well, you know, they're actually, uh, I know they have written, uh, the Japan stuff, but they're actually making a lot of action.

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.400
Definitely, really.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.920
If there's a Dragon Ball V game, every level, we just go over the last level for like, 3 paths.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:38.160
There's like one little bit where you like jump on a square, and then it would just like, reach half a level off level, and then on the next episode of...

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.040
How about Quirks, the video game? Do they have that yet?

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.400
No, but that'd be awesome!

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.560
That would be awesome, but what would you do if you just...

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.600
You wouldn't do it!

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:46.320
You're customers!

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.280
It's like, it's a quiz!

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.280
It's a quiz! Are you supposed to be here today?

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.280
Yes, of course not.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.920
I knew it that time! In the bathroom!

01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.460
Uh, did you learn some form?

01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:58.460
Um...no?

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.460
Is that sort of the game thing?

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:02.460
No...are you sure?

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.460
Yeah!

01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.460
We're just hoping you guys will see us later.

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:08.460
Rooftop hockey is the ultimate sports game!

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.460
Quirks presents Rooftop Hockey on the Xbox!

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.460
The ultimate sports game!

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460
That would be cool!

01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:15.460
Go ahead and pass us, you...you suck!

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.460
Do you have any balls down there?

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.460
You're the biggest kid! Get over here!

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:26.460
I don't know. Who says we haven't done Mamamani for two hours? Come on.

01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.460
You know, I'm a person. Give me an end.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:29.460
That is a cool game.

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.460
That is a freaking awesome game.

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.460
Baby. Baby.

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:37.460
Baby makes a good sequel to Blaster Master.

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:42.460
That's what I, oh I'm just ignoring all those other copies of Blaster Master that they've done since.

01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.460
The first one.

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.460
The first one is this. The first one is this.

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.460
And you know what?

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:51.460
Last time I saw, last time I saw you, I thought you were going to have some at that.

01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.460
Your HPT is so good.

01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.460
Yeah!

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.460
Okay, well.

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.460
Ooh, I have commando and leatherback.

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.460
Man, that'd be pretty cool.

01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:09.460
I mean, they have one in Game Boy, but, yeah.

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.460
At least I don't know, just, you know, that'd be cool.

01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.460
Or, some other, you know, game system.

01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.460
Yeah, they do!

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:17.160
The guy has legs!

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:53.160
I thought I would also bring up before the show is over, I'm going to get to pay five more dollars a month to keep this station running

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:59.160
because of the carp, royalty, well they're not carp, but the royalty rates that were passed this week by, I don't know, some judge

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:07.160
and I'm horribly misinformed on what's going on, but basically, one story short of it, internet radio is now going to have to pay seven cents

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:11.160
for every thousand listeners that are listening to this song.

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.160
Now not that this station should have much of a problem because they don't have many listeners,

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:21.160
But, um, unfortunately our host, Y365, decided to do a blanket fee for everybody.

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.160
So everybody's going to have to pay five bucks.

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.160
Which, you know, is a cool way to do it.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.160
Y365 is very good. It's even got the station going on and everything.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.160
I can't really knock them because they do provide a really good service.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.160
Because this thing would never be able to run on a chat chat.

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.160
But, um, if you do think this sucks, I would visit saveinternetradio.org

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.160
and have a read there on what's going on with internet radio.

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.160
Because if over the air radio stations aren't having to pay these kind of fees, why are we?

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:47.160
I guess is quite odd going on.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.160
Save Internet Radio says.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:50.160
So saveinternetradio.org.

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:53.160
Let my PPL go.

01:57:53.160 --> 01:58:12.160
Well we could pay for a week of pay for last show and this show will come by...anyway.

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:18.160
While we figure that out, do listen in next week.

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:23.760
Uh, Jamie's got the week off again, but we'll have, uh, I mean, or somebody will be, yeah, two or one.

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:24.260
I'll be here.

01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:24.760
Ah!

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.360
We're not supposed to disclose, you know, we'll have fun!

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.560
We don't want to ever do a video.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.060
Is anybody else gonna be here next week?

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:32.860
I'll be here.

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.260
Bradley's going in, and I said, you know what, though?

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.660
We, we appreciate having you here, Bradley.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.160
The listeners ain't even gonna notice, cause you never say anything.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:40.060
Oh my god.

01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:42.360
Like you said, it's moral support.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:43.060
Moral support.

01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:47.060
Glen will be here next week because he's going off to school, so he won't be here.

01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:51.060
I will be here definitely. Alright, sounds good.

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:56.060
I will see you all next week then. Thank you for listening everybody. Have a good night.

01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:57.060
Good night!

01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.060
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.700
Orange Lounge Radio is an orange lau-
