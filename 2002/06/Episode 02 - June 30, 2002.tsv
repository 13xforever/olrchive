1779	4401	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4981	7883	Our live talk program begins now.
12627	14769	Orange Lounge Radio
33708	34489	Thank you for watching!
64291	66092	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66192	66552	I hate it.
66672	67333	I'm working on it.
67393	68013	I'm working on it.
68093	69213	I'm working on it.
69413	71094	I'm working on it.
89682	99245	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
99505	104327	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
104667	107488	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skye.
107788	110969	With me as always is my lovely co-host Jamie Somers, a.k.a.
111249	113590	DarkSakura, but not this weekend.
113770	118812	Jamie has decided to sit down a bit early to head off to the big Anime Expo convention in Southern California.
119432	121273	But we have a substitute teacher for you tonight.
121313	122914	Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene.
122954	124294	Hello to the lovely Irene.
124314	125094	Thank you very much.
125214	128076	Or some simply call her the Rice Princess.
128096	132157	This is episode number two for June the 30th of 2002.
132197	135579	We are joined in studio once again by a whole buffet of CD-R personalities.
135599	136399	Say hello everybody.
136419	136579	Hello.
142250	145771	Yeah, we'll be talking to some of them more a bit later, but first a very quick break.
146211	148432	Any other opening thoughts for you?
148552	149632	Oh, great, last break, next break.
149832	152453	Why don't you look at some Pussycats, Anna?
152533	152953	Oh, um, okay.
152993	155613	Well then, but then you can't come up to the show.
155633	156273	Send your boyfriend.
156333	156754	Oh, um, okay.
156814	158494	I want to try the new Triple Taco.
158774	159574	Okay, I will.
159614	160715	Friday's a big summer.
160735	161215	Good morning.
161235	161915	Good morning.
167026	167667	I'll find money.
167747	168948	Actually, I don't have money.
168988	171871	Do you think I'll find something, Christy James?
171951	174314	Okay, Christy James, on the way.
174594	174714	Yay!
174754	176997	Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break.
177037	179800	We'll be talking about all sorts of fun stuff this week.
180100	182062	Another two hours to be filled with the money.
182082	182543	That's amazing.
443326	447428	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
462066	463827	Extreme Babani Radio.
463987	464647	That's us.
464687	466107	Orange Lounge Radio.
466187	467568	That is us.
467588	470089	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the second broadcast.
470129	472990	What are you guys looking up over there on the computer?
473810	475010	Are you being pirates?
476051	476291	Arrgh!
477531	480132	Did you hear about that new pirate movie?
480192	480872	No, I didn't.
480932	481352	Arrgh!
481512	481632	Arrgh!
489409	491075	I always count on you for a funny joke.
492299	494567	Yeah, I'm so glad Jamie chose you this time.
494607	495590	Let's see it for the plate.
496252	503915	Jamie is supposedly joining us in the chat room right now, but she's under the name BrightSakura, so I have to admit I'm a little skeptical.
503935	506797	So I just asked the quiz question to make sure it's really who it is.
506817	510799	So we'll see if she's able to frankly identify herself.
510819	511719	BrightSakura.
511759	517462	Well, I imagine if I were Jamie right now, I'd be in a pretty peppy mood too.
517522	518042	Oh, I'd be like...
521487	523129	Thank you for watching!
541261	544603	Don't go down the street, but I remember some angel sanctuary.
544623	546384	Yes, angel sanctuary, thank you.
546525	547825	And it's wearing all black.
547905	548606	Yes, was it that hat?
548766	549306	I don't know.
549326	552408	This is how much we know about anime here.
552488	554870	Oh, Jamie's going to kill us when she gets back.
555410	556651	Okay, so anyway.
570333	574375	Well, I thought, uh, well, last week we were talking about this whole, uh, Solo 2000 thing.
574395	578658	This is about the only thing in Bomani news that's pretty big right now, because there's no new games coming out, really.
579518	587002	Uh, Solo 2000, the evil, evil machine that it is, getting pulled from bowling alleys and things across the nation.
587022	588023	No, just one so far.
589003	597007	Um, but it's starting to kind of cause this fear and panic amongst other people, like, oh my gosh, are they going to pull our solo machine out of place over the crappy USA Mix, or what's going to happen?
598108	599569	To make things worse this week...
600747	611216	Fox News in San Diego, Channel 6, aired a special little report, and I thought we'd air it for you here on the show, and that's how we can all respond to it live on air.
611256	616521	If you guys want me to pause this, you can comment, just let me know, but let's take a look at this little news story.
616541	622746	This is coming to us, by the way, from BomaniX.com, I'll admit I just ruthlessly stole it from them, but thanks to them providing it for the internet, so here we go.
625802	626102	and so on.
664551	666633	We just want to dance your heart out.
666673	668835	To Bye Bye Baby Balloon?
668955	669315	Oh my gosh.
669355	670176	Hey, hey, hey.
670477	671377	This looks easy.
671598	674760	And more importantly, this looks like everything's fine.
674780	678244	When you're out there and you have the music going on.
678264	682608	When I see this woman up there talking on the screen right now, I'm not thinking about fun.
682628	682948	I don't...
683852	684773	Who is this lady?
684813	687735	Her name is Pamela Cameron, and she's a mom.
688195	688996	Just a mom?
689036	689576	Just a mom.
689596	692418	She's probably the only white lady in San Diego.
692558	694559	I used to live there, I would know.
694620	701444	I've been living for an hour, and I didn't know that there was a corn mine, so one of my kids grew up and stopped looking at me.
701464	705087	There's things in the music, and it's a neat thing for kids.
705107	705547	It's neat.
705567	708229	Dance dance revolution is neat.
708369	711011	I thought it was pretty fun, I don't know, but it is neat.
715566	725532	I was really quite alarmed because you're there and there's, um... I was really quite alarmed, it was a shock.
725572	726753	Oh, it's a nurse and pills.
726773	727573	Oh, no, thank you.
727653	734217	Pills all over the world, and needles, and... Oh, that's my dog.
734277	737759	Images you just may not want your kids to be seeing.
737919	740561	I'll keep it with the dog for now.
740621	741121	Thank you.
746488	747911	This is a heroin-dealing nerd.
759557	761018	It's a man, baby, yeah.
791548	792669	You know what's funny?
817393	820877	All of them show some stuff, but then they replace it with a solo machine.
821238	829267	Like, they show the picture of Max at the top, and at the beginning when they're explaining it, they're showing, like, somewhere over the rainbow and bye-bye these balloons.
829628	835175	But then when they show them shows, it's on a solo machine, and then they go back to the Max.
841866	842787	Thank you for watching!
860771	862912	I believe this is the owner of the bowling alley.
862932	866532	But these images are still on some local dance machine.
866592	869813	I never noticed that until someone mentioned it to me.
869833	872294	I never know that until someone mentioned it to me.
872394	877575	It seems like the guy who just kind of sits there in the back of the bowling alley and just like spaces.
894142	902347	Hey listen, we've got too many things out there that we really need to change and I don't want the country or the families to see that.
902387	905289	See, there's too many things out there to change.
905309	910833	So, let's start with those evil dancing machines.
911113	912534	I know.
912694	917157	In images that some people say should have never been here in the first place.
923283	925945	So what do you guys think of that, that beautiful little report?
925965	927906	You are making it back into the news media again.
928006	932789	It's pretty cool because, you know, anything that starts controversy is obviously going to become hugely popular.
933249	934370	And, um, the fact is, is that they, they
953232	957075	Yeah, there's nothing to change.
957095	958457	You know?
958657	959758	Listen to yourself.
959778	963861	Hold on, we have to stop the show because Dave wants to play with this slinky that's sitting on the desk here.
963881	965022	So hold on a minute.
965062	965743	There you go, Dave.
966083	966283	Enjoy.
966323	967504	Alright, I'm sorry.
967524	968725	You had a lot of fun.
968745	980915	Yeah, and I, you know, they should put a warning on DVD that says, if you play this, you're gonna, you know, evoke the Dark Lord Satan and he's gonna come and eat your children and stuff because he's a hero.
980975	981636	I know, like,
982757	991846	Seriously, I think there are more people out there doing worse things than playing DDR, which is good for your health, and there's so many benefits to it.
991926	995330	I'm not going to obviously list them, because everyone knows that plays.
995350	1006301	Well, that's actually the first time really I've seen those images that they've been referring about on the article and all that stuff, like these evil images of the nurse riding on a...
1007102	1009102	You know, why don't you monitor what your children are doing?
1009122	1019665	You know, if you don't like them playing it, don't let them play, but don't have them take it Why would you leave your kids with some guy in the bowling alley who looks like that guy who's kind of sitting in the back, muck, muck, muck all day long?
1019705	1022685	Yeah, and you know you can do worse things than the freaking DJ Ranma S
1034305	1035845	I just like to feel.
1035865	1045708	You think we're going to be seeing a lot more of these kind of new stories throughout the week?
1046608	1052570	I don't know.
1053150	1053370	Yeah.
1053510	1053690	There.
1053790	1055930	Anyway.
1056150	1057131	Yeah, so.
1057151	1059931	All those films look exactly like the ones from Dr. Mario.
1059971	1061332	You're absolutely right.
1061452	1061892	I had a point.
1061952	1062792	I don't remember that up
1063519	1070103	I think because Dr. Mario wasn't dressed provocatively, you know, wearing a cute little bikini outfit, you know, and straddling a syringe, you know.
1070463	1075046	Do you think if Dr. Mario had been like Dr. Princess Peach, it might have been a different issue?
1075126	1078428	And she was like, you know, straddling the little viruses and things like that?
1078448	1079148	Maybe, who knows?
1094469	1096310	I'm on a bikini, I'd kill myself.
1096330	1097010	That's pretty gross.
1097731	1099331	But yeah, I don't know.
1099351	1104234	That's probably just because it's a female thing that you don't see on TV every day or anything.
1104254	1108636	You know, some girl has... Well, maybe you are going to see it on TV every day.
1108676	1110637	Are you just flipping through the news stations?
1110797	1111057	No, no.
1111117	1114058	I mean, like, just women in general get really glad, you know.
1114078	1117400	Open up the newspaper and look at the laundry section, you know, and then whack off to it, too.
1117540	1119821	It's called the Almost Wild On Special Life.
1119861	1120181	I know!
1124591	1126672	Behind the Playboy Mansion, and MTV!
1126792	1127933	All of it!
1128073	1131074	Britney Spears!
1132475	1134315	I know, guys!
1135416	1148542	So, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, leave that comment you want to give on this, go ahead and join irc.apes.org, and then the channel is Orange Lounge, and hopefully within the next week we will have a little online...
1150379	1150919	and so on.
1176956	1178477	Also, comedy, it's a nurse.
1178557	1180158	It's giving props to doctors.
1180598	1182579	It's raising medical awareness.
1182619	1184359	Be your doctor.
1184399	1186760	Get your checkups right early, which I don't do.
1186780	1188281	So I'm not playing enough Solo 2000.
1188361	1190402	I haven't been to the doctor in three years.
1192183	1193563	Hello, she's like my foster.
1193623	1194103	I'm bad.
1194584	1195704	I'm so bad.
1196905	1197245	Shut up.
1201477	1205682	Alright, we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back with many, many FUs of the week.
1205702	1208606	Now that Jamie's gone this week, it seems like everybody has their own FU of the week.
1208666	1212190	And also, Paul will be giving us his Drama Drama Revolution wrap-up.
1212230	1214393	So stay tuned, we'll be right back in about three minutes.
1214433	1216776	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
1394162	1395103	DarkSakura.com
1538931	1540692	Bitch, get a new song.
1541292	1543894	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
1544194	1546836	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
1547056	1549297	For this June 30th.
1549337	1552579	And Brad is back in the house and he has brought Krispy Kremes with him.
1553019	1554640	Thank you, Brad.
1554760	1554960	Yay!
1554980	1557762	What flavors do we have here?
1557822	1558362	Ooh, yummy.
1558442	1561644	I want one of those American... I fell for a bite.
1562004	1562965	I should be on a diet.
1563245	1565827	Although I did take back red meat this week.
1565887	1566307	I decided...
1567325	1567966	It was pointless.
1568186	1569287	Red meat's delicious.
1569347	1571930	Yeah, red meat's too good for me to be doing it.
1572130	1574112	And you know what I noticed today?
1574172	1575153	I went to Mongolian barbecue today.
1575253	1581199	And I was only able to eat, I put beef in it because I figured as long as I'm back on red meat, let's go overboard with it.
1581760	1584242	And I was only able to eat like a third of the bowl.
1584322	1587746	Whereas if I usually get like chicken or anything else, I eat the whole damn thing.
1588667	1590609	That's what happens with girls and stuff.
1591525	1592246	Thank you for watching!
1608954	1611956	Jamie Summers is on vacation this week and next week.
1611976	1613176	She's going off to Anime Expo.
1613196	1615717	But she has a little segment she does every week.
1615777	1617118	Or at least she did it last week.
1617198	1618819	And she says she's going to be doing it every week.
1618839	1620760	So I guess we'll see what she does next.
1620780	1621400	Called Jamie's F.U.
1621520	1622040	of the Week.
1622221	1625302	And since she's not here tonight, I'm going to film my own little F.U.
1625342	1626082	here of the week.
1629084	1630705	My F.U.
1630725	1631145	of the Week.
1632826	1635107	People who can't follow the freaking token law.
1636587	1637288	I hate it.
1638274	1638975	Thanks for watching!
1670763	1671123	I think so.
1671244	1674786	Um, like this person just had no concept of a line.
1674826	1678389	It was just kind of like, oh, put your token on the machine and that means you can go next.
1678409	1683814	You know, I didn't even realize people would put all their tokens on the machine.
1683974	1685395	I'm like, okay, you can go on the machine.
1685455	1687356	Oh, then you put like four tokens on the machine.
1687416	1689018	Oh, this means I'm going to play for you.
1700466	1703628	And when they do that, I flip them off and say, well, you know, this means fuck you.
1703648	1704188	Fuck off.
1704308	1705428	I'm going to play now.
1706689	1709710	You know what I hate about the token line also is trying to explain it to parents.
1710631	1713052	Because sometimes parents just don't understand.
1713092	1713812	Okay, well.
1713852	1714112	Carameld.
1714792	1715453	Yeah, boo!
1715493	1723136	So someone had to sit the dad down and explain to him over like 15 minutes how the coin line worked.
1723316	1724537	And then they shook hands afterwards.
1724797	1726218	Did they have to like draw out a map?
1730902	1732583	What do you guys think about the coin line?
1733103	1736184	Do you think it's an effective way to keep track?
1736304	1737864	I mean, we all play DDR regularly.
1737884	1739985	We all happen to go to the same place.
1740005	1745367	We all have waited in token line while other people here are waiting in the line.
1745387	1746567	Do you think it works, or what?
1746627	1748548	Well, what other kind of methods do we have?
1758200	1760222	It works when you have, like, a few people playing.
1760242	1769209	When you've got, like, eight people waiting to play, and there's just so many people that you can't even remember, you know, which one's yours or when you're going up because there's so many on there.
1770010	1773933	I think once it gets over, like, four people, then you need to find another way.
1773953	1779918	Well, I just think that it's easy to just have a little rack on the side of the screen that they put on some video game teams.
1779978	1784402	And that's like a non-falsing game room that I wouldn't say, except for the slots one through eight, right?
1789483	1800352	You know what bugs me about that system sometimes, though, is that Stockton Golf Land, a local system, has that system, too, where they have the slots that say 1 through 8, and you put your coin up there so you remember what number you're in.
1800673	1810381	But sometimes people go up there, they take their coin out of number 1, and then they move all the other coins over one space, which I can see the point of that if all the coins didn't look the same.
1810401	1815986	The thing is that it's very confusing because you don't know what to do.
1817299	1820721	I want to buy it as a triple chocolate, so you can't touch that.
1820761	1825383	Sometimes it sucks at golfing.
1825403	1826684	Sometimes it sucks at golf.
1826704	1828124	Sometimes it sucks at golf, I know.
1828144	1831446	You'll put your coin up, you know, maybe number three.
1831546	1832867	And then you get shot six times.
1832887	1834468	Because it sucks at golfing.
1835068	1837169	And then you'll be bleeding to death on the pad.
1837189	1838930	That kind of puts a damper on it.
1845945	1855590	I think Golfland's problem is not gang, well, it is gang members, that's part of the problem, but I would say their four-year-old princesses are a much bigger problem than even at Roseville Golfland.
1855610	1858112	Stockton Golfland has some mean children.
1858532	1862234	I mean, the ones at Roseville Golfland are snotty children, but the ones at Stockton Golfland are mean.
1862254	1865916	They'll, like, step on your feet, they'll throw all the coins off the machine.
1865936	1872320	They're the type that, when you play Monopoly, you know, you're going around, and if they lose the game, they just throw everything up in the air and go, I quit.
1872360	1873480	You lose, you suck.
1873520	1874581	What was I going to say?
1875359	1878040	What about other methods other than the token life?
1878060	1878561	There's the list.
1878581	1878961	The list.
1878981	1880381	How does the list work?
1880401	1882683	You write your name.
1882763	1883903	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1883923	1884383	Does it work?
1884443	1885404	Is it good?
1885504	1887365	It depends on how many people.
1887705	1891927	It's pretty pointless if you only have, you know, a handful of people.
1899939	1905061	I remember we used to do that at Roseville Golf Land when we got the 4th Mix machine and we had a sign-up sheet going on there.
1905081	1907623	But then it just kind of stopped.
1907643	1910224	Because, you know, you can work with a group of people.
1910244	1910504	Mm-hmm.
1910524	1910664	Yep.
1923517	1928239	But when there are people that just want to go up and play, you know, they don't know what they're doing.
1928259	1933562	They don't know anything about any kind of coin line or, you know, list that they have to put their name on.
1933602	1935903	They won't think it's fair and they'll complain about it.
1936083	1944987	But I would say a sign-up sheet is easier to show somebody like, hey, we've got a system going on here than trying to explain why 10 coins are all up on the machine right now.
1945467	1949389	People don't, parents, I don't know, or people who don't play PDR in an arcade scenario, they just go,
1953115	1955176	Make your name below if you'd like to get in line to play.
1955196	1956597	Well, maybe they just shouldn't play video.
1957178	1958219	Maybe they should stay home.
1958379	1960400	Maybe they shouldn't wake up in the morning.
1960460	1960880	Amen!
1960900	1963062	They shouldn't shoot themselves.
1963142	1966204	Oh, sorry, I'm not getting all extreme.
1966224	1970527	Stupid people aren't half as stupid, so what do you expect?
1970547	1972868	Stupid people deserve to play USA Next.
1972928	1974570	Exactly, that's what usually happens.
1974590	1975410	They play USA Next.
1975971	1979493	What they should do is establish some sort of bullying system.
1980527	1980987	and so on.
2003761	2005042	I bet people can get in line.
2005082	2005422	Oh, sure.
2005462	2008024	Because, I mean, look at the VideoMax shoe upgrade.
2008084	2009965	How fast does that make its money back?
2010086	2013228	I bet it's paid for itself within the first two weeks.
2013428	2013588	Sure.
2013608	2015369	This is off a black market, I'm sure.
2015389	2015769	Hey, hey, hey.
2015789	2016250	Is it worth it?
2022479	2028663	I think a lot of it is the arcade really doesn't give a shit who goes when as long as there's constantly quarters being put in the machine.
2028723	2032886	It's being suggested in the chat room that everybody just be given their own machine.
2032926	2033927	Give us a solo machine.
2050720	2052422	We'll take all the solo machines you're taking away.
2052462	2054543	Actually, they can keep their solo machines.
2054603	2057106	I played the solo bass machine down at Lake Bowl.
2057126	2060829	Solo bass is by far the worst DR mix they ever made.
2060849	2063131	But solo 2000s, solo 2000s is a little better.
2063171	2065533	At least it has like twice as many songs.
2066313	2067274	It's got some non-stops.
2067294	2069236	You can change the difficult board panel.
2069316	2071057	Is solo bass the one that was that...
2079045	2080025	Okay, yeah, we were long ago.
2080125	2080985	It's not there anymore, though.
2081005	2081625	We have, like, a flat.
2081645	2083326	That one was not bad.
2083546	2085246	You know what the worst one for me is?
2085326	2085606	What?
2085666	2085926	I think 1.5.
2085966	2086406	But whatever.
2086486	2090087	Anything 1.5 or 4, if there is ever 1.5 or 4.
2090127	2092847	Yeah, but we haven't gotten the retro value at this point.
2092867	2097108	You know, whenever somebody plays Boom Boom Dollar, it's like, oh, you're being retro.
2097128	2099229	You're going to lose a dollar.
2099269	2103909	But if somebody's playing, if somebody's playing, I don't know, what was the solo bass song again?
2108608	2111391	I don't even know what songs are on that machine.
2111691	2117756	Paranoia, Paranoia Evolution, Superstar, Victoria, Bickle Tropical.
2117976	2120999	When somebody gets Bickle Tropical, they just go, what is that?
2121079	2122420	I don't know.
2123160	2125743	I just don't like how it's always six down.
2125763	2127044	I don't want to play four down.
2127244	2127904	I hate six down.
2127924	2128585	That's another thing.
2128605	2130146	So what's it out and what you pick?
2130526	2131988	Four down, six down, or three down.
2132028	2133189	You know what I'm saying?
2136883	2139285	I'm really morally corrupt, so I don't give a shit.
2139305	2139986	Give me the phone.
2140126	2141987	I don't, you know, I don't care.
2142007	2146371	But, yeah, hey, right, Irene, she writes syringes in her spare time.
2146491	2148233	Exactly, you know.
2148293	2150215	I own a ranch where you can write a syringe.
2150575	2151976	Yeah, um, anyway.
2153477	2160684	Anyway, yeah, so, that's kind of one of the benefits of those, is that, like, you can choose between six and four and three, right?
2160764	2161705	You can do three.
2162839	2164400	I think that three is what, up, left, and right?
2164480	2165841	And you can also use the upper left and the upper.
2165881	2167041	Down and the upper left and right.
2167061	2168962	Down and the upper left and right.
2168982	2170143	Down and the upper left and right.
2170163	2171244	Down and the upper left and right.
2171264	2172444	Down and the upper left and right.
2172464	2173785	Down and the upper left and right.
2173805	2176026	Down and the upper left and right.
2176046	2178808	Down and the upper left and right.
2184982	2187104	Combined Pump It Up in DDR, and that's that.
2187584	2188344	Oh, Nine Metal, okay.
2188424	2192767	Isn't that the classic person's first post on most DDR bulletin boards, though?
2192827	2195609	It's like, shouldn't they make a Nine Metal DDR?
2195629	2202993	You think Konami's just waiting to do this, or you think it's not practical for a Nine Metal DDR, or what?
2203094	2206756	How is that not practical?
2207421	2217468	That's a lot of stuff to be watching, although, granted, if you can do 2DX, which is 8 things you have to watch, or Keyboard Mania, which is what, like 26, 52 if you're playing doubles, things you have to watch.
2217488	2218449	You only have 2 feet, and not 10 feet.
2218529	2219429	I don't know.
2219450	2219810	I don't know.
2219830	2220570	It'd be worth a try.
2220971	2224513	It'd be fun, but I don't think it's something they can actually run.
2231070	2234311	That's why Technomotion is just taken off, because it's super fun.
2234411	2237413	Yeah, that's the Korean one.
2237433	2240234	Four panel, five panel, or eight panel, unfortunately.
2240254	2242395	There's no nine panel in my mouth.
2242415	2246156	But yeah, it's not like everybody, hey, everybody's doing Technomotion.
2246197	2247017	Here's my Technomotion.
2247137	2252299	If you can't see, I'm sticking my finger in my mouth.
2259807	2264028	So back to the coin line, you guys think it's effective for now?
2264088	2265568	You don't know any better alternatives?
2265628	2269209	How can we better educate everybody on the coin line?
2269229	2272889	I bet there might be people listening to this show right now.
2272909	2273690	Very practical, thank you.
2273790	2276830	Oh, you mean like, tell them how can you...
2287049	2288450	It's like, uh-uh, they don't care.
2288470	2288891	They don't care.
2288911	2290852	They just want to give them their money.
2315936	2317405	Well, you know, one can't say...
2322023	2324365	Well, you know, there's a nerd fucking a syringe on here.
2324405	2326646	Do you really want your kid to play?
2326666	2327947	No, I'll play for him.
2327967	2336773	Well, actually, you know, I think that, golf fans especially, do they really want those angry people either yelling at the players or yelling at them?
2336813	2339695	They just say, oh, fuck the players, let them yell at them.
2340175	2341656	So, hey, good point.
2341756	2346920	I think there's a little more to that, because if people are yelling at the players, the players are obviously, you know,
2351838	2352418	It doesn't matter.
2352438	2354159	They're always going to get complaints.
2354239	2354979	It doesn't matter.
2355079	2357360	It's just a matter of who's going to complain.
2357460	2360361	So, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
2360381	2363502	Yeah, I mean, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
2364402	2368923	From my experience, either they won't do it or they'll take a long time to do it.
2369043	2369824	So, I don't know.
2369844	2373765	But, I mean, I think this is where stuff has been done.
2373825	2374685	But, I don't know.
2374805	2378406	As far as the whole coin line, it's more of an implied thing that
2381765	2386867	you know, set rules that anyone has to follow according to mine you know, they can just say fuck off, I'm gonna play right now
2387806	2391049	I don't know about those people who just jump off coins and leave.
2391110	2397055	Now that's something else that bothers me that I see, and this happens at the really, really crowded places.
2397075	2401099	Say, an arcade in the Bay Area is the very first place to be a brand new machine.
2401619	2403081	Fifty coins up on the damn machine.
2403101	2404822	You have no idea who's going when.
2404863	2412550	Somebody will just put their coin up there, they'll leave, they'll go play some better games for an hour or whatever, then they'll come back and go, oh, by the way, it's my turn.
2415471	2415851	I don't know.
2415871	2420254	Do you think that if somebody puts a coin up, they should be obligated to wait there until it's their turn?
2420414	2423916	It's like they're paying their dues, they should wait there to go?
2423956	2425697	I don't want to play it that badly.
2425717	2426357	Not necessarily.
2426417	2433721	I always end up leaving coins on the machine, and I'll just say, okay, there's two people in front of me, that's enough time to play one game fair, fair, and come back and watch.
2434081	2438703	You know, I kind of estimate how much, you know, how many people are going to be in front of me, and then I'll go back.
2439044	2442846	What I use when I put my coin up, go play something else, come back, there's no coins on the machine.
2442886	2443366	What do y'all do?
2444762	2445842	and that will be his pocket.
2445942	2460645	Like, if there's ten coins up on the machine, like three or four weeks ago, and I was exalting all these people on the boards, the Sack of Money boards, we're talking about, God, I hate how people just put their coins up and then leave and come back after an hour.
2460665	2464366	They go, oh, it's my turn, because even though they've turned ass about five times.
2464766	2472908	So what I do is I put my coin up, count how many are before, and as soon as that person's done playing, I yell out through the whole arcade, I'm next in five people!
2473689	2475070	No one takes my turn.
2475430	2478091	And then so everyone knows just like when my turn is.
2478111	2478992	And it's worked every time.
2479012	2482294	That's why, that's kind of similar to what I try to do when I get in the coin mine.
2482394	2486216	If I put my coin up, I go, okay, who is the last person to put their coin up?
2486276	2488497	I'm going after that person, the hell with the rescue.
2488597	2493280	Although, I almost got killed by a little kid, a little, I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me.
2493320	2493800	It's fucking awful.
2493840	2496021	And when I, I got up there and said, I'm playing.
2496081	2501444	Because this person, but they're joking that she starts on a, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2508476	2509417	Thank you for watching!
2534262	2543064	Have you guys heard of any other methods of keeping track in the coin line besides, or I'm sorry, keeping track of when you're trying to exploit the money besides coin lines, finance sheets?
2543684	2545124	Brad has a smart ass comment.
2545224	2547505	I know I punch you in the face.
2547545	2548025	Thank you.
2548045	2548805	Thank you, Brad.
2548845	2550746	How about maturity?
2550786	2552146	How about some maturity?
2552206	2560728	I think that's really the thing that's important here because if somebody else is trying, if, you know, before you're asking, you can say, you know, I know when my turn is.
2560788	2562668	If somebody's wrong, I'm not going to apologize.
2564076	2564756	and so on.
2587396	2589857	Yes, and that's where our emotions start to crash.
2589877	2592338	The times I try to be nice, that's exactly what's happened.
2592398	2594399	And then it's like, okay, why did I bother?
2594439	2595459	Why should I be nice?
2595479	2597100	That's my education by gunpoint.
2597280	2606643	So what they need to do is have just like the customer service desk, that Target and that Deli and stuff, the now serving sign is take a number.
2607384	2615889	I was actually thinking that would be a great system to use in a tournament, actually, because I don't know how many tournaments you guys have been into, the PA portions.
2615909	2617770	We're going to tap and everybody's qualifying.
2617890	2622793	It's like, they'll call the next person, and the next person, Oh, that guy's playing Parapara right now.
2623154	2626215	We've got to go get him when their game's finished.
2626456	2630638	And everybody's standing around there waiting for two minutes.
2633353	2634554	That would be a good idea to use.
2634574	2640878	Use the little pull tabs things, or not necessarily the pull tabs, but have the little counter, and it's like, your number is so-and-so.
2640978	2647522	So when it's about four people before you, you better be waiting by the machine, because you're trying to qualify or you're out.
2647562	2651525	I thought that was a good way to speed up urban snack trends in the future, getting around those mistakes.
2651545	2654367	But do you think that would work in a normal arcade setting?
2654407	2655708	I don't think so.
2655728	2657969	You go through a lot of that stuff.
2658009	2659770	And then who's going to pay for that?
2659850	2662212	And I'm going to have to take five in a row, so I
2674298	2675219	Do I have to?
2675259	2675659	Oh, yeah.
2675699	2682283	So like having those little numbers at Carl's Jr.?
2683704	2685826	Well, what happens to those numbers at Carl's Jr.?
2685846	2686426	They get stolen.
2686446	2695352	How many of those A-hole hecklers, though, are going to just take numbers and go away, though?
2695392	2696413	Eh, let's just put this way.
2696433	2699255	The problem's never going to go away.
2699275	2700356	People are too tempted.
2703138	2704039	Thank you for watching!
2731877	2736079	You know Mom, unless it's our machine, we can't really establish anything.
2736099	2740981	We can try to do a lot of stuff, but you know, it's not our machine.
2741121	2745102	I know we care about it, but we can only do so much.
2745182	2746703	It's not our machine.
2761338	2762399	That's all they care about.
2762419	2768562	They don't care about you and your feelings, and they don't care about if you spend five dollars or five people.
2768662	2769082	Exactly.
2769122	2770122	It's not our machine.
2770563	2774284	We can't, you know, make any kind of fool over itself.
2774925	2778406	Shouldn't our data have to take that extra responsibility when they buy a video machine?
2778787	2779827	What, fix the goddamn thing?
2779847	2780727	Maintain the goddamn thing?
2780788	2781788	Oh, you mean work?
2781868	2783549	No, what are you talking about?
2783589	2785290	I'm talking about the lines.
2785350	2785630	Uh-oh.
2788668	2793409	I think games have had this problem since Street Fighter 2 came out.
2793489	2795210	I guess the token line kind of evolved.
2795230	2797870	They are a family amusement center, correct?
2797950	2800991	So they should be doing something to manage it.
2801091	2803791	I think that falls under the line of customer service.
2803911	2807552	And as usual, most places have poor customer service.
2807692	2813934	And there's nothing you can do about it until somebody either gets killed or gets sued or gets fired.
2813954	2814694	Don't forget about it.
2814714	2815434	I mean, look at this.
2816198	2817920	People don't know how to take turns.
2818240	2819942	I mean, we learn that in kindergarten.
2820122	2823606	How sad is it when we can't take turns?
2824206	2826508	People don't understand the concept of taking turns.
2826949	2827549	That's really sad.
2827569	2830572	Why are these people working for a living?
2830612	2832634	They understand, they just don't want to do it.
2832654	2836939	You know, people fly our planes, you know, serving our government.
2837519	2839201	Running our country.
2843412	2845994	Yeah, I'm not that cool.
2846094	2847815	I don't have that great of a job.
2847855	2849536	Hey, it's just a cross-section of America.
2850077	2851578	Well, cross-section of all you people of America.
2851618	2863386	Alright, anybody else want to say anything on the coin lines, taking turns, things we should have learned in kindergarten, things on that note?
2863446	2866988	And on that note, we're going to take another break.
2867008	2867668	We'll be right back.
2870169	2871011	Thank you for watching!
2955960	2957707	Thank you for watching!
3033993	3034854	Thank you for watching!

3360418	3370522	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a sharpie pin, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
3371442	3375004	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
3375644	3378665	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live.
3380871	3383313	I want to turn the mic over to Mr. Paul, a.k.a.
3383333	3387155	Pauliver, to talk about Drama Drama Revolution.
3387235	3393139	Yes, that would be all of the drama that goes on on the online community, on all the different bulletin boards out there.
3393159	3398162	Paul's volunteered, I guess, every week or even help us out with this.
3398182	3400063	You know, there's a lot of stuff every weekend.
3401846	3403267	There's a lot to enter, so.
3403307	3411655	Well, every week, if there's enough material, material pending, and Paul's attendance to the show, uh, pending or whatever, Paul wants to give a wrap-up.
3412075	3414037	And we're going to call it Drama Drama Revolution.
3414057	3416419	So go for it, Paul.
3416880	3425808	Last time on Sack of Money, Antonio and Meg, and Marikano and my boy, were infuriated by a girl who turned into a giant dragon eating them both.
3429332	3431313	and Nathan McClossett playing Delta Flavor.
3431333	3441219	Then DarkSakura came in, using her mod power, killed them both, and we tried to, you know, steal some order in the whole thing, but it didn't get any greater.
3441259	3446823	And then, on New York Rim, I couldn't read anything with the golden summary, and I got
3464124	3464804	I mean, God.
3465484	3466205	Everyone's just gone.
3466225	3466945	Everyone died, I mean.
3467065	3471005	Any other words you want to wrap up for us?
3492629	3494610	Alright, we'll go on to our revolution.
3494630	3502733	Thank you very much for all your support.
3502893	3503573	Irene has a joke.
3503593	3505494	Alright, we'll cut the joke and then we'll come back.
3505534	3509075	We'll take a quick break and then come back for the top of the hour.
3509695	3510255	Or whatever.
3511556	3512536	Yeah.
3512556	3515637	You want to tell your joke?
3515677	3517658	What do you call a deer that has no eyes?
3518522	3518902	What?
3519303	3520304	No idea.
3520604	3524748	What do you call a kid that has no eyes and no legs?
3524768	3525088	What?
3525448	3526589	Still no idea.
3526670	3527430	Oh, I got loose.
3527590	3528211	All right.
3528331	3528771	Okay, go.
3529192	3529392	Okay.
3529472	3534156	Anyway, we're going to do another song, and we'll be back.
3534196	3534697	Here we go.
3619139	3621540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3641816	3644097	You're very famous in the Bomani community for something, Irene.
3644117	3646697	I don't know if you want me to bring this up on the show, but I think it's funny.
3646717	3649158	You want to tell us about it, what you're famous for in the scene?
3649178	3650578	Yeah, I think maybe you should explain it.
3650598	3652358	You want me to explain it?
3652378	3655399	Well, we had this tournament in Sacramento back in October.
3655419	3658180	We are S.C.A.T., Sacramento's Cosplay Internment.
3658200	3659280	No dirty connotations at all needed.
3659380	3662280	And you happen to be one of our judges from Resale.
3662320	3662380	Yes.
3665361	3667883	We ended up having an equal, I believe, male and female judges.
3667903	3669624	No, we had more female judges than male judges, didn't we?
3669704	3673987	I don't remember, because we had you, we had Iwana Girl, Sharks Girl, and DarkSakura.
3674027	3674847	Yeah, we had four.
3674867	3676368	Jamie was a judge.
3676408	3678070	Jamie was a judge, yes, actually.
3678970	3681131	But you were the infamous judge on Freestyle.
3681152	3681412	Yes, yes.
3683937	3688298	Because you wrote on somebody's card, I would have given it a higher score.
3688338	3689758	What was it you wrote on his card?
3689858	3694839	I believe a higher score would have been given if Mira wasn't being what I wrote.
3694899	3696400	And I gave them a score of 80.
3696800	3697100	Yes.
3697340	3698280	Which is a bad score.
3698300	3700120	Which is a B. You know, what's wrong with a B?
3700160	3700821	You know, but anyway.
3700841	3702561	But you took a lot of heat.
3702601	3704781	Well, you didn't take a lot of heat for this movie.
3704801	3707302	All of Sacramento took a heat for it, but that's okay.
3707382	3709242	And you know why I didn't take a lot of heat?
3709282	3709482	Why?
3709622	3710423	I don't know.
3710483	3711743	I don't know.
3713487	3717031	You know, so, yeah, anyway, I guess I didn't say what I didn't say.
3717451	3718713	Yes, I am, but I like this.
3718813	3721175	Like, I don't care about if people get mad.
3721195	3722497	Well, what do you want to know?
3734386	3740448	or what do you have to say to the people that are like, what the hell are you thinking is a mirror thing and why would you give it a lower score?
3740548	3741909	And of course you use mirrors.
3742109	3743069	Well, like Brad Pitt.
3743229	3743949	Fuck the police.
3744129	3747611	Well, um, I can judge however I want to.
3747631	3753233	That was one of the criteria of judging was judge however you want to and don't be biased or anything.
3753253	3756254	You know, mirror is a boring thing to me.
3756354	3760815	Everybody uses mirror and it might face them towards the audience, but I don't give a shit.
3760895	3762636	Practice it backwards, you know, and
3763975	3771481	Yes, it was all the same shit, and it was good, and I gave him a high score, 80 is a high score, you know, that's a B, like I said.
3771521	3777225	So, you know, and then he wanted to be a whining, complaining shit, you know, and I'm like, whatever, I don't care.
3777245	3779366	I'll do what I want, I'll do what I want.
3779586	3779766	Uh-uh.
3779806	3783449	Yeah, so, you know, that's all on that, I guess.
3783849	3791134	Okay, well that's how you're famous in the community, so I thought we could explain that for everybody.
3791154	3792455	Yeah, that's the only way I'm famous.
3798405	3804288	I, you know, yeah, Dave showed me this ForthMix extra challenge mode.
3804568	3808010	As long as I'm in VR, I never checked out this challenge mode thing on ForthMix.
3808030	3808130	Why?
3808170	3809311	It's from the last week.
3809351	3809591	What?
3809611	3810171	Forget it.
3810231	3813153	Sorry, I wasn't here, really.
3813193	3819436	No, but it's weird because it, like, one of them, they didn't want you to hit the same arrow twice.
3819456	3822738	They had to play 59, and you couldn't hit the same arrow twice.
3822798	3824099	It was really weird.
3824239	3826140	And the next last one they just did was, uh,
3826775	3828396	It was, have you never been to Noah?
3828516	3836361	And you had to hit 350 perfect, and it was all just running left and like, yeah, 16th notes, just all the way down.
3837782	3842005	But it was just like, it was just like left, down, left, down, left, down, and really quickly all 16th notes.
3842045	3844547	It was pretty weird, and I thought it was stupid, but anyway.
3848246	3849266	Okay, oh great.
3849286	3852628	Did you have that sound effect of a screeching train coming to a halt?
3852768	3854169	That's what I'm doing right now.
3854229	3856570	I know, I don't have the screeching train, but I do have it.
3856670	3860331	I'm going to get one of those, because I'm going to be stopping the show.
3860351	3861032	That works pretty good.
3861072	3862933	It's bringing the show to a halt like I am all the time.
3862953	3864513	You know what other great sound effects I have?
3864593	3867034	I haven't found a use for this yet, but you know what?
3867094	3872197	If Irene ever pisses you off, you can just, you know, say, Hey, Dad, what's up?
3872217	3872337	Yes.
3872357	3872577	No.
3872657	3874318	Anyway.
3878263	3881026	I will be doing the fucking... Sorry, anyway.
3881106	3883028	I'm getting away from Inside Joke City.
3883128	3885730	And I'm talking about, oh, Polyglass Krispy Kreme.
3885770	3886291	I saw that.
3886551	3887052	You see?
3887112	3888593	He picked up the whole thing.
3888633	3889934	But none of us were looking.
3889995	3890595	You little man.
3890655	3895440	He wants to say something, but he can't because he has a mouth full of those, you know, those you can't see.
3895480	3896521	He's not a fat guy.
3896581	3897982	He's a very skinny, white guy.
3898002	3898863	Yeah, I love Krispy.
3899023	3900204	Okay, anyway.
3909107	3912868	Anyway, anyway, eat him and fuck him!
3917589	3919790	Um, this is my Arunco guy.
3920290	3921430	Can you say your guy?
3922911	3923731	Yes, Rob.
3923911	3926612	I'm surprised you haven't found out by now.
3926852	3931593	Thanks for finding out about our temporary goals here at Orange Lounge.
3931633	3934594	Anyway, speaking of Orange Lounge and everything, um...
3935282	3938584	Outside of this talk show, the whole rest of the week, we have a music program.
3938604	3940986	We are all sorts of Amani music, 24-7.
3941006	3947010	We throw in some Dance Mania tracks, some other stuff and some random games like Parappa, Bust a Move.
3947030	3949332	You know, all those other games that kind of led us to playing DDR.
3949372	3953495	I don't know about you guys, but before I was playing DDR, I was playing Bust a Move, Flash, Bust a Groove, too.
3953515	3955356	So, I'll find out.
3955376	3959119	So we have some songs in from that to kind of remind you of those days.
3959179	3960360	And we have a segment called...
3961098	3962858	Not in any of the money game, but should be.
3963219	3970940	And one thing I've been hearing from some people who have been listening to the stream pretty frequently is like, you've had the same damn two songs all week long.
3970980	3977122	You had Republic at Ready to Go, which was my choice, because I thought that was a pretty cool song for guitar freaks to be a really good song.
3977202	3986504	And also it's kind of got, it's got that vibe of it used to be a 90s hit, you know, a one-hit wonder band, and they've disappeared off the face of the planet.
3986524	3989245	Republic has nowhere to be seen anymore, which is totally...
3989861	3993444	Just like every other DDR band and song I've seen.
3993544	3995585	It's just some one-hit wonder band that's not around anymore.
3995606	3998087	So I thought it would be good for DDR.
3998127	3999749	And Jamie's pick was Shannon.
3999769	4000429	Let the music play.
4006022	4009003	What songs should be in the damn game that's not already?
4009143	4015866	And my choice for this week is actually going to be an old, kind of dating myself here, Yaz with Don't Go from the 80s is going to be my pick for this week.
4033993	4035334	You know that song?
4035394	4035855	Yeah.
4036055	4036956	Oh, I know that song.
4036976	4037196	Yeah.
4038016	4039037	I'm a girl.
4039097	4039678	Anyway, yeah.
4039698	4040579	That's a good song, though.
4040599	4041960	That's a good choice.
4042240	4045503	Because, I don't know, I kind of hear it as a 2DX song.
4045523	4047084	I think that's a good choice, but it fits perfectly.
4047104	4049006	What song do you think should be in a Bomani game?
4049026	4050928	What Bomani game do you want?
4050968	4053590	Well, I chose something for 2DX or, you know, 2DX.
4061207	4064148	And I chose a song called You're Not Alone by Alice.
4064688	4066228	That's because nobody knows that song.
4066368	4067029	I know that song.
4067489	4068289	Yeah, nobody else.
4068849	4069409	Which is okay.
4069469	4073190	And, yeah, like, nobody knows the song, but it's a good song.
4073210	4073450	Sheesh.
4073470	4077651	Why do you think this song should be in the air?
4077671	4079052	Because it's a good song.
4079172	4081012	I think it fits perfectly, um, that track.
4081132	4084593	I'm not playing You're Not Alone right now, am I?
4091489	4095273	Well, I know that maybe everybody out there has heard those songs, though.
4095333	4096114	Yeah, I know.
4096154	4100198	Well, if they hear it, they'll probably understand why.
4100258	4102119	So you think all of you know Longstreet?
4102139	4103020	Yeah, I think so.
4103040	4105663	Like, everything from the girls is in TVXQ.
4106003	4108185	I think that's kind of the genre, isn't it?
4108205	4110107	Like, five items.
4110127	4110327	Cool.
4110347	4110708	Cool.
4110908	4111228	Perfect.
4111548	4111708	Okay.
4111728	4112469	What about you, Brad?
4112509	4113170	What songs?
4115461	4126108	Okay, I just played DS with the three guys last night, but the one I don't want to... You can have your Crystal Nuts more than you, but Crystal Nuts song, uh, I'll... I don't know what it is.
4126148	4127429	Name of the game, yeah.
4127469	4128429	That should be in 3DX, though.
4128469	4131111	If there was any song I would like to have in 3DX, that would be the one.
4131131	4132092	That's just perfect.
4132172	4137635	It's got, like, all the great scratching along with just some great, you know, sounds almost like a tax song or something, you know.
4137655	4140617	I don't know if you want to play that for the audience or not.
4140637	4141778	So I'm going to pull up my list.
4141838	4142298	Let's see.
4142994	4144636	Let's just save it on my computer here.
4144936	4147017	It's in the directory there.
4148839	4150480	This makes for a wonderful radio.
4150540	4152602	Anything else you want to say about the song?
4152622	4154563	Which role is it called again?
4154583	4157205	Name of the game.
4157225	4157786	Name of the game.
4158666	4161288	Anything else you want to say about it?
4161388	4161829	It's good.
4161869	4163790	Oh, and it's kind of like a slide work.
4163810	4164170	Slide work.
4178112	4181195	What song and number money do you want?
4181215	4186019	Well, actually, one is kind of a little bit different.
4186039	4189522	It's the J-Trance, as I like to call it.
4189602	4191143	You mean, what was it?
4191243	4196607	It's M Above and Beyond by Amy Hamasaki.
4196647	4203253	Yeah, nobody in the VR community has ever heard of Amy Hamasaki.
4207611	4208631	I don't care.
4208651	4212772	DJ Big M should be here at the year's end.
4212852	4213832	And above and beyond.
4213912	4214753	Above and beyond.
4215313	4218133	I can totally see this in the next year.
4218213	4221554	You know, we're very, uh, fans of the DWI festival.
4221594	4223235	Actually, I've been on it, really.
4223255	4226235	Covered most of the, uh, cover songs we've got connected to these.
4237432	4238513	Oh, naturally he did this.
4238633	4239453	It's really awesome.
4239473	4242875	I have like almost every song I've heard in a year, actually.
4242895	4243136	Cool, cool.
4243156	4243916	What about you, Paul?
4244416	4244797	What song?
4244817	4246738	Well, this is a popular J-pop song.
4246878	4250020	It's been popular a long time ago.
4250080	4251701	I think it's really going to get old.
4251761	4254182	It's really rare and nice when people find you to play.
4254202	4257665	It's called Butterfly by a little band called Smile DJ.
4271597	4275080	I just wasn't born, I guess, when I was 15.
4275280	4276180	No, I knew that.
4276240	4281604	But if I came out, you know, only a couple years ago, I knew like several years ago.
4281624	4284406	But I was going to bat.
4285307	4286268	I don't care.
4286848	4287248	Yeah.
4287268	4288009	You know what they did?
4288049	4289830	Baby got fat.
4289850	4295234	Wasn't that on the King of the Hill thing when they did the DR parody on King of the Hill?
4295274	4298176	Yeah, but hey, if there's a one-hit wonder in this world...
4298852	4307602	The only other Sir Mix-a-Lot song I remember is that Jump On It or something like that.
4307682	4308844	Am I the only one?
4309124	4311086	Yeah, but I didn't listen to Crap.
4320713	4323075	I'm sorry, in the 80s, it was all about Paul Adler.
4323155	4326138	Oh, actually, Paul Adler was like 1990, but anyway, who's coming?
4326318	4327379	Is anybody else?
4327439	4328100	Who else is out there?
4328120	4330222	Get the, get the, get the other row.
4330242	4330722	There you go.
4344952	4353194	We want to hear what you guys think is, uh, should be in the money this month, already in the money.
4353234	4354015	Who wants to go?
4354055	4354895	Why don't you go?
4354915	4355175	Go ahead.
4355195	4362937	Alright, what I think should be the new VDR song or something that's coming out this year is Baby Box's Love and Ecstasy.
4363037	4363257	And why?
4371753	4375216	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4395112	4399333	The song Freaky is kind of like MC Hammer, but you can't touch it.
4399413	4399593	It is.
4399613	4400253	Super Freak?
4400273	4401853	Super Freak, yeah.
4401873	4405794	So that's Disqualified.
4405814	4408275	Dave don't give a damn about the show.
4408315	4410675	He just wants to show it.
4410695	4411035	Yeah.
4411075	4418277	We're getting a suggestion from the chat room that in 2DX would be anything but that violinist trance shit.
4418757	4422098	And I think you would be referencing Vanessa May, who is...
4424116	4424636	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4448382	4450443	I think I'm pushing the 800 song mark.
4450683	4452944	Oh, actually, you're probably about right.
4452984	4453164	Yeah, 1,000.
4453445	4454645	Well, I have 769 right now, I believe.
4454685	4458867	Are you talking about your own little collection you have on your computer?
4458887	4465050	Just basically, you're trying to compile everything.
4479542	4482703	Fan-made steps that are out there, and official ones, and stuff I'm making.
4482723	4488786	Another one that's pretty funny is called Duck Toy.
4488926	4492168	I don't know, that's by Hansenberg, it's like a rape song.
4505740	4507241	I don't know that one.
4507421	4508823	Then ERA, Big Cool Fat Mix.
4508883	4509863	That means Big ERA.
4510164	4512125	That's also a rotation on the station right now.
4512145	4516449	We decided we'd throw in some, they're kind of related to Bomani, but not really things.
4516529	4518210	So we have some remixes in there.
4518250	4520332	People kind of get sick of us now.
4520352	4520973	I'm working on it.
4520993	4522114	Yeah, you come in the file.
4522134	4522854	You come in the file?
4522974	4523094	Yeah.
4523154	4524976	Any other news in the community right now?
4525036	4525737	Emulation-wise?
4525777	4529400	Emulation-wise, the melting pot's down because Team Violet's hot down.
4529460	4531081	Actually, this is now that DDR Maniac
4535588	4542252	.NET, Holy Mayhem, Mirafor, Dance With Intensity, so you can actually use the file converter and download the program again.
4542792	4548535	It's probably all going to come up tomorrow since that's when the month is up and, you know, the bandwidth is probably gone.
4548555	4549316	Right, right.
4549356	4549616	Cool.
4550016	4550236	All right.
4551877	4554199	What do you think?
4554219	4554979	Should we take another break?
4555059	4556520	Any other songs anybody wants to add?
4557280	4559261	No, I think that'll do it for now.
4559482	4560202	Okay, come again.
4564605	4567246	You know what would be great, Mom and Dad?
4583315	4587437	You know what everybody would be saying if you started pairing to that song?
4587577	4593981	All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we'll come right back with more madness here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4594021	4594441	See you later.
4705808	4706949	Thanks for watching!
4872561	4873902	Thank you for watching!
5035845	5040027	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
5054436	5059179	Extreme Babani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
5059319	5063141	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number two.
5063201	5064922	Here we are, back and done.
5065817	5068460	Matt wanted to get in on the fun earlier.
5068500	5072603	We were doing the FU of the week, kind of trying to fill in for Jamie's absence this week.
5072623	5073524	She's off to Anime Expo.
5073544	5076307	She wasn't able to do it FU of the week, so we had one for her.
5076347	5080731	And Matt also wanted to get in, and he had a little bit of a wrap, as you must have seen.
5081638	5086522	Yeah, so my rant would be for those people that like to cut through the machine, namely Peripera and Dior.
5086542	5092686	Peripera, I always find people walking too close to me and end up backhanding them and that kind of thing.
5092826	5097990	Really, I don't care because if they're dumb enough to walk that close, I really don't care about hitting them.
5098010	5102033	But then you get those people who get pissed off when a game hits because they're walking too close.
5102113	5103534	And I actually tested this today.
5103594	5111040	I stood in the middle of a Peripera machine and stuck my arm out, and it actually, it's inside the machine, so these people are walking way too close to the machine.
5111835	5112315	and I hate them.
5112575	5113496	I hope they all die.
5113516	5116657	That pisses me off, too, when people do that on DVR.
5116777	5117937	And little kids do this all the time.
5118377	5126279	You'll be up there dancing, doing your thing, and then suddenly, you know how there's that little space between where the machine is and where the pad is?
5126319	5128540	A little kid decides that's the fastest way for them to go.
5128560	5132041	They'll run right between you and the machine when you're trying to play.
5132221	5136623	Like when you're in the middle of an Oni course or something, they just run right through the machine.
5136643	5137203	What the hell is that?
5141624	5161689	I gotta say though, ever since bad parenting, what Dolphin did a little while ago is that they took these little wooden platforms and kind of stuck them in between the machine and the pads, which actually I think really helped that because now little kids, if they want to do that, have to take a step up.
5161789	5165510	And I think most little kids are too lazy to do that, so they go around now.
5165550	5167831	So I guess problem solved in some aspects.
5167851	5171152	But now ParaPara seems like it needs some kind of moat built around it or something.
5172172	5174554	Seriously, I kept hitting this guy in the head.
5174614	5176895	You were hitting a guy in the head?
5176975	5177596	Well, okay.
5177636	5178356	He was bending over.
5178376	5179397	Was he four feet tall?
5179617	5182939	No, he was bending over and helping an old kid with a sumo machine.
5183019	5184360	And, you know, I hit him in the head.
5184480	5187982	I hit another guy, you know, in the ass because he was, you know... Hey!
5188022	5188082	Hey!
5195507	5196467	Thank you for watching!
5221286	5223929	Any suggestions on how a golf player can fix this problem?
5224229	5224509	Yeah.
5225170	5229394	Oh, well, there's no way to fix this problem.
5229434	5231856	Just, you know, people need to watch where they're walking.
5231896	5232637	I don't walk in front.
5232657	5233938	I mean, especially like mo-caps.
5233958	5236561	I mean, like walking in front of someone and playing mo-cap boxing.
5237041	5239604	I mean, if you don't want to get hit, don't walk in front of people.
5239644	5240685	Mass Execution.
5242376	5244697	I love all these practical solutions you guys come up with.
5244717	5245438	Rearrange the game.
5245458	5247338	You can't stay on the heat.
5247378	5248699	Get out of the kitchen soon.
5248999	5250160	I agree with you.
5250200	5252260	They should definitely rearrange the game.
5252280	5254921	Since MoCap's not working, why not put that there instead?
5254961	5256122	Put Parapara where MoCap was.
5256142	5263685	That's a good idea, but the thing about why they put Parapara and DDR and stuff in the area that they do is because there's arching, and they cannot fit through the arching.
5263705	5265926	I mean, I don't know why they don't just...
5271225	5272227	That's too high tech.
5272247	5275130	They have to pay an expert to do that.
5275190	5275670	I don't know.
5275690	5276651	This is what they're saying.
5276671	5280375	But that's why they keep them in that central area when you first walk in.
5280395	5281417	Nobody cuts through sumo.
5292786	5294867	You know, it's because I beg to differ.
5294968	5296789	I think sumo is a very gay game.
5296829	5300673	I mean, you've got this big red ball that people are sitting in.
5300813	5303155	It's somewhat fashionable.
5303175	5303755	Fashionable?
5303956	5305677	Fashionable.
5305757	5306238	Uh-huh.
5307759	5308720	Where is Shibamon?
5308780	5310221	Anyway, he should be on this show.
5312003	5313144	Shit, I just don't like myself.
5313224	5313704	I hope not.
5314725	5315326	Oh, okay, good.
5315346	5316387	Shibamon, where are you?
5322055	5323816	You know what's even worse than that?
5324237	5324637	What?
5324777	5326858	Kids that mock you when you're playing.
5327779	5328980	I have one of the worst, Brad.
5329000	5330160	Get Brad in here for a minute.
5330281	5332702	I want him to tell a story.
5332762	5334944	We have the worst hecklers this week at Golfland.
5335004	5336244	I want Brad to tell a story.
5336264	5339807	Brad, tell our listening audience about the hecklers at Golfland this week.
5339827	5340747	They were especially awful.
5340767	5346271	Well, there was these cavemen and they were like bouncing up and down behind me saying that they were, you know,
5349629	5355811	I was mad because I was losing, but I was asking the only love without getting any, you know, good sort of thing.
5356231	5359191	And so I said, you're even better than I was.
5359732	5360352	I don't know.
5360372	5361652	But I didn't say anything to him.
5361812	5366033	I just, well, I just stuck my finger on him and it happened to be the middle finger.
5366193	5368734	And he said, oh, you can't put me off.
5368754	5369834	So I did it again.
5369934	5373415	And he said, hey, if you do it again, I'm going to kick your ass.
5373435	5374915	So I did it again.
5374995	5376776	And I said, fuck off.
5376876	5377136	I'm going to
5377788	5379169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5403621	5415686	They didn't do anything, but I guess, you know, you get four or five guys together and they think, oh, it's only one guy, so, you know, what is it, Strength and Numbers or something like that?
5415726	5419447	Yeah, that really works, right.
5419467	5421848	Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
5422188	5423129	Yeah.
5423269	5426530	Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
5426550	5427891	No, it sure does.
5428991	5429231	What?
5429251	5431152	Can't they know to drive Strength and Numbers?
5434990	5439193	I have never been officially a droid addict, really.
5439473	5446077	Well, actually, I think the problem has kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.
5446137	5453001	I mean, I remember we used to be playing on USA Mix and stuff back when we had 4th, you know, and just swapping off of that.
5453481	5457604	And I actually had, you know, little kids trying to pick fights with me.
5458384	5459145	For no reason.
5459265	5462707	I was just playing the game, and they just come up and try to pick a fight with me.
5463007	5463908	You know, I just kicked their ass.
5463968	5464168	I'm like...
5465057	5466537	Where the hell did you come from?
5466838	5472439	And then, um, Hulk Knight, you know, Eric was there, and then, uh, he's like, so, what the hell?
5472459	5472959	What's a kid?
5472999	5474820	And he's like, no, you and I are crackheads.
5474980	5477440	And he's like, dude, Matt, where'd you find this guy?
5477480	5478301	He's just hilarious.
5478741	5482242	And the Hulk Knight kind of does look like a crackhead, but that's okay.
5482322	5484122	Yeah, but... But he's a great guy.
5484162	5484882	He is, he is.
5485122	5487723	Yeah, I mean, he only teased because we love him.
5487823	5488143	Exactly.
5488183	5492704	But, you know, I haven't had any kids in such a fight with me, especially little kids.
5492725	5493525	That happens all the time.
5493585	5494485	I mean, seriously.
5496883	5499605	Hey Brad, you look like a Kraken.
5499665	5502526	Remember that one kid?
5506489	5508831	You know that one, dude?
5508931	5512954	Remember he was making fun of any of his youth and someone else?
5513034	5519658	And then... Yeah, and then he goes and plays on DDR and we come up behind him and we tease the crap out of him.
5519858	5520719	I mean, we are mature.
5520819	5525342	And then we all kind of go away because we found something more interesting to play for five minutes.
5525382	5528344	I mean, when I say we all, that means there was like about five, six, seven of us.
5528954	5534861	And then this little kid, when we're not looking, gets on the machine and starts playing, as if we're not going to notice.
5534941	5539247	And I remember, we all got up there and started cheering him on, going, yeah, go, da, da, da.
5539527	5543011	And then he failed his song, and he ran to the bathroom and cried.
5543292	5546956	Yeah, and we were like, you're so awesome, I want your kids.
5548693	5555180	I think the worst thing that ever happened, or not really the worst, but actually probably the most recent, was playing the machine.
5555380	5564170	I had this guy, they're just like standing there kind of mocking me, jump up right in front of me with the camera, flash, and then jump off the machine.
5564610	5565591	And he did that twice.
5565771	5566853	I had people like...
5567353	5571274	I have this black guy, you know, he's standing there, and he's like, who's there, what's going on?
5571294	5576876	Then him and his friend show up, and it's like, pretending to freak me, and she's like, what the hell are you guys doing?
5577117	5578497	They're just acting like total assholes.
5578517	5580858	Why didn't you jump on that shit, man?
5580878	5584779	They're like, oh, freak dances, oh, oh yeah.
5585660	5587300	I hope they just want my side, man.
5587340	5592542	Yeah, you know, that's a reference to a movie, I'm not really just, yeah, okay.
5598772	5608078	You know, that reminds me of an earlier incident I had online with people, which kind of took me away from people, like, what are you going to do with that?
5608098	5611880	I was playing Grameen one day, and the guy said, Jamie got kicked out of golf class.
5611940	5614201	He was like, they're coming up, lost my Grameen.
5614261	5617003	I was like, that one must be quarter black.
5617443	5618804	I'm convinced now.
5619004	5620345	I was playing some Grameen songs.
5620365	5623947	That was exciting, but I didn't think it was going to be that bad.
5624027	5627149	Wait, they were saying you were a quarter black, or they were saying Jamie was a quarter black?
5630651	5631673	Are you a quarter black?
5631693	5632975	Well, I like it, you know.
5633276	5633817	Okay, yeah.
5633897	5635480	Anyway, let's change the topic now.
5641205	5644888	Well, I got physically removed by somebody from the VR machine.
5644968	5647109	How did you get physically removed?
5647129	5650892	No, a guy jumped up onto the stage and grabbed me and threw me off the machine.
5651413	5653294	I was physically assaulted on the machine.
5653654	5655215	Were you raped on the VR machine?
5655235	5657497	No, guys, like I said, straight to numbers.
5657537	5660699	I got ten guys together and I'm like, hey, look, there's one person playing an arcade game.
5660719	5661500	Let's make fun of him.
5661880	5662861	And he said, you can't.
5662901	5663641	Let's gangbang him.
5663661	5663961	Yeah.
5663982	5665102	So I failed my course.
5665122	5666423	That's why I pissed on him.
5666523	5668285	I didn't care that he was being a jerk.
5668305	5668825	I was just like,
5669005	5682376	I failed the course, I was away from the dollar, so I pushed him and he said, oh no, you're going to hit me, but his friend stopped him, I guess, and I was like, yeah, you don't want to start shitting with me because I'm white and skinny.
5682456	5689983	Yeah, I could hit you with my lanky skills, really.
5692065	5693486	Matt has brought with him to the show.
5694175	5696676	This week, a lovely VCD.
5696796	5699216	You explain what the hell this is, Max.
5699276	5699817	I really don't.
5699837	5700857	I still haven't figured it out.
5700897	5704558	I watched 10 minutes before the show and I still haven't figured it out.
5704578	5708339	Actually, what this is, it's a VCD, actually two VCDs.
5708359	5712800	We've got one that's called Parapara Dance and one that's Parapara Stadium.
5712860	5714981	Everyone knows what Parapara Stadium is.
5715021	5718622	It's just Parapara all-stars doing the routines for different parasols.
5719301	5720562	So you can learn them.
5720582	5727148	But the first CD, Peripera Dance, is a bunch of different clips from this one variety show that's actually on TV.
5727228	5731172	It's starring Takura Kimura.
5731613	5732694	And this guy, that's it.
5733482	5736424	Yes, I believe it's Takuya Kimura.
5736464	5738005	Just thank you.
5738306	5739747	Alright, that's it.
5739807	5750735	Anyways, what this guy is, is he's a singer and actor from Japan who in the 90s started doing hers on TV and actually kind of made it popular again.
5751235	5755076	And so we've got a clip, I mean, because this guy, he plays a character called Bucky Camara.
5755116	5758797	Now, we have to remember that this is radio, and the audience can't see what we're playing.
5758817	5766599	Now, the people in here can see what we're playing, because it's on a giant monitor here, but we kind of have to do the best we can to make this radio-friendly segment, so you might have to explain what's going on.
5766619	5769280	Okay, well, basically, the scene starts off, it's kind of...
5774199	5787047	So what I'm going to do is, I'm sorry if they have a class that actually shows these people with almost looks like springs on their arms that actually, you know, kind of like those muscle springs to strengthen your arms.
5787067	5789208	Kind of like buns of steel, that sort of thing?
5789249	5790049	Yeah, that type of thing.
5790309	5795793	Anyways, so let's get started off with them and doing this, and I'll kind of narrate this as it's going along.
5795833	5796393	So here we go.
5796413	5799635	And you have to spin up.
5802893	5803954	And we need the volume.
5806936	5809597	Okay, so basically things getting faster and faster.
5809617	5813159	We're kind of speeding up the film here in a ridiculous fashion.
5813179	5814100	This is goofy.
5814200	5817422	Yeah, it's a Japanese goofy style here.
5818042	5820384	And the springs are breaking dramatically.
5821504	5822845	Because, yeah, it's a humus tour.
5823025	5826828	And now enters Buffy.
5826848	5830190	Whose theme song is Maya Fierce?
5835256	5855516	and they're showing us a statue of him, a bust of him and out he comes with the Iron Paragunther with the lights everywhere and stuff and a poopy bottle and now he's going to do a passport turn the beer which I must add, I like this car, I think it's awesome
5860615	5861516	Here he goes.
5861656	5862857	Oh yeah.
5862897	5863937	Michael Korsnick.
5863957	5865298	This is one of those guys.
5865318	5870942	Definitely.
5871002	5871823	He's my idol.
5871863	5876046	Yeah, how come the English school in New York has an idol like an ass?
5877707	5880849	I mean, all the schools in the United States.
5880869	5882830	No, no, I think, I figured it out.
5882910	5886413	It was cool because he has 50 hot Asian women behind him.
5886453	5886993	That's why.
5889489	5897773	Anyways, this is pretty much the normal part of the video, him doing this routine, which is... He's just got a lot of style.
5897793	5898813	He just is very cool.
5898953	5901734	And now it gets ridiculous.
5901854	5908577	It's showing him perfecting his technique, his end pose, as you might say.
5908597	5910098	Now he's getting ridiculous.
5910238	5911358	It's a Kofu Haramata movie.
5922799	5924140	He's poking past lasers.
5925481	5927963	He's got people fanning him down, his arms and stuff.
5928003	5929424	He looks like Gatsby right there.
5929684	5933366	And now he's gonna do the traditional kung fu thing with the candle and moving fast.
5934147	5935268	And blow his candle out.
5942133	5943213	And he's still dancing.
5946256	5949538	In the classroom, I might add, with all the disco lights everywhere, out of nowhere.
5950882	5955046	Now everyone's stopping, he's ripping off his shirt, and under his shirt is that spring.
5957888	5959870	He's putting the metal things on there.
5959930	5962873	And they're taking the springs off.
5963313	5964474	They're taking them off.
5964514	5967897	And now he summons for his assistant, some hot bathing shirts.
5968017	5969598	And here he goes.
5969859	5973742	Oh, and his final move, and the dress comes off.
5978468	5980549	Everyone cheered because it's so stupid.
5981289	5984030	All the Asian women cheered because they got to see a panty shot right there.
5984050	5984531	Marilyn Monroe.
5984551	5985391	I know the Marilyn Monroe.
5986271	5988292	All right.
5988412	5989572	Let's do one more question.
5989592	5990913	Any more of this crap?
5991293	5992373	Yeah, worst radio ever, guys.
5992393	5993313	Worst radio ever.
5993454	5993814	Okay.
5993834	5994754	That was great.
5995594	5999215	We're being experimental, damn it.
5999235	6000576	So let's give it one more chance.
6000676	6003017	I really wish I could all see this because this is actually...
6004369	6006751	Maybe we can put some still images up on the site later.
6006832	6008393	Yeah, you need to rip some of this.
6008473	6009875	I'm going to put this on the site.
6010215	6010675	Oh, definitely.
6010695	6012657	You know, I may want to rip.
6012978	6022227	Okay, and now we're going to have the theme's inside of a club, and there's some J-pop singer who I have no idea who it is.
6022287	6024609	And the theme appears to be some sort of cover of EQ Up.
6034441	6047493	And he comes out doing his Night of Fire bit.
6047633	6050936	And there's Persistence raging out of stage now at Phantom of the Opera.
6051736	6053098	Or Phantom of the Parapara.
6056020	6057341	Phantom of the Para, guys?
6062373	6066095	And he walks through microphones right here for no apparent reason, I don't know why.
6066155	6068496	And then he walks away.
6068536	6072077	Then he can, uh... He's doing a pose and the camera swings.
6072137	6073958	And he's doing another turn.
6074038	6075219	Okay, one more here.
6075299	6077440	Okay, we can only do one more.
6077500	6079260	If I can cover V2 up, I think.
6091435	6095738	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6113493	6117294	And there's old people playing croquet, and there's a guy in a coat that you can't see his face.
6117354	6119235	And that's his trademark whistle there.
6139446	6141187	Oh, get out of here, Robin!
6141327	6142568	I guess in the dark.
6142668	6143429	It's dark!
6143489	6151654	And all of a sudden, the outside becomes... Is this the life in the yard?
6151834	6154716	And he's doing another fire again.
6166625	6170466	And he's noticing people aren't dancing, and they're staring at him like a nut.
6170686	6175067	And the old guy recognizes him as Bucky.
6182268	6185349	And so he's going to put in a tape that the old people can dance to.
6185489	6188990	Oh, I see, because old people don't listen to CDs, they use tapes.
6192065	6201035	Night of Fire Upward Version Nothing is more funny than watching a bunch of old people terror in a facility.
6218809	6220969	This is what you're going to look like in 60 years.
6220989	6223710	This is Milpita's stall plan in 60 years.
6223750	6226111	Alright, everybody give a big hand for Madness.
6226151	6228391	We're getting a comment saying, this is sad.
6242998	6244680	Alright, that about sums it up.
6244760	6250866	On that note, we're going to go ahead and take one more quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap it all up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6343854	6344921	Blow my whistle, baby
6542441	6545904	We often wonder how some of those Bomani songs are chosen.
6551970	6552811	We think we figured it out.
6552831	6553852	Orange Lounge Radio.
6567779	6572301	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, just about at the end of our second show.
6572741	6576162	I am your host, Rob Roberts, or you might know me as Skye.
6576182	6579643	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, is not here this week because she's at Anime Expo.
6579924	6581604	So filling in is the lovely Irene the Rice Princess.
6581624	6583585	And of course, we also have in studio many, many guests.
6583645	6586626	And I'd like to thank all you guys for coming this week, as she did last week.
6586646	6593048	We've got Matt, we've got Paul, we've got Brad, we've got Bradley, who doesn't say anything, but he gives moral support.
6593088	6595729	And in the other room, we've got Glenn and Dave.
6595769	6597030	Dave's coming in the room right now.
6598564	6603966	I guess I thought I'd ask you guys at the end of the show, but I really should have asked you guys at the beginning of the show.
6604006	6604646	How was your week?
6604686	6606887	Anything exciting going this week?
6606907	6609068	Anything you want to talk about openly on the radio?
6609148	6610008	I work all day.
6610028	6610768	Parking every day.
6611049	6611489	Parking?
6611549	6613249	Freaking Brazil.
6613489	6614930	And Sunsplash Parking.
6614990	6616450	Their whole parking lot was full.
6616510	6618351	Parking across the street was full.
6618371	6626074	If you wanted to get to the Sunsplash, you either drive around the parking lot for half an hour like I did, or you go park across the street at the hotel, which probably also was full.
6626494	6626634	Wow.
6627342	6629263	What was something going on there today?
6629283	6630884	Yeah, it's called the water park.
6631484	6634506	There's a drawback with having a big, nice park like us.
6634526	6637087	Since we have a water park, it's always busy.
6637127	6639808	You can't find parking space during the summertime.
6640168	6644610	And there's going to be tons of people in their swimsuits, dripping water all over the pads.
6645111	6647071	And a ton of hot chicks in bikinis.
6648312	6649613	I don't go there to look at hot chicks.
6649673	6650293	I go there to play.
6654990	6655871	I don't need to go.
6655891	6657452	Shaz, you do it too.
6658593	6659914	Shaz, you do it too.
6660014	6661475	Shaz, you do it too.
6661616	6662296	Shaz, you do it too.
6679597	6681240	I'm worried nobody listens to the show.
6681320	6681681	It's okay.
6681701	6681962	I know.
6682042	6682583	I get arrested.
6682603	6683144	Look, right there.
6683164	6683665	Zero listeners.
6683685	6684126	Let me know.
6684146	6684326	Oh, yeah.
6684386	6684607	Oh, yeah.
6684647	6685849	The police are listening.
6685889	6686370	Let me know.
6692066	6704593	I had time off work this week, thank God, and I basically spent my time sitting at home playing old school video games, because I discovered that my greatest use for the Dreamcast is to burn old Nintendo games and just play them on the Dreamcast.
6704633	6705354	Why would you burn them?
6705374	6706314	Why would you give them to me?
6706454	6707995	Not like that, like burn on the ceiling.
6708155	6708795	I don't know why.
6708816	6709576	I don't know why.
6709596	6709896	Shut up.
6709916	6710757	My dog ate Kona Mix.
6724033	6730518	and I discovered, I rediscovered my love for the Guardian Legend, the old 8-bit Nintendo game which was half shooter, half Legend of Zelda.
6730738	6731639	I love that game so much.
6731719	6734121	If they ever made a sequel to the Guardian Legend, I think I'd quit DDR.
6734141	6738084	If I'd be too busy playing the Guardian Legend, I'd quit DDR.
6738104	6742747	What old school video game would have to come back for you guys to quit DDR, you think?
6742768	6742988	For me?
6743068	6743248	Attic.
6751367	6754409	What are some good old school games that need to come back?
6754509	6756591	Oh, you know what's coming up, didn't we?
6756671	6759593	I don't know.
6759773	6760834	Oh, yeah, we're making it.
6760894	6761635	Rygar.
6761655	6763156	We're making Rygar.
6763316	6763897	Are we?
6763917	6764177	Yeah.
6764197	6764798	Ninja Gaiden.
6764818	6765658	Shinobi.
6765698	6769301	And, of course, we know it's coming at some point.
6769321	6770262	Mario Kart.
6770462	6770742	Oh, yeah.
6770762	6774065	Are they going to make a Mario Kart on GameCube?
6774105	6774706	Oh, I don't know.
6774726	6776827	They'll make it for everything that matters.
6778744	6781085	And that's always the game that gets me to buy the system.
6781105	6783645	So once they've made it, they've sold themselves another game too.
6783685	6790167	Alright, I'm talking about old school video games, not the game theory stuff.
6790267	6791668	Masha, I want Duck Hunt 2.
6791768	6792008	Huh?
6792028	6792628	Duck Hunt 2.
6792668	6793048	Duck Hunt 2.
6793088	6793328	Yeah.
6793348	6795609	Where you can finally shoot that fucking dog.
6795689	6796249	Yeah, exactly.
6796289	6797769	The dog's revenge.
6806201	6807102	What about Goonies 3?
6807222	6811906	No, they're making a Goonies 2 movie.
6812067	6815690	It's actually going to be with the kids.
6815710	6817612	There was a Goonies 2 video game, remember?
6817632	6817992	Yeah, it's back.
6818012	6819133	The Goonies 2 was the video game.
6819153	6819654	Yeah, it's back.
6819674	6820414	What about Goonies 3?
6820474	6821115	I mean, any of them.
6821135	6823297	With another Cyndi Lauper remix.
6823337	6824278	Wouldn't that work?
6833311	6846401	And they did it like Symphony of the Night, you know, it's all... All gothic, and then you get Shonic, and then Shonic, like, he had a little, like, circle trail following behind him, but it's really just his sense of smell.
6846441	6848283	Baby, you've got Rocky Road!
6848363	6849143	Rocky Road!
6849303	6851405	Oh, for once.
6851425	6859471	Well, you know, they're actually, I know they have it in Japan and stuff, but they're actually making a lot of action.
6863658	6866601	And then on the next episode, how about Quirks the video game?
6866641	6867641	Do they have that yet?
6867681	6869443	No, but that'd be awesome.
6869543	6872225	That would be awesome, but what would you do in it?
6872265	6873146	You'd just shoot customers.
6873266	6873987	It's a quiz.
6874107	6874607	It's a quiz.
6874627	6877129	Are you supposed to be here today?
6877209	6877590	Of course not.
6899445	6901806	I don't know.
6901866	6905927	Who says we have to spend time with money for two hours?
6906847	6907228	Come on.
6907248	6907408	Yeah.
6907468	6909308	You know, I would crush it, wouldn't I?
6929726	6930786	That's a cool game.
6930806	6933347	That is a freaking awesome game.
6933967	6937708	They need to make a good sequel to Blaster Master.
6938468	6938849	That's true.
6938949	6943250	I'm just ignoring all those other copies of Blaster Master that they've done since.
6943290	6944730	The first one still exists.
6944890	6946131	The first one is awesome.
6946151	6948791	You know what?
6948831	6949471	Blaster Master.
6949511	6950432	Blaster Master.
6950452	6951232	Blaster Master.
6951272	6952652	Your HP tastes so good.
6963986	6967267	Ooh, by X-Commando, another by X-Commando, that'd be pretty cool.
6967327	6973530	I mean, they have one in Game Boy, but, yeah, he's already on PS2, that'd be cool, or some other, you know, system.
6973550	6974750	Yeah, there he goes!
6974770	6975751	The guy has legs!
6975851	6976231	I know!
6976311	6978372	You know what I mean?
6978792	6981073	With jumping abilities, someone's like, uh-oh!
6981133	6981433	Uh-oh!
6981553	6981873	Uh-oh!
6981913	6982073	Uh-oh!
6982133	6982533	Uh-oh!
6982553	6982753	Uh-oh!
6982833	6983054	Uh-oh!
6983094	6983274	Uh-oh!
7002676	7006820	Well, on that note, I think it's about time to close out the show.
7006840	7019369	But I thought I would also bring up, before the show's over, I'm going to get to pay five more dollars a month to keep this station running because of the carp royalty, well, they're not carp, but the royalty rates that were passed this week by, I don't know, some judge.
7019429	7021951	And I'm horribly misinformed on what's going on.
7021971	7027095	But basically, long story short of it, Internet Radio is now going to have to pay seven cents
7027782	7030505	for every thousand listeners that are listening to the song.
7030865	7039714	Now, not that this station should have much of a problem because we don't have any listeners, but unfortunately, our host, Live365, decided to do a blanket fee for everybody.
7039794	7043237	Everybody's going to have to pay $5, which, you know, is a cool way to do it.
7043337	7047281	Live365 has been pretty good at keeping up the station going on and everything.
7047341	7052406	I can't really knock them because they do provide a really good service because this thing would never be able to run off shoutchats.
7052952	7064499	But if you do think this sucks, I would visit SaveInternetRadio.org and have a read there on what's going on with Internet Radio because if over-the-air radio stations aren't having to pay these kind of fees, why are we?
7064579	7066440	I guess there's quite a lot going on.
7066460	7067441	Save Internet Radio, guys.
7067501	7069222	So SaveInternetRadio.org.
7069262	7069982	I'll leave you on that note.
7070022	7070423	Let my PPL go.
7087697	7090018	Well, we could pay for last show and this show combined.
7090098	7093620	Anyway, while we figure that out, do listen in next week.
7093640	7101205	Jamie's got the week off again, but we'll have Irene or somebody will be, yeah, two or one.
7101365	7101825	I'll be here.
7101845	7104727	We're not supposed to disclose the amount of listeners.
7105727	7106347	We don't want that.
7106407	7108589	Is everybody else going to be here next week?
7112580	7114681	Thank you for listening, everybody.
7114701	7115461	Have a good night.
