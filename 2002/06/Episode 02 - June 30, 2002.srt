00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, you're being onto us, you mess!

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You want to a cute happy moment?

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Yeah.

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sad that I haven't had a chance to put you in the match.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's about love.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's go with the high.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's go high to the high.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Come on, darling.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You turn up in the way.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You there.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, okay.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm working on it.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Run.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm about to run, baby.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Really?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Run?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You do the best.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You do the best.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Run.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's your host Jamie Summers AKA Dark Sakura.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But, off this weekend, Jamie has decided to skip town a bit early to head off to the big Anime Expo convention in Southern California.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But we have a substitute teacher for you tonight.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello to the lovely Irene.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you very much.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Or you can simply call her the right person.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is episode number 2 for June 30th of 2002.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We are joined in studio once again by a whole bunch of senior personalities.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Say hello everybody.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,200
Hello!

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,000
We'll be talking to some of them more a bit later, but first a very quick break.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Any other opening thoughts for you?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh great, last Christmas.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Why don't you look at some Christmas presents?

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Oh, um, okay.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Open the thing you can't come up to the show.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
It's in your boyfriend.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Oh, um, okay.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to try the new triple taco one.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Give me a hug.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That is a thing so much.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Good morning.

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Oh, fun money. I still don't have money. Do you think coffee's worth it, Mr. James?

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't think so.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay, 50 things on the way. Yeah.

48
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Alright, we'll be right back after this quick break.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
We'll be talking about all sorts of fun stuff this week.

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Another two hours to be killed before mommy's back at the movies.

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh

52
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I

53
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

54
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
We love you! We love you!

55
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Wooooo! Noooooo!

56
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
We love you! We love you!

57
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Noooooo!

58
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
We love you! We love you!

59
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Noooooo!

60
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Extreme Bopati Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

61
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
That is us. Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the second broadcast.

62
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh yes! Look it up over there on the other computer.

63
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Are you being pirates?

64
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Arrgh!

65
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
And she'll throw me a thunder.

66
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
What is? What? Yes.

67
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Did you hear about that new pirate movie?

68
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
No I didn't.

69
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It's rated Arrgh!

70
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh, I can always count on you for a funny joke.

71
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm so glad Jamie chose you this time. Let's see it for the sake.

72
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Jamie is supposedly joining us in the chat room right now, but

73
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,000
now, but she's under the name Bright Sakura, so I have to admit I'm a little skeptical, so I just have to

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I have to quiz questions to make sure it's really who it is. So we'll see if she's able to frankly identify herself.

75
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
She's so pretty.

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Bright Sakura.

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Well I imagine if I were junior right now, I'd be in a pretty puppy mood too.

78
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Oh, I'd be like, pretty. You know that is so awesome.

79
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,000
You know that she's been the past four days working on her costumes.

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Probably nonstop.

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
I've barely heard from her in the past week.

82
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,640
She's spent so much time and effort working on the costume with all the friends of hers, she's been helping her out.

83
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,760
This is awesome.

84
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,260
Yeah.

85
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,760
And who is she going to love again?

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Um, um, don't go down the street fire and then there's some, some angel.

87
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Angel friends you might need.

88
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah, angel friends you might need too.

89
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,760
And it's wearing all black.

90
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
And then there's a hot air person.

91
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,260
Yes, was it that hot?

92
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Was there a hot air person?

93
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
I don't know.

94
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,060
This is how much we know about anime here, so...

95
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,260
Oh, Jamie's gonna show us some chipmunks.

96
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Oh my gosh!

97
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Okay.

98
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
So anyway...

99
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Well I thought, uh...

100
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Well that's what you're talking about, this whole, uh, Solo 2000 thing.

101
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,260
This is about the only thing in the bohani news that's pretty big right now, since there's no new games coming out, really.

102
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Uh, Solo 2000...

103
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,260
The evil, evil machine that it is, getting pulled from bowling alleys and things across the nation, that's just one so far.

104
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Um, but it's starting to kind of cause this fear and panic amongst other people, like oh my gosh, are they going to pull our solo machine in a place that we're happy USA makes, so what's going to happen?

105
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:08,260
To make things worse this week, uh, Fox News in San Diego, Channel 6, aired a special little report, and I thought we'd air it for you here on the show.

106
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,980
And that's how we can all respond to it live on air.

107
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,020
If you ever want me to pause this you can kind of just let me know, but let's take a look at this little, little news story.

108
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,340
This is coming to us by the way from Bomaniac.com and then I just recently stole it from them.

109
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
But basically I'm providing it for the internet, so here we go.

110
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
I enjoy stick for a button.

111
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
And then it uses your feet.

112
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
His aim is called BXBS revolution.

113
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
It's popular among kids and teens.

114
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,340
And now some are saying they're shocked at what they're actually seeing.

115
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Half the kids need to put a tonic. Half the kids need an hour or more of talent.

116
00:10:37,340 --> 00:11:06,980
We're running back the

117
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
to bye bye baby balloon.

118
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Oh my gosh.

119
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Hey, hey, this looks easy.

120
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,980
And more importantly, this looks like dancing hot.

121
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,980
When you're out there and you have the music going on.

122
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,980
When I see this woman up there talking on the screen right now I'm not thinking about fun.

123
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
I don't...

124
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Who is this lady?

125
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Her name is Pamela Cameron and she's a mom.

126
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Just a mom.

127
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
Just a mom.

128
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,980
She's probably the only white lady in San Diego.

129
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
I used to live there. I would know.

130
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,980
I've been waiting for an hour and I didn't know that there was a corn line so my kids go up and start looking at me.

131
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,980
There's things we're moving on and the most thing for six is meat.

132
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Oh!

133
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Yes, yes evolution of meat.

134
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
I thought it was pretty small myself.

135
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
It's the bee's meat.

136
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Hahaha!

137
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Hahaha!

138
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Hahaha!

139
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Hahaha!

140
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
CDR's meat.

141
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Today I'm going to ask you a question but I was really quite aligned because you're there and I...

142
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Ahh...

143
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,980
I was really quite alarmed. It was a shark!

144
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,980
Oh, it's a nurse and pill.

145
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Pills all around and needles and holes at my back.

146
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Even if you just lay them on your chest, they'll be safe.

147
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,980
But if I had to, I would say, hang on.

148
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Oh, do you see what I see?

149
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Oh, I see.

150
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
Oh.

151
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,980
What do you see?

152
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,980
That's why a local youth group said that.

153
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,980
What the fuck? Why did you even have to point that out to me?

154
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Dogs are actually the nurse administering like children and meals and stuff.

155
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
You know like that's the whole theme.

156
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,980
It's not like they're the opening thing bringing drug dealers in the background.

157
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Oh my god, it's a drug dealing nurse.

158
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
I know.

159
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Ah, shit.

160
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
How about any of them?

161
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,980
They're the ones who give me the name of the one.

162
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Is that the chick?

163
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:05,980
I know this chick's name is Jamie Bernstein, who is a member of the advocacy coalition, however, it's not the same person that's catching all of that.

164
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Forget her name.

165
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
So come on, baby, yeah!

166
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Ha ha ha!

167
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,980
She's getting too much better than her!

168
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Ha ha ha!

169
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Ah, damn it.

170
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Okay, anyway, let's see.

171
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Oh, right on.

172
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Um, um, if you come from any movement, there are very, very, um,

173
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,260
So, the team will believe that these are the machines that are on the show.

174
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,660
And it's way, way better than it ever comes with a machine that can have these machines.

175
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,980
Okay, however, the machine she's playing on is still a six-manner machine, so...

176
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,260
You know what's funny?

177
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,780
They show a picture of Nast, and then they have, like, all the needles and stuff,

178
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,100
but then they replace it with a skull and a machine.

179
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,820
Like, they show the picture of Nast at the top, and at the beginning when Nast is playing it,

180
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,340
they're showing, like, uh, somewhere over the rainbow and bye-bye to the balloon.

181
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,340
But then when they show the needles, they saw on the, uh, solo machine.

182
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,340
And then they go back to the mat, see how they're replacing it, and they show the solo machine.

183
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,340
That's what we replace through it, and it doesn't really make sense.

184
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,340
But, these images are still on some local dance machine!

185
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Well, you know, how are you going to take them off of the machine?

186
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Of course they're still going to be on one.

187
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
Are they going out of the hammer-on?

188
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
I want to know if that was how someone noticed this, Toby.

189
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,340
This guy doesn't look like he ever notices a line.

190
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I believe this is the owner of the bowling alley that's around there.

191
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
But it's just so tiny.

192
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,340
But the event is a few arms, some local bands, and a shoe.

193
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,340
I never know if that is where someone lives with their baby.

194
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I never know this yet until someone mentioned it to me.

195
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,340
Wait, what? One of those animals?

196
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,340
I don't know that movie, but it seems like the guy who just sits there in the back of the bowling alley

197
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
faces out for a little while during this shit.

198
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
You're probably the janitor!

199
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

200
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Look! Look! Look!

201
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
We plan to make some changes.

202
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
Hey, listen. We've got so many things out there

203
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
that we really need to change

204
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
our lives and our lives actually.

205
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
The fun is to see that.

206
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
See? There's too many things

207
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
out there to change.

208
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
So, let's start with those

209
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
evil dancing machines.

210
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
In images

211
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Now some pieces of space should have never been there in the first place.

212
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Now these bands were sent as soon as you might know this, but look what I told you, it's nine billion fifty percent of the planet.

213
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,340
I won't point out most of the bands, bands, revolutions, and scenes do not contain images of drugs or diseases.

214
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
I did find that all in that.

215
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
So what do you guys think of that beautiful little report?

216
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,340
We are making it back into the news media again.

217
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,340
That's pretty cool, because you know, anything that sets a controversy is obviously going to become hugely positive.

218
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,340
And, um, the fact is that they had that contradiction themselves.

219
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,340
They said there's already been, yeah, there's already been change, you know?

220
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Or some years ago, you know?

221
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,340
Hold on, we have to stop the show because they want to play with this flincy that's sitting on the desk here.

222
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,340
So, hold on a minute.

223
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
Very good.

224
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Enjoy.

225
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
Alright, I'm sorry.

226
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
I know a lot.

227
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:19,340
And they should put a warning on the Earth that says if you play this, you're going to, you know, evoke the dark lord Satan and he's going to come and eat your children.

228
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:31,340
I mean, no! Seriously, I think there are more, you know, people out there doing worse things than hunting the Earth, which is good for your health and there's so many benefits to them.

229
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,340
And I'm not going to, obviously, listen to everyone else that's playing.

230
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:42,540
That's actually the first time really I've seen those images that they've been referring about on the, on the article and all that stuff

231
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:52,140
like these evil images of the nurse riding on a syringe and stuff because I've only voice told her 2,000 one time and I didn't play with them.

232
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,540
You know, why don't you manage what your children are doing?

233
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,540
You know, if you don't like them, why don't you, don't let them play, but don't clap and say hello.

234
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Why would you leave your kids with some guy in a bow and arrow who look like that?

235
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,040
Oh no!

236
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,540
It's just sitting in the back.

237
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,040
Not, not, not holding on.

238
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,540
Yeah, and you didn't do worse things than the frickin' new guys!

239
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,040
Oh my god!

240
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,540
Geez, they don't, they don't, they don't like to think, they just like to feel.

241
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,540
You think we're going to be seeing a lot more of these kind of new stories, Seth, are we?

242
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I don't know.

243
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,040
I don't know.

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,540
I don't know.

245
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,040
I don't know.

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,540
It's amazing.

247
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Yeah.

248
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
There.

249
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm actually, I don't know, guys.

250
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,540
I don't know.

251
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I don't know.

252
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
I don't know.

253
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,040
I don't know.

254
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Anyway.

255
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Um, yeah, so, well all those pills look exactly like the pills from Dr. Mario, you're absolutely right, at a point.

256
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't remember that up, counting as one of them, of course I was kind of younger then, maybe there was something going on,

257
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:55,040
but between them, Dr. Mario wasn't just provocatively, you know, in a cute little bikini outfit, you know, and straddling a syringe, you know.

258
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Do you think that Dr. Mario has been like Dr. Princess Peach, but with a different issue?

259
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,040
And she would like, you know, straddling the little viruses and things like that.

260
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Maybe, who knows?

261
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Sorry, what?

262
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
It was so hard.

263
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I know, but I think like if one of the viruses were going down on her, you know,

264
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
it wouldn't like that.

265
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,040
But, um, if it were talking to mine on a big screen, I'd kill myself.

266
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
That's pretty gross.

267
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
But yeah, I don't know.

268
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,040
That's probably just because it's that female thing that you don't see on TV every day or anything.

269
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
You know, some girl has...

270
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Well, maybe you are going to see it on TV every day. I just flip it through the news stations and oh!

271
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I mean, I'm just running in general, standing with my eyes, you know?

272
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Open up the newspaper and look at the laundry section, you know?

273
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
And then whack off to it, too.

274
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,040
It's called See, All of the Wild, I'm special.

275
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I know!

276
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Behind the Playboy mansion.

277
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
And MTV!

278
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
All of it.

279
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
So, in a brilliant sphere.

280
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I know, guys.

281
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:03,040
So, if you'd like to join us in our chatroom, we got comments you want to give on this, go ahead and join IRC.APEX.ORG

282
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:13,040
And then the channel is Orange Lounge and hopefully within the next week we will have a little online applet thing that you can just load right in your browser to get on there.

283
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
So we'll work on that for the next two weeks. So it's really easy to get in our chatroom.

284
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:25,040
If you do have any comments on it, go ahead and visit our chat room if you know how to get into MIRC and we'll read some of your stuff on the air if you want.

285
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,040
In fact, I'm being corrected that Jamie's costume for Anime Expo is Baiken and the Mad Hatter.

286
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah, I wouldn't think that would happen.

287
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
What is it going to happen?

288
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah, how bad?

289
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Uh-huh.

290
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Also, comedy, it's a nurse. It's giving props to doctors. It's raising medical awareness.

291
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Yeah, you know.

292
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,800
See your doctor. Get your check-ups ready, truly, which I don't do.

293
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,480
So I'm not playing enough solo today.

294
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
I haven't been to the doctor in three years.

295
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,980
I've been to the doctor in three years.

296
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,240
Oh, well, she took my crossfit. I'm bad.

297
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm so bad.

298
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Shut up.

299
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Heh heh heh.

300
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Heh heh.

301
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, and then we'll come back with, uh, many, many FUs of the week.

302
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Everybody, now that Jamie's gone this week, it seems like everybody has their own FU in the week.

303
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,080
And also, Paul will be giving us his Drama Drama Revolution wrap up.

304
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,040
So, uh, stay tuned. We'll be right back in about three minutes.

305
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
There will be the Orange Lounge radio.

306
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

307
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,760
and

308
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,760
the

309
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,760
the

310
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
the

311
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,760
the

312
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

313
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:52,760
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live for this June 30th and Brad is back in the house and he has brought Krispy Kreme's with him.

314
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Thank you Brad!

315
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Yay!

316
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
What flavors do we have here?

317
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Oh yummy!

318
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I don't want one of those rolls of bacon, I reckon.

319
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
That thing's pretty good.

320
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Oh I do have some for a bite.

321
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I should be on a diet.

322
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Although I did take, I did take back what I made this week.

323
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
I decided that it was pointless.

324
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Why didn't I make these delicious?

325
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I didn't mean to.

326
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Too good for me to be doing that.

327
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,760
And you know what I noticed today? I went to Monboli and Barbecued today and I was only able to eat...

328
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I put beef in it because I figured it's awesome back on red meat, let's go overboard with it.

329
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,760
And I was only able to eat like a third of the bowl. Whereas if I usually get like chicken or anything else, I eat the whole damn thing.

330
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Does that happen just like with drones and stuff?

331
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,760
It's probably a protein. You can try to give me this whole spiel video with protein and things like that.

332
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,760
So I don't know, maybe my body's just reacting to it.

333
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
It's kind of like putting myself on a diet in a way, if I'm eating well.

334
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,740
Hey!

335
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,940
Yeah, can I help?

336
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,100
Can I help?

337
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,600
Yeah?

338
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:54,180
Anyway, Jamie Summers is on vacation this week, and actually she's going off to N.A.E.S.M.O.

339
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,140
But she has a little segment she does every week, or at least she did it last week,

340
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,080
and she says she's going to be doing it every week, so I guess we'll see what she does then.

341
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,160
Called Jamie's F.U. of the Week, and since she's not here tonight, I'm going to fill in my own little F.U. here of the week.

342
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Hi, um, my F.U. is awake.

343
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,160
People who can't follow the three things open wide.

344
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I hate it when I'm up there and they say there's only one coin up on the machine.

345
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,160
There's my coin up on the machine and I'm just kind of sitting down in the back watching.

346
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I was at some kind of place this week where this happened and I'm not going to say

347
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,160
what the establishment's called or the dean was called.

348
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
And then this other person comes up and puts their coin on the machine.

349
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
There's a lot of these two coins on the machine.

350
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,160
So when the person who's on the machine finishes their turn, the person who just put the coin up on the machine starts to go in.

351
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm like, hey wait a minute, did you see that other coin on there? It's like, oh no, sorry, my bad. I thought it was my turn.

352
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,160
It's like in the store now. I think so.

353
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Like this person just had no concept of a wine. It was just kind of like, oh, put your token on the machine and I think you can go next.

354
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,160
You know, I mean, this is why these people will put all their tokens in the machine.

355
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm like, okay, you can get one with me!

356
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Oh, then you put like four tokens up on the machine.

357
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
This means I'm going to play it four times.

358
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,160
And then, yeah, I'm like, okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.

359
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,160
And when they do that, I pull them up and say, well, you know, this means fuck you, fuck all.

360
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm gonna play now.

361
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,160
And you know what I hate about the token right now, so I was trying to explain it to parents.

362
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Because sometimes parents just don't understand.

363
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Yay!

364
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Okay, Will.

365
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Yeah, I know.

366
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Um...

367
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Ahh...

368
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Baboo!

369
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I don't understand.

370
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Someone had to sit the dad down, like, and explain to him over, like, 15 minutes before he went to work.

371
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
And then he just came back to work.

372
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Did they have to, like, draw out a map?

373
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Yeah.

374
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Like one of those wily coyote footprints?

375
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Yeah, but I don't understand if they have.

376
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:03,160
You know, Harvard degrees, and they make millions of dollars and blah, blah, blah, but that's not an addition, a simple process of a plane line.

377
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,160
What do you guys think about the plane line? Do you think this is an effective way to keep track?

378
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I mean, we all go to D.E.R. regularly, we all happen to go to the same place.

379
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,160
We all waited until the line, a lot of people here waiting in the line. Do you think it works, or what?

380
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
No, what other kind of methods do we have?

381
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
It works when you have like a few people playing.

382
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:29,160
We've got like eight people waiting to play and there's just so many children that you can't even remember which one's yours or when you're going up because there's so many on there.

383
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,160
I think once you get somewhere like four people, then you need to find another way.

384
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Oh, I just think that it's easy to just have a little rat on the side of the screen that they put on some video game scenes.

385
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,160
And that's when that person came around that I looked at today, took a little sauce, wanted to write three poems,

386
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
that you just remember your number and you just kind of want to know your numbers like that.

387
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
You know what bugs me about that system sometimes,

388
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I was at Stockton Golf and a local system at that system too,

389
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,160
where they have their slots that say one through eight

390
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
and you put your coin up there so you remember what number you're in.

391
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
But sometimes people go up there,

392
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
they take their coin out of number one,

393
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,160
and then they move all the other coins over one space,

394
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,160
which I can see the point of that if all the coins did look the same.

395
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,160
The thing is that it's very confusing because you don't know what to do.

396
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Did you get your coin, but you moved them down? Did someone else put their coin in the place or something?

397
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,160
And then, you know. Oh, yeah.

398
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,160
I want to buy you the triple chocolate. You can't touch that.

399
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Okay, I didn't see that right.

400
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Sometimes it starts with outlines and then it shows as well.

401
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Sometimes it starts with an outline and you put your coin up, you know, maybe number 3.

402
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,160
And then you get shots each time.

403
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
And then it starts with an outline and then it's leading the dance on the head.

404
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Oh no, Stockton's golf land problem is not getting glorious game numbers as part of the problem, but I would say their four year old princesses are a much bigger problem than even at Roseau Golf Land.

405
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Stockton's Golf Land has some mean children. I mean, the ones above the golf land are snotty children, but the ones at Stockton's Golf Land are mean.

406
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:12,160
They'll like step on your feet, they'll throw all the coins off the machine. They're the type that when you play Monopoly, you know, you're going around and if they lose the game they just throw everything up in the air and go, I quit.

407
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,760
I quit. You lose, you suck.

408
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,960
What fun would I have?

409
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,060
Hahaha.

410
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Do you have a problem with it, mom?

411
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,660
Oh, I could be at school if I ran the car.

412
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,160
Yay!

413
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,860
Haha.

414
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,860
What about other methods other than the token life?

415
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
There's the list.

416
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,860
The list. How does the list work?

417
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
You write your name.

418
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. But how, does it work? Is it good?

419
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,660
It depends on how many people. It's pretty pointless if you only have, you know, a handful of people.

420
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,660
But, you have like, remember in the previous cell phone when they first started using our machines how to do 40 people a night?

421
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
I think it works very effectively.

422
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,660
I remember we used to do that at Roosevelt and when we got the fourth next machine and we had a sign up sheet going on there.

423
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
But, then it just kind of stopped.

424
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
Or it didn't go on until we stopped doing it.

425
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,660
Because, you know, it works with a group of people each other all the time.

426
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,160
When there are people that just want to go up and play, you know, they don't know what they're doing.

427
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,660
They don't know anything about any coin mining or lists that they have to put their name on.

428
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
They won't think it's fair. No complaining about it.

429
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,660
But I would say a sign-up sheet is easier to show somebody.

430
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Like, hey, we've got a system going on here than trying to explain why 10 coins are all up on the machine right now.

431
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,660
People who are parents, I don't know, or people who don't play CGR in an arcade scenario,

432
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Oh, I don't see that. As much as they would see a sign up sheet that says, you know,

433
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
write your name below if you'd like to get in line with mine.

434
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Well, maybe they just shouldn't write it yet.

435
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
Maybe they sh-

436
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Hey, oh. Maybe they shouldn't break up in the morning.

437
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Hey, Matt! Maybe they shouldn't shoot themselves.

438
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Oh, sorry. I don't think that's true.

439
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Stupid people aren't here. It's stupid.

440
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
So, what are you looking at?

441
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
I don't know.

442
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Stupid people can't do anything by us saying that.

443
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
Exactly. That's what usually happens. They put us in it.

444
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,660
They should do is establish some sort of bowling system.

445
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,660
You know how they have a bowling alley where you type your name in and then your turn comes around?

446
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Well they should do that, you know, have something like that where you just get one turn

447
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,660
but you're suggesting that they invest, because all plants have already or whatever place

448
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,660
has these DR machines already paid $5,000 for their machines.

449
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Well in some cases they paid $1,000 for a bullet.

450
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,660
But nevertheless they paid at least $1,000 to get this machine

451
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,660
and now they're going to invest another $1,000 just so that people can get one.

452
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Oh sure, kids, I mean, look at the video maps you have created. How fast does that make its money back?

453
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,660
I bet it's paid for itself within the first two weeks.

454
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Sure, it's worth a black market, I'm sure it is.

455
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:46,660
But is it worth it to buy another thing just so people didn't mind? I mean, because people are constantly replying anyway, it doesn't matter.

456
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Yeah right, they probably wouldn't understand either of those.

457
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:56,660
I don't know. I think a lot of it is the arcade really doesn't give a shit who goes when, if honest, there's constantly quarters that you put in the machine.

458
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
We only have two working machines in those little plans.

459
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,160
Yeah.

460
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,660
But they don't, they don't care. They're not gonna like it.

461
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,660
It's, it's being suggested in the chatroom that everybody just be given their own machine.

462
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,660
There it is.

463
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,160
Right.

464
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,660
It's a solo machine.

465
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
It's a solo machine.

466
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Look at all the solo machines you're taking away.

467
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Absolutely. They can see if they're solo machines.

468
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,660
At least a solo bass machine that is a little bit late for that.

469
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Solo bass is by far the worst ER mix we've ever made.

470
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,660
But Solo 2000, Solo 2000 is a little better.

471
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
At least have like twice as many songs.

472
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
It's got some non-stops.

473
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,660
You can change all your difficult voice panels.

474
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,660
Is solo bass the one that was in SoCal, the one other than RKL?

475
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
We want to know.

476
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
It's not there anymore though.

477
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
We have to get to that.

478
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:48,220
That one was not bad. You know what the worst one for me is? It's 1.5.

479
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,860
But it would ever. Anything 1.5 before if there was ever 1.6 before.

480
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,140
Yeah but at least I got the retro value at this point. You know whenever somebody plays Boom Boom Dollar

481
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,460
it's like oh you're being retro. You're going to lose a dollar.

482
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,420
But if somebody's playing...

483
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,100
What happened?

484
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,140
If somebody's playing, I don't know, what was the solo bass song? I don't even know what songs were on that machine.

485
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,180
I Know Why.

486
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:18,180
The most annoying paranoia was on a live with some anime evolution, super stars, typical tropical.

487
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I'm gonna get typical tropical, they just go, what is that?

488
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
I don't know.

489
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,180
I feel like I'm still always fixed now. I want to live 4th now. I hate 4th now.

490
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,180
That's another thing so much about when you pick 4th now or 6th now or 3th now.

491
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,180
You know, 3th now, I'm not any more incorrect so I don't give a shit.

492
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,580
It's beautiful. I don't, you know, I don't care. But, yeah, I write it.

493
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,180
I mean, she writes syringes in her spare time.

494
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Exactly, you know! I own a ranch, but you can write a syringe.

495
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Yeah, um, yeah!

496
00:35:53,180 --> 00:36:01,180
Anyway, yeah, so, I, that's kind of one of the benefits of soles, is that you can take N4 and 3, right?

497
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
You can take 3.

498
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,180
So, I mean, that 3 is what, up, left, and right? You can also use the upper left and the upper right.

499
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,180
He's down in the upper left hand.

500
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
This is my EPT dancer mode.

501
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
Yeah, whatever.

502
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
What, I'm sorry?

503
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,180
Combine pump it up in DVR and that's all that.

504
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
No, not in DVR.

505
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,180
This is not the classic person's first pose on most DVR bullets and boards, though.

506
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,180
If I shouldn't have made the 9th level DVR,

507
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Do you think Konami is just waiting to do this or do you think it's not practical for a Nintendo VR or what?

508
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,180
How does that not work?

509
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Oh, so that's a lot of stuff to be watching, although, granted, if you can do 2DX, which is 8 things you have to watch,

510
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,180
or keyboard mania, which is what, like 26, 52 if you're playing doubles, things you have to watch,

511
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,180
It's, you only have two feet, and you're not paying attention to how much something is on it.

512
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,180
I don't know, it'd be worth a try, it'd be fun, but I don't think it's going to be a fashion market.

513
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,180
And that's why Techno Motions is taking off, because it's super fun.

514
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Yeah, that's the, um, and that's the Korean one that you gave to me.

515
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Four pounds, five pounds, or eight pounds, or four times, there's no nine pounds on that now.

516
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,180
But, yeah, it's like everybody, hey everybody's doing techno motions!

517
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,180
There's lights in the motion, and you can't see, and it's sticking in my finger right now.

518
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
Ah, ah, okay.

519
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,180
So, back to the coin line. You think you guys think it's effective for now?

520
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
You don't, you don't know any better, I'll tell you.

521
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,180
What should, what should I, what should, what should,

522
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,180
How can we better educate everybody on the coin line?

523
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,460
So they're just invited people to see the show right now.

524
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,960
Huh?

525
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,460
I'm done.

526
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm done.

527
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm done.

528
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,960
Ha!

529
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,460
Very practical.

530
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,960
Thank you.

531
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,460
I'm done.

532
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,960
I'm done.

533
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,460
I'm done.

534
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm done.

535
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,460
I'm done.

536
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,960
I'm done.

537
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Oh, you mean my... tell them how, how can you...

538
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,460
How do you think our kids need to get in and get involved?

539
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Do you think, do you think that our kids should have a sign posted saying,

540
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,960
hey, here's a coin line policy.

541
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,460
So that way parents go up and go, my kids been waiting.

542
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
If we're waiting, we are.

543
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,460
You don't want to decide you're shaking all of those.

544
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,460
You can't please don't care. They're there to breathe their tubes and have somebody else say these to them.

545
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,460
And if it takes more than two thoughts, which is, where's the access?

546
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,460
It's like, uh-uh, they don't care.

547
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,460
They don't care. They just want to give them their money and give them their keys.

548
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Well, fuck them. Maybe they should care.

549
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,460
Well, you know, when parents say stuff like that...

550
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,460
Will they care if I step on their child?

551
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,460
Yeah, you should say, what do you know? There's a nice bucket of syringes on here.

552
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
Do you really want to say goodbye?

553
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
No, I'll speak for him.

554
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, actually, I think that, both friends especially, do they really want those angry people

555
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,460
that are yelling that the players are yelling at them?

556
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,460
They need to say, oh hell, fuck the players, let them yell at them.

557
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,460
So, what's the point?

558
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,460
There's a little more to that, because if people are yelling at the players, the players are obviously,

559
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,460
even when the players point at people complaining, they're going to go back to girlfriend, you know,

560
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
and complain, it doesn't matter.

561
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
They're always going to get complaints, doesn't matter.

562
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,460
It's just a matter of who's gonna complain.

563
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
So, maybe you can tell me about it.

564
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

565
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

566
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Yeah, I mean, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.

567
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,460
For my senses, um, either they won't do it or they'll take a long time to do it.

568
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,460
So, I, I don't know.

569
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,460
But, I mean, I've seen some teachers were separate from them, so.

570
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,460
But I don't know, as far as the little coin line, it's more than implied saying that there's no set rule

571
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
that anyone has to follow a coin line.

572
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,460
You know, they can just say, fuck off, I'm going to play right now.

573
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,460
I'm going to fuck off, I'm going to play right now.

574
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,460
Now that's something else that bothers me that I see.

575
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,460
This happens at the really, really crowded places.

576
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,460
Say, an arcade in the Bay Area is the very first place to be a brand new machine.

577
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,460
50 coins up on the damn machine.

578
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
You have no idea who's going when.

579
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
Somebody will just put their coin up there.

580
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,460
If they'll leave, they'll go play some better games for an hour or whatever.

581
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Then they'll come back and go, oh by the way, it's my turn.

582
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:20,460
That, that, I don't know. Do you think that if somebody puts a coin up they should be obligated to wait there until it's their turn?

583
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,460
They put that thing in their dues, they should wait there?

584
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
To go?

585
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Oh, not necessarily. I always end up leaving coins on the machine and I'll just say,

586
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,460
okay, there's two people in front of me, that's enough time to play one game,

587
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
here, here, come back and watch.

588
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,460
You know, I kind of estimate how many people are going to be in front of me and then

589
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,460
But what I use when I put my coin up to go push that mouse to come back to go click on the machine.

590
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,460
And I see what I know when we hit the pocket.

591
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,460
Like, if there's ten coins up on the machine, like three or four weeks ago,

592
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,460
and I was a girlfriend and all these people on the boards,

593
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,460
on the second money boards were talking about,

594
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,460
now they hear how people just put their coins up and then leave and come back out and they're like,

595
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,460
oh it's my turn to get these mother's coins at that five times.

596
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,460
So what I do is I put my coin up to count how many are before,

597
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,760
And as soon as that person's done playing, I yell out to the whole arcade,

598
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,160
I'm nesting five people! No one takes my turn!

599
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,160
And then so everyone knows, just like when my turn.

600
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,360
And it's worked every time.

601
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,760
That's why, that's kind of similar to what I tried to do when I did my coin mine.

602
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,760
If I put my coin up, I go, okay, who is the last person to put their coin up?

603
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm going after that person, the hell with the rescue.

604
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,360
Although, I almost got killed by a little kid, a little, I think a little four year old,

605
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
The music video is expressed on a live video!

606
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
Who's watching the video?!

607
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

608
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,360
Have you guys heard of any other methods of keeping track of the coin whenes besides, er,

609
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm sorry, keeping track of when the return is for the money besides coin whenes,

610
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
fine as sheets?

611
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Right off the smart ass helmet.

612
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I know, I punch you in the face.

613
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Thank you. Thank you, Redhead.

614
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
How about maturity?

615
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
How about the maturity?

616
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,840
I think that's really the thing that's important here, because if somebody else has turned,

617
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,480
it is, you know, before you were acting, you can say, you know, I know when I turn.

618
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,760
And if somebody's wrong, I'm not the best now. You can just let them go, and you know you're the best.

619
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,880
Because that person, Elizabeth, says, it's my turn, and they also did that for you because you selected your answer.

620
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,360
And that's what I saw and all, but you're talking about video games on the most immature pastimes on the planet.

621
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,240
And then, after waiting for ten people, and she's going, no, but I was after him.

622
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,240
Yeah, well I wasn't kind of cut in front of me even though I was before him.

623
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,240
And then the next person goes, but I was before him.

624
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Yeah, see that's where emotions start to crash.

625
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,240
The times I try to be nice is exactly what's happened.

626
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
And then it's like, okay, why did I bother?

627
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Why should I bother?

628
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Is that my education by gunpoint?

629
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah!

630
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,240
So what the news is is how, just like the customer service desk that's hard to get

631
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,240
and that belly and stuff, they now serve inside.

632
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,240
You take a number, you know, wait your turn

633
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,240
And then once you see them pillow, oop, out of the point of the machine, now it's serving.

634
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I was actually thinking that would be a great, great system to use in a tournament, actually,

635
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,240
because I don't know how many tournaments you guys have been into, the EA portions,

636
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
and what makes it happen, everybody's qualifying.

637
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
It's like, they'll call the next person and then they'll say,

638
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Oh, that guy's playing, ah, they're up there right now.

639
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
We've got to go get them when their game's finished.

640
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
And everybody's standing around there waiting for two minutes.

641
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I think in a tournament that would be a good idea to use.

642
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,240
These little pull-pass things are not necessarily pull-passes, but have the little counter, and it's like your number is so-and-so.

643
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,240
So when it's about four people before you, you better be waiting by the machine, because you're trying to qualify or you're out.

644
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I thought that was a good way to speed up urban detection in the future, getting around those mistakes.

645
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,240
But do you think that would have worked in a normal arcade setting?

646
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
A few, four, two, five?

647
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
You look through a lot of these apps.

648
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah, yeah.

649
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
And who's going to pay that?

650
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,240
And I'm going to take five in a row, so I get to go five times.

651
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,240
If you see something that's not here, watch this video.

652
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,240
And then over here, alright, so...

653
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Look at that!

654
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
This is every day!

655
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
This is like playing the lottery.

656
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Do I have to? Oh yeah!

657
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
So you just want to do 30 or something like that.

658
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,240
And then once you're done, you take it from the top.

659
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
So watch having those little members at Carl's Jr.

660
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Well what happens to those members at Carl's Jr.?

661
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
They get stolen!

662
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:57,240
This is...how many of those a-hole hecklers now are gonna just take numbers and go away though?

663
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Ah, let's just put this away.

664
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:05,240
The problem is that we're gonna go way too far too down to do anything if there's no way.

665
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:12,240
But everyone, everyone here agrees then probably the topian line's the most effective thing for now or do you think it's...

666
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Actually, we would have started doing something else by then.

667
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh, you know, and we're gonna be trendsetters here.

668
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Well, we're reaching out to the masters. We can be...

669
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Oh, then we use the toy key and set everyone's name on separate coils.

670
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,240
And then we roll the strings down and put whatever coil it lands on.

671
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Oh, hi.

672
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Hi.

673
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Alrighty, alright.

674
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
That's a hush.

675
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
You see? You know, Mom?

676
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Yes.

677
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Unless it's our machine, we can't really establish anything.

678
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,240
We can try to do a lot of stuff, but you know, it's not our machine.

679
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,240
I know we care about it, but we should only do so much.

680
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
It's not our machine.

681
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,240
I mean, people are the ones that spend the money on it.

682
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
They don't use a craft.

683
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
They don't have to fix a toy, fix a token.

684
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
That's all they care about.

685
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
They don't care about you and their feelings.

686
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
And they don't care about it.

687
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
If you spend five dollars, that's five.

688
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
It's totally ours.

689
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
Exactly.

690
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
It's not our machine.

691
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
We can't, you know, make it a kind of

692
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I'm trying to fool over it, so...

693
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Shouldn't our data take that extra responsibility on the bad idea of it?

694
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,240
What, they forgot their thing? Maintain the bad idea of it?

695
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
Oh, you mean work? No, I'm talking about...

696
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
I'm talking about, uh, the lines.

697
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
Oh, oh, sorry.

698
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,240
I mean, fighting games have had this problem since, you know, Street Fighter 2 came out, you know?

699
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Well, I guess the token lines kind of evolved.

700
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
They are a family amusement center, correct?

701
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,240
So they should be doing something to manage it, you know?

702
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,240
And as usual, most places have four test scores.

703
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:53,240
And there's nothing you can do about it until something either gets killed or gets sued or gets fired.

704
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,240
I forget about it. When I look at this, people don't know how to take turns.

705
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,240
When we went out in the chair garden. How sad is it when we can't take turns?

706
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,240
People don't understand the concept of taking turns. That's really sad.

707
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,240
It's really sad. Why do these people argue this for a living?

708
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
They understand. They just don't want to do it.

709
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
These are people who play our plays, you know?

710
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,240
They're serving our government.

711
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,240
Right in our country.

712
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm not that cool. I don't have that good of a job.

713
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Okay, it's just a cross section of America.

714
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,240
Well, cross section of the society of America.

715
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,240
All right, am I also going to say anything on the coin lines, taking turns, things they

716
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,440
should have learned in kindergarten, things like that?

717
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,440
And on that note, we're going to take another break. We'll be right back.

718
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,440
This is where you'll take the CD for ear. To the brand new world we're going to solve for Captain J.

719
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Hey, how are you?

720
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Oh

721
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:20,720
I see the world by the hand of a stranger I see the world by the hand of a stranger

722
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Oh yeah!

723
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Oh yeah!

724
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
You're so good, boy.

725
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,220
This is perfect!

726
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,220
This is all I got.

727
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,720
It's really good.

728
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,720
Come on.

729
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,720
It's really good.

730
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,720
This is so cool.

731
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,720
I love this show.

732
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,720
Oh, yeah!

733
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
Oh

734
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
Oh

735
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Orange Lounge Radio, a modern music and more program, might be interesting to listen to in the kitchen.

736
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,720
We have reported incidents where exposed listings in this program in the kitchen

737
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,720
has caused people to bust out a shabby fan, draw arrows on the tile, and start stomping away.

738
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,720
The Family Public Service Announcement of Orange Lounge Radio.

739
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,720
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live.

740
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:28,720
I want to turn the mic over to Mr. Paul, a.k.a. Pauliver, to talk about Drama Drama Revolution.

741
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,720
Yes, that would be all of the drama that goes on in the online community,

742
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,720
on all the different golden doors out there.

743
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,720
Paul volunteered, I guess every week he didn't help us out with this.

744
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,720
You know, there's a lot of stuff I've been waiting for.

745
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,080
There's a lot of stuff in our show.

746
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:49,920
Well, every week, if there's enough material, material pending, and Paul continues to the show, uh, pending or whatever,

747
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
Paul wants to give a wrap-up.

748
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,420
And we're gonna call it Drama Drama Revolution.

749
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,620
So go forth, Paul.

750
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:02,220
Last time on The Last of Money, Antonio and Matt, and Americano and Bi-Boy,

751
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,520
were curious and curious as one of those to turn into a giant dragon eating themselves for breakfast.

752
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,520
She poured more milk on them than they need them across the place.

753
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
To help the flavor.

754
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,520
And that's how I came in.

755
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,520
These are my powers, Yoda's and Bo's.

756
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,520
And we tried to, you know, build the water and the whole thing.

757
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,520
But this was just a failure.

758
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,520
And then, on the off-grid, I couldn't read anything.

759
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,520
This was all the summary and then I had to put the pen.

760
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:44,520
I'm, uh, Jeannie Cohen, from The People of Brisbane, uh, three of the four of you I think have done, and four of us, have to try to, uh, transition on, one day, on, uh, local picture board.

761
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,520
Oh, yeah?

762
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,520
Can you hear someone?

763
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Yeah.

764
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,520
Just try to help, Paul.

765
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
Uh, try, uh, try to help me.

766
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,520
Uh, and, uh, this is why I need to write this.

767
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,520
Yeah?

768
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
We don't write the show, I see you could write the show.

769
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

770
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
Look behind the show!

771
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,520
I mean, God, everyone just died. Everyone died, I mean.

772
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Any other board you want to wrap up for us?

773
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Everyone's dead, I don't know.

774
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,520
Alright, well, don't drop out of the pollution.

775
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
Thank you very much, boss. Or something like that.

776
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,520
Irene has a joke. Alright, we'll call a joke and then we'll come back.

777
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,200
We'll take it quick break and then come back for the top of the hour.

778
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,320
Or whatever.

779
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,800
Yeah.

780
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,500
See, was that your joke?

781
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,920
What do you call a deer that has no eyes?

782
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:38,940
What?

783
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,440
No idea!

784
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,920
What do you call a deer that has no eyes and no legs?

785
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,420
What?

786
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,180
Still no idea!

787
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,080
Ahahaha!

788
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,840
No!

789
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,960
I don't know!

790
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,680
Alright.

791
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,860
I'll take that.

792
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,360
Oh gee.

793
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,240
Anyway, we're gonna do another song and we'll be back.

794
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:55,740
Real Prime!

795
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:25,160
Hey, alrighty, it is eight o'clock, it's the time of the hour, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our second broadcast, if you couldn't tell, we're still doing this.

796
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,160
But thank you guys for joining us on this early broadcast of Orzam's Radio.

797
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,160
My co-host, DarkSakura, is out of town because she's gone off to Anime Expo.

798
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,160
So filling in this week, it's the lovely rice princess, Irene. Say hello, Irene.

799
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Ah, hello, Irene.

800
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,160
You're very famous in the Bomani community for something, Irene.

801
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,160
I don't know if you want me to bring this up on the show, but I think it's funnier.

802
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,160
You want to tell us about it, what you're famous for in the scene?

803
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,520
You want me to explain it? Well, we had this tournament in Sacramento back in October.

804
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,800
We are stacked. Sacramento's cosplay and tournament.

805
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
No dirty connotations at all needed.

806
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,440
And you happen to be one of our judges from Risa.

807
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,160
Uh, because we, uh, we ended up having an equal, I believe, male and female judges.

808
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,160
No, we had more female judges than male judges, didn't we?

809
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:17,320
Um, I don't remember, because we had you, we had Wanna Girl, Sharks Girl, and Dr. Cora.

810
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,840
Yeah, we had three male judges.

811
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,840
I didn't want to judge you for that. But you were, you were the infamous judge on my channel.

812
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,840
Oh, yes, yes.

813
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Because you wrote on somebody's card, um, I would have given you a higher score. What was it you wrote on his card?

814
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,840
I believe, um, a higher score would have been given this year or was it you?

815
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
Yes.

816
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
And I gave them a score of 8.

817
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,840
Yes.

818
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Which is a bad score.

819
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
Which is a B!

820
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
You know, what's wrong with a B?

821
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
You know, but anyway.

822
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,840
But you, you took a lot of heat. Well, you didn't take a lot of heat for this movie.

823
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
All of a sudden I looked at the heat bar, but that's okay.

824
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,120
And you know why?

825
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,840
You know why?

826
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,280
I don't know for a moment.

827
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,960
No, no, no, that's fine.

828
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,240
You know, so, yeah, anyway, I guess I just think that this is...

829
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,120
The hell with drama drama revolution is you're smart.

830
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,000
You take a lot and go, like, don't get on these online things.

831
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,840
Oh, wait a minute, you're on the online radio show.

832
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,760
Yes, I am, but I like this.

833
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,960
I don't care about if people get mad.

834
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,600
Is there any other comments you want to give on that?

835
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,480
Like, you know, I need to get back.

836
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,080
What do you have to say to the people that are like,

837
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:22,080
What the hell are you thinking in a mirror thing and why would you give it a little score and of course you use mirrors.

838
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,080
Well, like breakfast. Fuck the police.

839
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:33,080
Well, um, I can judge however I want to. That was one of the criteria of judging was judge however you want to and don't be biased or anything.

840
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:40,080
You know, nearly the boring thing to me, everybody uses mirroring and my face enjoys the audience but I don't give a shit.

841
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,080
I tried to sit backwards, you know, and, you know, I tried to do something different.

842
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,080
Yes, it was all the same shit, and it was good.

843
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,080
And I gave him a high score, 80 is a high score.

844
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,080
You know, that's a B, like I said.

845
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,080
So, you know, and then he wanted to be a whiny and complaining shit.

846
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
You know, and I'm like, whatever, I don't care.

847
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
Give me that one, give me that one.

848
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,080
Uh-uh.

849
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:08,080
Yeah, yeah, so, you know, that's all on that, I guess.

850
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Okay, well that's all your favorites in the community, so uh, I thought we'd maybe find that for the end of the week.

851
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,080
The only way I'm saying this, uh, yeah, yeah.

852
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,080
What is going on outside the other room?

853
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Well, I just, I, you know, that, uh, Dave showed me the Fortnite extra challenge mode.

854
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,080
Uh, it wasn't really, uh, I never checked out this challenge mode thing on, uh, Fortnite.

855
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,080
And it wasn't the last week.

856
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,080
What?

857
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,080
Uh, forget it.

858
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,080
Uh, sorry, I wasn't, yeah, really, I wasn't.

859
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,080
No. But it's very difficult. Like, a lot of them didn't want you to hit the same arrow twice.

860
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,580
So you had to play 59 and you couldn't hit the same arrow twice.

861
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,580
It was very, very nice.

862
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,580
And the last one we did was, uh...

863
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,080
And it's how you never been low, and you had to hit...

864
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,580
360. Perfect.

865
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:54,580
And it was all just running left and, like...

866
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,580
Yeah, 60 notes, just all the way down.

867
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:03,080
But it was just, like, left down, left down, left down, and really quickly all 50 notes.

868
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,080
I don't know. It's pretty weird.

869
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,080
And I thought it was stupid. But yeah.

870
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,080
Okay! Oh great!

871
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,080
So do you have that sort of thing?

872
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,080
There's a screeching train coming to a halt.

873
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,080
That's what I'm doing. I know. I don't have a screeching train, but I do have a...

874
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
I'll get one of those. I'm going to be stopping the train.

875
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Okay. That was stupid.

876
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,080
I'm just bringing the show to a halt right now.

877
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,080
You know what? You know what other great sound effects I have?

878
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
I'm not going to be used for this yet, but you know what?

879
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,080
If Irene ever pisses you off, you could just, you know, say,

880
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Yeah, that was pretty good, didn't it?

881
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,080
I'm not really sure.

882
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
There's no losing that.

883
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
It looks like half.

884
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Like, quarter of the Christmas tree looks like it ate the whole thing.

885
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,080
Anyways.

886
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
Anyways.

887
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Be good and sparkle!

888
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,080
Um, this is a, uh, a room full of guys.

889
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,080
Can you see your guys?

890
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,080
Yes, well, I'm surprised you haven't found out, Mona.

891
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Well, thanks for finding out about our temporary goal, John.

892
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Anyway, speaking of Orange Lounge and everything,

893
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,080
outside of this talk show, the whole rest of the week we have a music program.

894
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
We are all sorts of Omani music.

895
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,080
24-7 we throw in some dance media tracks,

896
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,080
some other stuff and some random games like Parappa, Bust-A-Move.

897
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,080
You know, all those other games that kind of led us to playing D.R.

898
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,080
I don't know about you guys, but before I was playing D.R. I was playing Bust-A-Move

899
01:05:52,080 --> 01:06:01,080
and we have a segment called, not a give a money game, but should be, and one thing I've

900
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,080
been hearing from some people who have been listening to the stream very frequently is

901
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,080
like, you've had the same damn two songs all week long, you had Republic already to go,

902
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:16,080
which was my choice, because I thought that was a pretty cool song for guitar freaks to

903
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:26,580
to be a really good song, and also it's kind of that, it's got that vibe of it used to be a 90's hit, you know, a one hit wonder band, and it disappeared off the face of the planet.

904
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:36,080
Republica is nowhere to be seen anymore, which is totally just like every other DER band and song I've seen. It's just a one hit wonder band that's not around anymore.

905
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:42,080
So I thought it would be good for DER, and Jamie's hit was Shannon with the music playing, because Snow is a new song.

906
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:57,080
We're finally replacing those two songs this week with some new songs.

907
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,080
But I want to hear from the panelists here.

908
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,080
This is kind of that old age old Ramani question.

909
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
What song should be in the bandana this now already?

910
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,080
And my choice for this week is actually going to be an old kind of dating myself here.

911
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,680
Uh, yeah, it's the phone call from the 80s, giving me my picture this week.

912
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,680
And I like phones.

913
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,680
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, I know that phone. Yeah.

914
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,680
And the girl!

915
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,680
Oh, yeah. Anyway.

916
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,680
Anyway. Yeah.

917
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,680
That's a good phone. That's a good choice.

918
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,280
Because, I don't know. I kind of hear it as the 2DX song.

919
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,080
Oh, yeah. I know. That's a good choice.

920
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,280
But it's very... it fits, you know, perfectly.

921
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,680
What song do you think should be in a Hermione game? What Hermione game was?

922
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:46,180
Well, I chose, uh, something for 2Dx, or, you know, 3A, and I chose a song called You're Not Alone by Ollie's that nobody knows that song.

923
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,180
I know that song.

924
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,180
Yeah, and nobody else.

925
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,180
Yeah.

926
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:54,180
Which is okay, and, yeah, like, nobody knows that song, but it's a good song.

927
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,180
It's just, it's huge.

928
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,680
Why do you think this song should be in the air?

929
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,180
Because it's a good song.

930
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:04,180
I think it fits perfectly, um, that song.

931
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,280
So I'm playing it all over again.

932
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,340
Yeah, I know you have to play 17th.

933
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,400
Well, I know that I'm really out there as well.

934
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,400
Yeah, I know.

935
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,000
Well, I think you have to how to understand.

936
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,540
I'm using all of your vowels to me.

937
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:23,540
Yeah, I think so.

938
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,200
I'm using some of your own.

939
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,500
Something.

940
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,040
I think that kind of genre is it?

941
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,100
Like five vowels.

942
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,600
Cool.

943
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,100
Cool.

944
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,600
I think so.

945
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,600
Where are you at?

946
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,100
What song?

947
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,160
Okay, I just played the

948
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,160
I played the three days last night, but

949
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
the one I got wanted

950
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,160
you can have your crystal left more than you

951
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
but crystal left the phone

952
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
and all

953
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
sorry what was it?

954
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,160
name of the game, yeah

955
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,160
that should be a TX, but

956
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,160
if there was any song I wanted to hear

957
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
that would be the one

958
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,160
and that's just perfect

959
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,160
except like all of it

960
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
scratching along with

961
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,160
just some radio

962
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,160
sounds that look like a tack song

963
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,160
or something like that

964
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,160
I don't know if you want to play that

965
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
for the audience or not

966
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,160
I'm going to pull up my lap

967
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,160
lets see

968
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:07,160
Let's get on my computer here. It's in the directory there.

969
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,160
This makes for a wonderful way. Anything else you want to say about the song?

970
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,160
Which, what was it called again?

971
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,160
Uh, name of the game. Name of the game.

972
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,160
Uh, anything else you want to say about it?

973
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,160
It's good.

974
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,160
Oh, and it's kind of like, uh, Star Wars.

975
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:35,040
cracking up

976
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,460
What's that number on you want

977
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,140
the money you want

978
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,820
Actually one more difference

979
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,600
is the T.R.A.N.C.E.

980
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,720
or what they call it

981
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,720
Uh, what was it?

982
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,320
It's Amber Buffenbyard by, uh, Amy Hamasaki.

983
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,920
I, yeah, nobody, nobody in the video asked me if you've ever heard of Amy Hamasaki.

984
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,920
Uh, whatever, I don't care.

985
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,920
You see, you think Amber should be at the, uh, uh, Amber Buffenbyard.

986
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,920
Amber Buffenbyard.

987
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
I'm so happy to have her.

988
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,840
But anyway, I can totally see this in the video.

989
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,320
You know, when there are fans that are here behind them, that's kind of...

990
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:35,000
Actually, you know, I've been always covering most of the, uh, cover songs, such as the Netflix movie, uh...

991
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,360
Uh, naturally, we'd love to be able to explore the options.

992
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,120
I have, like, almost every song with a listener.

993
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,280
Yeah, actually. Cool, cool.

994
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,360
What about you, Paul? What song?

995
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:54,360
This one's kind of popular, it's kind of funny, it's a popular one kind of dog, and it's really, really good old.

996
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,360
It's really weird, and it's when people find me up front.

997
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,360
It's called a butterfly.

998
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,360
It's a little band called Smile!

999
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,360
And I think it'll be so cool.

1000
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,360
Five minutes ago called.

1001
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:14,360
Is this on VDR? I just wasn't born, I guess, before that one.

1002
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,360
No, I didn't.

1003
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:22,360
If I came out, you know, only a couple of years ago, I knew like several years ago, that I was going to bed.

1004
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,360
I don't care.

1005
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
The age of 13.

1006
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,360
Yeah.

1007
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
You know what I'm saying?

1008
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
You know what I'm saying?

1009
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,360
Baby got fat.

1010
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,360
Isn't that on the King of the Hill thing when they get the ER parity on TV now?

1011
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Yeah, but hey, if there's a one-hit wonder in this world, it's baby got fat.

1012
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360
Sure mix floss is pretty popular.

1013
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
Hold on.

1014
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,360
Wait.

1015
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Why is that a mix floss?

1016
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,360
I, I, the only other sure mix floss song I remember is, uh,

1017
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,360
Put It Up On It, Jump On It, or something like that.

1018
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,360
Put It Up On It?

1019
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,360
What?

1020
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,360
Am I the only one listening to that?

1021
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,360
I know you did, Rob.

1022
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,360
Yeah, but I didn't listen to crap.

1023
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,360
Squirt of that crap?

1024
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,360
Yeah, I didn't say it.

1025
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,360
All I did was say it.

1026
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,360
I didn't listen to shit.

1027
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,360
But that was in the 90s.

1028
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,360
No, in the 80s?

1029
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,360
I'm sorry.

1030
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,360
In the 80s, it was all about porn.

1031
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,360
I know, right?

1032
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,360
Oh, well I should call that girl, it's like 1990, but anyway, who's counting?

1033
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,360
Is anybody else? Oh, look out there!

1034
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,360
Get, get there!

1035
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,360
Hang on the other row.

1036
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,360
Hey, you guys!

1037
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,360
Baby?

1038
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,360
Baby?

1039
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
Oh, look at that ball in there.

1040
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,360
Rocky?

1041
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,360
Really?

1042
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:36,360
We want to hear what you guys think is, uh, should be in the money that's not already in the money.

1043
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,360
Yeah, who wants to go?

1044
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,360
Why don't you go over there?

1045
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,360
Alright, well I think it should be the new D.E.R. song or something like that.

1046
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:47,360
And it should be Baby Box's Love and Ecstasy.

1047
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,360
And why?

1048
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,360
Because when they first started I thought it was the D.E.R. song

1049
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,360
and I was like, oh it's not a D.E.R. song, okay bye.

1050
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,360
Wonderful, thank you!

1051
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,360
Hey, hey, alright, there you go, what's your choice?

1052
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,360
I think it should be, uh, I don't know, I can't touch it.

1053
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,360
I need to pump it up.

1054
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,360
I need to pump it up.

1055
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,360
He has all the crappy songs going to pump it up right now.

1056
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,360
No.

1057
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,360
I'm going to have to.

1058
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,360
I'm going to have to.

1059
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,360
I'm going to have to.

1060
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,360
Freaky?

1061
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,360
You're going to find freaky?

1062
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,360
No.

1063
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,360
Because I'm freaky.

1064
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,360
It's kind of white.

1065
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
You can't match it.

1066
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,360
Yeah.

1067
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,360
Super freaky.

1068
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,360
Super freaky.

1069
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,360
Yeah.

1070
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,360
So that's disqualified.

1071
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,360
They don't give a damn about the show.

1072
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,360
He just wants to show up.

1073
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,360
Yeah.

1074
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,360
Go to the page.

1075
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,360
Bring me a phone.

1076
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:38,360
We're getting a suggestion from the chat room that, uh, in 2DX would be anything by that violinist trance shit.

1077
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,360
And I think you would be referencing, uh, Vanessa May.

1078
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,360
Who, uh, is, is in a rotation right now on her spaceship.

1079
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,360
She has a song called Destiny off the Fantasia album.

1080
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,360
And, uh, this would be a great time to do that for me.

1081
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,360
Good, good.

1082
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,360
Vanessa May has tons and tons of stuff.

1083
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,560
And Jamie, Jamie's a big fan of the nuts and they should go off for a long, long time.

1084
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:10,560
Actually, if my memory serves me correctly, I believe that, um, uh, that, uh, the monitor would actually just need a plant for that one.

1085
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,360
Oh, that one!

1086
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,360
I, I believe, I, I believe that.

1087
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,760
So if you can't get them in the real money games, you gotta take the emulation.

1088
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,360
Um, oh yes. I think I'm pushing the 100-some mark.

1089
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,360
Oh, actually, you're probably about right. Yeah, 1000.

1090
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:43,360
Well, I'm at 769 or something, are you talking about your own little collection you have on your computer that just basically you're trying to compile every set of fan made sets that are out there, and official ones, and stuff like that, maybe?

1091
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Okay, we also need to make more thin irons and rods in the sun.

1092
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,360
Can I have this outside?

1093
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,360
Yeah, sure.

1094
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,360
Another one that's pretty cool.

1095
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Another one is called Duck Toy.

1096
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
I don't know.

1097
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,360
That's by Heiferberg.

1098
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,360
It's like that rape song.

1099
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
I don't know.

1100
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,360
They're the era.

1101
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,360
Big, cool, fat neck.

1102
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360
That needs to be seen here.

1103
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,360
That's also my station on the station right now.

1104
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,360
We decided we'd throw it in some, uh, they're kinda related to Bemani, but not really things.

1105
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,360
So we have some remixes in there.

1106
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
Cause people kinda get sick of the sound.

1107
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,360
I'm working on it.

1108
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,360
This is...

1109
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Did you come in a file?

1110
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Did you come in a file?

1111
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,360
Yeah, I did a video.

1112
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,360
Any other news in the community right now?

1113
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
Innovation-wise?

1114
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Innovation-wise, uh, the melting pot's down because T-viral slides down.

1115
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Actually, this is a file now that, uh, dderaniac.net's pulling the, uh, nerf for, uh,

1116
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,360
for a guest that's eventually seen to actually use a file converter and download the program again.

1117
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Um, it's probably all going to come up tomorrow since that's when the month is up,

1118
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,360
and, you know, the bandwidth is probably gone.

1119
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
Right, right. Cool.

1120
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Alright, um, what do you think, are you just sticking to the break?

1121
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,360
Are any of the songs you ever want to add, or?

1122
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,360
No, I think they're still good for now.

1123
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,360
Oh, they're coming up.

1124
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,360
But that's not a trap.

1125
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,360
You know what would be a great time of the year?

1126
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:07,360
The

1127
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,360
The

1128
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,360
The

1129
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,360
The

1130
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,360
The

1131
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,360
The

1132
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,360
The

1133
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
The

1134
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
The

1135
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,360
The

1136
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
The

1137
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,360
The

1138
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,360
The

1139
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,360
The

1140
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,360
You know what everybody would be saying if you started parrying to that song?

1141
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
Are you playing?

1142
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:49,360
Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more madness here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1143
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:56,360
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1144
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,360
Yay!

1145
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,360
Yay!

1146
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,360
Yay!

1147
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,360
Yay!

1148
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,360
Yay!

1149
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,360
Yay!

1150
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Nooooooo!

1151
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,360
Are you sure you want me to do this?

1152
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,360
Nooooo!

1153
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,360
Are you sure you want me to do this?

1154
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,360
Nooooo!

1155
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,360
Nooooo!

1156
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,360
Extreme of Bonnie Radio.

1157
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,360
That's us! Orange Lounge Radio.

1158
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,360
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1159
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,360
Episode number two. Here we are.

1160
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,360
And umm...

1161
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,360
Matt wanted to get in on the fun.

1162
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,360
Earlier we were doing the app.

1163
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
He was a wee kind of trying to fill in for Jamie.

1164
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,360
Absolutely she bought the anime so she was able to do it at the early age.

1165
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:41,360
So we had one for her and Matt also wanted to give in and she had a little bit of a rant that he wanted to say.

1166
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:46,360
Yeah, so my rant would be for those people that like to cut through a machine.

1167
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Namely, Perper and Ciara.

1168
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,360
Perper, I always have people walking too close to me and I look bad to any of them and that kind of thing.

1169
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,360
Really, I don't care because they're dumb enough to walk that close.

1170
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,360
I really don't care about hitting them.

1171
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,000
by hitting them, but then you get pissed off when they get hit, because they're watching too close.

1172
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,360
And I actually touched this today, I said in the middle of a pair of pair of machines,

1173
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,560
they'll suck my arm out, and then actually, it's inside the machine,

1174
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,120
so these people are watching way too close to the machine.

1175
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,160
And, um, I hate them. I don't feel bad.

1176
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,080
Hehehe, I'm over here, that's a good way to sum it up.

1177
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:24,240
Um, that pisses me off too when people do that on DVR, and little kids do this all the time.

1178
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:30,240
You'll be up there dancing, doing your thing, and then suddenly you know how there's that little space between where the machine is and where the pad is?

1179
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,240
A little kid decides that's the fastest way for them to go.

1180
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,240
So they'll run right between you and the machine when you're trying to play.

1181
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,240
Like when you're in the nose and on any course or something, they just run right through the machine.

1182
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,240
What the hell is that?

1183
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,240
It's a little kid.

1184
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,240
I gotta say though, ever since...

1185
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,240
Bad parenting.

1186
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:56,240
Um, what girlfriend did a little while ago is they took these little wooden platforms and kind of stuck them in between the machine and the pads.

1187
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Which actually I think really helped that because now little kids if they want to do that have to take a step off.

1188
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,240
And I think most little kids are too lazy to do that so they throw around now.

1189
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
So I guess problem solved in some aspects.

1190
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:11,240
But now Para Para seems like it needs some kind of mote built around it or something.

1191
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,540
Seriously I couldn't hit most guy in the head.

1192
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:17,140
He was like uh, uh, bad.

1193
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,640
You were hitting a guy in the head?

1194
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,740
Oh ok. He was standing there at 4 feet tall.

1195
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,740
He was bending over and helping O2 with the super machine.

1196
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:29,240
And you know he was like the mad guy sitting on the guy you know now.

1197
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,240
Because he's just.

1198
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,240
And he's just sitting there.

1199
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,740
You wanna share on the show?

1200
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,240
Haha.

1201
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,740
I was playing it.

1202
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,740
Oh yeah you were playing it.

1203
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,740
I was playing Para Para Para.

1204
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,240
About 2 or 3 people were at me.

1205
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:47,240
I really don't care, you know, but actually there's this one guy who had been standing there and just like trying to piss me off, you know.

1206
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,240
He's like, what are you doing? I'm like, you might want to move back, but you don't want to be hit.

1207
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,240
So he just stands there and finally he walks away.

1208
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:59,240
He walks by, and as he walks by, I just haven't been put my hand out, and this backhand had done pretty well.

1209
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,240
It was pretty cool.

1210
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,240
Any suggestions on how ball fighting can fix this problem?

1211
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Yeah.

1212
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,240
Oh well, there's no...

1213
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,240
There's no way to fix this problem.

1214
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:16,240
Um, just, you know, people need to watch where they're walking. I don't watch in front, I mean, especially like mocaps, I mean, like watching a cell phone play mocap boxing.

1215
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:19,240
I mean, you don't want to be in there if you don't watch in front of people.

1216
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
Nah, that's the key issue.

1217
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,240
Um, they can also really love all these practical solutions your dad's come up with.

1218
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,240
Rearrange the game, and you can't really just get out of the kitchen, John.

1219
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:33,240
I agree with, I agree with you. They should definitely rearrange the game since mocaps aren't working.

1220
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,240
We're not supposed to put that there, instead, it's a pair of terrible mocaps.

1221
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:46,240
That's a good idea. But the thing about, um, why they put hair here in the yarn stuff in the area that they do is because there's arches and they cannot fit through the arches.

1222
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,240
I mean, I don't know why they don't get so close, I guess, right now.

1223
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,240
Cause it was, it's...

1224
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,240
That's too great, that. That's okay.

1225
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,240
They're so very cute.

1226
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,240
Oh, they are.

1227
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
I don't know. This is what they're saying.

1228
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,240
But that's why they keep them in that central area when you first walk.

1229
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,240
Oh, okay.

1230
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
Well, I'm, I don't know.

1231
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,240
Nobody cuts through that.

1232
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
Nobody cuts through sumo.

1233
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
Okay, I can't cut through my sumo.

1234
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
Heh heh heh.

1235
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
Yeah, you know what?

1236
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:17,240
I've made the differ. I think sumo is a very gay game.

1237
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
I mean you get this big red ball that people are sitting in.

1238
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
It's somewhat fashionable.

1239
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,240
Fashionable? Fashionable.

1240
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,240
Uh huh.

1241
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,240
Where is Shimon? Anyway, he should be on the show.

1242
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Should I just unplug my camera? I hope not.

1243
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,240
Sweetie, make sure you have some water.

1244
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Sweetie, look at this, it just looks so weird.

1245
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,240
Oh!

1246
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,240
Ok, let's do it.

1247
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,240
14.

1248
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,240
When I open it up.

1249
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,240
10.

1250
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,240
15.

1251
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,240
16.

1252
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,240
17.

1253
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,240
18.

1254
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,240
19.

1255
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,240
20.

1256
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,240
21.

1257
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,240
21.

1258
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,240
22.

1259
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,240
23.

1260
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,240
24.

1261
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,240
25.

1262
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,240
26.

1263
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,240
27.

1264
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,240
28.

1265
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,240
29.

1266
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,240
30.

1267
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,240
31.

1268
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,240
32.

1269
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,240
33.

1270
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,240
34.

1271
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,240
35.

1272
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:08,240
Well, there was these cavemen, and they were like bouncing up and down behind me, saying that they were, you know,

1273
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:16,240
but I was mad because I was moving, but I was asking the other world without thinking anything of their type of name,

1274
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,240
and so I said, you live by an Alice!

1275
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,240
I don't know.

1276
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:25,240
But I didn't say anything. I just, well, I just stuck my finger out of it and happened to be the middle finger,

1277
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:29,240
and he said, oh, you can't put me out.

1278
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:32,040
But I didn't begin, and he said,

1279
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,040
Hey, if you do it again, I'm going to just grab something.

1280
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,040
So I didn't begin, and I said,

1281
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Fuck off, I'm going to get the security if you even try to do anything with me.

1282
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Yeah, he ran away. I ran.

1283
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:46,040
Yeah, exactly.

1284
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,040
But you know what?

1285
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,040
Two hours later, when I'm leaving the park,

1286
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,040
they're out there waiting for me.

1287
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,040
I mean, I guess they were that into it

1288
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,040
that they went way out of the park in like two hours

1289
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
for me to come out.

1290
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:14,040
They didn't do anything. But I guess you only get four or five guys together and it's like, oh, it's only one guy, so, you know, what is it? Strength in numbers or something like that?

1291
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
Yeah.

1292
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,040
Yeah, that really works, right?

1293
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,040
Say hello to George, strength in numbers.

1294
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,040
Yeah.

1295
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:29,040
I have never been officially a joy addict growing up.

1296
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Well, actually I think the problem has kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.

1297
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,040
I remember I used to be playing on USA Mix and stuff back when we had forest, you know,

1298
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,040
and just swapping out for that.

1299
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,040
I wish all of them had kind of gotten better as far as people mocking me.

1300
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:53,040
I remember I used to be playing on, um, USA Mix and stuff back when we had fourth, you know, and just swapping off of that.

1301
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:58,040
And I actually had, you know, a little kid try to pick fights with me.

1302
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:03,040
For no reason! I was just playing the game and they just come up and try to pick a fight with me.

1303
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,040
You know, I just hit your ass. I'm like, that's, uh, where the hell did you come from?

1304
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,040
And, um, first night, you know, Eric was there, and then I was like,

1305
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,040
So, what the hell? What's your tune?

1306
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
And he's like, so you and I are trapped here.

1307
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,040
And he's like, dude, now where'd you find this guy?

1308
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,040
He's just away.

1309
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,040
And the other night, Canada was like, trapped here, basically.

1310
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

1311
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,040
But I have it right now.

1312
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,040
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you only see six months we love.

1313
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,040
Exactly.

1314
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,040
But I mean, I haven't had any kids in such advice with me.

1315
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,040
Especially little kids.

1316
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,040
That happens all the time. I mean, seriously.

1317
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,640
Remember that one kid?

1318
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,240
Hey Brad, you were kind of cracking.

1319
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,960
He said, remember that he ever cracked kids?

1320
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,640
Everybody did, he did, he did.

1321
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,680
Yeah, remember that one kid?

1322
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,520
Remember that one kid?

1323
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,640
Remember he was making fun of any of you?

1324
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,840
Yes, because I remember every child that he had.

1325
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:59,200
Yeah, and then he goes and plays on TV and we throw up behind him and we see the crowd.

1326
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,080
What a little shit.

1327
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,600
I mean, he is kind of me.

1328
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,600
And then we all kind of go away because we found something more interesting to play for five minutes.

1329
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,600
I mean, when I say we all, it means it was like five, six, seven of us.

1330
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,600
And then this little kid, when we're not looking, gets on the machine and starts playing as if we're not gonna do it.

1331
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:19,600
And everyone's like, we got up, we all got up there and started cheering him on going, yeah, go, da da da.

1332
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,600
And then he failed the song and he ran to the bathroom and cried.

1333
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,600
And then I'm like, you're so awesome, I want your kid.

1334
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
And then that was it.

1335
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:34,600
I think the worst thing that ever happened, or not really the worst, but actually probably the most recent, was playing a machine.

1336
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,600
I had this guy, and they were just like standing there kind of mocking me,

1337
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:43,600
and jump up, right in front of me with the camera, flash, and then jump off the machine.

1338
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,600
And he did that twice. I had people like, I had this black guy, you know, standing there,

1339
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,600
and he goes, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

1340
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,600
Then him and his friend came up, and they were like pretending to freak me,

1341
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,000
And she was like, what the hell are you guys doing?

1342
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,600
I just thought you were a cool asshole.

1343
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,400
Yeah, you know, I do.

1344
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,000
Why didn't you jump on that shit, right?

1345
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You're like, oh, right there, sis.

1346
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Oh, oh, yeah.

1347
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1348
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,400
Couldn't have found something.

1349
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,000
I hope this is not my apartment.

1350
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,600
No, you know, that's a reference to a movie.

1351
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,400
I'm not racist.

1352
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,600
Yeah, I think so.

1353
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,600
Yeah.

1354
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,800
Aw.

1355
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,600
You're racist.

1356
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,400
You're racist then.

1357
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:17,800
You gotta finish.

1358
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,600
You gotta finish.

1359
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,200
Uh, you know, that reminds me of, uh, an earlier incident

1360
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,200
I had online with people.

1361
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,200
The tenant took me away from me.

1362
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,200
What did he do to that?

1363
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,200
I sent her a name on my face.

1364
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,200
I said, Jamie, that's your guy's office.

1365
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,200
She's like, oh yes, that's my guy's office.

1366
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
I told her, I sent her a name.

1367
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,200
That one must be a quarter black.

1368
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,200
I'm the new pal.

1369
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,200
My friend's a gourmet.

1370
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,200
I was just talking about it, but I didn't think it was gonna be that bad.

1371
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,200
They were saying you were a quarter black,

1372
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,200
or they were saying Jamie was a quarter black.

1373
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,200
She's like, you're a gourmet.

1374
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,200
Are you a quarter-block?

1375
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,200
Oh, I'm a quarter-block.

1376
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
Okay.

1377
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,200
Okay, yeah.

1378
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,200
Anyway, let's change topic now.

1379
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,200
I got physically removed by somebody from the machine.

1380
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,200
How do you get physically removed?

1381
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:10,200
No, I came up onto the stage and grabbed me and threw me off the machine.

1382
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,200
I was secretly assaulted on the machine.

1383
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,200
Were you number eight on the computer machine?

1384
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:42,200
I was like, yeah, you don't want to start eating with me because I'm white, that's Jimmy.

1385
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:50,200
Yeah. I could shoot you with my legs if you do. Really.

1386
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:56,200
That is brought with him to the show this week. A lovely VCD.

1387
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,200
You explain what the hell this is like. I still haven't figured it out.

1388
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,200
Yeah, I watched it and it's just one show and I still haven't figured it out.

1389
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:08,200
Um, actually what this is, it's a VCD, a classic VCD.

1390
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,200
We've got one that's called Para Para Dance and one that's Para Para Stadium.

1391
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,200
Everyone knows what Para Para Stadium is.

1392
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:20,200
It's just Para Para All Stars doing new routines for different Para songs so you can learn them.

1393
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:27,200
But the first CD Para Para Dance is a bunch of different clips from this one variety show that's actually on TV.

1394
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:31,200
It's starring Takura Kimura.

1395
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,200
And, um, this guy, that's it.

1396
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,200
Yeah, that's, I believe it's Paku Ya, Paku Ya Tamera.

1397
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,200
Just kidding. Alright, that's, that's it.

1398
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Anyways, what this guy is, is he's a singer and actor from Japan who, in the 90s,

1399
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:51,200
um, started doing pairs on TV and actually kind of made it popular again.

1400
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,200
And so we've got a clip of him, because this guy, he plays a character called Bucky Tamera.

1401
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Now we have to remember that this is radio and the audience can't see what we're playing.

1402
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:06,200
So here you can see a war blind, and it's on a giant monitor here, but we kind of have to do the best we can to make this radio friendly segment, so you might have to explain what's going on.

1403
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:13,200
Okay, well basically, the scene starts off, it's kind of hanging by a couple windows, and you see what looks like kind of a dance class.

1404
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,200
They have people doing pare pares and stuff like that.

1405
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:27,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm starting out, they have a class that actually shows these people with, uh, almost looks like springs on their arms that actually, you know, kind of like those muscle springs to, uh, shrinking arms.

1406
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,200
I don't like buns or steel, that sort of thing.

1407
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,200
Yeah, that kind of thing.

1408
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:35,700
Anyways, um, let's just start off with them, and do this, and I'll kind of, uh, narrate this as it's going along.

1409
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:36,700
So here we go.

1410
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,700
And, you have to spin it.

1411
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,200
And we need the volume.

1412
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:53,200
Okay, so it basically seems to get faster and faster, kind of seeing what's going on here, in a ridiculous fashion.

1413
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,400
This is useful.

1414
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,600
Yes, it's Japanese 2-piece ball.

1415
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,400
And it springs your brain dramatically.

1416
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,400
It can be as if you must do it.

1417
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,800
And now enters Bucky.

1418
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,000
This game song is a matter of fact.

1419
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,200
And I'm showing a statue of him, a box of him.

1420
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,600
And out he comes.

1421
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:31,600
With iron power duster, with Mr. White everywhere it stops, and now he's going to do a password, turn the gear.

1422
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,600
Which I like that I like it so I think it's awesome.

1423
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,600
Now, who's this guy? I don't know what happened.

1424
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Here he goes. Oh yeah.

1425
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,600
It's a type of party.

1426
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,600
It's a type of party.

1427
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,600
That's the one. He's my idol.

1428
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,600
Yeah, how come he looks cool and neat after an hour and a half?

1429
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,600
I'm the only person he knows how cool he is.

1430
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,600
No, no, I think I figured it out.

1431
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,600
Check it out. It is cool because it has fifty-five Asian women behind it.

1432
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,600
That's fun.

1433
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,600
Anyways, this is pretty much the normal part of the video.

1434
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Him doing the three pees.

1435
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,600
He's just got a lot of style. He just is very cool.

1436
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,600
Squash!

1437
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,600
And now it's just really good to him.

1438
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,600
It's doing him perfecting his technique.

1439
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
His end pose as you might say.

1440
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,600
Now he's doing it again.

1441
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,600
It's a Kung Fu Hara Hara movie.

1442
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,600
And there's like lasers.

1443
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,600
And he's poking...he's poking past lasers.

1444
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,600
He's got people cramming him down his arms and stuff.

1445
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,600
He looks like Dax right there.

1446
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,600
And now he's going to do the traditional Kung Fu thing with the tanto and the ritat.

1447
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,600
And blue channeled.

1448
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,600
And he's still dancing.

1449
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,600
In the classroom I like to whip up a disco like that when we're out of nowhere.

1450
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:15,600
And now as we're stopping, he's ripping off his shirt and under his shirt he's got a prank.

1451
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,600
They're putting the metal things on him.

1452
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,600
And they're taking his pranks off.

1453
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,600
They're taking them off.

1454
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:29,600
And now he summons for his assistant, some hot aging shit, and here he goes.

1455
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,600
Oh, and his final move. And this dress comes off.

1456
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,600
And everyone chews because it's so stupid.

1457
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,600
All the Asian women cheer because they have to see a panty shot right there. Marilyn Monroe and all the Marilyn Monroe.

1458
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,600
Alright. Let's do one more question. Any more of this crap?

1459
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,600
Um, yeah, worst radio ever, guys. The worst radio.

1460
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,600
Okay.

1461
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:03,600
I don't know. We're being experimental, banner, so let's give our own answer and get our few devices up in the air.

1462
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
Maybe we can put some, uh, still images on.

1463
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,600
One that I later made.

1464
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,600
Yeah, you can rip some of this, like, and then put this on the side.

1465
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,600
Oh, definitely. You know, I mean, what is this?

1466
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:20,600
And now we are going to have the screen inside of a club and there is some J-Pop singer who I have no idea who it is.

1467
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:25,600
And the screen appears to be some sort of cover as it heats you up.

1468
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:36,600
And he comes out doing his night of fire bit.

1469
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:53,600
And there's the assistant raising all his face, kind of like Phantom of the Opera, or Phantom of the Para-para.

1470
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,600
Phantom of the Para, guys.

1471
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:06,600
And he loves their micro-friends right here for no apparent reason. I don't know why.

1472
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,600
And then he walks away.

1473
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,600
So then he's gonna...

1474
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,600
He's gonna pose and the camera's pretty.

1475
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,600
And he's doing another turn.

1476
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,600
Okay. One more here.

1477
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:36,600
I got a song right here, it is called Dancy Miro, it's a Japanese cover of U2Up.

1478
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:40,600
Interesting, very interesting.

1479
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:45,600
Ok, and if you want to comment on what horrible radio this makes, you can join our chatroom,

1480
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:52,600
it's Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.APEX.ORG, which you can put right into your MIRC server.

1481
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,600
Oh, this is a pretty recording. That was the old people, wasn't it?

1482
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,600
This is pretty recording.

1483
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,600
Old people are funny. Let's see what this is.

1484
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,600
There he is.

1485
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,600
This is great. You're going to love this one.

1486
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,600
And there's old people playing troté.

1487
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,600
And there's a guy in a coat that you can't see his face. See?

1488
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,600
And that's a Smith's trademark whistle there.

1489
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,460
typing sounds

1490
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,920
He is fine, I'mall Sr oranges

1491
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,160
I'll get out of here while I err

1492
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,020
Buy some of that

1493
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,140
It's spirit

1494
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,120
cross

1495
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,380
And all of the sudden the explorer becomes

1496
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,500
He's468 in the yard

1497
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,820
And he's filling all the fire

1498
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:39,320
again

1499
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:50,320
And he's saying people aren't dancing, and they're staring at him like a nut.

1500
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:55,320
And the old guy recognizes him as Bucky.

1501
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:06,320
And so he's going to put in a tape that the old people can dance to.

1502
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,120
Oh, I see, because all people don't listen to E.V.E.'s tunes.

1503
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:11,320
It's the...

1504
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,720
...Might of Fire uppers version.

1505
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,920
Oh, wow!

1506
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:18,920
It's a child!

1507
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:19,420
Wow!

1508
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,720
Nothing is more funny than watching a bunch of old people carry a toy.

1509
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:39,720
Now the people on the penis golf plan, this is what they're going to look like in 50 years.

1510
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,720
This is the penis golf plan in 50 years.

1511
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,720
And it's senior night on fire!

1512
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:52,720
Alright everybody give a big hand for Matt and his crappy parody series.

1513
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
I said hello!

1514
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:00,720
We're getting a comment saying this is sad.

1515
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:11,720
All right, that about sums it up. I hope that helps. We're going to go ahead and take one more quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap it all up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1516
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:54,000
Don't mind what you say, baby Don't mind what you say, baby

1517
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Open up, what are you doing?

1518
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Let's dig in!

1519
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Oh

1520
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I want it all

1521
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Let me hear you say

1522
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I want it all

1523
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Is that what you call that?

1524
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I want it all

1525
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Let me hear you say

1526
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I want it all

1527
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I want it all

1528
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
You need to bring the beat back

1529
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Oh

1530
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
We often wonder how some of those bimani songs are chosen.

1531
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder!

1532
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
We think we figured it out. Orange Lounge Radio.

1533
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, just about at the end of our second show.

1534
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I am your host, Rock Roberts. You might know me as Skye.

1535
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers is not here this week because she's at Anime Expo.

1536
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
So fill me in and see lovely Irene the Rice Princess.

1537
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And no wedding.

1538
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And of course we also have in studio many, many guests.

1539
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And I'd like to thank all you guys for coming this week.

1540
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
As you did last week, we've got Matt, we've got Paul, we've got Brad, we've got Bradley

1541
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
who doesn't say anything but he gives moral support.

1542
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,140
And the other room we got going on and Dave is coming in the room right now.

1543
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:02,480
Um, I guess I thought I'd ask you guys at the end of the show, but I really should ask you guys at the beginning of the show, how was your week?

1544
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:08,880
And, any, anything exciting going this week? Or, anything you want to talk about openly on the radio?

1545
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,880
I work out the parking area.

1546
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,880
Parking? Freakin' Roseville and sun splash parking.

1547
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,480
Their whole parking lot was full.

1548
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,480
Parking across the street was full.

1549
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:22,400
If you wanted to get through the sun splash, you would try to run a parking lot fast and narrow like I did.

1550
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,400
Or you go park across the street at the hotel, which probably also was full.

1551
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,400
Wow.

1552
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,400
What was something going on there today?

1553
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,400
Yeah, it's called the water sky.

1554
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,400
There's a drawback with having a big, you know, nice park like us.

1555
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,400
And since we have a water park, it's always busy.

1556
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,400
You can't find parking spaces during the, you know, summertime.

1557
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:45,400
And there's going to be tons of people in their swimsuits dripping water all over the pads.

1558
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,400
They have tons of hot chicks in between these halls.

1559
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,400
I don't go there to look at hot chicks. I go there to play DVR.

1560
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:57,400
I can go online and look up Asian porn if I want to see how shit I don't need to go.

1561
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
Shush! You do it too!

1562
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,400
Not for you!

1563
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,400
My old nail school was really involved by then.

1564
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,400
I knew it was me, but Judy, I found a beauty in it.

1565
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,400
What about it?

1566
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,400
It was an apron!

1567
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,400
Oh, you got a secret, man.

1568
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,400
I need to do a TV show.

1569
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,400
I know right? Nobody listens to the show. It's okay.

1570
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,400
I know. I don't get arrested.

1571
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:25,400
Look right there! You're all listeners. What do you know?

1572
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,400
Um.

1573
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,400
Oh yeah. Oh yeah the police are listening. What do you know?

1574
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,400
I had time off work this week thank god.

1575
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,400
Um and I basically spent my time

1576
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,400
sitting at home playing old school video games

1577
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,400
because I discovered that

1578
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,400
my greatest use for the Dreamcast

1579
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,400
is to burn old Nintendo games

1580
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,400
and display them on the Dreamcast.

1581
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,400
I don't think we did this ever again.

1582
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,400
Not like that!

1583
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,400
We're going on a sea-watch island.

1584
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,400
Arrrrr!

1585
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,400
I don't know why I'm here.

1586
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,400
I don't know why.

1587
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,400
I know why.

1588
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,400
We...just...I'm already around here.

1589
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,400
Sorry.

1590
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,400
Shut up!

1591
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,400
Whoever.

1592
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,400
I know.

1593
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,400
I know.

1594
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,400
I know.

1595
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,400
I know.

1596
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,400
My doggy caught a mix.

1597
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:02,400
Yeah!

1598
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,400
I know!

1599
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:04,400
I know!

1600
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,400
Yes!

1601
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,400
And I discovered...I rediscovered my life as a guardian legend.

1602
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,400
The old 8-bit Nintendo game which was half shooter, half legend of Zelda.

1603
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,400
Oh yeah.

1604
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,400
I love that game so much.

1605
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,400
If they ever made a sequel to the guardian legend I think I'd quit the game.

1606
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,400
I love that game so much. If you ever made a sequel to The Guardian Watch, you might think I've quit the game.

1607
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,400
Yeah!

1608
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,400
Are you too busy playing The Guardian Watch?

1609
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,400
Excuse me, I came back. I've quit the game.

1610
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,400
What old school video game would have to come back for you guys to quit the game?

1611
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,400
For me?

1612
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,400
Um...at it.

1613
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,400
What good old school game?

1614
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,400
I don't know necessarily what you quit the game at.

1615
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,400
What are some good old school games that need to come back?

1616
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,400
Um...

1617
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,400
Oh, you know what's coming after, huh? Oh yeah, we're going to come.

1618
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,400
Rhydar! We're making rhydar!

1619
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,400
Are we? Yeah!

1620
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,400
What?

1621
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,400
Ninja Diamond!

1622
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,400
Shinobi!

1623
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,400
And of course, we got a common at some point.

1624
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,400
Wario Kart.

1625
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,400
Oh yeah.

1626
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,400
Are these the things that Mario's coming into?

1627
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,400
Oh, right on.

1628
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,400
We're going to make a very sweet matter.

1629
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,400
I don't know.

1630
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
And that's always the game that gets me to buy the system.

1631
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,400
So once they've made it, they've sold themselves another game too.

1632
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
I'm not ready for this.

1633
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:09,400
I just got 26th already and it finally comes out.

1634
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,400
I'm not ready.

1635
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,400
I'm going to the old school game.

1636
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,400
What's the game two?

1637
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,400
Come on.

1638
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,400
I want me too.

1639
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
That's my two.

1640
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,400
That's my two.

1641
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,400
Yeah.

1642
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,400
We can finally shoot that fucking dog.

1643
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,400
Yes, exactly.

1644
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,400
The dog's revenge.

1645
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,400
What the dog?

1646
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:30,400
I want you to play.

1647
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,400
What? There's a Goonies 3?

1648
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,400
No, they're making a Goonies 2 movie.

1649
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
It's actually going to be a good series.

1650
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
There was a Goonies 2 video game.

1651
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,400
The first one was released.

1652
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
The Goonies 2 was a video game.

1653
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
I mean, what about Goonies 3?

1654
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
I mean, any of them.

1655
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,400
Was there another Cyndi Lauper remix?

1656
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,400
Like, how?

1657
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,400
No.

1658
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,400
And they did it, like, since we were here that night.

1659
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,400
You know, I don't know.

1660
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,400
All graphic, and then they did a challenge.

1661
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:04,400
I can show you why she has a little like, circle trail following behind them, but it's really nice to spend time with them.

1662
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,400
Baby? Baby, you've got Crossy Road! Crossy Road?

1663
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,400
I know you all seem to be a really great drug policy agent.

1664
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,400
Oh, for what?

1665
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,400
That will never, ever happen.

1666
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:23,400
Well, you know, they're actually, uh, I know they have written, uh, the Japan stuff, but they're actually making a lot of action.

1667
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:24,400
Definitely, really.

1668
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:29,920
If there's a Dragon Ball V game, every level, we just go over the last level for like, 3 paths.

1669
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:38,160
There's like one little bit where you like jump on a square, and then it would just like, reach half a level off level, and then on the next episode of...

1670
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:41,040
How about Quirks, the video game? Do they have that yet?

1671
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,400
No, but that'd be awesome!

1672
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,560
That would be awesome, but what would you do if you just...

1673
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,600
You wouldn't do it!

1674
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,320
You're customers!

1675
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,280
It's like, it's a quiz!

1676
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,280
It's a quiz! Are you supposed to be here today?

1677
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,280
Yes, of course not.

1678
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,920
I knew it that time! In the bathroom!

1679
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:56,460
Uh, did you learn some form?

1680
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,460
Um...no?

1681
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,460
Is that sort of the game thing?

1682
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:02,460
No...are you sure?

1683
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,460
Yeah!

1684
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,460
We're just hoping you guys will see us later.

1685
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:08,460
Rooftop hockey is the ultimate sports game!

1686
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:10,460
Quirks presents Rooftop Hockey on the Xbox!

1687
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,460
The ultimate sports game!

1688
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,460
That would be cool!

1689
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:15,460
Go ahead and pass us, you...you suck!

1690
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:17,460
Do you have any balls down there?

1691
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,460
You're the biggest kid! Get over here!

1692
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:26,460
I don't know. Who says we haven't done Mamamani for two hours? Come on.

1693
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,460
You know, I'm a person. Give me an end.

1694
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,460
That is a cool game.

1695
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,460
That is a freaking awesome game.

1696
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,460
Baby. Baby.

1697
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:37,460
Baby makes a good sequel to Blaster Master.

1698
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:42,460
That's what I, oh I'm just ignoring all those other copies of Blaster Master that they've done since.

1699
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:43,460
The first one.

1700
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,460
The first one is this. The first one is this.

1701
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,460
And you know what?

1702
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:51,460
Last time I saw, last time I saw you, I thought you were going to have some at that.

1703
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,460
Your HPT is so good.

1704
01:55:58,460 --> 01:55:59,460
Yeah!

1705
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,460
Okay, well.

1706
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,460
Ooh, I have commando and leatherback.

1707
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,460
Man, that'd be pretty cool.

1708
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:09,460
I mean, they have one in Game Boy, but, yeah.

1709
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:11,460
At least I don't know, just, you know, that'd be cool.

1710
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,460
Or, some other, you know, game system.

1711
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:15,460
Yeah, they do!

1712
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:17,160
The guy has legs!

1713
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:53,160
I thought I would also bring up before the show is over, I'm going to get to pay five more dollars a month to keep this station running

1714
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:59,160
because of the carp, royalty, well they're not carp, but the royalty rates that were passed this week by, I don't know, some judge

1715
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:07,160
and I'm horribly misinformed on what's going on, but basically, one story short of it, internet radio is now going to have to pay seven cents

1716
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:11,160
for every thousand listeners that are listening to this song.

1717
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:15,160
Now not that this station should have much of a problem because they don't have many listeners,

1718
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:21,160
But, um, unfortunately our host, Y365, decided to do a blanket fee for everybody.

1719
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,160
So everybody's going to have to pay five bucks.

1720
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:25,160
Which, you know, is a cool way to do it.

1721
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:28,160
Y365 is very good. It's even got the station going on and everything.

1722
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:30,160
I can't really knock them because they do provide a really good service.

1723
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,160
Because this thing would never be able to run on a chat chat.

1724
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:38,160
But, um, if you do think this sucks, I would visit saveinternetradio.org

1725
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:41,160
and have a read there on what's going on with internet radio.

1726
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:46,160
Because if over the air radio stations aren't having to pay these kind of fees, why are we?

1727
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,160
I guess is quite odd going on.

1728
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,160
Save Internet Radio says.

1729
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,160
So saveinternetradio.org.

1730
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:53,160
Let my PPL go.

1731
01:57:53,160 --> 01:58:12,160
Well we could pay for a week of pay for last show and this show will come by...anyway.

1732
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:18,160
While we figure that out, do listen in next week.

1733
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:23,760
Uh, Jamie's got the week off again, but we'll have, uh, I mean, or somebody will be, yeah, two or one.

1734
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,260
I'll be here.

1735
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:24,760
Ah!

1736
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,360
We're not supposed to disclose, you know, we'll have fun!

1737
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,560
We don't want to ever do a video.

1738
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,060
Is anybody else gonna be here next week?

1739
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:32,860
I'll be here.

1740
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:35,260
Bradley's going in, and I said, you know what, though?

1741
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:36,660
We, we appreciate having you here, Bradley.

1742
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:39,160
The listeners ain't even gonna notice, cause you never say anything.

1743
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:40,060
Oh my god.

1744
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,360
Like you said, it's moral support.

1745
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,060
Moral support.

1746
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:47,060
Glen will be here next week because he's going off to school, so he won't be here.

1747
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:51,060
I will be here definitely. Alright, sounds good.

1748
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:56,060
I will see you all next week then. Thank you for listening everybody. Have a good night.

1749
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:57,060
Good night!

1750
01:58:57,060 --> 01:59:00,060
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1751
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:02,700
Orange Lounge Radio is an orange lau-
