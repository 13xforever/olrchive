1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:08,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:15,557
[SPEAKER_17]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:22,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,666
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

10
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,797
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.

11
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,018
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite sex?

12
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:49,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Showgirls.

13
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely frightful.

14
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:52,737
[SPEAKER_01]: What's yours?

15
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:55,218
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:58,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job.

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

20
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:05,822
[SPEAKER_22]: I know Kung Fu.

21
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,883
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

22
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

23
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody expects a Spanish exposition!

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Kendo.

25
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:16,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Kendo!

26
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,053
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,582
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live and this is episode number 23 for December the 8th of 2002.

28
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, we're taping the show a day early on December 7th of 2002 because we've all decided to go out and get a life this Sunday night.

29
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:50,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can.

30
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can.

31
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:52,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to clean.

32
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,366
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to clean.

33
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Joy, joy.

34
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:57,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

35
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we're better as DarkSakura.

36
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that corner, it is our tech massa, Loki.

37
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:26,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody.

38
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:30,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have with us tonight in the studio, nobody else.

39
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:33,419
[SPEAKER_16]: There's nobody else here because... They're playing Animal Crossing like addicts.

40
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad and Irene are out in the front, but they're playing Animal Crossing because they suck.

41
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit hitting people with thug nets and get in here.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a show.

44
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:41,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Pitfalls.

45
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget the pitfalls.

46
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,782
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later.

47
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,796
[SPEAKER_03]: First, we're going to take a quick break.

48
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a bunch of poppin' music songs this break.

49
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Won't that be fun?

50
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other opening thoughts from you kids?

51
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:56,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I just made a treble clef with a microphone cord.

52
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:58,428
[SPEAKER_16]: That's special.

53
00:02:58,549 --> 00:02:58,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

54
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:06,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on tonight's show, the usual talk of nothing, and a new game.

55
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be doing a new game tonight.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,430
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

57
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what else.

58
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:13,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy this opening.

59
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how we're going to go three hours tonight, but we'll make it.

60
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,894
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll manage somehow.

61
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:18,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for listening.

62
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,717
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some pop-up music stuff, and we'll be right back.

63
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all from Pop-Up Music 6.

64
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So especially the pop-up music club that wrote us a letter a couple weeks back saying we need to play more pop-up music.

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,001
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make a Matthew.

66
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:30,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello, Irene.

67
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:37,780
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone wants to go Rocky, maybe even in SoCal.

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight.

69
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:41,922
[SPEAKER_16]: How can we get there tonight?

70
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:43,562
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be fun.

71
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:50,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm being talked to on the phone.

72
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think now is a very good time to go to break.

73
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,267
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

74
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:53,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

75
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:54,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, break!

76
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:03,586
Thanks for watching!

77
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,700
Thanks for watching!

78
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

79
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:31,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

80
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:37,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

81
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:40,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, boys and girls, you're...

82
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello!

83
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,966
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't want another song yet.

84
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:45,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's what I get for having the thing on repeat.

85
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:46,747
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad, my bad.

86
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:53,789
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope you enjoyed the pre-show that we did tonight of all the Beatmania 6th mix music.

87
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:55,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It was super.

88
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how you kids doing tonight?

89
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

90
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're extra special on a Saturday tonight for no real good reason.

91
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, we're not going to be here tomorrow night, so we had to do the show sometime.

92
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we tend to pre-tape the shows at another location, well, that's just too much work for me.

93
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:16,849
[SPEAKER_03]: This is much easier.

94
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have been stupid on a Saturday night like anywhere, like Golfland or Scandi.

95
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,154
[SPEAKER_05]: You have all these kids around.

96
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:24,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, it would have been nuts.

97
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:25,636
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

98
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:26,617
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

99
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:27,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you have the microphone?

100
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:28,659
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

101
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, go away.

102
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate kids.

103
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:32,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

104
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:35,165
[SPEAKER_16]: We should sacrifice them to the Dark Lord.

105
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's especially evil tonight.

106
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:51,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I went over to Golfland the other day to play some games and there really wasn't anything to play because 5Key was broken, Guitar Freaks was broken, 4th Plus was broken.

107
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:55,758
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the sound of me putting my finger down my throat in honor of RVGL.

108
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:09,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but of course, those of you out there listening that aren't from this area have no idea what we're talking about, but it just gets really frustrating when you have all these Bomani games at your local arcade and none of them work.

109
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them.

110
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,574
[SPEAKER_16]: We should send copies of the show to Steve and say, this is the bad press that we're giving you.

111
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:18,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Fix it.

112
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd probably just ignore it like everything else we've given him.

113
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go improve the laser tag.

114
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:29,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's see.

115
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:36,135
[SPEAKER_05]: First, start by making the guns not look like a giant wad of crap wrapped around with electrical tape a thousand times.

116
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,317
[SPEAKER_05]: They can improve it by making it a QZAR.

117
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:41,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right they could.

118
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd play it if it was QZAR.

119
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,402
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not, so I don't touch it, or go near it, or even think about it.

120
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:52,505
[SPEAKER_03]: QZAR is kind of like the supreme of laser tag guns.

121
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,245
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no other.

122
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:54,106
[SPEAKER_03]: There can be only one.

123
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,947
[SPEAKER_05]: There is only one, because they keep closing the fucking centers down.

124
00:11:59,348 --> 00:11:59,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

125
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,550
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like one in Concord, and that was like the closest one.

126
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's one in San Fran, I think, and then there's some down south.

127
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:05,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasanton?

128
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:06,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Pleasanton.

129
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Pleasanton, you know.

130
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:08,876
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got one.

131
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been there in a while.

132
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:13,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how was your week?

133
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do this week, Jamie?

134
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,121
[SPEAKER_16]: I worked.

135
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:17,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

136
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:18,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what?

137
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do in the night time?

138
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I sat in front of my computer.

139
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:25,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we're going to get to that with part of my fight for the week.

140
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:29,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't do crap all weekend.

141
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:29,998
[SPEAKER_16]: I hung out with people.

142
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:31,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Which you did today.

143
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,419
[SPEAKER_03]: You went and saw Harry Potter again.

144
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:33,959
[SPEAKER_16]: I went and saw Harry Potter for the fourth time.

145
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, indeed.

146
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And was it just as good as it was the first time?

147
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes.

148
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to see it again four more times.

149
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:47,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, I will go see that movie as often as I can before it's out of the theater.

150
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:56,893
[SPEAKER_03]: The only movie I ever saw more than twice in the theater, well, besides Rocky Horror, because you see that every week, Moulin Rouge, I saw three times.

151
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:58,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles four times.

152
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, indeed.

153
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:02,896
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so old.

154
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get that on DVD.

155
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:05,617
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw Bill and Ted twice.

156
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.

157
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw that twice.

158
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

159
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And I saw Wrath of Khan twice during its original run in the theater.

160
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:14,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

161
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

162
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,083
[SPEAKER_16]: At a theater that burned down.

163
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:20,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Smells like burning.

164
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:23,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And how was your week, Loki?

165
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:24,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I worked.

166
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess you could call it working.

167
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the computer downloading shit, as usual.

168
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,087
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time I was downloading places.

169
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:33,869
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell's that noise?

170
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, my computer farted, just ignore it.

171
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:38,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

172
00:13:54,887 --> 00:14:01,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was downloading PlayStation Utilities to attempt to hack a DDR Max 2 disc.

173
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:11,038
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a short-lived attempt, seeing as I... This is the one you yacked about a couple weeks ago, about how you're going to have the ultimate DDR mix, but no... Too tough.

174
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't too tough as I know jack about programming.

175
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of you need to know how to hack something to be able to hack a DDR Max 2 machine.

176
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:22,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But since I don't know how to do that, that's obviously not going to work.

177
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,724
[SPEAKER_05]: All I have to say is there's some weird shit in there.

178
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the way they do things on the Max 2 disks doesn't make any sense.

179
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:36,735
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know why they do it because they have like for instance the banners for the songs and everything.

180
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,357
[SPEAKER_05]: They have them stored in there three times.

181
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:46,785
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the executable for Max 2 stored in there about 19 times and then they have like a copy of the actual card that it flashes once.

182
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, why store all this excess data?

183
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find the backgrounds.

184
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even going to look anymore because I'm just fed up with it.

185
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:54,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired.

186
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:56,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Not worth it.

187
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,114
[SPEAKER_05]: The videos, I know where the videos are.

188
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where the music is.

189
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:04,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't decode it worth shit, so I said forget it.

190
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't care.

191
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,821
[SPEAKER_03]: No illegal mixes from Loki.

192
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:08,721
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing.

193
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:12,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's going to ever come down to it, I'll just buy a machine and run my sim on it.

194
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:16,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a hundred times easier to maintain and work.

195
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:20,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to have to buy the giant metal pads and just do it that way.

196
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:29,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Because really, actually, I was looking at it, there is a limit to how many songs you can put on there because it actually stores a lot of the data on the flash card itself, and the flash card is only 32 megs.

197
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:37,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you could probably cram more stuff on there, but it looked pretty full as it was.

198
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:51,655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm thinking after Xtreme comes out, they're going to do something else the way they store stuff on there, because there's no way that they're going to be able to fit anything else on Xtreme, because it's all stuck on that stupid flashcard.

199
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty dumb, because all the graphics are on that stupid flashcard.

200
00:15:56,357 --> 00:16:03,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now, and EOSFBB agrees that you should just put a computer with a SIM inside a DDR cabinet.

201
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:12,648
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do want to join our chat room, by the way, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx, and then click on chat, and it tells you how to do it right there.

202
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, since we're taping a day early this week, if you go in there on Sunday night, well, there's still quite a few people in there listening to this for the first time on Sunday night, because people are just used to that.

203
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, tell me about your week.

204
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:24,452
[SPEAKER_03]: You're over there in the corner.

205
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

206
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:25,913
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

207
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, my brother?

208
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,334
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a job now.

209
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,034
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a job now.

210
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:29,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

211
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:30,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

212
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Isn't that fun?

213
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,176
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody enjoys that.

214
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,457
[SPEAKER_23]: No, but I get money now, so that's always good.

215
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:36,258
[SPEAKER_23]: Money's good.

216
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:37,238
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you spend all your money on?

217
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Rent, bills.

218
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you digging through the couch for tokens the other day.

219
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty sad.

220
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

221
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,266
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I gamble for tokens.

222
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:53,292
[SPEAKER_23]: We play poker for tokens.

223
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:56,749
[SPEAKER_23]: What else did you do this week?

224
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do anything fun?

225
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,630
[SPEAKER_03]: See any good movies?

226
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out and do anything fun?

227
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:01,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play any DDR?

228
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,512
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I played Guitar Freaks.

229
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,213
[SPEAKER_23]: Guitar Freaks is broken now, I hear.

230
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,255
[SPEAKER_23]: No, but I just saw Harry Potter, too.

231
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:10,935
[SPEAKER_23]: That was pretty good.

232
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:11,756
[SPEAKER_23]: Harry Potter!

233
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:13,437
[SPEAKER_23]: I played Metroid Prime yesterday.

234
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:13,917
[SPEAKER_23]: That was good.

235
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:16,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Nothing really.

236
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,138
[SPEAKER_23]: See, I have no life.

237
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:18,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I just work.

238
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to buy Metroid Prime today, but I'm holding off.

239
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You should buy it.

240
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a gift card at Target that'll give me money off, so I figured I'll just use my gift card.

241
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:29,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the next best GameCube game you should get.

242
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:31,930
[SPEAKER_23]: I want games.

243
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,391
[SPEAKER_23]: I give you games.

244
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I have some money, I can go buy games.

245
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie's reaching for my mic.

246
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:40,435
[SPEAKER_16]: I can lend you games.

247
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:41,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Ooh!

248
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:42,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely.

249
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:42,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

250
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,077
[SPEAKER_16]: You can borrow Luigi's Banshan.

251
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:45,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

252
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that game sucks.

253
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:47,960
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually kind of neat.

254
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,522
[SPEAKER_16]: If you like puzzling, you know, little puzzles to solve.

255
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they put out a version of DDR on the GameCube, actually.

256
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of have this secret desire for DDR on the GameCube.

257
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:56,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

258
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it would be, like, overly cutesy and fun.

259
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oha, but cool.

260
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Oha's cool, but Oha only has like seven songs on it.

261
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:10,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So they need to do like a 70 song DDR Oha for GameCube.

262
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:12,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You and that damn parrot!

263
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:18,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I can lend you monkey ball.

264
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:20,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You can lend me monkey balls?

265
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:21,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

266
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,719
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay, I was in here eating nuts.

267
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,461
[SPEAKER_23]: This conversation has turned dreadfully perverted.

268
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,524
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no idea what we're going to be talking about tonight.

269
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,885
[SPEAKER_23]: So wait, I came in late.

270
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,346
[SPEAKER_23]: I know this is going to be boring for everybody else.

271
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:33,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

272
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:37,168
[SPEAKER_23]: Did Matt get a, he got the flashcard finally, or what?

273
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:38,889
[SPEAKER_23]: You were looking at the flashcard?

274
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,510
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically given up on the sim.

275
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,973
[SPEAKER_03]: He got, he obtained super secret copies of the Max 2 discs.

276
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:44,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

277
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:49,056
[SPEAKER_03]: and was able to look at them and then thought, God, this really sucks.

278
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:50,818
[SPEAKER_03]: This is hard to hack, so fuck it.

279
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:57,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we should enlist a certain person whose name starts with R-I and ends with a C-K.

280
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,685
[SPEAKER_23]: He's good with programming and coding, and you can look at it.

281
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,307
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'm serious.

282
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,157
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you think, Matt?

283
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:06,598
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you give it a try?

284
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:07,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care whatever.

285
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:09,839
[SPEAKER_05]: He just gave up.

286
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't give a crap anymore.

287
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I did get something good out of it that I already kind of had.

288
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I got high-res banners for everything that's in Max 2.

289
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Max 2 and all the old songs.

290
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have super high-res banners now for that, which is kind of cool.

291
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:30,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I did find out a little bit how Max 2 works, but I really just don't care.

292
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the person that gave me the disc said he had some friends in places that know how to do this kind of cracking stuff and said he was going to give it to them and let them, you know, go at it.

293
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,698
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, I haven't heard of anything.

294
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to ask him and see if he's going to do that.

295
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if he did that and they figured it out, then yeah, I could go ahead and do it.

296
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,664
[SPEAKER_05]: But, right now... Stop it.

297
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

298
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:58,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop that.

299
00:19:59,308 --> 00:19:59,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Just now.

300
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:09,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, aside from trying to get that thing to work, I was watching Taken all week long.

301
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking into a squirrel's penis.

302
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not in studio right now, which is everybody.

303
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: The bush baby has a big black... Jamie's playing with a microphone to make it look like the ferret has a penis, and it's really wrong, and it's just kind of sitting there limp.

304
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie's screaming, oh my god, it has a big black penis.

305
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:36,424
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are weird.

306
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,926
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an interesting episode of Orange Lounge already, I can tell.

307
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just as much of a train wreck as our other pre-taped shows, what can you say?

308
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't have the magic when it's not Sunday.

309
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,885
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my fault they didn't do anything to the Monty community.

310
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:53,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's freaking lazy and shopping instead.

311
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:54,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, out shopping.

312
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:55,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All their fault.

313
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, is going to tie into our listless topic tonight.

314
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:04,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, yeah, stuff did happen, it's just, you know, minor stuff.

315
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:06,333
[SPEAKER_16]: What, stupid stuff?

316
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:07,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, stupid stuff.

317
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Some stupid news that doesn't apply to anyone here in the United States.

318
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:21,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Euromix2, they finally figured out the speed modifier code because the retards at Konami of Europe or whatever decided, hey, you know what?

319
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting in a menu where you can select options is so not European.

320
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:32,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just have it where you just do the nice little arrow combinations on the pad and that way you can get codes that way.

321
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:35,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't really tell them what the codes were, you know, for speed modifiers.

322
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,829
[SPEAKER_05]: They knew they were there, they just couldn't access them.

323
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:44,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally someone figured out what it is, and now they have, like, you know, 1.5 speed and 2 speed like we have over here, which is retarded.

324
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid Europeans, you know, what can I say?

325
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey now, be nice.

326
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: A rogue was just going to tell you the same thing, they figured out the Euromix speed codes today.

327
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So, almost beat you to it if there wasn't that delay.

328
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:02,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, Jamie has a hole in her crotch.

329
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,824
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think it happened when I got snagged when I was getting out of the car.

330
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,065
[SPEAKER_16]: My car.

331
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of it this way, easy access.

332
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it's on the front by the zipper, okay?

333
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Not anywhere near low enough.

334
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:22,016
[SPEAKER_16]: This means that I gotta go buy new jeans.

335
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:23,598
[SPEAKER_16]: People give me money.

336
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:26,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a penny.

337
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,197
[SPEAKER_23]: So do I. That's it.

338
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:30,919
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I taking up a collection for?

339
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:35,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at a party, a small little party last night, and I remember I was taking up a collection for something, and I got a penny.

340
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,205
[SPEAKER_18]: We need the dead baby fund.

341
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:37,485
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

342
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:38,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Dead baby fund?

343
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:38,806
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

344
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:39,347
[SPEAKER_18]: You're gross.

345
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Kobe, it is... Never mind.

346
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You're... Oh my god, you are awful.

347
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:48,936
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an inside joke we're going to tell off there.

348
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:51,839
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm sorry.

349
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:55,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in a semi-foul mood.

350
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is perfect for radio.

351
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:57,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this?

352
00:22:58,325 --> 00:22:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you in a foul mood?

353
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:00,927
[SPEAKER_16]: None of anyone's business.

354
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:01,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm allowed.

355
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:01,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a chick.

356
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you PMSing?

357
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:03,349
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

358
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you pregnant?

359
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:06,732
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

360
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank God.

361
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:10,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the ferret thrown at me.

362
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:12,798
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

363
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:19,086
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I can understand.

364
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,868
[SPEAKER_23]: She's got a hole in her jeans, pretty soon to be bigger, you know, you never know.

365
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you building an interocitor in there?

366
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:28,051
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

367
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,894
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know that reference.

368
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:36,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't see it.

369
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:38,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you boys playing nice in there?

370
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:39,339
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

371
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you building an interocitor?

372
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:40,840
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

373
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:45,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

374
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the mailbag.

375
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:49,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I do that?

376
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open up the mailbag.

377
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:51,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, kitty.

378
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:53,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, kitty.

379
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play some moha next break because the chatroom demands it.

380
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,390
Hi.

381
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,512
[SPEAKER_16]: And now the ferret will entertain.

382
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

383
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to our mailbag.

384
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop looking at DDR Freak.

385
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go to that noob site.

386
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

387
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:15,276
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple FUs in here.

388
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do those later.

389
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:16,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's one.

390
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I do have an email to read.

391
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,278
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you know?

392
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get the email reading music, shall we?

393
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:24,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunting for music.

394
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:24,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunting for music.

395
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I will read a page out of Harry Potter.

396
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:29,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunting for music.

397
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I will read a page out of this book.

398
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you going to read a page out of Harry Potter?

399
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:42,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

400
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

401
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Because seeing as how I sat here during the pre-show and read the whole book.

402
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go, here we go.

403
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:52,275
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an email.

404
00:24:54,837 --> 00:25:00,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's from the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP Network.

405
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:02,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.

406
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And it reads as follows.

407
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:07,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki should have his own show where he sets fire to the French.

408
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn those French.

409
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:12,489
[SPEAKER_03]: They annoy me so with their Frenchness.

410
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Your show rocks.

411
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:19,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We here at the OMG PMT HPS OGTHP Network are very pleased.

412
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:27,744
[SPEAKER_03]: We will continue to show support to your show and we'll sacrifice one virgin every week so that we may hear you play Instant Love again.

413
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:29,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Instant Love, you must.

414
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,847
[SPEAKER_03]: We demand it or Kung Fu Squirrels will rain upon you.

415
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:32,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

416
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:38,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The preceded message was brought to you by the Oh My God, Please Make the Horrible Pain Stop, Oh God, the Horrible Pain Network.

417
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:40,652
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should give in to their demands.

418
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,252
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

419
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:42,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we just played Instant Love last week.

420
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:43,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We know what we should do.

421
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

422
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play it again.

423
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we should do?

424
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we put Instant Love in the normal rotation?

425
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:48,637
[SPEAKER_03]: The music rotation for when we're not here.

426
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:49,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Instant Love is special.

427
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that our music show's not special?

428
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: No wonder no one listens to it, because you told them that it's not special.

429
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:57,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Special enough for the Olympics.

430
00:25:57,943 --> 00:25:58,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

431
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Our show is special, but Instant Love is special.

432
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, we'll play Instant Love.

433
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:03,785
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

434
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:04,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn.

435
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are such bitches.

436
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all the email we got.

437
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:13,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's all I'm reading for you.

438
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:16,250
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, of course, one more email than we got last week.

439
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So, actually, no, it's not.

440
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:18,351
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get an email.

441
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to send us an email, go ahead and send us an email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

442
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,336
[SPEAKER_16]: And sign up for our LiveJournal community.

443
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sign up for the LiveJournal community.

444
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:31,039
[SPEAKER_16]: And, like, sacrifice your balls to...

445
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:34,486
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to be nosy and read all your journals.

446
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,187
[SPEAKER_23]: Were you just strangling the squirrel-ferret thing with the mic cord?

447
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,448
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the squirrel was doing it itself.

448
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:43,149
[SPEAKER_16]: It was auto-erotic asphyxiation.

449
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:45,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my!

450
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Excuse me!

451
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm still breathing!

452
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,111
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay!

453
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:50,491
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just a nice term.

454
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,732
[SPEAKER_16]: It just rolls off the tongue to say.

455
00:26:56,296 --> 00:27:03,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a really quick break at this point and we're going to come back and we're going to play a brand new game.

456
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are weird.

457
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:09,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to play a brand new game.

458
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:11,846
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I need two contestants for this game.

459
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take contestants from the chat room.

460
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to all be the celebrities.

461
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:16,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you get to be a celebrity tonight.

462
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,691
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to be a contestant, you're a celebrity.

463
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:20,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, does that mean I get here?

464
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, this is the question.

465
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:30,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the first two people to private message me with the right answer to this question will get to play our new game, our new secret game.

466
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was, this is going to be easy, it's easy.

467
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the artist that did the song Young Forever?

468
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the artist that did that song in 4th Mix?

469
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:45,599
[SPEAKER_03]: First two people to PM me the answer, get to play.

470
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's it, and we will be right back.

471
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Who PM'd me the correct answer?

472
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:51,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

473
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to PM me the correct answer.

474
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:54,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game show.

475
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Just not an answer.

476
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,448
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first two people that... Like, you can't, you know, PM... Oh, it was Bob!

477
00:27:59,308 --> 00:27:59,969
[SPEAKER_16]: And expect to play.

478
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:02,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have to PM me the correct answer.

479
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the artist that did Young Forever?

480
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:09,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people forget some of the Dance Mania artists sometimes, so I figured that's a good one to ask you guys.

481
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to take a quick break.

482
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:13,077
[SPEAKER_03]: As requested by the chat room, the chat room demands it.

483
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:15,499
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hear some oha.

[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first one.

533
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.

534
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:18,554
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really blank.

535
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.

536
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:31,787
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really blank.

537
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's thinking.

538
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need answers from both contestants.

539
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Yo, answer now.

540
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I poke your eye out with a spoon.

541
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:04,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

542
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give him a little more thinking time.

543
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,171
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm still missing one.

544
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:11,992
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably trying to come up with something clever.

545
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:16,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, he's clocked in.

546
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:20,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

547
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,594
[SPEAKER_03]: He had quite a little bit of an answer there.

548
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:22,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

549
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see what the answers were.

550
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Our contestant said, EOSVB says, Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.

551
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:44,940
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really thin, almost to the point where they looked like they were strung out on heroin, but it was from all the cardio.

552
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

553
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:48,301
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

554
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,802
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus' answer is...

555
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:56,019
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really popular.

556
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Popular.

557
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we have popular and looked like they were strung out on heroin.

558
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, what was your answer?

559
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:05,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Super cool, pimpin' smooth like butter.

560
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Super cool, pimpin' smooth like butter.

561
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:09,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

562
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:10,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't match.

563
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:11,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

564
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:13,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess, what was your answer?

565
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:15,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Asian.

566
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,226
[SPEAKER_03]: was really Asian.

567
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:20,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, that doesn't match.

568
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:23,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your answer.

569
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone that played the game was really super.

570
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:27,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Really super.

571
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, doesn't answer.

572
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't match.

573
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, your answer.

574
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:34,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else who played the game was really gay?

575
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:35,572
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

576
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:36,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not my answer.

577
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Greasy.

578
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Was really greasy.

579
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that doesn't match either.

580
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:43,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd bathe that.

581
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:48,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and my answer was, he had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really gay.

582
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I did put gay, actually.

583
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,721
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that means it's all tied up at 0-0.

584
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,002
[SPEAKER_03]: You all loser!

585
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,323
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both losers so far, but that's okay.

586
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Super loser number one!

587
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:03,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got four more questions to go.

588
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:04,586

593
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:15,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

595
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:19,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so here we go.

596
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:20,644

00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:43,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Freddy the Freestyler was the leadest freestyler in all of Florida.

601

603
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:10,255

[SPEAKER_03]: She's also hairy.

758
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:42,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, lovable Lucy loves Parapara more than any other game in the land.

759
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: She's short, Asian, cute, has big boobs, and she's also really, really a guy.

760
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:54,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Which would have matched a couple other people in the chat room, but unfortunately neither of our contestants guessed that she was a guy.

761
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it would have almost been a match.

762
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:03,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

763
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:06,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

764
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last question, guys.

765
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still... Let's total the scores here.

766
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:17,861
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSVB has zero, and 23rd Magus also has zero.

767
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:18,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You lose.

768
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:19,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day, sir.

769
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:25,066
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are unable to get a match on this last one, we're just going to have to post on the website that they both lost.

770
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:27,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're both losers.

771
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suggest you get this one right.

772
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:31,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

773
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:32,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting mean now.

774
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:34,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to the first music.

775
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's better.

776
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:36,776
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a better key.

777
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

778
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:38,537
[SPEAKER_03]: You like this key better?

779
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's the last question.

780
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:44,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully... Gee, Brad!

781
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: ...was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade.

782
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:54,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank.

783
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:03,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank.

784
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:07,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's thinking.

785
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:19,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one contestant in.

786
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:26,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting some funny answers from the chat room already.

787
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for one from EOSFVB.

788
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank.

789
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:48,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

790
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

791
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start with the OSFBB.

792
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:53,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Are all the celebrities in?

793
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:53,848
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

794
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we still got one thinking.

795
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:55,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

796
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFBB specifically stated that he's pulling to get your answer on this one.

797
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:05,496
[SPEAKER_03]: He's trying to match you on this one.

798
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,318
[SPEAKER_03]: He's trying to think... Oh, did you get it?

799
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:08,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You in?

800
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:09,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everybody in?

801
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you in?

802
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

803
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:22,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player of the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a... EOSFBB says he'd call you a propel.

804
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:25,488
[SPEAKER_07]: What?! !

805
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:29,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he said he was trying to match you.

806
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:31,555
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

807
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:37,557
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus says, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a fag.

808
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:40,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Heaven forbid.

809
00:52:41,678 --> 00:52:42,359
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jamie.

810
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if VO said VB got that match he was hoping for.

811
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:51,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully was the best beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a... Propel, wow.

812
00:52:51,962 --> 00:52:52,422
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

813
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:54,962
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd call you a blank.

814
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:56,563
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd call you a blank.

815
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I decided not to answer.

816
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:00,471
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd call you a blank.

817
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:01,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

818
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:03,133
[SPEAKER_03]: The audience is booing Jamie.

819
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:03,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

820
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:04,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have a smiley face.

821
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

822
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:07,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Next!

823
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:08,436
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, next.

824
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,799
[SPEAKER_16]: He would call him a cab so he'd have a chance to get away before he beats his ass.

825
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:16,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, call him a cab.

826
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that doesn't match.

827
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:19,821
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

828
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:21,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some funny answers from the chat room.

829
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabberwocky says he'd call you later that night for a date.

830
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:28,433
[SPEAKER_03]: or he'd call you a Michael Jackson wannabe with a nose and no baby.

831
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:37,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'd call you a cheese, windmill, Carl Sagan pocket watch, ass blaster.

832
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,340
[SPEAKER_00]: What an ass bandit.

833
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,940
[SPEAKER_03]: A pansy ass stupid fuck.

834
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

835
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's moving on.

836
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:46,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

837
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:47,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to match our contestants.

838
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:51,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a propel and we have a fag.

839
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:51,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I did?

840
00:53:51,704 --> 00:53:52,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's moving on.

841
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:53,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's moving on.

842
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:56,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's moving on!

843
00:53:57,922 --> 00:53:58,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

844
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:06,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if you distracted him to talk about DDR, Loki, he'd call you a... Well, you know, I had two, but this was my first answer, was Fag.

845
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

846
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:12,227
[SPEAKER_05]: My second answer was Fiery Monkey Pirate, but... Which one are you going to go with?

847
00:54:12,428 --> 00:54:13,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going with Fag.

848
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:13,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going with Fag?

849
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:14,608
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my first one.

850
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, we have a match!

851
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!

852
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

853
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, 23rd Magus is ahead by one.

854
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: He did get a match.

855
00:54:23,512 --> 00:54:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

856
00:54:24,705 --> 00:54:27,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had to have said Propel for EOSVB to win.

857
00:54:28,928 --> 00:54:29,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Lead me.

858
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:30,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

859
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:30,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Lead me out.

860
00:54:30,889 --> 00:54:33,491
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd call you a... Propel.

861
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:34,051
[SPEAKER_23]: No, just kidding.

862
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:38,934
[SPEAKER_23]: I, Bradley, would call him a cock-smoking clerk.

863
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,695
[SPEAKER_23]: A cock-smoking clerk.

864
00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:41,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

865
00:54:42,256 --> 00:54:43,177
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't a match.

866
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And Brad gets the Kevin Smith Award.

867
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,541
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSVB wants to change his answer to Animal Crossing.

868
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:50,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Too late.

869
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:51,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I was about to say that, too.

870
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:52,983
[SPEAKER_16]: I was about to say that.

871
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:54,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my answer.

872
00:54:55,473 --> 00:55:03,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a sacramental.

873
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:09,397
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's more the chibi mental.

874
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this game was a blank.

875
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:18,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

876
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so our winner was 23rd Magus with a score of 0-1.

877
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

878
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

879
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:27,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

880
00:55:28,218 --> 00:55:29,059
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that means?

881
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,521
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets to play the bonus round.

882
00:55:34,043 --> 00:55:34,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

883
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:37,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so 23rd Magus gets to play the bonus round.

884
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be taking only 23rd Magus' question on this question.

885
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:41,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

886
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:47,733
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.

887
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,261
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.

888
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:57,722
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus gets to play the bonus round on this one.

889
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:04,664
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.

890
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:12,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody have an answer?

891
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:15,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, everybody's got an answer?

892
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for our contestant.

893
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

894
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:23,009
[SPEAKER_03]: The bonus round.

895
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:27,732
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment on Orange Lounge, according to 23rd Magus, was really, really random.

896
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:29,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.

897
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:30,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Good logical answer.

898
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You will probably lose.

899
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

900
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Random.

901
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:37,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Random!

902
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,060
[SPEAKER_16]: A match!

903
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

904
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:40,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

905
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

906
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Logic prevails.

907
00:56:41,922 --> 00:56:43,503
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus gets a point.

908
00:56:43,523 --> 00:56:44,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That's $100 of Monopoly money.

909
00:56:49,435 --> 00:56:50,575
[SPEAKER_16]: That you're not going to get.

910
00:56:50,595 --> 00:56:51,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That you're not going to get.

911
00:56:51,937 --> 00:56:56,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Ooh, Animal Crossing.

912
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Animal Crossing.

913
00:56:58,702 --> 00:57:03,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... A complete waste of my time.

914
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,067
[SPEAKER_05]: A complete waste... It did take up a good half an hour.

915
00:57:06,328 --> 00:57:08,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really, really fiery-ass Monkey Pirate.

916
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fiery-ass Monkey Pirate.

917
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:10,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

918
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:19,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Cunt shit, colic balls, ass dick, fucker... Colic balls?

919
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:23,504
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really colic balls.

920
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:26,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I have colitis.

921
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And my answer was, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really propel.

922
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:34,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people in the chatroom got it.

923
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

924
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:39,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So 23rd Magus won $100 of Monopoly money.

925
00:57:40,615 --> 00:57:41,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll buy him some Propel.

926
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations.

927
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:43,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's going to get some Propel.

928
00:57:43,996 --> 00:57:45,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll beat him with the variant.

929
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:45,637
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

930
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:48,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

931
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, you guys.

932
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:55,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come back to talk about some more Beemani stuff.

933
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,181
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, you demanded it.

934
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room demanded it.

935
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The studio demanded it by request.

936
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:03,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Colic Balls?

937
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:04,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Colic Balls.

938
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

939
00:58:12,537 --> 00:58:17,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

940
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

941
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:24,929
[SPEAKER_06]: The objects will come down from the top when it hits the red line.

942
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:31,684
[SPEAKER_07]: and The Table!

943
00:58:32,246 --> 00:58:33,029
[SPEAKER_06]: You get it?

944
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:35,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's practice!

945
00:59:02,093 --> 00:59:04,438
[SPEAKER_06]: are both white and blackies.

946
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:32,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

947
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:33,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard, but you can do it!

948
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, please introduce this next song, because it's kind of weird.

949
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:08,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, before I came over today, I found one of the strangest Paranoia remixes ever.

950
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:15,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first, probably only, all-Spanish, Latin Paranoia remix.

951
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:19,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Paranoia Acueca, or whatever that means, I don't know.

952
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:20,115
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

953
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a DWI for it, too.

954
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:22,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

955
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:23,935
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

956
01:02:05,836 --> 01:02:07,838
Take it baby Bring it on down

957
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:41,585
Thanks for watching!

958
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:05,812
Thanks for watching!

959
01:06:55,598 --> 01:07:01,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

960
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio semi-live for December the 8th.

961
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:14,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually taping on December the 7th.

962
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:18,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of you are already tuned in right now here on Saturday night.

963
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will be rebroadcast in its entirety on Sunday night at the normal time.

964
01:07:22,225 --> 01:07:23,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so people don't get too confused.

965
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:24,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

966
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:28,968
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in the chat room wondering why you can't really participate live with the show tonight, that's why.

967
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:30,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we tape today early.

968
01:07:30,709 --> 01:07:31,309
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on Saturday.

969
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

970
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back and don't have a lot to talk about, so this is the point where we usually would let Loki do a sim update.

971
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:39,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So!

972
01:07:40,754 --> 01:07:42,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on in the sim world this week?

973
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:44,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

974
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:47,958
[SPEAKER_05]: They're wrapping up with the submissions for Attorney Mix 3.

975
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:49,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are due next Sunday.

976
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,640
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be, I believe, the 15th.

977
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure they have your stuff in by, I would say, by 9 p.m.

978
01:07:57,502 --> 01:07:58,163
[SPEAKER_05]: at the latest.

979
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:00,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely way before that, though.

980
01:08:00,384 --> 01:08:03,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But try to get your stuff in for Attorney Mix 3.

981
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:06,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I believe, a week after that,

982
01:08:06,827 --> 01:08:09,888
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be having actual submissions up on the web.

983
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:11,929
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be up for about one whole week.

984
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:14,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to get them then while you still can.

985
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from that, there's a few other things to know.

986
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:27,253
[SPEAKER_05]: In DDR Mania X, they've got in their user submitted files for them, they have a nice little list of every single site that has DWIs on it.

987
01:08:27,533 --> 01:08:33,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where actually that Paranoia Remix came from because there is a DWI out there for that Paranoia Remix.

988
01:08:34,895 --> 01:08:38,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out, and you can always increase your collection that way.

989
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And just do watch that forum, they have some pretty good files that have come out recently.

990
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got one for Baby Got Back, you gotta love that song.

991
01:08:46,563 --> 01:08:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely keep an eye on that.

992
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:52,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, nothing really new with Stepmania.

993
01:08:53,527 --> 01:09:01,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I have checked their site, and it looks like they are in preparations for starting betas for version 4, but...

994
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:04,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing really announced yet.

995
01:09:04,883 --> 01:09:07,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And DWI, I don't really care about them.

996
01:09:07,624 --> 01:09:10,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are actually updating now and trying to play catch-up.

997
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:12,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got to give them credit for that.

998
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:14,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But aside from that, not too much going on.

999
01:09:14,787 --> 01:09:15,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.

1000
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:22,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this week happened to be a week that we saw brand new DDRPC characters.

1001
01:09:23,051 --> 01:09:23,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo-hoo!

1002
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:26,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie and some chick.

1003
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:27,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what her name was.

1004
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Sabrina.

1005
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:28,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Sabrina, whatever.

1006
01:09:30,174 --> 01:09:30,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1007
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know what these are.

1008
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Reggie looks like he's got this giant dunce hat on.

1009
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: He's holding a dog with a bow.

1010
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:42,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's Sabrina who's in a bunny costume.

1011
01:09:43,035 --> 01:09:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they figure out, aren't they on their way to hacking the PC characters?

1012
01:09:46,456 --> 01:09:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about?

1013
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:56,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You were referencing something like on one of the boards that they found a way somehow to hack the PC characters or you can load them in a program or something?

1014
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:57,640
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're full of shit.

1015
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did look at that.

1016
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:07,644
[SPEAKER_05]: All that you get from looking at the one file they were talking about, the bin file I believe, is you just get a nice little shot of their face.

1017
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:08,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1018
01:10:09,244 --> 01:10:10,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Sabrina the Teenage Bitch.

1019
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:15,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so you've got this dog fucker and you've got some vampire bunny.

1020
01:10:16,113 --> 01:10:19,255
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what your characters are this week, dog fucker and vampire bunny.

1021
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:21,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing compares to Mr. Spanky.

1022
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:23,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should have Mr. Spanky back on the show.

1023
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:25,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1024
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll have Mr. Spanky back on the show a little later.

1025
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:44,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if you're still playing DDRPC, and to be honest I don't know why you would, do check those out because really I think DDRPC lost its, I don't know, interest a couple days after it came out.

1026
01:10:45,677 --> 01:10:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've played all these songs before.

1027
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like, oh, wait, this was fourth mix.

1028
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait until we can hack this and put new songs in.

1029
01:10:53,412 --> 01:11:00,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things that should be noted is there was, I guess you could call them preview versions of Bag and Paranoia Survivor on the net.

1030
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:07,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I should say really ass copies of Bag and Paranoia Survivor that were on Bimani style.

1031
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,559
[SPEAKER_05]: They were, hey, guess what, Loki?

1032
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:10,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got them right here.

1033
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:12,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to hear a little bit of Bag?

1034
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's hear it.

1035
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here's a little bit of Bag, if you guys haven't heard it yet.

1036
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:16,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's really, really quiet, so bear with us.

1037
01:11:16,942 --> 01:11:17,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1038
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:30,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of hear the bagpipe.

1039
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Riverdance!

1040
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:07,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, woohoo.

1041
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:08,932
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

1042
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:10,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's crap.

1043
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:16,417
[SPEAKER_05]: What it sounds like, it sounds like it's going to be like Orion 78, except it's going to be with bagpipes.

1044
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much half the speed, you know, down to 65 for, you know, the steps to be really close together.

1045
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be Orion.

1046
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:24,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.

1047
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:30,545
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually the kind of music I listen to when I'm trying to relax and calm down, so I like it.

1048
01:12:32,446 --> 01:12:35,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I have all kinds of CDs like that at home, so it's right up my alley.

1049
01:12:38,343 --> 01:12:41,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, want to hear Paranoia Survivor?

1050
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:43,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think you can really hear this one, but I'll play a little bit of it.

1051
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole thing, but you can barely hear it.

1052
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:46,554
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot better in the video.

1053
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:50,138
[SPEAKER_05]: If you watch the videos, definitely listen to it there.

1054
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:51,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You can barely hear it.

1055
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even really worth playing to you guys.

1056
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:01,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even really hear it.

1057
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:08,010
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I would get the videos, but I can't play videos over the air because we get a lot of droppage.

1058
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that was a little bit.

1059
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:15,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I mean, from what I've gathered from the videos, it was a pretty cool sounding song.

1060
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:23,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, you can't really listen to it on the videos because they don't have, you know, anyone that can rip it yet.

1061
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:27,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, the Konami stuff's like, no, don't do that.

1062
01:13:27,307 --> 01:13:28,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1063
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:31,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, not too much to see there either.

1064
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:36,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really been kind of a slow week in the whole Bomani community.

1065
01:13:36,474 --> 01:13:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just nothing going on.

1066
01:13:38,015 --> 01:13:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just kind of that time of year.

1067
01:13:39,236 --> 01:13:43,298
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really not anything to really do between Thanksgiving and Christmas except shop.

1068
01:13:43,398 --> 01:13:48,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's probably not going to be... I mean, DDR Max USA came out for the holiday season.

1069
01:13:48,282 --> 01:13:49,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really the last thing.

1070
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:51,364
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably not going to see anything until the beginning of the new year.

1071
01:13:51,404 --> 01:13:55,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, you know, you got Beatmania 7th Mix that's coming out for PlayStation on Christmas Eve.

1072
01:13:56,067 --> 01:14:24,400
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's about the only Bomani release coming up and then in the new year we're going to see Max 2 for Japanese Playstation 2 and what the hell 2DX7 style, yes probably next year and probably also Max 2 USA at some point but I don't know I don't even know what I haven't heard anything as far as how well Max USA actually sold I think we probably won't get any numbers until actually after the holidays we can look into that

1073
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know too much about that, unfortunately

1074
01:14:48,191 --> 01:15:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did notice that they have, you know, like DDR, they have the $2,000 metal pads, which are kind of a rip-off, but they also have, you know, as people are aware of, the 2DX arcade controllers, and they also have a pop music arcade controller, too.

1075
01:15:03,336 --> 01:15:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1076
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:05,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Question from chat room.

1077
01:15:05,356 --> 01:15:07,457
[SPEAKER_03]: When is DDR Extreme going to be released?

1078
01:15:07,557 --> 01:15:09,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Brad brings back toys for us.

1079
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:09,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1080
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:13,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel and food and drinks.

1081
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1082
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:17,700
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our...

1083
01:15:18,482 --> 01:15:19,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1084
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:20,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1085
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:20,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

1086
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:21,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1087
01:15:21,644 --> 01:15:22,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I said root beer.

1088
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:23,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1089
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1090
01:15:24,827 --> 01:15:25,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I got root beer.

1091
01:15:25,627 --> 01:15:25,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1092
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:26,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1093
01:15:26,728 --> 01:15:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1094
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:28,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you want to answer that?

1095
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:29,130
[SPEAKER_03]: When's Extreme going to be released?

1096
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:29,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Early next year.

1097
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, they're saying January.

1098
01:15:34,153 --> 01:15:36,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably the first three months of next year.

1099
01:15:37,295 --> 01:15:38,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So, first quarter next year.

1100
01:15:39,897 --> 01:15:58,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumor is it's going to debut at some tournament, but I don't possibly see how that could be the case because it's a Japanese game, so if it's going to debut anywhere, it's going to debut somewhere in Japan, and places in America will just get it whenever their distributors get it, so I don't think there's any particular way that you can debut a game.

1101
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:04,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that particular arcade might debut their game at the tournament, but you really can't control the rest of the U.S.

1102
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:05,303
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.

1103
01:16:07,984 --> 01:16:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it.

1104
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1105
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:11,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's hopefully answers about Extreme.

1106
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:18,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also right now the betas are only up to like 55 or 60% done.

1107
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably because they don't have many of the Dance Media tracks in them.

1108
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:22,096
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some, but not many.

1109
01:16:22,276 --> 01:16:28,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I mean, we've still got plenty of songs that they have to add and test first before that even happens.

1110
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:31,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's still a ways away.

1111
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:35,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1112
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom's been talking a lot about this, and I thought maybe we would too.

1113
01:16:39,987 --> 01:16:40,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Upcoming tournaments.

1114
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few tournaments coming up.

1115
01:16:43,054 --> 01:16:44,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I'd mention a few of them.

1116
01:16:45,444 --> 01:16:52,611
[SPEAKER_03]: This Friday, if I'm not mistaken, yes, this Friday, is the Miguel Milpitas Golf Land Evil Tournament Part 2, the Aftermath.

1117
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:55,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the arcade that just got Derby's Owners Club this week.

1118
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:59,198
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a tournament, and that should be a lot of fun.

1119
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a Friday night, so it's kind of like a big giant Friday night party.

1120
01:17:03,883 --> 01:17:07,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing the typical Perfect Attack and...

1121
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:10,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Freestyle competitions.

1122
01:17:10,969 --> 01:17:12,990
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they're trying some new things with both of them.

1123
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:17,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some new things that they're doing.

1124
01:17:17,293 --> 01:17:20,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to visit their website, it's www.monkeysfly.net.

1125
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:24,578
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can at all make it, please go to that one.

1126
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:34,216
[SPEAKER_03]: and Perfect Attack Rules, let's see, they're going to announce the qualifying song that day and they're going to be doing the brackets a little bit of a different way.

1127
01:17:34,697 --> 01:17:37,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Freestyle is going to be doing this tower system.

1128
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:40,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a brand new way of judging freestyle, so that should be interesting.

1129
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:45,283
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be doing some new innovative judging and ranking of that tournament, so check it out.

1130
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:54,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming up, we've got the Cyber Beat Nation Tournament in LA.

1131
01:17:54,935 --> 01:17:57,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be February 14th through the 16th.

1132
01:17:57,836 --> 01:18:01,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Thursday through a Saturday, if I'm not mistaken.

1133
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:04,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio will be covering this tournament, for sure.

1134
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:08,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to make it to Milpitas on Friday.

1135
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I don't think you're going to be able to go because you've got work.

1136
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:11,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the work thing.

1137
01:18:11,885 --> 01:18:12,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you too, right?

1138
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:16,018
[SPEAKER_03]: We all work, unfortunately, so we can't get there in time.

1139
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not going to be able to cover Milpitas.

1140
01:18:18,742 --> 01:18:27,635
[SPEAKER_03]: But if any of you fans out there listening to the show got yourself a tape recorder and a microphone, go talk to some people for us and send me stuff.

1141
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:28,136
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

1142
01:18:29,346 --> 01:18:32,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyber Beat Nation in L.A., February 14th through 16th.

1143
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:33,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge, huge tournament.

1144
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: They're giving away a Max 2 machine in freestyle.

1145
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,631
[SPEAKER_03]: They are giving away a Max 2 machine in freestyle.

1146
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple rounds of freestyle they'll be doing.

1147
01:18:40,592 --> 01:18:44,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be on a DDR Extreme machine, the competition, if it's out by them.

1148
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:49,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect Attack, they're going to give away a Beatmania 2DX arcade-style controller for the winner of Perfect Attack.

1149
01:18:50,437 --> 01:18:51,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but they're not calling it Perfect Attack.

1150
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:56,765
[SPEAKER_03]: They're calling it Stepping Category or Stepping Challenge.

1151
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:59,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Stepping Attack, Step Attack, I don't know.

1152
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:00,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm messing it up.

1153
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running through these very quickly.

1154
01:19:02,811 --> 01:19:03,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have a lot of time to...

1155
01:19:05,334 --> 01:19:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Read into detail on this tournament.

1156
01:19:06,395 --> 01:19:11,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want more information on that tournament, it will be coming to DDRspot.com in the next few days.

1157
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:14,240
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to take some pre-registration there, so keep an eye on that.

1158
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:20,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there is a thread in the DDR Freak Torny forum.

1159
01:19:21,485 --> 01:19:27,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Early next year in Fremont, there's going to be a competition at a pizza joint and that's run by one of our fans, DCB.

1160
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:31,552
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a cool guy, so I'm sure that's going to be a kick-butt tourney.

1161
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:36,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of California, I'm trying to find some well-responded-to threads.

1162
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:41,058
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a tournament on December 21st in Baltimore, the town that doesn't listen to Orange Lounge.

1163
01:19:42,054 --> 01:19:49,199
[SPEAKER_03]: According to our rankings, but there is going to be a tournament at East Point Mall on December 21st in Baltimore, so if you're in that area, you should check it out.

1164
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,203
[SPEAKER_03]: December 7th, I know I shouldn't promote that because I don't listen to the show, but you know, you never know.

1165
01:19:56,864 --> 01:20:02,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Springfield has a tournament the other day, so that's already done.

1166
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have results for that yet, my bad.

1167
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:05,750
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1168
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:13,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... There's a dancing stage tournament in Sweden coming up.

1169
01:20:13,544 --> 01:20:13,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1170
01:20:14,204 --> 01:20:14,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be fun.

1171
01:20:15,425 --> 01:20:16,986
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be a fun tournament.

1172
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:18,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to Sweden.

1173
01:20:18,787 --> 01:20:19,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be good.

1174
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's no location.

1175
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:25,512
[SPEAKER_03]: All I gotta say is Swedish chicks and DDR.

1176
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Swedish chicks and DDR.

1177
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:28,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen to that.

1178
01:20:28,694 --> 01:20:29,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1179
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:30,475
[SPEAKER_03]: This, um...

1180
01:20:32,676 --> 01:20:33,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

1181
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like watching... Can I get a hallelujah?

1182
01:20:35,757 --> 01:20:36,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Hallelujah.

1183
01:20:36,637 --> 01:20:37,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I will give you?

1184
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:41,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're talking about DDR tournaments in Sweden, this is what I will give you.

1185
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:52,362
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that have to do with that?

1186
01:20:52,762 --> 01:20:53,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1187
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:56,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1188
01:20:57,063 --> 01:20:57,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweetest chef.

1189
01:20:58,143 --> 01:20:59,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I can squawk like a chicken.

1190
01:21:00,264 --> 01:21:00,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Also...

1191
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a tournament on the 14th of December in Wales, in England.

1192
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be an English tournament.

1193
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my horrible, horrible English accent.

1194
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,691
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Welsh accent is a good bit different.

1195
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:12,151
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

1196
01:21:14,612 --> 01:21:15,072
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1197
01:21:15,112 --> 01:21:16,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Welsh accents are funny to listen to.

1198
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:21,433
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone wants a good example of a Welsh accent, listen to the parrot sketch.

1199
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:24,174
[SPEAKER_16]: John Cleese's character in the parrot sketch.

1200
01:21:24,514 --> 01:21:25,994
[SPEAKER_16]: He is doing a Welsh accent.

1201
01:21:27,586 --> 01:21:28,908
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1202
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:38,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the other side of the ocean.

1203
01:21:40,803 --> 01:21:44,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody just posted in the chat room, really huge, Jabberwocky says, Abba.

1204
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be a cool Swedish term.

1205
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:48,632
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1206
01:21:48,752 --> 01:21:51,414
[SPEAKER_16]: We should probably play some of the erotic ABBA.

1207
01:21:51,734 --> 01:21:53,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a damn good idea.

1208
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: In the next break, we're going to do a tribute to ABBA and Swedish chicks in DDR.

1209
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:05,585
[SPEAKER_03]: In Roanoke Park on December 21st, they're going to be doing a winter charity Perfect Attack tournament for a Red Octane 2 mat.

1210
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:06,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.

1211
01:22:07,186 --> 01:22:08,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, bring canned goods.

1212
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:11,089
[SPEAKER_05]: The charity is for a Red Octane 2 mat.

1213
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:13,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy me a Red Octane 2 mat.

1214
01:22:15,262 --> 01:22:17,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's called the Winter Charity Tournament.

1215
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know... I don't know.

1216
01:22:19,724 --> 01:22:23,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that part of the money goes to buy the mat, and the other part goes to charity.

1217
01:22:23,886 --> 01:22:24,506
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it works.

1218
01:22:24,526 --> 01:22:24,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1219
01:22:25,026 --> 01:22:25,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp.

1220
01:22:28,508 --> 01:22:29,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, you guys.

1221
01:22:29,368 --> 01:22:30,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe... That is another thing.

1222
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:43,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's another tournament that's Red Octane sponsored, because Red Octane owns your soul if you play DDR, and they sponsor every tournament except the ones... From what I heard is Red Octane is actually going to be selling some of their products, like their ignition pads, in GameStops now.

1223
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:44,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh!

1224
01:22:47,193 --> 01:22:49,536
[SPEAKER_16]: I can get confirmation on that, hello.

1225
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:55,962
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, nothing like that's been told to me, and I'm always told everything that happens for bad money in relation to GameStop.

1226
01:23:00,979 --> 01:23:03,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care, I have Metal Stages, so there!

1227
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:06,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were some upcoming tournaments, enjoy.

1228
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:08,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to go to the Swedish one.

1229
01:23:10,263 --> 01:23:14,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go... Yeah, I know, Bikini Babes, yeah.

1230
01:23:14,705 --> 01:23:15,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Big boner.

1231
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:20,808
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, playing DDR with no chess support sucks.

1232
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I can say this safely as the resolution now.

1233
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:25,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's ask a girl about their boobs.

1234
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:26,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie!

1235
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:27,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1236
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow!

1237
01:23:28,515 --> 01:23:31,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it, like, if you were to DDR in the nude, would that really hurt?

1238
01:23:31,897 --> 01:23:32,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you get slapped in the face?

1239
01:23:33,078 --> 01:23:35,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, first of all, I haven't, but I have played in my pajamas.

1240
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:36,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Just imagine it.

1241
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:48,987
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's, imagine having large amounts of your skin pulled away from your flesh and stuffed, and then, imagine jumping up and down like that.

1242
01:23:49,847 --> 01:23:50,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch!

1243
01:23:50,828 --> 01:23:52,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, every boy wants to know this.

1244
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:53,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What's DDR with boobies like?

1245
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:54,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Painful!

1246
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:59,346
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best way to... Do you like having your boobs restrained when you play DDR?

1247
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you want to tie them down?

1248
01:24:03,428 --> 01:24:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Shush.

1249
01:24:04,869 --> 01:24:06,169
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I have to do the quote.

1250
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:07,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Penfold.

1251
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:08,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Shush.

1252
01:24:09,431 --> 01:24:10,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone who gets that is cool.

1253
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:14,373
[SPEAKER_05]: What have we reduced ourselves to?

1254
01:24:17,532 --> 01:24:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried, ladies and gentlemen.

1255
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:20,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, does it hurt being able to play DDR naked?

1256
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:23,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you, like, your balls pop around or something?

1257
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:23,413
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1258
01:24:23,874 --> 01:24:24,114
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1259
01:24:24,774 --> 01:24:27,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually... No.

1260
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:30,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.

1261
01:24:31,715 --> 01:24:34,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my balls aren't D-sized, though, so I would know.

1262
01:24:34,056 --> 01:24:36,937
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even C or B. You need a ball, brah.

1263
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:45,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's got the biggest balls of them all?

1264
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a coconut ball bra.

1265
01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:51,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1266
01:24:51,509 --> 01:24:53,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody in the studio will admit to playing DDR in the nude.

1267
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:55,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

1268
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody in the studio is going to admit to playing DDR in the nude.

1269
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:59,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, I don't play DDR at home.

1270
01:24:59,691 --> 01:25:03,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That involves pulling out 45-pound stages, setting them on the ground.

1271
01:25:04,051 --> 01:25:04,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what?

1272
01:25:04,612 --> 01:25:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take the extra time to strip down naked to play DDR in my front room.

1273
01:25:08,552 --> 01:25:09,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell do they do that?

1274
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:10,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

1275
01:25:13,493 --> 01:25:16,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to mention that that room is actually kind of small.

1276
01:25:16,435 --> 01:25:17,516
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got furniture in there.

1277
01:25:18,477 --> 01:25:23,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the dogs running around, you know, you're stepping on the fucking chihuahua.

1278
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, it's not a pretty picture.

1279
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Brad's back in the room.

1280
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, have you ever played DDR in the nude?

1281
01:25:29,605 --> 01:25:31,086
[SPEAKER_23]: That's for me to know and you to find out.

1282
01:25:33,648 --> 01:25:35,329
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, actually, honestly, no, I haven't.

1283
01:25:35,389 --> 01:25:36,150
[SPEAKER_23]: I've thought about it.

1284
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:38,811
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought about doing intercourse while playing DDR, too.

1285
01:25:39,572 --> 01:25:40,493
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be interesting.

1286
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,540
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a whole new meaning to the couple dance.

1287
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had somebody in the chatroom admit to doing it at home.

1288
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:50,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Bombay plays DDR in the nude at home.

1289
01:25:50,205 --> 01:25:53,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I definitely can believe that, yeah.

1290
01:25:54,468 --> 01:25:56,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Why am I not surprised?

1291
01:25:57,411 --> 01:25:58,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Why am I scared?

1292
01:26:00,093 --> 01:26:02,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Ow, my freaking ears!

1293
01:26:05,657 --> 01:26:07,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody else admitting to playing DDR in the nude?

1294
01:26:08,059 --> 01:26:08,659
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nobody else.

1295
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1296
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:12,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I've played DDR in my pajamas before, though.

1297
01:26:13,412 --> 01:26:13,893
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that?

1298
01:26:14,634 --> 01:26:15,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Painful.

1299
01:26:15,855 --> 01:26:16,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it breezy?

1300
01:26:17,957 --> 01:26:25,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, seeing as how my pajamas usually consist of big flannel pants and a tank top, then no, not very.

1301
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1302
01:26:28,107 --> 01:26:29,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to stop being perverted now.

1303
01:26:30,409 --> 01:26:31,430
[SPEAKER_16]: In my old house in the hood.

1304
01:26:32,515 --> 01:26:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's your old house in the hood.

1305
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:34,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Your house in the hood was cool.

1306
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:36,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1307
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:39,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Oh, yes.

1308
01:26:39,999 --> 01:26:40,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to make the announcement.

1309
01:26:40,839 --> 01:26:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to be doing the cage match tonight because last week's song didn't get in until very late in the week and we have the marathon going on all weekend long so it's not hardly getting played at all.

1310
01:26:50,784 --> 01:26:52,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, we don't have all of our regular listeners.

1311
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:55,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight's cage match is postponed.

1312
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:59,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, can we put both in the rotation?

1313
01:26:59,668 --> 01:26:59,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh!

1314
01:27:03,194 --> 01:27:03,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

1315
01:27:04,295 --> 01:27:04,835
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can't.

1316
01:27:04,895 --> 01:27:05,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

1317
01:27:05,995 --> 01:27:11,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, let's see, I'm trying to find my ABBA covers, and I think I only have one.

1318
01:27:12,578 --> 01:27:14,539
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good one, so we will play that one.

1319
01:27:16,419 --> 01:27:17,099
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can find it.

1320
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when we do come back from this break...

1321
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:25,193
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to do the FUs of the week.

1322
01:27:25,313 --> 01:27:28,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So send those to me over private message in the channel right now.

1323
01:27:28,636 --> 01:27:29,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Or email them.

1324

[SPEAKER_03]: Or email them to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1325
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do all of your FUs of the week right after this break.

1326
01:28:30,298 --> 01:28:44,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It was my only fight Now it isn't true Now everything is new And all I've learned has overturned I lack of you Don't go wasting your emotion

1327
01:28:57,443 --> 01:28:58,988

DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1338
01:37:12,972 --> 01:37:15,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Bitch, get a new song.

1339
01:37:15,674 --> 01:37:19,277
[SPEAKER_11]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1340
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:44,832
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a special taped edition.

1341
01:37:45,632 --> 01:37:53,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, we are taping on Saturday, but we've got a lot of people, a lot of our regulars are joining us here on Saturday night, but if unfortunately you weren't able to listen until Sunday night, that's okay too.

1342
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:54,237
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgive you.

1343
01:37:55,278 --> 01:37:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all going out and getting a life this week, so we had to change a few things.

1344
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:03,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Now comes that part of the show that's everybody's favorite.

1345
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:07,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, please explain the FU of the week, why it was created, what it's here for.

1346
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:09,868
[SPEAKER_16]: We're pissed and we're not going to take it anymore.

1347
01:38:10,088 --> 01:38:11,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to take it.

1348
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:13,910
[SPEAKER_16]: No!

1349
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:16,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1350
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:17,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what my new F.U.

1351
01:38:17,211 --> 01:38:17,852
[SPEAKER_03]: song is going to be.

1352
01:38:17,872 --> 01:38:18,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit.

1353
01:38:18,472 --> 01:38:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with Bomani.

1354
01:38:19,712 --> 01:38:20,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the song I want.

1355
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:21,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1356
01:38:22,634 --> 01:38:22,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1357
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:24,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1358
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:27,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's going to start it off because she's the most angsty.

1359
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:29,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1360
01:38:29,517 --> 01:38:30,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

1361
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:31,378
[SPEAKER_03]: The F.U.s of the week.

1362
01:38:33,724 --> 01:38:37,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the first thing that gets the big fuck you is my computer.

1363
01:38:38,668 --> 01:38:39,748
[SPEAKER_16]: My hard drive died.

1364
01:38:40,369 --> 01:38:41,269
[SPEAKER_16]: As in, broken.

1365
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,131
[SPEAKER_16]: As in, it wouldn't even reformat.

1366
01:38:45,312 --> 01:38:54,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, my computer wouldn't boot one morning, so as Dan was off work, so he was gonna put the restore disk in and fix everything and make it happy again, and it did make it happy.

1367
01:38:54,799 --> 01:38:56,800
[SPEAKER_16]: It said, C drive is damaged.

1368
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:57,421
[SPEAKER_16]: What?! !

1369
01:38:58,603 --> 01:39:01,190
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm sitting here going, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, all day at work.

1370
01:39:02,634 --> 01:39:05,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, as it turned out, I did have to buy a new hard drive.

1371
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:14,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Although, the good thing that came out of this is I now have a 120GB hard drive with the 8MB cache, so it's pretty cool.

1372
01:39:16,011 --> 01:39:24,915
[SPEAKER_16]: But still, I lost about 60GB worth of information and some photographs that I can't get replaced because my mom's ex-husband destroyed them.

1373
01:39:25,675 --> 01:39:26,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you, Michael.

1374
01:39:27,116 --> 01:39:30,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, not her current husband, Michael, but her ex-husband, Michael.

1375
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:31,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Her current husband's cool.

1376
01:39:31,878 --> 01:39:32,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, that's the best point.

1377
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:33,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

1378
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:40,484
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just distressing because I have, like I said, a lot of stuff on there that I just can't get again.

1379
01:39:42,205 --> 01:39:45,246
[SPEAKER_16]: And the ironic thing is that I was going to be backing everything up today.

1380
01:39:46,047 --> 01:39:47,508
[SPEAKER_16]: So, that sucks.

1381
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:51,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

1382
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your only... Is that an RO again?

1383
01:39:53,391 --> 01:39:53,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1384
01:39:54,812 --> 01:39:55,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Minecraft Online.

1385
01:39:57,113 --> 01:39:57,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1386
01:39:58,154 --> 01:40:00,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Dad, there's nobody for me to play Phantasy Star Online with.

1387
01:40:00,775 --> 01:40:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I can, I will.

1388
01:40:01,856 --> 01:40:03,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm buying that game as soon as it comes out.

1389
01:40:03,216 --> 01:40:04,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as soon as I can get it.

1390
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:05,971
[SPEAKER_03]: All right?

1391
01:40:06,472 --> 01:40:06,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1392
01:40:06,772 --> 01:40:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Matt.

1393
01:40:07,533 --> 01:40:07,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's turn.

1394
01:40:11,776 --> 01:40:26,208
[SPEAKER_05]: My first idea goes to the creators of DDR Max 2 and the fact that they have to program it so complexly that a simple peon like myself, who has no programming knowledge whatsoever, can't hack it.

1395
01:40:26,268 --> 01:40:26,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1396
01:40:27,714 --> 01:40:30,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Why won't you let me mess with it like everyone else does?

1397
01:40:31,575 --> 01:40:37,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so, yeah, FU to the stupid Max2Discs, because, uh, suck, and I can't do anything with them.

1398
01:40:37,816 --> 01:40:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, FU to Subsplash, even though I'm going there tonight, um, for having all their games broken, because they don't give a damn.

1399
01:40:44,437 --> 01:40:54,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And FU the fucking kid who was playing Speed Demon all night on Thursday, because they couldn't play Speed Demon because a fucker was taking it over to kick his ass.

1400
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,000
[SPEAKER_05]: FU that stupid kid with Speed Demon.

1401
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:10,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, aside from that, you know, not too much, uh, stuff I'm mad at, other than, you know, stupid people, stupid drivers, uh, people who ask dumb questions, that kind of thing.

1402
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's all.

1403
01:41:15,452 --> 01:41:17,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you for that angsty little rant.

1404
01:41:22,237 --> 01:41:27,578
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes out to people that you go out on dates with that don't return your phone calls.

1405
01:41:28,638 --> 01:41:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: How fucked up is that?

1406
01:41:29,619 --> 01:41:30,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you.

1407
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: My other FU of the week... I don't know if I want to get into it.

1408
01:41:38,641 --> 01:41:41,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another pretty long FU to leave.

1409
01:41:41,241 --> 01:41:43,022
[SPEAKER_03]: My other FU of the week goes to immaturity.

1410
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:56,953
[SPEAKER_03]: and people that try to send cryptic little messages that are really stupid and immature and try to make things into contests that aren't contests, that are much more than contests.

1411
01:42:00,015 --> 01:42:02,076
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to stupid boys.

1412
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:06,059
[SPEAKER_16]: I will second your F you.

1413
01:42:06,139 --> 01:42:07,980
[SPEAKER_16]: I will support you in your F you.

1414
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,661
[SPEAKER_03]: My F you goes to stupid boys.

1415
01:42:09,801 --> 01:42:10,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1416
01:42:11,522 --> 01:42:15,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take the chatroom's F you's, shall we?

1417
01:42:19,093 --> 01:42:23,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Rogue says, Fuck Euromix 2 for having Steps songs.

1418
01:42:23,997 --> 01:42:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

1419
01:42:25,358 --> 01:42:26,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Steps did tragedy.

1420
01:42:26,478 --> 01:42:27,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That song is fucking rad.

1421
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what you say.

1422
01:42:29,901 --> 01:42:33,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Any song that has a groovy little dance to go with it, rules.

1423
01:42:33,744 --> 01:42:35,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But those other Steps songs, yeah, they all suck.

1424
01:42:35,425 --> 01:42:35,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1425
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: USFVB says,

1426
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:46,254
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to traffic and to people with microwaves creating interference which disabled my telepathic waves from reaching Jamie to answer Propel.

1427
01:42:46,974 --> 01:42:49,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck you to all those people now trying to use Propel as an adjective.

1428
01:42:51,836 --> 01:42:55,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck you to Orange Lounge for what seems to be porn talk prohibition.

1429
01:42:56,217 --> 01:42:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: When do we ever stop talking about porn on here?

1430
01:42:58,778 --> 01:43:00,179
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think we've had an increase in it.

1431
01:43:00,419 --> 01:43:04,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I've got more I can talk to you about that later.

1432
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,361
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're banned.

1433
01:43:09,703 --> 01:43:14,245
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeBeanie says, F you to Naoki for getting to spend so much time for Politary.

1434
01:43:14,906 --> 01:43:17,487
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeBeanie, by the way, actually being a Politary fan.

1435
01:43:18,868 --> 01:43:21,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to The Point for making my 5th mix streams dead.

1436
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:22,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead, I tell you.

1437
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,611
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to The Point.

1438
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:25,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Crestview, they have to...

1439
01:43:28,357 --> 01:43:28,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my lord.

1440
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:31,678
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd Magus says, I have a continued FU to Nori Nori Nori.

1441
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:36,119
[SPEAKER_03]: As usual, a big FU to being broke, which eliminates my chances of going to Scandi RVGL until January.

1442
01:43:36,179 --> 01:43:38,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Cough, donate to the United Magus College Fund.

1443
01:43:38,559 --> 01:43:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And a family-sized FU to Nero's Interface.

1444
01:43:40,579 --> 01:43:44,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I accidentally moved a folder while making a CD and produced five coasters until I found out what happened.

1445
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you ahead.

1446
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:47,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Your program sucks, you bitches.

1447
01:43:47,801 --> 01:43:49,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Go learn English, you fuckers.

1448
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:52,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm punishing you with those FUs for not agreeing with me in the match game.

1449
01:43:52,942 --> 01:43:53,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, suffer.

1450
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:05,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Brack2000 says F you to Captain Jack for not doing a cover of Oh Nick Please Not So Quick I agree, I agree

1451
01:44:07,745 --> 01:44:09,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang, lots of FUs from Stresa.

1452
01:44:10,186 --> 01:44:10,686
[SPEAKER_03]: FU'd who?

1453
01:44:10,866 --> 01:44:11,387
[SPEAKER_03]: His ex.

1454
01:44:11,527 --> 01:44:13,307
[SPEAKER_03]: She dumped me the day after my 20th birthday.

1455
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:15,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're still so hung up on each other and she's killing me.

1456
01:44:15,809 --> 01:44:16,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll survive.

1457
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:19,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd also like to throw an FU at my parents.

1458
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:22,552
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been plotting against me to kick out since June.

1459
01:44:22,652 --> 01:44:25,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to shove a horse-sized FU in my mommy's booty.

1460
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:29,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does my mom deserve a horse-sized FU, especially in the booty?

1461
01:44:29,334 --> 01:44:32,176
[SPEAKER_03]: For finding ways to throw my flaws back in my face for childish reasons.

1462
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:32,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my.

1463
01:44:34,153 --> 01:44:38,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad Sally Jessie's not still around, because that would sound like something you need to go talk to Sally Jessie about.

1464
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:41,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you could go to Dr. Phil.

1465
01:44:45,163 --> 01:44:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Twen says, F you, within 30 minutes I found out the girl I love got into a major car accident and is engaged and has a two-year-old and a six-month son.

1466
01:44:53,999 --> 01:44:55,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check the old mailbag.

1467
01:45:15,987 --> 01:45:19,009
[SPEAKER_03]: because some people sent in their FUs because they knew we wouldn't be on on Sunday.

1468
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:23,872
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower says, For the third week in a row, my main FU still goes to germs.

1469
01:45:23,953 --> 01:45:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: My cough has gotten worse this week and my throat is sore because of it.

1470
01:45:26,915 --> 01:45:31,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, FU to reading boring school books and FU to the dark environments in Metroid Prime.

1471
01:45:31,137 --> 01:45:33,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally can't see a wall that's a few inches away from my face.

1472
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But a very fun game on this.

1473
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,701
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that cough is?

1474
01:45:36,761 --> 01:45:37,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Ebola.

1475
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:38,122
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to die.

1476
01:45:38,382 --> 01:45:38,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1477
01:45:41,385 --> 01:45:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: F-Ebola.

[SPEAKER_03]: To my mom again for getting me a FUBU sweatshirt for Hanukkah, not knowing what FUBU meant.

1481
01:46:22,507 --> 01:46:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: What does FUBU mean?

1482
01:46:23,828 --> 01:46:24,769
[SPEAKER_16]: For us by us.

1483
01:46:25,929 --> 01:46:26,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, see you guys next Sunday.

1487

[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

01:46:43,294 --> 01:46:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: What song?

1491
01:46:44,055 --> 01:46:45,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Speed Over Beethoven?

1492
01:46:45,897 --> 01:46:48,479
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I always give the chatroom shitty songs to their FUs.

1493
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:50,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, EOSFBB sent us one more.

1494
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:55,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to VidPower for being conscious of the fact that he is sick, yet still serving food in his restaurant.

1495
01:46:56,727 --> 01:46:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, yikes.

1496
01:46:58,889 --> 01:46:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.

1497
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:00,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, kill the song.

1498
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,301
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our lovely F-Use of the Week.

1499
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:05,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for participating.

1500
01:47:05,622 --> 01:47:06,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We do appreciate it.

1501
01:47:06,582 --> 01:47:07,403
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me.

1502
01:47:07,743 --> 01:47:08,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1503
01:47:08,503 --> 01:47:11,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do have dates now for Make Edit Get Porn.

1504
01:47:11,745 --> 01:47:12,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

1505
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, let's talk about Make Edit Get Porn.

1506
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:15,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1507
01:47:15,747 --> 01:47:20,549
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem is I don't remember what the dates are right now because I can't remember what I type on these boards.

1508
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:23,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at so many of them every week.

1509
01:47:24,059 --> 01:47:32,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, MakeEditGetPorn, we've got the dates set for it, I believe, if I remember correctly.

1510
01:47:36,265 --> 01:47:40,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to announce the winners on the show, so that's going to be happening.

1511
01:47:43,008 --> 01:47:44,108
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I set the dates at?

1512
01:47:44,168 --> 01:47:44,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1513
01:47:47,367 --> 01:47:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: If I missed your FU of the week, it's because I didn't get it over private message, and I missed things.

1514
01:47:51,791 --> 01:47:51,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1515
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:52,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is.

1516
01:47:52,931 --> 01:47:53,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I see it.

1517
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,994
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, uh, Jabberwocky says, Fuck you, Rob.

1518
01:47:56,314 --> 01:47:57,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

1519
01:47:57,755 --> 01:47:58,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, fuck you?

1520
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you?

1521
01:47:59,397 --> 01:47:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, really.

[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

1525
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:03,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you, babe.

1526
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:03,860

[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking beautiful.

1528
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:06,202
[SPEAKER_03]: A big FU to you, Rob.

1529
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:09,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Dot, dot, dot.

1530
01:48:11,566 --> 01:48:13,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, you were talking about pornography.

1531
01:48:14,368 --> 01:48:20,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all the entries are due by Sunday, December 22nd at midnight.

1532
01:48:21,675 --> 01:48:22,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And where must they submit them?

1533
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:27,840
[SPEAKER_05]: They must send them to my email or give them to me in person.

1534
01:48:28,784 --> 01:48:37,573
[SPEAKER_05]: and they can be in any format as long as there's some way I can see the step file or step chart or have an edit file for it, you know, that's all I really need.

1535
01:48:37,673 --> 01:48:52,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my email, I should probably give it over the air, I guess, nightmare underscore hunter and so it's nightmarehunter at yahoo.com Make sure you put the nice little underscore there between nightmare and hunter.

1536
01:48:53,252 --> 01:48:58,477
[SPEAKER_05]: and other than that, you know, if you're local, you know, give it to me in person.

1537
01:48:58,757 --> 01:49:02,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And all entries will be judged on January the 5th.

1538
01:49:03,402 --> 01:49:04,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's a Sunday.

1539
01:49:04,923 --> 01:49:07,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to be announced right here on Orange Islands Radio, the winners, right?

1540
01:49:07,465 --> 01:49:07,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1541
01:49:07,826 --> 01:49:08,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1542
01:49:08,807 --> 01:49:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have quite a bit of porn to go around, so there might actually be... Now, very briefly, for those new to the show, what is Make Edit Get Porned?

1543
01:49:16,994 --> 01:49:17,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Pornography

1544
01:49:33,195 --> 01:49:35,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Pornotapes Yay!

1545
01:49:35,477 --> 01:50:02,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have make, edit, get porn Just like the title says And you'll get a big box of, you know, pornotapes Pretty much it consists of mostly Playboy movies I mean, I don't really consider them porn They're kind of Skinamax, they're prawn They're kind of porn, but they're not, I don't know It's hard to say But, you know, you'll get those And, I mean, those are pretty expensive, actually They're about $22.98 a piece So you are saving quite a bit of money To go out and buy those tapes and find out that they're crap

1546
01:50:04,128 --> 01:50:07,111
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya is wondering if you ever did get any boy-on-boy mix porn.

1547
01:50:08,612 --> 01:50:10,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not myself, no.

1548
01:50:12,896 --> 01:50:13,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

1549
01:50:13,677 --> 01:50:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that he's interested, he just wants to know.

[SPEAKER_03]: Boy-on-boy porn, Jamie.

1552
01:50:21,264 --> 01:50:23,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, what happens if a woman who wins may get to get porn?

1553
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:31,857
[SPEAKER_03]: If a woman wins Make It or Get Porn, then we'll just have to find some boy porn to throw in the box.

1554
01:50:32,378 --> 01:50:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pun intended.

1555
01:50:36,481 --> 01:50:43,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, that's going on, and like I said, you've got no time to do it.

1556
01:50:44,107 --> 01:50:49,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So get your Trinity Mix 3 stuff done this week, and then get your Make It or Get Porn stuff done next week.

1557
01:50:50,908 --> 01:50:52,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was Make It or Get Porn.

[SPEAKER_03]: Or how about let's hear a clip of Ode to Joy.

1580
01:52:26,354 --> 01:52:29,336
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Beethoven song, so let's hear this clip of Ode to Joy.

1581
01:52:29,836 --> 01:52:30,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows this song.

1582
01:52:30,837 --> 01:52:33,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody who ever took piano had to play this song at one point or another.

1583
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Another?

1584
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:34,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear this one.

1585
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,522

[SPEAKER_03]: Ode to Joy

1587
01:52:49,711 --> 01:52:50,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

1588
01:52:50,212 --> 01:52:55,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody in the chatroom says, oh, that's kind of like End of the Century.

1589
01:52:56,016 --> 01:52:56,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

1590
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:11,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1591
01:53:12,982 --> 01:53:16,043
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, End of the Century is kind of like Ode to Joy, get it right.

1592
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit similar, yes.

1593
01:53:18,323 --> 01:53:21,144
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a brand new Captain Jack album coming out.

1594

01:53:22,805 --> 01:53:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Party Warriors.

1596
01:53:25,126 --> 01:53:26,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking rock, that's all I had to say.

1597
01:53:27,226 --> 01:53:30,848
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have a clip of one song, but it's got a great name, so I'm sure it's awesome.

1598
01:53:31,268 --> 01:53:33,148
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a song called Centerfold.

1599
01:53:33,469 --> 01:53:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, it looks like this album is just a bunch of remixes.

1600
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:40,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got Hey Ya, Iko Iko, Party Warriors, and this one, Centerfold.

1601
01:53:43,467 --> 01:53:44,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's back!

1602
01:53:44,508 --> 01:53:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, that's just centerfold.

1603
01:53:46,749 --> 01:53:47,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Go Captain!

1604
01:53:47,329 --> 01:53:50,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Go Captain!

1605
01:53:51,171 --> 01:53:51,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Go Captain!

1606
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:56,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that was centerfold.

1607
01:53:56,933 --> 01:53:59,174
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of a clip there.

1608
01:53:59,315 --> 01:54:00,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And also coming out,

[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to scare a lot of you.

1611
01:54:19,694 --> 01:54:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: The very first track is Nancy and the Boys.

1612
01:54:24,675 --> 01:54:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're covering everybody's favorite artist these days.

1613
01:54:29,377 --> 01:54:31,598
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a cover of an Avril Lavigne song.

1614
01:54:31,838 --> 01:54:32,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear how awful it is.

1615
01:54:57,398 --> 01:55:04,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be on a Speed album, Jesus.

1616
01:55:04,203 --> 01:55:08,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the OSFVB wants a cover of Dirty on Speed 10.

1617
01:55:08,146 --> 01:55:09,507
[SPEAKER_03]: No, unfortunately that's not going to happen.

1618
01:55:09,927 --> 01:55:11,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do get some other cool stuff.

1619
01:55:11,228 --> 01:55:12,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Little Less Conversation.

1620
01:55:12,809 --> 01:55:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Elvis song that made a big comeback.

1621
01:55:15,811 --> 01:55:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a clip of that.

1622
01:55:16,872 --> 01:55:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the second track on the album.

1623
01:55:18,493 --> 01:55:19,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Done by CJ Crew.

1624
01:55:19,374 --> 01:55:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Done by the CJ Crew, who did some...

1625
01:55:24,121 --> 01:55:32,626
[SPEAKER_06]: All this aggravation and satisfaction A little fight, a little less fun A little less fun and a little more snot Put your mouth in the oven of your heart That is fun, that is fun, baby, baby

1628
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:15,001
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be in for some real hell on Speed 10.

1629
01:56:15,041 --> 01:56:16,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a cover of the Brian Adams song.

1635
01:56:35,107 --> 01:56:35,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this song.

1636
01:56:35,787 --> 01:56:40,989
[SPEAKER_07]: This is probably going to be a big PDR.

1637
01:56:41,049 --> 01:56:43,150
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like totally BDM.

1638
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is total PDR song right here.

1639
01:56:49,912 --> 01:57:02,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, Love Unlimited, Candy Plants Yes, and another remix of Candy, just what the fucking world needed Get up and move, speed mix Love Sex on the Beach, I love Erotic

1640
01:57:03,678 --> 01:57:09,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some new things that we can look forward to from the Toshiba EMI series.

1641
01:57:09,182 --> 01:57:10,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out very soon.

1642
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:15,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we never really talked about it, let's talk about some other things that we've had come out recently.

1643
01:57:15,847 --> 01:57:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Mania EX1 just came out not too long ago.

1644
01:57:18,569 --> 01:57:19,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Had some good stuff on it.

1645
01:57:21,891 --> 01:57:25,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The Return of Smile DK, Captain Jack, and Erotic all on a Dance Mania album.

1646
01:57:25,494 --> 01:57:26,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

1647
01:57:26,435 --> 01:57:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lollipop.

1648
01:57:27,515 --> 01:57:30,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I do have Lollipop on my CD that I brought today.

1649
01:57:30,578 --> 01:57:31,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to listen to that.

1650
01:57:32,739 --> 01:57:36,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be perfectly happy if I don't have to hear that song, thank you.

1651
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:37,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds scary.

1652
01:57:49,168 --> 01:57:51,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird, I didn't realize people left the house here.

1653
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:54,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had somebody come online who I thought was here at the house.

1654
01:57:54,412 --> 01:58:00,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's... I guess we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to do a list list.

1655
01:58:01,317 --> 01:58:02,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we have enough people to do a list list.

1656
01:58:02,818 --> 01:58:03,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we still have one person here?

1657
01:58:03,719 --> 01:58:04,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we still have anybody here?

1658
01:58:04,999 --> 01:58:08,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she's still playing... Animal Crossing?

1659
01:58:08,542 --> 01:58:10,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if we have enough people to do a list list.

1660
01:58:11,864 --> 01:58:12,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to do that.

1661
01:58:12,965 --> 01:58:13,866
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, we'll think of something.

1662
01:58:14,026 --> 01:58:15,887
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just do a three-person list list if we have to.

1663
01:58:17,348 --> 01:58:18,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do a three-person list list if we have to.

1664
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1665
01:58:19,951 --> 01:58:24,435
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and I had a request for something, and I don't even remember what it was.

1666
01:58:24,796 --> 01:58:26,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I could talk about new tech porn.

1667
01:58:26,598 --> 01:58:27,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants to play Holic?

1668
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:30,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, talk about what you wanted to talk about.

1669
01:58:31,122 --> 01:58:36,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I'm going to go see if we have anybody else in the front room to do... I get the chair.

1670
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:37,488
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you don't.

1671
01:58:37,548 --> 01:58:38,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I get the chair.

1672
01:58:39,741 --> 01:58:40,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

1673
01:58:41,142 --> 01:58:41,762
[SPEAKER_16]: See you next time.

1674
01:59:07,389 --> 01:59:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: He's telling us about his porn.

1675
01:59:08,369 --> 01:59:08,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1676
01:59:35,225 --> 01:59:37,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, reviewing anime porn here, Rob.

1677
01:59:38,527 --> 01:59:44,130
[SPEAKER_05]: DNA Hunter, it's basically about, there's this woman, her husband dies, and she really wants to have a baby.

1678
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:46,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem is, she wants to have her husband's baby.

1679
01:59:46,711 --> 01:59:50,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in order to do that, she has to kind of clone his DNA or something like that.

1680
01:59:50,173 --> 01:59:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so in order to get the money to do this, she has to become a DNA Hunter.

1681
01:59:54,055 --> 01:59:58,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what DNA Hunter is, is basically, it's a woman, women come to this company,

1682
01:59:59,318 --> 02:00:01,520
[SPEAKER_05]: and they say, I want this man's baby.

1683
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to do that, they have to have these women that work for this company go and have sex with these people.

1684
02:00:07,885 --> 02:00:16,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they collect the DNA, or semen, from these people and then turn cell to the women that want to have those, you know, celebrities' babies.

1685
02:00:17,552 --> 02:00:18,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Thus, DNA Hunter.

1686
02:00:19,474 --> 02:00:21,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say that this was an utter disappointment.

1687
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:23,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Title sucked ass.

1688
02:00:23,837 --> 02:00:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Leatherman Vol. 3

1689
02:00:47,896 --> 02:00:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty interesting title since I had to start watching it in the middle.

1690
02:00:53,139 --> 02:00:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically this guy carrying around a sack of money.

1691
02:00:56,541 --> 02:01:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why he's carrying around a sack of money because obviously I haven't seen the first episode so I don't really know.

1692
02:01:01,064 --> 02:01:02,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's going around and

1693
02:01:03,545 --> 02:01:06,346
[SPEAKER_05]: People just start having sex with them for no apparent reason whatsoever.

1694
02:01:06,386 --> 02:01:11,907
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to steal the money, and it's kind of like Golden Boy, but X-rated.

1695
02:01:12,367 --> 02:01:17,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the guy, he's making women feel better about themselves, giving them more confidence and stuff.

1696
02:01:17,408 --> 02:01:20,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he has sex with them and stuff like that.

1697
02:01:20,369 --> 02:01:22,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's pretty good.

1698
02:01:22,549 --> 02:01:24,750
[SPEAKER_05]: No real plot to get in the way, lots of sex.

1699
02:01:24,890 --> 02:01:26,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun, fun, fun.

1700
02:01:27,683 --> 02:01:32,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one, I believe it was called Katie, I can't remember what the actual name was.

1701
02:01:33,406 --> 02:01:53,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about this kind of cheerleader, not really a cheerleader, but she's like the head of the kind of the pep team or whatever, and she is being blackmailed by the rest of her team to do all these things like, you know, do cheers with like a vibrator strapped in her and stuff, and

1702
02:01:54,216 --> 02:02:05,827
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of stuff like that she ends up at the very end turning into a slut so you get to watch this cute girl get transformed into a slut at the end of the movie so of course everyone likes that that's it, that's all I've got

1703
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

1704
02:02:07,891 --> 02:02:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back to talk about something Bomani related.

1705
02:02:11,834 --> 02:02:12,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, maybe.

1706
02:02:12,855 --> 02:02:14,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we're going to do a list list when we come back.

1707
02:02:14,676 --> 02:02:18,039
[SPEAKER_03]: By request, this break, this is the only song we're going to play this break because it's kind of long.

1708
02:02:18,099 --> 02:02:19,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's six minutes long, but it's very cool.

1709
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Outphase doing .59 live.

1710
02:02:23,443 --> 02:02:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So it starts off a little bit quiet, though, so don't think that we dropped or anything.

1711
02:02:26,766 --> 02:02:27,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has a quiet intro.

1712
02:02:27,706 --> 02:02:29,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got one of those windy noises things.

1713
02:02:29,828 --> 02:02:31,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy this song and we'll be back.

1714
02:02:36,826 --> 02:02:37,967

1743
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:32,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Goddy Christmas decorations.

1744
02:10:35,595 --> 02:10:40,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you know, the white trash light setups, you know, in front of people's houses.

1745
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:46,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaudy Christmas Decorations is number three on... Doesn't it look like Christmas threw up all over the houses?

1746
02:10:47,645 --> 02:10:48,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1747
02:10:48,486 --> 02:10:53,430
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just driving down the street the other day, and Jamie said, Christmas barfed on that house.

1748
02:10:53,530 --> 02:10:55,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas barfed on that house.

1749
02:10:56,412 --> 02:10:59,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Gaudy Christmas Decorations is Loki's number three answer.

1750
02:10:59,254 --> 02:11:00,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Rice Princess in the studio.

1751
02:11:00,535 --> 02:11:01,856
[SPEAKER_03]: She's helping us out tonight with listless...

1752
02:11:03,017 --> 02:11:06,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, what is your number three pick for thing you hate about Christmas?

1753
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:11,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you have to say dumb, nosy relatives.

1754
02:11:12,803 --> 02:11:17,706
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when you have to see those relatives you never see but Christmas time, and they always want to know what you're doing.

1755
02:11:17,746 --> 02:11:19,707
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, well, if I wanted you to know, I would have told you.

1756
02:11:19,727 --> 02:11:22,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have sent you a letter or called you or something.

1757
02:11:22,489 --> 02:11:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Dumb, nosy relatives, Irene's number three answer.

1758
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:26,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice, very nice.

1759
02:11:26,171 --> 02:11:26,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1760
02:11:26,931 --> 02:11:29,253
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three answer would be parking lots.

1761
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:36,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate parking lots normally, and around Christmas time, it gets ten times as worse.

1762
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:47,094
[SPEAKER_03]: People cannot drive in a parking lot, they are cutthroat going for each other's spaces, they stay and they park their car in the middle of the aisle, so when you're trying to go around to get a spot, you're trapped there.

1763
02:11:47,414 --> 02:11:49,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit pisses me off more than anything else in the whole world.

1764
02:11:52,696 --> 02:11:55,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your number three pick for something you hate about Christmas.

1765
02:11:55,957 --> 02:11:57,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Decorations going up before Halloween.

1766
02:11:58,137 --> 02:12:00,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, decorations that go up before Halloween.

1767
02:12:00,478 --> 02:12:00,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

1768
02:12:05,373 --> 02:12:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: What about decorations that stay up after Valentine's Day?

1769
02:12:08,517 --> 02:12:12,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what to feel about that.

1770
02:12:12,321 --> 02:12:14,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't like them going up before my favorite holiday.

1771
02:12:15,084 --> 02:12:15,365
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1772
02:12:15,445 --> 02:12:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: What if there are orange lights, though?

1773
02:12:18,088 --> 02:12:19,530
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's for Halloween, then sure.

1774
02:12:20,322 --> 02:12:20,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1775
02:12:21,643 --> 02:12:22,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1776
02:12:23,444 --> 02:12:27,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your number two answer for thing that pisses you off about Christmas.

1777
02:12:27,486 --> 02:12:28,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas music.

1778
02:12:29,887 --> 02:12:30,367
[SPEAKER_05]: All of it.

1779
02:12:30,607 --> 02:12:31,628
[SPEAKER_05]: All of it must go.

1780
02:12:32,468 --> 02:12:34,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't change your music programming.

1781
02:12:35,069 --> 02:12:36,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill the artists that made it.

1782
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Hunt them down.

1783
02:12:37,831 --> 02:12:39,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I will pay ransom.

1784
02:12:40,572 --> 02:12:41,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, bounty.

1785
02:12:41,373 --> 02:12:44,014
[SPEAKER_05]: A bounty for everybody that makes Christmas music.

1786
02:12:44,654 --> 02:12:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them all dead.

1787
02:12:46,955 --> 02:12:47,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1788
02:12:48,296 --> 02:12:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Christmas music.

1789
02:12:50,356 --> 02:12:51,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene, your number two answer.

1790
02:12:51,957 --> 02:12:55,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Having no money or resources to buy or make gifts.

1791
02:12:57,799 --> 02:12:57,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1792
02:12:59,359 --> 02:12:59,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Sucks.

1793
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to elaborate on there?

1794
02:13:04,241 --> 02:13:05,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, no.

1795
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:06,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1796
02:13:08,442 --> 02:13:11,423
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two answer is political correctness.

1797
02:13:15,464 --> 02:13:22,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Because somewhere right now there's probably somebody that would be whining about how we shouldn't say Christmas because it's the winter holiday season.

1798
02:13:22,690 --> 02:13:24,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody celebrates something different.

1799
02:13:24,231 --> 02:13:24,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1800
02:13:25,072 --> 02:13:27,474
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some people out there that don't even celebrate holidays.

1801
02:13:27,954 --> 02:13:28,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

1802
02:13:29,516 --> 02:13:33,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Christmas, for all practical purposes, means everything, okay?

1803
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:36,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not like a Bible-thumper religious person, but I just say Christmas.

1804
02:13:37,382 --> 02:13:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's presents, you get stuff.

1805
02:13:38,603 --> 02:13:42,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what other people celebrate, but don't freaking get all huffy and puffy when...

1806
02:13:43,442 --> 02:13:51,347
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else, you know, celebrate something you don't you don't have to try so damn hard to be different just go with it I hate political correctness

1807
02:13:54,067 --> 02:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that kind of triggered this was that we have this thing at work that we do every winter and we're not even allowed to call it, we can't call it a Christmas party, we can't call it a Hanukkah party, we can't call it a Kwanzaa party, we can't even call it a holiday party because not everyone celebrates holidays.

1808
02:14:09,031 --> 02:14:12,091
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to call it a winter appreciation party.

1809
02:14:13,672 --> 02:14:15,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so stupid.

1810
02:14:16,072 --> 02:14:18,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, your number two thing that you hate about Christmas.

1811
02:14:22,436 --> 02:14:25,859
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one that's more personal, so I'm not going to say that one.

1812
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:26,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1813
02:14:27,681 --> 02:14:28,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll mention it.

1814
02:14:28,502 --> 02:14:33,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like being away from my family for the fourth Christmas in a row, since they're all out in Alabama.

1815
02:14:33,987 --> 02:14:35,428
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll put it this way.

1816
02:14:36,129 --> 02:14:43,736
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that what I don't like about the whole holiday season is just how over-commercialized it is.

1817
02:14:44,557 --> 02:14:45,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Over-commercialized, all right.

1818
02:14:48,991 --> 02:15:00,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always buy, buy, buy, buy and people don't seem to realize that there's supposed to be more meaning to the season than just... I mean, I like shopping for gifts and I like giving them because that's just how I am.

1819
02:15:01,342 --> 02:15:08,068
[SPEAKER_16]: But when it's being used as an excuse for more people to put money in their pockets, I don't like that.

1820
02:15:10,711 --> 02:15:13,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's a very good rant, I like that.

1821
02:15:13,492 --> 02:15:26,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, number one thing that pisses you off about Christmas, those people dressed up like Santa Claus outside of grocery stores, outside of malls, everything, working for the Salvation Army.

1822
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:28,617
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the Salvation Army.

1823
02:15:29,277 --> 02:15:33,979
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need my money any time of the year, nor during Christmas, and they aren't getting a penny of it.

1824
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:37,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Grinch.

1825
02:15:39,451 --> 02:15:40,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, Scrooge.

1826
02:15:40,392 --> 02:15:43,557
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you see the three ghosts.

1827
02:15:43,938 --> 02:15:47,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, the number one thing you hate about Christmas?

1828
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:50,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Not knowing what to get people for Christmas.

1829
02:15:51,168 --> 02:15:51,569
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate it.

1830
02:15:52,463 --> 02:15:53,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Just tell me what you want.

1831
02:15:53,764 --> 02:15:54,865
[SPEAKER_16]: What you really, really want.

1832
02:15:55,685 --> 02:15:56,366
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll get it for you.

1833
02:15:56,826 --> 02:15:57,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Not knowing what to get people.

1834
02:15:57,987 --> 02:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1835
02:15:58,887 --> 02:15:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.

1836
02:15:59,808 --> 02:16:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one answer is already on the list.

1837
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:04,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll just say it anyway.

1838
02:16:04,351 --> 02:16:05,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have a duplicate.

1839
02:16:05,712 --> 02:16:08,133
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one thing I hate about Christmas is Christmas carols.

1840
02:16:08,614 --> 02:16:11,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So that goes right along with Christmas music.

1841
02:16:11,095 --> 02:16:13,397
[SPEAKER_16]: You can pick something other than Christmas carols.

1842
02:16:13,437 --> 02:16:14,157
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Christmas carolers?

1843
02:16:14,257 --> 02:16:14,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1844
02:16:21,710 --> 02:16:23,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the beginning of the Addams Family movie.

1845
02:16:24,112 --> 02:16:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best thing ever.

1846
02:16:26,373 --> 02:16:29,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate... Okay, I was going to say you could have used this one.

1847
02:16:29,796 --> 02:16:31,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas TV specials.

1848
02:16:32,998 --> 02:16:34,419
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because the Grinch is cool.

1849
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:35,440
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1850
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about the Grinch.

1851
02:16:37,181 --> 02:16:37,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Grinch is cool.

1852
02:16:38,342 --> 02:16:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep the Grinch.

1853
02:16:39,063 --> 02:16:41,444
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm talking about like they have this one here, it's a musical special.

1854
02:16:41,584 --> 02:16:43,045
[SPEAKER_05]: John Ritter hosting.

1855
02:16:43,726 --> 02:16:45,547
[SPEAKER_05]: John Ritter should not be on TV.

1856
02:16:47,168 --> 02:16:48,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Not since Three's Company anyway.

1857
02:16:49,570 --> 02:16:50,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Three's Company was cool.

1858
02:16:54,633 --> 02:16:56,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, the number one answer.

1859
02:16:56,955 --> 02:16:58,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Misinterpretation of the holiday.

1860
02:16:58,876 --> 02:17:02,299
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to give background.

1861
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:04,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I was born Southern Baptist.

1862
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:10,445
[SPEAKER_16]: I still believe in God in general, but I lean more toward the pagan side of my beliefs.

1863
02:17:11,085 --> 02:17:14,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And I love it when people go, oh, Jesus was born on Christmas Day.

1864
02:17:14,908 --> 02:17:15,849
[SPEAKER_16]: That's bullshit!

1865
02:17:15,869 --> 02:17:18,011
[SPEAKER_16]: He was born in like June, okay?

1866
02:17:18,031 --> 02:17:18,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1867
02:17:18,982 --> 02:17:21,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Christmas is a pagan holiday, okay?

1868
02:17:22,203 --> 02:17:28,144
[SPEAKER_16]: The Yule Tree, the log, you know, the candles, all of it is a pagan holiday.

1869
02:17:28,684 --> 02:17:29,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Get it right.

1870
02:17:30,384 --> 02:17:36,305
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want dates and proof and everything, I can go grab all of my college books and pull that right up where that tradition started.

1871
02:17:36,365 --> 02:17:40,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think that somebody posted a link in the chat room if you want more information on that.

1872
02:17:40,286 --> 02:17:42,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1873
02:17:42,106 --> 02:17:42,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

1874
02:17:42,326 --> 02:17:43,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I am so sick of this.

1875
02:17:44,246 --> 02:17:47,327
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's part of the reason why I stopped going to the specials at church.

1876
02:17:48,067 --> 02:17:48,947
[SPEAKER_16]: was because of this.

1877
02:17:49,707 --> 02:17:51,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Christmas Day, blah, blah, blah.

1878
02:17:51,208 --> 02:17:51,548
[SPEAKER_16]: No!

1879
02:17:51,888 --> 02:17:52,308
[SPEAKER_16]: You're wrong.

1880
02:17:52,348 --> 02:17:52,868
[SPEAKER_16]: You're stupid.

1881
02:17:53,368 --> 02:17:57,389
[SPEAKER_16]: You're buying into what you've been fed all of your life.

1882
02:17:57,589 --> 02:17:59,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Try thinking for yourself.

1883
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:00,990
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like that.

1884
02:18:01,210 --> 02:18:03,090
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's my number one pet peeve about Christmas.

1885
02:18:03,410 --> 02:18:03,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1886
02:18:04,911 --> 02:18:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I just stopped going to church because it was damn boring and I didn't really care.

1887
02:18:08,772 --> 02:18:15,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Except there was this one priest that looked like Weirdo Yankovich and that entertained myself enough to stay away for about half of it.

1888
02:18:15,908 --> 02:18:16,188
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1889
02:18:16,928 --> 02:18:19,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, not a single Bomani-related thing on this list.

1890
02:18:19,249 --> 02:18:20,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really proud of you guys.

1891
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:21,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1892
02:18:22,671 --> 02:18:23,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1893
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:24,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1894
02:18:24,771 --> 02:18:27,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to entertain something here in the studio here.

1895
02:18:27,653 --> 02:18:32,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I feel comfortable eliminating any of these because they're all things that really suck about Christmas.

1896
02:18:32,474 --> 02:18:35,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as a Christmas present, we should let our chat room pick from all of these options.

1897
02:18:35,676 --> 02:18:36,196
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

1898
02:18:36,216 --> 02:18:36,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1899
02:18:37,657 --> 02:18:37,957
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1900
02:18:38,337 --> 02:18:39,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not going to eliminate anything.

1901
02:18:39,598 --> 02:18:41,259
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can pick anything from this list.

1902
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:45,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know about the others, but I don't... We're extra bitter today.

1903
02:18:45,563 --> 02:18:49,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anything on this list that I really feel comfortable getting rid of.

1904
02:18:50,166 --> 02:18:51,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even add to the list.

1905
02:18:51,907 --> 02:18:54,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the stupid people that come around working... No, no adding.

1906
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:58,032
[SPEAKER_05]: The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts wanting me to buy shit.

1907
02:18:59,093 --> 02:19:00,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they made from real Girl Scouts?

1908
02:19:00,434 --> 02:19:00,474
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1909
02:19:02,941 --> 02:19:03,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1910
02:19:03,381 --> 02:19:04,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a cookie.

1911
02:19:05,203 --> 02:19:07,125
[SPEAKER_03]: The Addams Family is like the best Christmas movie.

1912
02:19:07,785 --> 02:19:08,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I want a cookie.

1913
02:19:10,488 --> 02:19:12,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things that the chatroom... Make a real Girl Scouts.

1914
02:19:12,709 --> 02:19:14,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom suggestions that we missed.

1915
02:19:14,771 --> 02:19:15,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Blood chip flavor.

1916
02:19:15,872 --> 02:19:17,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Things in the chatroom that we missed.

1917
02:19:17,834 --> 02:19:18,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Eggnog.

1918
02:19:18,895 --> 02:19:19,395
[SPEAKER_16]: I like eggnog.

1919
02:19:19,415 --> 02:19:20,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I like eggnog too.

1920
02:19:21,117 --> 02:19:22,918
[SPEAKER_16]: I like alcoholic eggnog.

1921
02:19:23,639 --> 02:19:24,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting socks and underwear.

1922
02:19:25,987 --> 02:19:27,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I could use that, okay?

1923
02:19:29,108 --> 02:19:31,049
[SPEAKER_05]: My socks and underwear just disappeared.

1924
02:19:31,189 --> 02:19:33,049
[SPEAKER_05]: They just like, whoa!

1925
02:19:33,109 --> 02:19:34,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn underpants gnomes.

1926
02:19:36,130 --> 02:19:37,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Underpants gnomes.

1927
02:19:37,771 --> 02:19:40,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, what else did they say?

1928
02:19:41,872 --> 02:19:43,072
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying Silent Hill owns you.

1929
02:19:43,092 --> 02:19:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's it.

1930
02:19:44,573 --> 02:19:45,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only two things.

1931
02:19:45,773 --> 02:19:48,514

02:23:25,876 --> 02:23:30,717
Can you hear me forever?

1941
02:23:30,737 --> 02:23:33,978
Do you feel the pain inside of me?

1942
02:23:35,298 --> 02:23:37,959
[SPEAKER_07]: What came through?

1943
02:23:37,979 --> 02:23:39,179
[SPEAKER_07]: When do we leave the air?

1944
02:23:39,199 --> 02:23:39,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Casting by

1945
02:23:54,561 --> 02:24:00,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't catch the stars Can you see me fall apart?

1946
02:24:00,586 --> 02:24:05,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you shame my frozen memories?

1947
02:24:05,329 --> 02:24:07,331
Setting stars Leaving me alone

1948
02:24:51,311 --> 02:24:53,512
I have feelings that I don't like

1949
02:25:40,808 --> 02:25:41,751
Thank you for watching!

[SPEAKER_03]: We indeed do have a list.

1958
02:27:04,956 --> 02:27:05,216
[SPEAKER_16]: We.

1959
02:27:05,876 --> 02:27:06,056
[SPEAKER_16]: We.

1960
02:27:06,737 --> 02:27:06,997
We!

[SPEAKER_16]: I have Propel.

02:27:10,333 --> 02:27:10,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1963
02:27:10,833 --> 02:27:11,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry?

1964
02:27:12,133 --> 02:27:12,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

1965
02:27:12,514 --> 02:27:13,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Barry good?

1966
02:27:13,854 --> 02:27:15,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Very, very, very, very good.

1967
02:27:15,234 --> 02:27:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1968
02:27:16,295 --> 02:27:20,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is the final list of the top three things you all hate about Christmas.

1969
02:27:20,175 --> 02:27:20,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We helped.

1970
02:27:20,836 --> 02:27:21,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You voted.

1971
02:27:21,496 --> 02:27:21,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1972
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: The number three thing that you hate about Christmas is Christmas carolers.

1973
02:27:28,718 --> 02:27:29,478
[SPEAKER_18]: God, they suck.

1974
02:27:29,498 --> 02:27:30,978
[SPEAKER_18]: Ba-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.

1975
02:27:30,998 --> 02:27:31,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Bang!

1976
02:27:33,999 --> 02:27:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: The number two thing you hate about Christmas is that it's over-commercialized.

1977
02:27:39,457 --> 02:27:40,938
[SPEAKER_03]: with Hallmark stamped on the back.

1978
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number one thing that everybody in the chat room and we all hate about Christmas is political correctness.

1979
02:27:51,286 --> 02:27:51,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1980
02:27:52,364 --> 02:27:54,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's correct, spelled with one R. Shut up.

1981
02:27:55,506 --> 02:27:56,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1982
02:27:57,127 --> 02:27:57,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shut up.

1983
02:27:57,908 --> 02:27:58,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1984
02:27:59,809 --> 02:28:03,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying I should use the movie phone voice.

1985
02:28:03,631 --> 02:28:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

1992
02:28:24,974 --> 02:28:25,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people might do that.

1993
02:28:26,376 --> 02:28:26,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Wee!

1994
02:28:27,737 --> 02:28:28,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Talk to me!

1995
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:32,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just ask Mr. Spanky about that.

1996
02:28:33,766 --> 02:28:35,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, we haven't heard from Mr. Spanky yet tonight.

1997
02:28:36,427 --> 02:28:39,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe we're going to do a Mr. Spanky update a little later.

1998
02:28:40,689 --> 02:28:41,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now you're not so sure?

1999
02:28:41,709 --> 02:28:42,710
[SPEAKER_16]: We need good porn tips.

2000
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We need good porn tips?

2001
02:28:44,611 --> 02:28:48,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well we'll get Mr. Spanky back on the show right before it's over.

2002
02:28:48,312 --> 02:28:48,732
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

2003
02:28:48,872 --> 02:28:49,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

2004
02:28:50,213 --> 02:28:53,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you've got to explain, I noticed one FU you left out.

2005
02:28:54,035 --> 02:28:56,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if you talked about it last week.

2006
02:28:56,396 --> 02:28:59,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got these Leet Max 2 shoes, and they're breaking.

2007
02:29:00,337 --> 02:29:01,438
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought these vans.

2008
02:29:01,458 --> 02:29:03,699
[SPEAKER_16]: They're black and they have flames going up the sides.

2009
02:29:04,659 --> 02:29:06,500
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're already starting to tear up.

2010
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:08,861
[SPEAKER_16]: My last pair of vans lasted me like a whole freaking year.

2011
02:29:09,521 --> 02:29:11,382
[SPEAKER_16]: And these are just falling to bits.

2012
02:29:11,642 --> 02:29:14,304
[SPEAKER_16]: So I gotta get new man shoes.

2013
02:29:16,124 --> 02:29:17,885
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm gonna wear these until they die, dammit.

2014
02:29:18,425 --> 02:29:25,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm being asked to read a paper that 23rd Magus wrote that he got an A on.

2015
02:29:25,429 --> 02:29:27,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It better be Bimani related or I'm not gonna do it.

2016
02:29:27,850 --> 02:29:28,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2017
02:29:35,172 --> 02:29:36,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there's an article in the paper.

2018
02:29:36,574 --> 02:29:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about that, Matt.

2019
02:29:38,415 --> 02:29:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck if I know, I haven't read it.

2020
02:29:39,897 --> 02:29:48,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, my friend Eric, also known as Punkknight, he wrote an article in... I don't remember what the magazine is.

2021
02:29:49,245 --> 02:29:50,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a local paper here.

2022
02:29:53,376 --> 02:29:56,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me!

2023
02:29:56,817 --> 02:29:57,877
[SPEAKER_05]: WiredHead, I bet.

2024
02:29:58,478 --> 02:29:59,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

2025
02:29:59,958 --> 02:30:02,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, WiredHead Magazine.

2026
02:30:02,919 --> 02:30:03,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about DDR.

2027
02:30:04,219 --> 02:30:06,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Rob gets quoted on it.

2028
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:07,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, apparently.

2029
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:07,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even seen it yet.

2030
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:08,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to find a copy of it.

2031
02:30:09,741 --> 02:30:15,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there's a few down where my friend works, if you're local, down in Folsom at...

2032
02:30:17,993 --> 02:30:21,555
[SPEAKER_05]: at, um, shit, Pizza Place, um, Ciro's.

2033
02:30:21,755 --> 02:30:28,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Ciro's Pizza Place at, um, Blue Ravine and Prairie City Road.

2034
02:30:28,899 --> 02:30:31,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you're local in Folsom, you can check it out there.

2035
02:30:32,441 --> 02:30:34,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, wherever Wirehead's at.

2036
02:30:34,502 --> 02:30:36,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So, find it, like it, enjoy it.

2037
02:30:36,923 --> 02:30:37,123
[SPEAKER_05]: There.

2038
02:30:39,044 --> 02:30:46,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, while Matt was talking about Wirehead, Jamie is noticing that if you shake a bottle or propel, like, a lot, and then let it sit there, it looks like cum.

2039
02:30:46,148 --> 02:30:46,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha!

2040
02:30:51,334 --> 02:30:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Tasty!

2041
02:30:54,075 --> 02:30:57,957
[SPEAKER_23]: This looks like it could do a lot of damage to some sort of bodily orifice, this Propel bottle.

2042
02:30:58,217 --> 02:31:01,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie, what was your comment as soon as you took a sip of that shaken water?

2043
02:31:01,818 --> 02:31:02,458
[SPEAKER_16]: It ain't salty.

2044
02:31:02,658 --> 02:31:03,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it ain't salty.

2045
02:31:05,308 --> 02:31:06,769
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2046
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:10,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Your HP tastes good.

2047
02:31:10,771 --> 02:31:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2048
02:31:12,412 --> 02:31:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk now.

2049
02:31:13,873 --> 02:31:18,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to read this paper, and it is Bimani-related because it's about Shaft and that tournament.

2050
02:31:18,876 --> 02:31:24,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So 23rd Magus wrote this paper for one of his classes, so I thought we'd read it, and I'll give our little smart-ass comments on it.

2051
02:31:24,419 --> 02:31:24,979
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

2052
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:26,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2053
02:31:28,842 --> 02:31:29,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

2054
02:31:30,022 --> 02:31:31,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading the paper, reading the paper.

2055
02:31:32,028 --> 02:31:32,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Stand by to win.

2056
02:31:33,869 --> 02:31:37,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.

2057
02:31:38,571 --> 02:31:45,973
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite and strangest hobbies is playing Dance Dance Revolution, an arcade game in which you must step on arrow panels in time to the music.

2058
02:31:46,674 --> 02:31:52,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people, such as myself, go further than the game requires, working the arrows into a dance routine.

2059
02:31:52,436 --> 02:31:54,577
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, we freestyle.

2060
02:31:55,637 --> 02:31:58,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently... Not if you're white.

2061
02:31:59,739 --> 02:31:59,999
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2062
02:32:02,594 --> 02:32:03,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep reading.

2063
02:32:03,214 --> 02:32:04,215
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you laughing at?

2064
02:32:05,135 --> 02:32:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy at what?

2065
02:32:11,638 --> 02:32:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Read.

2066
02:32:13,018 --> 02:32:14,539
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I want to know what the joke is.

2067
02:32:14,579 --> 02:32:14,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Read.

2068
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you tell them.

2069
02:32:18,135 --> 02:32:18,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2070
02:32:19,355 --> 02:32:19,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2071
02:32:20,496 --> 02:32:20,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2072
02:32:21,336 --> 02:32:21,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

2073
02:32:22,296 --> 02:32:22,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

2074
02:32:22,836 --> 02:32:23,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

2075
02:32:23,936 --> 02:32:24,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

2076
02:32:24,477 --> 02:32:24,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2077
02:32:25,637 --> 02:32:25,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2078
02:32:26,197 --> 02:32:26,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2079
02:32:26,637 --> 02:32:28,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with 23 Magazine's paper.

2080
02:32:28,618 --> 02:32:33,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy and freestyles.

2081
02:32:33,719 --> 02:32:34,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's freestylers.

2082
02:32:35,959 --> 02:32:38,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The organizers decided to call it Shaft.

2083
02:32:38,660 --> 02:32:41,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

2084
02:32:41,321 --> 02:32:41,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Sacramento.

2085
02:32:42,992 --> 02:32:45,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, oh yeah, Sackbomani hosts another titles tournament.

2086
02:32:45,173 --> 02:32:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you get docked three points for that.

2087
02:32:48,214 --> 02:32:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: He said Sacramento, not Sackbomani, so he gets docked three points.

2088
02:32:52,396 --> 02:32:54,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite witty, if I do say so myself.

2089
02:32:55,918 --> 02:32:56,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2090
02:32:56,398 --> 02:33:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose I should go into detail about the three types of competition and exactly why they are important.

2091
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:06,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen anyone talk in an English paper, well, I suppose I ought to talk about this.

2092
02:33:08,103 --> 02:33:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose I ought to do my assignment.

2093
02:33:12,024 --> 02:33:17,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that way I don't leave non-DDR players, you unfortunate souls, you, in the dust.

2094
02:33:18,546 --> 02:33:20,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Accuracy attack is your standard play of DDR.

2095
02:33:21,387 --> 02:33:24,668
[SPEAKER_03]: The object of the game is to hit every arrow step with the right timing.

2096
02:33:25,208 --> 02:33:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not present during this competition, so you, dear reader, will be spared the agonizing details.

2097
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:31,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Consider yourself lucky.

2098
02:33:33,451 --> 02:33:34,191
[SPEAKER_16]: You did really good on that.

2099
02:33:34,531 --> 02:33:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was kick-ass.

2100
02:33:35,992 --> 02:33:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Not your problem.

2101
02:33:38,544 --> 02:33:40,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 23... Well, I'll say it after.

2102
02:33:40,725 --> 02:33:45,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular freestyle players take the steps for a song and work them into a dance routine.

2103
02:33:45,528 --> 02:33:48,930
[SPEAKER_03]: The routine always varies depending on the song and freestyler.

2104
02:33:49,351 --> 02:33:55,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Some amazing feats have taken place in this competition, and their excitement levels rivals that of any extreme sport.

2105
02:33:56,195 --> 02:33:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice use of the word extreme.

2106
02:34:00,750 --> 02:34:11,398
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 Freestyle, also known as Old School Freestyle, is a demonstration of freestyling techniques from several years back.

2107
02:34:11,859 --> 02:34:21,466
[SPEAKER_03]: These routines utilize the safety bars at the back of the arcade machine and incorporate moves such as hand plants, hitting an arrow with hands instead of feet, and knee drops, landing on an arrow with knees.

2108
02:34:21,806 --> 02:34:23,928
[SPEAKER_03]: These often cause great pain to the performer.

2109
02:34:24,869 --> 02:34:25,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Performer.

2110
02:34:26,931 --> 02:34:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, A-Team routines are generally considered childish and not cool anymore.

2111
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:36,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I think that A-Team routines have the biggest wow factor, but many don't share my opinion.

2112
02:34:37,873 --> 02:34:40,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we're done with the background, let's get into the real meat of this.

2113
02:34:41,317 --> 02:34:44,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, of course, talking about how I fit into this whole picture.

2114
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:49,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Through a little negotiating, green whining, I managed to get into Shaft as an observer.

2115
02:34:49,505 --> 02:34:51,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, or so I thought.

2116
02:34:52,267 --> 02:34:58,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, I participated in the most embarrassing and the most fun activity of my life, competing in freestyles.

2117
02:35:01,946 --> 02:35:03,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, here's the rundown.

2118
02:35:03,767 --> 02:35:10,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Midway through the freestyle competition, Rob and Janie, the MC and tournament organizer, noticed that not enough people had signed up for competition.

2119
02:35:11,173 --> 02:35:17,839
[SPEAKER_03]: They then decided to make an improvisational freestyle category, which was one-third of the normal $15 entry fee.

2120
02:35:18,259 --> 02:35:20,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Having only $10 on me, I decided to go for it.

2121
02:35:21,261 --> 02:35:22,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Here was the catch.

2122
02:35:22,543 --> 02:35:26,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it was improv, the machine was set to roulette mode, which selects a song at random.

2123
02:35:27,319 --> 02:35:30,983
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had been able to pick my own song, things would have been monumentally different.

2124
02:35:31,203 --> 02:35:32,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Monumentally different.

2125
02:35:33,645 --> 02:35:35,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Momentally, monumentally different.

2126
02:35:36,068 --> 02:35:36,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, big words.

2127
02:35:37,469 --> 02:35:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Namely, I probably would have had a routine set up, which defeats the purpose of improv.

2128
02:35:41,813 --> 02:35:45,857
[SPEAKER_03]: As it was, I embarrassed myself royally, doing rave moves to a bubblegum pop song.

2129
02:35:46,238 --> 02:35:50,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It was entertaining in its incognuity, but it was not a winner.

2130
02:35:52,708 --> 02:35:53,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a winner.

2131
02:35:53,268 --> 02:35:54,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Stand by to lose.

2132
02:35:55,890 --> 02:35:57,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand by to lose.

2133
02:35:57,291 --> 02:35:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.

2134
02:35:58,692 --> 02:36:03,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the wild part of my experience was not in my improv entry, but in what happened while waiting.

2135
02:36:03,516 --> 02:36:04,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It was chaos incarnate.

2136
02:36:05,017 --> 02:36:09,340
[SPEAKER_03]: My good friend Justin was going crazy with the deep fryer, dropping in everything he thought he could get away with.

2137
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:13,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I still remember stuffing my face with deep fried Twinkies and candy corn.

2138
02:36:13,082 --> 02:36:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun, albeit messy.

2139
02:36:16,024 --> 02:36:21,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Much of the time I was in the party room slash broadcast booth, talking with my friends and helping out with the Orange Lounge radio broadcast.

2140
02:36:21,726 --> 02:36:22,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

2141
02:36:23,127 --> 02:36:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The broadcast was full of inside jokes, all of which were too rude and obscure to mention.

2142
02:36:27,729 --> 02:36:32,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember Justin taking over the airwaves, telling me to stop hitting him, although I was doing no such thing.

2143
02:36:32,971 --> 02:36:34,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still moderately funny.

2144
02:36:35,952 --> 02:36:36,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2145
02:36:36,332 --> 02:36:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a live journal post.

2146
02:36:38,073 --> 02:36:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, this totally sounds like a live journal post.

2147
02:36:41,034 --> 02:36:41,834
[SPEAKER_16]: It's quite amusing.

2148
02:36:42,355 --> 02:36:42,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Please continue.

2149
02:36:44,508 --> 02:36:45,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a loser!

2150
02:36:45,429 --> 02:36:45,849
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

2151
02:36:46,209 --> 02:36:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: A few times I came out of the party room to watch the freestylers work their magic on the stage.

2152
02:36:50,632 --> 02:36:53,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It is from one of the routines that my story gets its name.

2153
02:36:53,674 --> 02:36:59,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Wendell, a popular freestyler, was doing a comedy routine to Orion 7-8, one of the more annoying songs.

2154
02:37:00,097 --> 02:37:04,060
[SPEAKER_03]: One of his friends was holding up a hot roast beef sandwich, playing keep away with poor Wendell.

2155
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:08,082
[SPEAKER_03]: At certain points in the song, the crowd, spoofing the song lyrics, chanted, Roast beef!

2156
02:37:08,582 --> 02:37:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Roast beef!

2157
02:37:09,323 --> 02:37:09,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot!

2158
02:37:09,823 --> 02:37:10,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot!

2159
02:37:10,284 --> 02:37:10,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot!

2160
02:37:11,244 --> 02:37:11,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

2161
02:37:12,405 --> 02:37:22,412
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole routine had me literally on the floor laughing, especially at the end, where Wendell finally snatched the sandwich, took a bite, then backhanded his buddy, who was sneaking up behind him.

2162
02:37:22,432 --> 02:37:23,473
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Holland, wasn't it?

2163
02:37:24,273 --> 02:37:24,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

2164
02:37:25,658 --> 02:37:26,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Applause.

2165
02:37:26,498 --> 02:37:30,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, always the charmer, stood on stage and declared, I love stories with happy endings, don't you?

2166
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:40,782
[SPEAKER_03]: More applause accompanied by laughter and wolf whistles, a few of which I must admit were mine.

2167
02:37:42,042 --> 02:37:43,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, that was a beautiful paper.

2168
02:37:43,742 --> 02:37:44,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing that with us.

2169
02:37:44,823 --> 02:37:45,603
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the end, right?

2170
02:37:46,203 --> 02:37:48,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, I did it again.

2171
02:37:49,044 --> 02:37:49,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I closed the window.

2172
02:37:50,764 --> 02:37:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'm assuming that was the end of the paper.

2173
02:37:52,665 --> 02:37:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is.

2174
02:37:54,605 --> 02:37:55,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that was the end of the paper.

2175
02:37:57,188 --> 02:37:58,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well written.

2176
02:37:58,169 --> 02:37:59,370
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys think he did on that?

2177
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:00,091
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of grade?

2178
02:38:00,191 --> 02:38:01,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It was out of 36 points, I'll tell you that.

2179
02:38:02,033 --> 02:38:02,954
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think he got?

2180
02:38:03,295 --> 02:38:03,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I give it 34.

2181
02:38:04,676 --> 02:38:03,916
34.

2182
02:38:04,837 --> 02:38:06,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of 36 points.

2183
02:38:07,079 --> 02:38:07,680
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you give it, Loki?

2184
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:08,721
[SPEAKER_16]: It was grammatically correct.

2185
02:38:09,021 --> 02:38:11,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2186
02:38:11,704 --> 02:38:12,345
[SPEAKER_05]: What grade is he in?

2187
02:38:13,847 --> 02:38:14,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2188
02:38:14,527 --> 02:38:15,048
[SPEAKER_03]: In high school.

2189
02:38:18,584 --> 02:38:20,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's freshman or sophomore.

2190
02:38:20,526 --> 02:38:22,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a guess.

2191
02:38:22,848 --> 02:38:23,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it was alright.

2192
02:38:23,769 --> 02:38:27,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It started going off topic towards the end.

2193
02:38:27,552 --> 02:38:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: You were explaining the different categories in DDR and then all of a sudden it's all something else.

2194
02:38:35,799 --> 02:38:36,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2195
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:41,898
[SPEAKER_23]: It sounds a lot like my senior project.

2196
02:38:43,138 --> 02:38:43,358
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

2197
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:50,022
[SPEAKER_23]: See, what happens, I think what happens is you procrastinate and you wait until the last minute to write your paper and it ends up coming out like this.

2198
02:38:51,343 --> 02:38:52,123
[SPEAKER_23]: So what do you think, Rob?

2199
02:38:52,904 --> 02:38:53,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got to give me grades.

2200
02:38:53,984 --> 02:38:54,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Grades?

2201
02:38:54,204 --> 02:38:54,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, Matt.

2202
02:38:54,625 --> 02:38:56,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you get out of 36 points?

2203
02:39:02,645 --> 02:39:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: 34.0596 All right, very nice.

2204
02:39:04,725 --> 02:39:08,146
[SPEAKER_23]: For grammatical correctness, yes, I guess I'll give it... Oh, my bad.

2205
02:39:08,646 --> 02:39:09,326
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a senior.

2206
02:39:09,426 --> 02:39:09,826
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2207
02:39:10,026 --> 02:39:10,966
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a senior in high school.

2208
02:39:11,606 --> 02:39:12,006
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2209
02:39:12,106 --> 02:39:12,746
[SPEAKER_23]: He's getting pissed.

2210
02:39:13,107 --> 02:39:16,847
[SPEAKER_23]: In that case, F. In that case, F. You should know better.

2211
02:39:16,947 --> 02:39:21,108
[SPEAKER_23]: There's not much difference between freshmen and seniors when it comes to, like, curriculum when I was in high school.

2212
02:39:22,468 --> 02:39:23,108
[SPEAKER_23]: Your grade, Brad?

2213
02:39:24,028 --> 02:39:24,269
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd say 31.

2214
02:39:24,309 --> 02:39:24,269
31?

2215
02:39:24,329 --> 02:39:25,509
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, you give him a B.

2216
02:39:28,869 --> 02:39:29,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I give him 59.

2217
02:39:29,829 --> 02:39:31,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I give him 59 points for that.

2218
02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:32,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautiful.

2219
02:39:32,370 --> 02:39:34,191
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no 59, you fuckhead.

2220
02:39:35,011 --> 02:39:35,971
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but this is what's funny.

2221
02:39:36,271 --> 02:39:37,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how many points he did get?

2222
02:39:38,372 --> 02:39:37,492
33.

2223
02:39:38,452 --> 02:39:39,773
[SPEAKER_03]: He got 33 points.

2224
02:39:40,333 --> 02:39:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Minus 3 points for missing the Sakpamani thing, just like we said.

2225
02:39:45,635 --> 02:39:46,195
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

2226
02:39:47,796 --> 02:39:50,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I only learned two things in high school.

2227
02:39:50,357 --> 02:39:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2228
02:39:51,037 --> 02:39:53,878
[SPEAKER_16]: How to avoid people, and then a mole of 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

2229
02:39:57,461 --> 02:40:00,265
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm doing the way over my head thing right now where I put my hand in.

2230
02:40:00,686 --> 02:40:01,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I took AP Chemistry.

2231
02:40:05,232 --> 02:40:09,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Beanie gave that paper a double S. That was winner.

2232
02:40:09,738 --> 02:40:10,279
[SPEAKER_16]: That's winner.

2233
02:40:10,519 --> 02:40:12,021
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm five rating.

2234
02:40:14,522 --> 02:40:15,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob's vibrating.

2235
02:40:15,323 --> 02:40:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's vibrating, but it's a restricted vibrate, so I don't answer restricted numbers.

2236
02:40:18,866 --> 02:40:19,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2237
02:40:20,667 --> 02:40:21,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, wow.

2238
02:40:22,048 --> 02:40:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We've still got about a good 15 minutes to fill in the show.

2239
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:25,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fill it up with a ferret.

2240
02:40:25,731 --> 02:40:26,652
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no ferret filling.

2241
02:40:28,333 --> 02:40:29,194
[SPEAKER_11]: What else can we talk about?

2242
02:40:29,795 --> 02:40:30,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Brad, do you want to rant about something?

2243
02:40:30,996 --> 02:40:31,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, fucking guy.

2244
02:40:33,778 --> 02:40:34,559
[SPEAKER_23]: This is for Paul.

2245
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:38,862
[SPEAKER_23]: Your daughter, she come to my house, and she kick my dog.

2246
02:40:38,882 --> 02:40:41,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to tell a joke.

2247
02:40:41,264 --> 02:40:41,845
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to tell a joke.

2248
02:40:42,245 --> 02:40:42,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2249
02:40:42,665 --> 02:40:43,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I need joke music.

2250
02:40:46,261 --> 02:40:47,602
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys all bidded over.

2251
02:40:48,083 --> 02:40:50,145
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys all bidded over on the thing.

2252
02:40:50,185 --> 02:40:51,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, I'm talking to you.

2253
02:40:51,586 --> 02:40:54,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Play me something from Keyboard Mania.

2254
02:40:54,249 --> 02:40:54,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Something happy.

2255
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:56,251
[SPEAKER_23]: No keyboard for you.

2256
02:40:58,834 --> 02:41:00,616
[SPEAKER_23]: A monkey for coffee in my boots.

2257
02:41:03,894 --> 02:41:05,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that kind of fits.

2258
02:41:05,416 --> 02:41:10,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, a guy was walking in the woods, and he was lost and lost and lost for days.

2259
02:41:11,323 --> 02:41:22,417
[SPEAKER_16]: So he chances upon this house, and he notices that there are telephone wires coming out of the house, so he knocks on the door, and this ancient old man answers the phone, answers the phone, answers the door.

2260
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:25,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Please sir, please, can I use your telephone?

2261
02:41:25,683 --> 02:41:26,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm lost in the woods.

2262
02:41:26,966 --> 02:41:31,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Guy goes, sure, you can use my telephone and you can stay at my house too until someone can come get you.

2263
02:41:32,336 --> 02:41:34,560
[SPEAKER_16]: But my one rule is that you cannot sleep with my daughter.

2264
02:41:35,485 --> 02:41:46,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so he goes in the house, uses the telephone, has dinner with the family, and, well, the guy's daughter was really hot, and he couldn't help it, she just went mad, and placed it at the end of the table.

2265
02:41:47,087 --> 02:41:53,149
[SPEAKER_16]: So, late at night, the guy sneaks out of his room, and goes and, you know, has his way with her, and goes to bed.

2266
02:41:53,809 --> 02:41:58,930
[SPEAKER_16]: He wakes up in the morning with a gigantic rock on his chest, and there's a note attached to it.

2267
02:41:59,770 --> 02:42:02,951
[SPEAKER_16]: First greatest of all tortures, a gigantic rock stuck on your chest.

2268
02:42:03,311 --> 02:42:04,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And he goes, well, shit, you

2269
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:05,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Ouch.

2270
02:42:26,832 --> 02:42:27,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that a nice joke?

2271
02:42:27,592 --> 02:42:27,952
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

2272
02:42:28,152 --> 02:42:32,813
[SPEAKER_23]: Being a girl, I don't think you can completely appreciate the pain that I just felt right there.

2273
02:42:32,833 --> 02:42:34,774
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you think, Matt?

2274
02:42:35,194 --> 02:42:35,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

2275
02:42:35,954 --> 02:42:38,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that one like, fifth grade.

2276
02:42:38,514 --> 02:42:39,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fuck you then.

2277
02:42:41,655 --> 02:42:42,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any... I have another one.

2278
02:42:42,995 --> 02:42:43,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Another joke?

2279
02:42:43,875 --> 02:42:44,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

2280
02:42:46,296 --> 02:42:47,456
[SPEAKER_16]: This guy was in jail.

2281
02:42:48,916 --> 02:42:51,277
[SPEAKER_16]: He had been in jail for so long and hadn't gotten laid.

2282
02:42:51,637 --> 02:42:52,837
[SPEAKER_16]: He hadn't even been anyone's bitch.

2283
02:42:53,741 --> 02:42:57,883
[SPEAKER_16]: So he gets out of jail, and they give him his suit of clothing and 20 bucks.

2284
02:42:58,343 --> 02:43:01,124
[SPEAKER_16]: First thing he wants to do is get laid.

2285
02:43:01,685 --> 02:43:02,685
[SPEAKER_16]: So he goes to a brothel.

2286
02:43:04,406 --> 02:43:09,628
[SPEAKER_16]: And he talks to the madam there, and she's like, well, our women are at least 120 and up.

2287
02:43:09,828 --> 02:43:13,550
[SPEAKER_16]: He's like, do you have anyone that I can get for 20 bucks?

2288
02:43:13,570 --> 02:43:15,431
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like, well, we can give you to Bertha.

2289
02:43:16,171 --> 02:43:18,452
[SPEAKER_16]: So he goes to Bertha, and Bertha's this woman with one leg.

2290
02:43:18,532 --> 02:43:19,452
[SPEAKER_16]: She has a peg leg.

2291
02:43:20,053 --> 02:43:22,734
[SPEAKER_16]: She's missing one arm, and she's got a glass eye.

2292
02:43:23,676 --> 02:43:28,300
[SPEAKER_16]: So the guy is trying his hardest and he just can't get anything with Bertha.

2293
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:30,482
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like, look, why don't we do this?

2294
02:43:30,522 --> 02:43:33,204
[SPEAKER_16]: So she takes out her glass eye and says, try this one.

2295
02:43:34,125 --> 02:43:36,767
[SPEAKER_16]: So he goes at her eye, her eye socket.

2296
02:43:37,248 --> 02:43:39,770
[SPEAKER_16]: It has been the best play he ever had in his life.

2297
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:44,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Then he tells her, next time I need to get something, I'm coming to you.

2298
02:43:44,394 --> 02:43:46,215
[SPEAKER_16]: You were the best ever.

2299
02:43:46,475 --> 02:43:48,357
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like, okay, honey, I'll keep an eye out for you.

2300
02:43:48,377 --> 02:43:49,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2301
02:43:52,779 --> 02:43:53,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha ha ha.

2302
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dear good lord.

2303
02:43:55,560 --> 02:44:00,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, on that note, I think we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

2304
02:44:00,883 --> 02:44:01,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound good to you guys?

2305
02:44:02,764 --> 02:44:02,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

2306
02:44:03,484 --> 02:44:04,525
[SPEAKER_16]: We can wrap it up in ribbons and bows.

2307
02:44:04,585 --> 02:44:05,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want booty music?

2308
02:44:05,285 --> 02:44:05,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2309
02:44:05,625 --> 02:44:07,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have this request though, so I've got to play this first.

2310
02:44:07,866 --> 02:44:09,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to play this and then we'll do something booty.

2311
02:44:09,607 --> 02:44:10,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2312
02:44:10,447 --> 02:44:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.

2313
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a long way to go, honey.

2314
02:44:18,998 --> 02:44:21,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I'm afraid.

2315
02:44:21,424 --> 02:44:22,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are we going?

2316
02:44:23,972 --> 02:44:26,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Into the Dark Black Forest.

2317
02:45:42,031 --> 02:45:44,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Into the Dark Black Forest

2318
02:45:49,913 --> 02:45:53,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody, it's Mr. Spanky.

2319
02:45:54,656 --> 02:45:57,837
[SPEAKER_04]: As promised, I'm here on the air to give you some tips.

2320
02:45:58,678 --> 02:46:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, I'm going to read you a letter, because I don't know much about it.

2321
02:46:02,359 --> 02:46:05,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do know a thing or two about it, I have to admit, you guys.

2322
02:46:05,361 --> 02:46:06,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

2323
02:46:06,922 --> 02:46:10,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But today, we're going to be talking about fellatio tips.

2324
02:46:11,124 --> 02:46:13,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to read a letter for you guys.

2325
02:46:13,285 --> 02:46:15,226
[SPEAKER_16]: You might need a translation of that, Mr. Spanky.

2326
02:46:15,996 --> 02:46:16,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2327
02:46:16,757 --> 02:46:17,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fellatio.

2328
02:46:17,699 --> 02:46:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a blowjob.

2329
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:19,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2330
02:46:20,042 --> 02:46:21,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Fellatio means a blowjob.

2331
02:46:22,626 --> 02:46:23,006
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2332
02:46:24,428 --> 02:46:27,032
[SPEAKER_04]: This letter comes to us from a girl named Emmy.

2333
02:46:28,613 --> 02:46:35,555
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, My husband and I have been married 10 years, and during this time, my enjoyment for giving head has increased tremendously.

2334
02:46:36,055 --> 02:46:39,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I have found the more I turn him on, the more it turns me off.

2335
02:46:40,016 --> 02:46:41,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the more it turns me on.

2336
02:46:41,217 --> 02:46:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't read today.

2337
02:46:42,777 --> 02:46:49,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I start off by teasing him a little, licking the head with my tongue, and licking the underside slowly from bottom to top.

2338
02:46:50,299 --> 02:46:53,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I have also learned he likes me to seductively look at him while I'm doing this.

2339
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:55,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It adds to the teasing.

2340
02:46:56,201 --> 02:47:03,350
[SPEAKER_04]: One problem I had was taking his cock all the way, because I enjoy giving pleasure to him so much I wanted to be able to deep throat.

2341
02:47:03,911 --> 02:47:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do it once in a while, but most of the time I would gag.

2342
02:47:08,564 --> 02:47:12,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that if I could just numb my throat somehow, I would stop gagging.

2343
02:47:13,245 --> 02:47:14,365
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I figured it out.

2344
02:47:14,705 --> 02:47:18,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought some chloroceptive throat spray and put it in my nightstand.

2345
02:47:18,806 --> 02:47:22,967
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time I gave him head, I had no problem swallowing his entire cock.

2346
02:47:24,067 --> 02:47:27,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you how turned on he was, and how turned on I was.

2347
02:47:28,008 --> 02:47:33,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also use children's teething cream, but it doesn't have a pleasant taste and it's harder to apply.

2348
02:47:34,409 --> 02:47:35,230
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my tip.

2349
02:47:35,370 --> 02:47:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It works great for us.

2350
02:47:36,751 --> 02:47:42,635
[SPEAKER_04]: There is nothing that you can do which more clearly shows your love for him than adoring his cock.

2351
02:47:42,935 --> 02:47:44,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

2352
02:47:45,197 --> 02:47:47,479
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Mr. Spanky's next tip of the week.

2353
02:47:47,899 --> 02:47:49,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys should look for me.

2354
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:50,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in DDRPC.

2355
02:47:50,781 --> 02:47:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a character expansion pack.

2356
02:47:53,183 --> 02:47:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, everybody.

2357
02:47:55,104 --> 02:47:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

2358
02:47:59,299 --> 02:47:59,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Outro Music

2359
02:49:36,578 --> 02:50:00,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Fly, fly, fly with it, back it up one more time Walk, walk, walk with it, stop, walk, stop with it Fly, fly, fly with it, bring them out of jail and break down Throw the ball up, swing that bat, turn your back, everywhere's bad Throw the ball up, swing that bat, turn your back, everywhere's bad Palm Beach, peanut butter, Dane County, jailed Orlando, peanut butter, Tallahassee, jailed

2360
02:50:14,414 --> 02:50:15,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, shit, man.

2361
02:50:15,355 --> 02:50:16,415
[SPEAKER_09]: What time is it, dawg?

2362
02:50:16,475 --> 02:50:17,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what time it is, Raylo!

2363
02:50:18,097 --> 02:50:19,878
[SPEAKER_09]: It's peanut butter jelly time!

2364
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:40,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

2365
02:50:40,052 --> 02:50:41,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2366
02:50:42,825 --> 02:50:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to wrap up tonight's show because we're just about at the end.

2367
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:50,147
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to wrap it up in cellophane.

2368
02:50:50,168 --> 02:50:52,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap it up in a nice little bowl.

2369
02:50:52,468 --> 02:50:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And sell it on eBay.

2370
02:50:53,669 --> 02:50:55,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And give it to somebody for Christmas.

2371
02:50:59,111 --> 02:51:02,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything else you guys want to talk about on the show tonight that we haven't gotten out yet?

2372
02:51:04,212 --> 02:51:04,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Bree South.

2373
02:51:05,113 --> 02:51:06,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I've mentioned it before.

2374
02:51:06,413 --> 02:51:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny show.

2375
02:51:07,573 --> 02:51:08,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love it.

2376
02:51:08,914 --> 02:51:09,274
[SPEAKER_05]: On MTV.

2377
02:51:11,897 --> 02:51:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more rants in you, Jamie?

2378
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you barking?

2379
02:51:17,201 --> 02:51:22,205
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wanting to... I'm feeling restless now.

2380
02:51:22,486 --> 02:51:23,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeling restless?

2381
02:51:23,366 --> 02:51:24,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2382
02:51:24,447 --> 02:51:25,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go out and play some DDR?

2383
02:51:25,828 --> 02:51:27,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm feeling boar, yes.

2384
02:51:27,470 --> 02:51:27,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Boar?

2385
02:51:34,295 --> 02:51:36,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Sunsplash tonight.

2386
02:51:36,076 --> 02:51:37,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be there until close.

2387
02:51:37,618 --> 02:51:38,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

2388
02:51:38,839 --> 02:51:39,860
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come with me, Jamie.

2389
02:51:41,241 --> 02:51:41,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

2390
02:51:42,819 --> 02:51:44,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys going to play?

2391
02:51:44,020 --> 02:51:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everything there is... You know what this town needs?

2392
02:51:48,861 --> 02:51:49,822
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Parapara team.

2393
02:51:51,623 --> 02:51:51,843
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2394
02:51:52,363 --> 02:51:53,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on!

2395
02:51:53,924 --> 02:51:54,904
[SPEAKER_16]: I am no Paralist.

2396
02:51:54,944 --> 02:51:58,165
[SPEAKER_16]: I know maybe six of them and I only do four regularly.

2397
02:51:58,185 --> 02:51:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what pisses me off?

2398
02:51:59,826 --> 02:52:02,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure... No, this isn't just specific to Roseville Golf Land.

2399
02:52:03,087 --> 02:52:04,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I know most golf lands have this problem.

2400
02:52:05,008 --> 02:52:06,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids that tease people playing Parapara...

2401
02:52:07,569 --> 02:52:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fucking... I had one of them kicked out.

2402
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:11,030
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I fucking hate those kids.

2403
02:52:11,090 --> 02:52:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate kids that think they're better than everybody else.

2404
02:52:13,791 --> 02:52:14,631
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit pisses me off.

2405
02:52:14,651 --> 02:52:14,931
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2406
02:52:14,971 --> 02:52:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, at least we can memorize something.

2407
02:52:18,172 --> 02:52:24,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You can memorize maybe, like, what beer tastes good or whatever, but it's just like, God, kids who think they're better than everybody else just really piss me off.

2408
02:52:24,934 --> 02:52:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to kick so much ass.

2409
02:52:26,435 --> 02:52:27,435
[SPEAKER_16]: You've seen me go off on them.

2410
02:52:27,475 --> 02:52:30,256
[SPEAKER_16]: I had one of them kicked out, and the other one I said, okay, I'll pay for you to play.

2411
02:52:30,296 --> 02:52:30,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it.

2412
02:52:30,916 --> 02:52:31,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Dance.

2413
02:52:31,156 --> 02:52:31,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Now.

2414
02:52:31,616 --> 02:52:32,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

2415
02:52:32,537 --> 02:52:35,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the one that, uh, we had that on DDR once, too.

2416
02:52:35,418 --> 02:52:35,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

2417
02:52:35,798 --> 02:52:36,338
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

2418
02:52:36,378 --> 02:52:36,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

2419
02:52:38,606 --> 02:52:39,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm just looking.

2420
02:52:41,128 --> 02:52:44,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, Orange Beanie, I'm not picking you up because you're in the other direction.

2421
02:52:44,470 --> 02:52:44,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2422
02:52:46,431 --> 02:52:47,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, I'm sorry.

2423
02:52:47,092 --> 02:52:51,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh, oh, and don't forget Initial D. Oh, Initial D is cool.

2424
02:52:51,395 --> 02:52:57,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Initial D. But yeah, kids piss me off, and there's a lot of them at Golf Land, and they're all rich and snobby, and they think they're better than everyone else.

2425
02:52:57,559 --> 02:52:57,879
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck.

2426
02:52:57,899 --> 02:52:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They piss me off, they suck.

2427
02:52:58,799 --> 02:52:59,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And they suck.

2428
02:52:59,500 --> 02:52:59,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck.

2429
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:00,861
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they don't suck.

2430
02:53:01,901 --> 02:53:02,862
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because... They blow.

2431
02:53:05,444 --> 02:53:09,027
[SPEAKER_16]: They can't even, no, no, they don't suck, they don't blow.

2432
02:53:09,568 --> 02:53:11,249
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that they exist is worse enough.

2433
02:53:11,389 --> 02:53:16,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God, I think I actually might have just created a pair of Parasak stars with my statement.

2434
02:53:17,174 --> 02:53:17,675
[SPEAKER_16]: God.

2435
02:53:18,215 --> 02:53:19,897
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad, my bad, sorry guys, my bad.

2436
02:53:19,917 --> 02:53:22,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, for the four that I know, or for six that I know.

2437
02:53:22,699 --> 02:53:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll join for the three that I know.

2438
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:26,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll join just so that we have a big group of people.

2439
02:53:26,182 --> 02:53:27,883
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to teach me Like a Virgin correctly.

2440
02:53:27,943 --> 02:53:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do trick... Okay, I'll teach you how to do Like a Virgin.

2441
02:53:29,644 --> 02:53:31,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll teach you... You can teach me the one you know that I don't.

2442
02:53:31,886 --> 02:53:34,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I do know Ashimatsu, but you know what I need to brush up on?

2443
02:53:34,968 --> 02:53:37,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to brush up on Night of Fire.

2444
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:37,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2445
02:53:38,171 --> 02:53:39,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to remember how to do Eurobeat.

2446
02:53:39,932 --> 02:53:40,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, teach me Eurobeat.

2447
02:53:40,873 --> 02:53:41,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to Eurobeat and then teach me.

2448
02:53:42,994 --> 02:53:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh... I'll get you my, uh, max 300 para-para going here.

2449
02:53:47,418 --> 02:53:48,919
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'll tell you what would be great about a para-team.

2450
02:53:48,939 --> 02:53:50,921
[SPEAKER_16]: The next one that I want to learn, though, is O Sole Mio.

2451
02:53:51,741 --> 02:53:56,864
[SPEAKER_03]: For that one day that I do feel like playing Parapara, what we need to do, we need to trick the assholes.

2452
02:53:57,104 --> 02:54:07,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have everybody on the Parapara team sitting in the little booths, and like one person up on the machine, and then when somebody starts teasing them, just get everybody to get up and surround them and just start glaring, and then like Parapara in their face or something.

2453
02:54:08,009 --> 02:54:08,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone get up there and mirror.

2454
02:54:09,189 --> 02:54:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2455
02:54:09,870 --> 02:54:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone get up there and mirror.

2456
02:54:11,210 --> 02:54:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's so 80s.

2457
02:54:12,251 --> 02:54:13,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick kids in the butt.

2458
02:54:13,872 --> 02:54:15,732
[SPEAKER_23]: How about I just inject them with the AIDS virus?

2459
02:54:18,514 --> 02:54:19,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Try Drano.

2460
02:54:19,234 --> 02:54:20,295
[SPEAKER_16]: It kills them more painfully.

2461
02:54:22,279 --> 02:54:24,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine being injected with something that starts eating at your insides.

2462
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:26,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you just inject somebody with air.

2463
02:54:26,781 --> 02:54:28,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I eat McDonald's too, okay?

2464
02:54:30,483 --> 02:54:31,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

2465
02:54:31,363 --> 02:54:32,344
[SPEAKER_16]: My point stays.

2466
02:54:32,564 --> 02:54:34,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I think that we should just go.

2467
02:54:35,745 --> 02:54:37,146
[SPEAKER_03]: You think we're going to end this show now?

2468
02:54:37,806 --> 02:54:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to end this show now?

2469
02:54:40,087 --> 02:54:41,088
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we have three minutes.

2470
02:54:41,548 --> 02:54:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We have enough time to do final thoughts.

2471
02:54:43,249 --> 02:54:44,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to give your final thoughts?

2472
02:54:44,469 --> 02:54:45,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, what is your final thought of today?

2473
02:54:48,471 --> 02:54:48,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

2474
02:54:50,982 --> 02:54:51,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Brad?

2475
02:54:51,442 --> 02:54:52,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Brad back in here.

2476
02:54:52,283 --> 02:54:53,123
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to do a final thought.

2477
02:54:54,624 --> 02:54:58,526
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought is I need more man porn.

2478
02:54:58,626 --> 02:54:59,466
[SPEAKER_16]: I need man sex.

2479
02:55:00,607 --> 02:55:00,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2480
02:55:01,447 --> 02:55:02,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You need man sex.

2481
02:55:02,508 --> 02:55:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, do you have a final thought for today?

2482
02:55:03,609 --> 02:55:04,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I need man sex.

2483
02:55:07,471 --> 02:55:08,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now.

2484
02:55:08,651 --> 02:55:09,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have that on tape now.

2485
02:55:10,252 --> 02:55:10,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.

2486
02:55:10,772 --> 02:55:12,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm going to play that last week.

2487
02:55:12,453 --> 02:55:13,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2488
02:55:13,814 --> 02:55:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I need man sex.

2489
02:55:15,175 --> 02:55:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in every Sunday night.

2490
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:20,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello to those people listening to us in Japan.

2491
02:55:20,572 --> 02:55:24,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I whored out our station to people listening in Japan that were Orange Lounge fans.

2492
02:55:25,033 --> 02:55:26,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge the group, not the radio.

2493
02:55:26,873 --> 02:55:29,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So, their trick, haha, now we got you.

2494
02:55:29,774 --> 02:55:30,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2495
02:55:30,334 --> 02:55:31,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We got you good.

2496
02:55:32,735 --> 02:55:35,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, well, I don't know, maybe we should...

2497
02:55:36,889 --> 02:55:41,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Offer them something a little bit different than just saying, ha ha, we tricked you.

2498
02:55:41,730 --> 02:55:42,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what?

2499
02:55:42,330 --> 02:55:43,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Say, arigato gozaimasu.

2500
02:55:43,890 --> 02:55:44,330
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that mean?

2501
02:55:44,470 --> 02:55:45,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2502
02:55:45,351 --> 02:55:45,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2503
02:55:45,651 --> 02:55:46,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You should know what that means.

2504
02:55:46,551 --> 02:55:47,131
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

2505
02:55:47,291 --> 02:55:47,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too white.

2506
02:55:48,271 --> 02:55:58,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have those four Orange Lounge songs that we can't, no, I'm not sure if you have them in rotation, the stuff from Poppin' Music, Guitar Freak 2nd, 3rd, and... No, but I'll get them very soon.

2507
02:55:58,593 --> 02:55:59,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, very soon.

2508
02:55:59,053 --> 02:56:01,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Four more Orange Lounge tracks for the rotation.

2509
02:56:01,734 --> 02:56:04,134
[SPEAKER_03]: What do the kids have to look forward to next week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2510
02:56:06,722 --> 02:56:09,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to sacrifice Loki to the gods live on air.

2511
02:56:11,626 --> 02:56:13,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki is a god.

2512
02:56:13,067 --> 02:56:14,508
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the Riddler god, okay?

2513
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:17,350
[SPEAKER_16]: That means you're played by Jim Carrey.

2514
02:56:18,892 --> 02:56:19,953
[SPEAKER_05]: In a bad movie!

2515
02:56:20,573 --> 02:56:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I like Jim Carrey, okay?

2516
02:56:22,134 --> 02:56:22,855
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be an honor.

2517
02:56:23,756 --> 02:56:26,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, then you should, like, watch The Mask at my place on Laserdisc.

2518
02:56:27,219 --> 02:56:28,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I have The Mask on DVD.

2519
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:30,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I have it on Laserdisc, and Laserdiscs are cooler.

2520
02:56:31,682 --> 02:56:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They're big CD coasters.

2521
02:56:34,212 --> 02:56:34,632
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not.

2522
02:56:35,434 --> 02:56:37,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh, oh.

2523
02:56:37,398 --> 02:56:39,763
[SPEAKER_16]: My half.com thing is going to arrive sometime next week.

2524
02:56:39,783 --> 02:56:40,083
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2525
02:56:40,364 --> 02:56:43,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I ordered Sense and Sensibility on widescreen Laserdiscs so I can watch more Alan Rickman.

2526
02:56:44,984 --> 02:56:45,925
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a hopeless case.

2527
02:56:46,745 --> 02:56:55,608
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Jamie's friends page now, it is filled up with the Slytherin community, the Draco community, the Alan Rickman community.

2528
02:56:55,668 --> 02:57:03,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in the Alan Rickman community, the Slytherin community, the Professor Snape community, and I'm in the Animal Crossing community.

2529
02:57:03,971 --> 02:57:05,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Potter Draco boy part.

2530
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:07,692
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I am not.

2531
02:57:08,012 --> 02:57:08,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

2532
02:57:09,273 --> 02:57:10,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I've read some pretty good things.

2533
02:57:11,353 --> 02:57:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I didn't mean to hear that.

2534
02:57:13,712 --> 02:57:15,954
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not into the teeny boy stuff, though.

2535
02:57:16,055 --> 02:57:16,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

2536
02:57:17,056 --> 02:57:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

2537
02:57:17,276 --> 02:57:17,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You're okay.

2538
02:57:17,937 --> 02:57:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still sane, then.

2539
02:57:19,398 --> 02:57:21,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, she still hasn't joined the Animal Crossing group.

2540
02:57:21,460 --> 02:57:21,921
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with that?

2541
02:57:21,941 --> 02:57:22,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

2542
02:57:22,361 --> 02:57:23,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I joined it here at your place.

2543
02:57:23,763 --> 02:57:24,123
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2544
02:57:24,163 --> 02:57:24,443
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2545
02:57:24,483 --> 02:57:24,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2546
02:57:24,984 --> 02:57:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2547
02:57:26,746 --> 02:57:27,847
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for me from Jamie.

2548
02:57:32,685 --> 02:57:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my final thought is, uh, I hate boys!

2549
02:57:36,149 --> 02:57:36,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate boys!

2550
02:57:37,751 --> 02:57:38,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them.

2551
02:57:38,231 --> 02:57:39,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then we'll get you some pussy.

2552
02:57:42,116 --> 02:57:42,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm confused.

2553
02:57:42,977 --> 02:57:43,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuna.

2554
02:57:43,998 --> 02:57:44,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Bull.

2555
02:57:45,199 --> 02:57:46,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all I need is two turntables.

2556
02:57:46,821 --> 02:57:47,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the microphone.

2557
02:57:47,682 --> 02:57:49,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Two turntables and a microphone.

2558
02:57:49,545 --> 02:57:50,886
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get you a fish taco!

2559
02:57:52,308 --> 02:57:57,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie actually had fish tacos the other week, or the other day, and I was laughing at her because she was eating fish tacos.

2560
02:57:57,212 --> 02:57:58,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually won an eBay auction.

2561
02:57:59,013 --> 02:58:02,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a second 5-key controller now for Beatmania, and it's a lot better than the other one.

2562
02:58:02,856 --> 02:58:08,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeah, no, I have the old ASCII pad, I have the, it's the Beatcon, whatever that is.

2563
02:58:09,822 --> 02:58:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's better than the other one.

2564
02:58:11,383 --> 02:58:11,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew, gross.

2565
02:58:11,963 --> 02:58:12,664
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm modding them.

2566
02:58:12,684 --> 02:58:16,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2567
02:58:16,107 --> 02:58:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all like that, they're all like that.

2568
02:58:19,432 --> 02:58:22,335
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one with piano keys, which is somewhat decent.

2569
02:58:22,476 --> 02:58:25,919
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the official ASCII one, which sucks ass.

2570
02:58:27,722 --> 02:58:31,626
[SPEAKER_16]: But I've been hearing that NCSX was dropping their 2DX controllers to $50.

2571
02:58:33,188 --> 02:58:34,810
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm checking that out.

2572
02:58:35,922 --> 02:58:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm doing a mod on mine that actually, I'm making one, I'm making a brand new mod for 5-key.

2573
02:58:41,804 --> 02:58:45,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to actually put ball bearings underneath the turntable to make it spin better.

2574
02:58:46,305 --> 02:58:53,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has room for it, and they have these two really crappy plastic things that it spins on, but there's room for ball bearings inside there, so I'm going to put that on there.

2575
02:58:54,127 --> 02:58:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a glue rubber mat on top of it so that you have grip on the turntable.

2576
02:58:58,188 --> 02:59:01,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the keys and everything is fine, but yeah, just the turntable sucks.

2577
02:59:02,269 --> 02:59:03,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Make me a 2DX controller.

2578
02:59:06,519 --> 02:59:06,639
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2579
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2580
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:08,120
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll pay you.

2581
02:59:09,221 --> 02:59:09,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

2582
02:59:10,522 --> 02:59:10,842
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

2583
02:59:11,162 --> 02:59:11,763
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thought.

2584
02:59:12,243 --> 02:59:14,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Which dysfunctional Sesame Street character are you?

2585
02:59:16,146 --> 02:59:18,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I got Bert and Ernie's gay relationship.

2586
02:59:19,708 --> 02:59:25,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly enough, I got Grover on E. I'm Grouch's heroin addiction.

2587
02:59:27,614 --> 02:59:28,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about you, Brad?

2588
02:59:28,614 --> 02:59:30,536
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't participate in this dorky thing.

2589
02:59:30,556 --> 02:59:32,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're transsexual Elmo.

2590
02:59:33,562 --> 02:59:35,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, I have a thought, actually.

2591
02:59:35,503 --> 02:59:39,666
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought it was kind of weird how... Hey, Jamie, yes I can think.

2592
02:59:40,266 --> 02:59:46,069
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, I thought it was kind of weird how Rob disappeared from our studio when Mr. Spanky came in.

2593
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:47,690
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's amazing.

2594
02:59:47,750 --> 02:59:51,392
[SPEAKER_23]: And why did Mr. Spanky sound like he was related to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog?

2595
02:59:54,254 --> 02:59:55,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they are related.

2596
02:59:55,134 --> 02:59:57,035
[SPEAKER_23]: That sexual tip was good.

2597
02:59:57,135 --> 02:59:59,317
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate you.

2598
02:59:59,557 --> 03:00:00,337
[SPEAKER_05]: He was scaring me, though.

2599
03:00:00,357 --> 03:00:01,378
[SPEAKER_05]: He kept grabbing my ass.

2600
03:00:02,682 --> 03:00:03,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Spanky, that was.

2601
03:00:04,663 --> 03:00:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought he was talking about me.

2602
03:00:05,824 --> 03:00:06,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he doesn't mind when I do it.

2603
03:00:09,387 --> 03:00:10,508
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're running over.

2604
03:00:10,548 --> 03:00:11,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to go.

2605
03:00:11,388 --> 03:00:12,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, you guys.

2606
03:00:12,149 --> 03:00:12,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

2607
03:00:12,609 --> 03:00:13,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're running over the show.

2608
03:00:13,610 --> 03:00:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2609
03:00:17,012 --> 03:00:17,653
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.

2610
03:00:18,053 --> 03:00:18,593
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2611
03:00:18,793 --> 03:00:19,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2612
03:00:19,194 --> 03:00:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2613
03:00:20,339 --> 03:00:23,341
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2614
03:00:23,901 --> 03:00:27,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2615
03:00:27,823 --> 03:00:33,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2616
03:00:33,285 --> 03:00:39,729
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

2617
03:00:40,309 --> 03:00:43,751
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2618
03:00:44,311 --> 03:00:48,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, a buffoon's meeting with the dean of admissions at a prestigious college.

2619
03:00:49,813 --> 03:00:57,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Michael, I'd like to extend my warmest congratulations on your upcoming graduation, and I understand you're interested in matriculating here in the fall.

2620
03:00:58,619 --> 03:01:00,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a snake, man!

2621
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:06,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, pets are welcome here on campus, be it the traditional dog or cat, or even the occasional reptile.

2622
03:01:07,945 --> 03:01:09,866
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I fed it some beer, man!

2623
03:01:10,726 --> 03:01:12,668
[SPEAKER_00]: It was slithering this way and that!

2624
03:01:13,168 --> 03:01:14,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all fucked up!

2625
03:01:15,527 --> 03:01:16,367
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure it was.

2626
03:01:17,008 --> 03:01:20,989
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we discourage inappropriate drinking among both students and pets here on campus.

2627
03:01:22,229 --> 03:01:23,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking shit!

2628
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:27,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's a not uncommon reaction to this policy.

2629
03:01:27,771 --> 03:01:29,712
[SPEAKER_19]: So tell me a little bit more about your background.

2630
03:01:31,052 --> 03:01:33,553
[SPEAKER_00]: My father's a fucking asshole, man!

2631
03:01:33,893 --> 03:01:34,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Hmm, I see.

2632
03:01:35,414 --> 03:01:37,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Your feelings of rebellion are not unusual at your age, son.

2633
03:01:39,635 --> 03:01:41,876
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother's a piece of shit, too!

2634
03:01:42,839 --> 03:01:45,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I hope you can find an outlet for your hostility over the summer.

2635
03:01:45,941 --> 03:01:48,442
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can come to school in the fall relaxed and ready to learn.

2636
03:01:49,542 --> 03:01:52,844
[SPEAKER_00]: My teacher in high school was a stupid bitch, man!

2637
03:01:53,645 --> 03:01:56,086
[SPEAKER_00]: She had her head way up her ass!

2638
03:01:57,166 --> 03:02:01,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the quality of the faculty at a university such as ours far exceeds that of a local public high school.

2639
03:02:03,109 --> 03:02:06,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Your secretary's a real fat bitch, man!

2640
03:02:06,831 --> 03:02:10,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, she's tried many diets over the years with minimal success.

2641
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:13,681
[SPEAKER_00]: I had diarrhea last month.

2642
03:02:14,602 --> 03:02:17,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to shit all fucking day.

2643
03:02:18,064 --> 03:02:18,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-huh.

2644
03:02:18,964 --> 03:02:20,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we all get the occasional stomach bug.

2645
03:02:21,105 --> 03:02:22,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Never a pleasurable experience.

2646
03:02:23,026 --> 03:02:25,448
[SPEAKER_19]: So, have you given any thought to your choice of major?

2647
03:02:27,289 --> 03:02:29,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a big fucking boner right now.

2648
03:02:31,091 --> 03:02:31,491
[SPEAKER_19]: I see.

2649
03:02:32,071 --> 03:02:35,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, sexual arousal is not uncommon during periods of nervous tension.

2650
03:02:35,313 --> 03:02:36,194
[SPEAKER_19]: I do not take offense.

2651
03:02:38,015 --> 03:02:40,116
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I ate my neighbor's shit.

2652
03:02:41,658 --> 03:02:42,558
[SPEAKER_19]: That's understandable.

2653
03:02:43,118 --> 03:02:46,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I enjoyed meeting you, and we'll be sending you our decision by the end of the month.

2654
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:50,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you got really hairy balls.

2655
03:02:51,621 --> 03:02:53,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it's a veritable force down there.

2656
03:02:54,222 --> 03:02:54,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.

2657
03:02:56,403 --> 03:03:00,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
