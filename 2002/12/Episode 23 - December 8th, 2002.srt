1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No! Message for you sir! Attention!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,360
kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No!

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
What I expect for Spanish exposition is kendo.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Hey!

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Hey!

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Hey!

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Hey!

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Hey!

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Hey!

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Hey!

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Hey!

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Hey!

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Hey!

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Hey!

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Hey!

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Hey!

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Hey!

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Hey!

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Hey!

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,720
And find that funny Orange Lounge Radio

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,120
We are live and this is episode number 23 for December the 8th of 2002 but actually

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,840
we're taping the show a day early on December 7th of 2002 because we've all decided to go

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,260
out and get a life this Sunday night Because we can

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,720
Because we can You have to clean

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,680
You get to clean? Joy, joy

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm going to a concert, I'm going to see Cher You're barely even laughing

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
That's like a horse.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Actually, Cindy Lauper's opening, and that's what I really want to see, so...

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Uh, you are tuned into the Bimani scene's most hilarious radio station of all things

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Bimani.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
My name is Rob Robertsby, you might know me as Sky.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,000
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the Happiest Bunny on the

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
Farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,720
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,920
And in that corner, it is our Tech Massa Loki.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,080
And we have with us tonight in the studio, nobody else.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,080
There's nobody else here, because Brad and Irene are out in the front, but they're playing Animal Crossing, because they suck.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Quit hitting people with bugmets and get in here, we're doing a show.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Pit balls, don't forget the pit balls.

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:52,080
We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later. First we're going to take a quick break, we're going to do a bunch of popin' music songs this break, won't that be fun?

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Any other opening thoughts from you kids?

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
I just made a treble clef with the microphone cord.

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,080
That's special, thank you.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Also on tonight's show, the usual talk of nothing, and a new game. We'll be doing a new game tonight. That'll be fun.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:17,080
And I don't know what else. So, enjoy this opening, I have no idea how we're going to go three hours tonight, but we'll make it. We'll manage somehow.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Thank you guys for listening. We're going to do some pop music stuff, and we'll be right back. This is all from Popin' Music 6, so especially the pop music club that wrote us a letter a couple weeks back saying we need to play more pop music.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:36,080
top music. That'll make them happy. Oh, hello Irene!

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,360
How can we get there tonight?

53
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm sorry, I'm being talked to on the phone. I think now is a very good time to go to break.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,800
What do you guys think?

55
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't let your roots bring you down Live in a foundation of a dream

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm so in love with you, whatever you wanna do it, follow with me

57
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,800
You make me feel so proud of you, you're the one I need you my

58
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I don't wish upon a star, this love is for you, let's stay together

59
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't let those calling distance stay, from heaven soon you'll find

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,800
Can you hear it?

61
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,800
And this is all that it is, all that's right

62
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
We can be so lucky

63
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Wow

64
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Don't let your roots bring you down

65
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Live in the foundation of the land

66
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that you are not allowed to play with your

67
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,100
Today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter

68
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
A, and the number 59.

69
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

70
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,240
Hello boys and girls, you're... hello, no, we don't want another song yet, oh that's

71
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,020
what I get for having the thing on repeat, my bad, my bad.

72
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:55,100
But I hope you enjoyed the pre-show that we did tonight of all the Beatmania 6th Mix music.

73
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,620
It was super.

74
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,300
So how are you kids doing tonight?

75
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I'm fine.

76
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,940
Yes, we're extra special on a Saturday tonight for no real good reason.

77
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,100
No, I mean, we're not going to be here tomorrow night, so we had to do the show sometime.

78
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,380
And when we tend to pre-tape the shows at another location, well, that's just too much

79
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
work for me.

80
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,380
This is much easier.

81
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,380
I'd have been stupid on a Saturday night like anywhere, like Golf Land or Scandi, you have

82
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
all these kids around.

83
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,900
Oh my God, it would have been nuts.

84
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
What are you doing? What are you doing?

85
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Why do you have the microphone? What are you doing?

86
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
It's like, go away.

87
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
I hate kids. I really do.

88
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
We should sacrifice them to the Dark Lord.

89
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Jamie's especially evil tonight.

90
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Yeah, I went over to Golf Land the other day to play some games, and there really wasn't anything to play

91
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,900
because 5 key was broken, because Heart Freaks was broken,

92
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,900
This is the sound of me putting my finger down my throat in honor of RVGL.

93
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,020
Yes, but of course those of you out there listening that aren't from this area have

94
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,900
no idea what we're talking about, but it just gets really frustrating when you have all

95
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,860
these bimani games at your local arcade and none of them work.

96
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
None of them.

97
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,100
We should send copies of the show to Steve and say, this is the bad press that we're

98
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
giving you.

99
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Fix it.

100
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,900
He'd probably just ignore it like everything else we've given him.

101
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,860
I'm going to go and prove the laser tag.

102
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,260
Okay, let's see.

103
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,980
First start by making the guns not look like a giant wad of crap wrapped around with electrical

104
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,820
tape a thousand times.

105
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,660
They can improve it by making it a Qsar.

106
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,180
Damn right they could.

107
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,860
I'd play it if it was a Qsar, but it's not so I don't touch it or go near it or even

108
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,860
think about it.

109
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,600
These are kind of like the supreme of laser tag, huh?

110
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
There is no other?

111
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,920
There can be only one?

112
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,360
There is only one because they keep closing the fucking centers down.

113
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I don't know.

114
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,680
There's like one in Concord and that was like the closest one.

115
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,320
Then there's one in San Fran, I think, and then there's some down south.

116
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Pleasanton?

117
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Pleasanton.

118
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Yeah, Pleasanton.

119
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
They've got one.

120
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,060
I haven't been there in a while.

121
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,560
So how was your week?

122
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,460
What did you do this week, Jamie?

123
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,580
I worked.

124
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
And then what?

125
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,580
The only movie I ever saw more than like twice in the theater I saw, well, besides Rocky Horror, because you know, you see that every week.

126
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Um, Moulin Rouge I saw three times, just because that movie was so awesome.

127
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,580
I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles four times.

128
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Yes, indeed.

129
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
That's so old. I need to get that on DVD.

130
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I saw Bill & Ted twice. Well, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. I saw that twice.

131
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Cool.

132
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,580
In the theater. And I saw The Wrath of Khan twice during its original run in the theater.

133
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Wow.

134
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Neat.

135
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,740
burned down smells like burning and how was your week

136
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,700
Logan I work well I guess you could call it working I was on the computer

137
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,540
downloading shit as usual but this time I was downloading please the hell's that

138
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,580
noise I don't know my computer farted just ignore it it was weird I don't

139
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,800
think a truck backing up in there just ignore it it was that weird hum we had

140
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,060
last week coming back for a little bit. Yeah, but anyways. Nobody move! It's the alien implanted

141
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,520
chip in my head that's interfering with the speakers. Maybe. Yeah, but, uh, so I was downloading

142
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,200
PlayStation utilities to attempt to hack a DDR Max 2 disc. This was a short-lived attempt

143
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,840
seen as I... This is the one you yacked about a couple weeks ago about how you're gonna

144
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:13,640
have the ultimate DDR mix, but no, too tough. It wasn't too tough as I know jack about

145
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,120
programming kind of you need to know how to hack something to be able to hack a

146
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,980
DDR max 2 machine but since I don't know how to do that that's obviously not

147
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,060
going to work all I have to say is there's some weird shit in there I mean

148
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,740
the way they do things on the max 2 disk doesn't make any sense and I don't know

149
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,660
why they do it because they have like for instance the banners for the songs

150
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,860
and everything they have them stored in there three times they have the

151
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,520
executable for max 2 stored in there about 19 times and then they have like

152
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,000
a copy of the actual card that it flashes once. I was like, why store all this excess

153
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,240
data? I can't find the backgrounds. I'm not even going to look anymore because I'm just

154
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,560
fed up with it. Tired. Not worth it. The videos, I know where the videos are. I know where

155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,640
the music is. I can't decode it worth shit, so I said forget it. I just don't care.

156
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,720
No illegal mixes from Loki. No, nothing. You know, if it's going to ever come down

157
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
to it, I'll just buy a machine and run my sim on it. It's going to be 100 times easier

158
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,400
to maintain and work and you're just going to just have to buy the giant metal pads and

159
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,400
just do it that way. Because really actually I was looking at it, you would, there is a

160
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,320
limit to how many songs you can put on there because it actually stores a lot of the data

161
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,360
on the flashcard itself and the flashcard is only 32 megs. And I mean I'm sure you could

162
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,760
probably cram more stuff on there but it looked pretty full as it was. I'm thinking, that's

163
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,040
That's why I'm thinking after Xtreme comes out, they're going to do something else the

164
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,800
way they store stuff on there because there's no way that they're going to be able to fit

165
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:54,200
anything else on Xtreme because it's all stuck on a stupid flash card and it's pretty dumb

166
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
because all the graphics are on that stupid flash card.

167
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now and EOSFBB agrees that you should just put a computer

168
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,440
with a SIM inside a DDR cabinet.

169
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,900
If you do want to join our chatroom, by the way, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx,

170
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,100
and then click on Chat, and it tells you how to do it right there.

171
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Of course, since we're taping a day early this week, if you go in there on Sunday night,

172
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,060
well, there's still quite a few people in there listening to this for the first time

173
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,140
on Sunday night, because people are just used to that.

174
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,700
Brad, tell me about your week.

175
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,020
You're over there in the corner.

176
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
What's going on?

177
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
What's up?

178
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,020
What's up, my brother?

179
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
I have a job now.

180
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
You have a job now?

181
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Congratulations.

182
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Yay.

183
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Isn't that fun?

184
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Everybody enjoys that.

185
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Well, but I get money now, so that's always good.

186
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Money's good! What do you spend all your money on?

187
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
Rent, bills...

188
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,020
I saw you digging through the couch for tokens the other day and it was pretty sad.

189
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Fuck you.

190
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
No, I gamble for tokens.

191
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,020
We play poker for tokens.

192
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
What else did you do this week?

193
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
Did you do anything fun?

194
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
See any good movies? Go out and do anything fun?

195
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Go play any DDR?

196
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
the guitar freaks

197
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,380
but the guitar freaks is broken now I hear

198
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,380
yep

199
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
fucking dolphin

200
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,020
no but I just saw harry potter too that was pretty good

201
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
harry potter

202
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,740
I played metroid prime yesterday that's good

203
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,540
nothing really see I have no life you know

204
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,980
I wanted to buy metroid prime today but I'm holding off

205
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,180
you should buy it

206
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,700
well I have a gift card at target that will give me money off so I figure I'll just use

207
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
my gift card

208
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,060
yeah you should that's the that's the next best gamecube game you should get

209
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:37,060
I want games now that I have some money I can go buy games.

210
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:06,460
but cool. Well, OHA is cool, but OHA only has like seven songs on it. So they need to

211
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:17,460
do like a 70 song DDR OHA for GameCube. You and that damn ferret.

212
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,860
I can lend you monkey balls. You can lend me monkey balls?

213
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,620
Yeah. That's okay, I was in here eating nuts. This conversation has turned dreadfully perverted.

214
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
We have no idea what we're going to be talking about tonight.

215
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
So wait, I came in late. I know this is going to be boring for everybody else, but...

216
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,620
That's right.

217
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Did Matt get a... he got the flashcard finally, or what?

218
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
You were looking at the flashcard, or...?

219
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,620
He's basically given up on the sim. He got... he got... he obtained super secret copies of the MAX2 discs.

220
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Oh...

221
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
And was able to look at them, and then thought,

222
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,620
God, this really sucks. This is hard to hack, so fuck it.

223
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,620
Maybe we should enlist a certain person whose name starts with R-I and ends with a C-K.

224
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,620
He's good at programming and coding and you can look at it.

225
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah, I'm serious.

226
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
What do you think, Matt?

227
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Do you think you can give it a try?

228
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
I don't care, whatever.

229
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
He just gave up.

230
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,620
I just don't give a crap anymore.

231
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I mean, I did get something good out of it that I already kind of had.

232
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
I got high-res banners for everything that's in Max 2.

233
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,620
I mean, Max 2 and all the old songs.

234
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,620
So I have super high-res banners now for that, which is kind of cool.

235
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:31,340
And um, I did find out a little bit how Max 2 works, but I really just don't care.

236
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,140
Now, the person that gave me the disc said he had some friends in places that know how

237
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,060
to do this kind of cracking stuff and said he was going to give it to them and let them

238
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
go at it.

239
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,300
But, I mean, I haven't heard of anything I would have to ask him to see if he's going

240
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
to do that.

241
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,800
Because if he did that and they figured it out, then yeah, I could go ahead and do it.

242
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
But, right now, stop it.

243
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Oops.

244
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Stop that. Just now.

245
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,800
God. Anyways, aside from trying to

246
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
get that thing to work, I was watching Taken

247
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
all week long. That would be good. I'm talking into

248
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
this girl's penis.

249
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:45,520
It's just as much of a train wreck as our other pre-taped shows, what can we say?

250
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,360
We just don't have the magic when it's not Sunday.

251
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,320
It's not my fault they didn't do anything to the Bimani community.

252
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,600
Everyone's freaking lazy and shopping instead.

253
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh yeah, out shopping.

254
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
All their fault.

255
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
It's not my fault.

256
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,760
Which by the way is going to tie into our list list topic tonight.

257
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,520
But uh, yeah, stuff did happen, it's just, you know, minor stuff.

258
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,840
What, stupid stuff?

259
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,960
Yeah, stupid stuff.

260
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,280
Some stupid news that doesn't apply to anyone here in the United States.

261
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,640
Euromix too, they finally figured out the speed modifier code because the retards at

262
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,600
you know, Kami of Europe or whatever, decided, hey, you know what, putting in a menu where

263
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,760
you can select options is so not European. Let's just have it where you just do the nice

264
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,640
little arrow combinations on the pad and that way you can get, you know, codes that way.

265
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
So they didn't really tell them what the codes were, you know, for speed modifiers. They

266
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
knew they were there, they just couldn't access them. And finally someone figured out what

267
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,080
it is and now they have like you know 1.5 speed and 2 speed like we have over here which

268
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,080
is retarded stupid Europeans you know what can I say hey now be nice a rogue was just

269
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,240
going to tell you the same thing they figured out that you're only like speed codes today

270
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,240
so almost beat you to it if there wasn't that delay which oh my gosh Jamie has a hole in

271
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,400
her crotch no I think it happened when I got I got snagged when I was getting out of the

272
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
The car. My car.

273
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
They gave it this way. Easy access.

274
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Okay, it's on the front by the zipper, okay?

275
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Not anywhere near low enough.

276
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,400
This means that I gotta go buy new jeans.

277
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
People give me money.

278
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I got a penny.

279
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
So do I. That's it.

280
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,400
What was I taking up a collection for? We were at a party, a small little party last night, and I remember I was taking up a collection for something.

281
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I need the dead baby fund for Tokyo.

282
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
What?

283
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Dead baby fund?

284
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
What?

285
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
You're gross.

286
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Never mind.

287
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Oh my god, you are awful.

288
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,840
That's an inside joke we're going to tell off here.

289
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,320
No, I'm sorry, I'm in a semi-foul mood, which is perfect for radio.

290
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,400
Why is this?

291
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Why are you in a foul mood?

292
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I'm none of anyone's business.

293
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm allowed.

294
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm a chick.

295
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Are you PMSing?

296
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
No.

297
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:18,640
are you pregnant no thank God I got the ferret thrown at me no well I can

298
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,080
understand she's got a hole in her jeans pretty soon to be bigger you know are

299
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,840
Are you building an interocitor in there? No!

300
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,480
I don't know that reference.

301
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,600
I didn't see it.

302
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,280
Are you boys playing nice in there? No! Are you building an interocitor? No!

303
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,840
Uh, let's see. Let's go to the mailbag.

304
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,680
Why don't I do that? Let's open up the mailbag.

305
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm going to play some mohawk next break because the chat room demands it.

306
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,680
And now the ferret will entertain you.

307
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Hold on, I'm going to our mailbag.

308
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Stop looking a DDR freak.

309
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I don't go to that noob site. What are you talking about?

310
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,680
There's a couple FUs in here, we'll do those later. Oh, here's one.

311
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,680
I do have an email to read. What do you know? Let's get the email reading music, shall we?

312
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,760
Hunting for music. Hunting for music! Here, I will read a page out of Harry Potter.

313
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,080
Hunting for music!

314
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,680
I will read a page out of this book.

315
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,180
Oh, are you going to read a page out of Harry Potter? Not really.

316
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Okay, because seeing as how I sat here during the pre-show and read the whole book.

317
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Alright, here we go, here we go.

318
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
We've got an email.

319
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:00,180
And it's from the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP network.

320
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Word.

321
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,180
And it reads as follows.

322
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Loki should have his own show where he sets fire to the French.

323
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Damn those French.

324
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
They annoy me so with their Frenchness.

325
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Your show rocks. We here at the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP Network are very pleased. We will continue to show support to your show and we'll sacrifice one virgin every week so that we may hear you play Instant Love again. Play Instant Love you must. We demand it or Kung Fu Squirrels will rain upon you. Thank you. The proceeded message was brought to you by the Oh My God Please Make the Horrible Pain Stop Oh God the Horrible Pain Network.

326
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
I think we should give in to their demands.

327
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
That was beautiful.

328
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Well, we just played Instant Love last week, but you know what we should do?

329
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
I don't care. We'll play it again.

330
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
You know what we should do? Why don't we put Instant Love in the normal rotation?

331
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
The music rotation for when we're not here.

332
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Because our show is special.

333
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Are you saying that our music show is not special?

334
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,180
No wonder no one listens to it, because you told them that it's not special.

335
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
Special enough for the Olympics.

336
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Hey!

337
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,180
Our show is special, but Instant Love is special.

338
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Fine, we'll play Instant Love.

339
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
God.

340
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
God damn.

341
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
You guys are such bitches.

342
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,700
bitches. And that's all the email we got.

343
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,540
So that's all I'm reading for you. That's, of course, one more email than we

344
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,660
got last week, so

345
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,740
actually, no it's not. We did get an email last week. But if you want to send us an email, go ahead and send us to

346
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,180
an email to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

347
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,500
Sign up for our LiveJournal community before I hunt you down

348
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,580
and sacrifice your balls to... Because

349
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,260
we like to be nosy and read all your journals. Were you just strangling

350
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,260
The squirrel ferret thing with the mic cord?

351
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,260
No, the squirrel was doing it itself. It was autoerotic asphyxiation.

352
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,760
Oh my! Excuse me, I'm still breathing.

353
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,260
Okay! That's just a nice term. It just rolls off the tongue to say.

354
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,760
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

355
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,260
We're gonna take a really quick break at this point, and we're gonna come back,

356
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,260
and we're gonna play a brand new game. I also like vehicular manslaughter.

357
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
You guys are weird.

358
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,380
Okay, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to play a brand new game.

359
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,260
However, I need two contestants for this game, so we're going to take contestants from the

360
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
chat room.

361
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
We're going to all be the celebrities.

362
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,420
Loki, you get to be a celebrity tonight.

363
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
You don't get to be a contestant.

364
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
You're a celebrity.

365
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Yay.

366
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Does that mean I get a chair?

367
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Okay, so.

368
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
No.

369
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
This is the question.

370
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,800
Okay, the first two people to private message me with the right answer to this question

371
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,700
will get to play our new game, our new secret game.

372
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:40,620
Who was the artist that did the song Young Forever?

373
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,660
Who was the artist that did that song in 4th Mix?

374
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,500
First two people to PM me the answer, get to play.

375
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,100
Alright, so that's it, and we will be right back.

376
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Who PM'd the correct answer?

377
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Huh?

378
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,940
Yeah, you have to PM me the correct answer.

379
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
It's a game show.

380
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Just not an answer.

381
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
Like, you can't PM...

382
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Oh, it was Bob!

383
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
And expect to play.

384
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,380
Yes, you have to PM me the correct answer.

385
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,880
Who was the artist that did Young Forever?

386
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,040
Because a lot of people forget some of the dance

387
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,920
media artists sometimes.

388
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
So I figure that's a good one to ask you guys.

389
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,360
OK, I'm going to take a quick break.

390
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,360
As requested by the chat room, the chat room demands it.

391
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,440
We're going to hear some oh-ha.

392
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,000
We'll be back.

393
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh

394
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:32,000

395
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go

396
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The early bird gets the worm

We will, we will be young forever

398
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We are the ones who make it right We are the people of our time

399

There's a devotion and desire

416
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll kiss you every night

417
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000

And, the fifth celebrity is me! You get me! Uh oh, one of our contestants quit the chat

476
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,180
room. One of our contestants ran away. That's scary. So, we're going to have to take the

477
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:27,980
next person that clocked in, which I don't know now because I closed out on the windows.

478
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,180
Okay, I'm taking, I believe the next person who logged in with the answer was 23rd Magus,

479
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,340
so we're going to take him instead. Sorry rogue, you lose. All right, so now it's the

480
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:48,220
OSBB and 23rd Magus. Okay, so what you guys are going to do, you're going to private message

481
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,820
me your answers. Don't say them in the chat room, you guys. Okay, here we go. The first

482
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:05,060
Next question. Is everybody in the room have a pen? Okay. Here we go. This is the first

483
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:11,900
one. Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very

484
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,060
first time. He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it

485
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:24,060
was really blank. Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution

486
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,700
for the very first time. He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else

487
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:49,860
who played it was really blank. Everybody's thinking. I still need answers

488
00:37:49,860 --> 00:38:06,020
from both contestants. Yo, answer now. Before I poke your eye out with a spoon. Okay. Let's

489
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,180
get a little more thinking time. No, I'm still missing one. He's probably trying to come

490
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:22,180
up with something clever. Okay, he's clocked in. Okay, he had quite a little bit of an

491
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:31,380
answer there. Okay, so let's see what the answers were. Our contestant said, EOSvb says,

492
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,140
Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first

493
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,180
time. He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was

494
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,020
really thin almost to the point where they look like they were strung out on

495
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:52,040
heroin but it was from all the cardio Wow all right 23rd Magus's answer is he

496
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,760

500
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Rice Princess, what was your answer?

501
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Uh, Asian.

502
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Was really Asian? I'm sorry, that doesn't match.

503
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Loki, your answer. Everyone that played the game was really...

504
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Super! Really super!

505
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Sorry, doesn't match.

506
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Brad, your answer. Everyone else who played the game was really...

507
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,400
No, just kidding. I thought my answer was greasy.

508
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,160
It was really greasy!

509
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm sorry. That doesn't match either.

510
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,440
Okay, and my answer was

511
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
he had to play the game because he heard that everyone else who played it was really

512
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,940
gay. I did put gay, actually.

513
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,360
So that means it's all tied up at zero to zero.

514
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,160
They're both losers so far, but that's okay because we've got four more

515
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,400
questions to go.

516
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:11,120

And a crack pipe.

521
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Okay.

522
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, you have to get your own crack pipe.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Okay, so here we go.

524
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Here's the next question.

525
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,920

He did matrix walks, bar hops, caution drops, and he even did cough drops!

538
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480

539
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Haha!

Haha!

541
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,080
That's kind of like, oh, he says ri-co-la.

542
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,320
That's kind of like what happens when you go to the doctor.

543
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Drop him and cough.

544
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,840
23rd Magus says, he did matrix walks, bar hops, caution drops, and he even did dynamite

00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Ooh.

547
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,880
So let's see if either of those are a match.

548
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,520
Jamie, what was your answer?

549
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,400

551
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Alright.

552
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,560
Irene, he did matrix walks, bar hops, caution drops, and he even did...

553
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,200
Uh, seppuku, because he's so not innovative.

554
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,240
Seppuku, no, I'm sorry, ehhh.

555
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,400
That does not match up either.

556
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,660
Loki, what was your answer?

557
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,060

00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,700
Pelvic thrusts, very good answer.

559
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,380
But no, no matches, sorry.

Oh, he did yoga.

563
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,780
Very good, but eh, I'm sorry, that's not a match.

564
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,160

caution drops, and he even did the chicken dance.

566

I'm sorry, no matches.

567
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,520
The score is still tied at zero to zero.

568
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,360

Hello?

665
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Lovable Lucy?

666
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
Yeah, just...

667
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,500
Lovable Lucy, now appearing on stage B. Lovable Lucy, the stage B.

668
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,060
She's also really loose.

669
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,460
No, I'm sorry, that's not a match.

670
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,340
Brad, your answer.

671
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,460
She's short, Asian, cute, has big boobs, and she's also really, really...

672
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
Hairy.

673
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,460
Outrageously so.

674
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,740
Hairy!

675
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,900
She's also hairy.

676
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,760
I said lovable Lucy loves Para Para more than any other game in the land. She's short,

677
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,920
Asian, cute, has big boobs, and she's also really, really a guy.

678
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,160
Which would have matched a couple other people in the chat room, but unfortunately neither

679
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,640
of our contestants guessed that she was a guy.

680
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:03,640
Yeah, I would have almost been a match.

681
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Okay, here we go. This is the last question, guys. Let's total the scores here. EOSVB has

682
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:22,440
zero and 23rd Magus also has zero. If they are unable to get a match on this last one,

683
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,380
we're just going to have to post on the website that they both lost, that they're both losers.

684
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:34,380
I suggest you get this one right. Okay. I'm getting mean now. Let's go back to the first

685
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,380
music. Okay, that's better. It's a better key. Alright. You like this key better? Okay,

686
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:48,380
here's the last question. Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole

687
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:56,540
arcade. But if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank. Bradley

688
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,400
the bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him

689
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:18,860
to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank. Everybody's thinking. I have one contestant

690
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:25,860
in?

691
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,860
Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted

692
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:46,860
them to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank.

693
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,860
Okay.

694
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,020
Here we go.

695
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:58,020
I'm going to start with the OSFBB. Are all the celebrities in? No. No, we still got one thinking. Okay.

696
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,940
The OSFBB specifically stated that he's pulling to get your answer on this one.

697
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,220
He's trying to match you on this one.

698
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,700
He's trying to think. Oh, did you get it?

699
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
You in? Oh, is everybody in?

700
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,700
Loki, you in? Okay, here we go.

701
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Bradley the Bully was the best BeatMania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a...

702
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,700
EOS of Eevee says he'd call you a propel.

703
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,700
What?

704
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,700
Well, he said he was trying to match you.

705
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:39,700
Alright, 23rd Magus says, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a fag.

706
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,700
Heaven forbid.

707
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,700
Alright, Jamie, let's see if V.O. said V.B. got that match he was hoping for.

708
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,700
Bradley the Bully was the best B-Mania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a...

709
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,700
Propel! Wow! No, I'm kidding.

710
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,700
He'd call you a blank.

711
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,700
He'd call you a blank?

712
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,700
Yes. I decided not to answer. He'd call you a blank.

713
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,700
Boo! The audience is booing Jamie, boo!

714
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,700
And I have a smiley face.

715
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
Oh.

716
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,700
Next!

717
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
Alright, next.

718
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Um, he would call him a cab so he'd have a chance to get away before he beats his ass.

719
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,700
Ah, call him a cab! I'm sorry, that doesn't match.

720
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,700
Alright. We have some funny answers from the chat room. Jabberwocky says he'd call you later that night for a date.

721
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,580
or he'd call you a Michael Jackson wannabe with a nose and no baby

722
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,940
and he'd call you a cheese, windmill

723
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,380
Carl Sagan pocket watch, ass blaster

724
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:44,500
What an ass bandit. A pansy ass stupid fuck okay

725
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,140

00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,660

729
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,660

730
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,680

748
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,660

00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,660
okay my answer

750
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,660
bradley the bully was the best beatmania player at the whole arcade

751
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
but if you distracted him to talk about ddr

752
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,660
he'd call you a

753
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:07,660
sacramental

754
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:14,660
no that's more of the chibi mentality

755
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,480
wow this game was a blank

756
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,240
alright so our winner was twenty third magus with a score of zero to one yay

757
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,240
yay congratulations

758
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,900
you know what that means

759
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,020
he gets to play the bonus round

760
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,100
yay

761
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,100
I'm gonna have to give everybody the back of their pants.

762
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:19,100
really, really blank. Everybody have an answer? I'm just waiting for our contestant. OK, here

763
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:26,220
we go. The bonus round. This segment on Orange Lounge according to 23rd Magus was really,

764
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:34,180
really, really random. Good answer, good logical answer. You will probably lose. Alright, Jamie,

765
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,900
this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really random. Random! A match! Very good,

766
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:47,540
very good. Alright, logic prevails. 23 Megas gets a point. That's a hundred dollars of

767
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:53,020
monopoly money. That you're not going to get. That you're not going to get. Okay, this segment

768
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:31,020
balls. I have colitis. And my answer was this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really

769
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:39,660
propel. Some people in the chatroom got it. Oh well. So 23rd Magus won $100 of Monopoly

770
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,900
money. So congratulations. Oh, he's going to get some propel.

771
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:50,300
And I'll beat him with the variant. A surprise. Alright. Congratulations. Thank you, you guys.

772
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,580
We're going to take a quick break and we'll come back to talk about some more Bimani stuff.

773
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:01,940
In the meantime, you demanded it, the chat room demanded it, the studio demanded it,

774
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
by request.

775
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,940
Colic balls?

776
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,940
No, not colic balls.

777
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,940
It's a new hack song, colic.

778
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,940
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

779
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,940
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

780
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,940
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

781
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,940
I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

782
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,940
Listen carefully and try to follow.

783
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,940
The objects will come down from the top.

784
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,940
When it hits the red line, push the button.

785
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,940
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

786
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,940
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

787
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,940
First, hit the white key.

788
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,940
Now, hit the black key.

789
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:56,940
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

790
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,940
Easy, huh?

791
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:04,940
All right, let's go on to the scratch game.

792
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:26,940
All right, let's go on to the Scratch game, when the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

793
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,940
With the fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

794
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,940
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

795
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,940
It's hard, but you can do it!

796
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,940
Okay, effector time!

797
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,940
Here's the stick of the new beatmania!

798
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,940
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

799
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,940
That's the effect on and on switch.

800
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,940
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

801
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,940
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

802
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,940
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

803
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,940
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

804
01:00:37,940 --> 01:01:04,540
All right, Loki, please introduce this next song, because it's kind of weird.

805
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,740
Okay, before I came over today, I found one of the strangest Paranoia remixes ever.

806
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,460
It's the first, probably only, all-Spanish

807
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,560
Latin Paranoia remix. It's Paranoia

808
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,200
Aku Eka, or whatever that means, I don't know.

809
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,200
And there's a DGI for it, too.

810
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,200
...

811
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,200
...

812
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,200
...

813
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,200
...

814
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,200
...

815
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:56,200
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

816
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,200
in its entirety on Sunday night at the normal time, just so people don't get too confused.

817
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,200
But if you're in the chat room wondering why you can't really participate live with the show tonight,

818
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,200
that's why, because we tape today early. We're on Saturday.

819
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:39,200
So, we're back, and don't have a lot to talk about, so this is the point where we usually would let Loki do a Sim update.

820
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,200
So, Loki, what's going on in the Sim world this week?

821
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Not too much. They're wrapping up with the submissions for Turning Mix 3. Those are due next Sunday. That will be, I believe, the 15th, so make sure they have your stuff in by, I would say by 9pm at the latest.

822
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Definitely wait before that though, but try to get your stuff in for Turning Mix 3, and then I believe a week after that, they will be having actual submissions up on the web.

823
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:16,080
to be up for about one whole week. So you want to get them then while you still can.

824
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,200
Aside from that, there's a few other things to know. In DDArmaniaX, they've got in their

825
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:26,240
user submitted files for them. They have a nice little list of every single site that

826
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,400
has DWIs on it. And that's where actually that Paranoia Remix came from because there

827
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:37,600
is a DWI out there for that Paranoia Remix. So check that out and you can always increase

828
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,240
your collection that way. And just do watch that forum. They have some pretty good files

829
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,480
that have come out recently. I just got one for Baby Got Back. You got to love that song.

830
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:53,880
So, definitely keep an eye on that. And also, nothing really new with StepMania. I have

831
01:08:53,880 --> 01:09:00,060
checked their site and it looks like that they are in preparations for starting betas

832
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:36,020
Um, I don't really know what these are. I mean, Reggie looks like he's got his giant

833
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:41,180
dunce hat on and he's holding the dog with a bow. And then there's Sabrina who's in a

834
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,060
bunny costume.

835
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,180
Didn't they figure out, aren't they on their way to hacking the PC characters just about?

836
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:52,980
You were referencing something like on one of the boards that they found a way somehow

837
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,620
to hack the PC characters or you can load them in a program or something?

838
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:03,720
I did look at that. All that you get from looking at the one file they're talking about,

839
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,640
the bin file, I believe, is you just get a nice little shot of their face. That's it.

840
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,080
Sabrina the Teenage Bitch.

841
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:16,880
Yes, so you've got this dog fucker and you've got some vampire bunny. That's what your characters

842
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,480
are this week, dog fucker and vampire bunny.

843
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,280
Nothing compares to Mr. Spanky. Maybe we should have Mr. Spanky back on the show.

844
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,280
show.

845
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,280
Why not?

846
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,600
I think we'll have Mr. Spanky back on the show a little later.

847
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah, so if you're still playing DDRPC, and to be honest I don't know why you would, do

848
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
check those out because really I think DDRPC lost its, I don't know, interest a couple

849
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,640
days after it came out.

850
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,320
Oh, I've played all these songs before.

851
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,120
Yeah, it's like, oh wait, this was fourth mix.

852
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,720
I'll wait until we can hack this and put new songs in.

853
01:10:52,720 --> 01:11:01,220
Um, other things that should be noticed, there was, uh, I guess you could call them preview versions of Bag and Paranoia Survivor on the net.

854
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:08,220
Actually, I should say, really ass copies of, uh, you know, Bag and Paranoia Survivor that were on Bimani style, they were...

855
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,220
Hey, guess what, Loki? I've got them right here. Wanna hear, wanna hear a little bit of Bag?

856
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Oh, yeah, let's hear it.

857
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:18,220
Alright, here's a little bit of bag if you guys haven't heard it yet. Now it's really, really quiet, so bear with us. Here it is.

858
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:41,220
You can kind of hear the bagpipe.

859
01:11:41,220 --> 01:12:08,580
It's Riverdance Yeah, woohoo

860
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,580
What do you think?

861
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,760
I think it's crap.

862
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,420
What it sounds like is it's going to be like Orion 78, except it's going to be with bagpipes.

863
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:21,700
It's pretty much that they have the speed down to 65 for the steps to be really close

864
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,700
together.

865
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,700
It's just going to be Orion.

866
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,700
That's all it is.

867
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:30,060
It's actually the kind of music I listen to when I'm trying to relax and calm down, so

868
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,500
I like it.

869
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:38,220
I have all kinds of CDs like that at home, so it's right up my alley.

870
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,860
okay one here uh... paranoid survivor i don't i don't even think you can really

871
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,460
hear this one ball play a little bit of it all thing that you know i really are

872
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,620
in the video

873
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:58,620
you barely here

874
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:05,020
they really are it so uh... yeah i would get the videos but i i can't play videos

875
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:12,020
over the air, because we get a lot of droppage. So, that was a little bit.

876
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:19,660
From what I gather from the videos, it was a pretty cool sounding song. You can't really

877
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:25,700
listen to it on the videos, because they don't have anyone that can rip it yet, because the

878
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:32,700
Konami stuff is like, no, don't do that. So, yeah, not too much to see there either.

879
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:37,700
Yeah, really been kind of a slow week in the whole Bomani community, just nothing going on.

880
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:44,700
It's just kind of that time of year, there's really not anything to really do between Thanksgiving and Christmas except shop, so there's probably not going to be.

881
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,700
I mean, DER Max USA came out for the holiday season, that was really the last thing.

882
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:55,700
We're probably not going to see anything until the beginning of the new year unless, you know, you've got BeatMania 7th Mix coming out for PlayStation on Christmas Eve.

883
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,700
But that's about the only Bomani release coming up.

884
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:02,100
coming up, and then in the new year we're going to see Max 2 for Japanese PlayStation

885
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:10,600
2, and uh, um, what the hell, 2DX7 style, yes. Probably next year. Probably also Max

886
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,560
2 USA at some point, but I don't know, we have to, I haven't, I don't even know what,

887
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,560
I haven't heard anything as far as how well Max USA actually sold. I think we probably

888
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,760
won't get any numbers until actually after the holidays. We can look into that. I can

889
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:40,760
Cool. Also a couple of pop music games came out. They're working on a pop music best hits. I know that, and I believe 7 just came out, if I'm not mistaken. I could be wrong, but I think 7 just came out for PS2. I know it was the first pop music for PS2 just came out.

890
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,760
But... I don't know too much about that, unfortunately.

891
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,760
Yeah, I did notice that they have, you know, like a DDR, they have the $2,000 metal pads,

892
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,240
which are kind of a rip-off, but they also have, you know, as people are aware of, the

893
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,600
2DX arcade controllers, and they also have a Poppy Music arcade controller, too.

894
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
Yes.

895
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Question from Chat Room.

896
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,520
When is DDR Extreme going to be released?

897
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,120
Ooh, Brad brings back toys for us, yay.

898
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,760
Propel and food and drinks, anyway.

899
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:39,760
When is Xtreme going to be released?

900
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,480
A rumor is it's going to debut at some tournament, but I don't possibly see how that could be

901
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,680
the case because it's a Japanese game, so if it's going to debut anywhere, it's going

902
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,880
to debut somewhere in Japan, and places in America will just get it whenever their distributors

903
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,880
get it.

904
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,520
So I don't think there's any particular way that you can debut a game.

905
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,880
Now that particular arcade might debut their game at the tournament, but you really can't

906
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,720
control the rest of the U.S. that way.

907
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:15,220
I got it. Alright. So that's hopefully answers about Extreme. Well, also right now the betas

908
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:19,460
are only up to like 55 or 60 percent done. It's probably because they don't have many

909
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,660
of the Dance Media tracks in them. They have some, but not many. Yes, I mean, we've still

910
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:29,380
gotten plenty of songs that they have to add and test first, I mean, before that even happens.

911
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:36,380
so it's still a ways away.

912
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:41,000
Okay, Chateroom's been talking a lot about this and I thought maybe we would too. Upcoming tournaments.

913
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,980
There are a few tournaments coming up.

914
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,580
I thought I'd mention a few of them.

915
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:48,800
This Friday, if I'm not mistaken, yes, is this Friday,

916
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,520
is the Miggle Milpitas Golfland Evil Tournament Part 2, the aftermath. Yes, the arcade that

917
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,800
just got Derby's Owner's Club this week.

918
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,120
doing a tournament and that should be a lot of fun it's on a Friday night so

919
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,080
it's kind of like a big giant Friday night party and they're doing the

920
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:11,840
typical perfect attack and freestyle competitions however they're trying some

921
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,360
new things with both of them so there's some new things that they're doing and

922
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,760
if you want to visit their website it's www.monkeysfly.net slash MGLT

923
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,800
please go to that one and perfect attack rules let's see they're gonna announce

924
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,520
the qualifying song that day and they're gonna be doing the brackets a little bit

925
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,320
of a different way freestyle is going to be doing this tower system it's a brand

926
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,560
new way of judging freestyle so that should be interesting they're gonna be

927
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,960
doing some new innovative judging and ranking at that tournament so check it

928
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:51,320
out also coming up we've got the cyber beat tournament that's gonna be

929
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,320
happening I'm sorry the cyber beat nation tournament in LA that's going to

930
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:00,640
be February 14th through the 16th that's a Thursday through a Saturday if I'm not

931
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,880
mistaken orange lounge radio will be covering this tournament for sure

932
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,040
unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to make it to Milpitas on Friday Jamie I

933
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,240
don't think you're gonna be able to go because you got work you got the work

934
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,760
thing Loki you too right we all work unfortunately so we can't get there in

935
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,280
time so we're not gonna be able to cover Milpitas but if anybody any of you fans

936
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,040
out there listening to the show, got yourself a tape recorder and a microphone, go talk

937
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:31,760
to some people for us and send me stuff, that would be fun. CyberBeatNation in LA, February

938
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,760
14th through 16th, huge, huge tournament. They're giving away a Max2 machine in freestyle.

939
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,400
They are giving away a Max2 machine in freestyle. A couple rounds of freestyle they'll be doing.

940
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,240
It might be on a DDR Extreme machine, the competition, if it's out by them. Perfect

941
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,920
Attack, they're going to give away a BeatMania 2DX arcade style controller for the winner

942
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,280
of Perfect Attack. So, I'm sorry, but they're not calling it Perfect Attack. They're calling

943
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:58,680
it Stepping, Stepping Category or Stepping Challenge? Stepping Attack, Step Attack? I

944
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,920
don't know. Sorry, I'm messing it up. I'm running through these very quickly. I don't

945
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,420
really have a lot of time to read into detail in this tournament. But if you want more information

946
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,660
on that tournament, it will be coming to ddrspot.com in the next few days. They're going to take

947
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:16,740
some pre-registration there, so keep an eye on that. Or there is a thread in the DDR Freak

948
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:23,460
DDR Freak Tourney Forum. Early next year in Fremont there's going to be a

949
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:28,220
competition at a pizza joint and that's run by one of our fans DCB. He's a cool guy

950
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:33,380
so I'm sure that's going to be a kick butt tourney. Outside of California, I'm

951
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,900
trying to find some well-responded to threads, there's going to be a tournament

952
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:41,420
on December 21st in Baltimore, the town that doesn't listen to Orange Lounge

953
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:45,780
according to our rankings, but there is going to be a tournament at East Point

954
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,880
a great mall on December 21st in Baltimore, so if you're in that area you should check

955
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,780
it out. December 7th, I know I shouldn't promote that because I don't listen to this show,

956
01:19:53,780 --> 01:20:01,540
but you know, you never know. Springfield has a tournament the other day, so that's

957
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:11,600
already done. We don't have results for that yet, my bad. My bad. There's a dancing stage

958
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,180

977
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,840
it

978
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,700
uh... it's on the other side of the oh i mean it's pushing up crazy haha

979
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,320
somebody just so i did a chat room really huge

980
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,680
jabberwocka abba

981
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,760
that'll be a cool sweetest her what

982
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,520
we should probably place

983
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,240
erotic abba i think that's a damn good idea of the next break we're gonna do a

984
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:58,540
tribute to have other than swedish chicks india r

985
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:03,240
in roanoke park on december twenty first they're gonna be doing a winter charity

986
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,360
Perfect Attack Tournament for a Red Octane 2 mat.

987
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,160
Word.

988
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,920
Yes, bring canned goods.

989
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,920
The charity is for a Red Octane 2 mat.

990
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,160
Buy me a Red Octane 2 mat.

991
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,200
No, it's called the Winter Charity Tournament.

992
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,120
I don't know.

993
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,640
I don't know.

994
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,320
I'm assuming that part of the money goes to buy the mat,

995
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,880
and the other part goes to charity.

996
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,000
That's how it works.

997
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,500
Gasp.

998
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,320
Gosh, you guys.

999
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,120
Well, maybe it's another tournament

1000
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,900
this Red Octane sponsored because Red Octane owns your soul if you play DDR and they sponsor

1001
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,060
every tournament except the ones that are... From what I heard is Red Octane is actually

1002
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:44,060
going to be selling some of their products like their ignition pads and Gamestops now.

1003
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:51,060
Woo! So... Um, I can get confirmation on that, hello? Um, by the way, nothing like that's

1004
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:57,100
been told to me and I'm always told everything that happens for Bemani in relation to Gamestop.

1005
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:04,100
I don't care! I have medal stages! So there! Ha ha!

1006
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,100
So those were some upcoming tournaments. Enjoy.

1007
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,100
I would love to go to the Swedish one.

1008
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,100
I want to go...

1009
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,100
Yeah, I know. Bikini babes. Big boner. Alright.

1010
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:21,100
First of all, playing DDR with no chest support sucks.

1011
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,100
I can say this safely as the resolution.

1012
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,100
Oh, I've always wondered. Let's ask a girl about their boobs.

1013
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:32,020
Jamie, if you were to DDR in the nude, would that really hurt?

1014
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,020
Would you get slapped in the face?

1015
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:36,220
Well, first of all, I haven't, but I have played in my pajamas.

1016
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,180
Just imagine it.

1017
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:46,380
No, imagine having large amounts of your skin pulled away from your flesh and stuffed, and

1018
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:49,620
then imagine jumping up and down like that.

1019
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,620
Ouch!

1020
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,380
Come on, every boy wants to know this.

1021
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,540
What's DDR with boobies like?

1022
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,060
Painful!

1023
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,560
What is the best way to- do you like having your boobs restrained when you play DDR?

1024
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,560
It's like, you want to tie them down?

1025
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,560
Shut up.

1026
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,060
Shush.

1027
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,560
No, I have to do the quote.

1028
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,560
Penfold.

1029
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,560
Shush.

1030
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,060
Anyone who gets that is cool.

1031
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:17,560
What if we reduced ourselves to series?

1032
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,560
I tried, ladies and gentlemen.

1033
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,060
I don't know, does it hurt being able to play DDR naked?

1034
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,060
Do you like your balls pop around or something?

1035
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,060
No.

1036
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,060
No.

1037
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,060
Actually!

1038
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,060
Alright, no.

1039
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:31,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

1040
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:34,980
Yeah, my balls aren't D-sized, though, so I would know, they're not even C or B.

1041
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:43,060
You'd be a ball bra!

1042
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,060
Only a coco-

1043
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,480
Who's got the biggest balls of them all?

1044
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,440
Only a coconut ball bra.

1045
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,560
Yeah.

1046
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,060
So nobody in the studio will admit to playing DR in the new-

1047
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,060
to be an athletic supporter.

1048
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,060
Nobody in the studio is going to admit to playing DDR in the nude.

1049
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,060
Well, I don't play DDR at home.

1050
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,060
That involves pulling out 45-pound stages, setting them on the ground.

1051
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:08,060
Yeah, like I'm going to take the extra time to strip down naked to play DDR in my front room.

1052
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,060
Why the hell did I do that?

1053
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,060
That's stupid.

1054
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,060
Not to mention that that room is actually kind of small.

1055
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,060
You've got furniture in there.

1056
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,060
Yeah, the dogs rain around.

1057
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:25,560
And there's seven on the fucking Chihuahua, I mean, it's not a pretty picture.

1058
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,560
Oh, Brad's back in the room.

1059
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,760
Brad, have you ever played DDR in the nude?

1060
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,360
That's for me to know and you to find out.

1061
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,360
Um, actually, honestly, no, I haven't.

1062
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,680
I've thought about it.

1063
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,760
I thought about doing intercourse while playing DDR, too.

1064
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,760
That would be interesting.

1065
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,440
It's like a couple, it's a whole new meaning to the couple dance.

1066
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,440
Oh, we had somebody in the chatroom admit to doing it at home.

1067
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,440
Bombay plays DDR on the nude at home.

1068
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,440
Okay, I definitely can...

1069
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,440
I believe that, yeah.

1070
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,440
Why am I not surprised?

1071
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,440
Why am I scared?

1072
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
Ow, my freaking ears!

1073
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,440
Is anybody else submitting to playing DDR on the nude? No, nobody else. Okay.

1074
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,440
I played DDR on my pajamas before, though.

1075
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,440
How was that?

1076
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Painful.

1077
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,440
Was it breezy?

1078
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:26,440
Well, seeing as how my pajamas usually consist of, you know, big flannel pants and a tank top, then no, not very.

1079
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,440
Okay.

1080
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,440
Alright, we're going to stop being perverted now.

1081
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,440
It's my old house in the hood.

1082
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,440
Oh, it's your old house in the hood. Your house in the hood was cool.

1083
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,440
Okay.

1084
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:46,440
Uh, oh yes, I need to make the announcement, we're not going to be doing the cage match tonight because last week's song didn't get in until very late in the week

1085
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,960
the week and we have the marathon going on all weekend long so it's not hardly

1086
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,600
getting played at all plus we don't have all of our regular listeners so

1087
01:26:53,600 --> 01:27:04,520
tonight's cage match is postponed well can we put both in the rotation no no we

1088
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:10,440
can't you lose okay so let's see I'm trying to find my Abba covers and I

1089
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,320
I think I only have one, but it's a good one.

1090
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:19,440
So we will play that one, if I can find it.

1091
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,240
However, when we do come back from this break,

1092
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,320
we are going to do the FUs of the week.

1093
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,080
So send those to me over a private message in the channel

1094
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,680
right now.

1095
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,440
Or email them.

Or email them to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1097

We're going to do all of your FUs of the week

1098
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,360
right after this break.

1099
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:20,360
I wasn't jealous before we met Now every woman I see is a potential friend

1100
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:31,360
Another says if it isn't nice You caught me saying that smoking was my only fight

1101
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:48,360
Now it isn't true, now everything is new And all I've learned has all the turns I think of you

1102
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:56,360
Don't go wasting your emotion

1103
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:02,360
Lay all your love on me

1104
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,360
It was like shooting a certain light

1105
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:16,360
A little small time is mine and baby, I'm stuck

1106
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,360
I still don't know what you've done with me

1107
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,360
I've grown up old but you've never felt so easily

1108
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,360
You're the kind of fear

1109
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,360
And I don't have it near

1110
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,360
I'm satisfied, I keep my pride

1111
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:43,360
I beg you dear

1112
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:51,360
Don't come wasting your emotion

1113
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:57,360
Play all your love for me

1114
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:05,360
Don't come sharing your devotion

1115
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:11,360
Lay all your love on me

1116
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:24,360
I've had a few little love affairs

1117
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,360
They didn't last very long

1118
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,360
And they've been pretty scarce

1119
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:41,360
I used to think that there's something but It takes the truth even more incomprehensible

1120
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:48,360
Cause everything is new And everything is new

1121
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:57,360
And all I've learned has overdone What can I do

1122
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:11,360
Don't come wasting your devotion Lay all your love on me

1123
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:19,360
Don't go sharing your devotion

1124
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:25,360
Lay all your love on me

1125
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,360
What in the world is wrong with me?

1126
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,360
Oh, it's time to come back to the sky

1127
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,360
Ah, you have seven days left

1128
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,360
What's left of everything?

1129
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,360
You can't take me away

1130
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:05,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1131
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:30,260
Glance adapts to the lifelong

1132
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,240
Even if it doesn't look right

1133
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,040

We'll go somewhere!

1146
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:41,040
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

1147
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:46,120
That's right, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a special taped edition tonight.

1148
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,120
We are taping on Saturday, but we've got a lot of people, a lot of our regulars are joining

1149
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,920
us here on Saturday night, but if unfortunately you weren't able to listen until Sunday night,

1150
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,920
that's okay too.

1151
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,920
We forgive you.

1152
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,920
We forgive you.

1153
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,820
We're all going out and getting a life this week, so we had to change a few things.

1154
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,480
Now comes that part of the show that's everybody's favorite.

1155
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:07,960
Jamie, please explain the F.U. of the Week, why it was created, what it's here for.

1156
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,000
We're pissed and we're not gonna take it anymore.

1157
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,200
We're not gonna take it.

1158
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,280
No!

1159
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:19,040
That's the song. You know what? That's what my new F.U. song ought to be. I don't give a shit if it has nothing to do

1160
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,000
with Bomani. That's the song I want.

1161
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,760
Okay.

1162
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:29,440
Here we go. Jamie's gonna start it off because she's the most angsty.

1163
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:33,580
So here we go, the FUs of the week.

1164
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:38,600
Okay, the first thing that gets the big fuck you is my computer.

1165
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,220
My hard drive died.

1166
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,080
As in broken.

1167
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,300
As in, it wouldn't even reformat.

1168
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:51,420
My computer wouldn't boot one morning, so as your fam was off work, so he was gonna put the restore dust in and

1169
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:55,620
fix everything and make it happy again, and it didn't make it happy.

1170
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:58,600
It said, C drive is damaged.

1171
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:02,240
So I'm sitting here going, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap all day at work.

1172
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:06,560
Um, basically, as it turned out, I didn't have to buy a new hard drive.

1173
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,900
Although, the good thing that came out of it is that I now have a 120 gigabyte hard drive

1174
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:16,000
with the 8 megabyte cache, so it's pretty cool.

1175
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,680
But still, I lost about 60 gigabytes worth of information

1176
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,640
and some photographs that I can't get replaced because my mom's ex-husband destroyed them.

1177
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,960
Fuck you, Michael.

1178
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,880
Not her current husband Michael, but her ex-husband Michael.

1179
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:35,440
Her current husband's cool. Anyway, that's the best point.

1180
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:41,500
It's just distressing, because I have, like I said, a lot of stuff on there, but I just can't get again.

1181
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:48,500
And the ironic thing is that I was going to be backing everything up today, so... that sucks.

1182
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,060
That's better.

1183
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,300
That's your only...

1184
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,780
That and RO again.

1185
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,860
My grandpa and mine.

1186
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,100
All right.

1187
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:00,660
Dad, there's nobody for me to play Phantasy Star Online with.

1188
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:03,180
As soon as I can, I will. I'm buying that game as soon as it comes out.

1189
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:05,720
Or as soon as I can get it.

1190
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:12,720
All right? Cool. All right, Matt, Matt's turn.

1191
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:17,420
My first idea goes to the creators of TGR Max 2

1192
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,900
and the fact that

1193
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,300
they have to program so complexly that

1194
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:26,300
a simple peon like myself who has no programming knowledge will ever play packet. Why?

1195
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:32,740
why? Why won't you let me mess with this like everyone else does? Anyway, so, yeah, F.U.

1196
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:37,980
does a stupid max 2-disc because it's gonna suck and I can't do anything with him. Um,

1197
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:42,900
F.U. does a sub splash even though I'm going there tonight, um, for having all the games

1198
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:47,980
broken because they don't give a damn, and F.U. the fucking kid was playing Speed Demon

1199
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:52,620
all night on Thursday because I couldn't play Speed Demon because the fucker was taking

1200
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:59,620
it over. Kick his ass. F you that stupid kid who's a speed demon. And aside from that,

1201
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:07,220
you know, not too much stuff I'm mad at, other than stupid people, stupid drivers, people

1202
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:14,220
ask dumb questions, that kind of thing. So, that's all.

1203
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:18,220
Alright, thank you for that angsty little rant.

1204
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:28,220
My FU of the Week goes out to people that you go out on dates with that don't return your phone calls.

1205
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:32,220
How fucked up is that? I hate you.

1206
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:38,220
My other FU of the Week... I don't know if I want to get into it.

1207
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:40,220
I have another pretty long FU to lead.

1208
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:43,220
My other FU of the week goes to immaturity.

1209
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:51,220
And people that try to send cryptic little messages that are really stupid and immature

1210
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:57,220
and try to make things into contests that aren't contests that are much more than contests.

1211
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:02,220
FU to stupid boys.

1212
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:26,980
p0k3smot42o

1213
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:32,280
fucking rat. I don't care what you say. Any song that has a groovy little dance to go

1214
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:36,980
with it. Rules. But those other step songs, yeah, they all suck, I'm sorry.

1215
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:42,920
YOSFVB says, F you to traffic and to people with microwaves creating interference which

1216
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:47,680
disabled my telepathic waves from reaching Jamie to answer Propel. And fuck you to all

1217
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:53,280
those people now trying to use Propel as an adjective. And fuck you to Orange Lounge for

1218
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,280
for what seems to be porn talk prohibition.

1219
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,800
When did we ever stop talking about porn on here?

1220
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,320
In fact, I think we've had an increase in it.

1221
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:04,640
Actually, I've got more I can talk to about that later.

1222
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,680
No, you're banned.

1223
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,720
Orange Beanie says,

1224
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,680
F you to Naoki for getting to spend

1225
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,920
so much time for Polteri.

1226
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,760
Orange Beanie, by the way, actually being a Polteri fan.

1227
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,640
And F you to The Point for making my fifth mixed dreams dead.

1228
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,800
Dead, I tell you.

1229
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:28,300
FU to the point, go to Crestview, they have 5th.

1230
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:32,800
Oh my lord, 23rd Magus says, I have a continued FU to Nori Nori Nori, as usual, a big FU to

1231
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,440
being broke, which eliminates my chances of going to Scandi RVGL until January, cough,

1232
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,600
donate to the United Magus College Fund, and a family sized FU to Nero's interface.

1233
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,960
I accidentally moved a folder while making a CD and produced 5 coasters until I found

1234
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,960
out what happened.

1235
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:45,960
Fuck you ahead.

1236
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,880
Your program sucks, you bitches.

1237
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,120
Go learn English, you fuckers.

1238
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,960
I'm punishing you with those FUs for not agreeing with me in the match game.

1239
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:53,960
Bwah!

1240
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,960
Supper!

1241
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:03,960
Brak2000 says, FU to Captain Jack for not doing a cover of Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

1242
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:07,800
I agree, I agree.

1243
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,800
Dang!

1244
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:13,440
Lots of FUs from Stresa, FU'd who his ex, she dumped me the day after my 20th birthday,

1245
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:18,080
but we're still so hung up on each other and she's killing me, but I'll survive, and I'd

1246
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,080
I'd also like to throw an F.U. at my parents.

1247
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:26,080
They've been plotting against me to kick out since June, and I'd like to shove a horse-sized F.U. in my mommy's booty.

1248
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,080
Why does my mom deserve a horse-sized F.U., especially in the booty?

1249
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:34,080
For finding ways to throw my flaws back at my face for childish reasons. Oh my.

1250
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:40,080
Too bad Sally Jessy's not still around, because that would sound like something you need to go talk to Sally Jessy about.

1251
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:45,080
Maybe you could go to Dr. Phil.

1252
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:49,240
twen says at you within thirty minutes i found out the girl i love the got into a

1253
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:53,960
major car accident and is engaged and has a two-year-old in a six months on

1254
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:55,320
well that's

1255
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,880
what happened to the lesbian

1256
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,400
i'm sorry to hear about

1257
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,800
the car accident that's that's a bummer

1258
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,200
well i would say

1259
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,400
if you did that

1260
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:09,320
if it was a lesbian and i'd say it's karma coming back to play

1261
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:12,080
no it's not

1262
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,080
Let's check the old mailbag.

1263
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:20,080
Some people sent in their FUs because they knew we wouldn't be on on Sunday.

1264
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:24,080
Vidpower says, for the third week in a row, my main FU still goes to germs.

1265
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,080
My cough has gotten worse this week and my throat is sore because of it. Also, FU to reading

1266
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:32,080
boring schoolbooks and FU to the dark environments in Metroid Prime. I literally can't

1267
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:36,080
see a Waldus a few inches away from my face, but a very fun game nonetheless.

1268
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:40,080
You know what that cough is? It's the Ebola. You're gonna die. Bye.

1269
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,080
F-E-B-O-L-A

Oh, I'm sorry. You were talking about pornography.

1293
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:20,540
Okay. All the entries are due by Sunday, December 22nd at midnight.

1294
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:22,540
And where must they submit them?

1295
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:28,980
They must send them to my email or give them to me in person.

1296
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:33,700
They can be in any format as long as there's some way I can see the step file or step chart

1297
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,820
or have an edit file for it.

1298
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:41,820
That's all I really need.

1299
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:45,220
nightmare underscore

1300
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,260
so it's nightmare hunter

1301
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,820
yahoo dot com

1302
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:53,100
uh... make sure you put the nice little underscore there between nightmare and hunter

1303
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,820
and uh...

1304
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,660
other than that you know

1305
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:01,120
if you're local you know give it to me in person and all entries will be judged

1306
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,900
on uh... january the fifth

1307
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,900
that's a sunday

1308
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:08,680
and they're gonna be announced on right here on orange island radio the winners right yes cool

1309
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:12,600
And I have quite a bit of porn to grant, so there might actually be for a second.

1310
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,920
Now very briefly, for those new to the show, what is Make Edit Get Porn?

1311
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,120
Well, I've held many edit contests before.

1312
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,920
I decided to do one that's a little different, just exclusive to the home version of Max

1313
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,920
USA.

1314
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,280
This time around, instead of giving out my normal prizes, which would be videos and DVDs

1315
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,400
and stuff, I'm giving out pornography!

1316
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,400
Porno tapes!

1317
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,400
Yay!

1318
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:39,920
And so we have Make It Get Porn, just like the title says.

1319
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,120
And you'll get a big box of, you know, porno tapes, pretty much that consist of mostly

1320
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,120
Playboy movies.

1321
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:48,960
I mean, I don't really consider them porn, I mean, they're kind of skidimax, they're

1322
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,360
kind of porn, but they're not, I don't know, it's hard to say.

1323
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:56,680
But you know, you'll get those, and I mean, those are pretty expensive, actually, they're

1324
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,760
about $22.98 a piece, so you are saving quite a bit of money to be able to go out and buy

1325
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,660
those tapes and find out that they're crap.

1326
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:32,660
If a woman wins, then we'll just have to find some boy porn to throw in the box.

1327
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:33,660
Yes.

1328
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:34,660
Pun intended.

1329
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:43,660
Anyways, so that's going on, and like I said, you've got no time to do it.

1330
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:48,780
So get your Trini Mix 3 stuff done this week, and then get your Make It Again Porn stuff

1331
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,980
done next week.

1332
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,380
All right, that was Make It Again Porn.

1333
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:55,700
Let's talk about some new shit that's coming out in Japan soon.

1334
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:59,100
We've got the Dance Mania series, you hear some of their tracks here right here on Orange

1335
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,100
Lawn's radio.

1336
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:02,100
They've got some new albums coming out very soon.

1337
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:06,940
On December 11th, Classical Speed comes out.

1338
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:10,540
That's all your favorite classical tunes on fucking crack.

1339
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:15,240
Oh, we even have some real audio clips we can play for you.

1340
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,840
This is the Radetsky March by Strauss.

1341
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,860
We're going to listen to a clip of that.

1342
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:21,340
This is from the Classical Speed album.

1343
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,340
This is track number two.

1344
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:23,340
Hopefully this works.

1345
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,740
Perform a speed orchestra.

1346
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:27,180
This is by the Speed Orchestra.

1347
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,180
It's queuing up here.

1348
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,180
Give it a minute.

1349
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:33,220
preview of classical speed right here on Orange Lawn's radio, which is timing out

1350
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:40,220
on me. Wait, here we go. Loading, loading, here we go.

1351
01:51:40,220 --> 01:52:08,880
That was the Rydetsky March.

1352
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,800
That was done by the Speed Orchestra.

1353
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,520
Other ones that should be noted, they have the Saber Dance.

1354
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,000
No, we don't have a clip of Saber Dance, unfortunately.

1355
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,280
Swan Lake, Marchy, Military, Victory March.

1356
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,280
Want to hear a Victory March?

1357
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,440
Or how about, how about let's hear a clip of Ode to Joy.

1358
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:30,120
This is a Beethoven song, so let's hear this clip of Ode to Joy.

1359
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,120
Everybody knows this song.

1360
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:34,160
Everybody who ever took piano had to play this song at one point or another.

1361
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,160
Another?

1362
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,160
Let's hear this one.

1363
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:43,160
by the way

1364
01:52:43,160 --> 01:53:06,160
Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin!

1365
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:10,160
Very nice. Somebody in the shower room says, oh, that's kind of like end of the century.

1366
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:16,160
Yes. First of all, End of the Century is kind of like Ode to Joy, get it right.

1367
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:21,160
It's a little bit similar, yes. There's a brand new Captain Jack album coming out.

1368
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:27,160
Rock the Fuck On. It's called Party Warriors. Fucking rock, that's all I had to say.

1369
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:31,160
We only have a clip of one song, but it's got a great name, so I'm sure it's awesome.

1370
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:36,160
This is a song called Centerfold, and actually it looks like this album is just a bunch of remixes.

1371
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:40,560
So we got Heya, Iko Iko, Party Warriors, and this one, Centerfold.

1372
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,360
Hey, hey, it's a bag!

1373
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:47,860
Oh my gosh, it's Centerfold.

1374
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:52,660
Dude, I'm gonna be 80 to make you into that.

1375
01:53:52,660 --> 01:54:10,060
Go captain, go captain, go captain, alright that was a centerfold, a little bit of a clip

1376
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:11,900
there.

1377
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:17,260
And also coming out, Dance Mania Speed 10.

1378
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,740
And this is going to scare a lot of you.

1379
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:26,560
The very first track is Nancy and the Boys, and they're covering everybody's favorite

1380
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:32,600
artist these days. They're doing a cover of an Avril Lavigne song. Let's hear how awful

1381
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,600
it is.

1382
01:54:33,600 --> 01:55:03,460
I can be on a speed album, jesus!

1383
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:09,460
Oh, the OSF-EB wants a cover of Dirty on Speed 10. No, unfortunately that's not going to happen.

1384
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:16,460
But we do get some other cool stuff. We have A Little Less Conversation. That was the Elvis song that made a big comeback. We have a clip of that.

1385
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:20,460
That's the second track on the album. Done by the CJ Crew.

1386
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:27,460
who did some

1387
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:44,180
yeah i don't really like this what else is on the album

1388
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:47,340
uh... wild child privatized give it up relax

1389
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:50,640

01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,480

1396

joy to the world saber dance drop-top heaven

1398
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:12,580
of god i hope that's not a cover of the deejays sammy song

1399
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:16,260
we might be in for some real hell on speed ten yeah i know which cover brian

1400
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:25,260
Radio Rockin', Want Your Love, Here To Stay, and we have another clip of Sectember by DJ Speedo. Love the name.

1401
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,260
It's almost as lovely as DJ Mangu.

1402
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:38,260
I know this song. This is probably going to be like a DVR.

1403
01:56:38,260 --> 01:57:07,280
So those are some new things that we can look forward to from the

1404
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,880
Toshiba EMI series is coming out very soon.

1405
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,960
And since we never really talked about it, let's talk about some other things that we've

1406
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,040
had come out recently.

1407
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:21,920
DanceMania EX-1 just came out not too long ago, had some good stuff on it.

1408
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:25,800
The return of Smile DK, Captain Jack and Erotic all on a DanceMania album, that was pretty

1409
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,800
cool.

1410
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:31,280
And Lollipop, actually I do have Lollipop on my CD that I brought today.

1411
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,520
Oh, cool.

1412
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,160
I do have Lollipop actually on the drive somewhere.

1413
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:40,920
I'll be perfectly happy if I don't have to hear that song, thank you.

1414
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,340
I also have doggy style.

1415
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:49,040
That sounds scary.

1416
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,680
Weird, I didn't realize people left the house here.

1417
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:55,240
I just had somebody come online who I thought was here at the house.

1418
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,540
Uh, let's...

1419
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:00,880
I guess we're going to go to a break, and when we come back we're going to do a list list.

1420
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:04,040
I don't know if we have enough people to do a list list. Do we still have one person here?

1421
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:07,540
I think she's still playing

1422
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:10,780
Animal Crossing. We'll see if we have enough people to do listless.

1423
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:15,020
We'll try to do that. If not, we'll think of something. We'll just do a three-person

1424
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:17,360
listless if we have to.

1425
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,660
We'll do a three-person listless if we have to. Fine.

1426
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:25,300
In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and I had a request for something, and I don't even remember what it was.

1427
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,380
I could talk about NewTek porn.

1428
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:31,080
Okay, talk about what you want to talk about.

1429
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:35,280
hold on let me see if we have anybody else in the front room to do

1430
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,760
I get the chair

1431
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:39,920
No you don't, I get the chair

1432
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,160
Comfy

1433
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,380
He's

1434
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:45,680
looking semi-orgasmic now

1435
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,320
It feels so good

1436
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,940
Is it squishy?

1437
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:54,100
Anyways, NewTek. NewTek's a new

1438
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,160
studio we actually start distributing at my company now

1439
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,680
they're an adult anime studio

1440
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:05,840
and they were so kindly enough to send me three samples of their products.

1441
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,360
So, here today

1442
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,760
I am going to review three different titles. We have Leather Man

1443
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,280
volume three,

1444
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:17,240
we have DNA Hunters volume one, and we also have one called

1445
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:22,840
uh... shut out, I don't remember the last one. I think Kelly or Katie, I can't remember what the name is.

1446
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:26,120
I'll just call it Katie.

1447
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:29,360
So, start off with DNA Hunter volume one.

1448
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:35,760
uh... this is a story about

1449
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,540
reviewing an important

1450
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:42,560
the other it's a basically about there's this woman her husband died

1451
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,780
and she really wants to have a and

1452
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:47,280
problem is that she was ever husband's baby so

1453
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,920
in order to do that she has to kind of cloned his DNA or something like that

1454
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,840
anyways

1455
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:54,320
so in order to get the money to do this she has to become a DNA hunter now what

1456
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,580
DNA hunter is is basically

1457
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,560
it's a woman

1458
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:01,840
Women come to this company, and they say, I want this man's baby.

1459
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,840
So in order to do that, they have to have these women that work for this company go

1460
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:11,680
and have sex with these people, and then they collect the DNA, or semen, from these people,

1461
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:17,520
and then turn sell it to the women that want to have those, you know, celebrities' babies.

1462
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,400
Thus, DNA Hunter.

1463
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,880
I have to say that this was an utter disappointment.

1464
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,920
The title sucked ass.

1465
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:26,120
It really was boring as hell.

1466
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:35,120
Um, the very first, um, the thing that she has to act, the guy she has to have sex with is her, like, old boss from her previous job who's, like, this really old guy.

1467
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:40,120
And no one wants to see some hot chick screw in an old guy, even if it is animated, so.

1468
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:45,120
Really awful. I hear the rest of the series is good, but no. Awful, awful, awful.

1469
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,120
Leather Man Volume 3.

1470
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:52,120
Pretty interesting, um, title since I have to start watching it in the middle.

1471
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:56,120
It's basically this guy carrying around a sack of money.

1472
02:00:56,120 --> 02:01:00,120
I don't know why he's carrying around a sack of money, because obviously I haven't seen the first episode, so I don't really know.

1473
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:06,120
And he's going around and people just start having sex with him for no apparent reason whatsoever.

1474
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:12,120
They're trying to steal the money, and it's kind of like Golden Boy, but X-rated.

1475
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:20,120
You've got the guy, he's making women feel better about themselves, giving them more confidence and stuff, yet has sex with them and stuff like that.

1476
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:27,120
I don't know. It's pretty good. No real plot to get in the way. Lots of sex. Fun, fun, fun.

1477
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:33,120
The other one, I believe it was called Katie. I can't remember what the actual name was.

1478
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:43,120
It's about this kind of cheerleader, not really a cheerleader, but she's like the head of the, kind of the pep team or whatever.

1479
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:55,120
And she is being blackmailed by the rest of her team to do all these things like, you know, do cheers with, like, a vibrant strap dinner and stuff, and kind of stuff like that.

1480
02:01:55,120 --> 02:02:02,120
And she ends up at the very end turning into a slut. So you get to watch this, you know, cute girl get transformed into a slut at the end of the movie.

1481
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:07,120
So, of course, everyone likes that. That's it. That's all I've got.

1482
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,120
Beautiful.

1483
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:13,000
a quick break and we'll be back to talk about something bimani related and maybe actually we're

1484
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
gonna do a list list when we come back by request this break this is the only song we're gonna play

1485
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,680
this break because it's kind of long it's six minutes long but it's very cool it's out phase

1486
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:26,440
doing 0.59 live so uh it starts off a little bit quiet though so don't think that we dropped or

1487
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:30,920
anything it just has a quiet intro it's got one of those windy noises things so uh enjoy this song

1488
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,920
and we'll be back.

1489
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,920
Oh

1490
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:49,160
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1491
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:50,160
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1492
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:51,160
No!

1493
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,160
Do we care what people think of us?

1494
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:53,160
No!

1495
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,160
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1496
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:55,160
Yes!

1497
02:08:55,160 --> 02:09:07,560
of us? No! Do we want people to kiss our ass? Yeah! Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange

1498
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:14,680
Lounge Radio. Hello once again my friends, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio pre-taped

1499
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:20,200
this week. We're live on Saturday night, December the 7th, but this is actually technically

1500
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:25,520
the show for December the 8th. It'll be played both nights. So we're gonna do a

1501
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,940
little segment called List List. It's everybody's favorite. Tonight the topic

1502
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:36,140
is, and those of you in the chat room will get to assist us with voting on the

1503
02:09:36,140 --> 02:09:45,100
winners of this, tonight's topic is the top three things I hate about Christmas.

1504
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:50,100
Yes, it's the top things that we hate about Christmas.

1505
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:58,100
The way the list works, the list list segment works is that we're going to compile a list.

1506
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:05,100
Our fabulous in-studio celebrities will compile a list of their top things that they hate about Christmas.

1507
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:09,100
And then one by one we'll each eliminate something that we hate about Christmas,

1508
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:12,100
or that we might actually like about Christmas, someone else hates.

1509
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:14,100
Things that should not be on the list.

1510
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:21,100
And then the chat room will vote on the ultimate list of things that they hate about Christmas.

1511
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Let's start off. Who started last time?

1512
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:26,100
Jamie, did you start last week? I don't remember. Let's start with Loki.

1513
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,100
Let's start with Loki.

1514
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:31,100
Loki, what is the number three thing that you hate about Christmas?

1515
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:35,100
Gotti Christmas decorations.

1516
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:41,100
Basically, you know, the white trash light setups, you know, in front of people's houses.

1517
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:44,100
Gotti Christmas Decorations is number three on...

1518
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:47,100
Does it look like Christmas threw up all over the houses?

1519
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,100
Exactly.

1520
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:52,100
We were just driving down the street the other day and Jamie said,

1521
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:56,100
Christmas barfed on that house. Christmas barfed on that house.

1522
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:59,100
So, Gotti Christmas Decorations, Loki's number three answer.

1523
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:02,100
We have the Rice Princess in the studio. She's helping us out tonight with Listless.

1524
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:07,100
Irene, what is your number three pick for Thing You Hate About Christmas?

1525
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:13,180
Well, you have to say dumb, nosy relatives.

1526
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:16,940
When you have to see those relatives you never see but Christmas time and they always want

1527
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:17,940
to know what you're doing.

1528
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:19,780
It's like, well, if I wanted you to know, I would have told you.

1529
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:22,740
I would have sent you a letter or called you or something.

1530
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:25,540
Dumb, nosy relatives, Irene's number three answer.

1531
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:26,540
Very nice, very nice.

1532
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:27,540
Thank you.

1533
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:31,560
My number three answer would be parking lots.

1534
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:36,740
I hate parking lots normally and around Christmas time, it gets ten times as worse.

1535
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:41,800
People cannot drive in a parking lot, they are cutthroat going for each other's spaces,

1536
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,520
they stay and they park their car in the middle of the aisle, so when you're trying to go

1537
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:49,040
around to get a spot, you're trapped there, that shit pisses me off more than anything

1538
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,160
else in the whole world.

1539
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:56,400
Jamie, you're number three pick for something you hate about Christmas.

1540
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,920
Decorations going up before Halloween.

1541
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:05,440
Oh, decorations that go up before Halloween, very nice.

1542
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:09,320
What about decorations that stay up after Valentine's Day?

1543
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:15,040
I don't know what to steal out there, I just don't like them going up for my favorite holiday.

1544
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,160
Alright, what if they're orange lights though?

1545
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:20,800
If it's for Halloween, then sure.

1546
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:21,800
Cool.

1547
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,800
Alright.

1548
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,560
Loki, your number two answer for a thing that pisses you off about Christmas.

1549
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:29,880
Christmas music.

1550
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:30,880
All of it.

1551
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:32,680
All of it must go.

1552
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,200
Don't change your music programming.

1553
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:42,080
the artist that made it. Hunt them down. I will pay ransom. Actually, bounty. A bounty

1554
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:47,080
for everybody that makes Christmas music. I want them all dead.

1555
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:51,840
Okay. All right, Christmas music. Irene, your number two answer.

1556
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:58,520
Having no money or resources to buy or make gifts.

1557
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:04,360
Sex. Anything else you want to elaborate on there?

1558
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:08,500
All right.

1559
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:15,660
My number two answer is political correctness.

1560
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:19,100
Because somewhere right now there's probably somebody that would be whining about how we

1561
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:23,920
shouldn't say Christmas because it's the winter holiday season and everybody celebrates something

1562
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:24,920
different.

1563
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:25,920
But you know what?

1564
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,040
There are some people out there that don't even celebrate holidays.

1565
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:29,740
So you know what?

1566
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:33,940
Just Christmas for all practical purposes means everything, okay?

1567
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:37,940
I'm not like a Bible-thumper religious person, but I just say, Christmas, it's presents,

1568
02:13:37,940 --> 02:13:38,940
you get stuff.

1569
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:42,400
I don't care what other people celebrate, but don't freakin' get all huffy and puffy

1570
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:46,220
when somebody else, you know, celebrates something you don't.

1571
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:48,260
You don't have to try so damn hard to be different.

1572
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,260
Just go with it.

1573
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:50,260
Rawr!

1574
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:53,780
I hate political correctness.

1575
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:57,260
And this, the thing that kind of triggered this was that we have this thing at work that

1576
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:01,780
we do every winter, and we're not even allowed to call it, we can't call it a Christmas party,

1577
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:03,380
You can't call it a Hanukkah party.

1578
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:04,920
We can't call it a Kwanzaa party.

1579
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:09,060
We can't even call it a holiday party because not everyone celebrates holidays.

1580
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:13,780
We have to call it a winter appreciation party.

1581
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:15,180
That is so stupid.

1582
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:23,420
Jamie, your number two thing that you hate about Christmas?

1583
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:26,700
I have one that's more personal, so I'm not going to say that one.

1584
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,700
Okay.

1585
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:28,700
I'll mention it.

1586
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:32,980
like being away from my family for the fourth Christmas in a row, you know, since they're

1587
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:36,060
all out in Alabama, so I'll put it this way.

1588
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:43,380
I think that what I don't like about the whole holiday season is just that, how over commercialized

1589
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:44,700
it is.

1590
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:48,500
Over commercialized, all right.

1591
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:52,300
You know, it's always buy, buy, buy, buy, and people don't seem to realize that there's

1592
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:58,460
supposed to be more meaning to the season than just, I mean, I like shopping for gifts

1593
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:04,640
like giving them because that's just how I am but there's when it's being used as

1594
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:09,820
an excuse for more people to put money in their pockets I don't like that

1595
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:15,460
all right that's a very good rant I like that all right Loki number one thing

1596
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:19,700
that pisses you off about Christmas those people dressed up like Santa

1597
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:24,940
Claus outside of grocery stores outside of malls everything working for the

1598
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:30,720
The Salvation Army. F you to the Salvation Army. They don't need my money any time of

1599
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:36,880
the year, nor during Christmas, and they aren't getting a penny of it.

1600
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,120
Thank you, Mr. Grinch.

1601
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:39,120
Thank you.

1602
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,120
Gosh, Scrooge.

1603
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:43,560
I hope you see the three ghosts.

1604
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,560
All right.

1605
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,560
I'm kidding.

1606
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:48,140
Irene, the number one thing you hate about Christmas.

1607
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:53,880
Not knowing what to get people for Christmas. I hate it. Just tell me what you want, what

1608
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:56,980
you really, really want, and I'll get it for you.

1609
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:59,880
Not knowing what to give people, alright, good answer.

1610
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:04,700
My number one answer is already on the list, but I'll just say it anyway, we'll just have

1611
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:05,760
a duplicate.

1612
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:10,200
My number one thing I hate about Christmas is Christmas carols, so that goes right along

1613
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,200
with Christmas music.

1614
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:14,400
You can pick something other than Christmas carols on the line.

1615
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:21,840
Okay, how about Christmas carolers?

1616
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:26,240
Like the beginning of the Addams Family movie? That's the best thing ever.

1617
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:32,820
I hate, okay, I was going to say you could have used this one. Christmas TV specials.

1618
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:37,160
No, because the Grinch is cool. No, no, no. I'm not talking about the Grinch.

1619
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:40,720
Grinch is cool, keep the Grinch. If I'm talking about like they have this one here, it's a

1620
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:45,360
musical special with John Ritter hosting. John Ritter should not be on TV.

1621
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:50,440
Not since Three's Company anyway. Yeah, Three's Company was cool.

1622
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:57,080
All right, Jamie, the number one answer.

1623
02:16:57,080 --> 02:17:02,640
Misinterpretation of the holiday, as in all these, and I have to give background, I was

1624
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:09,140
born Southern Baptist, you know, I still believe in God in general, but I lean more toward

1625
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:14,120
the pagan side of my beliefs, and I love it when people go, oh, Jesus was born on Christmas

1626
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:15,120
Day.

1627
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,120
That's bullshit!

1628
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,400
He was born in like June, okay?

1629
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:22,320
This is a pagan holiday, okay?

1630
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:28,880
The yule tree, the log, you know, the candles, all of it is a pagan holiday.

1631
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,440
Get it right.

1632
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:34,720
If you want dates and proof and everything, I can go grab all of my college books and

1633
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,280
pull that right up where that tradition started.

1634
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:40,120
I actually think that somebody posted a link in the chat room if you want more information

1635
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:41,120
on that.

1636
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,120
Thank you.

1637
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,120
I think.

1638
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:46,920
I am so sick of this, and that's part of the reason why I stopped going to the specials

1639
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,520
at church was because of this.

1640
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:52,040
Oh, Christmas Day, blah, blah, no!

1641
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:53,800
You're wrong, you're stupid.

1642
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:57,760
You're buying into what you've been fed all of your life.

1643
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,160
Try thinking for yourself.

1644
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:01,160
I don't like that.

1645
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,880
No, that's my number one pet peeve about Christmas.

1646
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:04,880
Alright.

1647
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:08,840
I just stopped going to church because it was damn boring, and I didn't really care.

1648
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:12,400
Except there was this one priest that looked like Weirdo Yankovic, and that entertained

1649
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:15,960
myself enough to stay away for about half of it.

1650
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:19,960
All right. Boy, not a single Balmani-related thing on this list. I'm really proud of you

1651
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:27,280
guys. Okay. You know what? I don't know. I'm going to entertain something here in the studio

1652
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:31,040
here. I don't think I feel comfortable eliminating any of these, because they're all things that

1653
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,400
really suck about Christmas. So I think as a Christmas present, we should let our chat

1654
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,240
room pick from all of these options. What do you guys think?

1655
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:37,240
Sure.

1656
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:40,840
All right. So we're not going to eliminate anything. You guys can pick anything from

1657
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:43,760
this list, because I don't know about the others, but I don't...

1658
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,480
We're extra bitter today.

1659
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:49,120
i don't uh... i can't i don't see anything on this list i really feel

1660
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:53,000
comfortable getting rid of so i can't even at the list i hate the stupid like

1661
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,840
people that come around working on the wedding

1662
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,080
the boy scouts and girl scouts want me to buy shit

1663
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:01,920
i didn't need to know gracias

1664
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:02,940
but but but

1665
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,240

1666
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:10,200
the adams family is like the best christmas movie

1667
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,960
uh... some things that the uh... channel girl scout chat room suggestions that

1668
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:14,960
that we missed.

1669
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:15,960
Blood chip flavor.

1670
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,880
Things in the chatroom that we missed.

1671
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:18,880
Eggnog.

1672
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:19,880
I like eggnog.

1673
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:21,560
I know, I like eggnog too.

1674
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:23,840
I like alcoholic eggnog.

1675
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,680
Getting socks and underwear.

1676
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:29,160
Hey, I could use that, okay?

1677
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:31,240
My socks and underwear just disappear.

1678
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:36,640
They just like, whoa, whoa, damn underpants gnomes.

1679
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:37,880
Underpants gnomes.

1680
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:40,920
And let's see, what else did they say?

1681
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:43,100
and they were saying Silent Hill owns you.

1682
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:44,620
I guess that's it.

1683
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:45,740
Those are the only two things.

1684
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:47,220
Okay, so send in your votes now

1685
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:49,140
over private message in the channel.

1686
02:19:49,140 --> 02:19:51,360
And to celebrate, how about a little Christmas cheer

1690
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
A special day

Tonight is the night for our lovers

1692
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
We wish we could have

1693
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
This feeling

1694
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Through the weather here

1695
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Christmas is here

1696
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Christmas is here

1697
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:00,000
If you, I want you, I want you, I want you

1698
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Night falls on you

1699

You can buy me what you want

1701
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:21,920
Night, nightfall, it's the start of a new year

1702
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:27,000
Oh, I'm falling, no, I can't, I must love you to be here

1703
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:33,000

Can you hear me from above?

1705
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Do you feel the face of me?

1706
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
What's been through?

1707
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
We do in the air

1708
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Just in time

1709
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:05,000
No one cares to stop Can you see me from above?

1710
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Do you share my frozen memories? Set it down

1711
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:22,000

Let it in, let it out, let it out

1713

Let us love, let it in

Please give me a new star tonight

1715
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:42,000
To create a world full

Let's not face me Please give me back my yesterday

02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Let's not face me

1719
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Oh

1720
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:45,000
We indeed do have a list.

1721
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:20,280
Here is the final list of the top three things you all hate about Christmas.

1722
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:22,600
We helped, you voted, here it is.

1723
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:34,080
The number three thing that you hate about Christmas is Christmas carolers.

1724
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:40,160
The number two thing you hate about Christmas is that it's over commercialized, with hallmarks

1725
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:42,680
stamped on the back.

1726
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:47,920
And the number one thing that everybody in the chat room and we all hate about Christmas

1727
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:50,840
is political correctness.

1728
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:51,840
Yeah.

1729
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,080
And that's correct spelled with one R.

1730
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:57,400
Shut up, shut up.

1731
02:27:57,400 --> 02:27:58,400
Just shut up.

1732
02:27:58,400 --> 02:27:59,400
Correct.

1733
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:02,920
Oh, they're saying I should use the movie, they're saying I should use the movie phone

1734
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:03,920
voice.

1740
02:28:31,940 --> 02:28:35,940
Oh, yes, we haven't heard from Mr. Spanky yet tonight.

1741
02:28:35,940 --> 02:28:39,460
I do believe we're going to do a Mr. Spanky update a little later.

1742
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:41,740
Oh, now you're not so sure?

1743
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:42,980
We need good porn tips.

1744
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:43,980
We need good porn tips?

1745
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:44,980
Yes.

1746
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:45,980
Okay.

1747
02:28:45,980 --> 02:28:48,260
Well, we'll get Mr. Spanky back on the show right before it's over.

1748
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,260
How's that sound?

1749
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:50,260
Okay.

1750
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,260
All right, cool.

1751
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:52,260
Jamie, you've got to explain.

1752
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:53,980
I noticed one F.U. you left out.

1753
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:58,580
I don't remember if you talked about it last week, but you've got these Leet Max 2 shoes

1754
02:28:58,580 --> 02:28:59,580
and they're breaking.

1755
02:28:59,580 --> 02:29:05,420
I bought these vans, they're black and they have flames going up the sides and they're

1756
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,660
already starting to tear up.

1757
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:11,020
My last pair of vans lost to me like a whole freaking year and these are just falling to

1758
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:14,700
bits so I got to get new man shoes.

1759
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:18,500
But I'm going to wear these until they die, damn it.

1760
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:25,460
Okay, I'm being asked to read a paper that 23rd Magus wrote that he got an A on.

1761
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:28,580
It better be Bimani related or I'm not going to do it.

1762
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:37,860
Oh yeah, there's an article in the paper, tell us about that, Matt.

1763
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:40,460
Fuckin' vinyl, I haven't read it.

1764
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:48,220
Anyways, my friend Eric, also known as Punkknight, he wrote an article in, I don't remember what

1765
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:49,220
the magazine is.

1766
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:56,980
Oh, it's a local paper here, uh, help me, don't, uh, Wired Herd or something like that?

1767
02:29:56,980 --> 02:29:57,980
Wired Head, I bet.

1768
02:29:57,980 --> 02:30:05,980
Yeah, something like that. Anyways, Wired Head magazine, and it's about DDR. I think Rob gets quoted on it.

1769
02:30:05,980 --> 02:30:08,980
Yeah, apparently. I haven't even seen it yet. I need to find a copy of it.

1770
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:15,940
I know that there's a few down where my friend works, if you're local, down in Folsom at

1771
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:28,940
uh, at um, shit, Pizza Place, um, Ciro's Pizza Place at um, Bloorveen and Prairie City Road.

1772
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:34,280
So if you're local in Folsom, you can check it out there, otherwise, wherever Wired heads

1773
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:35,280
at.

1774
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:41,580
it like it enjoy it there I'm sorry well Matt was talking about wirehead Jamie is

1775
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:45,180
noticing that if you shake a bottle or propel like a lot and then let it sit

1776
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:55,800
there it looks like cum tasty this looks like it could do a lot of damage to some

1777
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:59,500
sort of bodily orifice this propel bottle and and well Jamie what was your

1778
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:02,420
comment as soon as you took a sip of that shake and water it ain't salty

1779
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:04,420
That's right, it ain't salty.

1780
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:06,420
Alright.

1781
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:07,420

02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,420
Your HP tastes good.

02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:12,420
Okay, here we go.

1785
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:13,420
We're going to talk now.

1786
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:14,420
We're going to read this paper.

1787
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:17,420
It is Bemani-related because it's about Shaft.

1788
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:18,420
That tournament.

1789
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:21,420
So, 23rd Magus wrote this paper for one of his classes,

1790
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:22,420
so I thought we'd read it,

1791
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:24,420
and I'll give our little smart-ass comments on it.

1792
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:25,420
How's that sound?

1793
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:27,420
Here we go.

1794
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:29,420
Yes, that's right.

1795
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:31,420
Reading the paper, reading the paper.

1796
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:33,420
Stand by to win.

1797
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:37,420
I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.

1798
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:42,420
One of my favorite and strangest hobbies is playing Dance Dance Revolution,

1799
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:46,420
an arcade game in which you must step on arrow panels in time to the music.

1800
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:50,420
Many people, such as myself, go further than the game requires,

1801
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:55,420
working the arrows into a dance routine, in other words, weave freestyle.

1802
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:57,420
Recently...

1803
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:59,420
Not if you're white.

1804
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:00,420
What?

1805
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,420
Keep reading.

1806
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:04,420
What are you laughing at, Logan?

1807
02:32:04,420 --> 02:32:10,420
Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy at...

1808
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:11,420
What?

1809
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:12,420
Read!

1810
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:14,420
No, I want to know what the joke is.

1811
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:15,420
Read.

1812
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:17,420
Here, you shut it down.

1813
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:18,420
Alright.

1814
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:19,420
Oh, okay.

1815
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:20,420
Okay.

1816
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:21,420
Can I finish?

1817
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:22,420
Can I finish?

1818
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,420
Can I finish?

1819
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:24,420
Can I finish?

1820
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,420
Thank you.

1821
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:26,420
Yes.

1822
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:28,420
Okay, moving on with 23 Magus's Paper.

1823
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:34,420
Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DER tournament for those playing accuracy and freestylers.

1824
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:41,420
The organizers decided to call it SHAPT. Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

1825
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:47,420
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Sacbimani hosts another fabulous tournament. Oh, you get docked three points for that.

1826
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:51,420
He said Sacramento, not Sacbimani, so he gets docked three points.

1827
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:55,420
It was quite witty, if I do say so myself.

1828
02:32:55,420 --> 02:33:01,420
I suppose I should go into detail about the three types of competition and exactly why they are important.

1829
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:03,420
I've never seen anyone talk in an English paper.

1830
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:06,420
Well, I suppose I ought to talk about this.

1831
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:09,420
I suppose I ought to do my assignment.

1832
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:12,420
Alright.

1833
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:17,420
That way I don't leave non-DDR players, you unfortunate souls, you in the dust.

1834
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:21,420
Accuracy attack is your standard play of DDR.

1835
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:24,420
The object of the game is to hit every arrow step with the right timing.

1836
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:31,420
I was not present during this competition, so you, dear reader, will be spared the agonizing details. Consider yourself lucky.

1837
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:45,420
Regular freestyle players take the steps for a song and work them into a dance routine.

1838
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:49,460
The routine always varies depending on the song and freestyler.

1839
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:53,860
Some amazing feats have taken place in this competition, and their excitement levels rivals

1840
02:33:53,860 --> 02:34:00,300
that of any extreme sport.

1841
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:04,820
A-Team Freestyle, also known as Old School Freestyle, is a demonstration of freestyling

1842
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:12,020
techniques from several years back.

1843
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:15,700
These routines utilize the safety bars at the back of the arcade machine, and incorporate

1844
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:20,500
moves such as hand plants, hitting an arrow with hands instead of feet, and knee drops,

1845
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,980
landing on an arrow with knees.

1846
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:26,980
These often cause great pain to the performo- performo-

1847
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:30,940
Nowadays, A-Team routines are generally considered childish and not cool anymore.

1848
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:35,700
Personally, I think that A-Team routines have their biggest wow factor, but many don't share

1849
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:37,960
my opinion.

1850
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:41,260
Now that we're done with the background, let's get into the real meat of this.

1851
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:44,380
I am, of course, talking about how I fit into this whole picture.

1852
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:49,580
Through a little negotiating, green-whining, I managed to get into Shaft as an observer,

1853
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:52,020
so I thought... or so I thought.

1854
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:57,260
Instead, I participated in the most embarrassing and the most fun activity of my life, competing

1855
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:59,460
in freestyles.

1856
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:03,820
Uh, here's the rundown.

1857
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:08,020
Midway through the freestyle competition, Rob and Janie, the MC and tournament organizer,

1858
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:11,240
noticed that not enough people had signed up for competition.

1859
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:18,240
I then decided to make an improv as a national freestyle category, which was one-third of the normal $15 entry fee.

1860
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:21,240
Having only $10 on me, I decided to go for it.

1861
02:35:21,240 --> 02:35:22,240
Here was the catch.

1862
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:27,240
Since it was improv, the machine was set to roulette mode, which selects a song at random.

1863
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:31,240
If I had been able to pick my own song, things would have been momentally different.

1864
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:33,240
Monumentally different.

1865
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:36,240
Momentally, monumentally different.

1866
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:37,240
Damn you, big words.

1867
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:41,240
Namely, I probably would have had a routine set up, which defeats the purpose of improv.

1868
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:46,240
As it was, I embarrassed myself royally, doing rave moves to a bubblegum pop song.

1869
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:51,240
It was entertaining in its incognuity, but it was not a winner.

1870
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:53,240
Not a winner.

1871
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:55,240
Stand by to lose.

1872
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:57,240
Stand by to lose.

1873
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:58,240
Boom.

1874
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:03,240
Anyway, the wild part of my experience was not in my improv entry, but in what happened while waiting.

1875
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,240
It was chaos incarnate.

1876
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:08,440
Good friend Justin was going crazy with the deep fryer, dropping in everything he thought

1877
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:09,840
he could get away with.

1878
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,080
I still remember stuffing my face with deep fried Twinkies and candy corn.

1879
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:16,120
It was fun, albeit messy.

1880
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:19,800
Much of the time I was in the party room slash broadcast booth, talking with my friends and

1881
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:22,000
helping out with the Orange Lounge Radio broadcast.

1882
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,640
The broadcast was full of inside jokes, all of which were too rude and obscure to mention.

1883
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:31,560
I do remember Justin taking over the airwaves, telling me to stop hitting them, although

1884
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:46,120
Although I was doing no such thing, it was so moderately funny.

1885
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:49,800
A few times I came out of the party room to watch some freestylers work their magic on

1886
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:50,800
the stage.

1887
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:53,720
It is from one of the routines that my story gets its name.

1888
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:58,400
Mr. Wendell, a popular freestyler, was doing a comedy routine to Orion 7-8, one of the

1889
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:00,120
more annoying songs.

1890
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:03,880
One of his friends was holding up a hot roast beef sandwich, playing keep away with poor

1891
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:04,880
Wendell.

1892
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:08,760
At certain points in the song, the crowd, scooping the song lyrics, chanted, Roast beef!

1893
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:09,760
Roast beef!

1894
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,760
Hot!

1895
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:11,760
Hot!

1896
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:12,760
Hot!

1897
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,760
Hot!

1898
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:16,240
The whole routine had me literally on the floor laughing, especially at the end, where

1899
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:21,480
Wendell finally snatched the sandwich, took a bite, then backhanded his buddy, who was

1900
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:22,480
sneaking up behind him.

1901
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:23,480
That was Holland, wasn't it?

1902
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:24,480
Yes, it was.

1903
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:25,480
Applause.

1904
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:28,780
Applause. Rob, always the charmer, stood on stage and declared,

1905
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:31,280
I love stories with happy endings, don't you?

1906
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:41,480
More applause accompanied by laughter and wolf whistles, a few of which I must admit were mine.

1907
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:46,280
Aww, that was a beautiful paper. Thank you for sharing that with us. That was the end, right?

1908
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:50,580
Oops, I did it again. I closed the window.

1909
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:54,480
Oh well, I'm assuming that was the end of the paper. Oh, here it is.

1910
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:56,480
Yes, that was the end of the paper.

1911
02:37:56,480 --> 02:38:00,480
Very well written. How do you guys think he did on that? What kind of grade?

1912
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:03,480
It was out of 36 points, I'll tell you that. What do you think he got?

1913
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,480
I give it a 34.

1914
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:07,480
34. Out of 36 points. What would you give it, Logie?

1915
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:08,480
It was grammatically correct.

1916
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:09,480
Yes.

1917
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:12,480
What grade's he in?

1918
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:15,480
I don't know. In high school.

1919
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:21,480
I think he's freshman or sophomore. That's a guess.

1920
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:26,480
I guess it was alright. It started going off topic towards the end though.

1921
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:37,480
I mean, you were explaining the different categories in DDR and then all of a sudden you just saw something else. I don't know.

1922
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:42,480
It sounds a lot like my senior project.

1923
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:43,480
No.

1924
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:47,900
See, what happens, I think what happens is you procrastinate and you wait till the last

1925
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:51,380
minute to write your paper and it ends up coming out like this.

1926
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:52,940
So what do you think, Rob?

1927
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:53,940
You guys have got to give me grades.

1928
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:54,940
What did you get?

1929
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:55,940
Grades?

1930
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:56,940
Hold on, Matt.

1931
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:57,940
What did you get?

1932
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:58,940
I have 36 points.

1933
02:38:58,940 --> 02:38:59,940
34.0596 points.

1934
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:04,780
All right, very nice.

1935
02:39:04,780 --> 02:39:07,740
For grammatical correctness, yes, I guess I'll give it to you.

1936
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:08,740
Oh, my bad.

1937
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:09,740
He's a senior.

1938
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:10,740
My bad.

1939
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:11,740
He's a senior in high school.

1940
02:39:11,740 --> 02:39:13,740
That's bad. He's getting pissed.

1941
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:15,740
In that case, F.

1942
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:17,740
In that case, F, you should know better.

1943
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:21,740
There's not much difference between freshmen and seniors when it comes to curriculum when I was in high school.

1944
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:23,740
Your grade, Brad?

1945
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:25,740
I'd say 31.

1946
02:39:25,740 --> 02:39:27,740
31? No, you give him a B.

1947
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:32,740
I give him 59. I give him 59 points for that. That was beautiful.

1948
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:34,740
There is no 59, you fuckhead.

1949
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:40,740
No, but this is what's funny. You know how many points he did get? 33. He got 33 points.

1950
02:39:40,740 --> 02:39:45,740
three points for missing the Sac-Pomani thing, just like we said.

1951
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:50,740
You know what? I only learned two things in high school.

1952
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:55,740
What's that? How to avoid people, and then a mole of 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

1953
02:39:55,740 --> 02:40:00,740
I'm doing the way over my head thing right now where I put my hand up.

1954
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:05,740
I took AP chemistry.

1955
02:40:05,740 --> 02:40:15,980
gave that paper a double S. That's winner. Oh, I'm vibrating. It's vibrating, but it's

1956
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:22,340
a restricted vibrate, so I don't want to answer restricted numbers. Okay, um, wow, we've still

1957
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:28,540
got about a good fifteen minutes to fill in the show. No, no ferret filling. What else

1958
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:33,980
can we talk about? You brat, you wanna rant about something? Hey, fucking guy! This is

1959
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:40,980
Gurbal. Your daughter, she come to my house, and she kicked my dog. I wanna tell a joke.

1960
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:47,660
I wanna tell a joke. Okay. I need joke music. I need the... You guys all bit it over. The

1961
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:52,660
Salakun. You guys all bit it over on the, uh, thing. Hey, I'm talking to you. Let me

1962
02:40:52,660 --> 02:40:55,160
Let me tell you something from keyboard mania. Something happy.

1963
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:56,660
No keyboard for you.

1964
02:40:58,660 --> 02:41:01,160
Amongst the full coffee in my boots!

1965
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:05,160
Okay, that kind of fits.

1966
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:11,160
Anyway, the guy was walking in the woods, and he was lost and lost and lost for days.

1967
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:18,660
So he chances upon this house, and he notices that there are telephone wires coming out of the house, so he knocks on the door.

1968
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:22,660
and this ancient old man answers the door.

1969
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:25,660
He goes, please sir, please, can I use your telephone?

1970
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:26,660
I'm lost in the woods.

1971
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:28,660
The guy goes, sure, you can use my telephone

1972
02:41:28,660 --> 02:41:30,660
and you can stay at my house, too,

1973
02:41:30,660 --> 02:41:31,660
until someone can come get you.

1974
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:34,660
But my one rule is that you cannot sleep with my daughter.

1975
02:41:34,660 --> 02:41:35,660
OK.

1976
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:38,660
So he goes in the house, uses the telephone,

1977
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:42,660
has dinner with the family, and the guy's daughter was really hot.

1978
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,660
He couldn't help it, she just weren't mad

1979
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:46,660
and played the tune of the table.

1980
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:53,660
So, late at night, the guy speaks out of his room and goes and, you know, has his way with her, and then goes to bed.

1981
02:41:53,660 --> 02:41:57,660
He wakes up in the morning with a gigantic rock on his chest.

1982
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,660
And there's a note attached to it.

1983
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:02,660
First greatest of all tortures, a gigantic rock stuck on your chest.

1984
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:04,660
Then he goes, well, shit.

1985
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:06,660
Throws it out the window.

1986
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:09,660
And then he feels a searing pain, and another note appears.

1987
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:13,660
Second greatest torture, right testicles tied to rock.

1988
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:18,660
So, the guy leaps out of the window after it. He finds another note.

1989
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:21,660
Third grade is torture. Left testicle tied to bedpost.

1990
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:23,660
The end.

1991
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:26,660
Ouch.

1992
02:42:26,660 --> 02:42:28,660
That was a nice joke.

1993
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:33,660
Being a girl, I don't think you can completely appreciate the pain that I just felt right there.

1994
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:35,660
What do you think, Matt?

1995
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:37,660
I don't care. I heard that one lightning.

1996
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:38,660
Fifth grade?

1997
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:41,660
Well, fuck you then.

1998
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:46,360
is there any another joke

1999
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:48,740
this guy was in jail

2000
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:51,700
he had been in jail for so long and hadn't gotten laid

2001
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:53,700
he hadn't even been anyone's bitch

2002
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:55,540
so he gets out of jail

2003
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:58,360
and they give him his suit of clothing and twenty bucks

2004
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:00,580
first thing he wants to do

2005
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:01,660
is get laid

2006
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:05,060
so he goes to a brothel

2007
02:43:05,060 --> 02:43:07,520
and he talks to the madam there and she's like well

2008
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,140
our women are at least a hundred and twenty and up

2009
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:13,700
He's like, do you have anyone that I can get for 20 bucks?

2010
02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:16,180
He's like, well, we can give you to Bertha.

2011
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:17,020
So he gives him Bertha.

2012
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:18,540
And Bertha's this woman with like one leg,

2013
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:21,300
she has a peg leg, she's missing one arm,

2014
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,660
and she's got a glass eye.

2015
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:26,500
So the guy is trying his hardest

2016
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:28,740
and he just can't get anything with Bertha.

2017
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:30,580
She's like, look, why don't we do this?

2018
02:43:30,580 --> 02:43:34,140
So she takes out her glass eye, says, try this one.

2019
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:37,260
So he goes out her eye, her eye socket,

2020
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:40,700
and it's been the best lay he ever had in his life.

2021
02:43:40,700 --> 02:43:44,400
And he tells us, like, you know, next time I need to get some, I'm coming to you.

2022
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:46,400
I, you know, you were the best ever.

2023
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:48,400
He's like, okay, honey, I'll keep an eye out for you.

2024
02:43:52,700 --> 02:43:53,700
Ha ha ha ha.

2025
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:55,400
Oh, dear good lord.

2026
02:43:55,400 --> 02:43:58,400
Okay, on that note, I think we're gonna take a quick break,

2027
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:00,400
and then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

2028
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:01,700
Sound good to you guys?

2029
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:03,200
Yes?

2030
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:04,400
We can wrap it up in ribbons and bows.

2031
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,600
Oh, you want booty music? I'm sorry.

2032
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:07,600
Well, I have this request, though, so I gotta play this first.

2033
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:09,500
All right, I'm gonna play this, then we'll do something booty.

2034
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:10,200
Okay, here we go.

2035
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:12,200
We'll be right back.

2036
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:42,200
Oh

2037
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:58,680
It's Mr. Spanky, as promised, I'm here on the air to give you some tips.

2038
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:03,000
Tonight I'm gonna read you a letter, because I don't know much about, well I do know a

2039
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:06,680
thing or two about it, I have to admit you guys, not that there's anything wrong with

2040
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:10,680
But today, we're going to be talking about fellatio tips.

2041
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:12,680
So I'm going to read a letter for you guys.

2042
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:15,680
You might need a translation of that, Mr. Spanky.

2043
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:18,680
I'm sorry? Oh, fellatio. That's a blowjob.

2044
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:19,680
Okay.

2045
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:21,680
Fellatio means a blowjob.

2046
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:23,680
All right.

2047
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:27,680
This letter comes to us from a girl named Emmy.

2048
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:28,680
She says,

2049
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:32,680
My husband and I have been married ten years, and during this time,

2050
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:35,680
my enjoyment for giving head has increased tremendously.

2051
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:39,680
I have found the more I turn him on, the more it turns me off.

2052
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:42,680
I'm sorry, the more it turns me on, I can't read today.

2053
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:49,680
I start off by teasing him a little, flicking the head with my tongue, and licking the underside slowly from bottom to top.

2054
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:55,680
I have also learned he likes me to deductively look at him while I'm doing this. It adds to the teasing.

2055
02:46:55,680 --> 02:47:03,680
One problem I had from taking his cock all the way, because I enjoy giving pleasure to him, so much I wanted to be able to deep throat.

2056
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:12,680
I could do it once in a while, but most of the time I would gag, so I thought that if I could just numb my throat somehow, I would stop gagging.

2057
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:18,680
That's when I figured it out. I bought some chloroceptic throat spray and put it in my nightstand.

2058
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:23,680
The next time I gave him head, I had no problem swallowing his entire cock.

2059
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:27,680
I can't tell you how turned on he was, and how turned on I was.

2060
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:33,680
You can also use children's teething cream, but it doesn't have a pleasant taste, and it's harder to apply.

2061
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:36,680
That's my tip. It works great for us.

2062
02:47:36,680 --> 02:47:43,680
There is nothing that you can do which more clearly shows your love for him than adoring his talk.

2063
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,680
Well, thank you! That was Mr. Spanky Sex Tip of the Week.

2064
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:52,680
You guys should look for me. I'm in DDR PC. I'm in a character expansion pack.

2065
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:56,680
Bye everybody! See you next time!

Swing that back, turn your back, and see where it's at

2072
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:55,020
Throw them all up, swing that back, turn your back, and see where it's at

2073
02:49:55,020 --> 02:49:59,020
Palm Beach, Peanut Butter, Dank County, Jell-A, Orlando

2074
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:02,020

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

2076

Man, shit, man, what time is it, dawg?

2077
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:18,020
I don't know what time it is, Reylo

2078
02:50:18,020 --> 02:50:20,020
Peanut butter jelly top!

2079

Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

Orange Lounge Radio.

2081
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:45,020
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

2082
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:48,420
And we're here to wrap up tonight's show, because we're just about at the end.

2083
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:50,220
We're going to wrap it up in cellophane.

2084
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:52,220
We're going to wrap it up in a nice little bow.

2085
02:50:52,220 --> 02:50:53,720
And sell it on eBay.

2086
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:56,220
And give it to somebody for Christmas.

2087
02:50:59,220 --> 02:51:02,020
So, anything else you guys want to talk about on the show tonight that we haven't gotten

2088
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:04,220
out yet?

2089
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:05,220
Bree South.

2090
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:06,420
I've mentioned it before.

2091
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:07,620
Funny show.

2092
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:08,820
Gotta love it.

2093
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:11,820
On MTV.

2094
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:13,820
Any more rants in you, Jamie?

2095
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:20,820

2096
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:22,520
i'm feeling restless now

2097
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:24,440
you're feeling restless so you just kinda

2098
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:34,080

2100
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:42,760
you can come with me, Jamie

2101
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:45,460
So what are you guys going to play, because everything there is Para-para?

2102
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:47,260
Para-para.

2103
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:50,580
Para-para. You know what this town needs? We need a Para-para team.

2104
02:51:50,580 --> 02:51:52,340
No.

2105
02:51:52,340 --> 02:51:53,740
Come on!

2106
02:51:53,740 --> 02:51:56,180
I am no Para-less. I know maybe

2107
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:59,780
six of them, and I only do four regularly. You know what pisses me off?

2108
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:03,020
And I'm pretty sure... No, this isn't just specific to Roseville Golf Land.

2109
02:52:03,020 --> 02:52:04,980
I know most golf lands have this problem.

2110
02:52:04,980 --> 02:52:07,520
The kids that tease people playing Para-para.

2111
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:11,860
I mean, fucking... I had one of them kicked out. God, I fucking hate those kids. I hate kids that

2112
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:15,340

2114
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:23,380

02:52:33,380 --> 02:52:37,860

2119
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:39,860
Uh, I'm just looking.

2120
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:44,860
And no, Orange Beanie, I'm not picking you up because you're in the other direction. Sorry.

2121
02:52:45,860 --> 02:52:46,860
Aw, I'm sorry.

2122
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:49,860
Oh, oh, oh, and don't forget, Initial D.

2123
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:50,860
Oh, Initial D is cool.

2124
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:51,860
Initial D.

2125
02:52:51,860 --> 02:52:56,860
But yeah, kids piss me off, and there's a lot of them at Golf Land, and they're all rich and snobby, and they think they're better than everyone else.

2126
02:52:56,860 --> 02:52:57,860
They suck.

2127
02:52:57,860 --> 02:52:58,860
They piss me off, they suck.

2128
02:52:58,860 --> 02:52:59,860
And they suck.

2129
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:00,860
They suck. No, they don't suck.

2130
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:02,860
No, because...

2131
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:03,860
They blow.

2132
02:53:03,860 --> 02:53:11,360
They don't suck, they don't blow. The fact that they exist is worse enough.

2133
02:53:11,360 --> 02:53:18,260
Oh God, I think I actually might have just created a pair of Parasax stars with my statement.

2134
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:19,940
My bad, my bad, sorry guys, my bad.

2135
02:53:19,940 --> 02:53:22,660
Oh, for the four that I know. Or for six that I know.

2136
02:53:22,660 --> 02:53:25,920
Yeah, I'll join for the three that I know. I'll join just so that we have a big group

2137
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:26,920
of people.

2138
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:27,920
You have to teach me like a virgin correctly.

2139
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:30,220
We need to do trick- okay, I'll teach you how to do like a virgin, that's fine.

2140
02:53:30,220 --> 02:53:31,220
And I'll teach you...

2141
02:53:31,220 --> 02:53:32,220
You can teach me the one you know that I know.

2142
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:33,220
Ashimatsu.

2143
02:53:33,220 --> 02:53:37,220
But you know what I need to brush up on? I need to brush up on Light of Fire.

2144
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:39,220
Okay. I need to remember how to do Eurobeat.

2145
02:53:39,220 --> 02:53:42,220
Yeah, teach me Eurobeat. Learn Eurobeat and then teach me.

2146
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:47,220
So I'll get you my Max 300 Para Para going here.

2147
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:49,220
No, I'll tell you what will be great about a Para team.

2148
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:51,220
The thing that I want to learn though is Osolemio.

2149
02:53:51,220 --> 02:53:57,220
For that one day that I do feel like playing Para Para, what we need to do, we need to trick the assholes.

2150
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:01,220
We'll just have everybody on the Para Para team sitting in the little booths and like one person up on the machine.

2151
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:04,340
on the machine, and then when somebody starts teasing them, just get everybody to get up

2152
02:54:04,340 --> 02:54:07,340
and surround them and just start glaring, and then like, para para in their face or

2153
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:08,340
something.

2154
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:09,340
Everyone get up there and mirror.

2155
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:10,340
That's right.

2156
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:11,340
Everyone get up there and mirror.

2157
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:12,340
Wow, that's so 80s.

2158
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:13,340
Kick kids in the butt.

2159
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:18,580
How about I just inject them with the AIDS virus?

2160
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:22,300
Try Drano, it kills them more painfully.

2161
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:25,060
Imagine being injected into something that starts eating at your insides.

2162
02:54:25,060 --> 02:54:26,660
Or you just inject somebody with air.

2163
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:30,320
Hey, I eat McDonald's too, okay?

2164
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:32,320
I don't. My point stays.

2165
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:35,320
Okay, so I think that we should just go.

2166
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:39,320
You think we're going to end this show now? You want to end this show now?

2167
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:41,320
Well, no. We have three minutes.

2168
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:44,320
We have enough time to do final thoughts. You guys want to give your final thoughts?

2169
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:46,320
Jamie, what is your final thought of today?

2170
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:49,320
That's it?

2171
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:53,320
Where's Brad? Get Brad back in here. He needs to do a final thought.

2172
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:58,600
My final thought is, I need more man porn.

2173
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:00,800
I need man sex.

2174
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:01,800
Thank you.

2175
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:02,800
You need man sex.

2176
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:03,800
Brad, do you have a final thought for me?

2177
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:07,640
I need man sex.

2178
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:08,640
Well now...

2179
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:10,120
And we have that on tape now.

2180
02:55:10,120 --> 02:55:11,120
Yes we do.

2181
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:13,760
Hey, I'm going to play that last week on Orange Launch Rio.

2182
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:15,240
I need man sex.

2183
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:18,320
Tune in every Sunday night.

2184
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:20,520
Hello to those people listening to us in Japan.

2185
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:25,000
I heard at our station to people listening in Japan, they were Orange Lounge fans.

2186
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:26,960
Orange Lounge the group, not the radio.

2187
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:27,960
So they're tricked.

2188
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:29,880
Haha, now we got you.

2189
02:55:29,880 --> 02:55:30,880
Yeah.

2190
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:31,880
We got you good.

2191
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:40,000
Well, I don't know, maybe we should offer them something a little bit different than

2192
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,720
just saying, haha, we tricked you.

2193
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:42,720
Okay, what?

2194
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:43,720
Say, arigato gozaimasu.

2195
02:55:43,720 --> 02:55:44,720
What's that mean?

2196
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,720
Thank you very much.

2197
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:46,720
Oh, okay.

2198
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:47,720
You should know what that means.

2199
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:48,720
No, I don't.

2200
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:49,720
I'm too white.

2201
02:55:49,720 --> 02:56:01,720
What are the Orange Lounge tracks for the rotation?

2202
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:06,720
What do the kids have to look forward to next week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2203
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:11,660
we're going to sacrifice low-key to the gods live on air

2204
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:15,540
hey low-key is a guy who have written their guide okay

2205
02:56:15,540 --> 02:56:18,700
but i think i played by jim carrey

2206
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:20,620

Oh, oh, oh, my half.com thing is going to arrive sometime next week.

2215
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:40,860
What's that?

2216
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:45,100
I ordered Sense and Sensibility on widescreen laserdiscs, so I can watch more Alan Rickman.

2217
02:56:45,100 --> 02:56:46,780
You're a hopeless case.

2218
02:56:46,780 --> 02:56:51,280
If you go to Jamie's friends page now, it is filled up with the Slytherin community,

2219
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:53,980
the Draco community, the Alan Rickman community.

2220
02:56:53,980 --> 02:56:59,040
Alright, I am on, I am on, I'm in the Alan Rickman community, the Slytherin community,

2221
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:04,020
the Professor Snape community, and I'm in the Animal Crossing community.

2222
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:35,420
was uh...

2223
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:38,380
i hate boys a place

2224
02:57:38,380 --> 02:57:42,100
well then we'll get you some pretty

2225
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:44,020
i'm confused tuna

2226
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:45,240
red bull there

2227
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:49,180
now i need to turn tables i have the microphone turn tables and a mac

2228
02:57:49,180 --> 02:57:52,300
following the case you know if it's not going

2229
02:57:52,300 --> 02:57:55,500
jimmy actually i let me see how close the other week or the other day and i

2230
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:57,500
was laughing at our shoes eating tacos

2231
02:57:57,500 --> 02:58:01,100
actually one of the action i got a second five controller now for the

2232
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:03,100
And it's a lot better than the other one.

2233
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:05,100
And I'm gonna...

2234
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:07,100
No, I have the old ASCII pad.

2235
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:09,100
It's the BeatCon or whatever that is.

2236
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:11,100
It's better than the other one.

2237
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:13,100
But I'm modding them.

2238
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:17,100
But they're all like that.

2239
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:19,100
They're all like that.

2240
02:58:19,100 --> 02:58:22,100
There's a one with piano keys which is somewhat decent.

2241
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:26,100
I have the official ASCII one which sucks ass.

2242
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:35,100
But I've been hearing that NCSX was dropping their 2DS controllers to 50 bucks. So I'm checking that out.

2243
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:42,100
Well I'm doing a mod on mine that actually I'm making a brand new mod for 5 key.

2244
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:46,100
I'm going to actually put ball bearings underneath the turntable to make it spin better.

2245
02:58:46,100 --> 02:58:51,100
Because it has room for it and they have these two really crappy plastic things that it spins on.

2246
02:58:51,100 --> 02:59:02,100
There's room for barbarians inside there, so we'll put that on there, and maybe a little rubber mat on top of it so that you have grip on the turntable, because their keys and everything is fine, but yeah, just the turntable sucks.

2247
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:04,100
Make me a 2DX controller.

2248
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:06,100
Should you?

2249
02:59:06,100 --> 02:59:07,100
No.

2250
02:59:07,100 --> 02:59:08,100
Okay.

2251
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:09,100
I'll pay you.

2252
02:59:09,100 --> 02:59:10,100
Maybe.

2253
02:59:10,100 --> 02:59:12,100
One more, one more thought.

2254
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:16,100
Which dysfunctional Sesame Street character are you?

2255
02:59:16,100 --> 02:59:19,100
I got Burton Ernie's gay relationship.

2256
02:59:19,100 --> 02:59:22,100
Surprisingly enough, I got Grover on E.

2257
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:25,660
I'm Grouch's heroin addiction.

2258
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:29,780
And what about you, Brad? I didn't participate in this

2259
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:33,940
dorky thing. What are you talking about? Then you're transsexual Elmo.

2260
02:59:33,940 --> 02:59:37,140
I have a thought, actually. I thought it was kind of weird how...

2261
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:40,940
Hey, Jamie. Yes, I can think. Anyway,

2262
02:59:40,940 --> 02:59:45,180
I thought it was kind of weird how Rob disappeared from our studio when Mr.

2263
02:59:45,180 --> 02:59:46,140
Spanky came in.

2264
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:52,140
And why did Mr. Spanky sound like he was related to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog?

2265
02:59:52,140 --> 02:59:58,140
That sexual tip was good for me to poop on.

2266
02:59:58,140 --> 02:59:59,140
I hate you.

2267
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:02,140
He was scaring me that he kept grabbing my ass.

2268
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:04,140
Mr. Spanky, that was.

2269
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:08,140
Oh, I thought he was talking about me. I guess he doesn't mind when I do it.

2270
03:00:08,140 --> 03:00:12,140
Alright, we're running over. We gotta go. Take care, you guys. Have a great night.

2271
03:00:12,140 --> 03:00:13,140
Yeah, we're running over the show.

03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:49,960
And now a buffoons meeting with the dean of admissions at a prestigious college.

2278
03:00:49,960 --> 03:00:54,840
Well Michael, I'd like to extend my warmest congratulations on your upcoming graduation

2279
03:00:54,840 --> 03:00:58,480
and I understand you're interested in matriculating here in the fall.

2280
03:00:58,480 --> 03:01:00,640
I got a snake, man!

2281
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:05,880
Yes, pets are welcome here on campus, be it the traditional dog or cat or even the occasional

2282
03:01:05,880 --> 03:01:06,880
reptile.

2283
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:14,880
One time I feted some beer, Mank! It was slivering this way and that! It was all fucked up!

2284
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:21,880
I'm sure it was. Well, we discourage inappropriate drinking among both students and pets here on campus.

2285
03:01:21,880 --> 03:01:23,880
Fuckin' shit!

2286
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:30,880
Yes, that's a not uncommon reaction to this policy. So tell me a little bit more about your background.

2287
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:33,880
My father's a fuckin' asshole, Mank!

2288
03:01:33,880 --> 03:01:38,880
Hmm, I see. Your feelings of rebellion are not unusual at your age, son.

2289
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:42,880
My mother's a piece of shit, too!

2290
03:01:42,880 --> 03:01:45,880
Well, I hope you can find an outlet for your hostility over the summer,

2291
03:01:45,880 --> 03:01:48,880
so you can come to school in the fall relaxed and ready to learn.

2292
03:01:48,880 --> 03:01:56,880
My teacher in high school was a stupid bitch, man! She had her head way up her ass!

2293
03:01:56,880 --> 03:02:02,880
Well, the quality of the faculty at a university such as ours far exceeds that of a local public high school.

2294
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:06,380
Your secretary's a real fat bitch, man!

2295
03:02:06,380 --> 03:02:10,380
Guess she's tried many diets over the years with minimal success.

2296
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:17,380
I had diarrhea last month! I had to shit all fucking day!

2297
03:02:17,380 --> 03:02:22,380
Uh-huh. Well, we all get the occasional stomach bug. Never a pleasurable experience.

2298
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:26,380
So, have you given any thought to your choice of major?

2299
03:02:26,380 --> 03:02:30,380
I've got a big fucking boner right now!

2300
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:36,380
Hmm, I see. Well, sexual arousal is not uncommon during periods of nervous tension. I do not take offense.

2301
03:02:37,380 --> 03:02:40,380
One time I ate my neighbor's shit!

2302
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:46,380
That's understandable. Well, I enjoyed meeting you, and we'll be sending you our decision by the end of the month.

2303
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:50,380
I bet you got really hairy balls!

2304
03:02:51,380 --> 03:02:54,380
Yes, it's a veritable force down there. Bye-bye!

2305
03:02:54,380 --> 03:03:00,220
Bye-bye.
