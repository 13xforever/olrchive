00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
message for you sir!

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey, is any balls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
About the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
The show's absolutely frightening.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I don't get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
But no kung-fu.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
No!

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
What I expect for Spanish exposition is gentle.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, hey, hey!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Dark Sakura.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Shut up!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Where's my gun?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
This is my boom stick.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Sky.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Loki.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I can't believe it.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind of work human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
We are live, and this is episode number 25 for December the 22nd of 2002.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most old school station.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
That's judging by the preshow, correct?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
of all things...

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
BEEEEEEEEEEEEE

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Freak.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
My name is Rob Roberts and you might-

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
His name is Freaky!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You might know me as Sky.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Joining me as always are the other two pieces of the pie.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Say hello to the, um,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
the apple pie in that corner, Jamie.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
The funny pie.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Apple?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I don't know, what pie would you be?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Mincemeat!

We're very low on the listeners and people in the chat room and all that stuff.

09:28.940 --> 09:31.940

10:33.140 --> 10:36.140
how we're going to start this big show off. We want to do the FUs of the Week. We want

10:36.140 --> 10:40.700
to do the Sim updates. We can talk about anything that's in this Maxim magazine because... Why

10:40.700 --> 10:45.660
don't we talk about Loki's Christmas present from Jamie? Let's talk about that. I gave

10:45.660 --> 10:52.660
him the gift of cleavage. I got a Maxim magazine and I got a bunch of chocolate. A whole bunch

10:52.660 --> 10:57.180
chocolate like tons and tons and tons and tons of chocolate but no nuts no

10:57.180 --> 11:03.860
nuts because I hate nuts but um I'm a good present giver because I remember

11:03.860 --> 11:08.460
but this this book is awesome I mean it's got well other than the fact that

11:08.460 --> 11:12.820
it's got this really cool page of this topless cheerleader that's just oh my

11:12.820 --> 11:18.580
god that's what I want next year okay right there

11:18.580 --> 11:23.580
Let's see, it tells they have a page here how to amputate your own limb.

11:23.580 --> 11:24.580
How?

11:24.580 --> 11:30.580
How to date a cheerleader, how to make a tridocan or whatever that is, I don't know.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.580
How to play craps.

11:32.580 --> 11:33.580
It's just awesome.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.580
How to deck your lawn.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.580
Crazy stuff like that.

11:37.580 --> 11:41.580
Speaking of Maxim Magazine, don't you have an announcement to make about your little competition?

11:41.580 --> 11:51.580
Oh yeah, due to the fact that our wonderful message board went down again, I am postponing the due date by two weeks.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.580
For what?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.580
For Make Edit Get Porn.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.580
The winner is you.

11:58.580 --> 12:02.580
Why don't you explain one more thing, even though no one new is listening tonight, I'm sure because our listener counts so low.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.580
Tell us all about Make Edit Get Porn.

12:04.580 --> 12:09.580
Make Edit Get Porn is basically you make an edit for any song that's on DDR Max USA

12:09.580 --> 12:18.580
and you send it to me some way, either it be a Dex Drive save, a DWI file, a step chart, whatever

12:18.580 --> 12:24.580
you just send it to me and you're entered, the winner gets a big box of porn.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.580
That's pretty much it.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.580
So basically, you make an edit and you get some porn.

12:30.580 --> 12:31.580
Maybe.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.580
But you have to win to get the porn.

12:33.580 --> 12:44.580
to get the porn. As things look great now, there's like two people entered. Another thing

12:44.580 --> 12:50.900
that prompted me to push back the deadline by two weeks. So that's pretty much the contest

12:50.900 --> 12:59.100
right there as it stands. VidPower has a suggestion. He says it shouldn't be Murp make edit receive

12:59.100 --> 13:03.940
Because then he can say merp.

13:03.940 --> 13:06.740
Why do we have to drop everything down to acronyms?

13:06.740 --> 13:10.780
Eff you to acronyms, okay?

13:10.780 --> 13:19.420
Anyways, so, yeah, I mean, futa.

13:19.420 --> 13:24.060
Ooh, page 100.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.460
The acronym show, you mean TAS?

13:26.460 --> 13:29.460
Dude, they have nude elves in here.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.460
Dude? What?

13:30.460 --> 13:32.460
Wait, what is this?

13:32.460 --> 13:34.460
Why are there... I don't...

13:34.460 --> 13:35.460
Okay.

13:35.460 --> 13:36.460
That's pretty cool.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.460
Maxim Magazine is such a dirty little rag.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.460
I love it.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.460
Surprise.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.460
Ah.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.460
Yeah.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.460
Let's go stretch.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
Yeah, they have stuff about video games.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.460
What's the video game that they reviewed this week?

13:53.460 --> 13:54.460
Nightfire.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.500
They gave it a four out of five stars.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.200
James Bond, it's uh...

13:59.200 --> 14:02.860
Yeah, it's like GoldenEye.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.900
Okay, you want to fuss? Jamie wants to fuss. I want to fuss.

14:05.900 --> 14:10.060
Jamie wants to fuss. I think I'm using... Fuss about something. Are we doing FUs already? This isn't the FUs or is this...

14:10.060 --> 14:14.780
This isn't an FU, but I need fussy music. Do you need fussy music? Whoa, look, balls!

14:14.780 --> 14:19.780
This guy is holding bread together to where it looks like balls and that big...cock.

14:19.780 --> 14:23.780
What fussy music do you want? You want your normal F.U. music?

14:23.780 --> 14:27.780
What's your fussy music?

14:27.780 --> 14:31.780
You want gravity for your fussy music?

14:31.780 --> 14:35.780
Let's see if I can find fussy music.

14:35.780 --> 14:39.780
Fussy, fussy, fussy.

14:39.780 --> 14:43.780
Okay. What the hell?

14:43.780 --> 14:47.780
She's a hoe. Okay, here we go. I have your fussy music.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.780
She likes being beaten when she has sex.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.780
Okay. Today we went to Roosevelt Golf Lamp.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.780
And boy did it suck.

14:58.780 --> 15:01.780
We went over there to play some Para Para and stuff.

15:02.780 --> 15:06.780
And I just got so sick of all the machines being down that I went and fussed the manager.

15:07.780 --> 15:08.780
His name?

15:09.780 --> 15:10.780
With a list and all.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.780
No, I made the list after I fussed with him.

15:13.780 --> 15:18.660
well you can do it again. His name was Chris. He's a tall guy.

15:18.660 --> 15:24.860
He's a tall guy. And he was wearing a vest over one of those button up goth land shirts.

15:24.860 --> 15:31.300
I went and I fussed at him.

15:31.300 --> 15:35.260
I said

15:35.260 --> 15:38.980
Excuse me, I'm trying to fuss.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.540
I asked why the machines were in forward hair.

15:42.540 --> 15:45.780
And I named off machines one by one, and what was wrong with him?

15:45.780 --> 15:48.620
And his eyes just got a little bit wider, and a little bit wider.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.720
And he decides to use, um, this condescending corporate talk.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.960
Okay, I worked for a corporation for two years, and I'm working for another one now.

15:55.960 --> 16:01.080
Although that's not quite as professional as today.

16:01.080 --> 16:05.360
Anyway, um, and he's like, well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.660
And blah blah blah, and the tech comes in on Monday. I'm like,

16:08.660 --> 16:15.660
I remember hearing that they have three techs at Willysville.

16:17.040 --> 16:24.040
They must have three techs, but they all come in the same day and just drink beer and watch football.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.740
I was like, well then hire another.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.080
And he's like, well corporate deals blah blah blah.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.480
If all of your funding comes from your corporate office...

16:37.480 --> 16:39.480
How corporate to suck your corporate cock?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.480
I don't have a...anyway...

16:41.480 --> 16:44.480
Eat your corporate clit then, I don't care!

16:44.480 --> 16:53.480
Anyway, I was like, well then explain why I haven't noticed this many machines down at SVGL.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.480
Or I haven't seen this many machines down at MGL.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
Or CVGL!

16:58.480 --> 17:02.480
I started naming off places, and I'm like...

17:02.480 --> 17:06.240
He's like, you know, if all your funding comes from

17:06.240 --> 17:09.360
Gotham corporate, why are these other goth lands

17:09.360 --> 17:13.200
in such good repair and this one has so many broken machines?

17:13.200 --> 17:17.440
And he's like, um, well, I don't know. I'm like, you know what? I'm like, if we don't see some

17:17.440 --> 17:21.440
improvement here, there might be an organized boycott of your facility.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.880
Hell no! It won't go!

17:24.880 --> 17:28.240
Oh yeah, but I probably wouldn't go anyways. And I walked off, took out my notebook,

17:28.240 --> 17:31.840
and proceeded to write down all of the machines that were broken.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.840
So I have a list, but I'll leave my list after Rob says he's okay.

17:35.840 --> 17:40.840
I have a silly comment, but if Black Lab used to work for the golf line, correct? The Golf Line Empire.

17:40.840 --> 17:45.840
I was just wondering what your manager would have done had Jamie came in and said lick my corporate clit.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.840
Okay, first of all, my-

17:48.840 --> 17:49.840
First of all-

17:49.840 --> 17:51.840
I wouldn't have said that.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.840
Well, first of all, my manager was more of a woman, so.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.840
Yeah, that would have just made the situation all the more awkward.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
I didn't press anything, it was nice.

18:02.840 --> 18:09.840
Yeah, but a constructed cart you made for my manager would have actually produced some kind of result.

18:09.840 --> 18:16.840
I mean, but, then again, Captain Valley is like, a fifth the size of Roseville.

18:16.840 --> 18:26.840
If you, I mean, you guys, there's only two golf courses, and like, no water slides or golf carts like there are in Roseville, but anyway.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.840
Okay, what are you looking at now in this back so far?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
Oh my god, it's Rapture!

18:31.840 --> 18:34.840
I know about these.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.840
Okay, time to... I think she's kind of fussing about...

18:37.840 --> 18:40.840
Dude, you just turned red.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.840
Okay, cuz.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.840
Yeah, Rob's complaining about things already going on a train wreck.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
This is what's broken right now at Roseville Golf Land.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.840
By the way, they have really crappy surface today.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.840
Anyway, um, hip hop...

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
What's new? Today?

18:55.840 --> 18:58.840
This is... these are just the obviously broken things.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.840
Okay, I didn't go by and personally test every game.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.840
First of all, the hip hop mania, it eats tokens.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.840
I lost two dollars in tokens on that thing today.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
Did you get that?

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
They wouldn't give it to me.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.840
You're mean.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.840
Okay, guitar breaks was down.

19:16.840 --> 19:22.840
Drum mania was put out of order because the drumsticks weren't tied to the machine, but I just took the sticker off and just played it anyway.

19:22.840 --> 19:28.840
DDR 4th mix was down, however they were turning it on when we were leaving. I think someone just reached right there close to me.

19:28.840 --> 19:36.840
Um, uh, DDR match to, um, you said the left player up arrow was broken and the right player right arrow was broken?

19:36.840 --> 19:37.840
Other way around.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.840
Oh, uh, first player left, first player up arrow, and second player...

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
That's, that's what I'm saying.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.840
Um, and Pada Pada has one of the sensors on him a little bit loose.

19:47.840 --> 19:54.840
For the medieval madness, pinball is down. Roadshow pinball is down.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.840
Revenge of Mars pinball is down. Time Crisis Player 1 is down.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.840
The grid was down. They had it, but I'll take it apart.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.840
They had, like, separated, like, one group, one in each of the corners.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.840
Radical Bikers is down.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.840
Radical Bikers? That's the only game that's not worth getting into your DL.

20:11.840 --> 20:12.840
I'm just naming all of them.

20:12.840 --> 20:13.840
It is, like, it never works.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.840
That game War, the third player was down.

20:16.840 --> 20:30.520
So how many games is this that I've named, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

20:30.520 --> 20:40.920
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

20:40.920 --> 20:49.920
So how many games is this that I've named? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 games!

20:49.920 --> 20:54.920
I'd like to announce also that their ticket counting machine is inaccurate.

20:54.920 --> 21:00.920
It in fact counts less tickets than you put in there, no matter what you do, because the retards don't empty it.

21:02.920 --> 21:07.920
You sound like the comic book guy. I would like to point out that that ticket machine is inaccurate.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.020
worst episode ever

21:11.020 --> 21:14.040
don't like this

21:14.040 --> 21:18.120
possibly yeah no no we roll any other

21:18.120 --> 21:21.280
any other worse episode ever was me doing it live from

21:21.280 --> 21:24.880
freaking the tournament now

21:24.880 --> 21:28.400
and stuff and

21:28.400 --> 21:32.400
I'm closing down

21:32.400 --> 21:52.000
Oh, a plan. P-L-A-N. That's not an acronym. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie has a plan.

21:52.000 --> 22:06.000
No, we need the fanfare from Marky and Bullseye.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
The plan is this, we've tried petitioning them before, you know, sending letters.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
We only sent in a few letters, so this is what I'm going to say.

22:15.000 --> 22:27.000
Okay, for everybody who has a complaint regarding Roosevelt-Goughlin, you know, there's supposed to be power in numbers. I'm going to send a letter to Goughlin corporate.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
To complain about the shoddy performance of Roosevelt-Goughlin. I'm going to send it to Steve Boss.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
Yes, Steve Rogers was going to say, who is the general manager of Rizzo Gotham.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Also, you know, the fact that he was so unresponsive here and the whole time we're trying to get our tournament running,

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm sending a letter to the Gotham Incorporate, questioning about him.

22:52.000 --> 23:04.000
I thought something would be shaken up, because I heard that Shiggle Boss went out there and checked the place out earlier, like last week sometime.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
There needs to be more than just that. Even wanting to enlist the aid of anyone with a digital camera, go take a picture of each.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Nearly 7 out of 10 women say that they're unhappy because they're the lowest.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Loki shot for a minute.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
On Jamie's point, last time we did that, took a digital camera and took pictures and we put them up on the internet, they were pissed.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
They were so pissed. Let's do it again, let's do it again.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Let's do it!

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
And you know, we had a thread on that open on DDR3 for six weeks?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
With links to those pictures?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Can I be in the picture with a sad face?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Yes!

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
And you know what?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
We should photoshop Captain Jack into a picture and have him crying.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
You know what?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Am I not incorrect that it worked last time?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Yes it did.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
We had our keyboards replaced on keyboard media.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Yes it did.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So you know what? Let's do it!

23:59.000 --> 24:22.000
Let's do it! Let's go ahead and, uh, you know, there's something, I don't know if anyone has ever worked in customer service or any type of service where they've given training classes like that, but, um, for every eight displeased customers, only one person ever does nothing about it.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
That's sad.

24:23.000 --> 24:30.000
And the thing about this, each of the people that are just in the service are going to go and tell another eight people at least and spread the word.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
I would just like to point out that I used Jamie's example in a training class the other day at work.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You did? That's cool.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
But, see, that's the point.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
You need to think that for every single complaint letter you get, there are seven other people who are pissed off at your company.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
You know?

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
You see what we're going to do? We're going to make sure there's quite a few more than just eight.

24:52.000 --> 25:03.000
And to point out, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, we're an international show, we got listeners in Japan, listeners in Canada, all over, you know, our world headquarters, Sacramento, California, so this is kind of a local topic.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
But, you know, even the people, we got some folks in Vegas in the chat room right now, VidPower says, I feel sorry for you guys, an arcade should not be messed up that bad.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
Yes, we bitch about RVGL because we want your pity. That's the point of this whole thing.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
On top of that, though, we're making a point for anybody else, you know, around the world country.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
If you see your arcade or any place too frequent that's in poor condition, do something about it.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Just say, oh god, this sucks, and not doing anything about it.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
People don't know what they're doing wrong until you tell them.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Just keep in mind that the vast majority of people in this world are fundamentally stupid.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm not saying everybody is stupid.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
I'm not saying everybody is stupid because obviously our listeners have a brain.

25:45.000 --> 25:58.000
But, you know, there are a lot of really dumb people in the world, and they just don't get it, and they keep doing something, thinking that they're doing something the right way, and in the meantime, they don't know just how bad they're fucking up.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Especially if your arcade smells like pee.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That would be laser force.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
I swear, I smelled fish while I was playing DDR at Roseville today.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Me too, I smelled fish. I was like, dang, somebody needs to douche.

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
It was nasty. It distracted me when I was trying to play.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
It was sick. Golf Land is filled with the ragged smell of pussy and I don't like it.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
At least no little kid came and took a dump by you while you were playing.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
You didn't have to see someone trying to change your baby's diaper on the keyboard.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I have a little horror story about colorful heaven.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Uh-oh!

26:40.000 --> 26:46.400
Yeah, when I was working at Castle Gas in CVGL over the summer, some little kid, I think

26:46.400 --> 26:53.640
it was around Labor Day weekend, they were trying to fix the air conditioning on the

26:53.640 --> 26:58.840
roof and all of a sudden I walk over to the edge of the roof to check around to see if

26:58.840 --> 27:03.560
there were little kids running around, and I see this little brown pile sitting on the

27:03.560 --> 27:10.360
sidewalk out in front of the arcade, I'm like, that can't be from a dog or something, can

27:10.360 --> 27:16.800
it? And then I get a complaint from my boss, he's like, Ryan, the toilet's clogged, could

27:16.800 --> 27:21.800
you go take care of that? So I go walking over to the bathroom, I look at the toilet,

27:21.800 --> 27:25.840
and there's a little kid's pair of boxers filled with crap sitting in the toilet. There's

27:25.840 --> 27:30.080
like a half a roll of toilet paper crammed in there with, like somebody trying to flush

27:30.080 --> 27:36.080
the boxers down the toilet how stupid can you get no i had to and then i walked outside

27:36.080 --> 27:41.120
and followed there was like little trails of drops of crap laying on the sidewalk up

27:41.120 --> 27:45.680
to this big pile over by the over by one of the starts of the golf courses i had to clean

27:45.680 --> 27:53.520
that up it was nasty i don't think i need any more chocolate tonight thank you well

27:53.520 --> 27:56.520
Maybe they won't keep you aside for this. That's a good thing.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.520
Okay, Santa's getting some.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.520
We're looking in the...

28:02.520 --> 28:05.520
That damn Maxim again!

28:05.520 --> 28:08.520
I'm going to read the quote.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.520
And here's a candy cane for you.

28:11.520 --> 28:16.520
It's a picture of Santa and some woman on his lap with her underwear.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.520
It's just like a shot of somebody... Santa sitting from these down.

28:20.520 --> 28:24.520
Let's hear it for Maximus.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.520
Anyway, back to what my point was, if anybody,

28:28.520 --> 28:32.520
it doesn't even matter what it is, people don't know what they're doing wrong until you point it out to them.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.520
Make sure that if you're going to complain about something,

28:36.520 --> 28:40.520
you do it in a constructive manner. You point out item by item what is wrong

28:40.520 --> 28:44.520
with what they're doing, how you think it can be fixed, and then you send it to the people

28:44.520 --> 28:48.520
who can do something about it. Don't give it to some peon because they're going to lose it.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.520
Which means go over everyone's heads until you get to the top.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.520
Go as far as you need to go.

28:55.520 --> 28:58.520
That's been my lesson for the day.

28:58.520 --> 29:03.520
So that's what we're going to do. We're going to a coffee coffin.

29:03.520 --> 29:07.520
Okay, there's another article in this back.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.520
Is this the Maxim show now?

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
Yeah.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.520
Loki will give you a little quote from it.

29:14.520 --> 29:23.520
They're talking about like Santa's new album, The Hoe Zone, and it claims it was the single, first single, Get in the Sleigh, Bitch.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
Yeah, anyways.

29:27.520 --> 29:31.520
And that gets the, okay, whatever word I want. It'll be a week. Anyway.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.520
I think now's a good time to go to break. What do you think?

29:35.520 --> 29:36.520
Um, I can break.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.520
Okay, we're gonna go break stuff.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.520
I wanna go break something.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.520
Okay, we'll be right back and we're going to play something else from the 8-Style Center.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.520
I'm going to play a song I like.

29:47.520 --> 29:51.520
I can cue that one up. I have that right here.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.520
And I'm going to play a song I like, too, called Monkey Dancer.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.520
I like that song. That song rules.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.520
Monkey Dance.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.520
Sorry, not Monkey Dancer, Monkey Dance.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.520
Alright, so we'll be back in a little bit. Thanks for listening.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.520
It's true that I

32:31.520 --> 32:33.520
Maybe go into party or fight

32:33.520 --> 32:35.520
Then I catch a mist

32:35.520 --> 32:37.520
Show me your magic

32:37.520 --> 32:39.520
Under the moonlight

32:39.520 --> 32:41.520
Bounds of light

32:41.520 --> 32:43.520
A bloody veto

32:43.520 --> 32:45.520
Love of me, I don't know why

32:45.520 --> 32:47.520
Do you understand?

32:47.520 --> 32:49.520
This move to the tail

32:49.520 --> 32:51.520
The bird is watching me

32:51.520 --> 32:55.520
Monkey dance, monkey dance

32:55.520 --> 32:57.520
Like a star

32:57.520 --> 33:00.520
Move your booty dance, move your booty dance

33:00.520 --> 33:05.520
Let's dance together, on the fire, baby

33:05.520 --> 33:09.520
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me hear

33:09.520 --> 33:12.520
Move your booty dance, move your booty dance

33:12.520 --> 33:18.520
You can't stand still, the truth will rise from you tonight

35:12.520 --> 35:14.520
Oh

37:12.520 --> 37:30.840
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.440
Hello, my friends.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.960
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and in that set, we heard a bunch of 8-style

37:35.960 --> 37:36.960
songs.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.640
Guideca was that last song we heard.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.800
Before that, Xeno On.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.280
Before that, Monkey Dance and Startin' That Sit Off.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.360
I'm sure it's on this Jamie's favorite, Sakura!

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
Cool.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.760
So, um, I don't know if you guys heard the news, but I remember last week we were talking

37:51.760 --> 37:55.680
about DDR Extreme and the rumor that it was coming out on Christmas Day, and I said, what

37:55.680 --> 37:56.680
a bunch of bullshit!

37:56.680 --> 37:58.680
Ah, you were wrong!

37:58.680 --> 37:59.680
Whoops!

37:59.680 --> 38:05.240
My bad, it is coming out on Christmas Day, according to the Konami official website.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.720
So, okay.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.720
Okay.

38:09.720 --> 38:15.720
Alright, so I thought we'd talk a little bit about DDR Extreme and what kind of stuff we should expect to be seeing in it.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.720
What we're looking forward to and all that stuff.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.720
What have you heard, Loki? Have you heard anything on it?

38:20.720 --> 38:22.720
Oh, hey, we've got another special guest in the studio.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.720
Hey, we've got some special people joining us right now.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.720
Oh, this is cool, very cool.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.720
Hello, my friends. Pick up a microphone, grab a mic.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.720
Hello.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.720
Hello.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.720
How are you?

38:34.720 --> 38:35.720
I am good.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.720
Hi Amanda, say hello to Amanda.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
Hi, I'm Amanda.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.720
And this is Yana, say hello.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.720
Hello.

38:40.720 --> 38:41.720
And they've come to visit us.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.720
Now Amanda, you're a big DDR fan, right?

38:44.720 --> 38:45.720
I guess so.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.720
Do you still even play anymore?

38:47.720 --> 38:51.720
Um, I think the last time I played, actually wait, did we?

38:51.720 --> 38:54.720
I played once, like that's the last time I came over here.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.720
I went and played like once at QsR and a fourth.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.720
Well, where did you used to play?

38:57.720 --> 39:01.720
Tell us about some of the folks that you used to play DDR with and when you got started

39:01.720 --> 39:02.720
and all that.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.720
We started off at Mountain Mike's, because that was the only machine in the area.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.720
That's when I really, really started it.

39:08.720 --> 39:12.720
The machine got really crappy, so we stopped playing.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.720
Then we got a seventh mix, so everyone was there.

39:16.720 --> 39:21.720
And then our work schedule got busy, so I stopped.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.720
What is this you showing? Shame on you.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.720
They're not, no.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.720
I know. They're perfectly legal. I've seen those things before.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.720
They're just natural cigarettes.

39:31.720 --> 39:32.720
What does it say?

39:32.720 --> 39:33.720
Let's see.

39:33.720 --> 39:34.720
It's just a brand name.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.720
Can I say over the air what these are?

39:35.720 --> 39:36.720
It's yeah.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.720
They're ecstasy cigarettes.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.720
It's just a brand name.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.720
It's just having to do with the chemical.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.720
It doesn't have anything to do with going to the rave.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.720
No, it has nothing to do with MDMA, no.

39:46.720 --> 39:47.720
Let's see.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.720
Let's read the ingredients.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.720
Damiano, wild lettuce, catnip.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.720
Dude, catnip.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
Let's go smoke some catnip.

39:56.720 --> 40:00.720
And passion flower, mint, love and light.

40:00.720 --> 40:08.880
I used to work at J&C for two years.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.360
Damiana makes you horny.

40:11.360 --> 40:17.160
Very very very horny.

40:17.160 --> 40:21.560
We used to sell it to old men who couldn't get it up.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.920
Herbal Viagra.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.760
In hell.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.040
So yeah.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.760
You do realize you've walked in on a DDR talk show, correct?

40:31.760 --> 40:32.760
Yes.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.280
Why do I have the greatest idea?

40:34.280 --> 40:37.360
Oh, oh, oh, whenever I have the bowling alley, they have the really crappy third mix.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.360
Uh-huh.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.920
My friend who works there pretty much got on the guy and says, look, you know what?

40:41.920 --> 40:43.760
The reason this machine isn't making money is because it's crap.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.760
You don't give it up.

40:44.760 --> 40:45.760
And basically, she just basically told it like it was.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.760
There's a seventh mix there now.

40:46.760 --> 40:53.240
Pretty much the bowlers, before, were complaining about everyone stomping on it and interfering

40:53.240 --> 40:54.240
with their game.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.240
Right.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.240
And now, because its pads work, you don't have to stomp as hard.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.240
The thing that they're complaining about mostly is the music now, so they just kind of turn it down, but it's still playable.

41:02.240 --> 41:15.240
It's funny that you mention that, because in the last segment, Jamie was just talking about Roseville Golf Land, how a lot of their games have gone to shit, and how she was going to write a boycott letter to the management, the high, high, high management, like corporate.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.240
Nice.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.240
God.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.240
Yes, god of golf lands, so it's funny that you bring that up.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.240
Dear Shicklepot.

41:23.240 --> 41:31.240
So, wow! So, uh, what else is going on? I don't know. What's new in the world of Amanda that she can talk about on the radio?

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
Um...

41:33.240 --> 41:36.240
Did you meet Ryan in the front room? That's Black Lab. I don't know.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.240
He's online, dude.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.240
Is that the one who answered the door?

41:39.240 --> 41:40.240
Yeah, probably.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.240
He's kind of looking at me weird like, uh...

41:43.240 --> 41:44.240
Who the hell are you?

41:45.240 --> 41:48.240
He's like looking at us like, what the hell are you doing?

41:48.240 --> 41:50.240

42:04.240 --> 42:10.920

42:10.920 --> 42:14.600
know what might be fun? Why don't you guys, why don't you guys play match game with us?

42:14.600 --> 42:18.640

43:54.960 --> 43:58.660

43:58.660 --> 44:00.480

44:00.480 --> 44:03.500
that's right a breeze

44:03.500 --> 44:07.240
okay wait a minute you're asking if a max a magazine belongs to me

44:07.240 --> 44:11.040
hello i know we don't talk about this fact much on the show

44:11.040 --> 44:12.800
That's not my preferred reading material.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.200
Got it?

44:15.200 --> 44:20.320
I actually have a friend who has it as well.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.320
And then he basically, let's just put it this way.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.040
He got himself a subscription to XY.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.960
And for his birthday, his dad got a subscription to Playboy.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.800
Just so happened that one day they both came in the mailbox

44:31.800 --> 44:32.640
on the same day.

44:35.600 --> 44:39.160
Wacky, crazy, wild stuff.

44:39.160 --> 44:43.440
I think we're getting a phone call, is this, I don't know, we're not getting a phone call,

44:43.440 --> 44:47.040
but our friend here in the house is getting a phone call.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.760
I don't know what's going on.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.000
I've lost total and absolute control of this show.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.480
Hey, Amanda, did you hear there's a new DDR coming out, DDR Extreme on Christmas Day in

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
Japan?

44:56.480 --> 44:58.840
You have this total unenthused look on your face.

44:58.840 --> 45:01.080
You can't actually play the game right now, huh?

45:01.080 --> 45:05.600
Well they'll have it here in about a couple weeks, I'm sure they'll get the game in Japan.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.600
It's got butterfly on it!

45:06.600 --> 45:07.600
So now we can all dance like house lighters.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
And have these fleekies.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.600
Apple.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.600
Holla bowl.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.600
This show's gone.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
We're all nuts right about now.

45:12.600 --> 45:25.600
I have nuts and some of us don't.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.120
Yeah, I know nuts aren't your preferred...

45:28.120 --> 45:33.600
Well you know like men are like a box of chocolates, you never know which one has nuts.

45:33.600 --> 45:43.160
What is the match game?

45:43.160 --> 45:44.160
What is the match game?

45:44.160 --> 45:45.480
I want to do a match game, but we have to have our own.

45:45.480 --> 45:49.120
Dude, it's got pictures of those guys pulling a truck with their cocks.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.120
What?

45:50.120 --> 45:51.120
What?

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
What?

45:52.120 --> 45:53.120
Ah!

45:53.120 --> 46:02.720

You better known as the guy that was in Rushmore and also was in that other movie that I didn't like.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.080
Two movies I probably haven't seen.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.080
Uh oh, we have family issues, don't we?

46:48.080 --> 46:50.080
I just got shit.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.080
Okay, so, I gotta get back to the chair here.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.080
Let me catch Black Lab up on where we've been.

47:01.080 --> 47:06.080
Black Lab, while you were out playing 2DX, we had some, uh, from the official Lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.080
Hahahaha!

47:07.080 --> 47:10.080
Amanda and Yana came into the house, so I'm getting the finger right now.

47:10.080 --> 47:14.080
And the, uh, and I bet you'll be getting the finger later! Hahaha!

47:14.080 --> 47:16.080
Hahahaha!

47:16.080 --> 47:19.080
Actually, I think Damien's gonna be home today, so...

47:19.080 --> 47:22.080
You know, if it wasn't actually for that finger, he'd still be a virgin.

47:28.080 --> 47:31.080
Yeah, I just walked into the room and I'm like,

47:31.080 --> 47:34.080
OK!

47:34.080 --> 47:36.080
He's so cute, he's blushy!

47:36.080 --> 47:39.080
I'm just trying not to laugh so hard right now.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.080
Plus the sugar's kicking in.

47:42.080 --> 47:47.080
I don't know how many of you guys have heard about the vibrator, the Hello Kitty vibrator?

47:47.080 --> 47:48.080
Chocolate?

47:48.080 --> 47:51.580
Wait, do you want to talk to us about the Hello Kitty vibrator?

47:51.580 --> 47:56.580
Oh my god, it's like if you're doing it with a vibrator, you know, it's like you know somebody's

47:56.580 --> 47:58.580
actually having sex with the Hello Kitty vibrator.

47:58.580 --> 48:03.080
So I said it and they're like, oh, Hello Kitty!

48:03.080 --> 48:05.080
I mean, come on now.

48:05.080 --> 48:08.580
I mean, it's obvious anybody's going to have a Hello Kitty vibrator unless they scream

48:08.580 --> 48:11.080
out the name Hello Kitty.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.480
I wanted to go to San Francisco to get one.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.380
That's just sickening, okay?

48:16.680 --> 48:20.480
I don't know if that's the chocolate, if it was that or the chocolate that's about to make you puke, I don't know.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.280
Whether it got used or not, it would just be a thing that would be cool to have.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.480
Just put it on display, that's all you need it for.

48:27.080 --> 48:27.880
I don't know, man.

48:27.880 --> 48:31.680
These, uh, these, like, religious dildos look pretty funny.

48:32.280 --> 48:39.080
You got the little Buddha, Buddha with, like, testicles for some reason, and then the, the, you know, crucifix dildo.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.280
Oh yeah.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.380

48:53.320 --> 48:55.440

49:08.020 --> 49:09.620
that we're going to be playing

49:09.620 --> 49:16.620
is from CKY. It's a Chinese freestyle rap.

49:19.340 --> 49:22.980
So it's pretty sweet.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.980
You guys love it.

49:24.980 --> 49:27.780
Where is it? It's right there. Right? Okay.

Alright, here we go. We're going to do this. The CKY Chinese freestyle rap.

49:30.900 --> 49:34.340
And in the meantime, we need some contestants for Match Game, because we're going to do that right when we get back.

49:34.340 --> 49:38.620
But first we need a trivia question. You want to offer up a trivia question for the chatters, Jamie?

49:38.620 --> 49:42.500
How are we going to get people?

49:42.500 --> 49:45.520
We've got to make it kind of simple, but not too hard.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.980
Something simple, but not too hard? Something not too easy.

49:49.980 --> 49:51.800
Okay, what was...

49:51.800 --> 49:53.360
Alright, here we go.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.960
Alright, V from BeatMania2DX, what was the original song and who composed it?

49:56.960 --> 50:02.000
Ah, okay, so V from 2DX, who was the original composer and the name of the original song?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.040
Yes. Yes, okay.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.720
So just message that to me in the chat room. And you get bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.

50:06.720 --> 50:16.720
Yes, bonus points if you name the symphony it's from. So, first two people to get in on that will be playing match game with all of us, all six of us in house right now. So, we'll be right back.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.740
And if you want a little mint, that's fifty cents

51:45.740 --> 51:47.740
Bitch, every day costs a little bit

51:47.740 --> 51:49.740
So don't expect nothing for free, at least for me

51:49.740 --> 51:52.740
Take Chang Chui, I got you from Taiwan City

51:52.740 --> 51:55.740
And Hong Kong, I can smoke a bottle can, I can do it all night long

51:55.740 --> 51:58.020

51:58.020 --> 52:00.220

52:00.220 --> 52:02.340
Never see me where I get you and make you

52:02.340 --> 52:04.860
Rope you up, and put you in a bamboo cage

52:04.860 --> 52:06.460
And make you feel all my rage

52:06.460 --> 52:08.300
Poke you with a little stick till you stage

52:08.300 --> 52:10.220
Your buddies too come nape on me

52:10.220 --> 52:12.940
Goddamn the chips burnt, blew away my whole city

52:12.940 --> 52:15.500
Oh, chief man, shoot a load on your chips

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
Goddamn that's a dick, always go goodbye

52:17.500 --> 52:19.020
And if you wanna cop on in

52:19.020 --> 52:21.420
You can work into my world where the yellow ship begins

52:21.420 --> 52:23.340
Oh my god, can't be changed

52:23.340 --> 52:25.660
I got chips to control your brain and it's called

52:25.660 --> 52:27.660
Egg, coal, y'all, and lo me

52:27.660 --> 52:30.660
So come on in, baby, and have it just the same, all right?

52:30.660 --> 52:31.660
Ha!

52:37.660 --> 52:40.660
Knowing I'm down, aren't they, Dave?

52:40.660 --> 52:42.660
Ha, I don't suppose.

52:42.660 --> 52:43.660
Ha, ha, ha.

52:43.660 --> 52:44.660
Huh?

52:44.660 --> 52:46.660
Huh, huh, huh.

52:46.660 --> 52:47.660
Oh, shit.

52:51.660 --> 52:52.660
Oh, hi, we have dead air.

52:52.660 --> 52:54.660
Hold on, I have to bring us back with a promo, though.

52:54.660 --> 52:58.660
with a promo though. Okay we'll play one more song then we'll come back. How about this is a promo?

52:58.660 --> 53:04.100
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or die! Okay welcome back! We've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

53:06.260 --> 53:12.020
And we have our two contestants for um it's so dead in our chat room tonight. I don't know what's

53:12.020 --> 53:18.500
going on. If you want to join our chat room just go to our website orangelounge.skie.cx and join

53:18.500 --> 53:22.660
our chat room. It's really dead tonight. Only about half our regulars are here but you know I

53:22.660 --> 53:25.660
Everybody's off-filling the Christmas spirit.

53:52.660 --> 53:58.820
a couple weeks. That's good. I think you, right? Maybe not, maybe, maybe not? I discussed

53:58.820 --> 54:03.140
this with her. It's a two hour drive each way, so that'd be a total of eight hours driving

54:03.140 --> 54:07.540
on my part. We'll work something out, we'll figure something out. We'll figure something

54:07.540 --> 54:13.740
out. We'll work it out somehow. But one eight hour drive we're going to be making, you and

54:13.740 --> 54:18.460
me low-key this weekend, we're going to SoCal. We're going to SoCal! And we're going to hopefully

54:18.460 --> 54:21.940
meet some of our regulars down there and get some interviews, because SoCal Kicks is foaming

54:21.940 --> 54:26.120
to get the mouth wanting to get on the show, so we gotta go interview him at some point.

54:26.120 --> 54:30.180
So Jamie, unfortunately, I have a cry because she has to work, she's not going to be able

54:30.180 --> 54:31.180
to make it, so...

54:31.180 --> 54:33.180
I'm going to be marathoning on to me.

54:33.180 --> 54:34.380
Well that's cool.

54:34.380 --> 54:38.460
And you never know, during the middle of whatever we have planned, somebody's cable might start

54:38.460 --> 54:39.460
working again.

54:39.460 --> 54:40.460
That's right, and...

54:40.460 --> 54:43.820
You know, that goes back to the fuck yous of the week.

54:43.820 --> 54:46.940
If you enjoy the fuck off shows that's happened here in the past, guess what, it's about to

54:46.940 --> 54:48.940
get twice as big.

54:48.940 --> 54:51.100
Again, depending on the cable.

54:51.100 --> 54:55.500
The fucks are going to get twice as big from Jamie because you know how angsty she can

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
be.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
Okay, alright.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
Here we go.

54:58.500 --> 55:01.500
We're going to play some DDR match game.

55:01.500 --> 55:02.500
DDR.

55:02.500 --> 55:07.980
So, we have our contestants, who does our contestants say?

55:07.980 --> 55:14.020
Our contestants today are Vidpawa from Vegas, who I'm very impressed he got the bonus question

55:14.020 --> 55:16.020
too.

55:16.020 --> 55:21.020
And nobody else got the answer to the question, which by the way, what was the answer?

55:21.020 --> 55:25.020
The answer was Vivaldi Winter from the Four Seasons.

55:51.020 --> 55:54.940
Oh, here it is.

55:54.940 --> 56:00.940
We have to explain for our new folks in the studio how to play this game because I don't think they've played a match game before.

56:00.940 --> 56:03.980
Basically we've got phrases.

56:03.980 --> 56:07.500
And on these phrases we have a blank on these phrases.

56:07.500 --> 56:08.900
Basically it's like

56:08.900 --> 56:11.940
I went to the mall and bought a blank.

56:11.940 --> 56:16.940
Dildo! Hello Kitty vibrator!

56:16.940 --> 56:19.700
You don't buy those at the mall.

56:19.700 --> 56:21.700
You and I don't go to the same mall.

56:21.700 --> 56:23.700
Unless you're in Vegas.

56:23.700 --> 56:25.700
They have ones that glow in the dark. Like, you really want to see the inside.

56:25.700 --> 56:31.700
Dude, I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to buy hair dye, and they had these things called hand massagers.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.700
They look like vibrators.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.700
It's like those little figure massagers you've seen infomercials before.

56:38.700 --> 56:40.700
No, no, this one was dildo-ly.

56:40.700 --> 56:41.700
Hand massager with dildo attachment.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.700
And they were selling them for $3 at Sally's Beauty Supply.

56:44.700 --> 56:46.700
I'm gonna make you holla!

56:46.700 --> 56:53.500
Okay, yeah, it's time to start.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.620
So we got our two contestants.

56:54.620 --> 56:58.580
Now contestants, when you have an answer to fill in the blank with, you're going to message

56:58.580 --> 57:02.180

57:02.180 --> 57:03.180

Alright, those are our lovely celebrities today.

58:44.960 --> 58:50.960
I just had an idea. I think we should have, like, a little counter or something for every time there's a reference to the porn.

58:50.960 --> 58:54.960
You can, like, talk up the counter and we'll see what the highest number is by the end of the show.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.960
Like, you can start doing that with the next live show.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.960
The porn counter.

58:59.960 --> 59:03.140
Like that is so South Park really

Can I do the first question now, here we go. All right, here's the first question for our folks in the chat room

59:13.420 --> 59:15.420
the first question is

59:16.620 --> 59:22.660
Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars

59:22.660 --> 59:27.280
but he was really sad that when he picked love to me that everyone called

59:27.280 --> 59:35.560
him a blank. Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a

59:35.560 --> 59:39.940
big crowd of the DDR regulars, but he was really sad that when he picked love to

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:20.680

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.680
But everyone was really sad that when he picked love to me that everyone called him A.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.680
Let's go to the contestants.

Vidpawa says old school freak. Everyone called him an old school freak.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.680
That's too G rated. I don't know. We'll see.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.680
SoCalKick says everyone called him an idiot.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.680
Idiot. Alright, that's a little harsher.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.680
That's more on our page.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
Let's see if they get any matches.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680
We have idiot and old school freak.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680
Let's see, here we go.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.680
Jamie, everyone called him a...

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680
Dildo.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680
Dildo!

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.680
Oh, eh, sorry, that is not a match.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.680
Loki, everyone called him a...

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680
Cocksmoker!

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.680
I'm sorry, that is not a match.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:41.680
Black Lab! I said, Ass Hat! Ass Hat! Everyone called him an Ass Hat. No, I'm sorry, Ass Hat is not a match.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:51.680
Amanda? I was like really drawn for a blank, so all I said was dork. Dork is a good answer, but not a match. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, contestants, not a match.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.600
Yana said everyone called him a...

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.760
Fag!

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.560
A fag!

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.720
Everyone called him a fag, beautiful. And I said

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.840
that when he picked love to me that everyone called him a fag. I also put fag.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.600
We have an in-house match!

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.320
So, um, but unfortunately it didn't match what the contestants put. But that would have been the answer.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.000
That would have put you in the lead if you'd guessed fag, but unfortunately you did not.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.820
so that is a

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.920
that is not a match i don't know if it's an answer of the last

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.360
i think it did

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.560
so you're putting bag is is usually pretty good pretty good way to get

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.520
points all right

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.520

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.560

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:55.480

to find out the site went down.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:17.620
hardcore triple x lesbian emi prawn

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.800
ah so we have porn and prawn

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.500
all right beautiful

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:30.020
i'm sorry can you repeat that one?

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.500
if it was a seafood buffet i bet you wouldn't have a problem with it

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.580
all right here we go

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.700
let's check with the stars

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.700
It's a gimme! He decided to go and download some Plank.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.700
Yowie hentai Pokemon fanart.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.700
Yowie hentai Pokemon fanart. That was almost what I put, but I changed my answer, I have to say.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700
I almost put that.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700
Loki, your answer, please.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.700
Well, it's a gimme, come on.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.700
Porn, it's like... Do you need an excuse?

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.700
He went to go download some porn. Alright, is that a match? What do you think, Loki?

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:06.700
No, it's not, because they were frickin' stupid and specific, so damn good.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:11.380
just say I'm sorry that half a point each for each of them all right half a

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:19.420
point each one flaccid point needs all right half a point so you get a full

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.060
point to distribute amongst you guys so you each have half a point dscs says

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:29.340
now he's disputing because he said he said porn you said hidden camera DDR pad

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:35.900
porn Loki did you say hidden camera DDR pad porn no camera so orange shit that's

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.900
That's not porn. You get half a point. Deal with it.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.900
I think as far as Loki's concerned, if it fucks it works.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.900
Alright, Black Lab, your answer, please.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:49.900
I just went with something that I knew they wouldn't say, so I just said R.O.B.S.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.900
You said what?

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.900
I said R.O.B.S.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.900
Oh, R.O.B.S. I thought you said R.O.B.S. I'm like, what?

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.900
I have a website.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:04.900
Sky.com?

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.900
I didn't know I had a website.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.900
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I'm bringing out the Mr. Spanky voice. My bad.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.900
All right. It's all tied up. Half a point each.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.900
Amanda, what did you put?

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.900
I originally put porn, and I started saying, no, that's too general.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.900
I just feel a little more specific, so I said barnyard porn.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.900
Barnyard porn!

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.900
Word. Wonderful answer, unfortunately. Not a match.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.900
Yana, what did he go download? He downloaded some...

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.900
Midget porno.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:37.540
porno I'm sorry that is also not a match although I don't I don't know cuz you

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:41.100
know a lot of Asian people are pretty short and if you're doing the upskirt

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:48.340
camp I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm gonna get I'm gonna get smacked all right all right

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.420
my answer as I said I was trying to match Jamie but unfortunately I didn't

01:06:52.420 --> 01:07:01.620
he decided to go download some Harry Potter yaoi okay I don't I don't mind

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:08.620
There are some things that I will not stand for to me, and this is something about ten-year-old boys.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.620
No, I knew you weren't really going to put that, but I was hoping our contestants would.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:17.620
Dude, you should have said, download naked pictures of Alan Rickman. I mean, come on.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.620
That would have been, like, a definite match.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:26.620
But I thought that, like, most Galleys, like, they look like they're ten years old as it is, the way they're drawn.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.620
There are no naked pictures of Alan Rickman, also.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.620
I'm getting smacked by the chat room for the short comment, by the way.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.620
All these people that are Asian are hitting me.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.620
I'm getting stabbed in the kneecaps. Help.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.620
I'll stab them with the carrot.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.620
Alright.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.620
Alright, I'm just kidding you guys. Jesus.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.620
Alright, here we go.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:53.620
Next question. So it's tied up at half a point each. One flaccid point between them.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.620
Our two contestants. So can I take some Vidpow at them?

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.620
Here's the next question. I think this is the next to last.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.620
No, there is five questions. My apologies. There's five. This is the third question.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.620
Dana the DDR-er was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:13.620
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said,

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.620
Wow! Everyone here looks like a blank.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.620
Dana the DDR-er was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.620
She walked through the door of the arcade, looked around and said,

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.620
wow, everyone here looks like a blank.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:57.460
Okay, I have mine.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.460
I don't know, Jamie, what do you think? I think it's funny.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:05.460
Go for it. Okay, go for it.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:09.460
This is going to get really wrong. All right, here we go.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.460
Do we have both of our contestants locked in? Are we all ready? Are we all ready in the house?

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.460
Oh, Black Lab is still working. Well, let's see if the contestants are locked in. Let's see.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.460
Okay, this is going to be interesting.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:25.460
How many people are we going to offend with this segment? How many people are we about to

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.460
everybody locked in?

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.460
black lab is still working, he's slow, that's alright

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.460
he's the brat summers of the show, she was always the last one to lock in

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.460
by the way, the reason to have the game show network is for a 70's match game

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.460
oh, you're in?

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:48.460
no, the reason to have the game show network is press your luck, hello

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.460
word, word

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.460
the whammy owns me when it sucks

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:58.940
Alright, here we go. The question is, Dana the DDR was really excited to be going to

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.020
her first DDR tournament. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:10.740
said, wow, everyone here looks like a, VidPower says, fag. DSCS SoCalKick says, wow, everyone

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:17.020
here looks like a fag. They both put the same thing, they both put fag. Let's see if they're

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.540
going to get any matches on this. Jamie walked through the door and said, wow, everyone here

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:27.220
looks like a poo-flinging monkey because they're playing Para Para. A poo-flinging

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:34.220
monkey! No, I'm sorry, that is not the answer. Loki! She walked through the door to the tournament,

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.460
looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a... I have to apologize ahead

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.500
of time for the comment that I'm going to make to fill in the blank. I do not mean to

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.320
defend anybody, but the way it came out, the first thing it came to my head, okay, and

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.160
I'm not racist or anything like that.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.160
Alright, alright.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.440
Wow, everyone here looks like a Sweaty Jack.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:02.320
Yeah, Sweaty Jack, that's what I said.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.320
Sorry.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.040
Oh my.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.600
Not a match, unfortunately.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.680
Not a match.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.040
I try to be orange, like orange lamp.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.480
uh... boy policy now you can smack low-key you can address those cards and

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.660

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.120

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.360
i have been around and said wow everyone here looks like uh...

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.960

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.280
i mean i think that's the best i could come up with his own i had something

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.920
else in mind but i

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.560
a sweaty big alright so a little a little more a g_-rated and uh... and uh...

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:49.560
friendly to all our... all our friends. Amanda. Dana the DDRter was really excited to be going

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:53.420
to her first DDR tournament. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:58.420
said, wow, everyone here looks like a... Once again, I have to apologize for this. I've

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:04.420
been out of the team for a while, but I had to take them home. A while ago. A split wannabe.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.420
Wow, everyone here...

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.420
Which, you know...

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.420
I say give him half a point, Eve, for that comment.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.420
That was good.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.420
Is the other thing...

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.420
Amanda gets a zing! That's one zing!

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420
Yes! A zing!

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.420
And actually, the other thing, I always think he was going to say,

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:28.420
that everyone was a tool.

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.420
Because he says that so much.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:35.420
I've got a lot of laughter in the chat room, what can you say?

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.420
All right.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.420
I feel like they deserve half a point each for their answer.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.420
So we're going to up them to one.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.420
Okay, one full point a piece.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.420
They've got one full point a piece.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.420
Beautiful.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.420
Zing cat.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.420
Yana.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.420
Wow, everyone here looks like a?

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.420
Hairy penis with crabs.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.420
A hairy penis with crabs?

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.420
That was lovely.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.420
I tried.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.420
I mean, actually...

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.420
No.

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.420
No, I haven't.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.420
It's like a penis with, like, a fro or something, you know?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.420
Oh, my God.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:23.420
answer. I have a furball in my mouth. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:31.760
around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a fag. I did put fag. So they get two

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:40.540
points each. The two of three out of Ross' answers are very gay. Well, you know. Alright,

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:45.160
here we go. Two more questions left here on Orantan's Mask Game. I lied, there's actually

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.160
So they each have two points, not bad.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
Better than last time.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.160
They've matched half a time each.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.160
I can't believe you came in that half point. I know we're going to get hate mail off that one.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.160
And Amanda got a zing.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.160
Alright, your next question.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.160
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal this next weekend.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.160
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:22.160
Lokee and Skye took a trip to SoCal. They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.160
I have mine already.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:34.160
What's the first stop?

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.160
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be Blaine.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:55.160
One of our contestants has absolutely no idea how to answer this question.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.760
question

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.120
low-key and sky took a trip to socal next week and they decided that their first

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:10.220
stop definitely had to be blank. It doesn't have to be a specific place.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.200
We have both our contestants locked in. Are all of our studio celebrities locked in?

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.240
One of our studio celebrities ran away from this show. That's kind of scary.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:20.740
What?

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.540
He'll be back in a sec.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.040
Okay.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:22.540
How about you guys?

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.240
You guys locked in?

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:23.740
Ready?

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.240
Oh, you're debating on an answer.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.440
Ooh, he's back in!

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.040
Oh, he's got the Raybar stick.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.240
Is he the one who came back to get someone?

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.240
Dude, you've got a Raybar stick.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.540
No, wave it around and change the color.

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.040
Woo!

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:36.640
That's cool.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.340
That's pretty.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.840
Wait, wait, turn off the light, Yana.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.540
Turn off the light.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.040
Turn off the light.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.440
Here we go.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:41.940
Here we go.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.240
Oh, dude, yeah!

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.140
Dude, I want one too.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140
Yeah, I want one, too.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640
That's pretty rad.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.140
Amazing seizure.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.640
Amazing seizure action.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.140
Okay, let's turn the light back on.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.640

01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640
Yes, here we go.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.140
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:05.140
Their first stop definitely had to be...

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.640

Surprise, shock of socks.

uh... i kind of favorite what they did it

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.460
but for all the reasons other than

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.420
all while

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.380
doing that is a match

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.420
that's it

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:31.420
that he had servers that we get a drug enough maybe

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.180
uh... if you're going to fight over female strippers

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:41.980
that if you get a straight now

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.420
says low-key we do

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:48.380
alright so that's a match 3 to 2 all of it powers upset but there's no chance

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.020
to match the power don't be too upset

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:55.060

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.980
International House of Gay Porn

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.940
IHGP

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.780
I don't know if you've ever seen this in West Hollywood, there's a gay superstore and it

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:19.940
says GAY SUPERSTORE in big print and under that, parking and rear.

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:22.660
Where every gay man's dream is.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:29.380
Alright, Yana, Sky and Loki went to SoCal Kicks, their first stop had to be...

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.500
The Dildo Factory.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:37.500
The Dildo Factory!

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.780
Oh, I'm sorry, what? None of them hear what?

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:50.780
We said once to SoCal, you said SoCal kicks.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.500
Whatever, I'm going to crack today.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.580
okay so yeah i'm sorry that's not a match the dildo factory wallet brilliant

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.180
answer is not a match

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.060
my answer was

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.140
i was i was thinking along very similar lines as somebody else here in the

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.900
studio that our first stop definitely had to be i put a gas station because

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.260
yes we're gonna have to pay

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.980
this is an eight hour drive

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.220
unfortunately not a match so so cal kicks is ahead by a score of three to

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.340
two

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.740
so vidpower vidpower is going to need this next one

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.740
This is it. This is it. This is the last question.

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.740
You need to match on this, okay?

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.740
Here we go.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.740
Here we go.

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.740
Here we go. Here we go.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.740
We're talking this Jamie right here in the house.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.740
Yeah, screw them.

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:50.740
She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-worker some day.

01:19:55.740 --> 01:20:00.740
decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.740
Okay, you want to tell that story about the Light FM?

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:26.740
My work, my boss, and I like the people I work with, but they listen to the light FM all day.

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:39.740
Like, they play Celine Dion all day, and Richard Marx, and Brian Adams.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:45.740
And they don't play the good Brian Adams songs. They played Heaven once, that was cool, but they don't play any of the other good songs.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.620
which really has one other good song which is number 69

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.560
what about that

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.460
uh... the one from robin hood

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:55.820
they play that all day

01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:00.820
that plays sucks all of us celebrities watch him

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:05.260
and then there's the people outside our office that play loud rap

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.220
like modern rap not like

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:09.420
is there a good idea to get through

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.940
no

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.440
I love this quote here, I'm reading Happy Noodle Boy, and it says,

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.940
I'm going to fly into your butt, prepare all asses for vicious entry.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:28.940
Next week, on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.940
I've got a sound clip of Loki.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.940
I, I, I handed him my Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.940
I can just see it now, the replacing, since the, um,

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:43.940
For the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me, I'm just kinda lost with them.

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:52.940
By the way, speaking of Johnny the homicidal maniac, um, we're still taking, I think, auditions for, uh, the, uh, zombie day.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:55.940
I think, I don't know, officials in the chat room, let us know.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:00.940
Um, but send in your, your sound clip auditions to, uh, to, uh, me.

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.940
Alright. Cool!

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.940
And they can reach you through the show email address.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:04.940
Yes.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.940
If they need to. orangelaunchradio.com.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:07.940
Yes.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:08.940
Alright, here we go.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.940
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day. She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:23.940
VidPower dedicates its answer to EOSVB and says, I'm going to say Propel. If it's a Propel in a radio, that would probably blow up the radio.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.940
That would tear up my radio.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.940
Zokowkik says he's going to put some yaoi moaning CDs in her radio.

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.940
Moan.

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:37.940
No, we're not putting in the gravitation soundtrack.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:42.940
Alright Jamie, best way to get some revenge on the co-workers, you're going to put some...

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.940
Korean booty music.

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.940
Korean booty music in the radio.

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:46.940
Which I have done before.

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.940
I'm sorry, not a match. Good answer.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.940
Well, that's because I've done it.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.940
Oh yeah, okay. Very good answer.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.940
The only answer, really.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.940
All the others are just one of these.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.940
Okay Loki, she decided to put some plank in her radio.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.780
okay i was going to say yurvi koka but that doesn't make any sense so

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:14.020
bagpipe music bagpipe music i've done that before too

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:19.140
brilliant but not a match black lab she's gonna put some

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:24.340
i said the bad tack music the bad tack music

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:29.140
i there's no there's things exactly i have played

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.900
tack by the way my ultimate tak cd in the office before so far

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:37.060
there's been internal matches pretty good there's going to be the uh 12

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:40.340
minute version of stoic

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.340
i'd rather listen to albert kirk even listen to

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:52.900
listen to a 12-minute stoic all right okay amanda what is she gonna put in a

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.780
radio i just understood the question that's okay

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.340
that's okay amanda we forgive you anyway what does she put in a radio

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:07.340
I'm thinking this is more of a way of destruction than anything.

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.340
Oh, okay. Well, Jamie's pretty destructive.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.340
So, um, cherry bomb juice and vanilla sauce and vanilla coke.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:17.340
You own, thank you.

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:21.340
That's very close to propel, but unfortunately not close enough.

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.340
It's my second happy crack.

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:28.340
I'm just thinking you put it in the radio and that way it kind of short circuses and blows up.

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:56.660
It was pretty frightening, the songs actually were like, there was this one about them talking

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:00.660
And it was this weird country type song and it was just strange.

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.660
It was like Dolly Parton's there too. It was scary.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660
Okay, well, Yana, it's your turn.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.660
Oh crap. Alright, Yana.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.660
You need to stop quoting that in the middle of nowhere like that.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:17.660
Anyway, the Hamster Dance speed version.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.660
No, they used to have that on their site where you could actually speed up the music and it played twice as fast.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.660
And it was, like, god awful.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:02.940
in a radio actually actually there has been voluntary coming out of my radio

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:12.460
yeah because it was on my fifth so unfortunately not a match which means by

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:19.860
a score of three to two so Cal kicks is the winner so a wiener is you this is

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:26.860
less. Congratulations. Yay, you! Vidpowah, good effort. Congrats, you! You know what,

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.300
two points I believe is better than anyone did last week. That's true! So that's something

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:38.460
to be proud of. Now, no, 23magus I believe got a point at the end and I was a big liar

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.160
and I said his prize would be he'd get his name in lights on the website and that never

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.060
happened because I'm lazy. So we'll think of, we'll probably do them both. We'll send

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:51.860
them a cookie. Maybe we'll send him a special Orange Lounge present. And since we're going

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.940
to SoCal next week and we could very well be bumping into SoCalCakes, we'll give SoCalCakes

01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.580
a nice little Orange Lounge present too. We'll give him an orange. Yes. I'm sorry, Black

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:09.420
Eye? I think he wants something else. 23rd Magus is very sad that I never put his name

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.500
in lights the whole time. We'll give him a cookie. We'll give him a cookie, so shut up.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500
These are better.

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.580
Bloody fuck monkeys, refuse my request of love.

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.100
Here's this blood feud ends, grand pappy.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.500
Grand pappy rub my feet.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.300
Me feet's grand pappy.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.380
On that note, I believe it is a very good time to go to a break.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.980
Yes, we have the wit and lore of Happy Noodle Boy.

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.980
That's one of our longest statements ever.

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980
Shit.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.820
We'll be right back after some...

01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.820
More trainwreck.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.820
More trainwreck.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.820
Let's uh...

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:43.820
We'll play this one to start off this break. Enjoy. We'll be right back in a little bit.

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:12.820
Have a mouthful here, same old country rhyme

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.820
And the words have been repeated

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.820
Well I love

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.820
Where would you be now?

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:26.820
Well I love

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.820
When the snow is from this roof

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.820
Down along this ramp

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.820
So I know that the best thing is

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.820
For me coming back

01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.820
I'm coming back with my love

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.820
Where would you be right now?

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:49.820
With my love

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.820
If the music never came to the base I'm forming it

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.820
Forming it, forming it, forming it, forming it

01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.820
And now DJ Listz starts rocking it

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.820
Rocking it, rocking it, rocking it, rocking it

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.820
I'll be with my love

01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.820
Where would you be right now?

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.820
Tears, they're running in the hyper

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.820
I'm gonna run and see what's on the mic, yeah

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.820
Let it go, everybody move along

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.820
Move along, move along

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.820
Well, again, I'm all essential

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.820
And the sound will sense the breeze

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.820
The dimples push in my mind

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.820
Cause I know they're robbing me

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820
Of my love

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820
Where would you be right now?

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.820
Not at night now

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:17.980
I forget that that's the bad MP3 and I can't play that one, so we're gonna go to the next

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.980
song right away here.

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.220
We're gonna play some stuff from Poppin' Music Mickey.

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.220
This shit rules.

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:24.220
Enjoy.

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.220
What?

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.220
What, Logie?

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:31.220
And there's also a song off the Nintendo 64 version of Disney's radio.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.220
Cool.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:07.220
If we weren't in the show starting right away we'd be in the audience too.

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.220
In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.220
In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:19.220
All the birds sing words and the flowers prune in the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.220
The bird of paradise is an elegant bird

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.220
It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:39.220
Most little birdies will fly away

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:42.220
But the Tiki Tiki Birds are here every day

01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:45.020
In the ticky, tricky, tricky, tricky room

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:48.100
In the ticky, tricky, tricky, tricky room

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.940
All the birds sing words and the flowers groom

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.940
But d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d Farnham

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.940
A fine musician, fun and dancing are the first requisition

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.940
Music in the key, a piece in harmony

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.940
The world all together and that's the way it has to be

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.940
Moving to the beat, there were shoes on the street

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940
100,000 lots of funky things to go through

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.940
Singing in the house, who looks up house?

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.940
A window and a mickey and you see what it's about

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.940
I, I make it

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.940
I'm busting and rolling

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:45.940
I, I make it

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940
I'll show you about the way it feels

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.940
I, I, I make it

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:52.980
Oh, too, I want you to play me

01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:58.700
I, I, make it home, home, home

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.380
Yeah, the Disney prop is coming at ya

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.380
Head him off at the park, homie

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:05.180
Uh, I mean, homie?

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.060
Yeah!

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.220
Now anyone can tell you when you're looking for fun

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.620
He's the mouse with the monkeys, he's the only one

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.940
But you're supposed to be cool, standing by, what's the last?

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.580
You see, only nice to do it, so you can leave your head up in

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.580
I, I, make it home

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:44.580
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.580
You're so bad.

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:55.580
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580
Welcome to our nightmare.

01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:00.580
Now you said you had an impersonation you wanted to do for us.

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.580
Yes, Yana?

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.580
Oh, yes. It's Mickey Mouse having sex.

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.580
Oh, oh, oh, Minnie!

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.580
Pluto, what you doing down there?

01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:10.580
Oh, oh, don't stop now.

01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.580
Ha, ha, ha.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:19.580
Oh, keep going Pluto! Act like it's a hot dog! Oh yeah! Lick that mustard right off, baby!

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.580
Oh yeah! Oh, hi Minnie!

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:27.580
I'm not cheating on you!

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:30.580
OrangeLunchRadio, how low can you go? How low?

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.580
So low!

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580
That was cool.

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.580
It was an error, why?

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:44.580
I'm dismayed. We need to do our Fuck Yous of the Week.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.580
We're going to do our Fuck Yous of the Week?

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580
Yeah.

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:53.580
Okay, well then let me close up all the windows so I can get folks to send me their F Yous of the Week.

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:58.580
You want to send those on over to me over private message, or you can send them to our email at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.580
But before the Fuck Yous of the Week, maybe we ought to, because I need a little time to get the music queued up,

01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:03.580
maybe now is a good time to do the Sim Update?

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:04.580
Sim Update.

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:06.580
Sim Update.

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:18.580
Okay. Um, let's see. Big news this week, of course, is that Turning Mix 3, it's, uh, all the files are up to download. Oh, wait, you can't because the server's clogged. Sorry. Ah.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:26.580
So, now they're all up to download, but you're one of the lucky ones that's able to actually get through and you can download over a hundred different DWIs.

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:36.580
They ended up having, like I said, 100 entries come in for heavy, so they bumped down 70 of those down to standard, I guess.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:51.580
Really don't understand the point of it because, I mean, they say it's because of the fact that they only wanted 30 in heavy, but I think they're just putting the names of people that they actually recognize in there and bumping down everyone else.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.580
Uh, did you make the cut?

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.580
No, I got bumped down.

01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:55.580
Don't!

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:59.580
It doesn't matter at all because no one can play any of the files right now, so hah.

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:04.580
Bitter, table for one, bitter.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:12.580
And, big news on my site, LeechFromLoki.com, or.tk is going to become one of the largest sim file sites ever.

01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.580
Ever.

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:20.580
Ever. I got, um, DDR Alama from DDR Maniacs has given me unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth to do with whatever I want.

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:36.580
So now, you will be able to find LeechFromLoki.tk at the new address, which is not yet up, but it will be www.WillDDRForFood.com, or.net, slash LeechFromLoki.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:40.580
I'm sorry, did I hear that right? WillDDRForFood.com?.net.

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.580
.net.

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:48.580
And I will have everything. I've got, right now in my collection, I have 1,800 sim files, so all those will be going up.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:51.580
And then, of course, the tourney mix stuff and whatever else I can throw up there.

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:52.580
Evary thing.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:59.580
Evary thing, yes. Everything that's going to be fixed. I have to fix everything to make sure it's all working correctly.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:06.580
But, yeah, so I have to do a complete redesign of the site, and that might take a while, so, you know.

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:16.580
In the meantime, well, there is a few updates on my site, but I haven't really linked those to the main page yet, so you won't see them, unless I've told you so.

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.580
Oh well.

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:27.580
Other than just the simp file stuff, not too much going on other than Turning Mix 3.

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.580
That's pretty much the big thing.

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.580
Of course, I already mentioned earlier in the show, but if anyone that just joined us

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:43.580
may get in and get warned, it's getting pushed back to two weeks from now because of our site going down.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:47.580
23rd Magus would like to know if we can do a live step file review at some point.

01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:56.580
That's a good idea. I can't set it up tonight because I don't have the resources, because what happens is if I load the emulator on this computer, the show crashes.

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.580
Or we get a lot of drops. We get a lot, a lot of drops, so I can't do it.

01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:05.580
But what we can do is one night we'll get my roommate to log into his system, and we can do a set file review on his computer.

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.580
Maybe we'll review... We'll do our own take on some of the TourneyMix 3 entries. What do you think?

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:15.580
Alright, here's the funny thing. Some people are getting pissed off that they can't download their own files.

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:19.580
So they're putting their files up on DNR maniacs to download for other people.

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:25.580
Well, unfortunately, stupid people out there, that disqualifies you. Ha ha.

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:33.580
So, you get to try the nice sim files out there, but they're going to be disqualified for all you to post them.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:38.580
They will be up all this week, so maybe try back later this week.

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:45.580
Another thing is DDRPC. We were expecting a new character pack, but unfortunately there's not.

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:49.580
Which makes me think that's going to be a Christmas themed one that will be released on Christmas.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.580
So, look for that.

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.580
Aw, how cute.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.580
It's going to be Bondage Santa.

01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:57.580
Mr. Spanky needs a partner!

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:03.580
Okay, so Amanda's on the phone, and is that it for some updates?

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.580
That's it, I think.

01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:05.580
Okay.

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.580
We need a Miss Spanky.

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.580
If we're going to have a Mr. Spanky, we need a Miss Spanky.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580
Have you guys ever seen Mr. Spanky, the DDR character?

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.580
There's a new DDR character named Mr. Spanky.

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.580
I know you've been out on the scene for a little while, Amanda.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.580
But, okay, Amanda's going, what the hell are you talking about?

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.580
Okay, hold on, let me load it up.

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.580
I'm going to be bondage-able.

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:23.580
Bondable on the, with leather straps.

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.580
Yeah, it's for a PC version.

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:36.580
PC version of DDR that Konami Hawaii put out, and they say that they have downloadable characters, but nobody plays enough characters.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:42.580
Oh, I thought they've rearranged the page a little bit. I thought they did. No, I guess not.

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:48.580
I thought there were only one more set to download. Anyway, there's Mr. Spanky right there, Amanda.

01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:50.580
Oh my.

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.580
It's that bad.

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.580
Alright, it's even worse in audio.

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.580
Yes, it's even worse in audio.

01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.580
Mr. Spanky is a regular on our show, though.

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:02.580
He does.

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:03.580
What do you think of Zach?

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.580
He gives our love advice. I'm a lesbian.

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:06.580
Oh.

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.580
Well, what do you think of Alice?

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:13.580
She likes Robin.

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.580
I like my girlfriend.

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:19.580
Alright, whatever. She can't even get you to cyber flirt. Anyway.

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:23.580
Hey, I fuckin' miss my Alice on my DDR characters, okay?

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.580
Fuckin' name my car after her, shit.

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:28.580
That someone set on fire, correct?

01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.580
Backseat, yes.

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.580
Someone set Amanda's- Someone set Alice on fire, isn't that sad?

01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.580
Yes, um, so when are we gonna get onto the fuck yous?

01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:43.580
Amanda's- Wow, I think Amanda's really eager for this. What do you think, Jamie?

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.580
Let's go to the fuck yous.

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:47.580
Let's go to the fuck yous, indeed. Here we go.

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:54.580
Okay, my first Fuck You in the Week actually goes to my belt, which, um, it's one of those

01:40:54.580 --> 01:41:01.580
neat ones that you get at, I got it at Torrid, and, uh, it has, uh, these, uh, leather, uh,

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:05.580
long leather laces that hang down the sides, and one of them broke off, so there's, you

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.580
know, the $18 one for.

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:12.580
Um, my other one goes toward, again, Roseville Goughland, but everyone heard the rant earlier.

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:19.580
And actually, even more so it goes for that manager who missed, and Steve, who runs the place.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.580
That's a good one.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580
Eat our collective pussy.

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:30.580
Yeah! No, I'm sorry. I actually, if I'm going to have something get near my pussy, it won't be done.

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.580
Zing!

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:39.580
Okay, I only use, I only prefer high quality equipment, thank you.

01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.580
NOT BROKEN LIKE THEY ARE.

01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.580
Okay. Anyway.

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:45.580
Next, um...

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.580
What did I say my other one was?

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.580
I kinda got less thanks to you for a while.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.580
Um...

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.580
I don't remember.

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.580
Anyone call me some place?

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.580
Oh, that's kinda shitty.

01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.580
Oh, what about your cheating thing?

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.580
Yeah, my tooth!

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.580
This is sorta half bad, half good.

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.580
Um, after eating a delicious dinner of, you know, sesame chicken over rice, um...

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:22.340
I'm walking over to Target and my mouth starts to hurt and I feel back to my back left molar

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.180
and there's a big break in it!

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.460
Yay, I'm happy.

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:29.780
So I'm hurting all day and the broken parts are rubbing up against the skin and my mouth

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.060
is really hurting.

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:38.020
So I had an emergency visit with my dentist next day and my dentist is awesome.

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:41.420
It turned out that the tooth that was broken was one of my wisdom teeth and not one of

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:45.260
my molars, which was a good thing, because the wisdom teeth needed to go anyway.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.660
They were slightly impacted and probably stuck on my other teeth.

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:52.340
So I went in, had the tooth out.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.140
This is what sucks is that I didn't have a way to get there, and I had to walk in the

01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.740
rain to the bus stop, wait 30 minutes in the rain.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.740
While your mouth was bleeding.

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:02.380
No, that was before the wind was blowing.

01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.620
And then I get down there, and then it's still raining when I have to come back and walk

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:11.540
from the train from the other bus stop and the whole time is my mouth is bleeding from where the

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:17.540
you know i've got my mouth full of gauze i get home and i'm tired and then this is what amazes

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:24.660
me is how many people were telling me oh you should take it easy i felt fine it's just a tooth

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:29.780
i'm telling you though you didn't go under and you only had one done but when i went under and

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:35.220
had all four done i was out for 24 hours you did not talk to me i did not exist to you but after

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:37.220
After that I was fine, so I could see that part.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:41.220
I'm gonna have them leave me awake for my other grief. All they're gonna do is just rub my mouth up.

01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:49.220
Well, I actually, when I had mine removed, I had all four out at once, but they put me under both the IV and the gas anesthetic, so I could get knocked out.

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.220
I'm not having an IV.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:44:00.220
Well, they knocked me out cold for an hour to get all four of my teeth out, and I was so wasted afterwards from all the painkillers.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:06.220
I was pretty much dead for my entire spring break that year.

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.220
So I was pretty tired. I went to work the next day and I was really exhausted.

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:13.220
They didn't expect much of anything from me.

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:16.220
When I got mine out at 15, actually I was fine. They put me out.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.220
They gave me the gas and the IV.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.220
Pretty much got home. I was sitting in the car.

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.220
My dad was waiting for me at the hot show and my ice cap came out.

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:27.220
So I was putting pink cups on my teeth because they were cold.

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:36.220
Pretty much got home, and I was talking to my friends, I was feeling fine, and the next day I was well up about twice what I should be.

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:42.220
So if any of those of you are listening who need your wisdom teeth out, and they tell you don't talk afterwards, don't talk.

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:45.220
Because they forgot to tell me, and I did, so.

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:52.220
This is what sucks about all the work I need done. I need my other three wisdom teeth out, and then I have a broken molar next to my right.

01:44:52.220 --> 01:45:03.500
I actually have to have a root canal, it has to be a crown, it has to be a crown, and I

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.180
have to shave part of the bone off of my mouth.

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.180
So that sucks.

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:08.180
So fuck my teeth.

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.180
I mean, not nuts.

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.180
No.

01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.180
Yeah, I'm not allowed to suck anything.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.180
So, you know.

01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:13.180
Nor can I spit, so.

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.200
don't take care of what you're not a lot of stuff for a few days right yeah i'm

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.920
not a lot of stuff

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.080
not nor can i

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.240
the whole of the

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.240
useless

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.600
let's do it

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.640
i think

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.720
it's bittersweet

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.520
uh...

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.960
or sucks there's not going to be swallowed

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.240
i decided to add over

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.760
on the high

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.400
on the I.V. thing because you said that you won't do the I.V.

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:49.200
You know, I didn't know they were going to do an I.V. on me, so a really, really late

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.380
fuck you to the people who did my surgery, what they did, they distracted me, they had

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:56.160
a nurse on the left talking to me, and I'm like, yeah, duh duh duh duh duh, and then

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.320
like, okay, we're just going to put some alcohol in your hand, duh duh duh duh duh, and then

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:03.800
all of a sudden, I feel this little prick on my right side, I look, they fucking stuck

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:08.000
the I.V. in me, and I feel it, all on my arm, get in my brain, I'm out.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I cannot have an IV because I will bruise very badly.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000
When they did my IV, they told me I had a week at a time that I was going to get it.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
But I mean, those things don't do that quick.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.000
They put the gas on me, and it took about a minute, and my fingers started getting tingly in the IV, and they were like,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
countdown from 100. And I was like, I'm not even going to try. And I was like, how did

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I finish that sentence? It was quick. I'm going to ask them actually if I can stay awake

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
for a second. Wow. Because I would rather be. Well, they're going to numb my mouth anyway,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
right? Yeah, it's still, yeah, when you're unconscious, it's a lot easier. You know what?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I fell asleep when I was having five killings done. But Jamie's a trooper. It was not, it

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It was, well, I know that he hit a nerve on one of them, because the nerve went numb, it was one of the major nerves in my mouth that I saved, you know, I got so good.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I gotta jump in here, I know you probably got some more fuck you's in here, but, oh, that's it? Okay, because I want to get to Amanda and Yana because they gotta go soon, so I wanted to go ahead and let them jump in with RFU's of the Week, because they've never got to do this before, so Amanda.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I know this isn't really a fuck you song, but I know it's Amanda's like favorite video series.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not anymore?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Not really.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
it is a fuck you song, because you don't like it anymore, I'm sorry.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
No, I don't like it, it's not as good.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Okay, I love you here. So these are belated, but that's okay.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Onyana's part. Fuck you to the doctors who told her her sling was swelled up and made her go to the hospital emergency room.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
She had to get surgery to get it, you know, operated on, when there was nothing wrong,

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
except she had a sinus infection and strep throat and she was dehydrated.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Who was it, Kaiser?

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Um, no, it was Jackson County.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Um...

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Oops, sorry.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Anyway, um...

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
That's alright.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And fuck you to the people who burned the back of my car!

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I stole, um, Yana's stuff out of my car.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Fuck you to Costco just because I work there, and um...

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
They make me work all the time, and...

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But they have good wieners.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
No comment, I don't like hot dogs.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Oh, the chicken bake?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I know I have several other fuck yous.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Fuck you to

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Sonoma County police officers

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
to call me on the thing and give me a CD ticket.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
How fast?

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I was going 80, but he clocked me for 75 because he actually asked me how fast I was going.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:02.000
How fast I thought I was going. Well, you know, those slides I looked down, I saw it was about 75.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And believe it or not, well actually I was going 80, but guess what he clocked me at.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Fortunately, though, the police officer was very nice. It wasn't actually him himself.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
more

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
fuck the law

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
thank you

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
um

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
fuck you to very other people who shall rename nameless

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I'm not gonna be listening anyway

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
what did they do to you?

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
oh just the general public

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
fuck the general public that doesn't listen to orange clouds

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
well let's see

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
well hang on

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I shall return, hang on

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Why don't you know, just fuck you to, um, Y'all Never Made Jamie, because...

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
No, not you, not you, not you.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
This is, um, Miss P.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Oh, Princess.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Yes.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
What did, what did she do now?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
What has she done?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Who hasn't she done? Alright.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
No, well, that's, well, like, no, he's just...

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
He's just a terrifying, terrifying person.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I've, I've met, uh, Princess P a couple times, and, uh...

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Interesting, interesting character.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Yes.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Alright.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Is that all your Fuck You?

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Oh, oh, oh, no, there's one more.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Jamie kind of waving the little Raybar wand reminded me.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Fuck You to Carl Hills who was once part of Cool World

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
who at one of our recent LiveScapes events

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
ran off with our door money

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and at the second event actually got a broken, sorry,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
changed our voicemail around and locked us out of our own voicemail

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and later said on their, oh well, I don't even know where this party is, and basically made it so that no one showed up for the party,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
and he went and sent our company under.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
So, fuck you to Cool World and Carl Hills.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And Cool World, just because I suck.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Carl Hills, he says, he just sucks fat dick. That's all it is.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000
He's got nothing better to do than steal a lot of people's money and have nothing.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000
He just sucks. That's fucking it. He sucks.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Boycott Planet New Year, thank you.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I was going to ask Yana if she had any XTF Usability.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Yeah, I just want to say fucking Jamie.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Not this Jamie, not this Jamie.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
No. Missed. Missed one.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Tucky. We call it Tucky.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Tucky.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Tucky.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Nothing comes out of his mouth. When he talks, you hear nothing but Tucky, Tucky, Tucky.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Tucky, Tucky, yeah.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.680
Yeah, that's about it. I mean, it's like it's like watching Charlie Brown you

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:45.120
From his mouth is just nothing but thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.680
tampon, thank you

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:51.200
Okay, you know, I just don't understand

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:58.880
He's so fucking annoying okay, he's like really hairy

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:06.880
I don't know. It looks like a drag queen that just has too much hair on him. You know, it looks really sad because he has too much hair on him.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.880
I'm trying to figure out what's scarier. Are we coming down to his sheet or his towel?

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.880
I think both.

01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.880
He's scarier than the other.

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:15.880
I think it's the purple towel.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:18.880
No, what it is is his towel doesn't even fit on him.

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.880
Yes.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.880
It's so scary. It's like, dude, don't come out.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.880
I have to say, at least the sheet covers more.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.880
Okay, and when he takes a bath, it's just beyond the film, okay?

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:32.880
It's just really nasty.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:35.880
You're listening to orange lesbian radio.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.880
I don't think none of them, 20 of them, though.

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:47.880
That would really suck if they did, though.

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.880
But anyways, yeah, I like to say fuck you to, uh, yeah, Jamie.

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:57.880
Oh, ok.

01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:01.880
And fuck you to Pepsi too!

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.880
I hate Pepsi!

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880
Anything else here?

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.880
I covered the Sock or Two Dizzy or Whole Sling thing already for you.

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:13.880
Oh yeah, and never ever trust like the...

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:14.880
What is it?

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.880
The county?

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.880
No, because the county really sucks.

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:26.880
Okay, check this out. I go to the county clinic and I'm just there to get some like, some kind of medicine. Just to get rid of my cold, right?

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.880
And the guy's just like, taking a look at my stomach. He's like, your spleen's falling out.

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.880
He gets another second of pain and he's like, your spleen's falling out.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:38.880
Oh yeah, and um, fuck you to the doctors who actually decided to do a pregnancy test on Yana after she...

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.880
Yes, I am pregnant by my woman's tongue.

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.880
After, she told them that she was a virgin and a lesbian, so yeah, um, we're doing March.

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:52.880
Immaculate conception, you never know. Yana could be carrying the baby Jesus. We have to check.

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:53.880
No, Rob, Rob.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.880
I am the next Virgin Mary.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.880
Rob, Rob, we're doing March.

01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.880
Yeah, we're...

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:08.880
You know, what, what I'm saying is, it, it really sucks before people just like, they don't have enough, no, no money whatsoever, right?

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:17.880
They go to these planks just to get this freakin' stupid checkup, and they send them to UC Davis where they have no fuckin' money, okay?

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.880
I'm the best with a $6,000 fuckin' phone bill!

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:21.880
Not phone bill, but...

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.880
If people wonder why I don't go to the doctor anymore unless I'm dying...

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.880
Yo...

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.880
Well, they told me my spleen was swelled up, so why am I supposed to need to sit there and have a seizure on the cable?

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.880
We gotta make sure that Jamie's not carrying the baby Jesus F either, so we gotta give her a pregnancy.

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.880
There ain't nothin' immaculate about me!

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.880
Beautiful.

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.880
Ding!

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:52.880
Well, if you have that comment, then I don't know how you want it. He's kinda ragnana.

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:55.880
What's that? It's about being immaculate?

01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:01.880
I am a virgin, okay? And it was really hard for him to just do a pelvic exam.

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:07.880
And I mean, it was scary because it sounded like every typical straight guy out there trying to get sex with a woman.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:14.880
It's going to be easy, it's going to, I'm not going to hurt you, it's just, I'm just going to do this, do that, and you know what?

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.880
It's going to be quick and simple.

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.880
Guys, you know what? I asked her, what's that?

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.880
Maybe you're rich, but you're far from the inoculant.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.880
I'm just going to take this cold hard little tool here.

01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.880
I sneak it right up inside you.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.880
Guys make the worst gynecologists.

01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:37.880
Let me tell you something. When the guy was actually

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.880
almost going to do the pelvic exam, right? He was like asking me

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.880
I don't know how to do dirty jokes or anything.

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.880
Just to make you really calm. But the girl next to me, she's like

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:57.720
I'm like looking at her like, you dumb fuck, what the hell are you doing here?

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.720
But then I asked a guy, I was like, you know, I asked him, I said, yeah, I got one joke

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:02.720
for you.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.880
What does a gynecologist and a pizza delivery guy have in common?

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:13.000
They both can smell it, but they can't eat it.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.640
That joke went in.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:21.140
all of that you'll just want to show

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.480
i'm speechless

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.640
you guys got any of the little rants left to do

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.400
no not really

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.520
but you can

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.680
but you can

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.040
through the kind of work with the packet

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.040
that it's a good thing it's a good

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:45.440
I mean, obviously this guy's got more internet access into his mouth than ever.

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:48.440
Well, he's got a mustache to hide all the stretch marks, okay?

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.240
If you see any gay guys out there, okay, I am a lesbian. Let you guys know.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.040
My imagination just broke.

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.040
I'm sorry.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:05.440
But no, just to let you guys know, if you ever guys...

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:12.440
If you guys ever go to the basses or anywhere, any gay club, and see some guy with like a

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:19.440
really bad mustache, okay, he's got more stress on you than this bunch of stupid guys.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.440
Okay?

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.440
I'm sorry.

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.440
But, yeah, anyway, maybe even mustaches for added pleasure.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.440
And with that, we do have to take off because I'm really hungry.

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:34.440
I like how the only thing distinctly Bamani related about this segment is the music playing

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.440
is the music playing in the background.

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.440
Thank you.

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:37.440
You are so kind.

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.440
I can just kiss you, but no, I can't.

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:39.440
Here, lick my chocolate nipple.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:58.120
Thank you, the official Lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.120
Thank you guys very much for being here.

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.120
We appreciate it.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.120
Yes, this crazy one here.

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:06.120
My name is Jonna, and we'll be back soon, just like, you know, put a little bit in my show.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:10.120
She'll be back next weekend, two drink minimum, don't forget to tip your waitress.

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:11.120
Yeah.

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:12.120
She'll have more jokes.

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.120
It will be like the next Howard Stern, you know, but a little bit more better, okay?

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:22.120
Amanda, thank you for being with us, and, uh, wow.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:27.120
Hi. Or, bye, yes. Time for me to go.

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:33.120
Wait, wait, wait. You know what? I have to say this to all the people that are listening to this.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:37.120
Okay, don't picture it. Just have it inside your head, okay?

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.120
Monkey-fuck-people-ball.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.120
Thank you, dear.

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120
Twitch?

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:52.120
There had to be one big monkey.

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.120
Anyway, thank you, my ladies, for being here.

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:26.120
Good night, have a good night.

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.120
I can make you copy that, we'll be in touch.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:33.120
I can't do it right now because we're broadcasting, but I'll get you one later in the week.

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:36.120
Okay. All right, bye. Take care.

01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:39.120
All right.

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.120
Here we go.

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.120
Moving right along.

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:47.120
Oh, did you have any FUs, Jamie?

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.120
Um...

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:52.120
I don't know about any more, because she's always got a lot.

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.120
Um, um, um...

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.120
I'd like you to my strange addiction to dark chocolate.

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.120
Alright, moving on to Loki.

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.120
I don't know how to follow that.

02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:05.120
I'm not a lesbian, I can't follow that.

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.120
Oh well.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.120
Um, Steve, you know my regular refuse of the week.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:13.120
Uh, stupid drivers, stupid people.

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.120
People that talk to me.

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:31.120
People will talk to me that you don't know in person, people who work behind the counters, Golf Land, and Nickel City for not having anything there and making me drive down there to go check it out and there's nothing there.

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:40.120
So that. Yeah, they make you pay $2 to get in. I'm thinking, ooh, there might be an upstairs and an downstairs. Nope, what you see is what you got.

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.120
But, it was...

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.120
Anyways, so, uh, you have to do that.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:52.120
You have to do the CDR, uh, East Coast Invasion for thinking that their servers could actually handle people leeching 100 sim files.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.120
Why are you fucking stupid or something?

02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:55.120
That's never gonna work.

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:58.120
It never worked last time, but it's not gonna work this time.

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.120
So, you have to do them.

02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:03.120
And, that's all I've got for you right now.

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:09.120
I have to do the stupid movie gallery, the store, the chain that I deal with because they're all frickin' southern.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.120
Stupid.

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.120
Okay, fine. They're Midwestern and stupid.

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.120
Alright, and uh...

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:20.120
Yeah, I know there's too much more than going.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.120
I have to do the stupid Del Taco for...

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.120
It makes me feel sick.

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.120
Yeah.

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.120
That's it.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.120
Alright, moving on to Black Lab.

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.120
You feel like you just swallowed a machete?

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120
Yeah.

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:38.120
I thought... This isn't my...

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:53.120
I'm sorry, I forgot Irony. Hold on, I'll find you music. Working on it, working on it, working on it.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.120
Alright, here we go.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:02.120
Okay, now that it's on, let's see...

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:10.120
Actually, surprisingly, I have very little to rant about this week because I've actually had a good week.

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:15.120
I got away from school. I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in six months.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:39.120
I hate the rain, especially when I have to drive in it.

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:46.120
the rain, especially when I have to drive in it. I think I'm coming off my sugar high

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:54.880
now. That sucks. I'll eat dark chocolate, please.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.680
That's it? You usually email me like ten FUs a week and you come to the station, you get

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:07.480
to be here, be a part of the show experience, you can only come up with two lousy FUs.

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.000
you make that jack right

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.920
i'd like to see him cry

02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:17.120
that i could pocket for it

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.680
that's it

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:23.600
if you don't want to know

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:26.600
yeah i don't think i have anything

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.760
all right

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.640
my if you really

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:32.640
i'd like to uh... give a big if you'd my mother

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.040
i was at the house today

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.720
I was making a payment because we have an insurance plan under both of our names so

02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:41.420
that I get a better rate because I have an accent on my record, they don't.

02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:44.920
And I still say, F U, that accent was not my fault.

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.440
You were speeding, you son of a bitch.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:52.580
I don't care if I have the stop sign.

02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:55.640
My F U goes to my mom because when I went to make a payment, I get a phone call about

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.640
two hours later.

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:59.700
Did you go through the Christmas presents when you were here?

02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.400
Somebody shipped a Christmas present!

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.440
Somebody shipped it to Christmas and it's all wrong!

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.620
No, I did not go through the Christmas presents.

02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:09.580
Are you sure? You're lying to me. Why are you laughing?

02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:13.660
I'm laughing because you're being a dumbass.

02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.020
Yeah, F you.

02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:18.860
You ask me that every year. Every damn year you ask me if I shake the Christmas presents.

02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:23.500
I don't care. Christmas got old, you know, once I left house. You know, I don't get what I want

02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:30.500
anymore. I get clothes.

02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:37.500
I don't know why, but for some strange reason, it's like I cannot come up with anything that

02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:48.940
I want for Christmas anymore. It's like, why am I not being my usual greedy self? Normally,

02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:54.540
I have a list of like twenty things that I would want, which I don't, and well, I don't

02:04:54.540 --> 02:05:06.540
And yet, this year, I come up with, like, two things. And they're things that I would need. It's like, my change in mentality is really upsetting me.

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:18.540
Alright, I got, like, a little smaller for you, because they're a complete more or less. Um, I've ever, okay, I bought, I went out and bought showreels because my girlfriend wants to see them.

02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.540
Yes.

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:20.540
You should have borrowed it for me.

02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:23.940
That's alright, it's only 8 bucks. I really don't, it doesn't matter.

02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:29.040
So anyways, so I bought Showgirls, so it's huge, and I wanted to watch it, I don't know why, but whatever.

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.840
So we watched it, and I had this urge to go to a strip club.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.440
The thing is, they're so fucking expensive. Why do they have to be so expensive?

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.640
We'll go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night, obviously not this Tuesday or next Thursday, it's the holidays.

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:47.740
Go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night, it's unlimited drinks, bottomless, for $14.

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:51.240
And if you sit in the front row, you won't have to pay like a dollar or something for the strippers.

02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:53.240
It's good. It's a good deal. You take 20 bucks, you have fun on that.

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:55.240
I know, I've just done before.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.240
Yeah, I knew.

02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:00.240
Look, even I go to a strip club, and we all know.

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:04.240
It's just so fucking- I'm talking about lap dances, okay?

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:06.240
Lap dances are fucking expensive.

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:08.240
Two song minimum, that's $40.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:10.240
I'll get you a lap dance for Christmas.

02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:14.240
That's right.

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:19.240
Don't buy a lap, you have to make it.

02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:23.240
Cuz they can't, they can't.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.240
You might get crapped that way.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:29.240
They're not allowed to actually sit on the lap anymore.

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:32.240
In LA, they have touching. Oh yeah.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.240
Oh dear god. I know where I'm getting dragged.

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:50.240
Oh, no, I'm not dragging you nowhere, because it was at this one place that Eric Punkknight on The Snack Spineboards, his cousin, goes there and reaches that place quite a bit. He knows where it's at, I don't know, so... No need for sure, folks.

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:54.240
Okay, back to me again because I'm slow and I'm coming up with things now.

02:06:54.240 --> 02:07:04.240
As for the Tuesday night thing, I hated how good shows always say they leave off in a really suspenseful part like 24 this week.

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.240
Yeah, fuck 24.

02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:09.240
It's like three weeks on 24. It's like three weeks.

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.240
Three weeks.

02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.240
Three weeks.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:14.240
Why? Why do they make us wait?

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:19.240
Okay, I'm going to suspense like that for Buffy, but that's because they encountered our cable.

02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:21.240
And I didn't see the last episode of Buffy.

02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:23.240
Yes, Buffy recorded.

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:26.240
I'm not sure. I don't think it's there.

02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:28.240
I'm sorry. 21st episode.

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.240
Uh-oh.

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:35.240
Okay, first of all, Buffy is the only good writing that happens to be on TV right now.

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:36.240
Unless you count-

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.240
Where does writing come into Buffy?

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:40.240
Shut up and let me finish.

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:45.240
Unless you count Angel or Firefly, which are all written by the same guy, okay?

02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:47.240
Yes.

02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:56.240
It's like sitting and watching a movie every week. Good writing makes a good show.

02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:59.240
You know, Firefly looked like a live-action version of Cowboy Bebop.

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:00.240
A lot with good acting.

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.240
Well, not Cowboy Bebop, but Outlaw Star.

02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:06.240
I only watched, like, part of the first episode of Outlaw Star.

02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.240
Well, 24 is the better because...

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:12.240
24 is unique, and it has Kiefer still in it.

02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.240
The Kiefer's still hot to this day, but I'd still have to go with Bucky. I'm sorry.

02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:26.240
No, but actually, I find it funny because, uh, I actually, uh, the Kiefer Southern looks, like, better than Bucky.

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:29.240
Just, I mean, what's your name? Sarah Michelle Gellar?

02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:30.240
Okay, but, but...

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:34.240
Like, here's Bucky, er, here's Sarah Michelle Gellar, and here's Kiefer Southern.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.240
But did Kiefer ever do Rocky? Aha, no.

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.240
Or do I care?

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.240
I did.

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.240
Moving right along, this debate won't end if I don't end it now.

02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.240
24! 24! 24! I'm sending subliminal messages!

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.240
24! 24!

02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.240
Don't make me smack your ass!

02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:54.240
You will watch, 24!

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:56.240
I'm still toting boots right now!

02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:58.240
Think about it, isn't Buffy on at 8?

02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:00.240
No.

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.240
They are on at the same time, my bad.

02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.240
Alright, anyway.

02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:06.240
If you're watching 24.

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.240
Watch him take one, watch the other, Jesus.

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.240
Alright, here we go.

02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.240
Uh, do I have any FUs left?

02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:15.240
I don't think I do. You're right, I don't.

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:19.240
We're gonna, we're so gonna end this show.

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.240
No, Jamie, you're starting to steal the microphone!

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.240
We have a fight, a fight just broke out.

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:28.240
God, this has been, this has been the Jerry Springer episode of Oregon's Radio.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.240
We've had lesbians, we've had a fight break out.

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.240
I've got, I've got the sound samples, I've got TV.

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.240
It's gonna be about, ah!

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.240
Alright, alright, alright. Ah, jeez, now Panda's getting thrown.

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.240
Alright.

02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.240
Can I, can I, can I do the chat room entries now?

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.240
Moving right along.

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:58.240
DSTSS SoCalKick says

02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:02.240
Over limit and being $145 total bill

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.240
is my F.U.

02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:09.240
I don't know what he meant. Oh, credit card? Oh.

02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:10.240
Credit card, right?

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.240
I have no idea. If he means, like, his bandwidth or credit card or what, I must have missed it.

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:21.240
But he also says, Merry fucking Christmas. I have a broken digital camera and a paid-off cell phone bill along with hair beads and bleach costs.

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:26.240
He must have said, oh, he's pissed at me now because I didn't know what it was.

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:30.240
Ah, that's it. If you're going to yell at me, I'm saving you for last.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:41.240
Alright, Stresa says he wants to throw out a huge F.U. to his dad for telling mom that he's only going to put $150 into Christmas, and he found out that Woody's applying that $150.

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.240
He's putting that cash in his circulation to fix the sink that he broke at least six months ago.

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.240
He should be fixing the sink because it needs to be fixed, not do it as a fucking Christmas gift to mom.

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:52.240
Hmm. Interesting.

02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.240
That's a lame Christmas money.

02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:02.240
23rd Magus says, I have a big bah humbug or a fuck you to the Christmas season.

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.240
Christmas sucks when you're broke.

02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:07.240
Bork the whole fucking season.

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:09.240
He put bork.

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.240
Maybe he meant pork, I don't know.

02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:13.240
A very accomplished fuck you to Matsuri Japan, I beat you bitch.

02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:16.240
Wahaha, cough, okay, out.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:25.240
The pizza delivery boy and the bandicologist are also hot and to your door in three minutes.

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:34.240
Angel says, F you to the Max 2 machine at Rona Mark Scandia because it stopped taking tokens today. Bad DDR machine.

02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:43.240
Come visit our neck of the woods. You'll have some real inks built up in you. Don't worry.

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:51.240
Doc Tetsuya says, F you to himself for not waiting for Max USA to save before switching games.

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:54.240
Shouldn't you save that privately?

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:55.240
What?

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.240
Okay.

02:11:58.240 --> 02:11:59.240
Anyway, next question.

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.240
Okay, I don't...

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.240
Good.

02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.240
I must have missed something.

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.240
Good.

02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:10.240
Let's go to Brak2000 says, F you to missing the first half of the show since some people came over to try out DDR.

02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:14.240
Even though it was a good night for me and I was passing 7-footers, which is a big improvement for me.

02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.240
Good word.

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:23.240
If anyone wants to know what to give me for Christmas next year, pick up the December 2002 maximum issue, it's page 78. I think you'll be very up.

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:26.240
Is that the bottom of the page?

02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.240
Fuck the bottom of the page, is that the top of the fucking page?

02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:30.240
May I do Vidpower's FUs now?

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:31.240
Yeah.

02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.240
Okay, Vidpower says,

02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:37.240
I'm actually a happy bunny this week, I don't really have any FUs. No FUs for you!

02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:48.040
I'm the F U Nazi. Fair enough. Did you hear that? Vidpow says, no FUs for you. He's the

02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.520
F U Nazi. I was looking at the email, no we do not have anybody email. I'm checking the

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:58.880
last ones that just came in. Our bestest friend in the whole wide world, Quinn, says F U to

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:04.440
getting something that someone else got you for Christmas three days before Christmas.

02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:19.720
getting something that someone else like a fruitcake like herpes all right uh 23

02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:24.080

well they only go on their guitars

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.920
and decapitating their mom wow because remember

02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:57.440
their power is so great it kicks your mom right in the face

02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.440
Ow.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:05.440
Remember, 9 out of 10 winners get their heads cut off by real ninjas.

02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.440
Twins adding an explanation so we don't keep calling him Herbie Man or whatever we were saying.

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:16.440
Explanation, lives with mom, but dad got him a DVD box set yesterday, the Back to the Future box set,

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.440
that his grandma on the other side of the family already got him.

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:23.440
So, that's why you asked for a seat.

02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:26.440
You asked for a seat, take it back.

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.440
Amen. Get something you really want.

02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.440
That is the official Orange Lounge advice of the day.

02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.440
By the way, do take care of this, though.

02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.440
One of the presents for getting prepared.

02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:37.440
Word.

02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:39.440
Uh, you have another one, Logie?

02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:41.440
Oh, okay, cool.

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:43.440
All right, we're gonna end the FUs of the Week.

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:45.440
That's it. Nail in the coffin. Segment's done.

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:47.440
It is already 8.50.

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:49.440
We're damn near close to the end of the show already,

02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:50.440
and you know what we gotta do?

02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.440
You know what we still gotta do?

02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:52.440
Listless.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440
We gotta do listless, and we gotta do the cage match.

02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.440
We gotta do them both.

02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:05.440
Let's take the opportunity during Cage Match to get our stuff ready for List List.

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:08.440
So tonight's List List, Jamie, tell us about tonight's List List.

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.440
Best Benmani song released this year, 2002.

02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:16.440
SoCalKicks says I forgot one of his.

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:17.440
I thought I got them all.

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.440
I closed your window, SoCal.

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.440
I'm sorry.

02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:20.440
Send it again.

02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:21.440
I'll read it.

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.440
I thought I got it.

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.440
My bad.

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.280
Alright, so we're going to do the cage match while we prepare our list. We're going to do

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.960
Best Bamani Song Least in 2002, so it can't be old school. It has to be new school.

02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:40.440
We're talking Max II, 8th and 7th style, I believe. 7th style was early this year.

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:46.000
Guitar Freaks.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.840
So, any of those games you can pick for Best Bamani Song of 2002.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.960
Because next week on the show, Jamie, what's gonna happen next week on the show?

02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.120
We ain't gonna be here.

02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.360
We ain't gonna be here. We're still sort of debating, I guess, what we're gonna do. We might do a

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:00.000
Best Of.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.600
Someone's cable might be working, namely me.

02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.640
We'll surprise everybody.

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.920
So there's gonna be one of two things happening. There's gonna be a Best Of show or you're gonna get

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:11.120
the Jamie experience.

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.040
Yeah. And we're playing all Eurobeat and TAC.

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:18.160
So deal with it!

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.160
And I will accept yes.

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:50.160
We take less breaks and do more talking.

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.160
Okay, let's get into it.

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:11.160
Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a winner for two weeks in a row.

02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:14.160
This song was the victor of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160
Because I'm fucking cool.

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.160
Because you are fucking cool.

02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.360
The winner of the Orange Launch Cage match was...

02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:21.160
Jamie, tell us about it, because it was your submission.

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:24.160
It was... this is... by the way, it's not Happy Hardcore, it's just labeled.

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.160
Okay, yeah.

02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.660
Um, but it is the, uh, techno-style remix of the Knight Rider theme.

02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:33.660
I remember being in the third grade and drawing pictures of Kit in the middle of class.

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:36.660
Because I thought the part was cool. I hated it because I was off.

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:39.160
Oh! Dang, okay.

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.160
I got the real F.U. from SoCal Kicks, and it's huge.

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:42.660
Okay.

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:44.160
I don't know how I missed this.

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.160
How did I miss that?

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:47.300
Anyway, okay, wait, we'll go back to FU for a sec.

02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:49.960
FU to the lousy as hell goodbye party Kendra had.

02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:52.640
Much love to you and your leaving to Japan, but that party sucked.

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:56.360
FU Jackie for still playing games with me and not being sure if things are gonna happen

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:57.360
or not.

02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.800
FU CyberPixels and not having auto shell access.

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:03.480
Fuck you Pearl for needing shell access and not being able to get PHP image gallery thumbnail

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:04.600
or script to work.

02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:06.920
Fuck you Metroid Prime for its vague artifact clues.

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.180
Fuck you Ruben for the whole camera deal, even though we got it settled and now I now

02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:15.480
I'll have a new digicam and FU cell phone service for only being 200 minutes and me going 463 minutes

02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:19.340
All right, we're done. No more FUs. Oh, yes

02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:25.660
So here it is. There's a clip of last week's winner the Knight Rider theme song because Jamie says kid is hot

02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:31.400
The car was fucking amazing. I I still want to get that car

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:38.400
Alright, here we go. Here's last week's winner.

02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:57.800
Alright, Jamie's hoping to make this one three victories in a row, but it's gonna...

02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:59.300
And if you love me, you'll vote for it.

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:03.300
It's gonna have to win, and Chat Room, you guys will have the final vote.

02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:06.300
Now, we don't play that whole song because it did win the last couple weeks,

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:09.300
so we kind of give it a little bit of a disadvantage.

02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:12.300
But you guys are familiar with it because you listen to the show every week, don't you?

02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.300
But you guys can vote for either that, or you can vote for one of the two new songs.

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:18.800
I'm gonna go ahead and do my entry first, then we'll get to Loki's entry.

02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:24.800
My pick for this week is going to be a popular artist, Ayumi Hamasaki.

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.800
A lot of you seem to dig her.

02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:29.960
And I've got a trance remix of the song, Connected.

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.080
This is going to be my entry for this week.

02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:36.440
And I like this song because the video reminds me of Bjork, if you've ever seen this video.

02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:37.440
It's pretty cool.

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:38.440
It's very Bjork-esque.

02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.440
Actually, I don't have it.

02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:40.440
Brad does.

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:42.560
Our friend Brad here at Wriggle on the show, he has it.

02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:44.040
But this is going to be it.

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:46.760
So here's our first entry in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.940
This is Sayumi Hamasaki with a trance remix.

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:53.000
I'm not sure of the remix name, but it's called Connected.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So here, enjoy.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:36.580
Mi te mette, mi te mette, mi te sele te iru Te mo mi akete, mi kekete, mi kurepe iru

02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:10.580
Me too can't take, me too damn it.

02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:14.580
Me too made it, me too made it.

02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:17.580
Me too so what do you do?

02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:24.580
Tell me I can't take, me too can't take, me too damn it.

02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:31.580
I'm not leaving you, me too whatever, me too whatever.

02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:02.580
Hello!

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:03.580
Hey, we're back!

02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:04.580
Hey, how'd you like that one?

02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:18.220
That was Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, the latest entry into the Orange Lounge Cage match,

02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:23.140
where the winning song, voted by you in the chatroom, gets put into regular rotation on

02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:25.180
Orange Lounge Radio for the next week.

02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:28.140
So, last week's winner was Knight Rider, you can vote for that.

02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:32.740
This week we have Yumi Hamasaki with Connected, or, lowkey, what's the next track?

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:35.900
Um, the next track is going to be from the wonderful...

02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:38.860
Wait, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you because we didn't get feedback on the Yumi Hamasaki.

02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:40.380
Sorry, we have to do the feedback part.

02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:42.060
Jamie, what did you think of that one?

02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:46.340
I like how you made the best one because it was more repetitive, and I'd have to say...

02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:49.340
Honey, Black Lab.

02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:53.860
Um, a little bit of that, I didn't hear it because I went to the bathroom real quick.

02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:55.180
uh...

02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:59.180
that was a great like

02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:02.180
uh...

02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:07.540
uh...

02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:09.420
i'll look at that

02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:10.140
uh...

02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:12.700
i'm going to go ahead and get it i'm actually not going to have it is headed

02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:15.780
to go with my own head i'm going to give it about me too i do like to talk to

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:17.300
people of your kids

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.980
uh... it is a little bit

02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:22.860
and uh... i hope it's a problem

02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:27.860
I hope that the chat room gets their way, whatever they play.

02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:30.860
Alright, now Loki, I'm sorry, you can do your...

02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:38.860
Alright, now this is going to become a trainer because I forget which track is on the CD, but what it is, is it's actually a song from the...

02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:42.860
Well, not really a hit movie, but it's a cool movie, Run Lola Run.

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:49.860
This is Believe by Franca Potente, you also might have seen her in Resident Evil, she was the main character.

02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:51.860
Actor and singer.

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:55.140
Now this, oh this is going to be cool because I like running all around. Let's hear this.

02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:55.640
Alright.

02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:01.140
But now I have to intro this. This, um, the sample you're in here are actually the whole, uh, song.

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:06.140
It's got part of another song in the beginning of it because this is on one of my mix CDs that I actually mixed together.

02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:12.340
So, it, it doesn't cut off anything in the song because the song begins with dialogue in German, so it doesn't really matter, but...

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:14.440
Okay, we're going to make sure this is the right one, okay?

02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:14.940
Yeah.

02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:15.740
Here we go, here we go.

02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:22.740
I don't believe in trouble. I don't believe in love.

02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.500
I don't believe there's nothing left but running here again

02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:52.900
I don't believe in promise, I don't believe in chance

02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:56.360
I don't believe you can resist the things that make you so

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:59.760
I don't believe in silence, for silence it feels low

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:02.940
I don't believe in energy, the tension is too low

02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:06.440
I don't believe in panic, I don't believe in fear

02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:10.440
I don't believe in prophecy, so don't waste any tears

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.440
I don't believe reality would be the way it should

02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:30.440
But I believe in fantasy if you just understood

02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.440
I don't believe in history, I don't believe in truth

02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:37.440
But don't believe justice to me, it's not an issue of use

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:18.440
I don't believe there's nothing left of running here again

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:29.440
I don't believe you promise, I don't believe you chance

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:32.440
Adopting the energy, the temperature is too low

02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:35.440
Adopting the energy, the energy is here

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.440
I don't give a fuck about this and it's still so close to my face

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.440
God, God

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:07.440
And while I am in this place, I will not be able to find you

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:17.440
And I just can't tell you how many times you've gone, gone, gone

02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.440
Drop my skills, drop it, drop it, let's do it, let's go

02:28:47.440 --> 02:29:05.240
I wonder what you got, got, what you need, I'm fine, fine

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:06.740
Can I get a sentence?

02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:08.540
I'm not the one that really liked it

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.740
I'm just too young to tell you better

02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:13.340
I'm not the one that really liked it

02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:14.340
I'm just too young to tell you better

02:29:44.340 --> 02:30:13.100
All right, that was the end of that one because that was part of a kind of a Megamix CD.

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:17.580
So, there you have it. Your three entries for this week's Cage Match. You have Knight

02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:21.820
Rider, last week's victor, two weeks in a row. Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, and that

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:25.820
track was Believe. What'd you think of Believe, Jamie?

02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:34.820
Um, I think it would've put me to sleep, had I gotten to do it. Um, I think it was a good

02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:37.820
one. Seven. Seven for Jamie. Black Lab.

02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:43.820
I'd kind of like to be gay, but then it kind of starts over with a little bit of a cut to the end.

02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:48.820
But, I'll just kind of keep going, give it an eight and a half.

02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:50.820
Eight and a half, Loki.

02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:58.820
I like that song, because I like that movie. The movie is really sweet, and every time I hear that song it makes me think of the movie, so I'll give it a ten.

02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:04.820
Alright, I do like that song, it was cool. I agree with Black Lab, it started off better than it ended.

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:07.820
It was a little, I thought it was more repetitive than the Yumi track.

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:11.820
But it does remind me of Run Little Run which kicked a lot of ass, so I'm gonna give that one an 8 as well.

02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:18.820
So, that was Believe. So now you can send your votes to us right now in the chat room.

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:24.820
Just private message them to me, you can vote for Knight Rider, Connected, or Believe.

02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:27.820
And we will count up your votes during this next break.

02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:32.820
If they don't vote for Knight Rider, David Hasselhoff will cry.

02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:06.140
list before the show's over so uh join us we'll be right back eventually unless we take a nap

02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:08.100
I give up?

02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:12.240
It's all about the Andes Indias, baby

02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:24.120
Uh huh, feel

02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:26.320
Uh huh, feel

02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:29.260
All about Emilia

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.140
All about Emilia

02:32:32.140 --> 02:32:41.140
What you wanna do? Wanna be hackers? Cold crackers, slackers? Wasting time with all the chap who yakkers?

02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:46.140
Nine to five, chillin' at new detectors? Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?

02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:49.140
Yeah, bein' the bills with my mass programming skills?

02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:54.140
Yeah, I'm fraggin' my hard drive for thrills. I got me a hundred gigabytes around.

02:32:54.140 --> 02:32:59.140
I never beat trolls and I don't reach them. Install the two online in my house.

02:32:59.140 --> 02:33:02.140
Always at my PC, double clickin' on my Ms. House

02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:05.140
Upgrade my system, at least twice a day I'm frickin' plug and play

02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:08.140
I ain't afraid of YTK, I'm down to build gates

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:11.140
I call em' money for sure, phone em' up at home

02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:14.140
Man, I make em' do my tech support, it's all about the opinions

02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:17.140
You gotta be the dumbest dudey I've ever seen

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:20.140
You've got Wyatt out all over your screen

02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:23.140
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato

02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:25.140
What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:28.140
You're usin' a 286, don't make me laugh

02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:30.640
Your window boots up and what a day and a half

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.140
You can back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette

02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:36.140
You're the biggest joke on the internet

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.140
Your database is a disaster

02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:41.140
Your wax and your modem tryin' to make it go faster

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:44.140
Hey fella, I bet you're still living in your parents' cellar

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:46.640
Downloading pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:49.140
And posting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er

02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:51.640
I should do the world a favor and cast you like Old Yeller

02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:54.640
Your just about as useless as jpegs to Helen Keller

02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:10.040
My new computer's got the cards that rock, but it was obsolete before I opened the box.

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:13.040
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.040
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique.

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:17.040
Your laptop is a month old?

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:21.040
Well, that's great, if you could use a nice, heavy, and paper weight.

02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:24.040
My digital media is right protection.

02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:26.840
Every file inspected, no virus is detected

02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:29.340
I beta tested every operating system

02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:32.040
Gave props to some and others I dissed them

02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:34.640
While your computer crashes, mine's multitasking

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:37.140
It does all my work without me even asking

02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:39.740
Got a black screen monitor, 40 inches wide

02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:42.340
I believe that your test and your sketch on the side

02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:45.140
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user

02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:47.740
You've got your own news crew, own total loser

02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:50.240
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:53.140
Once you get your CPU in a box or cracker jack

02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:55.640
Pray me I'm lying well you know that I'll beat you

02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:58.160
If I ever meet you I'll control, I'll lead you

02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:00.020
What, what

02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:17.320
What better

02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:20.160
Than fooling anyone else

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:27.160
Jamie, do another spur of the moment promo for us, please.

02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:32.160
If you don't listen to Orange Lounge Radio, you're a fucking loser.

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.160
Alright, we're back. Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.160
Unfortunately, we just had a DSL lapse right there. I don't know what happened.

02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:44.160
Suddenly, I lost. I was wondering, why hasn't the chatroom said anything for the past two minutes?

02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:52.160
And we just dropped stream, unfortunately, and you guys all got dropped to come back, but our bus has gone down a little bit.

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.160
Go figure. Go figure. I don't know. That was weird.

02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.160
I apologize to Chat Room. 25 shows and that's never happened to us, though.

02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.160
On Understation Live, that used to happen every other week.

02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.160
I've been there for that a couple of weeks.

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:11.160
Yeah, so I apologize to you guys. Just reconnect. We should be back now.

02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:17.480
and I'm taking the last votes. I may have missed some of your votes. I may have missed

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:24.040
some of your votes for... did I count that one already? I think I did. I just got one

02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:29.160
last vote. This is interesting now because since I had a lap stare, I got some last-minute

02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:32.640
votes for the cage match, and that's caused it to have a tie.

02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:33.640
Damn you.

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:34.640
Fight my ass.

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:38.600
Fight my ass. So wait a minute, this is very interesting.

02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.960
We have a tie now. Both edged out Knight Rider by one

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:47.760
vote each. Die. Connected has three votes, Believe has three votes. We've never had a

02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:49.040
tie. I get to break the tie.

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:52.520
On this show. No. No, the way the tie is going to be broken is now

02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:56.560
we collectively here get to break the tie. We're gonna add votes one at a time

02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:01.360
between... All four of us. All four of us. So we might tie again and then in that case we'll have to

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.360
get the people who voted for Knight Rider to re-vote.

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.360
I think we should just do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:08.360
Yes, in that case, if we tie again, we're going to do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:10.360
But let's see, we're going to add votes here in the room.

02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:12.360
So this is between Connected and Believe.

02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:13.360
You're going to vote for your own song.

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:14.360
You're going to let Jamie pick?

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.360
Because Black Lab wants to vote too.

02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:21.360
Okay, well we'll assume that Loki and I each vote for the songs we put in.

02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:23.360
So we cancel each other out.

02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.360
So, Jamie?

02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:29.360
How about this?

02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:31.360
I vote for Knight Rider.

02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.360
You pulled the point.

02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:38.360
Okay, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, then we do it.

02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:41.360
Because otherwise we don't want one person's answer askew in the other.

02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:45.360
We don't want you to intentionally fucking it up.

02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:49.360
How am I going to fuck this up?

02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:54.360
Alright, I did get the last two votes came in right after that lapse

02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:59.360
from people who hadn't voted yet. I got the rest of your votes, I'm pretty sure.

02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:03.360
So, here we go.

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:07.360
Okay, you got your written down, Black Lab? Okay.

02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.360
Let's see Jamie's. Oh, Black Lab's got one vote there.

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.360
And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, we have another tie.

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:21.360
Nope, nope. This is rock, paper, scissors time, junkin' between myself and Loki.

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:25.360
Here we go. Ready? Here we go, here we go, here we go.

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:29.060
Ready? One, two, three. Oh!

02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:32.460
Scissors, cuts, paper, and connected wins.

02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.960
Very close, though. Very close. That means next week I have to pick a song that's going to last another two weeks.

02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:41.560
Yep, that means Jamie. But Jamie, you do have the longest rankings, really, because that holiday show we had there, too,

02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:44.960
or those week we didn't do it, it was three weeks.

02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:51.600
All right, so connected wins the cage match by by by a hair literally so

02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:55.120
There it is

02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.640
Okay, now we're gonna go right into listless

02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:04.200
We got to hurry up and do this segment because we're almost out of time, but we're gonna do listless tonight

02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:09.080
So I got to clear out all these windows Jamie. Tell them about tonight's listless. Um, this listless is gonna be

02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.280
the best

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:15.040
Bemani song that was released in 2002

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:18.960
which is going to be Guitar Freak's 8th mix

02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:20.760
Drummania's 7th

02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:22.720
Bemania the final

02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:26.040
2DX's 7th came out

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:29.280
yeah 7th came out this year

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.240
yeah it was early this year

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:33.640
8th style

02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:36.040
and Max 2

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:39.920
okay so all those things, also guitar

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.040
Max U.S.A? Yeah, Max U.S.A.

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.560
GuitarFreak's uh...

02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:44.720
I already named it.

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:48.840
I forgot about Max U.S.A. That might actually change my list a little bit.

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.600
Although you probably put the song I'm thinking of.

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:57.160
I forgot about Max U.S.A. That's a good one.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.480
Uh...

02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:01.920
You also...GuitarFreak's seventh mix would count too.

02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:04.880
As well as Beatmania's seventh mix, I believe.

02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:08.800
Which is also being mentioned to me that Beatmania...

02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.320
BeatMania 3 in the final as well, which is being mentioned to me also, by the way, to

02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:15.880
remind everybody that it's coming out on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.

02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.240
Well, not DDR Extreme, but BeatMania 7th for the home system.

02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.440
Is it the final or is it 7th?

02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:24.440
It's coming out for the home system.

02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:26.000
Yeah, final is going to be next year.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.360
All right, so here we go.

02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:34.240
Best Bae Money song of 2002, Jamie, or we always start with Jamie.

02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:35.720
We'll start with Black Lab tonight.

02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:38.040
We're going to start with Black Lab tonight.

02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:47.320
Okay, starting off with my number three, I listened to it, I kind of liked athletic songs

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:54.480
before, just like from like beat stage, fifth, sixth, so he was two, but what I heard when

02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:01.200
they finally made the move to seven key in eighth style, the War Game was one of my favorites

02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.200
now.

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:03.200
Huh?

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.960
That's my number three.

02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:07.960
Your game is his number three choice.

02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:08.960
Loki!

02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:09.960
Okay.

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.960
Um, it's one of my favorite songs on BeatMania 2DX and I made a sim file for it.

02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.320
The sound of goodbye.

02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:17.800
The sound of goodbye.

02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:21.280
That's a good song.

02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.280
Jamie!

02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:23.280
What's your number three pick?

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:24.280
Guideca.

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:25.280
Guideca!

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:27.280
Did I smell it right?

02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:28.280
Yes?

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:29.280
Uh, yeah.

02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:30.280
Okay.

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:31.280
I think it's two Cs.

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:32.280
Two Cs.

02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.280
I did put two Cs, yes.

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:34.280
Is it Guideca or Guideca or...

02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:36.720
my dad

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:37.880
okay my bad

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:42.020
my number three pick uh... was also the sound of goodbye i also put that as my

02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:43.140
number three pick

02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:45.120
pick something different um...

02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:48.080
i'm afraid that you're

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:50.500
is here you go how about uh... you leave me alone

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:54.980

02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:58.620
from uh... max you say

02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:03.600
i'd never have an alternative to my number two choice

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:06.920
It is the Guitar Freaks version of Breakdown.

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:10.800
Sounds much better than the TDR version.

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.120
Plus it has a funny little video thing.

02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.940
Now this is top Bomani game, or Bomani music?

02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:21.420
Oh, okay.

02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:22.480
Bomani music.

02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:23.920
Alright, this year.

02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:24.960
Alright, um...

02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:27.280
Let's change his mind then.

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:30.420
Vanity Angel.

02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:35.900

02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:54.460

02:42:57.600 --> 02:42:58.600
years old.

02:42:58.600 --> 02:42:59.600
I'm older than that!

02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.600
I'm older than God.

02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:01.600
Okay, um...

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:14.600
There was a version of, um, uh, Do It All Night that was on, uh, BeatMania 5th Mix.

02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:15.600
Anyway.

02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:16.600
Anyway.

02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:17.600
Shmup!

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:18.600
Yes, hi, hello.

02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:22.440
Uh, my number two pick is, uh, The Beauty of Silence from 2DX 7th Style.

02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:23.440
I love that song.

02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:26.440
This is a pretty silent list.

02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:28.440
The beauty of silence.

02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:31.440
All of this silence and leaving people alone.

02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:33.440
Oh, yay.

02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:41.440
Well, okay. My next one is actually something that sounded good at first, but then the next version of it that was released was better.

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:47.440
It's another one from 2DX8 style. It's the another version of Murmur Twins.

02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:52.440
The piano scales in that song own you.

02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:56.440
Alright, that's your number one pick. Best but money song all year, eh?

02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:00.440
Alright, cool. Good song.

02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.440
Well, it was a really good song. The steps could have been better.

02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:08.440
It's Dark Black Forest.

02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.440
Word. That would have been on my list.

02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:16.440
My number one song is not a tax song, nor is it Sakura.

02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:20.440
Gasp. Gasp.

02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:24.280
very interesting i've had that song on repeat for i'm surprised it wasn't

02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:27.720
burning heat i was expecting you to put burning heat you know as much as i love

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:31.960
burning heat and i actually crossed out soccer

02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:35.000
just because i can't i have to that's too cliche

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:39.000
she can't be that cliche i had to pick it on musical merit and as much as i

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.440
love burning heat i've gotten really tired of hearing

02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:48.200
burning heat i mean because like i went home after um i

02:44:48.200 --> 02:45:03.200
We showed Dan that video, the video for Burning Heat from 2DX, and he was freaking playing Gradius 2, and, you know, I love Gradius 2, I love Burning Heat, but 0-1 is just so much of a better song.

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:09.200
Alright. Fair enough. Did Power Expressing surprise the sacred and make the list?

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.200
Well, it's not really that good of a song.

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:15.200
Alright, alright, fair enough.

02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:19.840
It's the whole similarity between that and the Max 300.

02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.640
My pick, my number one choice and the last entry here on our list, I love this song,

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:28.880
it fucking rules, V35 is my number one choice.

02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:32.960
I love that song.

02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:36.720
Here is the list so far before we eliminate one from the list.

02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:44.040
War Game, Sound of Goodbye, Guideca, You Leave Me Alone, The Guitar Fricks Version Breakdown,

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:50.540
Van of the Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Dark Black Forest, Zero One, and B35.

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:20.040
Alright, those are things we're getting smacked for, so there you go.

02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:22.040
Smack them back with the sneaky trowel.

02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:24.040
Yeah, smack them back with our list, here we go.

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.040
Now we gotta eliminate, here we go. Black Lab, you're first.

02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:32.040
Okay, this is a tough one here.

02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:42.040
Let's see, between two songs on there, the one that I gotta take off, I just, I've heard it on the radio too much.

02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:48.040
And, frankly, I'm not too fond of it in 2DX either. It's the sound of goodbye, so I'm asking that.

02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:51.040
YouSuck.com. YouSuck.

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:59.040
Here we go already, starting to eliminate all of Loki's list. This seems to happen every week.

02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:08.040
I wish there was a ban against this group. Bye-bye, Breakdown. YouSuckass.

02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:10.040
But it's a good song!

02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.040
picking new songs. So, yeah.

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:46.040
Oh wow, Dark Black Forest goes bye bye, I'm actually really surprised.

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.040
Now, as tempting as it is to remove Vanity Angel because that was my

02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:54.040
impulse choice, I really, I can't do that to Loki, I can't,

02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:58.040
and there's another one here staring me in the face that I can't let on, be on

02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:02.040
this list because I think it's just overplayed and overrated, I'm getting rid of War Game.

02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:03.040
game.

02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:09.440
And Rob and I have come out of this unscathed.

02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:13.400
I wouldn't say that completely because two of those choices were on my list, and I replaced

02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:14.400
them with other things.

02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:20.440
So I think Jamie once again, Jamie, you have this tendency to come through the listless

02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:22.240
segments without any of your songs getting eliminated.

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.240
I told you, I have good taste.

02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:27.720
We have to plot against her one night and just take off all of her choices just to spider

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:28.720
her.

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:29.720
As I kick you in the head repeatedly.

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.720
People have worse taste than you do.

02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:36.720
That would be everybody in this room.

02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:37.720
Hey!

02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:38.720
Okay.

02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:40.720
I was trying to be funny.

02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:41.720
It worked.

02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:42.720
The end.

02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:44.720
Well, let's just get the vote on.

02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:46.720
Alright, let's get your vote on.

02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:48.720
Jamie, would you like to read this list one more time?

02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:52.720
Actually, I'm going to paste it in the chatroom, and then you can read it, and then people

02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:54.720
can start sending me their votes.

02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:55.720
Alright.

02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:56.720
Here it goes.

02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:03.720
Gudecca, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Rumor Twins, Another, Zero One, and V35.

02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:10.720
Best Bamani song of 2002? Might I point out, not a single one of those songs from Max 2.

02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:12.720
Not a single one.

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:14.720
Gasp! I almost put Sandstorm on there.

02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:15.720
Three.

02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:21.720
But it's overplayed, and the only reason I like Sandstorm is because of Children of the Sandstorm.

02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:28.720
Yeah, Children of the Sandstorm was good, but I have grown to hate Sandstorm now after hurting it six times in one day.

02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:35.720
I think, well, I don't think you were listening, but that one, a couple, like a week ago...

02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:38.720
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:45.720
Six times in one day, in different places, and I was going to kill myself by hurting it again.

02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:48.720
I heard the same thing happen to one of my happy hardcore picks.

02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:50.720
The picks from Happy To Be Hardcore.

02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:54.720
What song is it that I like?

02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:56.720
Like, the flowers need the rain.

02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:58.720
I need you, baby.

02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:00.720
No, I know which one it was.

02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:01.720
It was...

02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:02.720
Let the music play.

02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:03.720
It wasn't Innovate.

02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:04.720
It was one of the other ones.

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:05.720
I don't remember.

02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:06.720
Let Me Play.

02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.720
It was Let Me Play.

02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:08.720
But anyway.

02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:09.720
Start voting.

02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:10.720
Start voting.

02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:11.720
In the meantime, we're going to play something.

02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:12.720
I have a suggestion.

02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.720
Darktentia, he's pretty sad and pissy that we didn't put Rainbow Flyer on the list.

02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:20.300
So I thought maybe, since it's on the 2DX8-style soundtrack,

02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:21.800
there's a long version of Rainbow Flyer.

02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:22.960
Maybe we can play that?

02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:23.380
That's good for you.

02:50:23.380 --> 02:50:24.260
Just satisfy him.

02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:24.760
All right.

02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:28.660
We're going to play the long version of Rainbow Flyer.

02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:30.980
The long version Rainbow Flyer is kind of long.

02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:32.620
So I think, you know what?

02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:35.080
No, the long version Rainbow Flyer is a little bit too long,

02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:37.880
and it has Santa in it.

02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:38.800
I don't know.

02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:39.400
I like Santa.

02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:41.880
But actually, we're almost at the end of the show,

02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:43.520
so we've got to keep this break short.

02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:45.280
So we're going to play the short version of Rainbow Flyer,

02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:47.320
and we'll play the short version of Burning Heat.

02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:50.680
And we will come right back to finish this up, this show.

02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:53.960
Enjoy, send me your votes right now, now, now, now.

02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:49.520
We're back, and guess what?

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:53.080
We've had so many ties on our list tonight, this is a very hard one.

02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.080
This is like an everything tide.

02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:57.080
This is like an everything's tide.

02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:00.080
We want to take everybody's number two pick.

02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:04.080
So, send me your second choice, a second song you would vote for.

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:08.080
Here's the list one more time for your viewing pleasure in the chat room.

02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:10.080
And, Jamie, you want to read that one more time?

02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:15.080
Redeca, You Leave Me Alone, Fan of the Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence,

02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:19.080
Murmur Twins, Another, Zero, One, and Y35.

02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:20.080
V35.

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:21.080
That's okay.

02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:24.740
So everybody that's already voted send us your number two pick

02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:30.680
So we'll take your number two pick and add a vote for that and hopefully we'll be able to break the tie and get a

02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:31.920
winner in the meantime

02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:36.220
We're gonna play one more song that was suggested the best momani song of 2002

02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:40.160
However, it wasn't released in 2002, but just because we're funny

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:45.580
Huh, we're going to play it. Anyway. Oh look Loki sleeping

02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:52.580
Okay, he's just resting his eyes. Okay, here it is. Enjoy.

02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:41.300
You are so sweet and I'm gonna hit you You're the one, you're the one that I need

02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.300
Oh yeah, yeah, they do to me

02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:45.300
I'm easy, I'm easily

02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:47.300
They look like they want you back

02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:49.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all night I want you

02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:51.300
And you know I know I'm

02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:53.300
I'm ready to go

02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.300
Oh Nicki's not your baby

02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:57.300
You know I won't admit

02:56:57.300 --> 02:56:59.300
I'ma be like in heaven

02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:01.300
Just like in heaven

02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:03.300
Oh Nicki loves to be

02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:05.300

Goodnight, Nicky

02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:16.700
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:29.340
to the music. You're listening to Orange Lounge. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. I forget how to

02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:31.340
Whoop!

02:59:31.340 --> 02:59:35.340
I forget how to set that thing to do this.

02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:36.340
Rayvar.

02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:37.340
Turn off lights and do that.

02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:38.340
It's pretty cool.

02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:39.340
Rayvar.

02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:44.340
Anyway, here we are, back with the list.

02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:46.340
Uh, Loki.

02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:48.340
Loki, you're going to read this list for us.

02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:55.340
Tell our listening public what came in third place for the Best Bomani Song of 2002.

02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:59.340
3rd place was Vanity Angel from Euro Mix 2.

02:59:59.340 --> 03:00:02.340
Woooooot!

03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:04.340
Black Lab wanted to delete that too.

03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:07.340
2nd best Beymani song of 2002.

03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:10.340
Gravity from 7th Style?

03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:12.340
Yep, 7th Style. Woot.

03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:17.340
And this is very surprising to me, but it did win by quite a few votes.

03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:20.340
It was most people's 2nd pick. I was a little surprised at this.

03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:22.340
So it got a lot of tiebreak votes.

03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:24.340
The number 1 Beymani song of 2002.

03:00:24.340 --> 03:00:30.440
me alone from DDR USA or Max USA. Not USA. Not DDR USA.

03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:34.020
So You Leave Me Alone, the number one balani song in 2002, what do you guys think of that?

03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:37.060
I disagree. I totally disagree. But it's cool.

03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:42.260
It's all about Kachaka. Zero one.

03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:45.860
War Gang got erased. I'm sorry. Did I do that?

03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:50.580
Well guess what guys? It's the end of the show. We're pretty much, we're wrapping up.

03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:51.700
We are all out of show.

03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:53.380
Oh no, we out of show.

03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:58.700
So um, I guess now is the point where I ask everybody, what is your final thought of the

03:00:58.700 --> 03:00:59.700
day?

03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:03.300
Jamie, what is your final thought of the day?

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:06.220
I want one of those Rayvar light thingies.

03:01:06.220 --> 03:01:07.620
You want a Rayvar light?

03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:10.420
Maybe for Christmas, Jamie, I will find you a Rayvar light.

03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:11.820
Um, okay.

03:01:11.820 --> 03:01:12.820
Okay.

03:01:12.820 --> 03:01:13.820
Loki?

03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:14.820
Actually, I know what I want.

03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:15.820
Black Lab, your final thought of the day.

03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:16.820
No, no, there's something else I want.

03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:17.820
Oh, sorry.

03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:18.820
Sorry?

03:01:18.820 --> 03:01:21.820
I want the leather-bound hardcover copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales.

03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:22.820
Leather.

03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:29.820
Oh yes, Black Lab, are you done? I'm sorry?

03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:30.820
Uh, yeah.

03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:33.820
Okay, Black Lab, your final thought of the day?

03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:38.820
Final thoughts, I'm coming out of my chocolate high now. Yay.

03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:47.820
Um, now I get to sleep and then wake up at 7am and drive home.

03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:50.820
Okay, that's it?

03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:51.820
I think that's it for him.

03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:53.820
And my final thought is,

03:01:53.820 --> 03:01:56.820
Oh! This is my favorite show!

03:01:56.820 --> 03:01:58.320
This is my favorite show!

03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:01.820
It's my favorite shoe!

03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:03.820
He's thinking it's a fortune cookie, or something.

03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:05.820
No we have a fortune cookie.

03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:06.820
We already have a fortune cookie.

03:02:06.820 --> 03:02:07.820
Dedicated to the Holidays.

03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:08.820
Dedicated to Holidays.

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:11.820
Uh, my final thought of the day is, um,

03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:14.820
Lord of the Rings was very big.

03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:16.820
Very, very big.

03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:19.820
First of all, Lord of the Rings is the name of the trilogy.

03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:23.820
The Two Towers was very big.

03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:25.820
Now the whole trilogy, I would agree, is very big.

03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:29.820
Yes, that's what I meant. The whole trilogy is very big.

03:02:29.820 --> 03:02:32.820
Or the Rings Part 2, the quest for more money.

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:34.820
That's baseball's part two.

03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:35.820
Word.

03:02:35.820 --> 03:02:40.820
And I guess the only other final thought I can think of to...

03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:42.820
Oh, you do, Jamie?

03:02:42.820 --> 03:02:44.820
Yeah, I actually have one more. It's a realization.

03:02:44.820 --> 03:03:00.820
Anybody who's ever a Mel Brooks fan, anyone ever noticed that this song at the end of History of the World Part 1, the Jews in Space song, is the exact same tune that was used in Robin Hood Men in Tights for the Men in Tights song?

03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:02.820
I did not know that.

03:03:02.820 --> 03:03:04.820
It's the same tune?

03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:06.820
The Jews in Space, is that it?

03:03:06.820 --> 03:03:11.820
Yeah, but it's the same tune as the Men in Tights song.

03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:13.820
Fascinating.

03:03:13.820 --> 03:03:20.820
I thought of one more thing to say, Zing.

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:23.820
Word!

03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:25.820
Good night.

03:03:25.820 --> 03:03:29.820
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:33.820
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:41.820
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:45.820
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:48.820
Okay children, gather around.

03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:52.820
Now since Eric Cartman can't seem to remember the words to Oh Holy Night,

03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:54.820
we're going to use a little shock therapy.

03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:57.820
I'm going to give one of you children this cattle prod,

03:03:57.820 --> 03:04:00.820
and if Eric forgets any words, just shock him a little, okay?

03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:02.820
Who wants the prod?

03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:04.820
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:06.820
Here you go Kyle, why don't you take it?

03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:07.820
Sweet!

03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:09.820
Okay Eric, whenever you're ready.

03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:16.820
Hey! What was that for? I didn't screw up!

03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:20.820
No, Kyle, you can't shock him unless he forgets the words.

03:04:20.820 --> 03:04:22.820
Sorry, Mr. Garrison.

03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:38.820
Oh, how we know the stars are brightly shining It is the day of our dear Savior's day

03:04:38.820 --> 03:04:43.820
Oh, how in the...

03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:46.820
Jesus!

03:04:46.820 --> 03:05:02.820
Jesus was born, and so we give praise.

03:05:02.820 --> 03:05:26.820
Singing

03:05:26.820 --> 03:05:40.820
I remember that whole chorus didn't even have to...

03:05:40.820 --> 03:05:41.820
Mystic!

03:05:41.820 --> 03:06:06.340
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
