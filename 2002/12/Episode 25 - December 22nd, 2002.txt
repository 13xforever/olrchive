Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gay?
Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.
It's Kendo.
Hey!
DarkSakura.
Shut up!
Where's my gun?
This is my boomstick.
Sky.
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.
Loki.
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live, and this is episode number 25 for December the 22nd of 2002.
You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most old-school station, as judged by the pre-show, correct?
Of all things bee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
Joining me as always are the other two pieces of the pie.
Say hello to the apple pie in that corner, Jamie.
The bunny pie.
Apple?
I don't know, what pie would you be?
Mincemeat.
Mincemeat pie.
And then that corner, the, I don't know, the Judging By His Christmas Present, he'd be the sugar pie.
Say hello to Loki.
Hey, buddy.
And also joining us tonight, the one, the only, you know him, you love him or you hate him, I don't know.
It's Black Lab.
All right.
I know, we got that stupid humming noise back tonight, I can't figure out what's going on.
I think I need to do a reboot, but I can't do the reboot in the middle of a show, so I don't know what to do.
We'll figure out if we can figure out what's going on, and we'll be back in a little bit.
But first I gotta queue up a song, so what do you guys want to talk about tonight?
What are we talking about tonight on the big show?
We just literally ran in here a little bit ago, so we're still kind of...
What is it with Maxim Magazine hating Canada?
They just, like, rip on Canada every page.
They really do.
It's weird.
We gotta talk about Christmas and all that fun stuff.
Christmas sucks.
Christmas is sucks.
Go Yule.
Uh, so...
We're going to play something from the brand new 8th style soundtrack.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
It sounds squealicious.
Okay, we're going to play the radical mix of Abstract.
This song's pretty cool.
Good, this doesn't suck.
Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.
Thanks for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Tonight is very... Damn, we don't got no one listening tonight.
We're very low on the listeners and people in the chat room and all that stuff.
I guess the holidays really do fuck everything up, don't they?
Either that or people forgot about us.
Sniff, I cry.
Well, tell a friend, tell a relative, tell everyone that Orange Lounge Radio is on the air and we love new listeners, so yeah.
Anyway, we have candy and cookies.
Yes, we have lots of yum eats today.
This is going to be one of those shows.
It's probably a good thing no one's listening.
Well, actually, it's probably going to wait.
Just wait like a half an hour once all the sugar kicks in.
Once all the sugar kicks in, this show's going to be crazy.
Then we'll be buzzing around the room like flies.
We do have plenty of stuff on the agenda tonight.
We're going to do another rendition of Orange Lounge Match Game pretty soon.
That'll be fun.
Yay.
And we're going to do... Our list list tonight will be the best Bomani song of 2002.
So that'll be fun.
Woohoo!
And just kind of some other year-end junk to talk about today.
I don't know, how are we going to start this big show off?
We want to do the FUs of the week?
We want to do the sim updates?
We can talk about anything that's in this Maxim magazine.
Why don't we talk about Loki's Christmas present from Jamie?
Let's talk about that.
I gave him the gift of cleavage.
I got a Maxim magazine and I got a bunch of chocolate.
A whole bunch of chocolate.
Like tons and tons and tons and tons of chocolate.
But no nuts.
No nuts, because I hate nuts.
But, um...
I'm a good present giver because I remember.
But this book is awesome.
I mean, it's got, well, other than the fact that it's got this really cool page with this topless cheerleader that's just, oh my god.
That's what I want next year, okay?
Right there.
Um, let's see, it tells, they have a page here, how to amputate your own limb.
How?
Uh, what other, how to date a cheerleader, how to make a turducken, or whatever that is, I don't know.
How to play craps.
It's just awesome.
How to deck your lawn.
You know, crazy stuff like that.
Speaking of Maxim Magazine, don't you have an announcement to make about your little competition?
Oh yeah, due to the fact that our wonderful message board went down again, I am postponing the due date by two weeks.
For what?
For MakeEditGetPorned.
Winner is you.
Why don't you explain one more time, even though no one new is listening tonight, I'm sure because our listener count is so low.
Tell us all about MakeEditGetPorn.
MakeEditGetPorn is basically you make an edit for any song that's on DDR Max USA, and you send it to me some way, either it be a DexDrive save, a DWI file, a step chart, whatever.
You just send it to me, and you're entered.
The winner gets a big box of porn.
That's pretty much it.
So basically, you make an edit and you get some porn.
Maybe.
But you have to win to get the porn.
You have to win to get the porn.
You get a lot of porn.
As things look right now, there's like two people entered.
Which is another reason, another thing that prompted me to push back the deadline by two weeks.
But yeah, so that's pretty much the contest right there.
As it stands, VidPower has a suggestion.
He says it shouldn't be merp, make, edit, receive porn.
Because then he can say merp.
Why do we have to drop everything down to acronyms?
F you to acronyms, okay?
Anyways, so... Yeah, that means futa.
Page 100, the acronym show, you mean TASP?
Dude, they have nude elves in here.
Nude elves?
What?
Wait, what is this?
Why are there... I don't... Okay.
That's pretty cool.
Maxim Magazine is such a dirty little rag.
I love it.
Surprise.
Yeah.
Stretch.
Yeah, they have stuff about video games.
What's the video game that they reviewed this week?
Nightfire.
Nightfire.
They gave it four out of five stars.
James Bond.
Yeah, it's like Goldeneye.
Okay, you want to fuss?
Jamie wants to fuss.
I want to fuss.
Jamie wants to fuss.
Fuss about something.
Are we doing FUs already?
This isn't the FUs?
This isn't an FU, but I need fussy music.
You need fussy music?
Whoa, look, balls.
This guy is holding bread together to where it looks like balls in that big cock.
What fussy music do you want?
You want your normal FU music?
Um, no.
What's your fussy music?
Gravity.
You want gravity for your fussy music, okay.
Yeah, I need tack.
Let's see if I can find fussy music.
Fussy, fussy, fussy.
Okay.
What the hell?
She's a hoe.
Okay, here we go.
I have your fussy music.
She likes being beaten when she has sex.
Okay.
Today we went to Roseville Golf Land.
And boy did it suck.
We went over there to play some Parapara and some stuff.
And I just got so sick of all the machines being down that I went and fussed the manager.
His name...
with a list at all.
I have a... No, I made the list after I fussed with him.
Oh, wow.
Well, you can do it again.
His name was Chris.
He's a tall guy.
He's a tall guy.
And he was wearing a vest over one of those button-up golf lid shirts.
I went and I fussed with him.
I said... Excuse me, I'm trying to fuss.
Anyway...
I asked why the machines were in poor repair.
And I named off machines one by one and what was wrong with them.
And his eyes just got a little bit wider and a little bit wider.
And he decides to use this condescending corporate talk.
Okay, I worked for a corporation for two years and I'm working for another one now.
Although that's not quite as professional, I should say.
Hooray, corporation.
Anyway, he was like, well, I'm sorry you feel that way, and blah, blah, blah.
And the tech comes in on Monday.
I'm like, hire another tech.
What, the tech?
Yeah.
I remember hearing they have three techs at Rosemont.
You said the tech, the D tech.
Well, apparently, they must have three techs, and they all come in the same day and just drink beers and watch football.
Is that true?
Oh, yeah, I was about to say that.
Anyway.
I was like, well, then hire another.
And he's like, well, corporate deals, blah, blah.
I'm like, okay, if all of your funding comes from your corporate office.
Tell corporate to suck your corporate cock.
I don't have a, anyway.
Eat your corporate clit then, I don't care.
Anyway, I was like, well then explain why I haven't noticed this many machines down at SVGL.
Or I haven't seen this many machines down at MGL.
CVGL!
I started naming off places.
I'm like, you know, if all your funding comes from Gothland Corporate, why are these other Gothlands in such good repair and this one has so many broken machines?
Well, I don't know.
I'm like, you know what?
I'm like, if we don't see some improvement here, there might be an organized boycott of your facility.
Oh yeah, but I probably wouldn't go anyways.
I walked off, took out my notebook, and proceeded to write down all of the machines that were broken.
I have a list, but I'll leave my list after.
I have a silly comment, but Black Lab used to work for the Golf Line, right?
The Golf Line Empire.
I was just wondering what your manager would have done had Jamie came in and said, lick my corporate clit.
Okay, first of all, my...
First of all... Who would have said that?
Well, first of all, my manager was Mormon, so... Yeah, that would have just made the situation all the more awkward.
I didn't question anything.
You were nice.
Yeah, but a constructive argument for my manager would have actually produced some kind of result.
I mean, but... Then again, Capture Valley is like a fifth the size of Roseville.
No water slides or go-karts like there are on Earth, but anyways...
What are you looking at now in this fax?
Oh my god, it's the Rapture!
What is... I know about these.
Okay, time to... I think she's kind of fussing about the pictures.
Dude, you just turned red.
Okay, cut.
Yeah, Rob's complaining about things already going on a train wreck.
This is what's broken right now at Roseville Golf Land.
By the way, they had a really crappy service today.
Anyway, um, hip hop...
What's new today?
These were just the obviously broken things.
Okay, I didn't go by and personally test every game.
But first of all, the Hip Hop Mania, it eats tokens.
I lost two dollars in tokens on that thing today.
They wouldn't give it to me.
Okay, Guitar Freaks was down.
Um... Drum Media was put out of order because the drumsticks weren't tied to the machine, but I just took the sticker off and just played it anyways.
DDR4th Mix was down.
However, they were turning it on when we were leaving.
I think someone switched right there for a second.
Um, uh, DDR Max 2, um, you said the left player up arrow was broken and the right player right arrow was broken.
Other way around.
Oh, okay.
First player up there, I was the second player.
That's what I'm saying.
And Potapota has one of the sensors on there that's a little bit loose.
For the Medieval Madness, Pinball is down.
Roadshow Pinball is down.
Revenge for Mars Pinball is down.
Time Crisis Clare 1 is down.
The Grid was down.
They had it all taken apart.
They had like separated like one at each corner of the Arcade or something.
Radical Biker is down.
Radical Biker?
That's the only game that's not working in the UDL.
I'm just naming all of them.
And it's like, it never works.
Um, that game War, the third player was down.
Germania 7 has an unresponsive cymbal.
Um, I'm finished with what came back with, uh, Loose.
Not working properly.
I'll just say the first player's fine.
Keyboard Mania, player one, um, the wheel was broken.
The wheel was the first player's fine?
It was working fine when I was playing it.
It's been broken for a while.
It's a little bit twitchy.
Don't let this happen to you.
So how many games is this that I've named?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 games.
I'd like to announce also that their ticket counting machine is inaccurate.
It in fact counts less tickets than you put in there, no matter what you do, because the retards don't empty it.
You sound like the comic book guy.
I would like to point out that that chicken machine is inaccurate.
Worst.
Episode.
Ever.
You know what, this?
Possibly, yes.
No, no.
We rule.
Any other?
Worst episode ever was me doing it live from freaking the tournament.
That was the worst.
And stop it.
I'm closing now.
Anyway, this is what I'm planning on doing, so I hope that all of our listeners see what Rose spoke off as.
Oh, a plan.
P-L-A-N.
That's not an acronym.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie has a plan.
Thank you.
No, we need the fanfare from Ron Campbell.
Anyway, the plan is this.
We've tried petitioning them before, you know, sending letters.
We only sent in a few letters, so this is what I'm going to say.
For everybody who has a complaint regarding Roseville Gothland, if you want to see some changes going, you know, there's supposed to be power in numbers.
I'm going to send a letter to Gothland Corporate.
to complain about the shoddy performance of Roseville Gothland.
I'm going to send it to Steve Boss.
Yes, Steve Rogers was his name, who is the general manager of Roseville Gothland.
Also, you know, the fact that he was so unresponsive during the whole time we were trying to get our tournament running.
I'm sending a letter to the Gothland corporate, fussing about him.
I'm surprised.
I thought something would be shaken up there.
I heard that Shiggle Boss went up there, checked the place out earlier, like last week sometime.
Like to help with the tour or something.
There needs to be more than just that.
I'm even wanting to enlist the aid of anyone with a good digital camera to go take pictures of the machines.
Nearly 7 out of 10 women say that they're unhappy with the size of their lowest penis.
Loki, shut up for a minute.
Back some time later.
Last time we did that, took a digital camera and took pictures, and we put them up on the internet.
They were pissed.
They were so pissed.
We'll do it again.
Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.
Take your pictures this time.
And you know, we had a thread on that open on DDR Freak for six weeks with links to those pictures.
Can I be in the picture with a sad face?
Yes.
And you know what?
We should photoshop Captain Jack into a picture and have him crying.
You know what?
Am I not incorrect that it worked last time?
Yes, yes it did.
We had our keyboards replaced on Keyboard Mania?
Yes, it did.
So you know what?
Let's do it.
Let's go ahead in there.
And, uh...
You know, there's something, I don't know if anyone has ever worked in customer service or in any type of service where they've given, you know, training classes like that, but for every eight displeased customers, only one person ever does something about it.
That's sad.
And the thing about this, each of the people that are displeased with the service are going to go and tell another eight people, at least, and spread the word.
I would just like to point out that I used Jamie's example in a training class the other day at work.
You did?
That's cool.
But
See, that's the point.
You need to think that for every single complaint letter you get, there are seven other people who are pissed off at your company.
You know, you see what we're going to do?
We're going to make sure there's quite a few more than just eight.
And to point out, Orange Lounge Radio, we're an international show.
We've got listeners in Japan, listeners in Canada, all over.
Our world headquarters is Sacramento, California, so this is kind of a local topic.
But even the people, we've got some folks in Vegas in the chat room right now.
VidPower says, I feel sorry for you guys and our cage should not be messed up that bad.
Yes, we bitch about RBGL because we want your pity.
That's the point.
Well, on top of that though, we're making a point for anybody else, you know, around the world and country.
If you see your arcade or any place that you frequent that's in poor condition, do something about it.
Just say, oh god, this sucks.
and not doing anything about it, is that people don't know what they're doing wrong until you tell them.
Just keep in mind that the vast majority of people in this world are feminists.
They're stupid.
I'm not saying everybody is stupid.
I'm not saying everybody is stupid because obviously our listeners have a brain.
but you know there are a lot of really dumb people in the world and they just don't get it and they keep doing something thinking that they're doing something the right way and in the meantime they don't know just how bad they're fucking up especially if your arcade smells like pee
That would be Laser Force.
I swear, I smelled fish while I was playing DDR at Roseville today.
Me too, I smelled fish.
I was like, dang, somebody needs to douche.
It was nasty.
It distracted me when I was trying to play.
It was sick.
Golfland is filled with the rag smell of pussy and I don't like it.
At least no little kid came and took a dump by you while you were playing.
Oh, you didn't have to see someone trying to change your baby's diaper on the keyboard, maybe.
I have a little horror story about Golf of Heaven.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, when I was working at Castle Quest at CBGL over the summer, some little kid...
I think it was around Labor Day weekend, we were trying to fix some air conditioning on the roof, and all of a sudden I walk over to the edge of the roof to check around to make sure there's no little kids running around, and I see this little brown pile sitting on the sidewalk out in front of the Arcane.
I'm like, that can't be from a dog or something, can it?
And then I get a complaint from my bosses like,
Ryan, the toilet's clogged, could you go take care of that?
So I go walking over to the bathroom, I look at the toilet, and there's a little kid's pair of boxers filled with crap sitting in the toilet.
There's like a half a roll of toilet paper crammed in there with, like somebody tried to flush the boxers down the toilet.
How stupid can you get?
No, I had to...
And then I walked outside and there was like little trails of drops of crap laying on the sidewalk.
Up to this big pile over by one of the starts of the golf courses.
I had to clean that up.
It was nasty.
I don't think I need any more chocolates tonight.
Thank you.
Well, maybe they won't keep you aside for that.
That's a good thing.
Okay, Santa's getting some.
We're looking in the... That damn Maxim again!
Read the quote.
And here's a candy cane for you.
It's a picture of Santa and some woman on his lap with her underwear.
Is this like a shot of Santa sitting from the knees down and then some other particular... Let's hear it for Maxim.
Anyway, so back to what my point was.
If anybody, it doesn't even matter what it is.
People don't know what they're doing wrong until you point it out to them.
Make sure that if you're going to complain about something, you do it in a constructive manner.
You point out item by item what is wrong with what they're doing, how you think it can be fixed, and then you send it to the people who can do something about it.
Don't give it to some peon because they're going to lose it.
Which means go over everyone's heads until you get to the top.
Go as far as you need to
Loki will give you a little quote from it.
They're talking about, like, Santa's new album, The Ho-Zone, and it claims it was the first single, Get in the Sleigh, Bitch.
Yeah.
And that gets the, okay, whatever, it'll be a week.
Anyway.
I think now's a good time to go to break.
What do you think?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
I don't know if you guys heard the news, but I remember last week we were talking about DDR Extreme and the rumor that it was coming out on Christmas Day.
And I said, what a bunch of bullshit.
Ah, you were wrong.
Whoops.
My bad.
It is coming out on Christmas Day according to the Konami official website.
So, okay.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
How are you?
I am good.
Hi, Amanda.
Say hello, Amanda.
Hi, I'm Amanda.
And this is Yana.
Say hello.
Hello.
And they've come to visit us.
Now, Amanda, you're a big DDR fan, right?
I guess so.
Do you still even play anymore?
Um...
I think the last time I played... Actually, no, wait, did we... I played once, like, that's the last time I came over here.
I went and played, like, once at Q's R on a fourth.
Well, where did you used to play?
Tell us about some of the folks that you used to play DDR with and when you got started and all of that.
Um, started off at Mountain Mike's, because that was, like, the only machine in the area.
Well, actually, that's when I really, really started it.
Machine got really crappy, so we stopped playing.
Then we got a seventh mix, so everyone was there.
And then...
My work schedule got busy, so I stopped.
What is this you show?
Shame on you.
They're not, no, they're, no.
I know, I know, they're perfectly legal.
I've seen those things before, but.
They're just natural, they're just natural cigarettes.
What does this say?
Let's see.
It's just the brand name.
Can I say over the air what these are?
Yeah.
They're ecstasy cigarettes.
It's just the brand name.
It doesn't have anything to do with the company.
It doesn't have anything to do with going to the rave.
No, it has nothing to do with MDMA, no.
Let's see, let's read the ingredients.
Damiana, wild lettuce, catnip.
Dude, catnip!
Let's go smoke some catnip!
And passionflower, mint, love and light.
Damiana, I used to work at GNC for two years.
Damiana makes you horny.
Very, very, very important.
We used to sell it to old men who couldn't get it up.
Herbal Viagra.
Inhale.
So, yeah.
Yeah, you do realize you've walked in on a DDR talk show, correct?
Yes.
Why don't I have the greatest idea?
Oh, remember at the bowling alley that had the really crappy third mix?
Uh-huh.
My friend who works there pretty much got on the guy and says, look, you know what?
The reason this machine isn't making money is because it's crap.
You don't keep it up.
And basically, she just basically told him like it was.
There's a seventh mix there now.
Pretty much the bowlers before were complaining about everyone like stomping on it, it was interfering with their game.
Right.
And now, because it's pads work, you don't have to stomp as hard, and the thing that they're complaining about mostly is the music now, so they just kind of turn it down, but it's still playable.
It's funny that you mention that, because in the last segment, Jamie was just talking about Roseville Golf Land, how a lot of their games have gone to shit, and how she was going to write a boycott letter to the management, the high, high, high management, like corporate.
Nice.
God.
Yes, God of Golf Land, so it's funny that you bring that up.
So, wow.
So, what else is going on?
I don't know.
What's new in the world of Amanda that she can talk about on the radio?
Did you meet Ryan in the front room?
That's Black Lab.
I don't know.
He's online, dude.
Is that the one who answered the door?
Yeah, probably.
He's kind of looking at me weird like, uh... Who the hell are you?
He's like looking at us like, what the hell?
Evil Women trying to take over the house.
I love that CD.
I love this CD.
What, Frow Frow?
I love Frow Frow.
We've been talking about Frow Frow last week on the show.
We'll talk more during break.
Whatever.
I call it Frow Frow.
I'm probably wrong, though.
I thought, you know what might be fun?
Why don't you guys, why don't you guys play match game with us?
We're going to do a match game segment.
Why don't you guys play with us?
Okay.
You guys can be special celebrity guests.
Yana's crazy.
She's taking this Toffafay thing.
She's got this, what's your little toffee?
It's a little, describe what Toffafay is, Jamie.
I don't know how to explain it.
I'm eating it right now.
It's got like a hazelnut and it's got like noughts.
It's really, really delicious, so I have to put it on my nipple so you can lick it off.
Yana's putting this Top of Pay on her nipple.
Hazelnut and caramel and chocolate hazelnut filling.
Can I lick that when it's on your nipple?
Can I lick that when it's on your nipple?
Rob, step off my girl.
I licked a Top of Pay nipple.
Okay.
You know, TV in here is going to be like, you know, kind of like a 30s show now.
Oh, now.
I've seen it once before.
and to our three hour trainwreck.
Okay.
Um, yeah, so, when to do match, we gotta get Ryan for a match game, though.
Now, a three hour trainwreck, that just reminds me of, like, Austin Powers.
No!
Oh, this is great.
Exo Saga, like Pedro.
No!
We got in the chatroom, DSCS SoCalKicks is ranting because we've got lesbians in the house and the webcam's not on.
Well, doesn't it suck to be you?
Honey, we still have our clothes on, so you're not missing too much.
I'm taking off my shirt.
Ooh, baby.
Hey, should we just, like, make out just to make him jealous?
She's going to be wearing nothing but Toffa Fae.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
They're going to make out in studio.
No, it's Del Taco.
Del Taco's trying to eat its way out of my stomach.
It's trying to...
No, it's trying to breach, just, you know.
Okay, wait a minute.
You're asking if a Maxim magazine belongs to me.
Hello, I know we don't talk about those facts much on the show, but that's not my preferred reading material, got it?
I actually have a friend who has it as well, and he basically, let's just put it this way.
He got himself a subscription to XY, and for his birthday his dad got him a subscription to Playboy.
Just so happened that one day they both came in the mailbox on the same day.
Wacky.
Crazy.
Wild stuff.
I think we're getting a phone call.
We're not getting a phone call, but our friend here in the house is getting a phone call.
I don't know what's going on.
I've lost total and absolute control of this show.
Hey, Amanda, did you hear there's a new DDR coming out?
DDR Extreme on Christmas Day in Japan?
You have this total unenthused look on your face.
Well, they'll have it here in about a couple weeks.
I'm sure they'll get the game from Japan.
It's got Butterfly on it!
Apple...
This show's gone.
You're all nuts right about now.
Hi.
Some of us do have nuts and some of us don't.
Yeah, I know nuts aren't your preferred... Well, you know, like, men are like a box of chocolates.
You never know which one has nuts.
Oh, my lord.
Okay.
What is a match?
What is the match game?
I want to do a match game, but we've got to have our own... Dude, it's got pictures of those guys pulling a truck with their cocks.
Sweet.
What?
What?
Ah!
That's how they get their things a little bit more... Oh, my God.
Okay, long dong.
Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani, Talk, and Then Some, and this would be the Then Some portion of that.
Well...
We were talking about what Hooker's two weeks ago.
Yeah, wait, hold on.
Take the mic, Amanda.
I gotta go figure out what's going on with the other guests.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hi.
Who's that?
This is Jason Schwartzman, better known as the guy that was in Rushmore and also was in that other movie that I didn't like.
Two movies I probably haven't seen.
Uh-oh, we have family issues, totally.
I just got shushed.
Let me catch Black Lab up on where we've been.
Black Lab, while you were out playing 2DX, we had some from the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
Amanda and Yana came into the house, so I'm getting the finger right now.
And I bet you'll be getting the finger later.
Actually, I think Damien's going to be home today, so... You know, if it wasn't actually for that finger, I'd still be a virgin.
Yeah, I just walked into the room and I'm like...
You're turning pink.
It's so cute, he's fleshy.
I'm just trying not to laugh so hard right now.
Plus the sugar's kicking in.
I don't know how many of us like to remember about the vibrators and everything.
I wanted to go to San Francisco to get one.
That's just sickening, okay?
I don't know if that's the chocolate, if it was that or the chocolate just came out to make a puke, I don't know.
Whether it got used or not, it would just be a thing that would be cool to have.
Just put it on display, that's all you need it for.
I don't know, man.
It's all.
These, like, religious dildos look pretty funny.
You get the little Buddha, Buddha with, like, testicles for some reason, and then the, you know, crucifix dildo.
Oh, yeah.
Any, any way.
We are...
Do you feel the power?
I think we're going to take a quick break to regroup.
It's going to be really quick.
We're just going to do like a one song break.
What do you want to play?
It's on the CD.
Okay.
He's whipping out a CD, ladies and gentlemen.
Dead air.
Dead air, dead air.
Okay.
This song that we're going to be playing is from CKY.
It's the Chinese Freestyle Rack.
Oh!
So, it's pretty sweet.
You guys will love it.
Where is it?
It's right there.
Right.
Oh, okay.
Alright, here we go.
We're going to do the CKY Chinese Freestyle Rap.
And in the meantime, we need some contestants for Match Game, because we're going to do that right when we get back.
But first, we need a trivia question.
You want to offer up a trivia question for the chatters, Jamie?
On how we're going to get people?
Um...
We've got to make it kind of simple, but not too hard.
Something simple, but not too hard?
Something not too easy.
Okay, what was...
Alright, V from Beatmania 2DX, what was the original song and who composed it?
Ah, okay, so V from 2DX, who was the original composer and the name of the original song?
Yes.
Yes, okay, so just message that to me in the chat room.
And you get bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.
Yes, bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.
So first two people to get in on that, we'll be playing match game with all of us, all six of us in house right now.
So we'll be right back.
Who wants to taste my general style?
You want to taste my general style?
I'm going to give it to you now.
Who likes my chopsticks?
Hit you in the shit with my little lipstick.
Yellow, if you want to see me eat yellow.

I can kick you higher than you can kick me.
I can kick you way up into my tree.

Ha, I know what you mean, ha ha ha, huh?
Oh, hi, we have dead air.
Hold on.
I have to bring us back with a promo, though.
Well, okay, we'll play one more song, then we'll come back.
How about this as a promo?
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or die.
Okay, welcome back.
We've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
All right, we're going to kick your ass.
And we have our two contestants for...
Thank you for watching!
There's going to be four questions for Match Game, unless I can think of more.
Hello to DDR Angel.
She woke up.
She's saying hello.
I know.
I was counting you as a regular, dear.
Because you're a regular.
Yeah, you're a regular, dear.
And DDR Angel's planning on being in the house in a couple weeks, by the way.
Better to be regular than irregular.
DDR Angel and Stresa are going to be here in a couple weeks.
That's good.
I think you, right?
Maybe not.
Maybe, maybe not.
I discussed this with her.
It's a two-hour drive each way, so that'd be a total of eight hours driving on my part.
We'll work something out.
We'll figure something out.
We'll figure something out.
We'll work it out somehow.
But one eight-hour drive we're going to be making, you and me, Loki, this weekend.
We're going to SoCal.
We're going to SoCal!
And we're going to hopefully meet some of our regulars down there and get some interviews, because SoCal Kicks is foaming at the mouth wanting to get on the show, so we've got to go interview him at some point.
Jamie, unfortunately, I have a cry because she has to work.
She's not going to be able to make it.
I'm going to be marathoning on to me.
Well, that's cool.
You never know during the middle of whatever we have planned.
Somebody's cable might start working again.
That's right.
That goes back to the five keys of the week.
If you enjoy the fuck-off shows that's happened here in the past, guess what?
It's about to get twice as big.
The fucks are going to get twice as big from Jamie, because you know how angsty she can be.
Okay, alright.
Here we go.
We're going to play some DDR match game.
DDR match game.
So, we have our contestants.
Who's our contestants today?
Our contestants today are VidPowa from Vegas.
I'm very impressed.
He got the bonus question, too.
He got the bonus question, so he gets a cookie.
And nobody else got the answer to the question.
Which, by the way, what was the answer?
The answer was Vivaldi, Winter from the Four Seasons.
Yay!
And SoCalKicks, he didn't know that one, but he knew Kakumei, so we let him in anyway, because nobody else decided.
But because it was Revolution by Gershwin.
Was that Gershwin?
Anyway.
I took Music Theory, and I was in the band.
I was...
So, here we go, we're going to play some match games, some Orange Lounge Radio match game.
Now, the way this works is, I'm trying to find the music right now, actually.
Oh, here it is.
We have to explain for our new folks in studio how to play this game, because I don't think they've played match games before.
Well, basically, we've got phrases.
And on these phrases, we have a blank on these phrases.
Basically, it's like, I went to the mall and bought a blank.
Dildo, Hello Kitty Vibrator
You and I don't go to the same mall.
Unless you're in Vegas.
They have ones that glow in the dark.
Like, you really want to see the inside.
Dude, I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to buy hair dye, and they had these things called hand massagers, and they looked like vibrators.
It's like those little figure massagers you see in commercials before.
No, no, this one was dildo-y.
Hand massager with dildo attachment.
And they were selling them for $3 at Sally's Beauty Supply.
I'm going to make you holla.
You know, you know.
Okay, yeah, it's time to start.
So we got our two contestants.
Now, contestants, when you have an answer to fill in the blank with, you're going to message those to me over private message.
And the rest of you in the chat room that aren't playing, you can still participate.
You can send your suggestions through the chat room, through the main chat room.
So go ahead and send those to us.
So here we go.
We're going to start, and all six of us are celebrities.
But first, we're going to have to introduce our lovely celebrities here on Orange Lounge Match Game.
Insert chord music here.
Alright.
First celebrity up.
You know her and love her.
One day she's going to get married to Tack in the middle of the ocean somewhere.
Say hello to DarkSakura.
Alright, next up, our next celebrity.
He has the biggest pornography collection in all of Sacramento.
Say hello to Loki.
I don't have the largest.
You don't have the largest?
No, I don't have the largest.
How about third largest?
Next up, he likes the dogs more than he likes the pussies.
Say hello to Black Lab.
Yeah, I don't know why I didn't see that one coming.
Next up, she's wearing an orange shirt in spirit of this, and she'll be appearing next in the short film World's Biggest Gangbang Part 69.
No, I'm kidding, I don't know.
Say hello to Amanda.
Hi.
And next up... You're mean, Rob.
I know, I know, that's what I do on this show.
And last up, you've seen her working at your local 24-hour...
Sensual Shop.
Say hello to Yana!
Hello!
Alright, those are our lovely celebrities today.
I just had an idea.
I think we should have like a little counter or something for every time there's a reference to the porn.
You can like talk up the counter and we'll see what the highest number is by the end of the show.
Like you can start doing that with the next live show.
Like the porn counter.
Like that is so South Park!
Really? !
Can I do the first question now?
Here we go.
Alright, here's the first question for our folks in the chatroom.
The first question is... Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars, but he was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him a blank.
Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars that he was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him a blank.
I'm just waiting on those answers from the chatroom.
Everyone called him a blank.
The obvious answers are okay.
You guys can put the obvious answers into one.
I think they're locked in.
They're locked in right now.
I'm just going to check and see if they're locked in.
Okay, I've got one.
Okay, I've got both answers.
I do have both answers locked in from the contestant.
I just need to make sure.
Stars, celebrities, are we ready?
You guys are ready?
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
Going around the room.
Let's see.
Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars, but everyone was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him A. Let's go to the contestants.
Vidpower says, Old School Freak.
Everyone called him an Old School Freak.
That's too G-rated, I don't know, we'll see.
SoCalKick says, Everyone called him an Idiot.
Idiot.
Alright, that's a little harsher.
That's more on our page.
Let's see if they get any matches.
We have Idiot and OldSchoolFree.
Let's see, here we go.
Jamie, everyone called him a... Dildo!
Dildo!
Ah, eh, sorry, that is not a match.
Loki, everyone called him a... Cocksmoker.
Cocksmoker!
I'm sorry, that is not a match.
Black Lab, I said... Asshat!
Asshat!
Everyone called him an Asshat.
No, I'm sorry, Asshat is not a match.
Amanda!
I was, like, really drawn for a blank, so all I said was Gorge.
Dork is a good answer, but not a match.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, contestants.
Not a match.
Yana said everyone called him a... Fag.
A fag.
Everyone called him a fag.
Beautiful.
And I said that when he picked love to me that everyone called him a fag.
I also put fag.
We have an in-house match.
We have an in-house match.
So, um, but unfortunately I didn't match what the contestants put, but that would have been the answer.
That would have put you in the lead if you guessed Fag, but unfortunately you did not.
So that is a, that is not a match, I apologize.
Didn't that come up as an answer on the last show?
Yes, it did.
I think it did.
So putting Fag is usually a pretty good way to get points.
Alright, let's do the next question, shall we?
Alright.
Sammy the Sim File Builder was really excited to be participating in Tournamix 3.
But he was shocked to find that the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
He instead decided to go and download some blank.
Sammy the Sim File Builder
was really excited to be participating in Tourney Mix 3, but he was shocked to find that the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
He instead decided to go and download some blank.
Sammy the Sim File Builder, really excited to be participating in Tournament 3.
But he was shocked to find out the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
He instead decided to go download some blank.
Are all our celebrities locked in?
All right, all our celebrities are locked in.
Let's look at the, let me see if the contestants are locked in.
Okay, great.
We do have our contestants in.
So are all the celebrities in?
All our stars?
Yes, okay, everybody's in.
Okay, here we go.
The contestant said he instead decided to go and download some.
SoCalKick says, hidden camera DDR pad porn.
Upskirt Cam.
Upskirt Cam, like what?
Alright, good answer.
Vidpower says, Hardcore XXX Lesbian Emmy Prawn.
Ah, so we have porn and prawn.
Alright, beautiful.
I'm sorry, did you repeat that one?
That sounds like a Chinese buffet, I'm sorry.
If it was a seafood buffet, I bet you wouldn't have a problem with it.
Oh, no, I wouldn't.
All right, here we go.
Let's check with the stars.
Jamie, he decided to go and download some blank.
Yaoi Hentai Pokemon fan art.
Yaoi Hentai Pokemon fan art.
That was almost what I put, but I changed my answer, I have to say.
I almost put that.
Loki, your answer, please.
Well, it's a gimme, come on.
Porn, it's like, do you need an excuse?
He went to go down with some porn.
Alright, is that a match?
What do you think, Loki?
No, it's not because they're freaking stupid and specific, so I don't get it.
Alright, judges say I'm sorry.
Half a point each for each of them?
Alright, half a point each.
Half a point off.
One flaccid point each.
Alright, half a point.
So you get a full point to distribute amongst you guys.
So you each have half a point.
DSCS says, now he's disputing because he said he said porn.
You said hidden camera DDR pad porn.
Loki, did you say hidden camera DDR pad porn?
No.
Hidden camera porn shit?
That's not porn.
You get half a point.
Deal with it.
I think as far as Loki's concerned, if it fucks, it works.
Alright, Black Lab, your answer, please.
I just went with something that I knew they wouldn't say, so I just said Robs.
You said what?
I said Robs.
Oh, Robs!
I thought you said Robs.
I'm like, what?
I have a website?
Sky.com?
I didn't know I had a website.
Oh, I'm sorry.
My bad.
I'm bringing out the Mr. Spanky voice.
My bad.
All right.
It's all tied up.
Half a point each.
Amanda, what did you put?
I originally put porn.
I started saying, no, that's too general.
I need to be a little bit more specific.
So I said barnyard porn.
Barnyard porn!
Word.
Wonderful answer.
Unfortunately, not a match.
Yana, what did he go download?
He downloaded some... Midget porno.
Midget porno.
I'm sorry.
That is also not a match.
Although, I don't know.
Because, you know, a lot of Asian people are pretty short.
And if you're doing the upskirt camp... I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
I'm going to get smacked.
Alright.
Alright.
My answer, as I said, I was trying to match Jamie, but unfortunately I didn't.
He decided to go download some Harry Potter Yaoi.
Okay.
I don't mind Yaoi fandom, but there are some things that I will not stand for.
And this is something about ten-year-old boys.
No, I knew you weren't really going to put that, but I was hoping our contestants would.
Dude, you should have said, download naked pictures of Alan Rickman.
I mean, come on.
That would have been, like, a definite match.
But I thought that, like, most yaoi's, like, they look like they're ten years old as it is, the way they're drawn.
There are no naked pictures of Alan Rickman on the ground.
I'm getting smacked by the chatroom for the short comment, by the way.
All these people that are Asian are hitting me.
I'm getting stabbed in the kneecaps.
I'll stab him with the ferret.
Alright.
Alright, I'm just kidding you guys, Jesus.
Alright, here we go.
Next question, so it's tied up at half a point each, one flaccid point between them, our two contestants, SoCalCakes and VidPower.
Here's the next question.
I think this is the next to last.
No, there is five questions, I apologize, there's five, so this is the third question.
Dana the DDRer was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a blank.
Dana the DDRer was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a blank.
Okay, I have mine.
I don't know, Jamie, what do you think?
I think it's funny.
Go for it.
Okay, go for it.
Shit!
This is going to get really wrong.
Alright, here we go.
Do we have both our contestants locked in?
Are we already in the house?
Oh, Black Lab's still working.
Well, let's see if the contestants are locked in.
Let's see.
Okay, we have... Oh, okay, this is going to be interesting.
This is going to be very interesting.
How many people are we going to offend in this segment?
How many people are we about to offend right now?
Okay, everybody locked in?
Black Lab's still working.
He's slow.
That's all right.
He's the Brett Summers of the show.
She was always the last one to walk in.
If you ever watch 70s Magic Game, which, by the way, the reason to have the Game Show Network is for 70s Magic Game.
Oh, you're in?
No.
All right.
No, the reason to have the Game Show Network is press your luck.
Hello.
Word.
Word.
The new one sucks.
All right.
Here we go.
The question is, Dana the DDR was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a, VidPower says, fag.
DSCS SoCalKick says, wow, everyone here looks like a fag.
They both put the same thing.
They both put fag.
Let's see if they're going to get any matches on this.
Jamie walked through the door and said, wow, everyone here looks like a poo-flinging monkey because they're playing Parapara.
A poo-flinging monkey.
No, I'm sorry.
That is not the answer.
Loki, she walked through the door to the tournament, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a... I have to apologize ahead of time for the comment that I'm going to make to fill in the blank.
I do not mean to offend anybody, but the way it came out, the first thing that came to my head, okay, and I'm not racist or anything.
All right, all right.
Wow, everyone here looks like a sweaty... Yes, sweaty Jack, that's what I said.
Sorry.
Oh my.
Not a match, unfortunately.
Not a match.
I tried to be orange like Orange Lamb.
Oh boy.
Let's see, now you can smack Loki.
You can address those cards and letters.
All right.
Black Lab.
Looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a sweaty pig.
I mean, honestly, that's the best I could come up with because I had something else in mind, but I didn't want to say it.
A sweaty pig.
All right.
So a little more G-rated and friendly to all our friends.
Amanda.
Amanda.
Dana the DDR-ter was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, Wow, everyone here looks like a... Once again, I have to apologize for this.
I've been out of the scene for a while, but I had to take a break a while ago.
A split wannabe.
Wow, everyone here... Which, you know, I say give them half a point each for that comment.
That was good.
Amanda gets a zing.
That's one zing.
Yes, a zing.
And actually, the other thing I was thinking he was going to say, that everyone was a tool, because he says that so much.
He got a lot of laughter in the chat room.
What can you say?
All right.
They deserve half a point each for their answers.
So we're going to up them to one.
Okay, one full point apiece.
They've got one full point apiece.
Beautiful.
Zinget.
Yana.
Wow, everyone here looks like a...
A hairy penis with crabs?
That was lovely.
I tried.
Yana, by the way, not very into the Kamani scene.
You've never been to a DDR tournament at all, huh?
No, I haven't.
We forgive you then.
It's like a penis with, like, a fro or something, you know?
Alright, my answer.
Here's my answer.
I have a furball in my mouth.
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a fag.
I did put fag.
So they get two points each.
The two of three out of Rob's answers are very gay.
Well, you know.
All right, here we go.
Two more questions left here on Orange Lounge Match Game.
I lied.
There's actually two more here.
So they each have two points.
Not bad.
Better than last time.
They've matched half a time each.
I can't believe we came to that half point.
I know we're going to get hate mail on that one.
And Amanda got a zing.
All right.
Your next question.
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal this next weekend.
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
I have mine already.
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
One of our contestants has absolutely no idea how to answer this question.
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal next week and they decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
Doesn't have to be a specific place.
All right.
We have both our contestants locked in.
Are all of our studio celebrities locked in?
One of our studio celebrities ran away from this show.
That's kind of scary.
What?
This will be back in a sec.
Okay.
How about you guys?
Are you guys locked in?
Ready?
Oh, you're debating on an answer.
Oh, he's back in.
Oh, he's got the Raymar stick.
Dude, I want to go back and get a couple of those.
Dude, you've got a rebar stick.
That's cool.
That's pretty.
Wait, wait, turn off the light, Yana.
Turn off the light.
Turn off the light.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, dude, yeah.
Dude, I want one too.
Yeah, I want one too.
That's pretty rad.
Amazing seizure.
Amazing seizure action.
Okay, let's turn the light back on.
Are all our celebrities locked in?
Yes, here we go.
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.
Their first stop definitely had to be... SoCalKicks says, SoCalKicks' place.
Yes, surprise, shock of socks.
By the way, no.
VidPower says, a strip club.
Good answer, good answer, knowing the people in the studio.
All right, Jamie.
Loki and Sky took a trip to Southern California.
They decided their first stop had to be... Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Beautiful answer.
Beautiful, but unfortunately not a match.
I'm so pissed.
I never got to go there.
Loki and I need directions to that place.
I'll find them for you.
I know where the one in Long Beach is.
I have never been there.
This is to be like the best food ever.
You know what they serve?
Chicken and Waffles.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
I love this show.
All right.
Okay, um, next, next is, uh, Loki, yes, Loki and Sky decided to go to Southern California, their first stop had to be... Bathroom, fuck, it's an eight hour drive!
The bathroom, beautiful, but not a match.
Black Lab, okay, their first stop had to be...
I kind of favored one side here.
It said Soap Cow kicked his house, but for reasons other than interview.
Oh, wow.
Dang, that is a match.
That is a match.
Does he have strippers there?
If we get him drunk enough, maybe.
Woohoo!
Wait, no.
No.
Is he going to invite over female strippers?
Not, is he going to strip?
No.
No.
That's what I meant.
He says, Loki, we do.
Alright.
So that's a match.
Three to two.
Oh, VidPower's upset.
But there's still a chance to match, VidPower.
Don't be too upset.
Don't worry.
Amanda.
The first stop had to be... IHGP, International House of Gay Porn.
Amanda says... Did you hear that, Loki?
Amanda says our first stop's gonna be the International House of Gay Porn.
IHGP.
I don't know if you've ever seen this in West Hollywood, there's a gay superstore, and it says GAY SUPERSTORE in big print, and under that, parking in rear.
Where every gay man's dream is.
Alright.
Yana, Sky and Loki went to SoCal Kicks, their first stop had to be... The Dildo Factory.
The Dildo Factory!
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, what?
None of them hear what?
We said Wentz to SoCal, you said SoCal Kicks.
My bad.
Whatever, I'm cracked today.
Okay, so yeah, I'm sorry, that's not a match.
The Dildo Factory Wall of Brilliant Answer is not a match.
I'm sorry.
My answer was, I was thinking along very similar lines as somebody else here in the studio, that our first stop definitely had to be, I put a gas station, because yes, we're going to have to pay.
This is an eight-hour drive.
Unfortunately, not a match.
So, SoCal Kicks is ahead by a score of three to two.
So, VidPower is going to need this next one.
This is it.
This is the last question, so you need to match on this, okay?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go, here we go.
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
We're talking this Jamie right here in the house.
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
Yeah, screw them.
She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
Jimmy, you want to tell that story about The Light FM?
Okay, at my work, my boss, and I like the people I work with, but they listen to The Light FM all day.
Like, they play Celine Dion all day, and Richard Marx, and, and, um...
and Brian Adams.
And they don't play the good Brian Adams songs.
They played Heaven once, that was cool, but they don't play any of the other good songs.
Which he only has one other good song.
What about the one from Robin Hood?
They play that all day.
Alright.
That place sucks.
I have CDs to retaliate with.
And then there's the people outside our office that play loud rap.
I love this quote here.
I'm reading Happy Noodle Boy and it says, I'm going to fly into your butt and prepare all asses for vicious intrusion.
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
I've got a sound clip of Loki.
I handed him my Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
I can just see it now, they're replacing, since the, for the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me, it's kind of lost.
By the way, speaking of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, we're still taking, I think, auditions for the Zombie Day, I think.
I don't know if the shows in the chat room are closed now.
But send in your sound clip auditions to me.
Alright.
Cool!
And they can reach you through the show email address if they need to.
OrangeLaunchRadio at Yahoo.com Alright, here we go.
Jamie was really irritated by her coworkers one day.
She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
VidPower dedicates his answer to EOSVB and says, I'm going to say propel.
Put some propel in her radio.
That would probably blow up the radio.
That would tear up my radio.
SoCalKick says, going to put some yaoi moaning CDs in her radio.
No!
No, we're not putting in the gravitation soundtrack.
Alright, Jamie.
Best way to get some revenge on the co-workers.
You're going to put some... Korean booty music.
Korean booty music in the radio.
Which I have done before.
I'm sorry, not a match.
Good answer.
That's because I've done it.
Oh yeah, okay.
Very good answer.
The only answer, really.
All the others are just wannabes.
Okay, Loki, she decided to put some blank in her radio.
Okay, I was going to say Yurby Coca, but that doesn't make any sense, so Bagpipe Music.
Bagpipe Music!
I've done that before, too.
Brilliant, but not a match.
Black Lab.
She's going to put some... I said the bad TAC music.
The bad TAC music.
I... There's... Exactly.
I have played TAC, by the way, my Ultimate TAC CD in the office before.
So, so far, there's been internal matches.
Pretty good.
There's going to be the 12-minute version of Stoic.
I'd rather listen to Albuquerque than listen to a 12-bit stoic.
Alright.
Okay, Amanda, what is she going to put in her radio?
I misunderstood the question.
That's okay.
That's okay, Amanda, we forgive you anyway.
What does she put in her radio?
I'm thinking, I'm thinking more of, this is like more of a way of destruction.
Oh, okay.
Than anything.
Well, Jamie's pretty destructive.
So, um, cherry bomb juice and vanilla schnapps and vanilla coke.
You, you own, thank you.
That's very close to propel, but unfortunately not close enough.
It's my second happy crack.
I'm, I'm just thinking, you know, put it in the radio, and that way it kind of shortens the circuit and the thing blows up, and you, yeah, you know, spill.
Although today we were at the Folsom Outlets and we saw the CD by Hampton the Hamster.
Fucking shit, burn it.
Not only the Hampton dance song, but various other ones of them singing.
It was quite frightening.
It was pretty frightening.
The songs actually were like, there was this one about them talking and it was this weird country type song and it was just strange.
There was like Dolly Parton on there too.
It was like...
Oh crap.
Alright, Yana.
Nope.
You need to stop quoting that in the middle of nowhere like that.
Anyways, the hamster dance speed version.
They used to have that on their site where you could actually speed up the music and it played twice as fast.
And it was, like, god-awful.
You want to set the website on fire?
Yeah.
Alright, Yana.
That's possible.
Yana, she wanted to piss off her co-workers by putting some Satan music on.
In the radio.
Satan-worshipping music.
Or just Satan music.
Just Satan-worshipping music.
Have you ever done that?
I have put in pagan music in there.
I was listening to one of the older Lorraine A. McAfee CDs.
Beautiful.
Alright, so, my answer was, she got so pissed off at her co-workers, she decided to put some Politary in her radio.
Actually, actually, there has been Politary coming out of my radio before.
Yes, yes.
Because it was on my Fifth Style soundtrack, and I listened to my Fifth Style soundtrack.
So, unfortunately, not a match, which means, by a score of 3-2, SoCalKicks is the winner.
The winner is you.
He loses less.
Congratulations.
Yay, you.
Vidpower, good effort.
Congrats, you.
You know what, two points, I believe, is better than anyone did last week.
That's true.
So, that's something to be proud of.
Now, uh, no, 23 Magus, I believe, got a point at the end, and I was a big liar, and I said his prize would be he'd get his name in lights on the website, and that never happened, because I'm lazy.
So, um, we'll think of, we'll probably do them both.
We'll send him a cookie.
Maybe we'll send him a special Orange Lounge present.
And since we're going to SoCal next week, and we could very well be bumping into SoCalKicks, we'll give SoCalKicks a nice little Orange Lounge present, too.
So, uh... We'll give him an orange.
Yes.
I'm sorry, BlackLock?
I think he wants something else.
23rd Magus is very sad that I never put his name in life on the website.
We'll do that too.
We'll give him a cookie, so shut up.
Cookies are better.
Bloody fuck monkeys, refuse my request of love.
Here's this blood feud ends, grandpappy.
Grandpappy, rub my feet.
Me feet, grandpappy.
On that note, I believe it is a very good time to go to a break.
Yes, we have the wit and lore of Happy Noodle Boy.
That's one of our longest statements ever.
Shit.
We'll be right back after some... More train wreck.
More train wreck.
Speaking of trains, we'll play this one to start off this break.
Enjoy.
We'll be right back in a little bit.
And now DJ let's start rocking it, rocking it, rocking it
I forget that that's the bad mp3 and I can't play that one so we're going to go to the next song right away here.
We're going to play some stuff from Poppin' Music Mickey.
This shit rules.
Enjoy.
What, what, Loki?
And there's also a song off of Nintendo 64 version of Disney's Raid.
All the birds sing words and the flowers bloom in the tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki room Welcome to our tropical hideaway, you lucky people, you If we weren't in the show starting right away, we'd be in the audience too
Flowers Grooming The Diggy, Diggy, Diggy, Diggy, Diggy Room
The bird of paradise is an elegant bird.
It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard.
Most little birdies will fly away, but the Tiki Room birds are here every day.
In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room, in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room, all the birds sing words and the flowers groom in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room.
Now sing it for me Baby, I, I, make it Get down Every time I, I, make it Now get back up
We can march with a mission, a fine musician.
Fun and dancing are the first requisition.
Music in the key, a piece in harmony.
The world all together, and that's the way it has to be.
Moving to the beat, there were shoes on the street.
When they saw the black-and-white, they took off their suits.
In the house, who was it about?
We know in the Mickey, and you see what it's about.
Hey, hey, Mickey.
You busted and lost.
Yeah!
The Disney Pops is coming at ya!
Head em off to the park, homies!
Uh, I mean, homies?
Yeah!
Now anyone can tell you when you're looking for fun, he's the monster with the monsters, he's the only one!
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
You're so bad.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome to our nightmare.
Now, you said you had an impersonation you wanted to do for us.
Yes, Yana?
It's Mickey Mouse having sex.
Oh, oh, oh, Minnie, oh, oh, oh, Pluto, what you doing down there?
Oh, oh, don't stop now.
Oh, oh, keep going Pluto.
Act like it's a hot dog.
Oh, yeah.
Lick that mustard right off, baby.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hi Minnie.
I'm not cheating on you!
Orange Lounge Radio, how low can you go?
How low?
So low.
That was cool.
If it wasn't air, why?
I'm dismayed.
We need to do our Fuck Use of the Week.
We're going to do our Fuck Use of the Week?
Yeah.
Okay, well then let me close up all the windows so I can get folks to send me their F-Use of the Week.
You want to send those on over to me over private message or you can send them to our email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
But before the Fuck Use of the Week, maybe we ought to, because I need a little time to get the music queued up, maybe now's a good time to do the Sim Update?
Sim Update.
Sim Update.
Okay.
Um, let's see.
Big news this week, of course, is that Tourney Mix 3, it's, uh, all the files are up to download.
Oh, wait, you can't because the server's clogged.
Sorry.
Uh-huh.
So, no, they're all up to download, but you're one of the lucky ones that's able to actually get through and you can download over 100 different DWIs.
Uh, did you make the cut?
No, I got bumped down.
Don't!
Eh, doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter at all because no one can play any of the files right now, so ha!
Bitter, table for one, bitter.
And, big news on my site, leechfromloki.com, or .tk is going to become one of the largest sim file sites ever.
Ever!
Ever!
I got, um, DDR Llama from DDR Maniacs has given me unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth to do with whatever I want.
So now, you will be able to find leechfromloki.tk at the new address, which is not yet up, but it will be, um,
www.willddrforfood.net And I will have everything.
Right now in my collection I have 1800 sim files, so all those will be going up.
And then of course the Tourney Mix stuff and whatever else I can throw up there.
Everything.
Everything, yes.
Everything that's going to be fixed.
I have to fix everything to make sure it's all working correctly.
But, yeah, so I have to do a complete redesign of the site, and that might take a while, so, you know.
In the meantime, well, there is a few updates on my site, but I haven't really linked those to the main page yet, so you won't see them unless I've told you, so.
Oh, well.
Other than just the sim file stuff...
Not too much going on other than Turning Mix 3.
I mean, that's pretty much the big thing.
Of course, I already mentioned earlier in the show, but if anyone just joined us, MakeEditGetPorn is getting pushed back to two weeks from now because of our site going down, so...
23rd Magus would like to know if we can do a live step file review at some point.
That's a good idea.
I can't set it up tonight because I don't have the resources because what happens is if I load the emulator on this computer, the show crashes.
Or we get a lot of drops.
We get a lot, a lot of drops.
So I can't do it.
But what we can do is one night we'll get my roommate to log into his system and we can do a step file review on his computer.
Maybe we'll review.
We'll do our own take on some of the Tourney Mix 3 entries.
What do you think?
Alright, I've already, oh, and here's a funny thing.
Some people are getting pissed off that they can't download their own files, so they're putting their files up on DDR Maniacs to download for other people.
Well, unfortunately, stupid people out there, that disqualifies you.
Ha ha.
So, you get to try the nice sim files out there, but they're going to be disqualified for a while.
Mr. Spanky needs a partner!
How to be bondable with leather straps
Yeah, it's for a PC version of DDR that Konami, like, Hawaii put out that popped.
They say that it has downloadable characters, though.
Nobody plays it.
Oh, I thought, they've rearranged the page a little bit, it looks like.
I thought they did.
No, I guess not.
I thought there were only one more set downloadable.
Anyway, there's Mr. Spanky right there, Amanda.
Oh my.
Yeah.
It's that bad.
Alright, it's even worse in audio.
Yes, it's even worse than audio.
Mr. Spanky is a regular on our show, though.
He does.
What do you think of Zack?
He gives our love advice.
I'm a lesbian.
Oh.
Well, what do you think of Alex?
I like my girlfriend.
Alright, whatever.
Can't even get you to cyber flirt.
Anyway.
Hey, I fucking miss my Alice on my DDR characters, okay?
I can name my car after her, shit.
That someone set on fire, correct?
Backseat, yes.
Someone set Amanda's... Someone set Alice on fire, isn't that sad?
Yes, um, so when are we getting on to the fuck you?
Amanda's... Wow, I think Amanda's really eager for this.
What do you think, Jamie?
Let's go to the fuck you's.
Let's go to the fuck you's indeed.
Here we go.
Okay, my first fuck you of the week actually goes to my belt.
Which, um, it's one of those neat ones that you get at, I got it at Torrid.
And, uh, it has, uh, these, uh, leather, uh, long leather laces that hang down the side, and one of them broke off.
So, there's, you know, the $18 one.
Um, my other one goes toward, again, Roseville Gotham, but everyone heard their rant earlier.
And, actually, even more so, it goes toward that manager, Chris, and Steve, who runs the place.
Let's see what else we have.
Eat our collective pussy.
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry.
I actually, if I'm going to have something get near my pussy, it won't be done.
Zing!
Okay.
I only use, I only prefer high quality equipment.
Thank you.
Not broken like they are.
Okay.
Anyway.
Next, um, what did I say my other one was?
I kind of got left out.
Um,
I don't remember.
Oh, that's kind of shitty.
What about your tooth thing?
Yeah, my tooth.
This is sort of half bad, half good.
After eating a delicious dinner of, you know, chicken over rice on Wednesday from this really good teriyaki place, it's near my work.
I'm walking over to Target from the store and my mouth starts to hurt.
And I feel back to my back left molar and there's a big break in it.
Yay, I'm happy.
So I'm hurting all day and the broken parts are rubbing up against the skin of my mouth.
They're really hurting.
So I had an emergency visit with my dentist next day.
My dentist is awesome.
It turned out that the tooth that was broken was one of my wisdom teeth and not one of my molars, which was a good thing, because the wisdom teeth needed to go anyway.
They were slightly impacted and causing stress on my other teeth.
So, I went in, had the tooth out.
This is what sucks is that I didn't have a way to get there, and I had to walk in the rain to the bus stop.
Wait, 30 minutes in the rain.
While your mouth was bleeding.
No, that was what the...
and then I get down there and then it's still raining when I have to come back and walk home in the rain from the other bus stop and the whole time is I have my mouth is bleeding from where the you know I've got my mouth full of gauze I get home and I'm tired and then this is what amazes me is how many people were telling me oh you should take it easy I felt fine it's just a tooth
I'm telling you, though, you didn't go under and you only had one done.
But when I went under and had all four done, I was out for 24 hours.
You did not talk to me.
I did not exist to you.
But after that, I was fine.
So I can see that part.
I'm going to have them leave me late for my other brief.
All they're going to do is just rub my mouth up.
Well, when I had mine removed, I had all four out of one.
They put me under both the IV and the gas anesthetic.
I'm not having an IV.
Well, they knocked me out cold for an hour to get all four of my teeth out.
And I was so wasted afterwards from all the painkillers.
I was pretty much dead for my entire spring break that year.
Well, I was pretty tired.
I went to work the next day, and I was really exhausted.
They didn't expect much of anything from me.
When I got mine out at 15, actually, I was fine.
They put me out.
They gave me the gas and the IV.
Pretty much got home.
I had to sit in the car.
My dad was waiting for me to get back to work, so I was putting cups on my cheeks because they were cold.
Pretty much got home, and I was talking to my friends, I was feeling fine, and the next day I was swelled up about twice the way I should be.
So if any of those that you're listening to need your wisdom teeth out, and they tell you don't talk afterwards, don't talk.
Because they forgot to tell me, and I did.
So this is what sucks about all the work I need done.
I need my other three wisdom teeth out, and then I have a broken molar next to my right wisdom tooth, because those need an action from those teeth.
And, um...
Thanks for watching!
Nor can I spit, so.
Useless!
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
We love you.
Even if she can't spit or swallow.
Or suck.
Spit or suck.
I'm sorry.
You can swallow, though.
I can swallow just fine.
I just wanted to add, though, on the IV thing, because you said that you won't do the IV.
You know, I didn't know they were going to do an IV on me.
So really, really late, fuck you, to the people that did my surgery.
What they did, they distracted me.
They had a nurse on the left talking to me.
and I'm like, yeah, da-da-da-da-da, and then like, okay, we're just gonna, you know, put some alcohol on your hand, da-da-da-da-da, and then all of a sudden, I feel this little prick on my right side, I look, they fucking stuck the IV in me, and I feel it crawl up my arm, hit my brain, I'm out.
I'm out cold.
That was sneaky and mean.
I cannot have an IV because I will bruise very badly.
When they did my IV, they told me I had like a week at a time that I was going to get it.
But, I mean, those things knock you back quick.
They put the gas on me, and then it took like about a minute, and my fingers started getting tingly, and they're like, countdown from 100.
And I was like, I'm not even going to try.
And I was like, out as I finished that set, it was quick.
I'm going to ask them actually if I can stay awake for a minute.
I would rather be... Well, they're going to numb my mouth anyway, right?
Yeah, it's still... Yeah, when you're unconscious, it's a lot easier.
You know what?
I fell asleep when I was having five fillings done.
But Jamie's a trooper.
It was not... Well, I know, but he hit a nerve on one of them.
Because the nerve went numb.
It was one of the major nerves in my mouth.
And I said, you know, that's what it is.
I got to jump in here.
I know you probably got some more fuck yous in here.
Oh, that's it?
Okay, because I want to get to Amanda and Yana because they got to go soon.
So I wanted to go ahead and let them jump in with their FUs of the week because they've never got to do this before.
So Amanda, I know this isn't really a fuck you song, but I know it's Amanda's favorite of yours.
Not anymore?
Not really.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, then it is a fuck you song.
Then it is a fuck you song because you don't like it anymore.
I'm sorry.
No, I still like it.
It's not as good.
Oh, okay.
Okay, I have a few here.
Some of these are belated, but that's okay.
On Yana's part, fuck you to the doctors who told her her spleen was swallowed up and made her go to the hospital emergency room.
She had to get surgery to get it operated on when there was nothing wrong except she had a sinus infection and strep throat and she was dehydrated.
No comment, I don't like hot dogs.
Oh, the chicken bake?
Yeah, those chicken bakes are hella good.
Yeah, um, I know I have, I'm sure, several other fuck yous, um, I'm trying to think.
Fuck you to, um, oh yeah, fuck you to Sonoma County police officers for pulling me over that day and giving me a speeding ticket.
Don't!
How fast?
How fast?
Um, I was actually going 80...
But he clocked me for 80 and a 65, he clocked me for 75 because he actually asked me how fast I was going.
How fast I thought I was going, I think, well, you know, I noticed as I looked down, I saw it was about 75, you know, about between 70 and 75.
And believe it, yeah, well, actually I was going 80, but he clocked me at.
Fortunately, though, the police officer was very nice.
It wasn't actually him himself, it was more just the law.
Fuck the law.
Thank you.
Bucky to very other people who shall rename nameless, but I don't know if you listen in any way.
What did they do to you?
Oh, just the general public?
Fuck the general public who doesn't listen to Orange Lounge?
Well, let's see.
Well...
Hang on, I shall return, hang on.
To be continued.
To be continued.
Well, actually, no, just fuck you to, um, Yana's roommate, Jamie, because... No, not you, not you, not you.
This is, um, Miss P. Oh, Princess.
Yes.
What did she do now?
What hasn't she done?
Who hasn't she done?
Alright.
No, well, like, no, he's just... He's just a terrifying, terrifying person.
I've met Princess P a couple times.
Interesting, interesting character.
Yes.
All right.
Is that all your fuck yous?
Oh, oh, oh, no, there's one more.
Jamie kind of waving the little Rayvar wand, reminding me.
Fuck you to Carl Hills, who was once part of Cool World, who at one of our recent LiveScapes events ran off with our door money and at a second event actually got in broken, sorry, changed our voicemail around and locked us out of our own voicemail.
and later said on there, oh, well, I don't even know where this party is, blah, blah, blah.
And basically made it so that no one showed up at the party and he might send our company under.
So, fuck you to Cool World and Carl Hills.
And Cool World, just because they suck.
Carl Hills, he said, he just sucks fat dick.
That's all it is.
He's got nothing better to do than steal a lot of people's money and have nothing.
He just sucks.
That's fucking it.
He sucks.
Boycott Planet New Year.
Thank you.
I was going to ask Yana if she had any angsty FUs.
Yeah, I just want to say, fuck you, Jamie.
Not this Jamie, not this Jamie.
No.
This one.
Turkey.
We call it Turkey.
Turkey.
Nothing comes out of his mouth.
When he talks, you hear nothing but Turkey, Turkey, Turkey.
Turkey, Turkey, yeah.
You know, that's about it.
I mean, it's like watching Charlie Brown, you know, from his mouth it's just a little thing about Taki, Taki, Taki, sausage, Taki, Taki, Taki, tampon, Taki.
Okay, and you know, I just don't understand this fat fuck, okay?
He's so fucking annoying.
Okay, he's like really hairy.
I don't know.
He looks like a drag queen that just has too much hair on him.
You know, it looks really sad because he has too many hormones.
I'm trying to figure out what's scary.
When he comes onto a sheet or his towel.
I think both.
He's scarier than the other.
No, what it is is... I think it's the purple towel.
No, what it is is his towel doesn't even fit on him.
Yes.
It's so scary.
It's like, dude, don't come out.
I was going to say, at least the sheet covers more.
Okay, and when he takes a bath, it's just beyond filth, okay?
It's just really nasty.
You're listening to Orange Lesbian Radio.
I don't think none of them do.
20 of them do.
That would really suck if they did, though.
But anyways, yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to Jack Janney and...
It's lucky to Pepsi, too!
I hate Pepsi!
Anything else here?
Uh, I covered the Doctor Who Disney Rumble explain thing already for you.
Oh, yeah!
And never, ever trust, like, the, the, what is it?
I'm just there to get some, like, some kind of medicine to get rid of my cold, right?
And the guy's just like, take a look at my stomach, he's like, your spleen's blown up.
He gets another second opinion, he's like, your spleen's blown up.
Oh yeah, and, um, fuck you to the doctors who actually decided to do a pregnancy test on Yana after she...
Yes, I am pregnant by my woman's tongue.
After she told them that she was a virgin and a lesbian, so yeah, we're doing March.
Immaculate conception, you never know.
Yana could be carrying the baby Jesus.
We have to check.
No, Rob, Rob.
I am the next virgin Mary.
Rob, Rob, we're doing March.
Yeah, we're...
No, what I'm saying is, it really sucks before people just like, they don't have no money whatsoever, right?
They go to these clinics just to get this freaking stupid checkup, and they send them to UC Davis where they have no fucking money, okay?
I'm stuck with a $6,000 fucking phone bill.
It's not a phone bill, but if people wonder why I don't go to the doctor anymore unless I'm dying...
Yo, well they told me my spleen was swelled up, so what am I supposed to do to fit there?
We gotta make sure that Jamie's not carrying the baby Jesus FD either, so we gotta give her a pregnancy test.
There ain't nothing immaculate about me.
Beautiful.
Ding.
Well, if you have that comment, then I don't know why you wanted to count on Yana.
What's that?
Oh, being immaculate?
I am a virgin, okay?
And it was really hard for him to just do a pelvic exam.
And I mean, it was scary because it sounded like every typical straight guy out there trying to get sex with a woman.
It's going to be easy, it's going to, I'm not going to hurt you, it's just, I'm just going to do this, do that, and you know what?
It's going to be quick and simple.
God, you know what?
I asked her, what's that?
Maybe you're rich, but you're far from immaculate.
Well, you know... I'm just gonna take this cold, hard little tool here... And I'm gonna sneak it right up inside you!
Okay, I'm sorry, but guys make the worst gynecologists.
Okay, let me tell you something, let me tell you something.
When the guy was actually doing, almost going to do the pelvic exam, right?
He was like asking me, he was like, well, I don't know how to be like dirty jokes or anything, you know, just like, you know, make you look really calm.
But the girl next to me, she's like, yeah, I got a joke for you.
It's like really child pornography stuff.
I'm like looking at her like, you dumb fuck, what the hell are you doing here?
But then I asked the guy, I was like, you know, I asked him, I said, yeah, I got one joke for you.
What does a gynecologist and a pizza delivery guy have in common?
They both can smell it, but they can't eat it.
That joke went in.
Oh, that joke just won the show.
I'm speechless.
You guys got any little rants left in you?
No, not really.
It's just, fuck you, County.
Fuck you, Jamie.
Not you, Jamie.
Thank you.
You know, you're the kind one.
Miss P, take it.
Daddy, take it, take it, take it.
I mean, obviously this guy's got more internet access into his mouth than ever.
Well, he's got a mustache to hide all the stretch marks, okay?
If you see any gay guys out there, okay, I am a lesbian.
Let you guys know.
My imagination just broke.
I'm sorry.
But no, just to let you guys know, if you ever guys...
If you guys ever go to the bases or anywhere, any gay club, and see some guy with like a really bad mustache, okay, he's got more stretch marks than fucking any guy in this town, okay?
I'm sorry.
But yeah, anyway.
Maybe even mustaches for added pleasure.
And with that, we do have to take off because I'm really hungry.
I like how the only thing distinctly Bomani-related about this segment is the music playing in the background.
Thank you.
You are so kind.
I could just kiss you, but no, I can't.
Here, lick my chocolate nipple.
Thank you, the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys very much for being here.
We appreciate it.
Yes, this crazy one here.
My name is Joanna.
We'll be back soon.
She'll be back next weekend.
Two drink minimum.
Don't forget to tip your waitress.
She'll have more jokes.
It will be like the next Howard Stern, you know, but a little bit more better, okay?
Amanda, thank you for being with us, and, uh, wow.
Hi.
Or, bye, yes.
It's time for me to go.
You know what?
I have to say this to all the people that are listening to this.
Okay, don't picture it, just have it inside your head, okay?
Monkey fucking football.
Thank you, dear.
Twitch?
There had to be one big monkey.
Good night, ladies.
Thank you for being here.
We love you.
I love you.
I love you more.
I love you more.
I love you.
Okay.
I hope my roommate...
I love you, boo!
I love you, boo!
I don't know how to follow that.
I'm not a lesbian, I can't follow that.
Let's see, you know my regular FDs of the week.
Stupid drivers, stupid people, people that talk to me on the phone, people that talk to me that you don't know in person, stupid people that work behind the counters, Golfland, and Nickel City for not having anything there and making me drive down there to go check it out and there's nothing there.
So that.
Yeah, they make you pay $2 to get in.
I'm thinking, oh, there might be an upstairs and an downstairs.
Nope, what you see is what you got.
But it was... Anyways, so, yeah, F you to that.
F you to the DDR East Coast Invasion for thinking that their servers could actually handle people leeching 100 sim files.
Or are you fucking stupid or something?
That's never gonna work.
Never worked last time.
It's not gonna work this time.
So, yeah, F you to them.
and that's all I've got for right now.
I have to go to the stupid movie gallery, the store, the chain that I deal with because they're all frickin' Southern.
Stupid.
Okay, fine.
They're Midwestern and stupid.
Alright, and, uh, yeah, I don't have too much more to go.
I have to go to the stupid Del Taco for making me feel sick.
Yeah.
That's it.
Alright, moving on to Black Lab.
Do you feel like you just swallowed a machete?
What's your F.U.V.s?
I don't remember what it was.
Oh, yeah, because of the irony, I'm sorry.
I forgot, so I just picked something random.
We'll save that for the chatroom.
Sorry, I forgot irony.
Hold on, I'll find you music.
Working on it, working on it, working on it.
Alright, here we go.
Okay.
Now that it's on, um... Let's see.
Um...
So, constantly, I have very little to rant about this week, because I've actually had a good week.
I got away from school, I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in six months, and we've been spending plenty of time together for the evening.
Not that yet.
Or, yet.
Well, I really don't mean yet.
Anyway, it happened.
Um...
Seconding everything about Golfland, yeah.
I hate the rain, especially when I have to drive in it.
I just...
I think I'm coming off my sugar high now.
That sucks.
That's it?
You usually email me like ten FUs a week and you come to the station, you get to be here, be a part of the show experience, you can only come up with two lousy FUs?
I'm pathetic, I'm sorry.
You make Captain Jack cry.
I'd like to see him cry.
Because then I can mock him for it.
Alright.
That's it?
That's really it?
If you think it's something, let me know.
We'll come back.
Alright.
Alright.
My FU of the week.
I'd like to give a big FU to my mother.
I was at the house today.
I was making a payment because we have an insurance plan under both of our names so that I get a better rate because I have an accident on my record.
They don't.
And I still say FU.
That accident was not my fault.
You were speeding, you son of a bitch.
I don't care if I have to stop sign.
My FU goes to my mom because when I went to make a payment, I get a phone call about two hours later.
Did you go through the Christmas presents while you were here?
Somebody shipped the Christmas presents.
Somebody shipped the Christmas presents.
It's all wrong.
No, I did not go through the Christmas presents.
Are you sure?
You're lying to me.
Why are you laughing?
I'm laughing because you're being a dumbass.
Yeah, F you.
You ask me that every year.
Every damn year you ask me if I shake the Christmas.
I don't care.
Christmas got old.
You know, once I left house, you know, I don't get what I want anymore.
I get clothes.
Alright.
One more thing that I should... I don't know why...
But for some strange reason, there's like, I cannot come up with anything that I want for Christmas anymore.
It's like, why am I not being my usual greedy self?
You know, normally I'd have a list of like 20 things that I would want, which I don't, and well, I don't need.
And yet this year I come up with...
Like, two things.
And they're things that I would need.
It's like, my change of mentality is really upsetting me.
Alright, I got like a little smaller view.
These are complete more or less...
Um, I've ever seen, okay, I bought, I went out and bought Showgirls because my girlfriend wants to see that movie.
Yes.
She could have borrowed it for me.
That's alright, it's only eight bucks.
I really don't, it doesn't matter.
So anyways, so I bought Showgirls, so she just wants to watch it.
I don't know why, but whatever, so she, we watched it.
And I had this urge to go to a strip club.
The thing is, they're so fucking expensive.
Why do they have to be so expensive?
We'll go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night.
Obviously not this Tuesday or next Tuesday.
It's the holidays.
Go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night.
It's unlimited drinks, bottomless, for $14.
And if you sit in the front row, you'll have to pay like a dollar or something for the strippers.
It's good.
It's a good deal.
You take $20, you have fun all night.
I know.
I've done before.
Yeah, I knew.
Look, even I go to strip club and we all know.
It's just so fucking expensive.
I'm talking about lap dances, okay?
Lap dances are fucking expensive.
Two song minimum, that's $40.
I'll get you a lap dance for Christmas.
That's right.
Don't buy a lap dance in Vegas.
Because they can't, they can't.
They're not allowed to actually sit on the laps anymore.
In LA, they have touching.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, dear God.
I know where I'm getting dragged.
Oh, no, I'm not dragging you nowhere, because it was at this one place that Eric's Punk Night on the Zach's Vine boards, his cousin goes there, reaches that place quite a bit.
He knows where it's at.
I don't know, so...
No need for strip clubs.
Okay, back to me again because I'm slow and I'm coming up with things now.
As for the Tuesday night thing...
I hated how good shows always say they leave off at a really suspenseful part, like 24 this week.
Yeah, fuck 24.
It's like, three weeks on 24.
It's like, three weeks.
Three weeks.
Why?
Why do they make us wait?
Okay, I'm going to see suspense like that for Buffy, but that's because they canceled our cable.
What?
And I didn't see the last episode of Buffy.
Yeah, it's not being recorded.
I'm not sure.
I don't think it's there.
I'm sorry.
21st, baby.
Uh-oh.
Okay, first of all, Buffy is the only good writing that happens to be on TV right now.
Unless you count... Where did writing come into Buffy?
Shut up and let me finish.
Unless you count Angel or Firefly, which are all written by the same guy.
Okay?
Firefly's not...
Well, okay.
Either way.
It's like sitting and watching a movie every week.
Good writing makes a good show.
You know, Firefighter looked like a live-action version of Cowboy Bebop.
Along with good acting.
Oh, no, wait.
Not Cowboy Bebop, but Outlaw Star.
I only watched, like, Cardi B's episode of Outlaw Star.
Well, 24 is better.
But Buffy's very good.
24 is unique.
And it has Keef instead of... Keef is still hot to this day.
But I'd still have to go with Buffy.
I'm sorry.
No, but actually...
I find it funny because, uh, I actually, uh, Kiefer Sutherland's, like, better than Buck.
Just, I mean, what's her name?
Sarah Michelle Gellar.
Okay, but, but... Like, here's Buck, or here's Sarah Michelle Gellar, and here's Kiefer Sutherland.
But did Kiefer ever do Rocky?
Uh-huh, no.
But do I care?
That did.
Moving right along, because this debate won't end if I don't end it now.
24!
24!
24!
I am sending subliminal messages.
24!
24!
Don't make me smack your ass.
You will watch 24!
I'm in steel-toed boots right now.
Isn't Buffy on at 8?
No.
They are on at the same time, my bad.
Alright, anyway, watch them tape one, watch the other, Jesus.
Alright, here we go.
Do I have any FUs left?
I don't think I do.
You're right, I don't.
We're so going to end this show.
We have a fight, a fight just broke out.
God, this has been the Jerry Springer episode of Orange Dance Radio.
We've had lesbians.
We've had a fight break out.
I've got the sound samples on that TV.
All right, all right, all right.
Ah, jeez, now Panda's getting thrown.
All right.
Can I do the chat room entries now?
Moving right along.
DSCSS SoCalKick says, over limit and being $145 total bill is my FU.
And I don't know what he meant.
Oh, credit card?
Oh.
Credit card, right?
I have no idea if he means like his bandwidth or credit card or what, I must have missed it.
But he also says, Merry fucking Christmas, I have a broken digital camera and a paid off cell phone bill along with hair bleach cost.
He must have said, oh, he's pissed at me now because I didn't know what it was.
Ah, that's it.
If you're going to yell at me, I'm saving you for last.
All right.
Strayza says he wants to throw out a huge FU to his dad for telling mom that he's only going to put $150 into Christmas, and he found out that Woody's applying that $150.
He's putting that cash into circulation to fix the sink that he broke at least six months ago.
He should be fixing the sink because it needs to be fixed, not do it as a fucking Christmas gift to mom.
Hmm.
Interesting.
That's like lame Christmas.
23rd Magus says, I have a big thaw humbug or a fuck you to the Christmas season.
Christmas sucks when you're broke.
Bork the whole fucking season.
He put bork.
If he meant pork, I don't know.
A very accomplished fuck you to Matsuri Japan.
I beat you, bitch.
Wahaha, cough.
Okay, out.
He wants to also add that the pizza delivery boy and the gynecologist are also hot to your door in three minutes.
Angel says, F you to the Max 2 machine at Rona Park, Scandia, because it stopped taking tokens today.
Bad DDR machine.
Come visit our neck of the woods, you'll have some real angst built up in you, don't worry.
DarkTetsuya says, F you to himself for not waiting for Max USA to save before switching games.
Shouldn't you save that privately?
What?
Anyway, next question.
Okay, I don't... Good.
I must have missed something.
Good.
Let's go to Brack2000.
Says, F you to missing the first half of the show since some people came over to try out DDR.
Even though it was a good night for me and I was passing 7-footers, which is a big improvement for me.
Word.
If anyone wants to know what to get me for Christmas next year, pick up the December 2002 Maxim issue.
It's page 78.
I think you'll be very...
It's at the bottom of the page.
Fuck the bottom of the page, it's at the top of the fucking page.
May I do VidPower's FUs now?
Yeah.
Okay, VidPower says, I'm actually a happy bunny this week, I don't really have any FUs.
No FUs for you!
That's right, I'm the FU Nazi.
Fair enough.
Did you hear that?
VidPower says, no FUs for you.
Oh, how special.
He's the FU Nazi tonight.
I was looking at the email.
No, we do not have anybody email.
I'm checking the last ones that just came in.
Our bestest friend in the whole wide world, Twen, says, F you to getting something that someone else got you for Christmas three days before Christmas.
Okay.
To getting something that someone else got you.
Like a fruitcake?
Giving a present to somebody else who's already given one.
Like herpes.
The givin' keeps on givin'.
Alright, uh, 23rmega says, yes, he said Borg, as in fuck, as in screw, as in ass rape with a 2DX controller, as in hot monkey sex or... I've never heard the word Borg used for that before, that's amazing.
Actually, the word, the word Borg was used... I've heard Borg used for that before, but only one person I know uses that.
That's so 80s, okay.
And he's not...
It's actually people at Real Ultimate Power.net.
Remember, they say that Real Ninja pork sausage.
While they're on their guitars and decapitating their mom.
Because remember, their power is so great, it kicks your mom right in the face.
Remember, 9 out of 10 winners get their heads cut off by Real Ninja.
Twins adding an explanation, so we don't keep calling him Kirby Man or whatever we were saying.
Explanation.
Lives with mom, but dad got him a DVD box set yesterday, the Back to the Future box set, that his grandma on the other side of the family already got him.
So, that's why you asked for a receipt.
You asked for a receipt.
Take it back.
Amen.
Get something you really want.
That is the official Orange Lounge advice of the day.
By the way, good thing Derek is slow.
Word.
You have another one, Loki?
Oh, okay, cool.
Alright, we're going to end the FU's of the Week.
That's it.
Nail in the coffin.
Segment's done.
It is already 8.50.
We're damn near close to the end of the show already, and you know what we've got to do?
You know what we've still got to do?
We've got to do listless, and we've got to do the cage match.
We've got to do them both.
So we're going to... I would think...
Do Cage Match.
I was going to say, let's take the opportunity during Cage Match to get our stuff ready for Listless.
Yes, we'll do them both at the same time.
We're brilliant.
So tonight's Listless.
Jamie, tell us about tonight's Listless.
Best song, Behmany song released in this year, 2002.
SoCalKicks says I forgot one of his.
I thought I got them all.
I closed your window, SoCal.
I'm sorry.
Send it again.
I'll read it.
I thought I got it.
My bad.
All right, so we're going to do the cage match while we prepare our list.
We're going to do best Bomani song leased in 2002.
So it can't be old school, it has to be new school.
We're talking Max 2, 8th and 7th style, I believe.
7th style was early this year.
Guitar Freaks.
So any of those games you can pick for best Bomani song of 2002.
Because next week on the show, Jamie, what's going to happen next week on the show?
We ain't going to be here.
We ain't going to be here.
We're still sort of debating, I guess, what we're going to do.
We might do a best of.
Someone's cable might be working.
Namely me.
We'll surprise everybody.
So there's going to be one of two things happening.
There's going to be a best of show or you're going to get the Jamie experience.
And we're playing all Eurobeat and TAC.
So deal with it.
and I will accept guests.
Alright.
Uh, DSCS SoCalKicks, last FU, Merry fucking Christmas, I have a broken digicam and a paid off cell phone bill along with hair bleach costs.
I know I said that already, oh well.
I guess I didn't say it the right way or something.
Anyway, can't say I haven't said it now.
BlackClap's yelling at you.
Okay, let's move on to the cage match while we prepare our list.
This means we're going to do hardly any breaks tonight, something the chat room always demands.
We take less breaks and do more talking.
Okay, let's get into it.
Okay, so... Yes, last week...
Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a winner for two weeks in a row.
This song was the victor of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
Because I'm fucking cool.
Because you are fucking cool.
The winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match was, Jamie, tell us about, because it was your submission.
This is, by the way, it's not Happy Hardcore, it's just labeled.
Okay, yeah.
But it is the Echo Show remix of the Knight Rider theme song.
I remember being in the third grade and drawing pictures of Kit in the middle of class because I thought the car was cool.
I hated it in and out of the office.
Oh, dang, okay.
I got the real FU from SoCalKicks and it's huge.
I don't know how I missed this.
How did I miss that?
Anyway, okay, wait, we'll go back to the FU for a sec.
FU to the lousiest hell goodbye party Kendra had.
Much love to you and your leaving to Japan, but that party sucked.
FU, Jackie, for still playing games with me and not being sure if things are going to happen or not.
FU, CyberPixels, and not having auto-shell access.
Fuck you, Pearl, for needing shell access and not being able to get PHP image gallery thumbnail or script to work.
Fuck you, Metroid Prime, for its vague artifact clues.
Fuck you, Ruben, for the whole camera deal, even though we got it settled, and now I now have a new Digicam, an FU cell phone service for only being 200 minutes and me going 463 minutes.
All right, we're done.
No more FUs.
Oh, yes.
So here it is.
There's a clip of last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme song, because Jamie says kid is hot.
Dude, the car was fucking amazing.
I still want to get that car.
Alright, here we go.
Here's last week's winner.
All right, Jamie's hoping to make this one three victories in a row, but it's gonna... And if you love me, you'll vote for it.
It's gonna have to win, and chatroom, you guys will have the final vote.
Now, we don't play that whole song, because it did win the last couple weeks, so we kind of give it a little bit of a disadvantage.
But you guys are familiar with it, because you listen to the show every week, don't you?
But you guys can vote for either that, or you can vote for one of the two new songs.
I'm gonna go ahead and do my entry first, then we'll get to Loki's entry.
My pick for this week is going to be a popular artist, Ayumi Hamasaki.
A lot of you seem to dig her.
And I've got a trance remix of the song Connected.
And this is going to be my entry for this week.
And I like this song because the video reminds me of Bjork.
If you've ever seen this video, it's pretty cool and it's very Bjork-ish.
Actually, I don't have it.
Brad does.
Our friend Brad here at Regal on the show, he has it.
But this is going to be it.
So here's our first entry in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
This is Ayumi Hamasaki with a trance remix.
I'm not sure of the remix name, but it's called Connected.
So here, enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura
3D Duplicate
Hello!
Hey, we're back!
Hey, how'd you like that one?
That was Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, the latest entry into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, where the winning song voted by you in the chatroom gets put into regular rotation on Orange Lounge Radio for the next week.
So, last week's winner was Knight Rider, you can vote for that.
This week you have Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, or... Loki, what's the next track?
Um, the next track is going to be from the... Wait, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you because we didn't get feedback on Ayumi Hamasaki.
Sorry, we have to do the feedback part.
Jamie, what'd you think of that one?
I like how you make the best ones a little bit repetitive, so I'd have to say an 8.
An 8.
Black Lab.
A little bit of that, I didn't hear it because I went to the bathroom real quick.
That was okay.
Like Amy said, it was kind of repetitive.
I'd go with a 7.
7.
Loki.
I'm giving it a 6 because I like a Yumi Hamazaki, but it's not Amaboku Beyond.
Alright.
I almost did that one instead.
I'm going to go ahead and give it, I'm actually not going to give it a 10, even though it was my own pick.
I'm only going to give it about an 8 too.
I do like the song, I think it's cool, very Bjorgian.
It is a little repetitive, but I still think it's cool.
And I hope it dethrones Knight Rider.
Just kidding, just kidding.
I hope that the chatroom gets their way, whatever they play.
Now, Loki, I'm sorry, you can do your... Alright, now, this is going to be kind of a train wreck, because I forget which track is on the CD, but what it is, is it's actually the song from the, well, not really a hit movie, but it's a cool movie, Run Lola Run.
This is Believe by Franco Potente.
You also might have seen her in Resident Evil.
She was the main character.
Actor and singer.
Now, this is going to be cool, because I like Run Lola Run.
Let's hear this.
Alright, but now, I have to intro this.
This...
The sample you're going to hear are actually the whole song.
It's got part of another song in the beginning of it, because this is on one of my mix CDs that I actually mixed together.
So it doesn't cut off anything in the song, because the song begins with dialogue in German, so it doesn't really matter.
Okay, we're going to make sure this is the right one, okay?
Here we go, here we go.
Okay, so here it is.
This is Loki's pick.
The name once more time, in case they can vote, they want to vote for it.
Believe.
Believe.
This is Believe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Cape.
Believe.
Believe.
I don't believe in trouble, I don't believe in pain, I don't believe there's nothing left but running here again.
I don't believe in promise, I don't believe in chance, I don't believe you can resist the things that make you sad.
I don't believe in silence, cause silence makes you slow.
I don't believe in silence cause silence hits us both
Thanks for watching!
All right, that was the end of that one, because that was part of a kind of a Megamix CD.
So, there you have it.
Your three entries for this week's Cage Match.
You have Knight Rider, last week's Victor, two weeks in a row.
Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, and that track was Believe.
What did you think of Believe, Jamie?
I think it would have put me to sleep had I not listened to it.
Seven.
Seven for Jamie.
Black Lab.
I kind of like the beginning, but then it kind of starts, I kind of started to lose some places, yeah, for the end.
But, I, I'll, I'll just have a key card to it, give it eight and a half.
Eight and a half, Loki.
I like that song, because I like that movie, the movie is really sweet, and every time I hear that song, it makes me think of the movie, so, give it a ten.
Alright, I, I do like that song, it's cool, I agree with Black Lab, it started off better than it ended, it was a little, I thought it was more repetitive than the Yumi track,
But it does remind me of Run Lola Run, which kicks a lot of ass, so I'm going to give that one an 8 as well.
So, that was Believe.
So now you can send your votes to us right now in the chat room.
Just private message them to me.
You can vote for Knight Rider, Connected, or Believe.
And we will count up your votes during this next break.
Jamie, what should we play during this next break?
If they don't vote for Knight Rider, David Hasselhoff will cry.
Hey, hey, hey.
No stacking the ballots.
No stacking the ballots.
Um, let's, uh, let's, um, go for something for... Just, just Black Lab, do we want to honor Black Lab's Weird Al request?
Yeah, let's play some Weird Al.
Alright, Weird Al it is.
We'll do some Weird Al.
We're just going to play this one song, we're going to come right back.
So you only have like two minutes to vote, so please hurry up and do so, because we have to come back and get in tonight's list list before the show's over.
So, uh, join us.
We'll be right back.
Eventually.
Unless we take a nap.
What you wanna do?
Wanna be hackers, codecrackers, slackers, wasting time with all the chatboondackers, 9 to 5 chillin' at music packers, workin' at a desk with a dumb little quacker, yeah, bein' the bills with my math program

My new computer's got the clocks.
It rocks, but it was obsolete before I opened the box.
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
Throw that junk away, man.
It's an antique.
Your desktop is a month old?
Well, that's great if you can use a not as heavy a paperweight.
My digital media is life-protective.
Every file inspected, no viruses detected I beta tested every operating system Gains popped to some and others I dissed them All your computer fashions, mine's multitasking
We even asked if you've got a flat screen monitor 40 inches wide I believe that your says it's a sketch on the side In a 30 qubit world, you're a qubit user You've got your own news group, all total losers Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax When you get your CPU in a box of Cracker Jacks Play me online, well you know that I'll beat you If I ever meet you, I'll control all the leads you What, what, what?
Hi, Jamie, do another spur of the moment promo for us, please.
If you don't listen to Orange Lounge Radio, you're a fucking loser.
Go figure.
Go figure.
I don't know.
That was weird.
I apologize to chat room.
25 shows and that's never happened to us, though.
On Under Station Live, that used to happen every other week.
I've been there for that a couple of times.
I apologize to you guys.
Just reconnect.
We should be back now.
I'm taking the last votes.
I may have missed some of your votes.
I may have missed some of your votes for...
Did I count that one already?
I think I did.
I just got one last vote.
This is interesting now because since I had a lapse there, I got some last-minute votes for the cage match, and that's caused it to have a tie.
Damn you.
Bite my ass.
So wait a minute.
This is very interesting.
We have a tie now.
Both edged out Knight Rider by one vote each.
Die.
Connected has three votes.
Believe has three votes.
We've never had a tie on this show.
I get to break the tie.
No, the way the tie is going to be broken is now we collectively here get to break the tie.
We're going to add votes one at a time.
All four of us.
All four of us.
So we might tie again and then in that case we'll have to get the people who voted for Knight Rider to re-vote.
I think we should just do rock, paper, scissors.
Yes, in that case if we tie again we're going to do rock, paper, scissors.
But let's see, we're going to add votes here in the room.
So this is between Connected and Believe.
You're going to vote for your own song.
You're going to let Jamie pick?
Because Black Lab wants a vote too.
Okay, we'll assume that Loki and I each vote for the songs we put in, so we cancel each other out.
So, Jamie.
I vote for Knight Rider.
Okay, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, then we do it.
Because otherwise, we don't want one person's answer skewing the other.
Intentionally fucking it up.
How am I going to fuck this up?
Alright, I did get the last two votes came in right after that lapse from people who hadn't voted yet.
I got the rest of your votes, I'm pretty sure.
So, here we go.
Okay, you got your written down, Black Lab?
Okay, let's see Jamie's.
Oh, Black Lab's got one vote there.
And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, we have another tie.
Nope, nope, nope, this is rock, paper, scissors time, Junkin, between myself and Loki.
Here we go.
Ready?
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Scissors, cuts, paper, and connected wins.
Very close, though.
Very close.
That means next week I have to pick a song that's going to last another two weeks.
Yep, that means, Jamie.
But, Jamie, you do have the longest, right?
Because, really, because of that holiday show we had in there, too, or those weeks we didn't do it, it was three weeks.
All right.
So, Connected wins the cage match by a hair, literally.
So, there it is.
Okay, now we're going to go right into listless.
We've got to hurry up and do this segment because we're almost out of time.
But we're going to do Listless tonight.
So I've got to clear out all these windows.
Jamie, tell them about tonight's Listless.
This Listless is going to be the best song, Baymani song, that was released in 2002.
Which is going to be Guitar Freak's 8th mix, Drum Mania's 7th.
Beatmania The Final, 2DX, 7th came out.
Yeah, 7th came out this year.
7th was early this year.
Yeah, it was early this year.
Then there's 8th Style and Max 2, yeah Okay, so all those things Also guitar Can you pop the music?
Max USA, yeah, Max USA Max USA, Guitar Freaks I already named it I forgot about Max USA, that might actually change my list a little bit Although you probably put the song I'm thinking of Okay, I forgot about Max USA, that's a good one
Uh... You also... Guitar Freak 7th Mix would count too.
As well as Beatmania 7th Mix, I believe.
Which is also being mentioned to me that Beat... Beatmania 3 in the final as well.
Which is being mentioned to me also, by the way, to remind everybody that it's coming out on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
Beatmania... Well, not DDR Extreme, but Beatmania 7th for the home system.
It's coming out.
Is it the final or is it 7th?
It's coming out for the home system.
Yeah, final's gonna be next year.
Alright.
Best Bae Money Song of 2002
I listened to it.
I kind of liked athletic songs before.
Just like from, like, beat, stage, mix that I'm so used to.
But when I heard, when they finally made the move to 7-key in 8-style, the War Game was one of my favorites now.
That's my number three.
War Game is his number three choice.
Loki!
Okay, it's one of my favorite songs on Beatmania 2DX, and I made a sim file for it.
The Sound of Goodbye.
The Sound of Goodbye.
That's a good song.
Jamie, what's your number three pick?
Guideca.
Guideca.
Did I spell it right?
Yes?
Yeah, I think it's two C's.
I did put two C's, yes.
Is it Guideca or Guideca?
Guideca.
G-I-U, my bad.
I couldn't see from over here.
Okay, my bad.
My number three pick was also The Sound of Goodbye.
I also put that as my number three pick.
Pick something different?
I'm afraid that you're... How about You Leave Me Alone?
I don't think it's on anyone's list, so I'm going to put that.
You Leave Me Alone.
From Max USA.
I never have an alternate.
Going to my number two choice...
It is the Guitar Freaks version of Breakdown.
It sounds much better than the DDR version.
Yeah.
Plus it has a funny little video thing.
Now, this is top Bomani game, or Bomani music.
Oh, okay.
Bomani music.
Alright, this year.
Alright, um, this changes mine then.
Um, Vanity Angel.
Which one was that from?
Euromix 2.
Oh.
Very interesting.
And the new DDR Extreme.
Alright, my number two song, because I am tax bitch, is Gravity.
Gravity.
Excellent choice.
Of course, because I chose it.
Thank you.
Stray, so you cannot vote for Onyx, please not so quick.
That's like four years old.
I'm older than that.
That's older than God.
Okay, um...
My number two.
No, there was a version of Do It All Night that was on Beatmania 5th Mix.
Anyway.
Anyway.
Rob.
Yes, hi, hello.
My number two pick is The Beauty of Silence from 2DX7SAL.
I love that song.
This is a pretty silent list.
The Beauty of Silence.
All of this silence and leaving people alone.
Oh, yay.
Well, okay.
My next one is actually something that sounded good at first, but then the next version of it that was released was better.
It's another one from 2DX8Style.
It's another version of Murmured Twins.
The piano scales in that song own you.
Alright, that's your number one pick.
Best but money song of the year, eh?
Alright, cool.
Alright, good song.
Loki.
Well, it was a really good song.
Steps could have been better.
It's Dark Black Forest.
Word.
That would have been on my list.
My number one song is not a tax song, nor is it Sakura.
Gasp.
Gasp.
It's Zero One.
Zero One?
Very interesting.
I've had that song on repeat for an hour before.
I'm surprised it wasn't Burning Heat.
I was expecting you to put Burning Heat.
You know, as much as I love Burning Heat...
And I actually crossed out Sakura.
Just because I can't, I have to pick it on musical merit.
That's too cliche.
She can't be that cliche.
I had to pick it on musical merit, and as much as I love Burning Heat, I've gotten really tired of hearing Burning Heat.
I mean, cause like, I went home after I showed Dan that video, the video for Burning Heat from 2DX.
He was freaking playing Gradius 2.
Word.
And...
I love Gradius 2, I love Burning Heat, but Zero One is just so much of a better song.
V-35 is my number one choice.
I love that song.
So, here is the list so far, before we eliminate one from the list.
Wargame, Sound of Goodbye, Guideca, You Leave Me Alone, The Guitar Freaks Version Breakdown, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Dark Black Forest, Zero One, and B-35.
Alright, this is going to be tough.
These are all really good songs, I have to say.
Chatroom wants to yell at us for a few things.
I'm going to tell you what the chatroom is yelling at us for that we did not put on the list.
Rainbow Flyer, Dark Tetsuya is having a cry for Rainbow Flyer.
Burning Heat, of course.
Crash.
And the Whistle Song.
Oh, fuck no, that song sucks.
Alright, those are things we're getting smacked for, so there you go.
Smack them back with the stinky trout.
Yeah, smack them back with our list.
Here we go.
Now we gotta eliminate.
Here we go.
Black Lab, you're first.
Okay, this is a tough one here.
Let's see.
Between two songs on there...
The one that I gotta take off, I just, I've heard it on the radio too much, and frankly I'm not too fond of it in 2DX either, it's the sound of goodbye, so I'm axing that.
You suck.
Um, here we go, already starting to eliminate all of Loki's lists, this seems to happen every week.
Um.
I wish there was a band against this group.
Bye bye Breakdown, you suck ass.
But it's a good song!
And what planet?
I actually like Breakdown.
Breakdown.
It's just fun and heavy.
Yeah, Breakdown's good, but it's not as good as a lot of the songs on this list.
I'm gonna get dirty looks for this.
And I actually like the song, but I don't think it should be among the best.
Dark Black Forest.
Sorry.
Because, you know, I heard it and I'm like, oh, well this is a cool song, and then I kept hearing it, and then people kept talking about it, and I'm like, pick a new song.
So, yeah.
Oh wow, Dark Black Forest goes bye-bye, I'm actually really surprised.
Now, as tempting as it is to remove Vanity Angel, because that was my impulse choice, I really, I can't do that to Loki, I can't.
And there's another one here staring me in the face that I can't let be on this list, because I think it's just overplayed and overrated.
I'm getting rid of Wargame.
and Rob and I have come out of this unscathed I wouldn't say that completely because two of those choices were on my list and I replaced them with other things so I think Jamie once again Jamie, you have this tendency to come through the listless segments without any of your songs getting eliminated I told you, I have good taste We have to plot against her one night and just take off all of her choices just to spite her As I kick you in the head repeatedly
People have worse tastes than you do.
That would be everybody in this room.
Remember Mexican tap water Loki?
That's all I ask.
Hey!
Okay.
I was trying to be funny.
It worked.
The end.
Well, let's just get the vote on.
Alright, let's get your vote on.
Jamie, would you like to read this list one more time?
Actually, I'm going to paste it in the chat room, and then you can read it, and then people can start sending me their votes.
Alright, we have Gudeca, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Rumor Twins, Another, Zero One, and V35.
Best Bomani song of 2002.
Might I point out, not a single one of those songs from Max 2.
Not a single one.
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
Six times in one day, in different places, and I was going to kill myself if I heard it again.
I heard the same thing happen to one of my Happy Hardcore pics.
The pics from Happy To Be Hardcore.
What song is it that I like?
Like the flowers need the rain.
I need you baby, I need you baby.
No, I know which one it was.
It was...
It wasn't Innovate, it was one of the other ones.
I don't remember.
Let Me Play.
It was Let Me Play.
But anyway.
Start voting.
Start voting.
In the meantime, we're going to play something.
I have a suggestion.
DarkTetsuya, he's pretty sad and pissy that we didn't put Rainbow Flyer on the list.
So I thought maybe, since it's on the 2DX8 style soundtrack, there's a long version of Rainbow Flyer.
Maybe we can play that.
Let's go for it.
To satisfy him.
Alright, we're going to play the long version of Rainbow Flyer.
The long version of Rainbow Flyer is kind of long.
So I think, you know what, no, the long version of Rainbow Flyer is a little bit too long, and it has Santa in it.
I don't know, I like Santa, but actually, we're almost at the end of the show, so we've got to keep this break short.
So we're going to play the short version of Rainbow Flyer, and we'll play the short version of Burning Heat, and we will come right back to finish this up, this show.
Enjoy, send me your votes right now, now, now, now.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
We're back and guess what?
We've had so many ties on our list tonight.
This is a very hard one.
This is like an everything tie.
This is like an everything's tie.
We want to take everybody's number two pick.
So send me your second choice, a second song you would vote for.
Here's the list one more time for your viewing pleasure in the chat room.
And Jamie, you want to read that one more time?
Videka, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Zero One, and Y35.
V35.
V35.
That's okay.
So everybody that's already voted, send us your number two pick.
So we'll take your number two pick and add a vote for that, and hopefully we'll be able to break the tie and get a winner.
In the meantime...
We're going to play one more song that was suggested, the best Mamani song of 2002.
However, it wasn't released in 2002, but just because we're funny.
Yes, we're funny.
Huh?
We're going to play it anyway.
Oh look, Loki's sleeping.
Okay, he's just resting his eyes.
Okay, here it is.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
I want to feel you as long as I can Head over heels, I'm breaking your feelings again
Thank you for watching!
I'm thinking of something, you know that makes me sick I'm feeling forever Naked
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
It's a good place to listen to the music.
You're listening to Orange Lounge.
I forget how to set that thing to do a new message.
Rayvar.
Turn off lights and do that.
It's pretty cool.
Rayvar.
Anyway, here we are back with the list.
Loki, you're going to read this list for us.
Tell our listening public, what came in third place for the best Bomani song of 2002?
Third place was Vanity Angel from Euromix 2.
Black Lab wanted to delete that, too.
Second best Beimane song of 2002.
Gravity from 7th Cell?
Yep, 7th Cell, Woot, and this is very surprising to me, but it did win by quite a few votes.
It was most people's second pick.
I was a little surprised at this, so it got a lot of tie-break votes.
The number one Beimane song of 2002.
You Leave Me Alone from D.R.U.S.A.
Or Max USA.
Yes.
Not USA.
Not D.R.U.S.A.
So, You Leave Me Alone, the number one Balani song in 2002.
What do you guys think of that?
I disagree.
I totally disagree.
But it's cool.
It's all about Kachaka.
Zero one.
War Game got erased.
I'm sorry.
Did I do that?
Well, guess what, guys?
It's the end of the show.
We're pretty much... We're wrapping up.
We are all out of show.
Oh no, we out of show.
So, um, I guess now is the point where I ask everybody, what is your final thought of the day?
Jamie, what is your final thought of the day?
Um, I want one of those Rayvar Light thingies.
You want a Rayvar Light?
Maybe for Christmas, Jamie, I will find you a Rayvar Light.
Um, okay.
Okay.
Loki.
Actually, I know what I want.
Black Lab, your final thought of the day.
No, no, there's something else I want.
What is it?
Sorry.
I want the leather-bound, um, hardcover copy of Grimms Fairytales.
Leather.
Leather!
Oh, yes, Black Lab, are you done?
I'm sorry?
Um, yeah.
Okay, Black Lab, your final thought of the day.
Final thoughts.
I'm coming out of my chocolate high now.
Yay.
Um, now I get to sleep and then wake up at 7am and drive home.
Yay.
Yay.
Okay, that's it.
And my final thought is... Oh!
This is my favorite show!
Wait!
No!
This is my favorite show!
Look!
It's my favorite show!
He's thinking it's a fortune cookie or something.
No, we have a fortune cookie.
We already have a fortune cookie.
Dedicated to the holidays.
Dedicated to the holidays.
My final thought of the day is... Lord of the Rings was very big.
Very, very big.
First of all...
Lord of the Rings is the name of the trilogy.
The Two Towers was very big.
Now the whole trilogy, I would agree, is very big.
Yes, that's what I meant, the whole trilogy is very big.
Lord of the Rings Part 2, the quest for more money.
That's Spaceballs Part 2, remember?
Word, word.
And I guess the only other final thought I can think of to us... Oh, you do, Jamie?
Yeah, I actually have one more.
It's a realization.
For anybody who's ever a Mel Brooks fan, anyone ever notice that the song at the end of History of the World Part 2...
I'm sorry, part one, the Jews in Space song.
Is the exact same tune that was used in Robin Hood Men in Tights for the Men in Tights song?
I did not know that.
It's the same tune?
Yeah, but it's the same tune as the Men in Tights song.
Fascinating.
Yeah, that's my final thought.
Riveting.
I thought of one more thing to say.
Yeah?
Zing.
Word!
Word!
Good night.
Now, since Eric Cartman can't seem to remember the words to Oh Holy Night, we're going to use a little shock therapy.
I'm going to give one of you children this cattle prod, and if Eric forgets any words, just shock him a little, okay?
Who wants the prod?
Me, me, me, me, me!
I want it, I want it, I want it!
Here you go, Kyle.
Why don't you take it?
Sweet!
Okay, Eric, whenever you're ready.
And...
Oh, what was that for?
I didn't screw up.
No, Kyle, you can't shock him unless he forgets the words.
Sorry, Mr. Garrison.
Oh, what was that for?
I didn't screw up.
Those aren't the words, Eric!
Ah!
Ah!
Very nice, Eric!
Okay, Eric, now we're going to do the French words.
What?
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
