[SPEAKER_22]: Message for you, son.

00:03.588 --> 00:04.529
[SPEAKER_19]: Attention!

00:05.450 --> 00:09.313
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:10.954 --> 00:15.998
[SPEAKER_22]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:19.631 --> 00:22.554
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:22.874 --> 00:26.057
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.637 --> 00:29.340
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.783
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.563 --> 00:33.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

00:34.184 --> 00:35.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.985 --> 00:36.646
[SPEAKER_04]: In this episode...

00:42.185 --> 00:45.326
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.627
[SPEAKER_13]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:13.381 --> 01:15.402
[SPEAKER_17]: We are live and this is episode number 24.

01:41.829 --> 01:49.893

01:50.853 --> 01:52.994
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

01:59.417 --> 02:00.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Burr, burr.

02:00.057 --> 02:01.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Burr, burr is the word.

02:02.158 --> 02:04.740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm freezing.

02:05.740 --> 02:06.380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm freezing.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know her better as DarkSakura.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.153
[SPEAKER_04]: In that corner, say hello to our tech massa, Loki!

02:16.433 --> 02:17.173
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everybody.

02:18.394 --> 02:22.255
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in studio with us tonight, nobody!

02:24.096 --> 02:24.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead air.

02:25.416 --> 02:26.437
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the three of us.

02:26.677 --> 02:32.259
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just feeling the love here tonight between the three of us.

02:32.559 --> 02:34.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're telling me they can't hear us.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my mic around.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

02:38.314 --> 02:42.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hi, our mics weren't loud enough during that whole intro, my bad, you wanna say hello again, Jamie?

02:43.897 --> 02:47.580
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I was cold, dammit And Loki, you wanna say hello again?

02:48.080 --> 03:06.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, whatever Sorry about that, we're still new at this, 24 episodes into this and we still don't know what the fuck we're doing Uh, anyway, we got a whole bunch of fun things to talk about tonight, but we'll get to that pretty soon Actually, I don't know what the hell we're gonna talk about tonight, I think it's just, uh, the holidays kill everything, don't they?

03:08.778 --> 03:09.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, sure.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's kind of panicking right now, by the way.

03:14.279 --> 03:14.819
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the matter?

03:15.920 --> 03:18.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh, my Tourney Mix 3 entry.

03:18.220 --> 03:18.820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all done.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to upload it.

03:20.661 --> 03:27.282
[SPEAKER_06]: My dial-up doesn't want to upload it, and I have to upload it here, but we can't because the stream, you know, might get cut out, so I'm stuck.

03:27.342 --> 03:28.123
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it on a CD.

03:28.163 --> 03:28.663
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all done.

03:29.043 --> 03:29.743
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't get to it.

03:32.699 --> 03:35.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we'll panic about Loki's situation a little bit.

03:35.728 --> 03:39.199
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we will be right back.

03:39.580 --> 03:39.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

04:03.113 --> 04:24.964

04:40.209 --> 04:41.651
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

05:17.728 --> 05:21.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here's something being brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

05:22.175 --> 05:26.381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some tracks from the new Good Cool compilation that was just recently released.

05:26.401 --> 05:28.063
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play a couple tracks here for you.

05:28.524 --> 05:34.052
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play Spooky and Shake It Down back to back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

08:44.577 --> 08:49.763
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna show you now That's all you need to set my body free I just wanna say

10:20.240 --> 10:21.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.961
[SPEAKER_04]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

10:30.082 --> 10:33.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10:33.263 --> 10:34.563
[SPEAKER_04]: That was horrible.

10:35.143 --> 10:36.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you you'd hate it.

10:36.463 --> 10:37.664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.

10:37.684 --> 10:38.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you ever heard that song?

10:38.884 --> 10:39.784
[SPEAKER_04]: That Missy Elliott song?

10:40.104 --> 10:40.644
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I listen to that?

10:40.664 --> 10:42.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know you don't listen to pop music, but whatever.

10:43.605 --> 10:45.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I have taste.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:48.586 --> 10:48.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

10:49.793 --> 10:56.301
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio And that was some stuff from the Good Cool CD, by the way

10:58.524 --> 11:00.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Spooky, and Shake It Down.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the two songs you heard back to back.

11:02.025 --> 11:03.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, Blake Down.

11:04.266 --> 11:07.107
[SPEAKER_04]: A song that I just pulled out of my ass because I didn't have anything else queued up.

11:08.388 --> 11:11.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the chat room seemed to enjoy that promo, so they got the joke.

11:12.549 --> 11:12.930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

11:13.670 --> 11:14.210
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

11:14.410 --> 11:15.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you still over there panicking?

11:16.331 --> 11:16.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

11:16.771 --> 11:24.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Twin tried to get you a... Twin couldn't shut his big fat mouth and try to get you a waiver or something, but now they said, no, you gotta get it in by midnight.

11:26.255 --> 11:26.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Eastern?

11:28.641 --> 11:33.807
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy said Eastern, but if you notice, their webpage doesn't say anything, so I don't know.

11:34.147 --> 11:34.848
[SPEAKER_04]: You could sue.

11:35.288 --> 11:36.370
[SPEAKER_04]: You should take him to Judge Judy.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.111
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a crap.

11:40.074 --> 11:43.257
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because the only one that matters is MakeEditGetPorn, right?

11:43.878 --> 11:44.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because we have a backup plan.

11:48.298 --> 11:49.119
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki's okay.

11:49.159 --> 11:53.222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just my roommate's got to get home in enough time for us to, you know, get into a system and upload something.

11:53.522 --> 11:53.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Break it.

11:54.123 --> 11:55.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, good suggestion.

11:56.124 --> 11:57.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of Judge Judy, Judge Jamie.

12:01.489 --> 12:02.189
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a bookmark?

12:02.289 --> 12:03.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, use that.

12:03.530 --> 12:03.950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hey.

12:05.011 --> 12:05.532
[SPEAKER_04]: So how was your week?

12:05.552 --> 12:07.113
[SPEAKER_17]: I spent reading Harry Potter during the break.

12:08.874 --> 12:12.297
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wearing this lovely new Slytherin scarf to go with your new obsession.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.212
[SPEAKER_18]: New Obsession.

12:14.712 --> 12:15.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somewhat.

12:16.374 --> 12:17.915
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out of this year though, isn't it?

12:17.935 --> 12:27.503
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very happy because this, it's not like the official one because the official ones are made really cheaply and kind of look stupid because they have like the house logo on them.

12:27.563 --> 12:28.424
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they look stupid.

12:29.085 --> 12:32.067
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is a handmade scarf in green and gray.

12:32.427 --> 12:37.452
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the Slytherin color so I wear it and it's made to look like the ones in the movies and it's warm and comfy.

12:38.957 --> 12:41.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in the chat room are indicating they've read all four books.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one's your favorite out of all the four books?

12:43.403 --> 12:44.384
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Goblet of Fire.

12:45.405 --> 12:46.587
[SPEAKER_18]: Goblet of Fire was the best.

12:47.048 --> 12:47.608
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, cool.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.331
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because of the whole ending.

12:49.491 --> 12:50.632
[SPEAKER_18]: My god, that was beautiful.

12:53.596 --> 12:55.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so did anyone do anything?

12:55.817 --> 12:59.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a special, special guest tonight in the chatroom.

12:59.219 --> 12:59.980
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me happy.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.881
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me moist as a snack cake, ladies and gentlemen.

13:02.241 --> 13:06.884
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Morpheus, my old buddy from Under Tradition Live, Travis, in the chatroom tonight.

13:06.944 --> 13:12.147
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's saying, oh, that reminds me, I need to send Jamie a pic of the Sakura Japanese restaurant sign out here.

13:12.327 --> 13:12.667
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

13:13.848 --> 13:15.469
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see signs with my name on them.

13:15.729 --> 13:20.593
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's saying, by the way, he also said that Understation Live 3.0 is going to be debuting in January.

13:21.153 --> 13:21.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting!

13:22.174 --> 13:24.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to UnderstationLive.org for all the details.

13:25.016 --> 13:28.599
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed last week's match game segment, we totally ripped that off of Understation Live.

13:28.759 --> 13:30.661
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a tribute, not a rip-off.

13:30.981 --> 13:31.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, a tribute.

13:32.162 --> 13:35.605
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was in turn a tribute to the classic game show, because it rules.

13:35.645 --> 13:38.127
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was just watching that the other day.

13:39.027 --> 13:39.608
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite.

13:39.648 --> 13:40.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Charles Nelson Reilly!

13:43.257 --> 13:48.060
[SPEAKER_15]: Biggest flaming homosexual in the 70s.

13:49.161 --> 13:57.366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my Mr. Spanky voice is inspired by Charles Nelson Reilly.

13:58.347 --> 14:01.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, Black Lab says, Game Show Network rules.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.230
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Show Network does rule.

14:03.990 --> 14:05.531
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Game Show Network.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Wintuition.

14:07.232 --> 14:07.953
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck is Wintuition?

14:07.973 --> 14:08.333
[SPEAKER_18]: That show sucks.

14:12.623 --> 14:15.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Summers is cool!

14:15.907 --> 14:17.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Summers is cool, but not on that show.

14:17.909 --> 14:19.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know who produces that show?

14:19.390 --> 14:20.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Who?

14:20.431 --> 14:22.173
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a Mark Goodson television production?

14:22.313 --> 14:25.417
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Henry Winkler or whatever.

14:25.917 --> 14:26.618
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fonz.

14:26.878 --> 14:27.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, The Fonz?

14:27.659 --> 14:28.380
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fonz.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.261
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

14:29.861 --> 14:31.363
[SPEAKER_18]: Because The Fonz is cool.

14:32.584 --> 14:34.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we actually have the Monty News to report.

14:34.526 --> 14:35.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

14:36.204 --> 14:38.006
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have some things going on in the Bomani community.

14:38.186 --> 14:40.208
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a big tournament on Friday in the Bay.

14:40.329 --> 14:43.312
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Miggle Evil Tournament 2, I believe it was called.

14:43.332 --> 14:44.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

14:44.173 --> 14:44.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Evil Tournament 2?

14:44.693 --> 14:45.074
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go.

14:45.474 --> 14:49.178
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go too, but that whole Friday thing meant, you know, we'd have to drive.

14:49.198 --> 14:57.487
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get anything out of work until 6.30, and I only, you know, didn't, I got off work at 5.30 and was there until nearly 6.30 because Dan wasn't off work yet.

14:57.587 --> 14:57.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

14:59.068 --> 15:00.829
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't want to drive out there in the rain.

15:00.849 --> 15:01.210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

15:01.250 --> 15:07.593
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably could have... Hearing that the whole damn thing started late, I probably could have made it in time, but I just didn't want to drive in the rain.

15:07.693 --> 15:13.316
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies to the folks there, but, you know, I just... I get all freaked out driving in storms.

15:14.076 --> 15:14.617
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have cried.

15:16.798 --> 15:21.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, oh yeah, we wanted to... We wanted to read the results to you from the tournament.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.343
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in Perfect Attack, fourth place went to Emphasis.

15:27.651 --> 15:28.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job, Emphasis.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Third place went to Virtu.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't call him the Max 300 King, or he'll kick your ass.

15:35.081 --> 15:36.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Second place went to Chubbs.

15:38.112 --> 15:38.412
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

15:38.872 --> 15:39.412
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

15:39.533 --> 15:42.473
[SPEAKER_04]: And first place, this is the hugest surprise of the century, Tigger.

15:43.834 --> 15:44.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

15:44.314 --> 15:44.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

15:45.054 --> 15:45.875
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god.

15:46.175 --> 15:46.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

15:46.575 --> 15:49.656
[SPEAKER_04]: They did this whole new little bracket thing though that was kind of cool.

15:50.776 --> 15:56.078
[SPEAKER_04]: What they do, and this is kind of cool, we should talk about this, kind of different ideas, ways to run a tournament.

15:56.558 --> 15:57.599
[SPEAKER_04]: They took a bracket of 16.

15:59.360 --> 16:14.637
[SPEAKER_04]: and what they did, you know, just like normal except instead of the person losing the last match just automatically getting second place what they did is they removed Tigger out of the bracket and replayed all the matches that would have been affected by his presence, basically.

16:15.397 --> 16:17.419
[SPEAKER_04]: and so they determined a second place that way.

16:17.679 --> 16:22.144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting the way it works, but it sounded very cool and I guess it worked out pretty well.

16:22.244 --> 16:22.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds neat.

16:23.004 --> 16:24.926
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was pretty cool.

16:26.067 --> 16:29.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyle, third place, went to a fellow called Hamsterhead.

16:31.532 --> 16:31.873
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy.

16:32.053 --> 16:33.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he do the hamster dance?

16:33.494 --> 16:34.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what?

16:36.176 --> 16:37.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, worst joke ever, sorry.

16:38.832 --> 16:53.372
[SPEAKER_04]: 2nd place went to 001 I thought it was 007 00 something got 2nd place DCB here typed all these results to me I thought it was 007 It could have been 001, I don't know In 1st place

16:54.734 --> 16:54.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

16:55.014 --> 16:55.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

17:21.781 --> 17:24.342
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, what else is there to talk about, but Monty News.

17:24.522 --> 17:28.583
[SPEAKER_04]: There are rumors saying that DDR Extreme is going to be released on Christmas.

17:29.343 --> 17:30.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys think there's any truth to that?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.883
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds kind of early to me.

17:33.284 --> 17:35.204
[SPEAKER_18]: Christmas is a commercial holiday in Japan.

17:35.704 --> 17:43.626
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, that's not far off from here, but even so, I don't think that they would put a significance in that date for the release of the game.

17:44.736 --> 17:49.540
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it sounds more like somebody's little fantasy than reality news, but who knows?

17:49.680 --> 17:53.442
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming from a fairly reputable source, so we shall see.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.486
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an early release date.

17:58.506 --> 18:03.029
[SPEAKER_18]: I remembered hearing that the official release date was sometime in early January, so that's what I'm going to stick with.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my story and I'm sticking to it, right?

18:05.011 --> 18:10.915
[SPEAKER_18]: Until I see something in Naoki's journal or something, which doesn't exist anymore.

18:11.380 --> 18:11.940
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, it's gone.

18:12.640 --> 18:12.780
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

18:12.860 --> 18:13.361
[SPEAKER_18]: Good!

18:14.021 --> 18:15.241
[SPEAKER_18]: But we lost our favorite joke.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.261
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should start one.

18:16.982 --> 18:18.702
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do a journal on behalf of Naoki.

18:19.322 --> 18:20.063
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we should.

18:20.343 --> 18:21.943
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've got an extra live journal code.

18:22.683 --> 18:24.624
[SPEAKER_04]: The lost deep thoughts of Naoki.

18:25.764 --> 18:26.284
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do that.

18:26.344 --> 18:27.085
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll set that up.

18:27.965 --> 18:28.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's do it.

18:28.865 --> 18:31.326
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make a Naoki live journal or something.

18:32.246 --> 18:35.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Now don't go getting ideas and taking the name before we can get to it or we'll kick your ass.

18:35.487 --> 18:36.087
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's ours.

18:36.147 --> 18:37.027
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll set you on fire.

18:37.268 --> 18:37.868
[SPEAKER_04]: We claim it.

18:38.328 --> 18:38.688
[SPEAKER_04]: Dibs!

18:42.389 --> 18:43.730
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not cold anymore, Emily.

18:43.911 --> 18:44.591
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not cold anymore?

18:44.611 --> 18:48.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because that's because we've got the lights in here that make everything hot.

18:50.137 --> 18:51.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I went shopping this week.

18:52.339 --> 18:52.919
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you buy?

18:53.860 --> 18:53.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

18:54.721 --> 18:56.122
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a present for Jamie, don't you?

18:56.202 --> 18:57.524
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Christmas gifts.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have Jamie open her Christmas present live on air.

18:59.666 --> 19:00.246
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be fun.

19:00.406 --> 19:03.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play some Christmas-y music to celebrate.

19:04.550 --> 19:05.852
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't open it until I play music.

19:07.694 --> 19:12.017
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now that I've got bills paid, I can go out and buy the rest of the presents that I need to.

19:13.658 --> 19:18.001
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's kind of scary when you get down to $200 in your bank account and you've got bills due.

19:19.302 --> 19:19.522
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah!

19:20.743 --> 19:23.244
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go, some nice Christmas music for you to be opening presents to.

19:26.327 --> 19:27.627
[SPEAKER_15]: Goddamn, what'd you tape this with?

19:28.508 --> 19:29.228
[SPEAKER_15]: Use packing tape.

19:33.482 --> 19:34.945
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like me to you.

19:35.487 --> 19:36.248
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god!

19:36.268 --> 19:38.252
[SPEAKER_06]: You're quite astute, aren't you?

19:39.515 --> 19:41.239
[SPEAKER_18]: I am going to be an Albrecht Van Heuven.

19:44.051 --> 19:55.295
[SPEAKER_18]: I have Quigley Down Under, Die Hard, Galaxy Quest, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and Dogma Special Edition.

19:55.435 --> 19:56.235
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a happy girl.

19:56.315 --> 19:58.856
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm drooled for hours.

19:59.496 --> 20:02.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to explain the Alan Rickman fetish to anybody that's new to our show?

20:03.877 --> 20:06.218
[SPEAKER_18]: He's hot, and I don't care how old he is, I love him.

20:08.539 --> 20:10.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know he was in Quigley Down Under.

20:10.139 --> 20:11.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't this movie really bad?

20:12.481 --> 20:13.662
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

20:13.702 --> 20:15.142
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Tom Selleck in it.

20:16.143 --> 20:19.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but, like, ever since Magnum P.I., Tom Selleck, like, sucks.

20:19.905 --> 20:21.025
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few I miss, though.

20:21.165 --> 20:21.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Blow Dry.

20:22.026 --> 20:22.926
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't find that one.

20:24.447 --> 20:24.987
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

20:25.027 --> 20:26.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Something tells me Jamie's going to be busy for a little while.

20:27.289 --> 20:30.950
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, no, what I just picked up on Laserdisc was Sense and Sensibility.

20:33.392 --> 20:35.733
[SPEAKER_04]: If that isn't a foofy chick flick, I don't know what is.

20:39.415 --> 20:40.615
[SPEAKER_17]: I can go squee now.

20:41.416 --> 20:41.696
[SPEAKER_17]: Squee!

20:43.567 --> 20:44.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

20:44.787 --> 20:49.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, feeling the love here on Orange Laundry Radio.

20:49.569 --> 20:51.169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting such great use out of my GameCube.

20:51.189 --> 20:52.389
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that thing more than anything.

20:52.469 --> 20:53.890
[SPEAKER_04]: I play Phantasy Star Online now.

20:53.910 --> 20:56.951
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out and bought Phantasy Star Online and that game just takes so much ass.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to get some DDR people going in on that.

21:01.752 --> 21:06.533
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little thread over on DDR Freak if you check the other games for them.

21:06.553 --> 21:08.594
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole little thread on Phantasy Star Online.

21:08.614 --> 21:12.055
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should check that out because they're trying to form a block and ship.

21:13.901 --> 21:15.582
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot, I love Christian Slater too

21:43.720 --> 21:44.381
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are you tired?

21:44.401 --> 21:49.027
[SPEAKER_18]: I was working on my website until 6 in the morning.

22:01.351 --> 22:01.871
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

22:01.911 --> 22:02.692
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to bed early.

22:16.349 --> 22:21.612
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Buddy Jabberwocky, who we did a fuck-off show with before Rocky yesterday.

22:21.772 --> 22:23.573
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was Friday night that we did the fuck-off show.

22:23.994 --> 22:32.098
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a little fuck-off show, and then we decided to go to Rocky last night with another friend of ours, Neil Bugt, who gives the web space, by the way.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.380
[SPEAKER_04]: He is my Sky.cx webmaster.

22:36.541 --> 22:39.903
[SPEAKER_04]: We all decided to go to Rocky in the Bay Area, because we don't have it here in SAC anymore.

22:40.783 --> 22:41.363
[SPEAKER_04]: and we had fun.

22:41.403 --> 22:45.645
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the second week in a row actually that I'd been because we all went the week before with Jabberwocky.

22:45.685 --> 22:46.065
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

22:46.725 --> 22:47.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

22:47.685 --> 22:56.108
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't get out of there until damn near 3 in the morning and then we had to go looking for diesel because Neil's car runs off of diesel fuel.

22:56.528 --> 22:57.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he have a Mercedes?

22:57.709 --> 23:00.870
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he has a Jetta, but it's one of those special ones that runs off of diesel fuel.

23:00.890 --> 23:04.451
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to drive for like 45 minutes to find a place open 24 hours that had diesel.

23:04.871 --> 23:08.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally found one and then we stopped at Denny's on the way back.

23:08.872 --> 23:12.195
[SPEAKER_04]: and Jabberwocky got into an argument with a waitress over covered and smothered.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't really an argument.

23:14.096 --> 23:15.597
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of a discussion.

23:17.699 --> 23:19.180
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds fascinating.

23:20.561 --> 23:20.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

23:20.982 --> 23:21.582
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crappy radio.

23:21.602 --> 23:22.623
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to bed.

23:22.643 --> 23:23.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

23:23.644 --> 23:24.104
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to bed?

23:24.144 --> 23:24.865
[SPEAKER_04]: What time did you go to bed?

23:29.921 --> 23:37.764
[SPEAKER_18]: I stayed up looking for this one picture that I could not find.

23:37.844 --> 23:44.026
[SPEAKER_18]: It was from, for anyone who's seen Chamber of Secrets, it was the scene with Snape dueling.

23:44.706 --> 23:51.569
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wanted to find him dueling and I couldn't find it until like 4.30am I found it.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.270
[SPEAKER_18]: I did a post at the time that I found it.

23:55.170 --> 23:56.951
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I finally finished my new icon set.

23:57.011 --> 23:59.513
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was on your own personal live journal.

23:59.593 --> 24:03.215
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, my own live journal, which if you want to know what it is, then go to the Orange Lounge community.

24:03.235 --> 24:04.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go to the Orange Lounge live journal.

24:05.656 --> 24:07.878
[SPEAKER_18]: And look on the friends list there and you'll find me.

24:10.039 --> 24:15.642
[SPEAKER_18]: I did a post on there about something that we're going to play on the show tonight for all the Animal Crossing addicts.

24:16.643 --> 24:18.164
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give an Animal Crossing update?

24:18.184 --> 24:19.785
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new in the world of Animal Crossing?

24:20.705 --> 24:21.626
[SPEAKER_18]: I want Olivia back.

24:22.911 --> 24:25.833
[SPEAKER_04]: We hung a sign out front of her house that calls her a bitch, because she is a bitch.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, we have a visitor!

24:27.494 --> 24:27.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Doorbell!

24:27.894 --> 24:28.735
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, doorbell!

24:29.535 --> 24:30.636
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another person.

24:30.656 --> 24:31.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's gonna walk through the door?

24:31.997 --> 24:38.642
[SPEAKER_18]: I have, for anyone who plays Animal Crossing, I'm sure you all go talk to KK, or Tote KK, as his name is.

24:39.883 --> 24:49.490
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can get a song from him, and he sings a little song and plays his little guitar, so I have one of his songs that, uh, I won't tell you what it is until right before we play it, unless you feel like playing it?

24:49.798 --> 24:52.762
[SPEAKER_04]: We will go to break very soon and we'll play that.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.885
[SPEAKER_04]: This break is going to be interesting because I'm actually going to leave.

24:57.467 --> 24:58.268
[SPEAKER_18]: We're kicking Rob out.

24:58.548 --> 25:00.330
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be gone for a little bit.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.972
[SPEAKER_18]: We're making him get us caffeine.

25:02.052 --> 25:02.833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we'll do though?

25:03.374 --> 25:07.799
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let Dave live out a little fantasy of his and we'll let him sit in the chair.

25:10.106 --> 25:10.486
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

25:10.906 --> 25:11.447
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

25:11.547 --> 25:12.687
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave has to sit on the floor.

25:12.747 --> 25:14.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Dave can sit on the floor and Loki can sit in the chair then.

25:14.928 --> 25:16.468
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to sit in the big chair.

25:16.508 --> 25:18.049
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to sit in the chair?

25:18.069 --> 25:18.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

25:18.209 --> 25:19.630
[SPEAKER_18]: You can sit in the big chair.

25:19.670 --> 25:20.890
[SPEAKER_18]: He gets to sit in this chair.

25:21.590 --> 25:22.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dave, what's up?

25:23.331 --> 25:24.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you, Rob.

25:24.091 --> 25:24.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dave.

25:24.391 --> 25:26.292
[SPEAKER_04]: The big chair is mine.

25:26.872 --> 25:27.492
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Dave.

25:27.512 --> 25:28.853
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

25:29.602 --> 25:30.342
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's new, Dave?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.984
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only one that's actually gone out and played any Bimani this week.

25:33.024 --> 25:34.265
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

25:34.305 --> 25:35.065
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you did, Loki?

25:35.825 --> 25:37.246
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday sucked ass.

25:37.506 --> 25:37.766
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

25:38.347 --> 25:41.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Friday was cool because I went to Golf Land and everyone was there.

25:41.568 --> 25:43.249
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, happy good time.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.851
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but everyone that normally goes there is there.

25:47.572 --> 25:50.053
[SPEAKER_18]: And then... What I said is I wasn't there, so it didn't count.

25:51.024 --> 25:51.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

25:52.225 --> 25:58.591
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then that was cool, and I said, well, Saturday is probably going to be the same because everyone goes that day too.

25:59.331 --> 26:03.755
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went there, and Will and Cedric were there for a little bit, and then they left, and I was all alone.

26:04.416 --> 26:07.538
[SPEAKER_04]: I played so much Initial D. All by yourself.

26:08.359 --> 26:09.900
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dancing all alone.

26:12.182 --> 26:14.064
[SPEAKER_17]: Were you dancing all alone in a kimono?

26:15.993 --> 26:16.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

26:17.454 --> 26:18.594
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle of Golfland.

26:20.115 --> 26:20.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

26:21.316 --> 26:24.297
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did the nicest thing I've ever done in DDR.

26:24.657 --> 26:27.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guy offered to pay, you know, to see me play.

26:27.359 --> 26:28.379
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, you're so good.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.000
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.661
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how that happens sometimes.

26:30.701 --> 26:31.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Was he hitting on you?

26:31.761 --> 26:33.942
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was like 50 with his family.

26:33.982 --> 26:35.063
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, you have to see this guy.

26:35.323 --> 26:36.083
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean nothing.

26:36.503 --> 26:37.484
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, I'll pay for it.

26:37.504 --> 26:37.964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.165
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did that, and I was like, wow.

26:41.146 --> 26:41.746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so nice.

26:43.667 --> 26:47.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, so like, you're nice because somebody gave you money to dance?

26:47.768 --> 26:48.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance, monkey, dance!

26:49.068 --> 26:50.408
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but see, I didn't accept the money.

26:51.269 --> 26:52.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

26:52.369 --> 26:55.110
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, damn, I'm so nice, and I'm so modest.

26:57.770 --> 27:00.391
[SPEAKER_18]: The last time somebody offered me tokens like that, I took them.

27:00.611 --> 27:02.631
[SPEAKER_04]: What in the hell is our chatroom doing right now?

27:03.071 --> 27:04.191
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just typing dots.

27:04.251 --> 27:05.112
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on drugs.

27:05.172 --> 27:07.352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kick the next person who types dots.

27:07.832 --> 27:08.552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Twin.

27:08.632 --> 27:09.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Twin, yay.

27:09.713 --> 27:10.153
[SPEAKER_17]: Kick him.

27:10.913 --> 27:11.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Good seed.

27:14.822 --> 27:15.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's 23rd Magus.

27:18.205 --> 27:19.386
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having a kickfest.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.629
[SPEAKER_05]: See, it's funny because the lag... Yeah, I know.

27:24.890 --> 27:25.630
[SPEAKER_04]: The lag didn't know.

27:27.631 --> 27:28.892
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't even know about it.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.014
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he did it again.

27:32.295 --> 27:34.016
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's just... Oh, no.

27:34.036 --> 27:35.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Mama's playing cop for me.

27:36.018 --> 27:36.358
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

27:37.890 --> 27:51.476
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd want to join our chatroom and join in the fun of getting booted repeatedly when you do bad things, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx.

27:52.036 --> 27:52.837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that simple.

27:52.857 --> 27:55.798
[SPEAKER_04]: And then click on chat, and all of the rules you need are right there.

27:56.899 --> 27:57.339
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

27:59.274 --> 28:03.297
[SPEAKER_04]: God, our chat room is just... They're all on PMS tonight or something.

28:03.317 --> 28:04.238
[SPEAKER_15]: No, everyone's on Happy Crack.

28:05.399 --> 28:07.040
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of Happy Crack, I need Twinkies.

28:07.321 --> 28:09.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Happy Crack, I'm going to make a run right now.

28:09.882 --> 28:10.983
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to take a quick break.

28:11.284 --> 28:14.546
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back, and when we come back, I'm not going to be here.

28:14.666 --> 28:18.689
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll get your sim update, and who knows what's going to happen while I'm not here.

28:19.270 --> 28:19.630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

28:19.670 --> 28:20.170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared.

28:20.391 --> 28:24.734
[SPEAKER_18]: During this break, though, we are going to give everyone a little taste of Animal Crossing.

28:24.814 --> 28:28.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we will have you enter that just one minute.

28:29.297 --> 28:31.479
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ KK, if ever you're interested in pulling it up

28:57.956 --> 29:00.497
[SPEAKER_18]: and go ahead and give a listen.

29:00.517 --> 29:03.299
[SPEAKER_18]: This is actually the one with him singing it, so enjoy.

29:03.699 --> 29:08.741
[SPEAKER_04]: And also during this break, we'll play one more track from the Good Cool CD and some other random crap.

29:08.781 --> 29:09.001
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy!

29:25.555 --> 29:34.082
[SPEAKER_19]: Quack, quack, me, oh, me, me, oh, oh, me, oh Me, me, quack, quack, oh, oh, oh Quack, la, me, quack, oh

29:35.322 --> 29:36.002

29:56.553 --> 29:57.534
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

[SPEAKER_19]: Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue, Cue

30:52.501 --> 30:53.202
[SPEAKER_19]: and many more.

[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, what a groove!

31:23.219 --> 31:29.521
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what a groove!

31:29.961 --> 31:35.982
[SPEAKER_11]: A groove, groove, groove like this makes your body move, move, move!

31:36.002 --> 31:43.084
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to feel the music, feel the way it flows, feel the vibrations from your head down to your toes!

34:03.502 --> 34:05.304
[SPEAKER_00]: I am DJ Sender!

34:06.024 --> 34:09.727
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, in the club in Shibuya, the most popular DJ is me!

34:09.807 --> 34:10.148
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up!

34:10.188 --> 34:10.748
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of here!

34:11.088 --> 34:13.250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just a swimmer.

34:13.330 --> 34:16.012
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the most groovy DJ right now.

34:16.213 --> 34:17.414
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Pani Kei!

34:17.434 --> 34:18.054
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a cool play!

34:18.094 --> 34:18.755
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a cool play!

34:38.155 --> 34:38.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

34:38.795 --> 34:39.276
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Trombone!

35:27.375 --> 35:27.736
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

36:33.061 --> 36:35.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

36:35.224 --> 36:38.970
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on girl, let me rock your world Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

36:39.190 --> 36:40.973
Come on girl, let me rock your world

37:15.499 --> 37:16.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're back and stuff.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.460
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the chair.

37:33.666 --> 37:35.067
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

37:35.507 --> 37:35.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair!

37:36.107 --> 37:36.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

37:36.668 --> 37:36.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

37:36.968 --> 37:37.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

37:37.688 --> 37:37.968
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

37:38.188 --> 37:38.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

37:38.889 --> 37:39.729
[SPEAKER_18]: That's old.

37:40.309 --> 37:40.670
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like AX2000.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.351
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have nothing.

37:44.231 --> 37:44.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

37:44.792 --> 37:45.512
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, you suck.

37:46.432 --> 37:46.873
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.513
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that scarf.

37:48.553 --> 37:49.254
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool.

37:49.274 --> 37:50.675
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, he's checking out my scarf.

37:50.695 --> 37:52.616
[SPEAKER_17]: I can get you a Ravenclaw one.

37:53.636 --> 37:54.476
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want.

37:54.637 --> 37:56.878
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob didn't leave fast enough, so we had to kill him.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I buried his body.

37:58.579 --> 37:59.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't really bury it yet.

37:59.739 --> 38:01.980
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Rob's getting me chocolate, so I'm happy.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.361
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're getting boba later.

38:04.644 --> 38:06.289
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to Tapioca Express afterwards.

38:09.042 --> 38:11.643
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the Max 2 that's been recently installed.

38:11.683 --> 38:12.444
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that's local news.

38:12.944 --> 38:21.348
[SPEAKER_18]: The Max 2 supposedly has been upgraded over at Tapioca Express in Davis, so we're going to go check out that action.

38:21.628 --> 38:22.529
[SPEAKER_18]: How far away is that?

38:23.109 --> 38:25.170
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a 30 minute drive from here.

38:25.750 --> 38:26.351
[SPEAKER_18]: Something like that.

38:26.531 --> 38:27.091
[SPEAKER_18]: Not too far away.

38:27.731 --> 38:30.313
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, we need our update, our sim update thingy.

38:31.173 --> 38:34.235
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I get out of school and college...

38:35.015 --> 38:35.475
[SPEAKER_05]: and like 8 years.

38:35.515 --> 38:36.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

38:37.036 --> 38:39.238
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, call me in 8 years.

38:39.258 --> 38:40.639
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be 20 with the cane.

38:41.559 --> 38:41.919
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like 22.

38:41.979 --> 38:42.880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

38:46.602 --> 38:47.423
[SPEAKER_18]: Sim update time.

38:47.463 --> 38:47.723
[SPEAKER_18]: Whee!

38:48.403 --> 38:49.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

38:49.464 --> 38:53.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously the most important thing that's going on right now is Tourney Mix 3.

38:54.087 --> 38:55.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadline is today.

38:55.868 --> 38:57.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, deadline is in.

38:58.442 --> 39:01.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm like about an hour and 45.

39:01.524 --> 39:01.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

39:03.626 --> 39:04.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid dial-up.

39:04.687 --> 39:14.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so there's going to be, next week is going to be the official judging of it, and then you'll see on the 22nd, actual submissions come online for you to check out.

39:14.814 --> 39:17.236
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for that.

39:18.037 --> 39:20.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from that, not too much going on.

39:21.179 --> 39:27.464
[SPEAKER_06]: They finished the Parapar graphics for Stepmania, so you'll see that in a new update probably soon.

39:28.404 --> 39:29.505
[SPEAKER_06]: and DWI.

39:29.525 --> 39:33.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really been paying attention to what kind of updates are going on there, so no big deal.

39:34.348 --> 39:43.253
[SPEAKER_06]: DDRUK finally finished updating all their booster packs, so you've got full sets of pretty much all the official files with the official graphics for the most part.

39:44.974 --> 39:46.314
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check those out for sure.

39:47.815 --> 39:49.896
[SPEAKER_06]: And aside from that, not too much else.

39:50.956 --> 39:56.337
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, more files on DDR Maniacs, so go check those out, some pretty cool ones.

39:56.557 --> 39:58.658
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm redoing my entire site.

39:58.698 --> 40:01.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not my entire site, but the download section of it.

40:01.399 --> 40:06.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got, I'm sorting them all into, you know, 2DX style categories.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually going to be doing a mass upload of a bunch of different files.

40:10.161 --> 40:12.441
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll see a bunch of those coming soon.

40:12.821 --> 40:14.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I only have a few of them done.

40:15.682 --> 40:17.483
[SPEAKER_06]: and David is trying to pretend he's so sweet.

40:17.703 --> 40:18.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what?

40:18.264 --> 40:18.784
[SPEAKER_06]: He sucks.

40:19.384 --> 40:19.725
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

40:21.105 --> 40:22.966
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't snore when you talk.

40:23.967 --> 40:25.468
[SPEAKER_18]: So don't snore when Loki talks.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.548
[SPEAKER_06]: Not out loud, at least.

40:26.669 --> 40:29.930
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you saying that you snore when I talk?

40:30.170 --> 40:30.891
[SPEAKER_06]: When he talks.

40:31.131 --> 40:32.132
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's because you're boring.

40:33.452 --> 40:34.453
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't get a scarf then.

40:35.692 --> 40:36.372
[SPEAKER_06]: I am boring.

40:37.333 --> 40:44.336
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, you know, deadline for my make etiquette porn contest, if I remember correctly, is next Sunday.

40:45.437 --> 40:48.258
[SPEAKER_06]: So, get your edits in, if you haven't yet.

40:48.638 --> 40:52.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave has entered, and if no one else enters, he will sweep the whole competition.

40:54.441 --> 40:55.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone else entered yet?

40:56.502 --> 40:56.682
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

40:57.903 --> 41:00.564
[SPEAKER_05]: I will win, and all the porn will be mine!

41:01.144 --> 41:01.965
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I'll enter.

41:02.285 --> 41:02.705
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

41:02.725 --> 41:04.886
[SPEAKER_18]: I want porn.

41:05.684 --> 41:08.005
[SPEAKER_18]: I want man porn, but I want porn.

41:09.146 --> 41:12.248
[SPEAKER_18]: If I get boob porn, then I can give it to people.

41:13.268 --> 41:15.289
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave, you don't get any porn.

41:15.329 --> 41:15.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Dave.

41:17.390 --> 41:18.091
[SPEAKER_18]: No porn for you.

41:18.671 --> 41:19.371
[SPEAKER_18]: No porn for you!

41:20.532 --> 41:21.813
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not entering for the porn.

41:21.853 --> 41:23.433
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm entering for the recognition of winning.

41:23.473 --> 41:25.094
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't have the chair back.

41:25.174 --> 41:26.355
[SPEAKER_05]: The porn is a bonus.

41:26.915 --> 41:28.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap, that was fast.

41:30.082 --> 41:31.243
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's my cupcakes?

41:31.844 --> 41:40.591
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been back before the break was even finished if that stupid bitch in front of me in line knew how to use her goddamn ATM card in the little slider.

41:41.331 --> 41:42.973
[SPEAKER_04]: My preemptive FU of the week.

41:43.013 --> 41:45.014
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you need to save it for the FUs of the week.

41:45.675 --> 41:47.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, I'll save it, but oh man, what a bitch.

41:47.877 --> 41:49.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should just do the FUs of the week.

41:49.258 --> 41:50.639
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got to wait for the chat room to submit theirs.

41:50.659 --> 41:51.680
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to give them time to send theirs.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.341
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do the FUs of the week right now?

41:54.588 --> 41:56.710
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do them in a minute, but Matt's still finishing.

41:56.770 --> 41:57.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

41:57.851 --> 41:58.752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rob!

41:58.812 --> 42:02.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week over private message, or send them to Jamie's name right now.

42:04.276 --> 42:05.898
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, okay, yeah, change your nick back to Sky.

42:05.938 --> 42:09.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week to Sky, and we'll get to those right after Loki finishes.

42:10.022 --> 42:12.083
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, um... But I get the chair again.

42:12.744 --> 42:14.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I guess I get the floor again.

42:16.107 --> 42:17.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, the floor is cool.

42:17.408 --> 42:18.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Word up for the floor.

42:19.195 --> 42:19.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Floor!

42:19.955 --> 42:20.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no.

42:21.476 --> 42:22.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

42:22.956 --> 42:25.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, so you'll probably see some more stuff on there.

42:25.137 --> 42:30.219
[SPEAKER_06]: I know for a fact that I'm going to have Alien World, um, the DWI for that coming up on my site.

42:30.519 --> 42:36.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm supposed to be getting some DWIs for, um, Starry Eye Surprise and, um, a few other songs.

42:36.601 --> 42:38.822
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll be seeing those also hosted on my site.

42:38.882 --> 42:40.982
[SPEAKER_06]: So just check for that, and that's it.

42:43.603 --> 42:44.944
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're ready to go.

42:44.984 --> 42:45.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, food!

42:46.900 --> 42:47.460
[SPEAKER_06]: I got food.

42:47.701 --> 42:48.701
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, this is awesome.

42:48.941 --> 42:54.164
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob came back with chocolate cupcakes for me, and now my scarf is being worn by Dave.

42:54.624 --> 42:56.946
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're not Slytherin, yo.

42:57.206 --> 42:58.767
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what I brought back for Dave?

42:59.487 --> 43:00.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing!

43:00.348 --> 43:00.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha!

43:02.649 --> 43:03.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

43:03.289 --> 43:03.850
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me my scarf.

43:03.870 --> 43:04.970
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need anything.

43:05.731 --> 43:08.392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm content with sitting here on the floor.

43:08.432 --> 43:09.293
[SPEAKER_17]: Wearing my scarf.

43:09.513 --> 43:09.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

43:09.973 --> 43:11.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it matches my sweatshirt.

43:12.254 --> 43:12.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

43:12.935 --> 43:15.196
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're one of those boring old Ravenclaws.

43:15.771 --> 43:16.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Ravenclaw are tight.

43:16.952 --> 43:17.452
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they're not.

43:17.492 --> 43:18.012
[SPEAKER_18]: They're nerds.

43:18.192 --> 43:19.073
[SPEAKER_05]: Cho Chang, like what?

43:19.553 --> 43:20.393
[SPEAKER_18]: They're nerds.

43:21.834 --> 43:23.035
[SPEAKER_18]: And now in Harry Potter talk.

43:23.555 --> 43:25.316
[SPEAKER_05]: They better have a hot person play her.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.097
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, Rob got fluffy balls.

43:28.377 --> 43:29.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball, ball, ball.

43:30.498 --> 43:32.419
[SPEAKER_18]: And Propel, because Propel is the drink of the gods.

43:33.460 --> 43:35.741
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only had it once, and that was when I had some of yours.

43:36.365 --> 43:37.366
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want some Propel?

43:37.886 --> 43:38.106
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

43:38.506 --> 43:38.686
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

43:41.868 --> 43:43.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's being mean to me tonight.

43:43.289 --> 43:44.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Have my other bottle of Propel.

43:45.050 --> 43:45.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway.

43:46.611 --> 43:51.174
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that somebody in the chat room wanted to mention in your sim update, I believe this was sent to me by Twen.

43:52.115 --> 43:54.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Feet of Fury got an update to it, and this is really interesting.

43:55.217 --> 43:59.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no update has been released, but there was some news on it.

43:59.379 --> 44:01.281
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me see if I can load up that news.

44:01.301 --> 44:02.842
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go to one of my websites here so I can get the...

44:03.542 --> 44:05.382
[SPEAKER_04]: The quote on that, because this is going to be interesting.

44:05.402 --> 44:08.563
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that begs being talked about here before we get into the FUs of the week.

44:08.623 --> 44:10.264
[SPEAKER_18]: It's begging with a cup and everything.

44:10.724 --> 44:12.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's begging for your dollars.

44:12.944 --> 44:14.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, it's begging for a dollar.

44:15.565 --> 44:21.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is what the latest update was posted over at CAgames.com, I believe is the site, correct?

44:21.726 --> 44:22.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, CAgames.com.

44:23.287 --> 44:25.007
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the folks that make Feet of Fury.

44:25.047 --> 44:29.168
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a DDR emulator for the Dreamcast, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the big program.

44:29.928 --> 44:33.331
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think our consensus was most of the people didn't particularly care for it.

44:33.731 --> 44:37.654
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought for a first mix it was okay, but it had a long way to go.

44:37.714 --> 44:39.075
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people here didn't care for it.

44:39.115 --> 44:42.078
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR's kind of surpassed that right now, but I don't know.

44:42.578 --> 44:47.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I think homegrown Dreamcast stuff is just cool to begin with.

44:47.462 --> 44:50.584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like trying to play SSR on Happy Craft, because everything's flat.

44:51.485 --> 44:52.405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm being corrected.

44:52.485 --> 44:54.987
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an emulator, it's a simulator.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.208
[SPEAKER_04]: Get over it.

44:56.348 --> 44:56.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

44:57.049 --> 44:57.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

44:58.910 --> 45:00.531
[SPEAKER_04]: It emulates the style of DDR.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.669
[SPEAKER_04]: The bigger news is that the finished Feet of Fury game will be sold rather than posted online.

45:40.798 --> 45:46.160
[SPEAKER_04]: They may do another preview version at that time with more bug fixes, better hardware support, better swap CD options.

45:46.560 --> 45:53.983
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you get the real press CD, the sold one, you're going to be treated to a lot more songs, more gameplay modes, and etc.

45:54.043 --> 45:56.384
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're looking for a lawsuit.

45:57.885 --> 46:02.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of... They're begging to get a lawsuit, I agree.

46:02.447 --> 46:04.868
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, unless it's radically different from DDR.

46:04.948 --> 46:06.448
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be in some trouble for doing that.

46:06.508 --> 46:10.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, Pump It Up survived this whole time, who knows.

46:11.917 --> 46:17.103
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also all the other clones out there that no one hears about that lurk around on eBay.

46:18.364 --> 46:20.807
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Technomotion, Easy To Dancer.

46:20.827 --> 46:22.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but they're not trying to sell Step Mania.

46:24.210 --> 46:26.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I mean, this is really the same.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.715
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, pump it up at least at different notes.

46:28.735 --> 46:30.337
[SPEAKER_05]: This is still up, down, left, right.

46:30.397 --> 46:31.198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

46:32.403 --> 46:36.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, remember though, Feedy Fury, the first thing it was, it didn't even have normal DDR mode.

46:36.645 --> 46:40.227
[SPEAKER_04]: All it was was a Dance Magic-like mode, which had different things.

46:40.647 --> 46:54.114
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looked different, but, I mean, at its concept, if Konami wanted to proceed with, you know, trying to get something against them, it probably could do it, because it is very similar to Dance Magic, which was in Disney's mix that they released here in the U.S.

46:54.174 --> 46:54.434
[SPEAKER_04]: already.

46:55.335 --> 46:56.375
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear it for Disney's Rave.

46:57.676 --> 46:59.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in the U.S., it's Mix.

47:00.017 --> 47:02.098
[SPEAKER_15]: I happen to have Disney's Rave, so... I know, I know.

47:02.628 --> 47:04.029
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a Disney mix as well.

47:04.849 --> 47:07.290
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually come to think of it, I got my Disneys right from you, didn't I?

47:08.330 --> 47:08.550
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

47:09.751 --> 47:13.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of whether they're going to get busted or not, we will be looking forward to that release.

47:14.072 --> 47:18.114
[SPEAKER_04]: We will, I'm sure, get a copy of A Feet of Fury and talk about it.

47:18.874 --> 47:19.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob will.

47:19.935 --> 47:20.575
[SPEAKER_04]: We will not.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.816
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of us are not going to get it.

47:23.056 --> 47:24.757
[SPEAKER_04]: I will stay on top of it and look at it.

47:26.690 --> 47:28.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, because I don't use my Dreamcast for anything.

47:29.831 --> 47:32.112
[SPEAKER_18]: I use my Dreamcast to play Rainbow Cotton.

47:32.132 --> 47:33.453
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I use my Dreamcast for?

47:34.633 --> 47:36.254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I use it to play Nintendo games.

47:36.494 --> 47:38.675
[SPEAKER_04]: For Nester DC, that's all I use my Dreamcast for.

47:38.695 --> 47:39.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Soul Calibur.

47:39.436 --> 47:40.296
[SPEAKER_18]: I play Puyo Da.

47:41.216 --> 47:41.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Puyo Da's cool.

47:41.817 --> 47:42.517
[SPEAKER_18]: Puyo Da's awesome.

47:45.338 --> 47:49.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had some questions in the chatroom wanting me to ask Loki about this, if you've seen this.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, all of us, really.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.601
[SPEAKER_04]: The Flash Flash Revolution, have you seen that?

47:52.961 --> 47:53.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

47:53.542 --> 47:54.002
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

47:54.833 --> 47:57.055
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like flash games, especially on dial-up.

47:58.937 --> 48:01.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Flash games all suck, and the same with the DDR.

48:01.959 --> 48:03.861
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it, and I was like, eh, whatever.

48:04.221 --> 48:06.624
[SPEAKER_06]: It took forever to load, and it wasn't that impressive.

48:06.664 --> 48:16.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I mean, I saw it, and it was basically, like, there's nothing special about it, it's just downloaded...

48:17.333 --> 48:21.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Choppie, DDR, Emulator, Simulator, whatever it's called.

48:22.638 --> 48:29.205
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has less songs, less variety than something like Styliania, so I don't see why you would play that.

48:29.325 --> 48:32.068
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that like that Delight Delight reduplication, that old, old one?

48:32.088 --> 48:33.989
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's just like you download...

48:35.671 --> 48:36.892
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

48:55.770 --> 48:57.731
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like, I don't know, a couple years ago.

48:58.432 --> 49:01.854
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check that out if you really want to play this stupid Flash crap.

49:02.354 --> 49:04.555
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's nothing really special about it.

49:04.575 --> 49:05.896
[SPEAKER_18]: You can play Dance Dance Karnov.

49:06.416 --> 49:09.998
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really choppy, and I don't think it would sync too well.

49:10.999 --> 49:11.579
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no.

49:12.380 --> 49:14.201
[SPEAKER_18]: How many people remember Dance Dance Karnov?

49:15.301 --> 49:15.782
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

49:16.502 --> 49:19.584
[SPEAKER_18]: Karnov was an old Nintendo game that really sucked.

49:20.655 --> 49:24.140
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they did like a DDR flash simulator with Carnov.

49:24.380 --> 49:25.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but do you know what's cool?

49:25.902 --> 49:30.889
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, I saw DDR on the graphing calculator, which I'd never seen before.

49:31.049 --> 49:32.771
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's like really retarded.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.175
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the funniest thing I've heard in my entire life.

49:35.555 --> 49:36.235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it was funny, though.

49:36.255 --> 49:42.679
[SPEAKER_18]: At least with pole position, you could, like, play it and it had made sense, but DDR, no music, hello, what's it gonna do, click at you?

49:43.039 --> 49:46.381
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR, no music, no flashing, just the arrow scrolled to the screen.

49:46.702 --> 49:48.723
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one BPM for all four songs.

49:49.283 --> 49:50.424
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the notes on basic.

49:50.484 --> 49:51.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you're incorrect.

49:51.905 --> 49:57.548
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do sound with the calculator, but you have to build your own... I have a message.

49:57.568 --> 50:01.350
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a message for the person that created DDR for the graphing calculator.

50:01.450 --> 50:01.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd!

50:02.210 --> 50:02.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life!

50:03.311 --> 50:04.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a fucking life.

50:04.972 --> 50:05.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Go outdoors.

50:05.912 --> 50:07.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell a flower or something.

50:07.433 --> 50:08.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a girlfriend.

50:08.593 --> 50:09.293
[SPEAKER_04]: A boyfriend.

50:09.333 --> 50:09.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

50:10.414 --> 50:11.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Go out and get laid.

50:13.255 --> 50:14.575
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody got bored in calculus.

50:16.136 --> 50:16.936
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say Jesus.

50:17.917 --> 50:18.657
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a pretzel.

50:20.698 --> 50:21.078
Thank you.

50:21.318 --> 50:23.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, yeah, secretly I'll admit, yeah, it's kind of cool.

50:23.139 --> 50:23.559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.

50:25.475 --> 50:28.718
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that God didn't leave the window on when I left.

50:29.239 --> 50:31.080
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I closed it.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.422
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I closed it.

50:32.562 --> 50:34.504
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to sit... Otherwise they're going, oh my god.

50:35.124 --> 50:36.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm not even going to say it just in case.

50:37.427 --> 50:42.532
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to sit in chemistry class and play pole position on a graphing calculator.

50:43.132 --> 50:43.693
[SPEAKER_18]: That was cool.

50:44.133 --> 50:48.898
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to sit there and calculus and copy all the formulas that we were supposed to memorize for the test onto the calculator.

50:48.938 --> 50:49.959
[SPEAKER_18]: I had them memorized anyway.

50:51.368 --> 50:55.632
[SPEAKER_18]: To this day, I still remember that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

50:56.412 --> 50:58.194
[SPEAKER_04]: That is astonishing.

50:58.214 --> 50:58.194
6.022.

50:58.794 --> 50:59.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Astonishing.

50:59.575 --> 50:59.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

51:00.796 --> 51:01.837
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been talking in the chat room.

51:01.857 --> 51:04.639
[SPEAKER_18]: It has come up lately, but when I was in school, we learned it was just 6.02.

51:05.901 --> 51:09.784
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were talking about Flash, Last Revolution, somebody brought up Black Lab Invoke This.

51:09.824 --> 51:14.868
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, Flash ruined the Internet, which kind of goes back to what we were talking about a couple nights ago on the Fuck Off show.

51:15.329 --> 51:16.670
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the Internet?

51:17.030 --> 51:18.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, actually, I was just...

51:20.288 --> 51:22.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop-up ads ruin the internet, yes.

51:22.570 --> 51:28.436
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted some links actually on our website about stupid knock-off DDR things.

51:29.056 --> 51:37.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone actually came up with a full-body DDR thing with motion-captured sensors on his body for DDR.

51:39.265 --> 51:39.766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called...

51:41.618 --> 51:43.721
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making obscene shapes out of pretzels.

51:43.761 --> 51:44.762
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got boobs and penises.

51:44.802 --> 51:45.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ignore them, Loki.

51:45.603 --> 51:45.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue.

51:46.364 --> 51:46.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue.

51:47.425 --> 51:48.166
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

51:48.286 --> 51:49.628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... What?

51:51.630 --> 51:52.411
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretzel.

51:53.853 --> 51:54.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so...

51:55.899 --> 52:02.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's like almost if you cross DDR with, like, say... Actually, it was more like Samba de Amigo.

52:04.384 --> 52:05.265
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very much like that.

52:05.345 --> 52:07.606
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how you have to strike poses and stuff with that?

52:08.006 --> 52:08.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much like that.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.348
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to match poses, that thing did.

52:10.388 --> 52:14.010
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a music game like that that someone is supposed to develop.

52:14.190 --> 52:15.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I read there was another thing.

52:16.091 --> 52:21.374
[SPEAKER_06]: I found that someone's developing a DDR sim for PS2 Linux.

52:23.055 --> 52:23.436
[SPEAKER_21]: Nerd!

52:23.456 --> 52:23.576
[SPEAKER_21]: Nerd!

52:26.124 --> 52:26.404
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, Konami.

52:54.574 --> 53:00.555
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been given a flash that we have to play over the internet because it'll make us cool or something like that.

53:01.155 --> 53:09.577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Spider-Man, and if this is that Spider-Man's gay thing, I'm going to start punching people randomly in the chat room because that thing's stupid.

53:09.817 --> 53:11.058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you're getting banned.

53:12.178 --> 53:19.680
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is that stupid Spider-Man is gay thing... We're waiting for this to load here.

53:22.385 --> 53:27.227
[SPEAKER_04]: 83, 86, 88, 94 Hey, shut up, I'm doing a show here.

53:30.768 --> 53:31.549
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

53:32.089 --> 53:33.309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in a foreign language.

53:40.732 --> 53:41.433
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

53:42.873 --> 53:45.894
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the worst flash I've ever seen.

53:47.815 --> 53:49.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, wait, hold on, hold on.

53:49.256 --> 53:49.976
[SPEAKER_04]: That's getting a kick.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.434
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what the best flash was, though, that was along those lines?

53:55.094 --> 53:58.937
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the Mega Man one where he danced to Twinby from 2DX.

54:00.478 --> 54:04.300
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I kicked EOSFVB for that worst flash ever.

54:04.620 --> 54:06.041
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so funny.

54:08.643 --> 54:10.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob, I actually learned the whole dance now.

54:11.284 --> 54:15.107
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the whole dance, so you'll have to play that intro, or that promo when we come back.

54:15.287 --> 54:16.508
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, maybe we will, maybe we will.

54:16.868 --> 54:17.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, FUs.

54:17.949 --> 54:19.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yes, let's do the FUs of the week.

54:21.063 --> 54:22.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do I have FUs today?

54:22.664 --> 54:34.710
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join our chatroom, by the way, just head over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx And then, like, bomb rob with many PMs about what you'd like to fuck.

54:35.130 --> 54:36.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, tell us what you'd like to fuck.

54:37.051 --> 54:38.472
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what a fuck it is.

54:39.492 --> 54:41.813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going back to the old school schlagwerk this week, just because.

54:43.814 --> 54:45.055
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have a new song after that, by the way.

54:45.075 --> 54:45.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, cool.

54:46.356 --> 54:46.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

54:49.028 --> 54:51.830
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, my first FU of the week is Writer's Block.

54:53.591 --> 54:56.774
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, actually, this sort of links back to my old one about my hard drive.

54:57.714 --> 54:59.196
[SPEAKER_18]: For people who don't know, my hard drive died.

54:59.376 --> 55:00.376
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, completely died.

55:00.436 --> 55:00.977
[SPEAKER_18]: It broke.

55:02.404 --> 55:31.094
[SPEAKER_18]: and I lost chapter 5 actually I lost every fanfic I'd ever written but really importantly I lost the 5th chapter of the one I'm currently working on I was like 2500 words yeah 2500 words into it which for me that's you know a good bit that's actually a third of the fanfic of the chapter right there because the last few chapters I've written ended up topping over 6000 words a piece Marin's in the chat room right now and says you need to write more

55:31.872 --> 55:34.434
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'm sorry, Maren John.

55:35.074 --> 55:35.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my bad, Maren.

55:36.555 --> 55:37.475
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

55:37.775 --> 55:46.581
[SPEAKER_18]: Who, by the way, for anybody who remembers the DVR Freak moderator strip, she's my friend that I went to lunch with when we were there and hung out with.

55:47.341 --> 55:49.702
[SPEAKER_18]: She got to see me incredibly drunk at Star Trek Experience.

55:49.722 --> 55:49.983
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

55:51.543 --> 55:57.427
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I was really, really pissed off about it and didn't want to write anything for a week or so.

55:57.947 --> 55:59.148
[SPEAKER_18]: And I started writing on it again.

55:59.648 --> 56:00.389
[SPEAKER_18]: And wouldn't you know it...

56:01.784 --> 56:02.464
[SPEAKER_18]: I get started on it.

56:02.484 --> 56:03.145
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm on a roll.

56:03.725 --> 56:05.566
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan's like, hey, you want to go get food?

56:05.586 --> 56:06.226
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go get food.

56:06.246 --> 56:10.809
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went out and had some lovely French toast, and then came back, and I couldn't write.

56:11.909 --> 56:13.450
[SPEAKER_18]: I really couldn't think of anything.

56:13.510 --> 56:14.490
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, well, what the hell?

56:14.510 --> 56:17.752
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing is, I had it really dark before.

56:17.772 --> 56:19.993
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, really, like, disgustingly dark.

56:21.014 --> 56:27.197
[SPEAKER_18]: And I decided to take it a little bit lighter and do the really dark stuff on the last few chapters, and then I just blanked.

56:28.297 --> 56:29.698
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's that.

56:31.656 --> 56:32.217
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

56:32.557 --> 56:32.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

56:33.438 --> 56:38.422
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to fanfiction.net, look up DarkSakura, my fanfics there, it's a Digimon fic.

56:39.183 --> 56:39.983
[SPEAKER_18]: Like all my other ones there.

56:40.003 --> 56:41.485
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you read it, leave me reviews.

56:42.105 --> 56:43.827
[SPEAKER_18]: Reviews are special and they make me happy.

56:45.188 --> 56:47.650
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, fuck people who don't leave me reviews, because you suck.

56:48.791 --> 56:49.292
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, okay.

56:49.752 --> 56:53.355
[SPEAKER_18]: My other question of the week is, um... Okay.

56:53.496 --> 56:53.756
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

56:55.089 --> 56:58.110
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't really blame him for this, but, you know, fuck losing my cable.

56:58.370 --> 57:01.690
[SPEAKER_18]: Because even though I don't watch TV, I occasionally like the option of watching it.

57:02.391 --> 57:03.251
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can see Buffy.

57:03.391 --> 57:03.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron Chef.

57:05.471 --> 57:08.532
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we didn't even... I didn't even like watching that.

57:08.772 --> 57:11.833
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um... Well, I liked watching it when I'm with other people, but not by myself.

57:12.313 --> 57:13.933
[SPEAKER_18]: Because all it does is make me want to start cooking.

57:15.554 --> 57:21.975
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um... But what got me is that I wake up and, like... I canceled the cable!

57:22.890 --> 57:23.250
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

57:23.891 --> 57:24.732
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you don't watch it.

57:25.072 --> 57:25.993
[SPEAKER_18]: How am I going to watch Buffy?

57:26.013 --> 57:27.554
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I get crappy reception without the cable.

57:28.495 --> 57:30.997
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess I get to download episodes of Buffy.

57:31.037 --> 57:35.280
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anyone watches Buffy, take the episodes for me because I need to see James Foster's apps.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.802
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

57:37.842 --> 57:40.465
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, by the way, I'm going to go see him next month.

57:41.045 --> 57:42.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to BuffyCon?

57:42.686 --> 57:43.967
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a BuffyCon.

57:44.047 --> 57:46.790
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a sci-fi con, but I'm going to go see my man.

57:47.951 --> 57:49.152
[SPEAKER_04]: Buffy ruined the internet.

57:49.472 --> 57:49.932
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

57:50.373 --> 57:51.714
[SPEAKER_18]: No, pop-ups ruin the internet.

57:52.571 --> 57:54.513
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a list list on what ruined the internet.

57:54.533 --> 57:56.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe that should be our topic for tonight.

57:56.835 --> 57:57.135
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

57:57.175 --> 57:57.615
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do that?

57:57.855 --> 57:59.837
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to do a list list tonight, and that'll be the topic.

58:00.758 --> 58:01.859
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the internet?

58:02.059 --> 58:02.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

58:03.500 --> 58:03.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

58:04.501 --> 58:07.283
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but, uh... These things are salty.

58:07.824 --> 58:10.206
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck these pretzels, but I'll leave it to you.

58:11.266 --> 58:12.327
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's it.

58:13.809 --> 58:14.909
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, stop eating your balls.

58:16.010 --> 58:17.692
[SPEAKER_21]: I like my balls, they're big and fluffy.

58:19.813 --> 58:21.294
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to go to the next step, you.

58:22.155 --> 58:23.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's hear from you.

58:25.698 --> 58:27.639
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no saliva because these pretzels.

58:28.560 --> 58:29.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat Zalavex.

58:29.981 --> 58:31.362
[SPEAKER_06]: No French kissing for you!

58:33.404 --> 58:34.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, ugh.

58:36.072 --> 58:39.636
[SPEAKER_06]: First FU, especially with this weather, has to be stupid drivers.

58:40.537 --> 58:41.618
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers.

58:41.658 --> 58:43.539
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers that try to pull out in front of me.

58:43.559 --> 58:46.922
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers that drive 40 miles under the speed limit.

58:48.324 --> 58:48.704
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate them.

58:49.225 --> 58:49.845
[SPEAKER_06]: They're stupid.

58:50.466 --> 58:55.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially this old bitch that was behind yesterday, going down South Watt.

58:56.111 --> 58:58.213
[SPEAKER_06]: She's going 25 miles an hour, there's 20 cars behind her.

58:59.611 --> 59:06.277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, fuck you, so I went around her and everyone honked at her and flipped her off and tried to beat her off the road, but that didn't work.

59:08.399 --> 59:11.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'd up you to dial up email.

59:12.884 --> 59:19.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking A, I have my Turning Mystery thing done and I can't submit it because it's like, no, I want a timeout.

59:20.270 --> 59:20.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

59:21.791 --> 59:26.273
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can't... One way or another, my secret file is coming online tonight.

59:26.833 --> 59:30.914
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it be in the official judging for Tournament Mix 3 or on my website.

59:31.074 --> 59:32.255
[SPEAKER_06]: One way or another, it's up there.

59:33.875 --> 59:35.396
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah.

59:36.116 --> 59:36.476
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

59:36.536 --> 59:41.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have too much to go with right now because I'm happy with pretzels.

59:42.338 --> 59:45.019
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll think of something later, I'm sure.

59:45.379 --> 59:45.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

59:46.140 --> 59:46.960
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, my turn.

59:48.231 --> 59:48.571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

59:49.291 --> 59:51.272
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, F you to the rain.

59:51.712 --> 59:54.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's needed and all, but fuck, I hate driving in it.

59:54.553 --> 59:55.113
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the worst.

59:55.193 --> 59:56.833
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes everybody drive like an ass.

59:57.573 --> 59:59.954
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have this intense fear of hydroplaning.

59:59.994 --> 01:00:02.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I kick up a puddle, I think I'm going to die.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:02.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

01:00:02.855 --> 01:00:03.855
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a hydroplane.

01:00:03.895 --> 01:00:04.835
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done it before.

01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:05.375
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it sucks.

01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:05.936
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:06.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to hell.

01:00:06.316 --> 01:00:09.997
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a hydroplane, but when no one else is around, so I can do a 720 and keep going.

01:00:11.897 --> 01:00:14.299
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a scary man and I hope they never give you a license.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.723
[SPEAKER_04]: My other FU of the week goes to that stupid bitch at Walgreens who didn't know how to use her ATM card thing.

01:00:21.063 --> 01:00:21.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a hint.

01:00:22.964 --> 01:00:28.067
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know how to use your ATM card to pay for your food, you need to fucking just go get cash.

01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:29.956
[SPEAKER_04]: and do it that way.

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:33.278
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hate people that hold up the line because they're retarded.

01:00:34.779 --> 01:00:35.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life, you stupid bitch.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:36.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:36.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.

01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:38.341
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

01:00:38.581 --> 01:00:39.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have any other Refuge League.

01:00:39.742 --> 01:00:40.882
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I had other Refuge League.

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:42.964
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Christmas Carols.

01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:43.824
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get away from them.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:45.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:00:46.626 --> 01:00:47.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's my turn.

01:00:47.547 --> 01:00:47.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:50.989
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, first of all...

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.781
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, you are so cool.

01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:54.881
[SPEAKER_05]: You're playing this song.

01:00:55.382 --> 01:00:56.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up and give us your FUs.

01:00:56.482 --> 01:00:57.563
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:04.647
[SPEAKER_05]: My first FU goes to all the people who give me sympathy because my birthday is the day after Christmas.

01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:07.609
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say, oh, that sucks because you get all your presents at the same time.

01:01:07.649 --> 01:01:08.270
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.150
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:09.791
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a Jew.

01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:13.213
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but they're all like, oh, that sucks so bad because you get all your presents at the same time.

01:01:13.233 --> 01:01:14.193
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I'm Jewish.

01:01:14.313 --> 01:01:15.214
[SPEAKER_04]: This year's weird.

01:01:15.274 --> 01:01:17.155
[SPEAKER_04]: They put Hanukkah at a weird time this year.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was so early.

01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:20.430
[SPEAKER_04]: HANUKA'S LONG OVER

01:01:34.978 --> 01:01:39.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly... Oh, Christmas is just that day you don't have to go to school or you get off work randomly.

01:01:39.481 --> 01:01:41.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas is fun because it's the day before my birthday.

01:01:43.022 --> 01:01:48.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to go skiing because everyone else is going fucking eating, you know, turkey and shit.

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:49.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:01:49.766 --> 01:01:53.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my second nephew goes to my stupid, fat, fucking bitch Spanish teacher.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:54.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

01:01:55.329 --> 01:01:58.091
[SPEAKER_05]: She must weigh, like, 500 pounds.

01:01:58.591 --> 01:02:04.074
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever seen the movie Hercules, the animated one, like, she looks like the titan

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:07.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the, like, the Earth Titan or whatever?

01:02:07.415 --> 01:02:10.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's just a giant blob of mush, except the female version.

01:02:10.757 --> 01:02:12.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Her ankle is bigger than my neck.

01:02:13.218 --> 01:02:13.978
[SPEAKER_05]: I kid you not.

01:02:14.679 --> 01:02:20.802
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's so fat, and she speaks in an Italian accent for Spanish, so you can't understand a fucking word.

01:02:21.142 --> 01:02:23.803
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, okay, kiddos, remember the test today?

01:02:23.883 --> 01:02:24.463
[SPEAKER_05]: What test?

01:02:24.603 --> 01:02:24.824
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:02:24.944 --> 01:02:25.704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, project?

01:02:25.844 --> 01:02:26.084
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:27.025
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we all fail.

01:02:27.505 --> 01:02:32.867
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a D right now, and that's keeping me from doing shit that I want to do in my mom moment.

01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm done.

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:39.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's hear from the chatroom then.

01:02:41.687 --> 01:02:43.048
[SPEAKER_04]: First I'm going to open up the email bag.

01:02:43.108 --> 01:02:48.410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to open up the email bag because we have some FUs that came over email.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.251
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some late FUs from last week.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:03:01.355
[SPEAKER_04]: These come from Muheimer who sent these in last week for last week's show except he must not have been in on Saturday when we were actually taping the show.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:03.056
[SPEAKER_04]: So he sent these in on Sunday and we weren't here.

01:03:03.396 --> 01:03:04.677
[SPEAKER_04]: We were running a tape.

01:03:05.957 --> 01:03:10.338
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, as much as he enjoys hearing things that piss Jamie off the whole show, he needs to contribute his own stuff.

01:03:10.358 --> 01:03:16.140
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck non-individualistic people who are too worried what other people will think of them.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, fuck them.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my so-called friends for not going to the movies with me because it was a whole ten minutes out of the way.

01:03:21.942 --> 01:03:23.282
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a DDR machine there, yay.

01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:27.703
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to go with only two people instead of who I wanted to go with.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:34.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that DDR machine at the movies because it didn't have a good screen quality and it made me look suckier than I really am, which is pretty sucky anyway.

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:38.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Pierce Brosnan for getting to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry instead of me.

01:03:40.565 --> 01:03:45.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget that Billy Bob Thornton also got to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry in that movie, and she was all topless and stuff, too.

01:03:46.008 --> 01:03:46.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster's Ball.

01:03:47.148 --> 01:03:49.349
[SPEAKER_04]: That movie's fucked up, though.

01:03:49.669 --> 01:03:53.691
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen a movie that made me want to kill myself, but Monster's Ball just makes you want to die.

01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:55.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't rent it, it's awful.

01:03:58.604 --> 01:04:05.988
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't rent the whole movie.

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:08.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she show her titties?

01:04:08.649 --> 01:04:11.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she show her titties to Die Another Day or something?

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:13.011
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think so.

01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:14.191
[SPEAKER_05]: In Monster's Ball.

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:14.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I knew that.

01:04:15.872 --> 01:04:19.534
[SPEAKER_18]: I just found a picture of my man and I'm staring at him and ignoring the naked Halle's ball.

01:04:20.214 --> 01:04:20.494
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

01:04:20.554 --> 01:04:21.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Women are pigs.

01:04:21.675 --> 01:04:22.595
[SPEAKER_18]: Women are pigs.

01:04:22.655 --> 01:04:24.636
[SPEAKER_09]: All you do is sit there and oogle Alan Rickman.

01:04:24.696 --> 01:04:25.677
[SPEAKER_18]: Play my fucking music.

01:04:27.287 --> 01:04:30.611
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to Halle Berry for ruining the character of Storm in X-Men.

01:04:30.671 --> 01:04:31.071
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

01:04:32.593 --> 01:04:34.696
[SPEAKER_18]: She fucked up the accent and fucked up the whole movie.

01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:36.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying Halle Berry ruined the internet?

01:04:36.878 --> 01:04:38.440
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm saying she ruined X-Men.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.243
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, the trailer is out for X2.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.108
[SPEAKER_18]: It's looking to be good, but the bitch is still in it.

01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:47.010
[SPEAKER_18]: So fuck her for existing.

01:04:47.944 --> 01:04:50.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there snowboarders or extreme sports in that movie?

01:04:51.466 --> 01:04:54.448
[SPEAKER_06]: A third one, they can just call it Triple X. Whoa.

01:04:56.149 --> 01:04:59.090
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very disappointed that that movie has no porn in it whatsoever.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.291
[SPEAKER_06]: What a misleading title.

01:05:00.371 --> 01:05:04.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Triple X, you'd expect booby shot, something like that, but no.

01:05:07.853 --> 01:05:15.758
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's Matt Hoffman or... But whatever that one was, that one was better than Triple X. I mean, fuck Propel.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Propel just spit up in my face.

01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:22.482
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called BMXXX, and I got a copy for free on Xbox.

01:05:23.743 --> 01:05:24.483
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Dan did.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, thanks.

01:05:30.019 --> 01:05:31.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you what ruined X-Men.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you right here what ruined X-Men.

01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:37.002
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, here, this is what ruined X-Men.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:40.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?

01:05:41.683 --> 01:05:43.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing that happens to everything else.

01:05:44.364 --> 01:05:45.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, he sucks.

01:05:45.565 --> 01:05:47.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Who let that get in the script?

01:05:47.926 --> 01:05:50.627
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:52.188
[SPEAKER_18]: Delivered by the stupidest person.

01:05:52.408 --> 01:05:52.948
[SPEAKER_18]: God!

01:05:53.468 --> 01:05:57.350
[SPEAKER_05]: It was for all the eight-year-old little kids who watch the little TV show.

01:05:57.751 --> 01:06:01.312
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they can go and, like, go repeat that line over and over again.

01:06:01.513 --> 01:06:02.433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fuck kids!

01:06:02.633 --> 01:06:05.595
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be like, no, what happens when lightning hits the toe?

01:06:05.815 --> 01:06:07.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, I don't know.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:08.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounded cool, though.

01:06:10.658 --> 01:06:11.758
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was dumb.

01:06:11.778 --> 01:06:12.539
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of neat.

01:06:12.759 --> 01:06:13.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:14.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, we still have fuck yous.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:18.082
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have Mooheimers this week's fuck yous.

01:06:19.562 --> 01:06:22.226
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my swim coaches for being lazy and dumb and whatnot.

01:06:22.606 --> 01:06:26.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck lame projects and fuck the crazy DDR machine that poor Loki couldn't hack.

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:27.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Loki.

01:06:27.573 --> 01:06:30.397
[SPEAKER_04]: And he spells Loki L-O-K-I-E, which I think is really cute.

01:06:32.063 --> 01:06:36.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I demand that we start calling you Loki.

01:06:36.786 --> 01:06:38.707
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some more stuff out of there.

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:45.691
[SPEAKER_06]: I got all the samples, including the... What's kind of funny is they actually have all the sound samples from all the mixes on the machine.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:46.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

01:06:47.272 --> 01:06:47.832
[SPEAKER_06]: From all the mixes.

01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:50.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the DDR second mix battle samples.

01:06:51.054 --> 01:06:51.614
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I want those.

01:06:51.654 --> 01:06:52.535
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got all those.

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:53.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:06:53.335 --> 01:06:54.976
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like the old announcer and everything?

01:06:55.524 --> 01:06:57.845
[SPEAKER_06]: All the old announcers from first all the way up to max two.

01:06:57.865 --> 01:06:58.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Tin Can Lady?

01:06:59.085 --> 01:07:03.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, no solo stuff, because I say solo is its own breed, but it's, um... Dude, I want those.

01:07:04.426 --> 01:07:05.486
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got all the samples for that.

01:07:05.506 --> 01:07:05.706
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:07.527
[SPEAKER_18]: My AOL theme is going to be all DDR.

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:10.668
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I still have AOL.

01:07:10.728 --> 01:07:11.828
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck AOL, by the way.

01:07:12.968 --> 01:07:14.348
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, fuck this one, AOL.

01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:15.089
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's my music?

01:07:17.532 --> 01:07:25.379
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, fuck AOL, because, alright, I'm using 8.0, and I have this neat little Slytherin background, and the logo, the actual Slytherin logo is gone.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:26.440
[SPEAKER_18]: My background's just grey.

01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:27.801
[SPEAKER_18]: So fuck AOL.

01:07:29.342 --> 01:07:30.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish with the chatroom now?

01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:30.804
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

01:07:31.304 --> 01:07:31.604
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:35.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Wackwab!

01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:39.050
[SPEAKER_04]: says, oh my god, he's got a lot here.

01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:42.631
[SPEAKER_04]: FU, fuck finals, I hate finals.

01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:47.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the rain for starting on Friday instead of Saturday because I had to ride my bike in the rain to both my finals on Friday.

01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:52.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the owner of Tap Express for not unlocking the Max 2 machine after it was installed.

01:07:52.295 --> 01:07:53.235
[SPEAKER_04]: God knows why he didn't do it.

01:07:53.756 --> 01:07:55.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the 49ers for not winning today.

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:56.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck allergies.

01:07:56.497 --> 01:07:57.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fuck them.

01:07:57.317 --> 01:08:00.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed all my classes this week before finals because I was sick.

01:08:00.678 --> 01:08:01.679
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck Hugh Grant.

01:08:02.099 --> 01:08:05.520
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to die so I can move up one rung on my girlfriend's ladder of love.

01:08:08.103 --> 01:08:10.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, why aren't you number one on your girlfriend's ladder of love?

01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:13.126
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fucked up right there.

01:08:13.767 --> 01:08:14.467
[SPEAKER_15]: He's hot.

01:08:15.468 --> 01:08:17.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there a ladder that you need to move up rungs on?

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:20.671
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're not one... You need a promotion?

01:08:21.191 --> 01:08:24.453
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not one, then you should at least be number two or three, I'm thinking.

01:08:25.114 --> 01:08:27.815
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you sound like you're number 18 or 19 right now.

01:08:30.999 --> 01:08:31.299
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:38.328
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get our butt kicked by Black Lab in about five seconds as soon as the buffer gets to them.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.068
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.812
[SPEAKER_18]: I have another actress I'd like to say fuck you to.

01:08:42.593 --> 01:08:42.993
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

01:08:43.634 --> 01:08:44.294
[SPEAKER_18]: Linda Fiorentino.

01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:50.130
[SPEAKER_04]: That part was written for Alanis.

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:51.771
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alanis declined it.

01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:54.352
[SPEAKER_04]: But then came back and said, no, I guess I'll be in the movie.

01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:57.655
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kevin Smith said, oh, well, I have a better part for you anyway.

01:08:57.855 --> 01:08:58.675
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why she's gone.

01:08:58.695 --> 01:09:01.077
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you think Garofalo should have had it?

01:09:01.197 --> 01:09:02.218
[SPEAKER_18]: Who, God?

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:02.658
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:09:02.678 --> 01:09:03.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would have been cool.

01:09:03.478 --> 01:09:04.479
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Garofalo should have had it.

01:09:04.499 --> 01:09:05.320
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that would have been cool.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.421
[SPEAKER_18]: And they actually went back and said they should have given it to her.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:10.883
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, Linda Fiorentino.

01:09:10.903 --> 01:09:12.544
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep going with Chet Room.

01:09:12.604 --> 01:09:12.885
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, yes.

01:09:12.905 --> 01:09:13.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Chet Room.

01:09:13.525 --> 01:09:14.686
[SPEAKER_18]: They can use my music if they want to.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:16.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to Twin.

01:09:17.965 --> 01:09:19.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck us for dissing Feet of Fury.

01:09:20.566 --> 01:09:21.626
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck the ferret.

01:09:21.646 --> 01:09:22.686
[SPEAKER_15]: Feet of Fury sucks.

01:09:23.266 --> 01:09:24.467
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck a tree.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.087
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck anything here.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck not owning an ignition pad.

01:09:29.007 --> 01:09:30.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck not playing his promo.

01:09:31.028 --> 01:09:32.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Christmas for being too far away.

01:09:33.768 --> 01:09:37.609
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck Twin for ruining the internet and MIRC.

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:38.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.

01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.849
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

01:09:38.969 --> 01:09:43.050
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would like to point out that Halle Berry's tits are shown for 10 seconds in Swordfish.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:46.132
[SPEAKER_04]: And what glorious ten seconds they were.

01:09:47.293 --> 01:09:48.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, only like three and a half.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:49.654
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is for people who can't get laid.

01:09:50.015 --> 01:09:52.516
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, only like four or five.

01:09:52.997 --> 01:09:53.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe six.

01:09:54.297 --> 01:09:54.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

01:09:55.819 --> 01:09:57.580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I'm reading a book.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, I don't have clothes on.

01:09:59.941 --> 01:10:03.944
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of like, what's her name in the Thomas Crown Affair?

01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:08.988
[SPEAKER_04]: She's kind of an older lady, but she's still, you know, considering her age, she still has some very nice looking titties.

01:10:09.895 --> 01:10:11.677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that old chick in the beach.

01:10:13.038 --> 01:10:15.740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch Leonardo DiCaprio movies.

01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:18.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

01:10:19.102 --> 01:10:19.843
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Propel.

01:10:20.263 --> 01:10:20.764
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tasty.

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:28.630
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks says, fuck you to Owen and Mike for both cancelling on me this weekend, resulting in shit getting done on SoCalKicks.

01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:31.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait, isn't that a good thing if you get work done?

01:10:32.393 --> 01:10:33.734
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he meant like jack shit.

01:10:33.754 --> 01:10:34.735
[SPEAKER_04]: You confused me, sir.

01:10:34.915 --> 01:10:36.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, resulting in jack shit?

01:10:36.076 --> 01:10:37.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he said resulting in shit.

01:10:39.063 --> 01:10:40.444
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me that in the negative fashion.

01:10:40.504 --> 01:10:41.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll see.

01:10:41.064 --> 01:10:42.945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we will get a clarification.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:45.186
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave's head's on the floor and I can totally kick him in the head now.

01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:45.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

01:10:45.967 --> 01:10:47.588
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB says, F you to the rain.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:52.410
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wants me to hold off playing some originals towards the end of the show.

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

01:10:54.391 --> 01:10:56.113
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, to your last thing, the answer is no.

01:11:16.963 --> 01:11:17.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just no, but hell no.

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:19.265
[SPEAKER_04]: When you decide, let me know and I'll still tell you no.

01:11:19.285 --> 01:11:19.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, here!

01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:47.834
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen her in the chat room in a long time.

01:11:47.874 --> 01:11:51.876
[SPEAKER_06]: She's always idling and then somehow gets disconnected.

01:11:52.056 --> 01:11:56.718
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that they tried to contact you multiple times after you've broken up, asking to get back together with you.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:07.323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just laughing because Black Lab's telling off Twen in the chat room, going, please, go get laid, please.

01:12:09.664 --> 01:12:09.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Again?

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:12.585
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a daily occurrence.

01:12:12.885 --> 01:12:13.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:12:15.246 --> 01:12:17.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, Stresa says it's okay.

01:12:17.826 --> 01:12:20.247
[SPEAKER_04]: He cries and you laughing is cool.

01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:21.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I have another F you.

01:12:22.187 --> 01:12:22.988
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remembered now.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.628
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just think that Dan would kick his ass.

01:12:26.568 --> 01:12:27.969
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an F you to my camera.

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.229
[SPEAKER_06]: The camera I just bought.

01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:32.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all the pictures it takes are way too dark.

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.910
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even have time to change the music.

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:38.611
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should give you a flashlight to carry around with it.

01:12:39.116 --> 01:12:39.617
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

01:12:39.657 --> 01:12:41.980
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have the sun behind you and it wouldn't matter.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I still got a million FUs to get through here.

01:12:44.703 --> 01:12:47.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Brack2000 says, FlashFlash... Oh, whoops.

01:12:47.607 --> 01:12:50.210
[SPEAKER_04]: That was another FU for... That was a hint for earlier in the show.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:53.514
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to EOSFVB for making him hear the catch-up song.

01:12:53.594 --> 01:12:53.975
[SPEAKER_04]: And he cried.

01:12:56.315 --> 01:12:57.896
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought my ears were going to bleed.

01:12:57.996 --> 01:13:03.580
[SPEAKER_04]: The background song, by the way, is Cheer Train from 2DX7Style, for those that were inquiring.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.403
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus says, F you to Skrull for delaying his work on his Tournament Mix entry.

01:13:08.904 --> 01:13:09.924
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good one, too.

01:13:10.044 --> 01:13:11.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Invasion of the Gabba Robots.

01:13:11.505 --> 01:13:12.086
[SPEAKER_04]: All your base.

01:13:12.686 --> 01:13:13.707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that would have been beautiful.

01:13:14.107 --> 01:13:16.168
[SPEAKER_06]: I should put a page on my website.

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:22.072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Tournament Mix 3 entries that would have been in there, but we got lazy and didn't finish it in time.

01:13:22.092 --> 01:13:23.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I could put mine in there, too.

01:13:23.894 --> 01:13:25.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I never finish mine, either.

01:13:26.916 --> 01:13:31.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, I also have an FU to my menu script for not working with Mozilla, which is the browser of the gods.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, here.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Skrull and fuck bad Javascripts.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:38.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Mother Nature, you do not make me walk home four blocks in horizontal rain, bitch.

01:13:41.391 --> 01:13:47.695
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB says, fuck you to Dave, he didn't get anything for the Mystical Rob Epic Quest, so he at least deserves an FU.

01:13:48.435 --> 01:13:48.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what?

01:13:50.516 --> 01:13:51.497
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what they're talking about.

01:13:51.517 --> 01:13:53.578
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.819
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you talking about?

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:06.566
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, fuck you to Bobby Flay for crying like a bitch to get his rematch against Morimoto and then winning a couple years ago.

01:14:06.586 --> 01:14:08.727
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was such bullshit.

01:14:09.067 --> 01:14:10.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he got up, he like,

01:14:11.124 --> 01:14:13.264
[SPEAKER_05]: He stood up on his little chopping board.

01:14:13.284 --> 01:14:15.145
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, I'm gonna win.

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:16.365
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he got his ass beat.

01:14:16.725 --> 01:14:17.826
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he all came back.

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:20.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Morimoto's like, no, he doesn't deserve to win.

01:14:20.846 --> 01:14:24.227
[SPEAKER_05]: He disgraces himself as a chef because he stands on his equipment.

01:14:24.267 --> 01:14:25.047
[SPEAKER_05]: He can still do that.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.527
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he gets back later.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:27.468
[SPEAKER_05]: They go to Japan.

01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:30.908
[SPEAKER_05]: And he takes off the chopping board.

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:31.989
[SPEAKER_05]: And he puts it aside.

01:14:32.029 --> 01:14:33.249
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he stands on the table.

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:36.230
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, okay, you're still a jackass.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.630
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just an idiot.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.813
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I don't know, they said that he won, but that was such bullshit.

01:14:41.013 --> 01:14:42.795
[SPEAKER_05]: They must have rigged some shit.

01:14:43.696 --> 01:14:45.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Morimoto is the king.

01:14:45.758 --> 01:14:46.198
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

01:14:46.278 --> 01:14:47.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, EOSFVB clarified here.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:57.329
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying, when I left somewhere, and I brought back stuff for everybody except for Dave, that means you deserve an FU, because you must have done something to not get anything.

01:14:57.349 --> 01:15:02.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... No...

01:15:04.762 --> 01:15:06.424
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to finish.

01:15:06.664 --> 01:15:06.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:15:07.565 --> 01:15:09.687
[SPEAKER_04]: This segment always runs way too long, but oh well.

01:15:10.028 --> 01:15:11.049
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just angsty.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:14.472
[SPEAKER_04]: The DDR community and Bomani community in general is just angsty little people.

01:15:16.735 --> 01:15:23.642
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Starbucks on Broadway for being so slow, says SkylineDC505, and it said it made them late to zero period.

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:25.864
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll teach you to go to Starbucks.

01:15:29.496 --> 01:15:33.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Midpower says, F you to Sleep, because his sleeping schedule is all screwed up.

01:15:33.579 --> 01:15:37.782
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to his floppy drive, since he has to run in safe mode whenever he wants to put a file on a floppy disk.

01:15:38.723 --> 01:15:48.229
[SPEAKER_04]: And also F you to Hugh Grant, because the pig... Oh, I'm sorry, I thought he said Hugh Grant, but he's just saying F you to Hugh, the pig in his Animal Crossing game.

01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he magically changed his roof color to yellow.

01:15:52.254 --> 01:15:54.997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been red since he started his game and now it's fucking yellow.

01:15:55.658 --> 01:16:01.344
[SPEAKER_04]: And also an FU to EOSFVB since he said an FU to VidPower last week when VidPower wasn't here.

01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:01.705
[SPEAKER_04]: So ha!

01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:07.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had two people paint my roof in my town.

01:16:07.835 --> 01:16:08.876
[SPEAKER_04]: That pissed me the fuck off.

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:10.857
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, they painted mine Pepto-Bismol pink.

01:16:11.178 --> 01:16:11.258
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

01:16:11.278 --> 01:16:11.778
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Ed.

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:14.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Olivia painted mine like baby boy blue.

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:14.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.201
[SPEAKER_18]: Send Olivia back to my village.

01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:16.981
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take her.

01:16:17.262 --> 01:16:19.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Put her in a big burlap bag and take her back.

01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:21.064
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want her back.

01:16:21.164 --> 01:16:22.325
[SPEAKER_18]: We got our lesbian back, though.

01:16:22.725 --> 01:16:23.186
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

01:16:23.226 --> 01:16:23.786
[SPEAKER_18]: We got Dina.

01:16:24.407 --> 01:16:25.569
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, back to the fuckies.

01:16:25.969 --> 01:16:26.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, back to the fuckies.

01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:30.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Muhimer says, oh, he would like to apologize.

01:16:30.875 --> 01:16:35.301
[SPEAKER_04]: With the whole Loki thing, he figured out Loki was just L-O-K-I instead of L-O-K-I-E.

01:16:35.681 --> 01:16:36.602
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like two hours ago.

01:16:36.622 --> 01:16:37.363
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, what the fuck?

01:16:37.383 --> 01:16:38.064
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, sorry.

01:16:38.585 --> 01:16:40.647
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we all get paid for this little show?

01:16:41.528 --> 01:16:46.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good... Oh, God, my side hurts.

01:16:46.111 --> 01:16:46.511
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good.

01:16:46.831 --> 01:16:47.291
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't.

01:16:48.092 --> 01:16:49.232
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we pay to do it.

01:16:49.372 --> 01:16:50.293
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sad part.

01:16:50.613 --> 01:16:51.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Send your checks.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:55.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you want to pay us.

01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:57.477
[SPEAKER_18]: Send it, you know, to me.

01:16:57.817 --> 01:17:02.219
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the best way you could pay us is to whore this station out to all your friends and listen all the time.

01:17:02.459 --> 01:17:03.540
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to break our limit.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we need to break our limit.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.901
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to get... Is that a limit breaker?

01:17:08.922 --> 01:17:09.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is loose.

01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:12.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

01:17:12.443 --> 01:17:16.484
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering... They said we should set up a PayPal account.

01:17:16.504 --> 01:17:19.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't do that because we don't think people would actually donate to that.

01:17:19.065 --> 01:17:24.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to pay me, it would be NightmareHunter at Yahoo.com.

01:17:24.187 --> 01:17:27.588
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PayPal account set up to send money, and I'll be appreciative.

01:17:27.608 --> 01:17:30.089
[SPEAKER_04]: That was immediately followed by PayPal ruined the internet.

01:17:32.006 --> 01:17:34.268
[SPEAKER_18]: PayPal ruined my bank account when I had PayPal.

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:39.691
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we were like, oh, let's buy Neo Geo cartridges at $300 a piece.

01:17:40.091 --> 01:17:41.052
[SPEAKER_18]: We can pay with PayPal.

01:17:41.112 --> 01:17:42.352
[SPEAKER_18]: It's easy and convenient.

01:17:43.853 --> 01:17:46.475
[SPEAKER_18]: However, it did facilitate me getting Mega Man X4 on Saturn.

01:17:46.615 --> 01:17:47.816
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Rockman X4.

01:17:49.035 --> 01:17:50.735
[SPEAKER_04]: Best way you could show us some lovin'.

01:17:51.576 --> 01:17:53.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Get all your friends to listen to the station.

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:54.356
[SPEAKER_18]: And take us out for dinner.

01:17:54.476 --> 01:17:55.117
[SPEAKER_04]: And take us out for dinner.

01:17:55.577 --> 01:18:05.799
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if you want to go to live365.com and play around on their website, what you can do, you can set Orange Lounge Radio to your very favorite radio station.

01:18:06.259 --> 01:18:10.160
[SPEAKER_04]: And if enough people do that, then we start getting discounts from Live365.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:16.822
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to kind of inadvertently give us money without giving us money, go set Orange Lounge Radio as your favorite station on Live365.

01:18:16.862 --> 01:18:18.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go into your presets.

01:18:18.482 --> 01:18:23.510
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to add Orange Lounge Radio as a preset and then you're going to say which one of your presets do you want to make your favorite station.

01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:26.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Select Orange Lounge Radio and we're all happy campers.

01:18:27.516 --> 01:18:28.718
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also do appearances.

01:18:28.858 --> 01:18:31.683
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't charge that much by hour, so look me up.

01:18:33.982 --> 01:18:41.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's great if Orange Lounge Radio is already in your presets, but if you want to make it your favorite preset, that's even better.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:42.745
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love you lots for that.

01:18:42.765 --> 01:18:43.145
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helps us.

01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:43.965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:45.125
[SPEAKER_04]: Helps us pay bills.

01:18:45.506 --> 01:18:52.988
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't need to do that because I just have a link or a shortcut to my desktop, so I don't even need to go on there.

01:18:53.949 --> 01:18:57.033
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized that most people don't do that.

01:18:57.373 --> 01:18:58.134
[SPEAKER_04]: But do it anyway.

01:18:58.174 --> 01:18:59.536
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make us happy, do it anyway.

01:18:59.576 --> 01:19:00.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the website for once.

01:19:02.199 --> 01:19:03.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a free account.

01:19:04.502 --> 01:19:07.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a fake email address or whatever so all the spam goes there.

01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:08.447
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

01:19:09.768 --> 01:19:12.872
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, tell them that you love Orange Lounge Radio more than anything.

01:19:13.913 --> 01:19:14.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:19:14.534 --> 01:19:19.560
[SPEAKER_18]: It sucks having a screen name for like eight years because I get so much junk mail on it now.

01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:23.025
[SPEAKER_18]: On my DarkSakura thing.

01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:23.846
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way... Yes?

01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:24.046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

01:19:25.413 --> 01:19:31.655
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I have to say something that I'm going to actually retract one of my old FUs.

01:19:32.216 --> 01:19:32.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

01:19:33.196 --> 01:19:33.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

01:19:33.796 --> 01:19:35.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is going to retract an old FU, so what do I do?

01:19:35.977 --> 01:19:37.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I play Sligwork backwards?

01:19:37.538 --> 01:19:38.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I play a happy song?

01:19:38.518 --> 01:19:39.158
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I play?

01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:39.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:19:41.239 --> 01:19:45.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Another FU to Pepsi and pretzels because I feel like I'm going to explode.

01:19:46.283 --> 01:19:47.263
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, cool, do it.

01:19:48.604 --> 01:19:50.504
[SPEAKER_18]: No, play something happy.

01:19:50.644 --> 01:19:51.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Play something happy.

01:19:52.025 --> 01:19:54.345
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the Changma song.

01:19:55.286 --> 01:19:56.106
[SPEAKER_04]: The Changma song?

01:19:56.246 --> 01:19:56.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:59.927
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, I don't think I have Changma queued up.

01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:00.427
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:20:02.328 --> 01:20:05.489
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we can play... We're playing old.

01:20:05.989 --> 01:20:06.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Old?

01:20:06.349 --> 01:20:06.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys?

01:20:07.209 --> 01:20:07.589
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:20:07.609 --> 01:20:08.210
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom Boom Dollar?

01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:09.470
[SPEAKER_04]: My Fire?

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:10.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad Girls?

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Get Down.

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:11.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Get Down.

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is a happy song.

01:20:12.371 --> 01:20:12.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:41.808
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm retracting my FU about the people who send me instant messages because now I couldn't hop on my DJ Celica I'm going to go ahead and say it I have a username now I'm not going to give the full one out but it's primarily DJ Celica that's one of my AIM names that is not the full AIM name by the way because I'm not going to say the whole thing on the air I would sign on that and get no less than 17 IMs in one sitting

01:20:42.828 --> 01:20:45.309
[SPEAKER_18]: You should have seen it during the time that Shaft was going on.

01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:49.852
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I counted it during my first five minutes of being online without an away message.

01:20:50.292 --> 01:20:51.252
[SPEAKER_18]: I had 30 IMs.

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:51.252
30.

01:20:53.113 --> 01:20:54.714
[SPEAKER_18]: 13.

01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:54.714
[SPEAKER_18]: I counted them.

01:20:54.794 --> 01:20:55.514
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so popular.

01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:02.458
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm actually happy to say that I was on my name for a little while yesterday.

01:21:03.018 --> 01:21:05.579
[SPEAKER_18]: I had the thing on for 10 minutes without an away message.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.841
[SPEAKER_18]: And I didn't get a single message.

01:21:07.881 --> 01:21:08.681
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you.

01:21:09.862 --> 01:21:10.322
[SPEAKER_18]: However...

01:21:11.511 --> 01:21:15.538
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my other, my AOL name that used to go on all the time.

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.080
[SPEAKER_18]: That one's gotten better.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.828
[SPEAKER_18]: There's people who are not randomly IMing me when I haven't given them the permission to IM me.

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:47.342
[SPEAKER_18]: and although I have to say I took one of my names off of hiding and lo and behold even after 8 years I'm still getting like 20 million messages on that name so I put it back on hiding so I'm going to go and be more specific with who I see that way and the people by the way who I don't mind messaging me you know who you are and I never care

01:21:48.346 --> 01:21:54.248
[SPEAKER_18]: But for all those random people who, like, I barely know or maybe see, like, you know, once.

01:21:54.488 --> 01:21:56.409
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen you at, like, a tournament or something.

01:21:56.949 --> 01:22:00.670
[SPEAKER_18]: Or I haven't known you for longer than at least two years, you know.

01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:05.672
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, give me a few minutes to sit on line and just be here for a while.

01:22:06.352 --> 01:22:09.853
[SPEAKER_18]: Before you decide, oh my god, I have to talk to Jamie right now!

01:22:11.374 --> 01:22:12.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless your house is burning.

01:22:12.814 --> 01:22:14.695
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless your house is burning and then call a fire department.

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:18.511
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your fire department.

01:22:19.032 --> 01:22:20.756
[SPEAKER_18]: I ain't your fire department, I'm sorry.

01:22:23.342 --> 01:22:23.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:32.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I accept IMs, but unfortunately I'm... Well, anyways, my AOL Instant Messenger thing is SacramentoLoki0.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.957
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you happen to be on there, go ahead and IM me.

01:22:37.277 --> 01:22:38.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, I'm never on there.

01:22:38.357 --> 01:22:40.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, that's what I do.

01:22:40.058 --> 01:22:41.459
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't use Instant Messenger.

01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:45.801
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of things online, though, I actually, if we're done with RFUs of the week... Yeah.

01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:47.582
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I actually have an announcement.

01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:49.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Announcement, announcement, announcement.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:50.444
[SPEAKER_02]: I made this announcement.

01:22:50.464 --> 01:22:53.265
[SPEAKER_02]: A horrible way to die, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die.

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:55.955
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, I'm going to hit you with a ferret.

01:22:57.215 --> 01:22:57.335
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow!

01:23:00.257 --> 01:23:00.557
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

01:23:01.618 --> 01:23:05.280
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a pretzel.

01:23:07.401 --> 01:23:08.301
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a pretzel smush, haha.

01:23:08.662 --> 01:23:17.947
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, this announcement, I don't know if anyone remembers me mentioning the thing based off a radio drama based off of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

01:23:19.648 --> 01:23:21.671
[SPEAKER_18]: There's one position left open.

01:23:21.711 --> 01:23:24.774
[SPEAKER_18]: We need your audition reel.

01:23:25.895 --> 01:23:32.523
[SPEAKER_18]: So the position left open, if I remember correctly, is the drunken zombie date.

01:23:33.684 --> 01:23:34.585
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura at AOL.com

01:23:54.148 --> 01:23:58.751
[SPEAKER_18]: That which is, by the way, the name that's hidden from anybody ever knowing that I'm online.

01:23:59.191 --> 01:23:59.752
[SPEAKER_18]: So go ahead.

01:24:00.072 --> 01:24:02.233
[SPEAKER_18]: You can buddy list that all you want to because you'll never see it.

01:24:03.734 --> 01:24:11.359
[SPEAKER_18]: But go ahead and email me your voice acting reel, your audition to DarkSakura at AOL.com.

01:24:11.559 --> 01:24:12.519
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of voice would that be?

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a whiny goth boy voice?

01:24:14.481 --> 01:24:15.601
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunken zombie date.

01:24:15.701 --> 01:24:16.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken zombie date.

01:24:16.462 --> 01:24:16.882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's drunk.

01:24:16.902 --> 01:24:17.142
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:17.423
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:19.784
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be a drunken zombie.

01:24:21.705 --> 01:24:22.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:22.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:24.793
[SPEAKER_18]: And where's your audition reel?

01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:25.653
[SPEAKER_18]: You said you were interested.

01:24:25.673 --> 01:24:27.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, I got lazy.

01:24:31.174 --> 01:24:33.255
[SPEAKER_18]: Just send them to me.

01:24:33.555 --> 01:24:40.956
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're hoping to get underway with the recording soon, and it will be broadcast on this very radio station once we get a first episode out.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.837
[SPEAKER_04]: And give that email address out one more time.

01:24:44.217 --> 01:24:46.817
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura at ALL.com Beautiful.

01:24:47.237 --> 01:24:50.338
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is funny, because I had that name before there was a Dark Sakura.

01:24:51.358 --> 01:24:51.518
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

01:24:52.148 --> 01:24:53.489
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura

01:25:18.518 --> 01:25:19.480
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's because I'm neat.

01:25:19.701 --> 01:25:24.192
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the whole history of why I have that name now, but send me auditions.

01:25:25.069 --> 01:25:30.651
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and do the cage match for this week.

01:25:30.671 --> 01:25:31.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

01:25:31.071 --> 01:25:33.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we didn't do a cage match last week, so we're going to do tonight's cage match.

01:25:34.372 --> 01:25:36.753
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do some more fun stuff.

01:25:36.773 --> 01:25:41.195
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a list list to get to at some point tonight, so we'll do all that in a little bit.

01:25:41.215 --> 01:25:44.396
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a short break, because we're going to be doing more music during the cage match.

01:25:45.156 --> 01:25:48.057
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just want to get up and stretch and pee.

01:25:48.217 --> 01:25:48.798
[SPEAKER_04]: And eat pretzels.

01:25:49.058 --> 01:25:49.598
[SPEAKER_04]: And eat pretzels.

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:51.419
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be back.

01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:51.959
[SPEAKER_04]: See you.

01:25:52.079 --> 01:25:52.559

DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:27:35.770 --> 01:28:03.947
[SPEAKER_09]: He knew that his heart was feeling He'd been hurt too much to try again But when she caught his eye Ain't no man could fight the feeling He knew he had to try to let go of it Mother let him know She was in the mood for talking So when he began to play the game Before he knew it He had told her how much he'd been hurting How he was hoping she was not the same Would you see the kinds of ladies that are

01:28:10.687 --> 01:28:15.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't have to look no more, I'll give the love you need, Do you holler enough?

01:28:15.449 --> 01:28:16.390

01:28:31.356 --> 01:28:33.317
I am the cure, And when you wake up late,

01:31:38.035 --> 01:31:39.856
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you think this is the end?

01:31:40.776 --> 01:31:42.296
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not the end.

01:31:42.537 --> 01:31:44.677
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the beginning of your next journey.

01:31:45.077 --> 01:31:49.199
[SPEAKER_11]: The Good Pool Journey Part 2.

01:31:59.202 --> 01:32:02.503
[SPEAKER_22]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

01:32:03.023 --> 01:32:03.804
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:07.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave's doing the dance.

01:32:10.345 --> 01:32:11.226
[SPEAKER_17]: Dave is doing the dance.

01:32:11.246 --> 01:32:13.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I've got to play that one more time just so Dave can do the dance.

01:32:15.872 --> 01:32:18.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go, here we go.

01:32:19.376 --> 01:32:22.640
[SPEAKER_22]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.762
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:26.116 --> 01:32:28.819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best part, because that looks like Ricky Martin right there.

01:32:28.839 --> 01:32:32.983
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like he's doing the Latino pata pata.

01:32:34.404 --> 01:32:38.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, even though you can't see it, I'm just going to do it anyway, so screw you.

01:32:38.969 --> 01:32:40.110
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even see what I'm doing.

01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:41.431

01:32:41.512 --> 01:32:43.313
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFBB, Spider-Man does the dance.

01:32:43.934 --> 01:32:47.257
[SPEAKER_18]: That looks stupid, though.

01:32:47.397 --> 01:32:49.600
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, all the girls go like this.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:54.882
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty much good in C. He just shook his hips in rhythm.

01:32:55.762 --> 01:32:57.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki's having problems here.

01:32:57.743 --> 01:32:58.163
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

01:32:58.723 --> 01:33:00.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's flipping off my roommate's computer.

01:33:00.643 --> 01:33:01.444
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your problem?

01:33:03.084 --> 01:33:03.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Net zero.

01:33:03.925 --> 01:33:05.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to submit it for you?

01:33:05.725 --> 01:33:06.885
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, Jamie's going to do it.

01:33:06.946 --> 01:33:09.166
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to submit Loki.

01:33:09.246 --> 01:33:09.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just burped.

01:33:10.087 --> 01:33:10.627
[SPEAKER_04]: That was gross.

01:33:10.947 --> 01:33:11.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Burp.

01:33:11.747 --> 01:33:14.209
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to submit Loki's Tourney Mix 3 entry right now.

01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:19.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Continue to FU to net zero because they suck ass and their servers are slow as ass.

01:33:20.654 --> 01:33:22.616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use ass as an adjective for now.

01:33:24.741 --> 01:33:25.262
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

01:33:25.542 --> 01:33:26.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's having issues.

01:33:26.823 --> 01:33:27.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:33:28.545 --> 01:33:33.951
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose this is the portion of the show where we should get into another little thing that we do here every week.

01:33:34.892 --> 01:33:37.835
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is... Let me clear my throat.

01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:40.978
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

01:33:41.018 --> 01:33:41.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody...

01:33:42.672 --> 01:33:49.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week in the cage match, actually two weeks ago, we didn't do it last week, because we did a pre-tape show.

01:33:50.655 --> 01:33:57.218
[SPEAKER_04]: So last week's winner of the cage match, a couple weeks ago, was... I'm trying to find it, I can't find it.

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.339
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Knight Rider theme.

01:34:00.579 --> 01:34:01.900
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the chair, it's so beautiful

01:34:46.587 --> 01:34:48.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

01:35:02.338 --> 01:35:04.959
[SPEAKER_04]: The Knight Rider theme, done all, redone.

01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:05.900
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more F you.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dave.

01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:08.701
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little late.

01:35:09.262 --> 01:35:09.902
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

01:35:10.282 --> 01:35:10.942
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about it.

01:35:11.062 --> 01:35:13.464
[SPEAKER_05]: I had thought about it, like, on Wednesday.

01:35:13.484 --> 01:35:15.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, damn, I need to, okay.

01:35:16.125 --> 01:35:17.846
[SPEAKER_05]: I got kicked out of Jamie's chair.

01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:20.112
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically, it's Brian's chair, but I claim it.

01:35:20.953 --> 01:35:21.173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

01:35:22.255 --> 01:35:23.897
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to get music or whatever.

01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:26.240
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm queuing up the first contender.

01:35:26.641 --> 01:35:27.682
[SPEAKER_05]: So good, I'm wasting time.

01:35:28.123 --> 01:35:36.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, F you to all the people who think that everyone who goes to the gym is just compensating for a small penis, because that's not true.

01:35:38.479 --> 01:35:39.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does that come from?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like going to the gym.

01:35:42.021 --> 01:35:42.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I am weak.

01:35:43.743 --> 01:35:49.927
[SPEAKER_05]: But lots of people who don't go to the gym, it's like, oh, you stupid people just go to the gym because you have penis envy or whatever.

01:35:51.368 --> 01:35:53.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's looking at me like a madman.

01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just confused.

01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:57.192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the gym, but I don't think it's a penis thing.

01:36:08.969 --> 01:36:15.395
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you would get a date, especially if they saw you doing your little ketchup chicken dance.

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about this, I'm trying to find a particular part of this song.

01:36:24.019 --> 01:36:25.740
[SPEAKER_18]: No, don't pose, please, don't pose.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:26.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:36:28.962 --> 01:36:29.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Posing is fun.

01:36:30.643 --> 01:36:31.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yes.

01:36:33.064 --> 01:36:39.487
[SPEAKER_04]: The cage match, the way the cage match works, we're going to play two new songs for you that are contenders for the title of the cage match champion.

01:36:39.967 --> 01:36:46.551
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote for either one of the two new songs, or you can vote for last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme that we just played for you.

01:36:47.011 --> 01:36:52.214
[SPEAKER_04]: And the winning song will be put into rotation all week long on our Bimani Music and More program, which plays...

01:36:53.214 --> 01:36:55.435
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time on this station when we're not live.

01:36:55.835 --> 01:36:59.477
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can vote for the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this one, the first contender.

01:37:00.037 --> 01:37:02.478
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a band that I've fucking fallen in love with lately.

01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:03.458
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this band.

01:37:03.478 --> 01:37:06.920
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a band called Frow Frow and this song is called Breathe In.

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh, it's cool.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.501
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool.

01:37:08.681 --> 01:37:09.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Frow Frow.

01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:11.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Frow Frow rules.

01:37:11.282 --> 01:37:11.862
[SPEAKER_04]: And this song...

01:37:12.182 --> 01:37:14.203
[SPEAKER_18]: Breathe In The Beginning of a Song by Bush

01:37:40.090 --> 01:38:08.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Breathe In, Breathe Out, Breathe In, Gotta Mushy Head Okay, okay, here we go This is the first contender, you can vote for it But we will not accept any votes until both songs have completely played So you can vote for either the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this This is Frow Frow with the DJ Encore mix of Breathe In here on Orange Lounge Radio I'm sorry, that's not where it's supposed to start It's supposed to start right in here Here we go This is it, Frow Frow

01:38:17.667 --> 01:38:19.633
[SPEAKER_08]: I need you.

01:38:20.656 --> 01:38:21.719
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I'm good at it.

01:38:22.301 --> 01:38:23.123
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so spotted.

01:40:09.474 --> 01:40:10.815
Thanks for watching!

01:42:49.213 --> 01:42:54.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was Frow Frow with the DJ Encore remix of Breathe In in the cage match.

01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:59.165
[SPEAKER_04]: So, next question we gotta ask is, what did you guys think of that one?

01:43:00.246 --> 01:43:01.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Dave?

01:43:02.028 --> 01:43:04.131
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that it was pretty good, but...

01:43:04.671 --> 01:43:07.612
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of long, I mean, almost.

01:43:08.453 --> 01:43:10.294
[SPEAKER_04]: It is six minutes, but I cut out the first minute.

01:43:10.474 --> 01:43:10.754
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:43:10.774 --> 01:43:11.514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I started a little there.

01:43:11.554 --> 01:43:24.040
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's still a little long, but I really think that it would go much better without the lyrics, because they just kind of brought it down and made it sound corny, in my opinion.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.560
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's fine.

01:43:26.461 --> 01:43:27.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, what did you think of Prowl Prowl?

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:29.962
[SPEAKER_18]: It reminded me of Forest.

01:43:31.243 --> 01:43:31.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

01:43:31.563 --> 01:43:32.564
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to take a nap.

01:43:32.584 --> 01:43:33.404
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

01:43:34.286 --> 01:43:35.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what'd you think of Frow Frow?

01:43:36.208 --> 01:43:37.489
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the voice was annoying.

01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:40.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love Imogen Heath, she rules.

01:43:40.151 --> 01:43:40.812
[SPEAKER_18]: Inya does dance.

01:43:41.012 --> 01:43:41.613
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not Inya!

01:43:42.273 --> 01:43:45.136
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to go to the bathroom during it, so I thought I had to be Inya.

01:43:45.697 --> 01:43:46.818
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I loved it.

01:43:46.878 --> 01:43:48.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Love, love, loved it, because I love Frow Frow.

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:49.380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, scale of 1 to 10.

01:43:50.061 --> 01:43:50.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

01:43:50.361 --> 01:43:50.341
6.

01:43:52.563 --> 01:43:53.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, Loki?

01:43:53.444 --> 01:43:53.864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go for 6.

01:43:54.685 --> 01:43:54.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave?

01:43:55.846 --> 01:43:54.985
7.

01:43:56.466 --> 01:43:57.828
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 10, it's perfect.

01:43:59.389 --> 01:43:59.749
[SPEAKER_04]: D.Va.

01:43:59.769 --> 01:44:00.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.642
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy Music DJ

01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:27.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, okay, I have to warn you guys, it does have a really strange intro and ending to it, just because this is a birthday gift to someone.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:33.887
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it'll get into the song, but just don't be thrown off by the annoying voices in the very beginning of it.

01:44:34.328 --> 01:44:37.252
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's an awesome remix of the Airship theme from Final Fantasy VII.

01:44:37.745 --> 01:44:38.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here it is.

01:44:38.886 --> 01:44:40.207
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Final Fantasy remix.

01:44:40.267 --> 01:44:42.828
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one win the cage match about three weeks ago, and here's another one.

01:44:43.328 --> 01:44:46.570
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the remix of the Airship theme from... Who does this?

01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:48.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the same guy who did the other one.

01:44:48.632 --> 01:44:50.393
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the FF Music DJ, I'm sorry.

01:44:51.273 --> 01:44:53.054
[SPEAKER_04]: I was only half paying attention because I was trying to queue it up.

01:44:53.494 --> 01:44:54.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

01:44:59.018 --> 01:45:00.619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spinning the CD and going.

01:45:00.679 --> 01:45:01.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:03.760
Hey, boy!

01:45:04.801 --> 01:45:06.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday!

01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:07.839
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

01:45:08.499 --> 01:45:09.940
[SPEAKER_08]: I made you a remix!

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.681
[SPEAKER_08]: Of Sam's theme!

01:45:13.521 --> 01:45:23.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me sing it for you!

01:45:30.605 --> 01:45:32.866
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like someone's, like, pleasuring themselves.

01:45:34.590 --> 01:45:35.633
Thank you for watching!

01:46:45.257 --> 01:46:45.817
Thanks for watching!

01:47:13.713 --> 01:47:14.457
Thanks for watching!

01:48:46.914 --> 01:48:47.755
Thank you for watching!

01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.101
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, that was it.

01:49:59.141 --> 01:50:05.404
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the FF Music DJ with the Final Fantasy VII Airship theme remix.

01:50:05.464 --> 01:50:07.245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little funky name to it here.

01:50:07.285 --> 01:50:09.906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Otan Jubi.

01:50:11.487 --> 01:50:12.447
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the real name of it.

01:50:12.927 --> 01:50:15.068
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's your other entrant in the cage match.

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:16.089
[SPEAKER_04]: So vote now.

01:50:16.169 --> 01:50:17.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send me a private message in the chat room.

01:50:18.190 --> 01:50:21.191
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote for... Oh yeah, sorry, we can do our opinions too.

01:50:21.591 --> 01:50:22.031
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

01:50:23.092 --> 01:50:24.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave said he liked it and gives it a 9.

01:50:26.611 --> 01:50:27.784
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say I like it and give it a 9.

01:50:30.703 --> 01:50:33.245
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it, so I give it a 9 too, I guess.

01:50:34.186 --> 01:50:37.509
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it, but not as much as Frow Frow, but I gave Frow Frow a 10, so I can give that a 9.

01:50:37.569 --> 01:50:41.793
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all gave that a 9.

01:50:42.613 --> 01:50:42.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

01:50:44.135 --> 01:50:46.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so, oh, did your entry get in?

[SPEAKER_06]: Watch it bounce.

01:50:55.204 --> 01:50:56.805

01:51:58.599 --> 01:51:59.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, no.

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I get nothing but spam.

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't, yeah, don't send spam.

01:52:02.181 --> 01:52:02.881
[SPEAKER_04]: I like good mail.

01:52:02.901 --> 01:52:04.642
[SPEAKER_04]: If you send spam, fuck you.

01:52:04.802 --> 01:52:05.202
[SPEAKER_18]: Send money.

01:52:05.442 --> 01:52:05.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:52:06.703 --> 01:52:08.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we had somebody vote for the Animal Crossing theme.

01:52:08.644 --> 01:52:13.526
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not one of your choices in today's... Maybe next week's Cage Match, but not tonight.

01:52:13.546 --> 01:52:15.007
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should play that once more tonight.

01:52:15.047 --> 01:52:16.707
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another Animal Crossing song.

01:52:16.947 --> 01:52:17.308
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that.

01:52:17.328 --> 01:52:19.188
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll close... Oh, okay.

01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:20.729
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll save it for later.

01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:24.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Do Animal Crossing music Cage Match.

01:52:24.391 --> 01:52:25.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, K.K.

01:52:25.131 --> 01:52:26.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Cospo would win, because that's my favorite.

01:52:27.853 --> 01:52:29.395
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's all about Lucky KK.

01:52:29.835 --> 01:52:32.097
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Riverdance and Animal Crossing.

01:52:34.379 --> 01:52:38.083
[SPEAKER_04]: SkylineDC505 says, isn't it too late to enter TourneyMix 3?

01:52:39.384 --> 01:52:42.627
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just missed the deadline by a half an hour.

01:52:42.667 --> 01:52:43.508
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean you got the deadline?

01:52:43.528 --> 01:52:44.930
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the deadline by just a half an hour.

01:52:45.150 --> 01:52:45.830
[SPEAKER_04]: So, half an hour.

01:52:47.572 --> 01:52:48.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, very good.

01:52:48.433 --> 01:52:52.417
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of things were you considering when you made your DWI?

01:52:53.086 --> 01:52:54.406
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of things was considered?

01:52:54.546 --> 01:52:55.186
[SPEAKER_04]: What went into it?

01:52:55.226 --> 01:52:56.427
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you pick the song?

01:52:56.487 --> 01:52:58.007
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you design the steps?

01:52:58.347 --> 01:52:59.907
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you do the background?

01:53:00.168 --> 01:53:03.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the song I picked actually was my second choice.

01:53:03.368 --> 01:53:07.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had a first choice, which is Alien World from 8Style.

01:53:07.829 --> 01:53:09.130
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have that halfway done.

01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:11.190
[SPEAKER_06]: I just decided, no, I like the song better.

01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:12.510
[SPEAKER_06]: So I picked that song.

01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:19.932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bit succinct because the second part of the song... The whole song kind of slows down as it's going through gradually, but...

01:53:20.852 --> 01:53:30.538
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to edit it down, and the second half of the song, or second third of the song, last third of the song, there we go, is 128.036 BPM.

01:53:31.878 --> 01:53:32.519
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exact.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:43.065
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, though, is Stepmania and DWI don't do three digit BPMs, at least not without editing the file itself.

01:53:43.525 --> 01:53:50.729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finally got it synced, except there's like one step that's not synced, which I don't really give a crap, because it's one step and no one's going to notice.

01:53:51.149 --> 01:53:54.871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's off by like 1 64th of a note, so I really don't care.

01:53:55.393 --> 01:54:01.698
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, the background took me, uh, maybe 10, 15 minutes to do.

01:54:02.098 --> 01:54:03.700
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it all in Photoshop, looks pretty.

01:54:04.641 --> 01:54:08.744
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, the steps I finished just before I got here for the show.

01:54:08.864 --> 01:54:10.926
[SPEAKER_06]: I finished the heavy step stairs.

01:54:11.246 --> 01:54:17.671
[SPEAKER_06]: A part in it where it's, it goes kind of, it's, I think it starts off at like 135, goes down to this, oh wait, what is it?

01:54:17.691 --> 01:54:19.673
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um, one...

01:54:21.314 --> 01:54:25.357
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember, it goes down to half speed in the middle, and then it comes back up to 128.

01:54:26.558 --> 01:54:33.903
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the half speed part, there's a 30 second note thing going on there, so it's kind of hard to read, but it's all synced.

01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:37.005
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I don't know, they're pretty fun.

01:54:37.345 --> 01:54:41.548
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of plays like Era, but a little bit more complicated.

01:54:41.848 --> 01:54:43.309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just try it out.

01:54:43.949 --> 01:54:44.350
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:46.311
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

01:54:46.923 --> 01:54:47.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

01:54:47.964 --> 01:54:56.029
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think are going to be the big sim files to watch out for, the big artists, or the big creators out there that are going to have some good stuff?

01:54:56.129 --> 01:55:10.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think BimaniRuler is putting anything in this time, so they'll probably just have CMCM do something, then KamenKey makes a lot of stuff, VitaX, whatever, does a lot of stuff.

01:55:11.658 --> 01:55:12.178
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know.

01:55:12.218 --> 01:55:13.438
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that know.

01:55:13.679 --> 01:55:17.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Or DDR Master F, you know, might see something from him.

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Moogle Hunter, definitely.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:27.102
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I don't know, it's always surprising because you'll see people that you've never heard of and then just all of a sudden they'll come out with something pretty cool.

01:55:27.142 --> 01:55:28.622
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really hard to tell.

01:55:29.503 --> 01:55:32.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait until they have an actual list of what's on there.

01:55:32.043 --> 01:55:34.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll kind of see what they try out.

01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:40.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to enter, but I got lazy, so I'll enter MakeEditGetPorn instead or something.

01:55:41.092 --> 01:55:43.534
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I don't want any of the porn that Loki's given away.

01:55:43.574 --> 01:55:49.697
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a really cool, you know, well, I made a really cool background for his song.

01:55:49.757 --> 01:55:54.939
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished the basic and trick steps, I just only got about three measures into the maniac steps, so whatever.

01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, fuck contests, fuck them right in the ear.

01:55:58.641 --> 01:56:00.542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just release it because I'm cool.

01:56:01.503 --> 01:56:04.084
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be, I don't have to whore it out under any contest.

01:56:04.704 --> 01:56:05.465
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm me, dammit.

01:56:07.608 --> 01:56:08.910
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a special contest.

01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:13.378
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Sky Owns You at SimFiles, so nobody wins except Sky.

01:56:13.658 --> 01:56:16.242
[SPEAKER_06]: I could run a tourney mix, but I just don't have the web space.

01:56:17.585 --> 01:56:19.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to rip off a big idea anyway.

01:56:19.969 --> 01:56:21.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it at GetPorn's cooler anyway.

01:56:22.404 --> 01:56:23.285
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, here's the thing.

01:56:23.525 --> 01:56:26.786
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how they were going to have a special category where you actually had to pay to get in?

01:56:26.826 --> 01:56:28.227
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to have prizes?

01:56:28.707 --> 01:56:29.828
[SPEAKER_06]: They aren't having that no more.

01:56:29.928 --> 01:56:30.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a bummer.

01:56:30.428 --> 01:56:30.868
[SPEAKER_04]: No one entered.

01:56:31.248 --> 01:56:31.868
[SPEAKER_04]: No one entered.

01:56:32.048 --> 01:56:32.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise!

01:56:32.489 --> 01:56:33.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to pay money.

01:56:33.909 --> 01:56:34.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:35.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyways.

01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:37.651
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that fell through.

01:56:37.711 --> 01:56:40.772
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can always do mine where I give out anime DVDs.

01:56:40.892 --> 01:56:41.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

01:56:41.312 --> 01:56:41.753
[SPEAKER_02]: DVDs!

01:56:42.213 --> 01:56:43.013
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

01:56:43.593 --> 01:56:43.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:56:45.074 --> 01:56:47.935
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back.

01:56:47.975 --> 01:56:48.596
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

01:56:48.716 --> 01:56:49.376
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break...

01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:51.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com

01:57:18.627 --> 01:57:23.608
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off with the Freshness in India Amazing Mix.

01:57:23.668 --> 01:57:27.068
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from DCB, and his remixes are always very interesting.

01:57:27.929 --> 01:57:30.109
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB had a very cool one the other day.

01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:34.030
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a remix of Happy Meal that we played on a fuck-off that ended with the theme to Hey Dude.

01:57:36.370 --> 01:57:39.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was like the coolest Nickelodeon show ever.

01:57:39.171 --> 01:57:40.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Dude.

01:57:40.451 --> 01:57:41.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me see if I can find it.

01:57:41.591 --> 01:57:42.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

01:57:43.011 --> 01:57:45.772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to the end of the Happy Meal Evil Mix here, just so I can play this.

01:57:48.399 --> 01:57:48.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.981
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the end of here.

01:57:50.001 --> 01:57:51.823
[SPEAKER_09]: That show was the shit.

01:58:07.848 --> 01:58:11.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's turning this shade of red I've never seen before from laughing so hard at that.

01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:14.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, okay, DCB, I've got a challenge for you.

01:58:14.532 --> 01:58:20.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, DCB, if you do this, I swear to God, we'll put it in a cage match, we will get it in rotation somehow.

01:58:20.815 --> 01:58:26.878
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to do a remix that somehow involves the old school, you can't do that on television theme.

01:58:28.379 --> 01:58:29.220
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can do that...

01:58:30.465 --> 01:58:32.386
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll, like, give Sweet Lovin' to you or something.

01:58:32.406 --> 01:58:33.187
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be just awesome.

01:58:33.227 --> 01:58:33.587
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be rad.

01:58:33.607 --> 01:58:36.389
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to have samples from... You have to have samples.

01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, what's that guy?

01:58:41.792 --> 01:58:42.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Alistair?

01:58:44.614 --> 01:58:44.874
[SPEAKER_18]: J.D.

01:58:44.914 --> 01:58:45.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross?

01:58:45.194 --> 01:58:45.514
[SPEAKER_06]: J.D.

01:58:45.554 --> 01:58:45.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross.

01:58:45.754 --> 01:58:46.435
[SPEAKER_06]: You need J.D.

01:58:46.495 --> 01:58:48.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross clips in that song.

01:58:48.916 --> 01:58:51.638
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I want someone to do a remix of the She-Ra theme.

01:58:54.139 --> 01:58:55.340
[SPEAKER_18]: I can even send you the song.

01:58:57.144 --> 01:58:58.745
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB says this before his time.

01:58:58.825 --> 01:58:59.285
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

01:59:00.446 --> 01:59:01.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't care.

01:59:01.426 --> 01:59:02.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Just find it.

01:59:02.307 --> 01:59:05.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Find an old episode of Kazan, watch it, because it was the fucking shit.

01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:13.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to play a DCB remix, Freshness in India, and then we're going to play something from Joe Mama called... I don't have my files queued up.

01:59:13.893 --> 01:59:14.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look.

01:59:14.453 --> 01:59:15.554
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's a cool song.

01:59:16.554 --> 01:59:18.455
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's called Messy Closet.

01:59:18.475 --> 01:59:20.196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're going to play from Joe Mama.

01:59:20.536 --> 01:59:21.877
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll play something from Loki.

01:59:22.477 --> 01:59:23.778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what Loki songs I have.

01:59:23.838 --> 01:59:24.198
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:59:24.578 --> 01:59:26.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Is any of these yours, Loki?

01:59:27.404 --> 01:59:27.644
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowStyle

01:59:57.704 --> 01:59:58.485
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here we go.

01:59:58.765 --> 02:00:00.006
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:53.755 --> 02:00:57.139
Thank you for watching!

02:01:54.551 --> 02:01:55.432
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

02:02:38.204 --> 02:02:41.126
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was Freshness in India by DCB.

02:02:41.146 --> 02:02:44.149
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes Joe Mama with Messy Closet.

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.283
Thanks for watching!

02:05:10.849 --> 02:05:14.994
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was Joe Mama with Messy Closet.

02:05:15.034 --> 02:05:16.595
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're going to do a Loki original.

02:05:16.635 --> 02:05:17.897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Shadow Style.

02:07:39.571 --> 02:07:44.474
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey there, it's your point of Megaskin, warning you to listen to Orange Wild every Sunday.

02:07:52.058 --> 02:08:02.463
[SPEAKER_25]: Not just because it's the best eeeee money radio out there, but because if you don't, I will personally come to your house and do a nori nori nori routine.

02:08:02.823 --> 02:08:05.685
[SPEAKER_25]: And believe me, nobody wants to see that.

02:08:10.086 --> 02:08:22.795
[SPEAKER_23]: So remember, listen to Orange Lounge, because I don't want to have to have anyone suffer through this.

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:32.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, yes, we're back.

02:08:32.702 --> 02:08:33.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to suffer through that.

02:08:34.163 --> 02:08:34.723
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I did it.

02:08:34.783 --> 02:08:38.486
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to make the promo play loud enough so we could all actually hear it, so I hope you enjoyed that.

02:08:38.526 --> 02:08:38.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Squee.

02:08:39.367 --> 02:08:39.627
[SPEAKER_04]: Squee.

02:08:41.998 --> 02:08:42.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:08:43.979 --> 02:08:46.540
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a list list soon, but we've got to prepare our list.

02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.060
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to hold off on that for a little bit.

02:08:49.601 --> 02:08:52.221
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will be the top three things that ruined the internet.

02:08:52.381 --> 02:08:53.902
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be talking about that later.

02:08:55.802 --> 02:08:56.943
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, let's see.

02:08:56.983 --> 02:08:57.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have any other topics?

02:08:58.143 --> 02:08:59.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we need to announce the cage match winner.

02:09:00.004 --> 02:09:01.004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing we need to talk about.

02:09:02.604 --> 02:09:03.185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

02:09:04.025 --> 02:09:04.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Cage Match.

02:09:05.345 --> 02:09:08.286
[SPEAKER_04]: The song that will be in rotation all next week.

02:09:08.366 --> 02:09:10.387
[SPEAKER_04]: The winner, ladies and gentlemen...

02:09:11.696 --> 02:09:19.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks in a row, the Knight Rider theme has won the Orange Lounge game match.

02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:24.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I will knock the Knight Rider theme down next week.

02:09:25.402 --> 02:09:27.403
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark my words, it'll be gone.

02:09:27.423 --> 02:09:30.804
[SPEAKER_09]: You wish.

02:09:33.112 --> 02:09:35.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we do have a rule, though, that how many weeks do we say?

02:09:35.875 --> 02:09:36.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Four weeks?

02:09:36.915 --> 02:09:37.156
[SPEAKER_04]: Month.

02:09:37.476 --> 02:09:37.876
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a month.

02:09:38.177 --> 02:09:40.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the song can't be in for more than a month, or it's gone.

02:09:40.619 --> 02:09:41.319
[SPEAKER_04]: We retire it.

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.345
[SPEAKER_04]: We get Carson Daly out here to retire your song from Total Orange Request Live.

02:09:51.255 --> 02:09:54.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week it'll be Tom Green's Piggy Hill.

02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:57.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.

02:09:58.644 --> 02:10:00.286
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down.

02:10:00.366 --> 02:10:01.948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down.

02:10:02.028 --> 02:10:03.510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.

02:10:03.810 --> 02:10:04.751
[SPEAKER_06]: That for about five minutes.

02:10:05.492 --> 02:10:08.135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna trump all you fuckers and put in the legend.

02:10:10.598 --> 02:10:11.598
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:10:40.276 --> 02:10:40.877
[SPEAKER_18]: Skillfully done.

02:10:41.257 --> 02:10:42.298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm no match for Brad.

02:10:44.499 --> 02:10:47.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you preparing your list for listless now while I'm just sitting here ranting?

02:10:47.382 --> 02:10:47.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:10:47.862 --> 02:10:48.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

02:10:48.623 --> 02:10:50.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we won't have to take another break.

02:10:50.504 --> 02:10:51.905
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just be able to go right into lists.

02:10:51.945 --> 02:10:52.886
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to think about mine.

02:10:53.306 --> 02:10:57.029
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's play one song while we prepare our list, shall we?

02:10:58.130 --> 02:10:59.211
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play one quick song.

02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:01.433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be something fun.

02:11:01.513 --> 02:11:01.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:11:03.194 --> 02:11:04.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Instant love.

02:11:04.775 --> 02:11:06.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, everybody loves instant love.

02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

02:11:10.721 --> 02:11:12.802
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be right back with the list list.

02:11:12.842 --> 02:11:14.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Top three things that ruined the internet right after this.

02:11:18.885 --> 02:11:21.827
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

02:11:22.948 --> 02:11:27.570
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

02:11:28.211 --> 02:11:30.792
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

02:11:31.693 --> 02:11:33.734
[SPEAKER_13]: The objects will come down from the top.

02:11:34.094 --> 02:11:35.315
[SPEAKER_13]: When it hits the red line,

02:11:41.191 --> 02:11:42.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn the table!

02:11:42.656 --> 02:11:43.419
[SPEAKER_13]: You get it?

02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:45.526
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's practice!

02:12:16.138 --> 02:12:16.398
Easy, huh?

02:12:16.418 --> 02:12:18.740
Alright, let's go on to the scratch stage.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.262
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

02:12:21.362 --> 02:12:24.143
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

02:12:53.130 --> 02:12:54.112
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

02:14:05.047 --> 02:14:10.368
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it Hello, we're back

02:14:32.253 --> 02:14:33.093
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:04.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we shall see.

02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:05.071
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, go get the door.

02:15:05.091 --> 02:15:06.732
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought some fun music.

02:15:06.772 --> 02:15:07.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know you did.

02:15:07.633 --> 02:15:08.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some things that we could do.

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:10.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, am I looking in the cookie?

02:15:10.355 --> 02:15:11.416
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm looking in the wrong directory.

02:15:12.857 --> 02:15:18.222
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you had... Oh, Dave's parents are here already, I guess.

02:15:18.242 --> 02:15:19.242
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

02:15:21.724 --> 02:15:22.665
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, they're pulling Dave away from us.

02:15:22.685 --> 02:15:23.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, they're pulling Dave away.

02:15:23.606 --> 02:15:24.667
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do about Listless?

02:15:27.749 --> 02:15:28.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:15:28.070 --> 02:15:28.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him to leave his list here, because we've got to do his list.

02:15:32.203 --> 02:15:32.783
[SPEAKER_18]: His list is here.

02:15:33.143 --> 02:15:33.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Is his list still here?

02:15:35.405 --> 02:15:37.146
[SPEAKER_18]: His list is here.

02:15:37.506 --> 02:15:40.548
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have a person from our chatroom vote for our song.

02:15:41.448 --> 02:15:43.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll have a person from the chatroom vote for the song.

02:15:43.469 --> 02:15:46.331
[SPEAKER_18]: Or maybe we'll just all pile together and see which one we all agree on.

02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:47.912
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have a person... No, he's still here.

02:15:48.092 --> 02:15:48.632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's still here.

02:15:52.935 --> 02:15:54.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just read my top three real quick?

02:15:55.576 --> 02:15:56.657
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to eliminate one?

02:15:57.284 --> 02:15:57.584
[SPEAKER_04]: Chainletters

02:16:23.811 --> 02:16:25.335
[SPEAKER_05]: and points I should say.

02:16:26.879 --> 02:16:27.400
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that.

02:16:28.964 --> 02:16:29.766
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say it later.

02:16:29.846 --> 02:16:30.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:16:32.152 --> 02:16:32.914
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta go.

02:16:35.989 --> 02:16:36.369
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye!

02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:40.011
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, he took one of mine.

02:16:43.213 --> 02:16:43.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, Dave.

02:16:44.033 --> 02:16:49.816
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna make a special surprise phone call to one of our listeners to have them pick something to eliminate off the list.

02:16:49.836 --> 02:16:50.436
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that later.

02:16:51.076 --> 02:16:52.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start sending me your phone numbers.

02:16:52.877 --> 02:16:55.378
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have the person picked out that we're gonna call, so just shut up.

02:16:55.799 --> 02:16:58.300
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have to think of the number, too, because he took mine.

02:16:59.545 --> 02:17:01.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll read those again.

02:17:01.927 --> 02:17:06.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Dave's parents gone so I can read some of these?

02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:08.891
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you poke your head out the door please real fast, Matt?

02:17:09.151 --> 02:17:09.692
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone.

02:17:11.213 --> 02:17:12.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Those top three once again from Dave.

02:17:12.834 --> 02:17:21.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who instant message you, chain letters, and porn sites that say that they're free but they really aren't.

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.141
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case you missed those.

02:17:23.201 --> 02:17:26.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now let's get back to the three of us here.

02:17:27.484 --> 02:17:28.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Boots my inserts on, my bad.

02:17:32.555 --> 02:17:33.696
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Jamie.

02:17:34.236 --> 02:17:34.637
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

02:17:34.697 --> 02:17:36.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number three choice, please.

02:17:36.698 --> 02:17:37.279
[SPEAKER_18]: Microsoft.

02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft ruined the Internet.

02:17:40.461 --> 02:17:49.649
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, because of all their, you know, the MSM you can't delete from your computer and all of their little sending them all your crap.

02:17:50.630 --> 02:17:51.891
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I should say spyware.

02:17:53.372 --> 02:17:54.713
[SPEAKER_18]: But Microsoft in particular.

02:17:55.293 --> 02:17:55.654
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:17:56.875 --> 02:17:59.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft in particular ruined the Internet.

02:17:59.397 --> 02:18:00.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, Loki.

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:01.378
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the Internet?

02:18:01.538 --> 02:18:01.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

02:18:03.446 --> 02:18:07.008
[SPEAKER_06]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

02:18:08.489 --> 02:18:15.312
[SPEAKER_18]: Could I have a funny story about... 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

02:18:15.372 --> 02:18:16.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please tell your story.

02:18:17.093 --> 02:18:18.214
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:18:18.414 --> 02:18:20.595
[SPEAKER_18]: This is when my fiancé had just gotten online.

02:18:20.615 --> 02:18:22.916
[SPEAKER_18]: He was using my friend Julie's account, and she had a catwoman name.

02:18:24.617 --> 02:18:30.020
[SPEAKER_18]: And this guy propositioned him, thinking it was a woman for sex.

02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:31.261
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like cyber...

02:18:32.034 --> 02:18:37.396
[SPEAKER_18]: So what they did is they ended up taking him into the IM and talking about power tools the whole time.

02:18:37.856 --> 02:18:39.897
[SPEAKER_18]: The guy's like, so what do you want to do first?

02:18:40.097 --> 02:18:44.138
[SPEAKER_18]: And Dan replies, I have a circular saw.

02:18:44.219 --> 02:18:45.259
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you like jigsaws?

02:18:46.459 --> 02:18:47.820
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a reciprocating saw.

02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:49.841
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole time.

02:18:51.141 --> 02:18:52.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he ever saw that he was being duped?

02:18:53.882 --> 02:18:56.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Cybersex is funny because it's so pointless.

02:18:57.884 --> 02:18:58.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:18:59.818 --> 02:19:00.118
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:02.580
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:19:03.041 --> 02:19:03.441
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

02:19:04.842 --> 02:19:05.283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating.

02:19:06.183 --> 02:19:11.588
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three choice, as tempting as it was to put some popular websites, you know, DDR Freak, things like that.

02:19:11.748 --> 02:19:12.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

02:19:12.188 --> 02:19:12.569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

02:19:14.170 --> 02:19:20.055
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick was another website that I believe ruined the Internet, and that website is GeoCities.

02:19:22.576 --> 02:19:27.120
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that Geocities ruined the internet by allowing any dumb fuck to have a homepage.

02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:29.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people should not have webpages.

02:19:30.082 --> 02:19:32.524
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Geocities pages are cool, admittedly.

02:19:32.924 --> 02:19:37.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the banners fucked them up, you know, their little pop-up thing that they have on the right.

02:19:37.287 --> 02:19:38.188
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Bads?

02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:40.290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, I know.

02:19:40.450 --> 02:19:41.911
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some cool things on Geocities.

02:19:42.872 --> 02:19:43.492
[SPEAKER_04]: But 98% of it is shit.

02:19:46.155 --> 02:19:52.722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fuckin' sorority girls that put up pretty pink webpages with dancing pictures of doggies and pictures of their cat.

02:19:52.782 --> 02:19:53.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody gives a shit.

02:19:53.643 --> 02:20:00.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my other website, uh, Loki's Insan- or was it, uh, uh, Sensory Deprivation.

02:20:00.130 --> 02:20:00.510
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

02:20:01.131 --> 02:20:02.072
[SPEAKER_06]: A site I don't update.

02:20:02.512 --> 02:20:02.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.

02:20:02.793 --> 02:20:03.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Find it if you can.

02:20:03.634 --> 02:20:04.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

02:20:04.114 --> 02:20:05.275
[SPEAKER_04]: GeoCity's ruined the internet.

02:20:07.017 --> 02:20:07.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie!

02:20:08.717 --> 02:20:09.777
[SPEAKER_21]: Your number two pick, please.

02:20:10.117 --> 02:20:10.897
[SPEAKER_18]: Bad fandom.

02:20:11.878 --> 02:20:17.879
[SPEAKER_18]: As in people who write fanfics and do fanart that I don't agree with.

02:20:17.919 --> 02:20:19.779
[SPEAKER_18]: For lack of a better description.

02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:25.580
[SPEAKER_18]: Like people who do crossover fanfics.

02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:30.962
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not talking about good crossovers, but people who do really bad ones.

02:20:31.342 --> 02:20:33.962
[SPEAKER_18]: Like things that could not ever happen.

02:20:35.202 --> 02:20:37.943
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I write fanfiction, that's fine.

02:20:40.202 --> 02:20:42.584
[SPEAKER_18]: The Internet is a haven for bad writers.

02:20:43.464 --> 02:20:47.067
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a haven for good writers, too, but you really have to look through a lot of shit to find it.

02:20:47.327 --> 02:20:53.592
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's people who put up their art, and they obviously haven't spent any time practicing.

02:20:53.772 --> 02:21:00.717
[SPEAKER_18]: And I understand if maybe you're learning and you're improving, but I've seen slides of people whose art gets continuously worse.

02:21:01.177 --> 02:21:02.598
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they IM me.

02:21:03.619 --> 02:21:05.260
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:25.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to GeoCities, because DarkTetsuya wanted to point out that his website's on GeoCities.

02:21:26.175 --> 02:21:27.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you're part of that cool 2%.

02:21:28.337 --> 02:21:28.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.

02:21:29.438 --> 02:21:32.340
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying 98% of the GeoCities webpages, they're ass.

02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:34.222
[SPEAKER_18]: But compared to what you have now, was it ass?

02:21:40.667 --> 02:21:42.788
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually decent for... For it's time.

02:21:42.828 --> 02:21:43.709
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ahead of it's time.

02:21:43.749 --> 02:21:45.730
[SPEAKER_18]: For a HTML done in WordPad.

02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:46.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:46.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:47.231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:21:47.491 --> 02:21:49.112
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you didn't use that auto-generator.

02:21:49.132 --> 02:21:49.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alright.

02:21:50.212 --> 02:21:50.732
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool then.

02:21:51.113 --> 02:21:51.913
[SPEAKER_18]: That is bullshit.

02:21:51.933 --> 02:21:53.014
[SPEAKER_18]: I either use that or Dreamweaver.

02:21:53.154 --> 02:21:53.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:21:53.454 --> 02:21:53.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

02:21:54.014 --> 02:21:54.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Good girl.

02:21:54.534 --> 02:21:54.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:21:55.675 --> 02:21:56.956
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had Bad Fandom.

02:21:58.857 --> 02:22:00.197
[SPEAKER_04]: And now Loki's number two pit.

02:22:00.237 --> 02:22:00.697
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

02:22:01.778 --> 02:22:05.040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I guess I can go with... Okay, fine.

02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:05.340
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.201
[SPEAKER_06]: The lack of e-prostitutes.

02:22:07.721 --> 02:22:09.262
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy everything online but women.

02:22:12.082 --> 02:22:14.872
[SPEAKER_18]: you can buy a wife you can buy a wife

02:22:15.933 --> 02:22:16.734
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a wife.

02:22:16.954 --> 02:22:17.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:22:18.455 --> 02:22:19.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:22:19.716 --> 02:22:20.876
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to research this now.

02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.062
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, you can get a mail order bride.

02:22:31.103 --> 02:22:36.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking up our old friends from, oh, I guess, is this it?

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:37.147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is it.

02:22:37.587 --> 02:22:40.469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking up our old friends at the Bunny Ranch from Under Sedation Live.

02:22:40.509 --> 02:22:41.790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find their website.

02:22:42.551 --> 02:22:45.813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to see if we can see, ah, easy online reservations.

02:22:46.493 --> 02:22:47.834
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a prostitute online.

02:22:47.854 --> 02:22:50.655
[SPEAKER_04]: You can reserve a prostitute on the internet.

02:22:51.776 --> 02:22:52.616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.

02:22:52.636 --> 02:22:54.657
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just like making a reservation at a hotel.

02:22:54.677 --> 02:22:57.519
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not buying the friggin' hotel and having that hotel shipped to your house.

02:22:57.599 --> 02:22:58.779
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright, alright, alright.

02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.701
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want a site that's actually going to ship a woman to your house?

02:23:01.721 --> 02:23:03.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddammit, I'm getting all these pop-up ads.

02:23:03.862 --> 02:23:05.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Those bastards.

02:23:05.683 --> 02:23:07.444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like, you know, something like, um...

02:23:07.924 --> 02:23:11.105
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, um, like, uh, Red Octane, you know?

02:23:11.385 --> 02:23:16.227
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay... Are you comparing Red Octane to prostitution?

02:23:16.627 --> 02:23:17.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it could be, okay?

02:23:18.268 --> 02:23:25.291
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay a certain amount of money for, like, a monthly fee, they send a woman to your house with a shipping label, you know, when you're down a third and then you ship her off back.

02:23:26.151 --> 02:23:32.674
[SPEAKER_18]: The site you're looking for is called realdolls.com Oh my god.

02:23:33.809 --> 02:23:35.893
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually sit in the same room with you every Sunday.

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:39.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my number two pick for thing that ruined the internet.

02:23:40.361 --> 02:23:41.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, this is a good one.

02:23:43.086 --> 02:23:44.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two thing that ruined the internet.

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:46.131
[SPEAKER_04]: ICQ.

02:23:50.985 --> 02:23:54.746
[SPEAKER_04]: I... ICQ back in the day was alright.

02:23:54.826 --> 02:23:59.748
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was one of the first instant messaging programs before, like, cool ones like Yahoo showed up.

02:23:59.788 --> 02:24:05.591
[SPEAKER_04]: And AOL, even though AOL's kind of crappy now, AOL Instant Messenger's still cool.

02:24:07.291 --> 02:24:10.713
[SPEAKER_04]: But ICQ is like the shithole of IMs.

02:24:10.773 --> 02:24:11.093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

02:24:12.196 --> 02:24:16.860
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the program that people who don't know how to use any other instant messenger program use.

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:18.421
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot stand ICQ.

02:24:18.881 --> 02:24:19.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the weirdest...

02:24:20.994 --> 02:24:22.495
[SPEAKER_04]: messages from people on ICQ.

02:24:22.595 --> 02:24:26.076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use ICQ anymore because of random people on ICQ.

02:24:26.576 --> 02:24:35.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if I have one more, like, 16-year-old woman from Brazil emailing me over ICQ wanting me to go to some website to see her boobs, I'm gonna scream.

02:24:36.019 --> 02:24:37.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I need to get on ICQ.

02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:45.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ICQ constantly sends you ads, and now it's all, like, added out and stuff, and they sold it out to the man.

02:24:47.282 --> 02:24:49.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since ICQ sold out, they've sucked.

02:24:49.603 --> 02:24:51.143
[SPEAKER_04]: ICQ ruined the internet.

02:24:52.304 --> 02:24:53.924
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I have my number one.

02:24:54.044 --> 02:24:58.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's hear DarkSakura's number one thing that ruined the internet.

02:24:58.525 --> 02:24:59.386
[SPEAKER_18]: Lazy typing.

02:25:00.166 --> 02:25:03.367
[SPEAKER_18]: As in people who use the letter U instead of writing Y-O-U.

02:25:04.487 --> 02:25:05.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy typing.

02:25:05.868 --> 02:25:07.648
[SPEAKER_18]: Or P-L-Z for please.

02:25:08.969 --> 02:25:10.309
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, you know...

02:25:11.678 --> 02:25:16.839
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't mind Lee, but I've also put for the lazy writing too, I want to add in Asian typing too.

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:23.501
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't mind Lee, but I really, really hate all the rest of it.

02:25:23.821 --> 02:25:25.702
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it makes people look ignorant, okay?

02:25:26.242 --> 02:25:30.803
[SPEAKER_18]: There are people who, they start typing that way to me, I'll be like, type English, you know?

02:25:32.605 --> 02:25:33.746
[SPEAKER_18]: I will completely ignore them.

02:25:33.926 --> 02:25:38.047
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be like, I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that the letter U stands alone as its own word.

02:25:38.887 --> 02:25:42.709
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I'll go check it on dictionary.com and post them a link and everything.

02:25:42.869 --> 02:25:43.709
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I hate it.

02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:48.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so lazy and Asian typing.

02:25:48.951 --> 02:25:52.652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that's funny because it's very similar to my number one, but I think my number one's a little different.

02:25:52.712 --> 02:25:53.433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different enough.

02:25:54.293 --> 02:25:57.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, your number one thing that ruined the internet.

02:25:57.374 --> 02:25:58.254
[SPEAKER_04]: He's already laughing.

02:25:59.555 --> 02:26:00.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Mac users.

02:26:02.847 --> 02:26:03.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't leave it at that.

02:26:05.388 --> 02:26:06.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

02:26:09.289 --> 02:26:10.589
[SPEAKER_04]: You care to back that up?

02:26:10.629 --> 02:26:13.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think somebody's going to have a severe problem with this.

02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:15.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I kind of wanted to change one of mine on there.

02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:17.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can go back in a little bit.

02:26:18.191 --> 02:26:18.591
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:26:18.611 --> 02:26:21.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you want to kind of back up your answer a little bit here?

02:26:21.792 --> 02:26:23.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Mac users ruin the Internet?

02:26:24.062 --> 02:26:24.542
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26:46.374 --> 02:26:48.037
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually rethought my Bad Fandom one.

02:26:48.057 --> 02:26:48.578
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

02:26:48.598 --> 02:26:49.119
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to change that?

02:26:49.139 --> 02:26:50.782
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everyone has to start somewhere.

02:26:51.623 --> 02:26:54.207
[SPEAKER_18]: And Bad Fandom just encourages people to go look for the good stuff.

02:26:54.247 --> 02:26:54.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:26:54.508 --> 02:26:55.329
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

02:26:55.409 --> 02:26:57.232
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually going to take that off the list anyway.

02:26:57.272 --> 02:26:58.835
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to change it to Pop-Up Ads.

02:26:59.055 --> 02:26:59.616
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop-Up Ads.

02:26:59.676 --> 02:26:59.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:27:02.426 --> 02:27:04.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because pop-up ads need to be on there.

02:27:04.067 --> 02:27:05.508
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting rid of bad fandom and putting on pop-up ads.

02:27:05.528 --> 02:27:08.209
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to need the negative to encourage people to look for the positive.

02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:09.630
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody had to start somewhere.

02:27:09.930 --> 02:27:11.791
[SPEAKER_18]: So I retract it and apologize.

02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:12.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:27:13.812 --> 02:27:15.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab's having a fit in the chat room.

02:27:15.813 --> 02:27:16.214
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

02:27:16.354 --> 02:27:16.734
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:27:16.814 --> 02:27:17.774
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that on purpose.

02:27:17.794 --> 02:27:19.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you did it on purpose just to piss them off?

02:27:21.196 --> 02:27:21.476
[SPEAKER_04]: You go.

02:27:21.496 --> 02:27:22.117
[SPEAKER_04]: You ass.

02:27:23.678 --> 02:27:24.238
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool.

02:27:24.738 --> 02:27:25.939
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't have a third one.

02:27:26.179 --> 02:27:29.621
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, by the way, we might have a special in-studio guest Black Lab here next week.

02:27:30.146 --> 02:27:31.466
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just kidding, Black Lab.

02:27:31.486 --> 02:27:34.407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking it off as my pick to remove from the list.

02:27:34.427 --> 02:27:35.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright, alright.

02:27:35.487 --> 02:27:36.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

02:27:36.047 --> 02:27:37.167
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

02:27:37.187 --> 02:27:37.847
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

02:27:37.887 --> 02:27:38.847
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

02:27:39.068 --> 02:27:39.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I read number one?

02:27:40.088 --> 02:27:41.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do my number one thing now?

02:27:41.528 --> 02:27:41.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:27:42.328 --> 02:27:44.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one thing that ruined the internet, in my opinion.

02:27:45.249 --> 02:27:46.309
[SPEAKER_04]: The caps lock key.

02:27:48.129 --> 02:27:49.129
[SPEAKER_18]: God, yes.

02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:52.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, where's my music?

02:27:53.370 --> 02:27:53.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:27:54.730 --> 02:27:56.610
[SPEAKER_04]: The caps lock key ruined the internet.

02:27:57.611 --> 02:27:59.071
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ever use it.

02:27:59.511 --> 02:27:59.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

02:28:00.515 --> 02:28:03.779
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time you can use it is if you're me and you're doing the listless segment.

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:05.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm doing right now.

02:28:06.102 --> 02:28:08.685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only time you can ever use the cap slot key.

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, use shift.

02:28:11.589 --> 02:28:13.571
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you don't type in all caps.

02:28:13.952 --> 02:28:14.712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I hate?

02:28:14.732 --> 02:28:19.038
[SPEAKER_04]: If I see one more person at my work typing caps, I'm gonna cry.

02:28:19.751 --> 02:28:24.573
[SPEAKER_06]: You can change mine if you want for Mac users to MIDI music that plays when you go to webpages.

02:28:25.353 --> 02:28:27.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're changing Mac users now?

02:28:27.134 --> 02:28:27.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

02:28:27.674 --> 02:28:33.676
[SPEAKER_18]: Except my old DarkSakura page has MIDI's that play, but that was because at the time I thought it was cool.

02:28:33.696 --> 02:28:36.257
[SPEAKER_18]: GeoCities, by the way, will not let me take down that page.

02:28:38.018 --> 02:28:39.699
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still up there, my old DarkSakura page.

02:28:40.039 --> 02:28:40.540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:41.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Why won't they let you take it down?

02:28:41.881 --> 02:28:42.701
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no idea.

02:28:42.721 --> 02:28:43.322
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't.

02:28:43.762 --> 02:28:50.147
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually after GeoCities and Yahoo did their little, you know, they screwed and, you know, spawned something.

02:28:51.008 --> 02:28:52.689
[SPEAKER_18]: So I haven't been able to log into my old accounts.

02:28:53.493 --> 02:28:56.095
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, notice all the commercials for Yahoo.

02:28:56.395 --> 02:29:01.518
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they promote Yahoo as a meeting place for, like, the scum of the earth.

02:29:02.078 --> 02:29:06.981
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got, like, the dating ad with people with big hands and that really ugly chick that's an astronaut.

02:29:07.001 --> 02:29:10.503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they just show ugly, nasty people that are on Yahoo.

02:29:10.803 --> 02:29:12.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Who'd want to be on Yahoo with all these freaks?

02:29:13.485 --> 02:29:14.866
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying Yahoo ruined the internet?

02:29:16.266 --> 02:29:20.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yahoo... Internet commercials ruin the internet, okay?

02:29:21.112 --> 02:29:22.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late, we have our list.

02:29:22.174 --> 02:29:22.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read the list.

02:29:22.915 --> 02:29:23.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:29:23.976 --> 02:29:25.698
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the list as it stands currently.

02:29:25.818 --> 02:29:27.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who IM you.

02:29:27.821 --> 02:29:28.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Chain letters.

02:29:29.182 --> 02:29:31.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn sites that say they're free but really not.

02:29:31.806 --> 02:29:32.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

02:29:32.807 --> 02:29:46.814
[SPEAKER_04]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities, pop-up ads, lack of e-prostitutes, ICQ, lazy typing or Asian typing, MIDI music that plays when you go to websites, and the caps lock key.

02:29:47.315 --> 02:29:51.997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that all being said, Jamie, what is coming off this list?

02:29:52.037 --> 02:29:52.918
[SPEAKER_04]: What ain't so bad?

02:29:53.078 --> 02:29:54.278
[SPEAKER_18]: Lack of e-prostitutes.

02:29:54.499 --> 02:29:56.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of e-prostitutes.

02:29:56.199 --> 02:29:58.461
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't really give a care about sluts.

02:30:01.101 --> 02:30:04.483
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you want to say with that, or just, you don't like sluts?

02:30:05.464 --> 02:30:06.264
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like sluts.

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:09.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm getting an early vote already, it is not time to vote.

02:30:10.326 --> 02:30:11.867
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB, your vote doesn't count.

02:30:13.348 --> 02:30:16.490
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to wait, because that thing you voted for might come up.

02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:18.071
[SPEAKER_04]: You get smacked with the ferret.

02:30:20.512 --> 02:30:21.173
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret's over here.

02:30:21.593 --> 02:30:22.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're doing a slash me.

02:30:26.468 --> 02:30:28.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

02:30:28.769 --> 02:30:29.570
[SPEAKER_04]: She took the keyboard.

02:30:29.850 --> 02:30:34.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have to wait for Jamie to... Alright, I can do mine because I already... Oh, you already know what it is?

02:30:34.653 --> 02:30:35.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:30:36.074 --> 02:30:43.278
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine has to go... I'm going to take off the porn sites that say they're free but really aren't because free porn sites are like the Fountain of Youth.

02:30:43.298 --> 02:30:43.999
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't exist.

02:30:50.002 --> 02:30:51.223
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't know where to look.

02:30:52.657 --> 02:30:54.317
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as free porn sites.

02:30:54.417 --> 02:30:56.878
[SPEAKER_06]: There are back doors to porn sites, which are awesome.

02:30:56.918 --> 02:30:57.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, back doors.

02:30:58.539 --> 02:30:59.779
[SPEAKER_06]: HappyHacker.com.

02:30:59.859 --> 02:31:02.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy-Hacker.com.

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:03.420
[SPEAKER_06]: PersianKitty.com.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:05.500
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe.

02:31:05.801 --> 02:31:07.721
[SPEAKER_06]: DoubleXPassword.com.

02:31:07.841 --> 02:31:08.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, this isn't that good.

02:31:08.901 --> 02:31:10.022
[SPEAKER_16]: Find me some boy porn, man porn.

02:31:10.962 --> 02:31:11.802
[SPEAKER_16]: Find me man porn.

02:31:13.383 --> 02:31:13.763
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it free?

02:31:13.943 --> 02:31:14.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:31:19.844 --> 02:31:21.885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all boys and boys, though, but anyway.

02:31:23.470 --> 02:31:27.092
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have a DVD, but I got rid of it pretty quickly once I got it.

02:31:27.332 --> 02:31:29.453
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those free Vivid DVDs that they gave me.

02:31:32.094 --> 02:31:35.136
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get them anymore, but... Alright.

02:31:35.876 --> 02:31:36.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, back to listless.

02:31:36.997 --> 02:31:37.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I gotta take that off.

02:31:37.877 --> 02:31:39.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn sites say they're free, but really not.

02:31:40.999 --> 02:31:41.659
[SPEAKER_04]: That comes off the list.

02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:44.261
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn to take something off the list.

02:31:45.321 --> 02:31:48.343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take off, um... Hmm...

02:31:51.351 --> 02:31:53.573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take off MIDI music that plays when you go to websites.

02:31:54.053 --> 02:31:56.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of my old websites also had a MIDI song to play in the background.

02:31:56.615 --> 02:31:57.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, they're cool.

02:31:58.236 --> 02:31:59.757
[SPEAKER_18]: Mine played Street Fighter MIDI.

02:31:59.857 --> 02:32:00.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine played Tori Amos.

02:32:02.739 --> 02:32:04.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine, I should just reiterate.

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:06.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, MIDI music's not that bad.

02:32:07.462 --> 02:32:12.165
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it, it's annoying, but I hate the sites that make you download MP3s to get into the site.

02:32:12.285 --> 02:32:13.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

02:32:13.186 --> 02:32:13.966
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

02:32:13.986 --> 02:32:16.388
[SPEAKER_06]: What, is that like a porn thing?

02:32:16.408 --> 02:32:20.230
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of times when someone tries to play MIDI music, all you have to do is hit stop, and it, you know.

02:32:21.511 --> 02:32:22.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's Good Cool's site.

02:32:23.633 --> 02:32:24.193
[SPEAKER_06]: That does that.

02:32:24.293 --> 02:32:24.674
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

02:32:24.974 --> 02:32:25.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Good Cool.

02:32:25.855 --> 02:32:26.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad.

02:32:27.016 --> 02:32:27.296
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

02:32:27.416 --> 02:32:27.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Good Cool.

02:32:28.076 --> 02:32:29.157
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Ryo Nagumi.

02:32:29.538 --> 02:32:30.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Nagumu.

02:32:30.638 --> 02:32:30.919
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:32:31.059 --> 02:32:32.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Nagu something.

02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:40.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm going to try this phone thing, and we've all had really bad experiences with this in the past, so I'm going to call someone who I'm pretty confident is listening to the show.

02:32:42.028 --> 02:32:48.653
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little upset that Loki took the Mac users thing off the list, because this would have been an exciting telephone conversation if that were the case.

02:32:49.053 --> 02:32:57.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, why don't you get one of those car hookups for your phone, and then you can plug it into the microphone thing here, and then everyone can hear it.

02:32:58.017 --> 02:32:59.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's too easy!

02:33:00.459 --> 02:33:02.339
[SPEAKER_18]: Julie's going to be giving us a real phone hookup.

02:33:02.359 --> 02:33:03.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's a really good idea.

02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:06.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to be looking into the phone hookup thing, don't worry about it.

02:33:06.802 --> 02:33:09.283
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, we don't have that, so here we go.

02:33:11.824 --> 02:33:13.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me place that phone call here.

02:33:23.726 --> 02:33:28.048
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a lovely building.

02:33:29.008 --> 02:33:30.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Black Lab.

02:33:30.869 --> 02:33:31.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

02:33:31.689 --> 02:33:32.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear us fine?

02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:36.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything you want to say to Loki first off?

02:33:37.711 --> 02:33:40.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Loki, screw you, man.

02:33:42.453 --> 02:33:49.895
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were there right now, I'd whip out a whole sheet of information that I could shove in your face and prove you wrong.

02:33:50.176 --> 02:33:51.156
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to defend you.

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:58.585
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell phone thing sounds like crap, so we can't stay on this too long, but... Do you need me to read the list for you?

02:33:58.625 --> 02:34:00.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you already have something that you want to come off the list?

02:34:04.209 --> 02:34:04.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is.

02:34:05.470 --> 02:34:07.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who instant message you.

02:34:08.052 --> 02:34:08.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Chain letters.

02:34:09.593 --> 02:34:11.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

02:34:11.434 --> 02:34:13.035
[SPEAKER_04]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

02:34:14.486 --> 02:34:22.671
[SPEAKER_04]: GeoCities, PopUp Ads, ICQ, Lazy or Asian Typing, and CapsLockKey.

02:34:24.372 --> 02:34:28.315
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying people should stop being lazy and set up an email filter?

02:34:28.335 --> 02:34:28.515
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:47.280
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thanks for participating, Black Lab.

02:34:48.261 --> 02:34:48.581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:34:48.821 --> 02:34:49.361
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.

02:34:49.461 --> 02:34:49.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

02:34:51.242 --> 02:34:53.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, Orange Haunts Radio phone call like wood.

02:34:53.022 --> 02:34:56.423
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised you didn't take off 40-year-old women pretending to be men just to piss me off.

02:34:56.763 --> 02:34:58.824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everyone else has already eliminated my stuff.

02:34:58.844 --> 02:35:00.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, already taken off your choices?

02:35:00.144 --> 02:35:00.544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

02:35:01.305 --> 02:35:04.786
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be a popular thing around here is people eliminating your picks.

02:35:04.846 --> 02:35:05.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

02:35:07.605 --> 02:35:10.607
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pick random shit, I don't actually answer seriously.

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:13.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see, are you mocking this segment?

02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're doing?

02:35:15.391 --> 02:35:23.357
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just I think it's more entertaining to pick really weird shit instead of actual serious answers because everyone else has the same answers I would have used, so there.

02:35:24.278 --> 02:35:24.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:35:25.319 --> 02:35:28.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you can vote now during our listless segment.

02:35:28.061 --> 02:35:29.302
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take one last break.

02:35:30.194 --> 02:35:31.295
[SPEAKER_18]: Read off the list one more time.

02:35:31.395 --> 02:35:31.715
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

02:35:31.875 --> 02:35:33.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we're going to read off the list one more time.

02:35:33.235 --> 02:35:34.436
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to post it in the chat room.

02:35:34.456 --> 02:35:34.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:35:34.796 --> 02:35:35.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's what we have.

[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that's not for me.

02:36:10.428 --> 02:36:12.069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

02:36:12.449 --> 02:36:15.370
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one come from somebody else listening to the show.

02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:16.851
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot to read it, but we'll get to it.

02:36:17.411 --> 02:36:23.674
[SPEAKER_04]: So, top three things that ruin the internet when we come back from this break featuring some Beatmania final music.

[SPEAKER_21]: Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Monty Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

02:41:15.681 --> 02:41:25.646
[SPEAKER_21]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

02:41:26.626 --> 02:41:30.048
[SPEAKER_04]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:31.168 --> 02:41:33.669
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 24.

02:41:34.770 --> 02:41:36.671
[SPEAKER_04]: We're wrapping it up in the last segment here.

02:41:37.231 --> 02:41:37.672
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Jamie?

02:41:37.792 --> 02:41:38.392
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're special.

02:41:38.612 --> 02:41:39.192
[SPEAKER_04]: We're special.

02:41:39.653 --> 02:41:40.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Special Ed.

02:41:40.893 --> 02:41:41.834
[SPEAKER_18]: Special enough for the Olympics.

02:41:42.534 --> 02:41:44.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie and I are planning on some late night boba, too.

02:41:44.615 --> 02:41:45.215
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be fun.

02:41:45.375 --> 02:41:45.616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:41:45.936 --> 02:41:46.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Boba's always a winner.

02:41:46.896 --> 02:41:49.017
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone in the Davis area, come hang out with us.

02:42:02.828 --> 02:42:04.751
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have about two liters of Pepsi in me.

[SPEAKER_04]: Any Bomani song that's been released in 2002.

02:42:23.676 --> 02:42:27.659
[SPEAKER_04]: And we might also do one if we've got time for, like, best thing in the Bomani world for 2002.

[SPEAKER_04]: Although there's some other things to get a vote.

02:43:33.701 --> 02:43:36.301
[SPEAKER_04]: And some interesting things that were said in the chat room.

02:43:36.361 --> 02:43:38.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Things we didn't put on the list at all.

[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB suggested that Orange Lounge in fact ruined the internet.

02:43:43.244 --> 02:43:44.364

[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, wait a minute, you gave me Alan Rickman movies, so I'm not going to kick you, but I'll hit you with a ferret.

02:43:57.740 --> 02:44:00.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says the ferret ruined the internet.

02:44:05.286 --> 02:44:06.807

02:44:17.451 --> 02:44:18.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did eBay ruin the internet?

02:44:18.792 --> 02:44:20.474
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it makes me spend all my money.

02:44:21.715 --> 02:44:25.918
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, Half.com has been taking up more of my money lately because I've been finding laser discs.

02:44:26.358 --> 02:44:28.880
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a good one would be LiveJournal ruined the internet.

02:44:28.980 --> 02:44:29.981
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I like LiveJournal.

02:44:30.001 --> 02:44:36.426
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what sucks is I have the money and I have the actual, I just don't have the space.

02:44:36.746 --> 02:44:39.008
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have bought a Beatmania Complete Mixer 500.

02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:41.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Dang.

02:44:41.710 --> 02:44:42.571
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have stored it for you.

02:44:44.915 --> 02:44:45.876
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little late now, though.

02:44:46.096 --> 02:44:46.957

02:50:30.527 --> 02:50:33.408
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, go under the language preferences and look at the list of languages.

02:50:33.648 --> 02:50:35.328
[SPEAKER_18]: You can browse in Esperanto.

02:50:36.448 --> 02:50:37.129
[SPEAKER_18]: That's brilliant.

02:50:39.669 --> 02:50:42.049
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would say Google improved the internet.

02:50:42.149 --> 02:50:44.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Web.archive.org, I believe it's called.

02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:45.610
[SPEAKER_18]: Yahoo email is good.

02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:47.290
[SPEAKER_04]: The archiver thing.

02:50:47.330 --> 02:50:49.071
[SPEAKER_04]: The web archiver improved the internet.

02:50:49.091 --> 02:50:49.571
[SPEAKER_18]: The anonymizer.

02:50:50.351 --> 02:50:51.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Anonymizer.

02:50:51.533 --> 02:50:54.916
[SPEAKER_18]: But Yahoo Email is pretty good because they've built in a spam filter.

02:50:55.836 --> 02:50:56.957
[SPEAKER_04]: PopUpKiller.

02:50:57.978 --> 02:50:58.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Save the internet.

02:50:58.879 --> 02:50:59.299
[SPEAKER_18]: AdAware.

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.461
[SPEAKER_04]: AdAware improved the internet completely.

02:51:02.502 --> 02:51:03.142
[SPEAKER_18]: Kazalite.

02:51:03.923 --> 02:51:05.184
[SPEAKER_18]: File sharing with no adware.

02:51:05.364 --> 02:51:05.524
[SPEAKER_04]: WinMX.

02:51:05.564 --> 02:51:05.844
[SPEAKER_04]: WinMX.

02:51:06.425 --> 02:51:06.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Napster.

02:51:08.734 --> 02:51:15.817
[SPEAKER_18]: Back to the Day, Back to the Day, Audio Galaxy, because people told Audio Galaxy to take it down, and Audio Galaxy said, hey, fuck you.

02:51:15.857 --> 02:51:18.378
[SPEAKER_04]: PHPBB2 is being suggested by SoCalCase.

02:51:18.398 --> 02:51:21.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:24.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there an email to read?

02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:25.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

02:51:25.401 --> 02:51:26.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Black Lab's my hero.

02:51:26.461 --> 02:51:27.922
[SPEAKER_04]: He reminded me that we had email in the box here.

02:51:27.982 --> 02:51:30.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Easyboard.com ruined the internet.

02:51:30.283 --> 02:51:31.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that's beautiful.

02:51:31.643 --> 02:51:31.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:51:32.403 --> 02:51:33.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Sakbemani has salvaged the internet.

02:51:34.838 --> 02:51:37.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakmamani completely improved the internet as did Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:38.261 --> 02:51:39.422
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, DDR Freak.

02:51:42.544 --> 02:51:44.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, stop looking at me!

02:51:46.507 --> 02:51:50.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I had one more FU, we never got to read.

02:51:51.431 --> 02:51:55.594
[SPEAKER_04]: So, shit, where's that FU music I had earlier for our chat room?

02:51:55.995 --> 02:51:56.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:51:57.336 --> 02:51:57.716
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it.

02:51:59.177 --> 02:52:00.418
[SPEAKER_18]: Stand by to bitch.

02:52:00.919 --> 02:52:01.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

02:52:01.259 --> 02:52:01.319
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

02:52:04.968 --> 02:52:15.492
[SPEAKER_04]: F, persons from Hicktown I don't know that made me 4-1, screwing me out of a medal at my wrestling tournament, and my Mac, my dad gave me an early Christmas present, and I book WooFuckingWho.

02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:17.173
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what the email says.

02:52:17.193 --> 02:52:19.293
[SPEAKER_04]: That came from Martin Tan.

02:52:19.353 --> 02:52:19.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:52:22.314 --> 02:52:25.536
[SPEAKER_18]: I've decided something that I want the chat room to do for me, or all of our listeners.

02:52:25.696 --> 02:52:26.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have a command.

02:52:27.057 --> 02:52:27.297
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

02:52:29.259 --> 02:52:31.260
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially people in the LiveJournal community or whatever.

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:34.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you still have the link to that sorting quiz that I gave you?

02:52:35.729 --> 02:52:39.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, if you can remember the first few... It was at Virtual Hogwarts.

02:52:41.535 --> 02:52:43.197
[SPEAKER_18]: No, just do a search for it on Google.

02:52:43.898 --> 02:52:48.002
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm rather curious because I'm still in my little fan phase right now.

02:52:48.503 --> 02:52:52.106
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see where everybody in the chat room would find themselves sorted.

02:52:53.007 --> 02:52:56.211
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want them to take the sorting quiz that is like the best one ever.

02:52:56.676 --> 02:52:58.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Hogwarts?

02:52:58.757 --> 02:52:59.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it this one?

02:52:59.538 --> 02:53:00.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hogwarts?

02:53:00.699 --> 02:53:00.979
[SPEAKER_04]: This one?

02:53:01.399 --> 02:53:01.680
[SPEAKER_04]: This one?

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:02.640
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven Dragons?

02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:02.920
[SPEAKER_04]: That one?

02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:03.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:05.742
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to post a link in the chat room, and I want everyone to take it.

02:53:05.782 --> 02:53:09.225
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it asks you to pick your preference for a house, pick no preference.

02:53:09.705 --> 02:53:09.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:53:09.805 --> 02:53:10.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to see where it puts you.

02:53:11.166 --> 02:53:12.267
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're going to do this.

02:53:12.287 --> 02:53:15.089
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to say, there's a little link on there that says...

02:53:15.589 --> 02:53:16.089
[SPEAKER_18]: Get sorted.

02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:17.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Get sorted.

02:53:17.130 --> 02:53:18.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Click here to be sorted.

02:53:18.571 --> 02:53:19.952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the left column.

02:53:20.492 --> 02:53:24.415
[SPEAKER_04]: At the very end of the quiz, it'll ask you if you have a preference for a house.

02:53:24.515 --> 02:53:25.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Click no preference.

02:53:26.156 --> 02:53:31.100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right underneath the... Because if you've seen the recent movies, you'll know that if you have a preference, that's what you're going to get.

02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:32.501
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, twins, shut up.

02:53:35.022 --> 02:53:40.186
[SPEAKER_18]: So... You wonder why you're on my... I got Slytherin, by the way.

02:53:40.206 --> 02:53:41.627
[SPEAKER_04]: I took this test and I sorted into Slytherin.

02:53:41.647 --> 02:53:42.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get Slytherin.

02:53:43.917 --> 02:53:46.158
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lep says he already took it and he's in Ravenclaw.

02:53:46.559 --> 02:53:47.339
[SPEAKER_18]: You're a nerd.

02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:53.442
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, make sure it's this test that you took.

02:53:53.683 --> 02:53:57.164
[SPEAKER_04]: So take this test and find out where you get sorted.

02:53:57.505 --> 02:53:58.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell us in the chat room.

02:53:59.005 --> 02:54:00.146
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to tell you there.

02:54:01.527 --> 02:54:05.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Email it to the Orange Lounge Radio and we'll make a tally.

02:54:05.509 --> 02:54:06.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Or post it in the Live Journal community.

02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:08.671
[SPEAKER_18]: When we get back from Bobo, I'll put up a link in the...

02:54:09.275 --> 02:54:11.876
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks wants you to know he loves you, by the way, DarkSakura.

02:54:12.276 --> 02:54:13.516
[SPEAKER_18]: Aww, I love you too.

02:54:14.296 --> 02:54:22.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so go take that test, email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and let us know where you were sorted, because Jamie is that big of a Harry Potter nerd that she has to know.

02:54:22.859 --> 02:54:24.599
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should start the personality quiz of the week.

02:54:25.219 --> 02:54:26.340
[SPEAKER_04]: The personality quiz of the week?

02:54:27.980 --> 02:54:29.240
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, somebody quit the twin.

02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:29.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:54:34.648 --> 02:54:35.449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kick him again.

02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:36.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you want to kick him again?

02:54:36.729 --> 02:54:37.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and take the keyboard.

02:54:37.810 --> 02:54:41.112
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I'm going to ask Loki, what's your final thought of the day?

02:54:41.672 --> 02:54:45.795
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought of the day is I'm going home and working my website.

02:54:46.355 --> 02:54:49.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I don't know, I have nothing better to do.

02:54:50.718 --> 02:54:51.618
[SPEAKER_06]: I did my work for the week.

02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:56.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's furiously trying to kick.

02:54:59.261 --> 02:55:00.562
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:55:00.762 --> 02:55:02.063
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're waiting for your edits.

02:55:02.624 --> 02:55:04.485
[SPEAKER_06]: I just haven't gotten around to it.

02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:10.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now that that's over.

02:55:11.951 --> 02:55:13.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with the site.

02:55:14.012 --> 02:55:15.634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll finish my thing.

02:55:16.374 --> 02:55:21.218
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the edits yet because I'm lazy and haven't made them yet.

02:55:21.838 --> 02:55:22.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:23.720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:28.984
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, SoCalKicks is waiting for the MaxUSA edits for his site.

02:55:31.089 --> 02:55:36.994
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, if you still want to host the edits that I've made for you, by the way, I'll go ahead and send them to you again, but be forewarned.

02:55:37.414 --> 02:55:39.876
[SPEAKER_18]: My DexDrive died.

02:55:40.216 --> 02:55:44.740
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, if anyone happens to find a DexDrive anywhere in their town... I have a spare.

02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:46.321
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I want it.

02:55:46.661 --> 02:55:47.602
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll pay you five bucks for it.

02:55:48.322 --> 02:55:52.566
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie had that look on her face when Loki took the mic away, like, you asshole!

02:55:52.646 --> 02:55:55.148
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden when Loki said that, she was like, oh, never mind.

02:55:56.889 --> 02:55:57.830
[SPEAKER_18]: You live for now.

02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:01.371
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, he has them.

02:56:01.431 --> 02:56:01.872
[SPEAKER_04]: They're up.

02:56:01.892 --> 02:56:02.552
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not linked.

02:56:02.913 --> 02:56:03.473
[SPEAKER_18]: I have new ones.

02:56:03.773 --> 02:56:04.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:05.635
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get some of mine up there, too.

02:56:05.655 --> 02:56:06.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be neat?

02:56:06.715 --> 02:56:07.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Squeak.

02:56:08.297 --> 02:56:14.221
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought of the week is I hate people that I go out on dates with.

02:56:14.281 --> 02:56:14.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate them all.

02:56:15.362 --> 02:56:22.007
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides, you can have the results or the winners from my MakeEditGetPorn contest.

02:56:22.027 --> 02:56:23.528
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all MaxUSA edits.

02:56:23.869 --> 02:56:24.689
[SPEAKER_17]: Whee!

02:56:25.390 --> 02:56:25.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

02:56:27.011 --> 02:56:28.472
[SPEAKER_18]: I should enter that just for the hell of it.

02:56:29.133 --> 02:56:29.493
[SPEAKER_18]: You should.

02:56:31.997 --> 02:56:32.438
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

02:56:46.818 --> 02:56:47.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

02:56:48.679 --> 02:56:49.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I guess that's it.

02:56:50.301 --> 02:56:53.823
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to point out... Oh, there's the fortune cookie in the directory all by itself, Jamie?

02:56:53.963 --> 02:56:55.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then we'll have that all taken care of.

02:56:56.565 --> 02:56:57.205
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

02:56:57.225 --> 02:56:59.527
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week when we're going to do our holiday wrap-up.

02:57:00.748 --> 02:57:01.728
[SPEAKER_04]: And... This one?

02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:02.529
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:57:03.109 --> 02:57:05.891
[SPEAKER_04]: And... That'll be it?

02:57:07.352 --> 02:57:08.813
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to do a tape show on the 29th?

02:57:08.833 --> 02:57:10.274
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do my final thought!

02:57:10.354 --> 02:57:10.995
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you did.

02:57:11.235 --> 02:57:12.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my bad, Jamie.

02:57:12.116 --> 02:57:12.996
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kicking twins.

02:57:13.036 --> 02:57:13.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, sorry.

02:57:14.197 --> 02:57:15.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, yes, your final thought?

02:57:19.742 --> 02:57:20.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, that was riveting.

02:57:20.827 --> 02:57:22.854
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go and watch all of these Alan Rickman movies.

02:57:24.542 --> 02:57:27.663
[SPEAKER_22]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:28.223 --> 02:57:31.563
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:57:32.164 --> 02:57:37.365
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

02:57:37.605 --> 02:57:48.087
[SPEAKER_22]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:57:48.387 --> 02:57:49.827
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a special moment right now.

02:57:49.847 --> 02:57:53.728
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home

02:57:54.525 --> 02:57:56.346
[SPEAKER_01]: Send your parents out of the room, this is a kid's song.

02:57:57.968 --> 02:58:01.350
[SPEAKER_14]: Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

02:58:01.390 --> 02:58:04.713
[SPEAKER_14]: Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now.

02:58:05.073 --> 02:58:07.635
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, if you know the words, sing along!

02:58:07.875 --> 02:58:11.358
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed.

02:58:11.578 --> 02:58:14.340
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna have to go to school until you're 17.

02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:16.822
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna seem about three times as long as that.

02:58:18.146 --> 02:58:19.907
