00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Message for you, son! Attention! Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Top, and then some.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Just kidding. Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Showgirls.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Absolutely frightening.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Don't torture yourself.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Now's the time our sprockets pay me dogs.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I don't get you, my pretty.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And your little dog, too.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Why did they have to take the word game?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect for Spanish Exposition is kingdom.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark sacral.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sky.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
We are live and this is episode number 24.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
For December the 15th of 2002, you're tuned into the Blamani Scene's most hilarious radio station of all things Blamani.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, for you and my gnomious sky.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the Happiest Bunny on the Farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Bird? Bird? Bird is the word?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm freezing.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
This is so crazy, wait, is that just me?

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Hello. Hi, our mics weren't loud enough during that whole intro. My bad, you wanna say hello again, Jamie?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I said I was cold, dammit.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And Loki, you wanna say hello again? Ah, sure, whatever.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Sorry about that. We're still new at this. 24 episodes into this, we still don't know what the fuck we're doing.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Uh, anyway, we got a whole bunch of fun things to talk about tonight, but, uh, we'll get to that pretty soon.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Actually, I don't know what the hell we're gonna talk about tonight. I think it's just, uh...

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
The holidays kill everything, don't they?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Uh, sure.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Moki's kind of panicking right now, by the way.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
What's the matter?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay, uh, my attorney makes three entry. It's all done. I just need to upload it.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
My dial-up doesn't want to upload it, and I have to upload it here, but we can't because the stream, you know, might get cut out, so I'm stuck.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I have it on a CD, it's all done. I just can't get into it.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.560
Alright, well, we'll panic about Loki's situation in the meantime, we're going to take a quick

03:36.560 --> 03:40.560
And we will be right back. Enjoy!

05:06.560 --> 05:22.280
All right, here's something being brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.480
It's some tracks from the new Good Cool compilation that was just recently released.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.600
We're going to play a couple tracks here for you.

05:28.600 --> 05:35.600
We're going to play Spooky and Shake It Down back-to-back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

05:58.600 --> 06:05.600
You must be everything

06:05.600 --> 06:11.600
Any other love you want

06:11.600 --> 06:15.600
You must be

06:15.600 --> 06:17.600

07:36.600 --> 07:40.600

Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

10:24.400 --> 10:33.040
Hello, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.040
That was horrible.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.560
I told you you'd hate it.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.560
It's kind of funny.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.560
Haven't you ever heard that song?

10:38.560 --> 10:39.560
That Missy Elliott song?

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
Do I listen to that?

10:40.560 --> 10:43.040
Yeah, I know you don't listen to pop music, but whatever.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.600
Just because I have taste.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.920
Oh well, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.560
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10:53.560 --> 10:58.560
And that was some stuff from the Good Cool CD, by the way.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.220
Spooky and Shake It Down, those were the two songs you heard back to back.

11:02.220 --> 11:06.280
Before that, Blake Down, a song that I just pulled out of my ass because I didn't have

11:06.280 --> 11:07.640
anything else queued up.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.680
Oh, the chat room seemed to enjoy that promo, so they got the joke.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.680
That's good.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
How you doing?

11:14.680 --> 11:16.040
Loki is still over there panicking?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.040
Yeah.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.760
Twen tried to get you a, Twen couldn't shed his big fat mouth and tried to get you a waiver

11:21.760 --> 11:26.060
or something, but now they said, no, you gotta get it in by midnight.

11:26.060 --> 11:30.260
Eastern? Yeah, this guy said Eastern, but if you notice

11:30.260 --> 11:35.580
their web page doesn't say anything, so I don't know, you could sue. You should take

11:35.580 --> 11:40.220
him to Judge Judy. I don't give a crap.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.900
That's okay, because the only one that matters is make Eddick get porn, right?

11:43.900 --> 11:48.340
Yeah. That's okay, because we have a backup plan,

11:48.340 --> 11:51.700
so Loki's okay, it's just my roommate's gotta get home in enough time for us to, you know,

11:51.700 --> 11:55.580
into a system and upload something break it that's oh hey good suggestion

11:55.580 --> 12:03.700
instead of Judge Judy Judge Jamie you need a bookmark yes use that all right

12:03.700 --> 12:09.000
hey so how was your week I'm reading Harry Potter during the break you're

12:09.000 --> 12:13.420
wearing this lovely new Slytherin scarf to go with your new obsession new

12:13.420 --> 12:21.260
obsession well somewhat it's new to this year though isn't it it's not like the

12:21.260 --> 12:24.980
official one because the official ones were made really cheaply and kind of

12:24.980 --> 12:27.980
look stupid because they have like the house logo on them I think they look

12:27.980 --> 12:33.640
stupid but this is a handmade scarf in green and gray it's the Slytherin color

12:33.640 --> 12:37.100
so I wear it and it's made to look like the ones in the movies and it's warm and

12:37.100 --> 12:41.480
comfy. Some folks in the chat room are indicating they've read all four books

12:41.480 --> 12:44.600
which one's your favorite? Oh Goblet of Fire.

12:44.600 --> 12:49.600
Goblet of Fire was the best. All right cool. Just because of the whole ending my

12:49.600 --> 12:52.360
God that was beautiful.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.940
Okay so did anyone do anything

12:55.940 --> 12:59.760
oh, we have a special special guest tonight in the chat room. This makes me happy.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.940
This makes me moist as a snack cake ladies and gentlemen.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.760
DJ Morpheus my old buddy from Understation Live, Travis

13:05.760 --> 13:09.940
in the chat room tonight and he's saying oh that reminds me I need to send Jamie a pick

13:09.940 --> 13:12.260
of the Sakura Japanese restaurant sign out here.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.600
Yes! I want to see signs with my name on them.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.840
And he's saying by the way, he also said that Understation Live 3.0

13:18.840 --> 13:21.840
is going to be debuting in January. Exciting!

13:21.840 --> 13:25.960
Stay tuned to understationlive.org for all the details. If you enjoyed last

13:25.960 --> 13:29.000
week's match game segment, we totally ripped that off understationlive, but that was a

13:29.000 --> 13:30.600
rip-off. It was a tribute, not a rip-off.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.080
Oh yes, a tribute. Yes, a tribute. That was in turn a tribute to the, you know,

13:34.080 --> 13:38.200
classic game show, because it rules. I was actually, I actually was just watching that the other day.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.960
My favorite, Charles Nelson Reilly.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.560
Biggest flaming homosexual in the seventies.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.560
And you're using your Mr. Spanky voice.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.560
Yes, my Mr. Spanky voice is inspired by Charles Nelson Reilly.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.560
The fair degrees.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.560
The little bush baby.

13:57.560 --> 14:03.560
Ah, yes. Black Lab says Game Show Network rules. Game Show Network does rule.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.560
I love the Game Show Network.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.560
Except Wind Tuition.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.560
Except for those of us who don't have cable anymore.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.560
What the fuck is Wind Tuition? That show sucks.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.560
It has the guy from Double Dare hosting it, no, I want to...

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
Mark Summers is cool, but not on that show.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
Do you know who produces that show?

14:19.560 --> 14:22.560
Who? Is it a Mark Goodson television production?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.560
No, Henry Winkler or whatever.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.560
The Fonz.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
Oh, the Fonz?

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
The Fonz.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
No way.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.560
Because the Fonz is cool.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.560
Oh, we actually have Bahmani news to report, go figure.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
We actually have some things going on in the Bahmani community.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.560
There was a big tournament on Friday in the bay.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.760
Friday in the Bay. There was the Miggle Evil Tournament 2, I believe it was called. Am

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
I right? Evil Tournament 2?

14:44.760 --> 14:45.760
I wanted to go.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.120
I wanted to go too, but that whole Friday thing meant, you know, we'd have to drive.

14:49.120 --> 14:55.120
I didn't get anything out of work until 6.30, and I got off work at 5.30 and was there until

14:55.120 --> 14:58.960
nearly 6.30 because Dan wasn't off work yet, so grrr.

14:58.960 --> 15:03.480
I just didn't want to drive out there in the rain. I'm sorry. Hearing that the whole damn

15:03.480 --> 15:06.980
thing started late, I probably could have made it in time, but I just didn't want to

15:06.980 --> 15:11.020
driving the rain my apologies to the folks there but you know I just I get

15:11.020 --> 15:17.340
all freaked out driving in storms who would I would have cried anyway oh yeah

15:17.340 --> 15:22.580
we wanted to we wanted to read the results to you from the tournament so in

15:22.580 --> 15:29.580
perfect attack fourth place went to emphasis nice job emphasis third place

15:29.580 --> 15:35.440
went to virtually don't call him the max 300 King or he'll kick your ass second

15:35.440 --> 15:42.280
First place went to Chubbs, and first place, this is the hugest surprise of the century,

15:42.280 --> 15:43.280
Tigger.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.280
Really?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
Gasp.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Oh my God.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
Gasp.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.880
They did this whole new little bracket thing though that was kind of cool.

15:50.880 --> 15:55.280
What they do, and this is kind of cool, we should talk about this kind of different ideas,

15:55.280 --> 15:56.640
ways to run a tournament.

15:56.640 --> 16:01.600
They took a bracket of 16, and what they did, you know, just like normal, except instead

16:01.600 --> 16:06.520
Instead of the person losing the last match, just automatically getting second place, what

16:06.520 --> 16:12.480
they did is they removed Tigger out of the bracket and replayed all the matches that

16:12.480 --> 16:15.500
would have been affected by his presence, basically.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.760
And so they determined a second place that way.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.520
It's kind of interesting the way it works, but it sounded very cool and I guess it worked

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
out pretty well.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.520
Sounds neat.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.160
So that was pretty cool.

16:26.160 --> 16:41.600
Freestyle, 3rd place went to a fellow called Hamsterhead, 2nd place went to 001, I thought

16:41.600 --> 16:49.000
it was 007, 00 something got 2nd place, DCB here typed all these results to me and I thought

16:49.000 --> 16:55.520
it was 007, it could have been 001, I don't know. In first place, starting to win a lot

16:55.520 --> 17:00.620
of these freestyle competitions lately, it's the wonderful, the awesome, the incredible

17:00.620 --> 17:06.260
Bruce Leroy taking first place. Apparently his routine was insertion, he did this whole

17:06.260 --> 17:10.900
little Spiderman thing to it, so we'll figure. I have to look for the videos. Yes, we'll

17:10.900 --> 17:14.800
be eagerly awaiting those videos. Some friends of Orange Lounge were competing in that, by

17:14.800 --> 17:15.800
By the way, too?

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
Okay.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.800
Yes.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
So...

17:18.800 --> 17:19.800
Word.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.920
I don't know, what else is there to talk about Bamani News?

17:24.920 --> 17:28.600
There are rumors saying that DDR Extreme is going to be released on Christmas.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.120
Yeah, I think there's any truth to that.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.640
That sounds kind of early to me.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.800
Christmas is a commercial holiday in Japan.

17:35.800 --> 17:41.240
Of course, that's not far off from here, but even so, I don't think that they would put

17:41.240 --> 17:44.720
a significance in that date for the release of the game.

17:44.720 --> 17:49.860
I know, it sounds more like somebody's little fantasy than reality news, but who knows?

17:49.860 --> 17:56.280
That's coming from a fairly reputable source, so we shall see!

17:56.280 --> 17:58.160
I think it's an early April show.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.280
I remembered hearing that the official release date was sometime in early January, so that's

18:02.280 --> 18:03.280
what I'm going to stay with.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.040
That's my story and I'm sticking to it, right?

18:05.040 --> 18:10.240
Until I see, otherwise, something maybe in Naoki's journal or something, which doesn't

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
exist anymore?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Nope, it's gone.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Good!

18:13.240 --> 18:16.240
But we lost our favorite joke. Maybe we should start one.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.240
We should do a journal on behalf of Naoki.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.240
Yeah. You know, I've got an extra live journal code.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.240
The lost deep thoughts of Naoki.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.240
I'll do that. I'll set that up.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.240
Alright, let's do it. We'll make a Naoki live journal or something.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.240
Now don't go getting ideas and taking the name before we can get to it or we'll kick your ass.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.240
Yeah, that's ours. I'll set you on fire.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.240
We claim it. Dibs!

18:39.240 --> 18:44.000
I'm not cold anymore, am I?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
You're not cold anymore?

18:45.000 --> 18:50.080
Well, that's because we've got the lights in here that make everything hot.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.440
I went shopping this week.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.440
What'd you buy?

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
Oh!

18:54.440 --> 18:56.160
You've got a present for Jamie, don't you?

18:56.160 --> 18:57.720
I bought Christmas gifts.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.720
Let's have Jamie open her Christmas present live on air.

18:59.720 --> 19:00.720
This will be fun.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.560
Let's play some Christmas Eve music to celebrate.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.360
You can't open it until I play music.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.720
Now that I've got bills paid, I can go out and buy the rest of the presents that I need

19:11.720 --> 19:12.720
to.

19:12.720 --> 19:17.360
Yeah, it's kind of scary when you get down to $200 on your bank account and you've got

19:17.360 --> 19:18.360
bills due.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.360
Ah!

19:19.360 --> 19:23.760
There we go, some nice Christmas music for you to be opening presents to.

19:23.760 --> 19:28.560
God damn, what'd you tape this with?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
Use packing tape.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
Dark tape.

19:30.560 --> 19:36.560
It looks like me. Oh my god!

19:36.560 --> 19:39.560
You're quite the stooge, aren't you?

19:39.560 --> 19:42.560
I am going to be in Allelukmen Heaven.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.560
I have Quigley Down Under,

19:46.560 --> 19:49.560
Die Hard,

19:49.560 --> 19:51.560
Galaxy Quest,

19:51.560 --> 19:53.560
Robin Hood Princess Thieves,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.560
and Dogma Special Edition.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.560
I'm a happy girl.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.560
I've been drooled for hours.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.560
Would you like to explain the Alan Rickman fetish to anybody that's new to our show?

20:03.560 --> 20:08.560
He's hot, and I don't care how old he is, I love him.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.560
I didn't know he was in Quigley Down Under. Wasn't this movie, like, really bad?

20:12.560 --> 20:15.560
I don't know. I think that Tom Selleck is.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.560
Yeah, but, like, ever since Magnum P.I., Tom Selleck, like, sucks.

20:19.560 --> 20:24.560
There's a few I missed, though. Like, blow dry. I couldn't find that one.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.560
That's okay. Something tells me Jamie's gonna be busy for a little while.

20:27.560 --> 20:33.960
what I just picked up on laserdisc was a sense of sensibility if that isn't a

20:33.960 --> 20:37.600
foofy chick flick I don't know what is

20:42.720 --> 20:49.640
very cool Oh feeling the love here on orange launch radio I'm getting I'm

20:49.640 --> 20:52.240
getting such great use out of my game too I love that thing more than anything

20:52.240 --> 20:55.520
I play fantasy star online now I've went out and bought fantasy star online and

20:55.520 --> 21:01.900
game just takes so much ass. I'm just trying to get some DDR people going in on that. There's

21:01.900 --> 21:07.140
a little thread over on DDR Freak if you check the other games forum. There's a whole little

21:07.140 --> 21:10.140
thread on Phantasy Star Online, so you should check that out because they're trying to form

21:10.140 --> 21:23.380
a block and ship. Christmas is neat. We'll be doing a special

21:23.380 --> 21:28.860
holiday episode next week on the 22nd actually be our year-end wrap-up too by

21:28.860 --> 21:31.700
the way because we're not going to be doing actually I don't know I guess we

21:31.700 --> 21:34.380
could do a show on the 29th it looks like my SoCal trip at the end of the

21:34.380 --> 21:37.580
month may not happen I don't know yet it's a it's still a possibility up in

21:37.580 --> 21:41.380
the air at this point so we shall see but I think either way we agreed we want

21:41.380 --> 21:51.060
to tape that show why not we've got partying to do that's right yeah it's

22:21.060 --> 22:24.540
yesterday. No, it was Friday night that we did the Fuck Off Show. We did a little Fuck

22:24.540 --> 22:29.420
Off Show and then we decided to go to Rocky last night with another friend of ours, Neil

22:29.420 --> 22:37.020
Bugd, who gives the web space, by the way. He is my Sky.cx webmaster. We all decided

22:37.020 --> 22:41.140
to go to Rocky in the Bay Area because we don't have it here in SAC anymore. And we

22:41.140 --> 22:44.080
had fun. It was the second week in a row, actually, that I'd been because we all went

22:44.080 --> 22:48.900
the week before with Jabberwocky. It was fun. Good times. But we don't get out of there

22:48.900 --> 22:54.180
until damn near three in the morning and then we had to go looking for diesel

22:54.180 --> 22:57.980
because Neil's car runs off of diesel fuel he has one of those no he has a

22:57.980 --> 23:01.080
Jetta but it's one of those special ones that runs off of diesel fuel so we had

23:01.080 --> 23:05.120
to drive for like 45 minutes to find a place open 24 hours at diesel finally

23:05.120 --> 23:10.120
found one and then we stopped at Denny's on the way back and Jabberwocky got into

23:10.120 --> 23:13.660
an argument with a waitress over covered and smothered well it wasn't really an

23:13.660 --> 23:24.260
argument it was more of a discussion not really this is crap you went to bed what

23:24.260 --> 23:32.700
time did you go to bed three stayed up I stayed up looking for I think it was

23:32.700 --> 23:37.620
Friday night I stayed up looking for this one picture that I could not find

23:37.620 --> 23:43.540
is from for anyone who's seen Chamber of Secrets it was the scene with a snake

23:43.540 --> 23:50.000
dueling and I wanted to find him dueling and I couldn't find it until like 4 30

23:50.000 --> 23:56.020
a.m. I found it I did a post at the time that I found it and I finally finished

23:56.020 --> 24:00.560
my new icon set but that was on your own your own personal live journal

24:00.560 --> 24:03.760
which if you want to know what it is and go to the orange lounge community yes go to the

24:03.760 --> 24:07.480
orange lounge live journal and look on the friends list there and they'll find me

24:07.480 --> 24:12.840
I did a post on there about something that we're gonna play on the show tonight

24:12.840 --> 24:15.840
for all the Animal Crossing addicts.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.840
Do you want to give an Animal Crossing update? What's new in the world of Animal Crossing?

24:19.840 --> 24:22.840
I want Olivia back.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.840
We hung a sign out front of her house that calls her a bitch, because she is a bitch.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.840
Ooh, we have a visitor! Hooray, doorbell!

24:28.840 --> 24:31.840
Who's going to walk through the door?

24:31.840 --> 24:38.840
For anyone who plays Animal Crossing, I'm sure you all go talk to KK, or Toto KK, as his name is.

24:38.840 --> 24:43.200
And you can get a song from him, and he sings a little song and plays his little guitar,

24:43.200 --> 24:47.680
so I have one of his songs that, uh, I won't tell you what it is until right before we

24:47.680 --> 24:49.860
play it, unless you feel like playing it.

24:49.860 --> 24:54.800
We will go to break very soon and we'll play that, and, uh, this break's gonna be interesting

24:54.800 --> 24:56.240
because I'm actually gonna leave.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.440
Yeah, we're kicking Rob out, we're making him get us food.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.600
I'm gonna be gone for a little bit in the show.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.100
We're making him get us, uh, caffeine.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.480
You know what we'll do, though?

25:03.480 --> 25:08.080
We'll let Dave live out a little fantasy of his, and we'll let him sit in the chair.

25:08.080 --> 25:13.560
uh... but i don't know that they've got to sit on the floor of the city is on

25:13.560 --> 25:15.600
the floor but he is in the chair

25:15.600 --> 25:17.120
here is that the chair

25:17.120 --> 25:19.140
fine and it is a terrorist

25:19.140 --> 25:21.560
because this is this year

25:21.560 --> 25:23.440

25:23.440 --> 25:25.160

25:25.160 --> 25:26.900

25:29.500 --> 25:32.040

25:32.040 --> 25:33.900

25:33.900 --> 25:35.720
we want to tell you did look at it

25:35.720 --> 25:37.560
Saturday sucked ass.

25:37.560 --> 25:38.560
Why?

25:38.560 --> 25:42.160
Well Friday was cool because I went to Golf Land and everyone was there and it was like

25:42.160 --> 25:43.800
we happy good time.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.600
I know but everyone that normally goes there is there.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
And then...

25:48.600 --> 25:51.040
What I said is I wasn't there so it didn't count.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.040
Yeah.

25:52.040 --> 25:57.160
And so then that was cool and I said well Saturday is probably going to be the same

25:57.160 --> 25:59.360
because everyone goes that day too.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.900
And I went there and Will and Cedric were there for a little bit and then they left

26:02.900 --> 26:04.320
and I was all alone.

26:04.320 --> 26:08.240
I played so much in initial D. All by yourself!

26:08.240 --> 26:12.200
I was dancing all alone, voodoo!

26:12.200 --> 26:17.100
Were you dancing all alone in a kimono?

26:17.100 --> 26:21.220
Yes, in the middle of Golf Land.

26:21.220 --> 26:24.580
I actually did the nicest thing I've ever done in DDR.

26:24.580 --> 26:28.540
Some guy offered to pay, you know, to see me play. He's like, oh you're so good!

26:28.540 --> 26:31.660
Wow! You know how that happens sometimes. Was he hitting on you?

26:31.660 --> 26:35.140
No, he was like 50 with his family, and he was like, oh, you have to see this guy.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.540
I don't mean nothing. I was like, no, I'll pay for it, it's okay.

26:38.540 --> 26:41.820
I did that, and I was like, wow. I'm so nice.

26:41.820 --> 26:47.660
Wait, so like, you're nice because somebody gave you money to dance?

26:47.660 --> 26:51.700
Dance, monkey, dance! No, but see, I didn't accept the money.

26:51.700 --> 26:55.100
And I was like, damn, I'm so nice, and I'm so modest.

26:55.100 --> 27:00.420
The last time somebody offered me tokens like that, I took them.

27:00.420 --> 27:02.920
What in the hell is our chat room doing right now?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.420
They're just typing dots.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.420
They're on drugs.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.420
I'm gonna kick the next person who types dots.

27:07.420 --> 27:08.420
Let's see.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.420
It's twin.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.420
Oh, it's twin.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.420
Yay.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.420
Kick him.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.420
But see, it takes them a while to get it.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.420
Uh oh.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.420
There's 23rd Megas.

27:16.420 --> 27:19.420
We're having a kick fest.

27:19.420 --> 27:23.420
But see, it's funny because the lag.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.420
Yeah, I know.

27:24.420 --> 27:26.420
The lag didn't know.

27:26.420 --> 27:29.420
So they didn't even know about it.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.420
Oh, he did it again.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.420
See, that's just...

27:33.420 --> 27:36.420
Oh, no, Joe Mama's playing cop for me. That's good.

27:36.420 --> 27:42.420

27:42.420 --> 27:51.420

28:00.620 --> 28:04.340

28:04.340 --> 28:09.940
Speaking of happy crack I need Twinkies. Speaking of happy crack I'm going to make a run right now so

28:09.940 --> 28:11.060
we're going to take a quick break

28:11.060 --> 28:15.820
we'll be back and when we come back I'm not gonna be here so you'll get your sim

28:15.820 --> 28:16.420
update

28:16.420 --> 28:20.260
and who knows what's gonna happen while I'm not here. I don't know I'm scared.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.420
During this break though we are going to give everyone a little

28:23.420 --> 28:24.820
the taste of Animal Crossing.

28:24.820 --> 28:29.340
Yes, we will have you intro that in just one moment.

28:29.340 --> 28:32.780
We come back and then you're going to do your Sim update, correct?

28:32.780 --> 28:33.780
Yes.

28:33.780 --> 28:38.020
And then you'll talk about your Trinity Mix 3 troubles and you guys will basically own

28:38.020 --> 28:41.020
this show.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.700
Well then, while Rob's pulling up the song, I'll go ahead and...

28:43.700 --> 28:44.700
Yes, please talk about the song.

28:44.700 --> 28:50.580
This particular one is the Eurobeat piece that's in Animal Crossing.

28:50.580 --> 28:57.820
as long as DJ KK, if ever you're interested in pulling it up.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.540
And go ahead and give a listen.

29:00.540 --> 29:03.620
This is actually the one with him singing it, so enjoy.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.100
And also during this break, we'll

29:05.100 --> 29:07.220
play one more track from the Good Cool CD

29:07.220 --> 29:08.760
and some other random crap.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.260
Enjoy.

30:10.260 --> 30:34.100
Me, me, quit quit, oh oh oh, quit quit, me oh me me, oh oh me oh, me me, quit quit, oh

31:04.100 --> 31:31.600
Oh, what a group! Oh, what a group!

31:31.600 --> 31:35.600
A groove, groove, groove like this makes your body move, move, move

31:35.600 --> 31:39.600
You got to feel the music, feel the way it flows

31:39.600 --> 31:43.600
Feel the vibrations from your head down to your toes

32:09.600 --> 32:24.720
Do you remember the time that I need you?

32:24.720 --> 32:32.520
I know you know everything that you do Do you remember the time that I want you?

32:32.520 --> 32:36.120
But you throw me on the floor and you're my love

32:36.120 --> 32:38.240
So you, you have had a bad day

32:38.240 --> 32:40.640
So I'll wait to my peace, yeah

32:40.640 --> 32:41.800
You have had a ball

32:41.800 --> 32:44.480

32:44.480 --> 32:45.680
You have had a bad day

32:45.680 --> 32:48.320
And I can't watch me anymore

32:48.320 --> 32:49.640
You have had a ball

32:49.640 --> 32:51.160
I lay on my knees

32:51.160 --> 32:54.160
Call me son

33:07.160 --> 33:09.160
You have got it now

33:09.160 --> 33:11.160
Go away to my place

33:11.160 --> 33:12.160
You have got it now

33:12.160 --> 33:15.160
I want you telling me

33:15.160 --> 33:16.160
You have got it now

33:16.160 --> 33:19.160
I can't care what you even say

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
You have got it now

33:20.160 --> 33:24.660
A little night, it's a golden sun

33:38.160 --> 33:40.660
Every night

33:41.660 --> 33:44.660
I hear your voice

33:45.660 --> 33:48.660
Every night

34:18.660 --> 34:20.660
We will be here.

34:20.660 --> 34:22.660
Thank you!

34:22.660 --> 34:24.660
Oh my god!

34:24.660 --> 34:26.660
What am I to do?

34:26.660 --> 34:28.660
I want to know what you are doing!

34:28.660 --> 34:30.660
We will play a show for the next time.

34:30.660 --> 34:32.660
Yes!

34:32.660 --> 34:34.660
Ha! Ha! Ha!

34:34.660 --> 34:36.660

35:44.040 --> 35:45.360

Say things that don't rock so well C'mon bro, let me ring your bell

35:48.840 --> 35:52.480
Still love to fight you with a bird of desire All alone and I'm packed in a bowl

You gotta feel the pain if you wanna gain

35:55.960 --> 35:59.480
Dance, with the bump you get loose I hit the floor directly to the roof

35:59.480 --> 36:02.960
You can't jump when the beat gets drunk Dance, burning like the rising sun

36:02.960 --> 36:06.560
Cool, kick the nation with the groove Then we rock the place when the bitch gets moved

36:06.560 --> 36:10.160

All alone and I'm back to the ball You gotta feel the pain if you're on a game

36:59.680 --> 37:03.160
Work that body, work that body Make sure you don't hurt nobody

37:03.160 --> 37:06.680
Girl, be my lady Come on girl, I wanna rock your baby

37:06.680 --> 37:10.440
Yeah, beautiful for that big, thin, big, big wig.

37:15.180 --> 37:20.100
Step by the orange paths, this GDR sucks.

37:20.100 --> 37:20.600
Holler!

37:20.600 --> 37:21.100
Holler!

37:21.100 --> 37:21.600
Holler!

37:21.600 --> 37:22.600
Stup, stup, stup, Stup, hooray!

37:22.600 --> 37:23.100
Stup, hooray!

37:23.100 --> 37:25.580
Stup, stup, stup, stup, hooray!

37:25.580 --> 37:26.080
DTPO.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.580
Hey, we're back and stuff.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.700
I have the chair.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.500
Yay.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.580
Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! Cheer!

37:38.580 --> 37:43.460
That's old. That's like AI 2000. And I have nothing.

37:43.460 --> 37:46.980
Yay. Damn, you suck. I do.

37:46.980 --> 37:51.060
I love that scarf. That's so cool. Dude, he's checking out my scarf. I can

37:51.060 --> 37:54.540
get you a Ravenclaw one, if you want.

37:54.540 --> 37:58.380
Rob didn't leave fast enough so we had to kill him. It has a birthday present. I buried his body.

37:58.380 --> 38:02.140
Well, I didn't really bury it yet. No, Rob's getting me chocolate so I'm happy.

38:02.140 --> 38:04.640
and then we're getting boba later

38:04.640 --> 38:09.020
we're going to tapioca express afterwards

38:09.020 --> 38:12.880
play the max 2 that's been recently installed, hey that's local news

38:12.880 --> 38:17.580
there's the max 2 supposedly has been upgraded over at uh...

38:17.580 --> 38:21.620
tapioca express in davis so uh... we're gonna go check out that action

38:21.620 --> 38:23.180
how far away is that?

38:23.180 --> 38:25.740
it's like thirty minute drive from here

38:25.740 --> 38:26.460
something like that

38:26.460 --> 38:27.680
not too far away

38:27.680 --> 38:30.860
anyway we need our um... our update, our sim update thingy

39:00.860 --> 39:14.860
Next week is going to be the official judging of it and then you'll see on the 22nd actual submissions come online for you to check out.

39:14.860 --> 39:18.020
So look for that.

39:18.020 --> 39:21.180
Aside from that, not too much going on.

39:21.180 --> 39:24.740
They finished the PowerPower graphics for StepMania, so

39:24.740 --> 39:28.220
you'll see that in the new update probably soon.

39:28.220 --> 39:30.940
And DWI haven't really been paying attention to what kind

39:30.940 --> 39:34.420
of updates are going on there, so no big deal.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.500
DDR UK finally finished updating all

39:36.500 --> 39:38.100
their booster packs.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.660
So you've got full sets of pretty much all the official

39:40.660 --> 39:43.380
files with the official graphics for the most part.

39:43.380 --> 39:47.560
And so go check those out for sure.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.940
And aside from that, not too much else.

39:50.940 --> 39:55.580
Just more files on DDR Maniacs, so go check those out.

39:55.580 --> 39:56.460
Some pretty cool ones.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.700
And I'm redoing my entire site.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.700
Well, not my entire site, but the download section of it.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.860
I'm sorting them all into 2DX-style categories.

40:06.860 --> 40:09.460
And I'm actually going to be doing a mass upload of a bunch

40:09.460 --> 40:11.540
of different files, so you'll see a bunch of

40:11.540 --> 40:12.740
those coming soon.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.860
brain only have a few of them that

40:15.860 --> 40:17.660
is trained

40:17.660 --> 40:19.280
uh... what

40:19.280 --> 40:21.100
okay

40:21.100 --> 40:21.900

40:23.900 --> 40:25.500

40:38.060 --> 40:40.820
of course you know kids deadline for my uh...

40:40.820 --> 40:46.300
Make Edit Get Porn Contest, if I remember correctly, is next Sunday.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.660
Get your edits in, if you haven't yet.

40:48.660 --> 40:54.660
Dave has entered, and if no one else enters, he will sweep the whole competition.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.820
Has anyone else entered yet?

40:57.820 --> 41:01.140
I will win, and all the porn will be mine!

41:01.140 --> 41:04.060
I'll enter. Why not?

41:04.060 --> 41:05.460
I want porn.

41:05.460 --> 41:08.660
I want man porn, but I want porn.

41:08.660 --> 41:12.660
If I get boob porn, then I can give it to people.

41:12.660 --> 41:15.660
Dave, you don't get any porn.

41:15.660 --> 41:16.660
Sorry, Dave.

41:16.660 --> 41:18.660
No porn for you.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.660
No porn for you!

41:20.660 --> 41:21.660
I'm not entering for the porn.

41:21.660 --> 41:23.660
I'm entering for the recognition of women.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.660
No, you can't have the chair back.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.660
The porn is a bonus.

41:26.660 --> 41:29.660
Holy crap, that was fast.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.660
Where's my cupcakes?

41:31.660 --> 41:36.660
I would have been back before the break was even finished if that stupid bitch in front

41:36.660 --> 41:41.380
bitch in front of me in line, knew how to use her goddamn ATM card in the little slider.

41:41.380 --> 41:42.900
My preemptive F.U. of the week?

41:42.900 --> 41:45.140
No, you need to save it for the F.U.s of the week.

41:45.140 --> 41:47.620
Ugh, fine, I'll save it, but, oh man, what a bitch.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.180
Maybe we should just do the F.U.s of the week.

41:49.180 --> 41:50.740
Well, we gotta wait for the chat room to submit theirs.

41:50.740 --> 41:51.740
We gotta give them time to send theirs.

41:51.740 --> 41:54.660
You wanna do the F.U.s of the week right now?

41:54.660 --> 41:56.980
We can do them in a minute, but Matt's still finishing his-

41:56.980 --> 41:57.980
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

41:57.980 --> 41:58.980
Well, okay, chat room-

41:58.980 --> 41:59.980
Yeah, Rob!

41:59.980 --> 42:02.140
Chat room, send me your F.U.s of the week over private message, or send them to Jamie's name

42:02.140 --> 42:03.860
right now so uh...

42:03.860 --> 42:07.820
what is actually ok at change it back to sky ok child semi refuse a week sky and

42:07.820 --> 42:09.900
we'll get to those right after lucky finishes by

yeah uh... that i get a chair again

42:12.640 --> 42:16.100
okay i guess i get the floor again

42:16.100 --> 42:19.180

42:19.180 --> 42:21.080
go for it

42:21.080 --> 42:22.840

42:22.840 --> 42:25.980
uh... yeah so you'll probably see some more stuff on there i know for a fact

42:25.980 --> 42:28.480
that i'm gonna have alien world uh...

42:28.480 --> 42:32.580
the D.W.I. for that coming up on my site. Also, I'm supposed to be getting some D.W.I.s

42:32.580 --> 42:38.460
for Starry Eyes Surprise and a few other songs. So you'll be seeing those also hosted on my

42:38.460 --> 42:47.700
site. So just check for that and that's it. And we're ready to go. Whoa, food! I got food.

42:47.700 --> 42:53.220
Dude, this is awesome. Rob came back with chocolate cupcakes for me and now my scarf

42:53.220 --> 42:57.140
is being worn by Dave. But you're not Slytherin, yo.

42:57.140 --> 42:59.340
and guess what i brought back for dave

42:59.340 --> 43:02.640
nothing

43:02.640 --> 43:03.320
yeah

43:03.320 --> 43:05.660
in this country i don't need anything

43:05.660 --> 43:09.500
i'm content with sitting here on the floor in my scarf

43:09.500 --> 43:12.200
that matches my sweatshirt

43:12.200 --> 43:13.300
yeah

43:13.300 --> 43:15.740
you're you're one of those boring or even call

43:15.740 --> 43:17.060
written quite tight

43:17.060 --> 43:19.300
and i think they're staying with one

43:19.300 --> 43:21.900
if you can correct

43:21.900 --> 43:23.260
now in harry potter talk

43:23.260 --> 43:25.260
They'd better have a hot person play her.

43:25.260 --> 43:28.260
Dude, Rob got fluffy balls.

43:28.260 --> 43:30.260
Oh, oh, oh.

43:30.260 --> 43:33.260
Propell, because Propell is the drink of the gods.

43:33.260 --> 43:36.260
I've only had it once, and that was when I had some of yours.

43:36.260 --> 43:37.260
Do you want some Propell?

43:37.260 --> 43:38.260
Okay.

43:38.260 --> 43:39.260
No.

43:39.260 --> 43:42.260
Everyone's being mean to me tonight.

43:42.260 --> 43:44.260
Here, have my other bottle of Propell.

43:44.260 --> 43:46.260
Okay, anyway.

43:46.260 --> 43:49.260
One thing that somebody in the chat room wanted to mention in your sim update,

43:49.260 --> 43:51.260
I believe this was sent to me by Twen.

43:51.260 --> 43:55.260
Feet of Fury got an update to it, and this is really interesting.

43:55.260 --> 43:59.260
Actually, no update has been released, but there was some news on it.

43:59.260 --> 44:04.260
So let me see if I can load up that news. I've got to go to one of my websites here so I can get the quote on that.

44:04.260 --> 44:08.260
Because this is going to be interesting. This is something that begs being talked about here before we get into the FUs of the week.

44:08.260 --> 44:10.260
It's begging with a cup and everything.

44:10.260 --> 44:15.260
Yes, it's begging for your dollars. Literally, it's begging for a dollar.

44:15.260 --> 44:20.500
Okay, so this is what the latest update was posted over at cagames.com, I believe is the

44:20.500 --> 44:21.500
site correct?

44:21.500 --> 44:22.500
Yes, cagames.com.

44:22.500 --> 44:25.100
These are the folks that make Feet of Fury.

44:25.100 --> 44:28.500
This is a DDR emulator for the Dreamcast, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago

44:28.500 --> 44:30.020
on the big program.

44:30.020 --> 44:33.620
And I think our consensus was most of the people didn't particularly care for it.

44:33.620 --> 44:37.780
I thought for a first mix it was okay, but it had a long way to go.

44:37.780 --> 44:41.700
But most people here didn't care for it, DDR has kind of surpassed that right now, but

44:41.700 --> 44:42.700
I don't know.

44:42.700 --> 44:45.700
I think the Homebrew Dreamcast stuff is just cool to begin with.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.700
But you need to play some good songs.

44:47.700 --> 44:51.700
It's like trying to play SSR on Happy Craft because everything is flat.

44:51.700 --> 44:55.700
And I'm being corrected, it's not an emulator, it's a simulator.

44:55.700 --> 44:58.700
Get over it, I don't care, same thing.

44:58.700 --> 45:00.700
Okay, it's not the same thing.

45:00.700 --> 45:02.700
It's getting to play DDR for free, that's what it is.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.700
It all comes down to the same thing.

45:04.700 --> 45:07.700
Anyway, the news update says this.

45:07.700 --> 45:11.220
Been a while since I posted some news, but two quick items.

45:11.220 --> 45:14.860
They got the results back from IGF and they didn't get into the finals.

45:14.860 --> 45:17.460
I don't know what that is.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.980
Very surprising considering the bend of the contest is still disappointing.

45:19.980 --> 45:23.900
I guess it was some kind of homemade games thing.

45:23.900 --> 45:27.300
The second thing is that they're going to do a final release of Feed a Fury.

45:27.300 --> 45:30.060
They're going to do it in March of 2003.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.860
They've been doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

45:31.860 --> 45:35.700
They haven't had time to really finish the game, so they're going to do it then.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.820
The bigger news is that the finished Feed a Fury game will be sold rather than posted

45:39.820 --> 45:40.820
online.

45:40.820 --> 45:44.380
They may do another preview version at that time with more bug fixes, better hardware

45:44.380 --> 45:49.340
support, better swap CD options, but if you get the real press CD, the sold one, you're

45:49.340 --> 45:54.820
going to be treated to a lot more songs, more gameplay modes, and etc.

45:54.820 --> 46:02.380
So I think they're begging to get a lawsuit, I agree.

46:02.380 --> 46:06.060
I don't know, unless it's radically different from DDR, they might be in some trouble for

46:06.060 --> 46:07.060
doing that.

46:07.060 --> 46:12.020
Then again, Pump It Up survived this whole time, who knows.

46:12.020 --> 46:16.420
There's also all the other clones out there that no one hears about that lurk around on

46:16.420 --> 46:18.420
eBay.

46:18.420 --> 46:21.360
There's Technomotion, Easy to Dancer.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.980
They're not trying to sell StepMania.

46:24.980 --> 46:30.800
I mean, Pump It Up at least had different notes, this is still up, down, left, right.

46:30.800 --> 46:35.480
thing. Well, okay, remember though, Feed a Fury, the first thing it was didn't even

46:35.480 --> 46:39.560
have normal DDR mode. All it was was a Dance Magic-like mode, which had

46:39.560 --> 46:43.800
different things, and it looked different, but I mean, at its concept, if Konami

46:43.800 --> 46:47.040
wanted to proceed with, you know, trying to get something against them, it probably

46:47.040 --> 46:51.720
could do it, because it is very similar to Dance Magic, which was in Disney's

46:51.720 --> 46:57.040
Disney's Mix that they released here in the U.S. already. Let's hear it for Disney's Rave.

46:57.040 --> 47:09.200
in the u.s. it's mix happen to have Disney's right I know I know yes

47:09.200 --> 47:12.680
regardless of whether they're gonna get busted or not we will be looking forward

47:12.680 --> 47:18.040
to that release we will I'm sure get a copy of a feet of fury and talk about

47:18.040 --> 47:23.920
Rob will we will not the rest of us are not going to get it I will stay on top

47:23.920 --> 47:25.920
Are you going to get it now?

47:25.920 --> 47:28.920
Maybe, because I don't use my Dreamcast for anything.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.920
I use my Dreamcast to play Rainbow Cotton.

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
You know what I use my Dreamcast for?

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
Paperweight?

47:33.920 --> 47:35.920
No, I use it to play Nintendo games.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.920
For Nestor DC, that's all I use my Dreamcast for.

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
All in Soul Calibur.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
I play Plio Da.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
Plio Da is cool.

47:40.920 --> 47:44.920
Plio Da is awesome.

47:44.920 --> 47:47.920
Well, I had some questions in the chat room and wanted me to ask the Loki about this,

47:47.920 --> 47:48.920
if you've seen this.

47:48.920 --> 47:49.920
Actually, all of us, really.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.920
The Flash Flash Revolution.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
Have you seen that?

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
What do you think?

47:53.920 --> 47:59.120
I don't like flash games, especially in dial-up.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.880
Flash games all suck, and the same with the DDR.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.920
I played it, and I was like, eh, whatever.

48:03.920 --> 48:06.560
It took forever to load, and it wasn't that impressive.

48:06.560 --> 48:14.600
Okay, I mean, I saw it, and it was basically like, there's nothing special about it, it's

48:14.600 --> 48:22.840
just downloaded choppy DDR emulator, simulator, whatever it's called.

48:22.840 --> 48:29.340
It has less songs, less variety than something like Stylania, so I don't see why you would play that.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.340
Is that like that Delight Delight reduplication? That old, older account?

48:32.340 --> 48:39.340
No, no, it's just like you download the song, or you go to the site and click on the flash game.

48:39.340 --> 48:42.340
Have you ever played different little flash games or whatever? It's just like that.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.840
And then the notes scroll up the screen and you have to hit the arrows at the same time.

48:44.840 --> 48:48.840
Well, if you guys want to be really cool, you can go back to DDR99.

48:48.840 --> 48:55.840
If anyone ever remembers that with the MSD files, they actually have a plugin for Winamp they can get for that.

48:55.840 --> 49:01.840
That was like, I don't know, a couple years ago. So go check that out if you really want to play this stupid Flash crap.

49:01.840 --> 49:04.840
I mean, there's nothing really special about it.

49:04.840 --> 49:06.840
You could play Dance Dance Karnov.

49:06.840 --> 49:11.840
And it's really choppy, and I don't think it was synced too well. So, no.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.840
How many people remember Dance Dance Karnov?

49:14.840 --> 49:16.840
I have it.

49:16.840 --> 49:23.440
was an old Nintendo game that really sucked and so they did like a DDR flash simulator

49:23.440 --> 49:29.720
with Karnov. Yeah, but do you know it's cool? Last week I saw DDR on the graphic calculator

49:29.720 --> 49:33.680
which I had never seen before. Okay, that's like really retarded. That's the funniest

49:33.680 --> 49:37.420
thing I've heard in my entire life. You know it was funny though. At least with pole position

49:37.420 --> 49:41.720
you could like play it and it hadn't made sense, but DDR, no music, hello, what's he

49:41.720 --> 49:45.940
going to do, click at you? DDR, no music, no flashing, just the arrow, scroll up the

49:45.940 --> 49:50.460
the screen. There's one BPM for all four songs. It's just the notes on basic.

49:50.460 --> 49:56.060
Actually, you're incorrect. You can do sound with the calculator, but you have to build

49:56.060 --> 49:58.780
your own speakers. I have a message. I have a message for the

49:58.780 --> 50:02.380
person that created DDR for the graphing calculator. Nerd.

50:02.380 --> 50:08.540
Get a life. Get a fucking life. Go outdoors. Smell a flower or something. Get a girlfriend,

50:08.540 --> 50:10.420
a boyfriend who cares

50:10.420 --> 50:13.260
go out and get laid

50:13.260 --> 50:16.260
something that borden calculus

50:16.260 --> 50:21.260
say jesus

50:21.260 --> 50:25.460
although yes secretly all that yes kind of cool

50:25.460 --> 50:27.220
i hope the god that didn't leave

50:27.220 --> 50:30.060
that window on when i left

50:30.060 --> 50:32.060
you know i i i think i think i think

50:32.060 --> 50:33.220
at least aces

50:33.220 --> 50:35.100
otherwise they're all my good

50:35.100 --> 50:37.420
okay i'm not even say just in case

50:37.420 --> 50:43.420
I used to sit in chemistry class and play pole position on a graphic calculator. That was cool.

50:43.420 --> 50:48.420
I used to sit there in calculus and copy all the formulas that we were supposed to memorize for the test onto the calculator.

50:48.420 --> 50:55.420
I had them memorized anyway. To this day, I still remember that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.420
That is astonishing.

50:57.420 --> 50:58.420
6.022.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.420
Astonishing.

50:59.420 --> 51:00.420
Oh yeah.

51:00.420 --> 51:01.420
They've been talking in the chat room.

51:01.420 --> 51:04.420
It has come up lately, but when I was in school we learned it was just 6.02.

51:04.420 --> 51:09.740
When we were talking about Flash Flash Revolution, somebody brought up Black Lab Invoke This,

51:09.740 --> 51:13.060
he said, Flash ruined the internet. Which kind of goes back to what we were talking

51:13.060 --> 51:16.660
about a couple nights ago on the Fuck Off show. What ruined the internet?

51:16.660 --> 51:22.220
Actually, actually, I was just... Papa Bats ruined the internet, yes.

51:22.220 --> 51:29.260
I posted some links actually on our website about stupid knockoff DDR things that someone

51:29.260 --> 51:34.380
actually came up with a full-body like DDR thing with sent motion-captured

51:34.380 --> 51:43.120
sensors on his body to for like DDR is called they're making obscene shapes out

51:43.120 --> 51:45.920
of pretzels they've got boobs and penises just ignore him Loki continue

51:45.920 --> 51:56.260
hit you I don't get it it's looks what it's a pretzel yeah anyway so basically

51:56.260 --> 52:02.800
It's like almost if you cross DDR with like say, I don't actually it was more like a Samba de Amigo

52:03.940 --> 52:05.260
It was very much like that

52:05.260 --> 52:10.520
You know how you have to strike poses and stuff with that pretty much like that you have the match poses that thing did so

52:10.520 --> 52:12.300
It's like a music game

52:12.300 --> 52:17.620
Like that that someone is supposed to develop also. I read there's another thing. I found that someone's developing a

52:18.940 --> 52:21.300
DDR sim for ps2 Linux

52:21.300 --> 52:22.300
Nerd!

52:22.300 --> 52:30.060
Dude, now I'm thinking about getting a Linux kit for my PS2.

52:30.060 --> 52:31.060
That's all I have.

52:31.060 --> 52:35.700
Dude, that would be cool, you need to get, the only reason I wanted is to get those things

52:35.700 --> 52:39.060
that people were programming, you know, that's the whole reason I wanted the Gato's A for

52:39.060 --> 52:45.740
the first PlayStation, was so that I could have my friend program me Galaga.

52:45.740 --> 52:50.580
And that was like a version of Galaga that actually was a challenge.

52:50.580 --> 52:56.520
knows I'm an old namco whore sorry konami I've been giving a been given a

52:56.520 --> 52:59.820
flash that we have to play over the internet because it'll make us cool or

52:59.820 --> 53:03.960
something like that if this is it's called spider-man and if this is that

53:03.960 --> 53:08.280
spider-man's gay thing I'm gonna I'm gonna start punching people randomly in

53:08.280 --> 53:11.160
the chat room because that thing's stupid that's right you're getting banned

53:11.160 --> 53:19.760
if this is that stupid spider-man is gay thing we're waiting for yes after this

53:19.760 --> 53:22.200
have used the we're waiting for this to load here

53:22.200 --> 53:24.560
eighty three eighty six eighty eight

53:24.560 --> 53:25.940
right or slow

53:25.940 --> 53:30.740
he shut up i'm doing a show here

53:30.740 --> 53:32.060
what the fuck

53:32.060 --> 53:39.060
it's in a foreign language

53:40.660 --> 53:42.740
i hate you

53:42.740 --> 53:47.120
this is the worst flash i've ever seen

53:47.120 --> 53:51.120
Alright, wait, hold on, hold on. That's getting a kick.

53:51.120 --> 53:55.120
You know what the best Flash was, though, that was along those lines?

53:55.120 --> 53:59.120
It was the Mega Man one where he danced to Twinbee from 2DX.

53:59.120 --> 54:03.120
I just... I kicked EOSFVB for that

54:03.120 --> 54:07.120
worst Flash ever. That was so funny.

54:07.120 --> 54:11.120
Oh, Rob, I actually learned the whole dance now.

54:11.120 --> 54:15.120
I know the whole dance, so you'll have to play that promo when we come back.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.820
all right maybe we will move

54:16.820 --> 54:17.880
okay at least

54:17.880 --> 54:20.560
all right yes let's do the f use of the week

54:20.560 --> 54:22.680

54:22.680 --> 54:25.520
if you want to join our chair by the way just head over to our website orange

54:25.520 --> 54:28.400

54:33.180 --> 54:35.080
yeah i'd like to share is the week

54:35.080 --> 54:39.400
yes tell us what you'd like to fuck i'm going back to the fact that

54:39.400 --> 54:43.760
i'm not going back to the old school slag work this week just because

54:43.760 --> 54:45.240
I'll have a new song after that, by the way.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.280
Ooh, cool.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.880
Okay, here we go.

54:48.880 --> 54:53.520
Okay, my first F.U. of the week is Writer's Block.

54:53.520 --> 54:57.660
Okay, actually, this sort of links back to my old one about my hard drive.

54:57.660 --> 55:02.320
For people who don't know, my hard drive died. I mean, completely died. It broke.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.680
And I lost

55:03.680 --> 55:07.880
chapter five... Actually, I lost every fanfic I'd ever written, but really

55:07.880 --> 55:11.640
importantly, I'd lost the fifth chapter of the one I'm currently working on.

55:11.640 --> 55:12.720
I was like

55:12.720 --> 55:16.640
twenty five hundred words into it

55:16.640 --> 55:19.460
which uh... for me that's

55:19.460 --> 55:24.220
a good bit that's actually a third of the fanfic of the chapter right there

55:24.220 --> 55:28.160
the last few chapters I've written ended up topping over six thousand words a piece

55:28.160 --> 55:31.740
uh... marin's in the chat room right now and says you need to write more

55:31.740 --> 55:34.680
yes i'm sorry marin chan

55:34.680 --> 55:37.160
oh my bad marin

55:37.160 --> 55:39.120
uh... who by the way uh...

55:39.120 --> 55:44.880
For anybody who remembers the DVR Freak Moderator strip, she's my friend that I went to lunch

55:44.880 --> 55:47.380
with when we were there and hung out with.

55:47.380 --> 55:50.800
She got to see me incredibly drunk at Star Trek Experience, sorry.

55:50.800 --> 55:55.740
Anyway, on that note, I was really, really pissed off about it and didn't want to write

55:55.740 --> 55:58.040
anything for like a week or so.

55:58.040 --> 56:02.760
And I started writing on it again, and wouldn't you know it, I get started on it, I'm on a

56:02.760 --> 56:05.520
roll, Dan's like, hey, you wanna go get food?

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
Let's go get food.

56:06.520 --> 56:12.760
had some lovely French toast, and then came back, and I couldn't write. I really couldn't

56:12.760 --> 56:17.080
think of anything. I was like, well what the hell can you think of? I had it really dark

56:17.080 --> 56:22.520
before, I mean really, like, disgustingly dark. And um, I decided to take it a little

56:22.520 --> 56:26.520
bit lighter, and do the really dark stuff on the last few chapters, and then I just

56:26.520 --> 56:31.520
blanked. So, that sucks.

56:31.520 --> 56:32.520
That's it? Oh.

56:32.520 --> 56:43.520
If you go to fanfiction.net, look up Dark Sakura, my fanfics there, it's a Digimon fic. Like all my other ones there. And if you read it, leave me reviews. Reviews are special and they make me happy.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.520
Yeah, fuck people who don't leave me reviews because you suck.

56:47.520 --> 57:03.520
Okay, my other question of the week is, well, okay, I can't really blame him for this, but you know, fuck losing my cable, because even though I don't watch TV, I occasionally like the option of watching it, so I can see Buffy.

57:03.520 --> 57:05.520
Iron Chef.

57:05.520 --> 57:12.520
No, we didn't even, I don't even like watching that, but, um, well, I like watching it when I'm with other people that don't know me.

57:42.520 --> 57:46.520
It's not a BuffyCon, it's like a sci-fi con, but I'm gonna go see my man.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.520
Buffy ruined the internet.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.520
No! No pop-ups ruined the internet.

57:52.520 --> 57:55.520
We're gonna do a list list on what ruined the internet. I think maybe that should be our topic for tonight.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.020
Okay.

57:57.020 --> 57:59.520
You wanna do that? Okay, we're gonna do a list list tonight, and that'll be the topic.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.520
What ruined the internet? Alright.

58:03.520 --> 58:05.520
Okay. Um, but uh...

58:06.520 --> 58:07.520
These things are salty.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.520
Buffy's pretzels, but I'll be...

58:09.520 --> 58:14.520
kostjamrh Yeah, that's it. Bob, stop eating your balls.

58:14.520 --> 58:19.520
kostjamrh I like my balls, they're big and fluffy.

58:19.520 --> 58:24.520
kostjamrh I think we need to go to the next F.U.

58:21.520 --> 58:26.520
kostjamrh Lowkey, let's hear from you.

58:25.520 --> 58:30.520
kostjamrh I have no saliva because of these pretzels.

58:28.520 --> 58:33.520
kostjamrh Need Zalavex.

58:29.520 --> 58:34.520
kostjamrh No French kissing for you.

58:32.520 --> 58:37.520
kostjamrh Anyways, ugh.

58:37.520 --> 58:42.360
this weather. It has to be stupid drivers. I hate stupid drivers. I hate stupid drivers

58:42.360 --> 58:46.360
to try to pull out in front of me. I hate stupid drivers to drive 40 miles under the

58:46.360 --> 58:52.160
speed limit. I hate them. They're stupid. Especially this old bitch that was behind

58:52.160 --> 58:58.160
yesterday going down the south watt. She's going 25 miles an hour. There's 20 cars behind

58:58.160 --> 59:04.080
her. I was like, fuck you. So I went around her and everyone honked at her and flipped

59:04.080 --> 59:09.640
off and try to veer off the road, so that doesn't work.

59:09.640 --> 59:13.120
And after you two dial up email.

59:13.120 --> 59:18.800
Fucking A, I have my Turning Mix 3 thing done, and I can't submit it because it's like, no.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.400
I want a time out.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.400
Sorry.

59:21.400 --> 59:26.860
So, I can't, either, one way or another, my stupid file's coming online tonight, you know,

59:26.860 --> 59:31.100
whether it be, you know, in the official judging for Turning Mix 3 or on my website.

59:31.100 --> 59:33.980
One way or another, it's up there.

59:33.980 --> 59:40.980
And yeah, I don't know. I don't have too much to go with right now because I'm happy with

59:40.980 --> 59:44.980
pretzels. So, I'll think of something later, I'm sure.

59:44.980 --> 59:51.980
Alright. In the meantime, my turn. Alright. First of all, F you to the rain. I know it's

59:52.040 --> 59:56.160
needed and all, but fuck, I hate driving in it. It's the worst. It makes everybody drive

59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.380
like an ass, and I have this intense fear of hydroplaning every time I kick up a puddle.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.780
I think I'm going to die. I hate it.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.780
I want a hydroplane. I've never done it before.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.780
No, it sucks. It's awful. Go to hell.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.780
I want a hydroplane, but like when no one else is around so I can like do a 720 and then keep going.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.780
You're a scary man and I hope they never give you a license.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.780
My other F.U. of the week goes to that stupid bitch at Walgreens who didn't know how to use her ATM card thing.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.780
Here's a hint.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:29.780
If you don't know how to use your ATM card to pay for your food, you need to fucking just go get cash and do it that way.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.980
wait god

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.780
i hate people to hold up the line because they're retarded

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.120
get a life

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.620

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.840

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.380
and then

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.580

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.100
to give me sympathy

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.020
because my birthday is the day after christmas

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.260

i'm like no i'm doing this year's weird people hanukkah at a weird time this

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.260

i'm not getting him because it's pretty

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.900
First, you gotta remember about Hanukkah. It's like, what? Christmas? When's that, huh? Did it happen yet? No? Yes?

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.900
Okay. Secondly-

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.900
Oh, Christmas is just that day you don't have to go to school or you get off work randomly.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.900
Christmas is fun because it's the day before my birthday.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:48.900
I get to go skiing because everyone else is going fucking eating, you know, turkey and shit.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.900
Okay. Anyway, my second nephew goes to my stupid fat fucking bitch Spanish teacher.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:01.100
oh my god she must weigh like 500 pounds if you've ever seen the movie herculea is the animated one

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:08.540
like she looks like the titan who's the like the earth titan or whatever there's just a giant blob

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:15.100
of mush except the female version her ankle is bigger than my neck i kid you not and she's so

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:20.940
fat and she speaks in an italian accent the spanish so you can't understand a fucking word

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:26.700
and she's like okay kiddos remember the test today what test what okay project what and then we all

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:32.300
fail i have a d right now and that's keeping me from doing shit that i want to do in my mom's

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:39.100
moment okay i'm done all right let's hear from the chat room then

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:46.060
first i'm going to open up the email bag i'm going to open up the email bag because we have

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:56.500
We have some late FUs from last week. These come from Muhymer, who sent these in last

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.300
week for last week's show, except he must not have been in on Saturday when we were

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.100
actually taping the show. So we sent these in on Sunday and we weren't here. We were

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.900
running a tape. He says as much as he enjoys hearing things that piss Jamie off the whole

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:14.040
show, he needs to contribute his own stuff. So fuck non-individualistic people who are

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.680
too worried of what other people will think of them. Fuck, fuck them. Fuck my so-called

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.560
friends for not going to the movies with me because it was a whole ten minutes out of

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.800
the way. They have a DDR machine there, yay. So I had to go with only two people instead

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.960
of who I wanted to go with. Fuck that DDR machine at the movies because it didn't have

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.240
a good screen quality and it made me look suckier than I really am, which is pretty

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.320
sucky anyway. Fuck Pierce Brosnan for getting to make Sweet Lovin' to Halle Berry instead

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.900
of me. Don't forget that Billy Bob Thornton also got to make Sweet Lovin' to Halle Berry

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:48.600
in that movie and she was all topless and stuff too, Monsters Ball. That movie's fucked

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.680
up though. I've never seen a movie that made me want to kill myself, but Monsters Ball

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.680
just makes you want to die. Don't rent it, it's awful. It's not funny! How is that movie

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.400
funny? It was horrible! Go on Kazaa and just type in Halle Berry naked and just watch the

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:10.400
ten second clip. Don't rent the whole movie. Did she show her titties to die another day

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.320
another day or something

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.400
i think so

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.860
and most of all you know i knew that

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.900
i just found a picture of my man and i'm staring at him and ignoring the naked

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.020
halle's home

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:23.620
you know she went to her parents are better paid all you do it there and

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.280
google alan rickman play my fucking music

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.820
thank you to halle berry for ruining the character of storm and x-men thank you

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.900
fucked up the accent fucked up the whole movie are you saying halle berry ruined

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:36.780
the internet

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.780
No, I'm saying she would go into X-Men.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.780
By the way, the trailer is out for X2.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.780
It's looking to be good, but the bitch is still in it.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.780
So fuck her for existing.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:50.780
Are there snowboarders or extreme sports in that movie?

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.780
A third one, they can just call it Triple X.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.780
Whoa.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.780
I was very disappointed that that movie has no porn in it whatsoever.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.780
What a misleading title.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:05.780
Triple X, you expect, like, you know, booby shot, something like that, but no.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.540
Like the Matt Hoffman's triple X BMX or whatever that's called

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:14.380
I don't know if it's Matt Hoffman or but whatever that one was that one was better than triple X

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.140
I mean fuck propel propel just spit up in my face

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:22.360
It's it's called BMX X X and I got a copy for free on Xbox

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.380
Well, Dan did

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:33.840
I'm sorry, thanks. I'm gonna tell you what ruined x-men. I'm gonna tell you right here. What ruined x-men

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.840
On that note, here, this is what ruined X-Men.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.840
Do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.840
Same thing that happens to everything else.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840
Gosh, he sucks.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.840
Who let that get in the script? That was the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.840
Delivered by the stupidest person.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.840
God!

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.840
It was for all the eight-year-old little kids who watched the little TV show.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.840
And so they can go repeat that line over and over again.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.840
Well, fuck kids.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.840
Fuck kids!

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.840
They'd be like, no!

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Don't fuck kids!

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.840
What happens when lightning hits a tote?

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.240
Well, um, I don't know.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240
Sounded cool, though.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240
No, it was dumb.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.760
If they explode, that's kind of neat.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760
Anyway.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.760
Oh yes, we still have fuck yous.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.760
Yeah.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.680
And now we have Muhimers, this week's fuck yous.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.880
Fuck my swim coaches for being lazy and dumb and whatnot, fuck lame projects, and fuck

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.800
the crazy DDR machine that poor Loki couldn't hack.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
Poor Loki.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.400
And he spells Loki L-O-K-I-E, which I think is really cute.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.680

but not as an a-level

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.500
but

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.040

and the logo of the special fluid logo it's going to happen

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.380
What the fuck AOL?

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:34.380
Can I finish with the chatroom now? No.

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.220
WhackWab

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.780
says uh... my god he's got a lot here

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:44.340
uh... F you. Fuck finals, I hate finals. Fuck the rain for starting on Friday

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:47.300
instead of Saturday because I had to ride my bike in the rain to both my finals

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.300
on Friday.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.620
Fuck the owner of TapXpress for not unlocking the Max 2 machine after it

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.800
was installed. God knows why he didn't do it.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.320
Fuck the 49ers for not winning today. Fuck allergies. Just fuck them.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.680
I missed all my classes this week before finals because I was sick.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.120
And fuck you, Grant.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:08.120
He needs to die so I can move up one rung on my girlfriend's ladder of love.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.000
Wait a minute, why aren't you number one on your girlfriend's ladder of love?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.520
That's fucked up right there.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.740
Why is there a ladder that you need to move up rungs on?

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.080
Do you need a promotion?

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.080
If you're not one, then you should at least be number two or three, I'm thinking.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:31.080
I mean, you sound like you're number eighteen or nineteen right now.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.080
It's bad when they say they need to settle for you.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.080
We're gonna get our butt kicked by Black Lab in about five seconds as soon as the buffer gets to him.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.080
You know what? I have another actress I'd like to say fuck you to.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080
Alrighty.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.080
Linda Fiorentino.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080
Cause she's so sucked in Dogma.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.080
That part was written for Alanis, and Alanis declined it, but then came back and said,

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.080
No, I guess I'll be in the movie, and Kevin Smith said, Oh, well, I have a better part for you anyway, so that's why she's gone.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080
Jeanine Garofalo should have had it.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080
Who, God?

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080
No.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080
Oh, that would have been cool.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080
Jeanine Garofalo should have had it.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080
Oh, that would have been cool.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.080
And they actually went back and said they should have given it to her.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080
But no, Linda Tarantino.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080
Anyway, keep going with Chet Room.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080
Okay, yes.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080

that Halle Berry's tits are shown for ten seconds in Swordfish.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.280
And this is for people who can't get laid.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.240
Actually, only like four or five. Maybe six. Maybe.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:01.120
It's just like, I'm reading a book. Whoa! I don't have clothes on.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.600
That was kind of like, what's-her-name in the Thomas Crown Affair. She's kind of an

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.640
older lady, but she's still, you know, considering her age, she still has some very nice looking

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.840
titties

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.380

resulting in shit getting done on so caltech's

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.340
always not a good thing if you get work done

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:36.400
i think you know like you confused me sir all resulting in jack shit we said

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.920
resulting in shit in the negative fashion I will see I'm sure I'm sure we

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.720
will get a clarification Dave's heads on the floor and I can totally kick him in

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.840
the head now cool DCB says f you to the rain and he wants me to hold off playing

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.240

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.800
strays I wants to send a continued f you to his ex to his parents and the bite

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.360
sized f you to I can't say that because we don't do personal f us on here on top

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.360
Of all the basics, I want to kick out an F.U. to the power in his house. I went over ten, twelve hours yesterday without power.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.360
And by the way, to your last thing, the answer is no.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.360
We put a question mark.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Not just no, but hell no.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.360
He put a question mark. Like, I want to? I don't know.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360
When you decide, let me know and I'll still tell you no.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:50.360
I am not seeing her in the chat room in a long time. She's always idling and somehow gets disconnected.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:02.160
asking to get back together with you

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.840
i'm just laughing as black labs telling up to one of the chat room going please

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.600
go get laid please

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.520
again

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.640
like a daily occurrence anyway

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.160
uh...

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.800
host by the way stresses says it's okay

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.540
he cries and and you laughing at school so

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.040
Oh yeah, I have another F.U. I just remembered now.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.540
No, I just think that Dan would kick his ass.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.540
I have an F.U. to my camera. The camera I just bought.

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.540
Because all the pictures it takes are way too dark. That's it.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.040
I didn't even have time to change music.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.540
Maybe we should give you a flashlight to carry around with it.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.040
It doesn't matter, you can have the sun behind you and it wouldn't matter.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.040
I still got a million F.U.s to get through here.

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.540
Brack2000 says, uh, flash flash, oh whoops.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.040
That was another F.U. for, er, that was a hint for earlier in the show.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.040
FU to EOSFBB for making him hear the catch-up song, and he cried.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.040
I thought my ears were going to bleed.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:03.040
The background song, by the way, is Cheer Train from 2DX7 style, for those that were inquiring.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.040
23rd Magus says, FU to Skrull for delaying his work on his tournaments entry.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.040
It was a good one, too, Invasion of the Gabba Robots, all your base.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040
I'm sure that would have been beautiful.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.040
I should put a page on my website.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.160
the uh... three-month three entries that would have been in there for a week

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.600
got lazy and in fact i want to put mine in there too

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.920
uh... i'd ever finished mine either

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.120
well i also have a nephew to my manuscript for not working with mozilla

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.740
which the browser of the gods

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.200
but screw it but bad javascript

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.440
but mother nature you do not make me walk home four blocks and horizontal

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.360
rain

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.280
usf vb says fuck you today if he didn't get anything for the mystical rob epic

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.280
requests, so he at least deserves an F.U.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.280
Um, what?

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280
I have no idea what they're talking about.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.280
I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.280
What the hell are you talking about?

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:03.280
Uh, fuck you to Bobby Flay for crying like a bitch to get his rematch against Morimoto

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.280
and then winning a couple of years ago.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280
Wasn't that a... what?

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Dude, that was such bullshit.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.280
He got up, he like stood up on his little chopping board, he's like,

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.280
I'm gonna win!" And then he got his ass beat. And then he all came back. Morimoto's like,

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.280
no, he doesn't deserve to win. He disgraces himself as a chef because he stands on his

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.280
equipment. He can still do that. And then he gets back later. They go to Japan. And

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.280
he takes off the chopping board. And he puts it aside. And then he stands on the table.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.280
And it's like, okay, you're still a jackass. You're just an idiot. And then, I don't know,

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.280
I don't know, they said that he won, but that's such bullshit. They must have rigged some shit.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280
Because Morimoto is the king.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.360
just angsty little people

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.960
uh... if you to starbucks on broadway for being so slow says skyline d c five

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.600
oh five and it said it made him late to zero period

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.560
i'll teach it to the starbucks

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.740
the power says at the sleep because the sleeping schedules all screwed up if you

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:36.680
do is what the drive since yesterday and safe mode whenever you want to put a

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.680
file on a floppy disk

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.640
and also if you do you grant

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.660
because that

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:52.180
The pig in his Animal Crossing game because he magically changed his roof color to yellow

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.700
and it's been red since he started his game and now it's fucking yellow.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:01.220
And also an F.U. to EOSFBB since he set an F.U. to Vidpower last week when Vidpower wasn't

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.220
here.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.220
So, ha!

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:07.900
Yeah, I had two people paint my roof in my town.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.900
That pissed me the fuck off.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:11.900
Dude, they painted mine Pepto-Bismol pink. I hate Ed.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.900
I'll get paid for this little show.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.900
That's a good...

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.900
Oh God, my sight hurts.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.900
That was good.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.900
No, we don't.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.900
In fact, we pay to do it.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.900
That's the sad part.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.900
Send your checks.

01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.900
Send it to me.

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:02.900
No, the best way you could pay us is to whore this station out to all your friends and listen all the time.

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.900
We need to break our limit.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.900
Yeah, we need to break our limit.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.740
What? What? What? Jamie is loose.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.260
Just kidding.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:17.260
They're offering... They said we should set up a PayPal account. Well, we didn't do that

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:19.020
because we don't think people would actually donate to that.

01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:25.220
Well, if you want to pay me, it would be NightmareHunter at yahoo.com. I have a PayPal account

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.620
set up to send money, and I'll be appreciative.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.060
That was immediately followed by PayPal ruined the internet.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.060
paypal ruined my bank account when I had paypal

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:38.060
because we were like, oh let's buy neogeo cartridges

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.060
at $300 a piece, we can pay with paypal, it's easy and convenient

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.060
however it did facilitate me getting Mega Man X4 on Saturn

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:50.060
or Rockman X4

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:54.060
get all your friends to listen to the station

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:58.060
and take us out for dinner

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:03.700
and play around on their website. What you can do, you can set Orange Lounge Radio to

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:09.040
your very favorite radio station. And if enough people do that, then we start getting discounts

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.980
from Live 365. So if you want to kind of inadvertently give us money without giving us money, go

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.540
set Orange Lounge Radio as your favorite station on Live 365. Just go into your presets. You

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:21.620
just have to add Orange Lounge Radio as a preset. And then you're going to say which

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.300
one of your presets do you want to make your favorite station? Select Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.380
And we're all happy campers.

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.780
And I also do appearances.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:33.900
I don't charge that much by hours, so look me up.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.760
Yes, that's great if Orange Launch Radio is already

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.940
in your presets.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.380
But if you want to make it your favorite preset,

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.840
that's even better.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.580
And we love you lots for that.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.300
That's right.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.500
Helps us pay bills.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.860
See, I don't need to do that, because I just have a link

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.580
or a shortcut to my desktop.

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:55.580
So I don't even need to go on the I-365 for this.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.580
It sucks having a screen name for like 8 years.

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.580
Because I get so much junk mail on it now.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:30.100
my Dark Sakura thing. By the way, you know, I have to say something that I'm going to

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.020
actually retract one of my old FUs.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:37.660
Oh! Oh! Jamie is going to retract an old FU, so what do I do? Do I play Slagwort backwards?

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.660
Do I play a happy song? What do I play?

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660
No.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:46.380
Okay. Another FU to Pepsi and pretzels because I feel like I'm going to explode.

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.380
Cool, do it.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.380
No, um, play something happy.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.380
Play something happy.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.380
Play, um, the Changma song.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.380
The Changma song?

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.380
Yeah.

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.380
You know what, I don't think I have Changma cued up.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.380
I'm sorry.

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.380
How about, um, we can play, like...

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.380
We're playing old.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.380
Old? Boys?

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.380
No.

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.380
Boom Boom Dollar?

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.380
My Fire? Bad Girls?

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.380
Let's get down.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.380
Let's get down. Okay, this is a happy song.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.380
Alright.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:37.380
I'm retracting my F.U. about the people who sent me instant messages because now I couldn't hop on my DJ Celica. I'm going to go ahead and say it. I have a username now. I'm not going to give the full one out but it's primarily DJ Celica. That's one of my AIM names. That is not the full AIM name by the way because I'm not going to say the whole thing on the air.

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:42.380
I would sign on that and get no less than 17 IMs in one sitting.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.380
You should have seen it during the time that Shaft was going on.

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:50.380
Because I counted it during my first five minutes of being online without an away message.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.380
I had 30 IMs! 30! 13! I counted them!

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.380
You're so popular.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:02.380
So I'm actually really happy to say that I was on my name for a little while yesterday.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:09.380
I had the thing on for 10 minutes without an away message, and I didn't get a single message, so thank you.

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:17.380
However, one of my other AOL names that used to go on all the time, that one's gotten better.

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:22.380
There's people who are not randomly IMing me when I haven't given them the name their permission to IM me.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:30.940
Although I have to say, I took one of my names off of hiding, and lo and behold, even after

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:37.380
8 years, I'm still getting 20 million messages on that name, so I put it back on hiding.

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.500
I'm gonna go and be more specific with who I let see that one.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:46.660
And the people, by the way, who I don't mind messaging me, you know who you are, and I

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.660
never care.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:53.660
But for all those random people who, like, I barely know or maybe see, like, you know,

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:58.420
once I've seen you at, like, a tournament or something, or I haven't known you for longer

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:04.780
than at least two years, you know, you know, give me a few minutes to sit on line and just

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:11.380
be there for a while before you decide, oh my God, I have to talk to Jamie right now!

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.980
Unless your house is burning.

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.220
Unless your house is burning and then call a fireman, right?

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.920
i have your fire department

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:24.160
i'd never had to talk about that

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.420
i accept that it was unfortunately

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.440
by a

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.400

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:46.800
Yeah.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.800
Okay, I actually have an announcement.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.800
Announcement.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.800
Announcement.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.800
Announcement.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.800
A horrible way to die.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.800
A horrible way to die.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.800
A horrible way to die.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.800
Rob, I'm going to hit you with a ferret.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800
Ow!

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800
Anyway, um...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800
I want a pretzel.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.800
I got a pretzel for Saha.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.800
Anyway, um, this announcement, I don't know if anyone remembers me mentioning the, uh,

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:20.560
The thing based off a radio drama based off of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, there's one

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:27.640
position left open we need your audition reel.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:34.960
The position left open, if I remember correctly, is the drunken zombie date.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:41.080
If you're going to audition for this, you can go ahead and send me your auditions.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:46.200
We'll send it to the Orange Lounge thing because we don't know how big the file size is and

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:51.160
I really don't mind giving out my email over the web because like I said I get tons of

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.240
spam anyway so you can send it to darksacra.aol.com.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.240
That was just by the way the name that's hidden from anybody ever knowing that I'm online so

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.240
go ahead.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.400
You can buddy list that all you want to because you'll never see it but go ahead and email

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:11.640
Tell me your voice acting reel, your audition to Dark Sakura at AOL.com.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640
What kind of voice would that be?

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.840
Is it a whiny goth boy voice?

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.840
Drunken zombie date.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840
Drunken zombie date.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840
I think it's drunk.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.840
I don't know.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.840
Alright, so you have to be a drunken zombie.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.520
Very good, very good.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.880
And where's your audition reel?

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.880
You said you were interested.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.160
I got lazy.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.280
Just send them something.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.520
We're hoping to get under, I guess we're hoping to get underway with the recording soon and

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:42.040
it will be broadcast on this very radio station once we get a first episode out.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.440
And give that email address out one more time.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.800
Darksakura at all dot com.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800
Beautiful.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.080
Which is funny because I had that name before there was a Dark Sakura.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.080
Cool.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080
Yep.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:58.840
It was right after Sakura came out in Street Fighter Zero Two or Alpha Two for people who

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.240
never heard of the Japanese name.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:06.380
And uh, my stalker did not make it for me, but my teacher in my classroom used to call

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.560
me Sakura too in my Japanese class.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:14.880
So I made Dark Sakura, and then low and behold, like a year later, there was a Dark Sakura

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.560
in the home release of one of the games.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:18.560
Kao.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.440
Yeah, that's because I'm neat, so that's the whole history of why I have that name now,

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.120
but send me auditions.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.080
Alright we're gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna come back and do the cage match

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080
for this week.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.680
We didn't do a cage match last week, so we're gonna do tonight's cage match and then we'll do some more fun stuff

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.300
We got a list list to get to at some point tonight

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.180
So we'll do all that in a little bit

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.320
This will be a short break because we're gonna do be doing more music during the cage match

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.960
So we would just want to get up and stretch and pee

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.600
Yes, Jamie pretzels any pretzels

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600
Alright, we'll be back. See ya. Orange on radio.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:23.600
And I'm far away on the other side

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.600
She was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:30.600
And she couldn't find how to push through

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.600
She fell in love in the evening

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.600
Carried away by the moonlight

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.600
She had a chance of sorrow and grieving

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.600
Carried away by the moonlight

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600
She had a chance of pushing through

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.100
What's the feeling when I come Far away on the other side

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:58.600
He was shot six times by his man on the run And she couldn't find how he pushed through

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:08.600
I said, I said, I prayed, I'm here in heaven One day, falling in the morning

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.000
Carry me away by a moonlight, shed, shed

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.100
I'll watch your vision, body

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:21.100
Carry me away by a moonlight, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.100
So when he began to play the game

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.100
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:02.100
How he was hoping she was not the same

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.100
Could you see the kind of lady that I'm seeking

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.100
After all of this time, could this be true love

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:12.100
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:16.100
I'll give the love you need, do you holler in the guarantee

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.100
I'd like to love, boy, I'm a fine lady

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.100
You've been hurt, but be sure that I am the cure

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:26.100
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.100
The best day boy you know, you can count on me

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.100
Felicity!

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.100
You're the kind of lady, you know what you found in me

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:37.100
Is a lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need

01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.100
Maybe, a kind of lady that will never leave you lonely

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.100
And what's the name of this lady?

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.100
You finally set me up and I won't let you leave

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.100
See how I'm feeling

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:20.100
My heart sticks around and it's all clean

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.100
Ain't gonna tell me nothing

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.100
Ain't gonna shout no more deal

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:30.100
It's time to say goodbye, goodbye, say

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.100
I want you to know

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.100
I'm ready to be happy

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:39.100
It's my time, I need to face it

01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:41.100
I'll change for you

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.100
You don't have to love me again

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.100
Can't you see I'm going to bed?

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.100
I'll say, who are you?

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.100
I can't take you no more

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.100
I'm going to get it all

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.100
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, who are you?

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.100
Now I know what I'm feeling

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.100
Couldn't sit down, be in touch

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.100
I don't mean that, honey

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:18.100
But you mustn't mean that, honey

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:22.100
I'm living in reality

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.100
I'm a loser

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:27.100
So how I made up my mind

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:31.100
Oh, it's part of my good thing now

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.100
That's it for you

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:35.100
You're the loser

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.100
Well, you can't defeat

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.100
You're going to lose

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:43.100
Thanks for you, I can't take it no more I don't want you anymore

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:49.100
Thanks for you, you don't look too well Can't you see I'm going to love

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.100
There's a lot of things for you

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.820
So I can make it over

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.540
I don't care what you do

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.980
You make me feel so sorry

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.980
I can't take it anymore

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.980
So, do you think this is the end?

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.980
No, it's not the end.

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.980
It's the beginning of your next journey.

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:49.980
The Buh-Buh Pool Journey Part 2.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.980
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:06.820
orange lounge radio

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:10.100
dave's doing the dance

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:17.100
dave is doing the dance wait i gotta play that one more time just so dave can do the dance

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:19.300
okay here we go here we go

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:23.180
easier to dance to than that freaking catch up song

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:25.940
orange lounge radio

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.060
that's the best part cause that looks like ricky martin right there

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:33.060
It's like he's doing the Latino pada-pada.

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:37.060
Later on, even though you can't see it, I'm just going to do it anyway.

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.060
I said, screw you. You can't even see what I'm doing.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.060
I like that. EOSFBV. Spider-Man does the dance.

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:49.060
That looks stupid, though. Later on, all the girls

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:53.060
go like this.

01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:57.060
And for anyone who couldn't see, he just shook his hips in rhythm.

01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:01.620
Problems here. What's going on? Loki's flipping off my roommate's computer. What's your problem? Oh

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:09.160
Net zero. Do you want me to submit it for you? Like okay, Jamie's gonna do it. Okay, we're trying to submit Loki

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.160
Oh, I just burp that was gross burp

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.120
We're trying to submit Loki's attorney mix 3 entry right now

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:18.960
You'd F you to net zero because they suck ass and their servers are slow as ass

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.580
How many his ass is an adjective from now?

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:32.940
I suppose this is the portion of the show where we should get into another little thing

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:42.980
that we do here every week, and that is the Orange Lounge Cage Match, everybody.

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:47.580
Last week in the Cage Match, actually two weeks ago, we didn't do it last week because

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:50.740
we did a pre-taped show.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:56.620
So last week's winner of the cage match, a couple weeks ago was, I'm trying to find it,

01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:02.620
I can't find it, it was the Knight Rider theme. Done all happy hardcore style. Now remember

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:08.740
the way the, I'm sorry, not happy hardcore, but like, it's happy style. I guess is the

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.780
way, what you'd call it. Let me play, I'm going to play a little clip of that for you,

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.500
this is all you're going to hear, because we only play a clip of the winner from last

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:19.860
week, so here it is. This is last week's winner, winner. I love the chair, it's so beautiful.

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:23.460
I don't do real radio. This is last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme, a little clip

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:24.460
right here for you.

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.460
And now...

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:53.460
It sounds like it's doing the same thing.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.460
That's the part everybody knows.

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.460
Alright, that was last week's winner.

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.460
The Knight Rider theme done all redone.

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.460
Wait, I have one more F you.

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.460
Yes, Dave. You're a little late.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:13.460
I know, I know. I forgot about it. I had thought about it like on Wednesday.

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.460
I was like, damn, I need to, okay.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.460
I got kicked out of Jamie's chair.

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.460
Technically it's Brian's chair, but I claim it.

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:24.220
Yeah, you don't have to get music or whatever.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.660
I'm killing up the first contender.

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.660
So good.

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.660
I'm wasting time.

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.900
F you to all the people who think that everyone who goes to the gym is just compensating for

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.580
a small penis, because that's not true.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:40.380
Where does that come from?

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:45.900
I like going to the gym, because I am weak, but lots of people who don't go to the gym

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:51.340
It's like, oh, you stupid people just go to the gym because you have penis envy or whatever.

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.220
Rob's looking at me like a madman.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.220
I'm just confused.

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.940
I don't like the gym, but I don't think it's a penis thing.

01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:01.620
I like going when there's guys there wearing tight bike shorts.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.620
Not you.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:05.620
He does his little pose.

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:10.220
All right, back to the K-Smash.

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:14.640
I don't think you would get a date, especially if they saw you doing your little ketchup

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.560
chicken dance

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:24.000
sorry about this I'm I'm trying to find a particular part of this song

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.260
no, don't pose please, don't pose

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.960
okay

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.580
posing is fun

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.920
anyway yes

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.920

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:47.220

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:03.100
contender this is a band that I fucking fallen in love with lately I love this

01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:07.100
band they're a band called Frau Frau and the song is called breathe it don't

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:12.700
laugh it's cool they're cool Frau Frau Frau Frau rules and this song just makes

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.180
me think of, like, old women in MooMoos. They're all frow-frow.

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:19.860
Shut up. But this, no, this song rules. I love this song. Alright, we're actually gonna

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:24.300
play a remix of this song. Uh, this song is called Breathe In, which is the single, but

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:28.740
this is a remix of it that's a little more DER-happy-ish, and it's a remix by DJ Encore,

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.860
who, uh, has another song. Breathe Out. Yeah, no, it's just the, uh, Breathe In remix by

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.180
DJ Encore. So you can vote for this one, this is the first contender in the cage match.

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:40.580
What's about a, the beginning of a song by Bush? What, Breathe In?

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.580
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:44.580
That was Machine Head.

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.580
Got a machine head.

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.580
Got a mushy head.

01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.580
Got a mushy head.

01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:49.580
Okay, okay, here we go.

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.580
This is the first contender, you can vote for it,

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.580
but we will not accept any votes until both songs have completely played.

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.580
So you can vote for either the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:02.580
This is Frow Frow with the DJ Encore mix of Breathe In here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:03.580
I'm sorry that's not where it's supposed to start.

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:06.580
It's supposed to start right in here.

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.580
Here we go.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:14.580
this is a proper out

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:52.580

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:23.580
Cause I love you And I don't wanna love you

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:30.580
Only word, hard love Don't you understand, I've told you before

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:37.580
It's just air, off my case This isn't happening, to stop this now

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:45.580
And I'm, breathing in Feelin' so innocent, from the past, yeah

And I'm all your love from all the ways To ride away when you're spinning

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.580

Cause I love you, I have got love for you

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:54.700
Alright, that was Frow Frow with the DJ Encore remix of Breathe In in the cage match.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:59.700
So next question we gotta ask is, what did you guys think of that one?

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.700
Well...

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700
Dave?

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:07.700
I thought that it was pretty good, but it was kinda long, I mean, it almost...

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.700
It is six minutes, but I cut out the first minute.

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:11.700
I started, that's why I started.

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:17.200
I mean, it was still a little long, but I really think that it would go much better

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.700
without the lyrics, because they just kind of brought it down and made it sound corny,

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:27.700
Alright, that's fine. Jamie, what did you think of Frau Frau?

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.700
It reminded me of Beast Forest. Cool!

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.700
I wanted to take a nap. Loki, what did you think of Frau Frau?

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.700
Uh, the voice was annoying. Hey, I love Imogen, she rules.

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:43.700
She's not Anya! I had to go to the bathroom, so I thought I had to be Anya.

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:47.700
And of course, I loved it. Love, love, loved it, because I love Frau Frau.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.700
Alright, scale of one to ten. Jamie? Six.

01:43:51.700 --> 01:44:01.700
Matt, Loki. I'll go for six. Dave. Seven. I give it a ten, it's perfect. Diva. Alright.

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:08.700
Did you just call me a diva? I like it. Alright. Here we go, here's the other song we're gonna put in the cage match.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.700
So we got the Knight Rider theme, we got Frow Frow with Breathe In and this, Loki, please introduce us.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:18.700
Okay, this is another Overclock remix done by Final Fantasy Music DJ.

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.700
Now, okay, I have to warn you guys, it does have a really strange intro and ending to it,

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:27.700
just because this is a birthday gift to someone.

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:33.700
So, it'll get into the song, but just don't be thrown off by the annoying voices in the very beginning of it.

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.700
But it's an awesome remix of the Airship theme from Final Fantasy VII.

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.700
Alright, so here it is, another Final Fantasy remix.

01:44:39.700 --> 01:45:06.700
Hey, buddy! Happy birthday!

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:15.700
Guess what? I made you a remix of Sam's theme! Let me sing it for you!

01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:27.700
Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:34.700
Sounds like someone's, like, pleasuring themselves.

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.700
Oh

01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:59.700
Oh

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:57.500

We love getting mail, don't we all?

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.300
No, because I get nothing but spam.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.300
Well don't, yeah, don't send us spam.

01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.300
I like good mail.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.900
You send spam, fuck you.

01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:05.900
Send money.

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:06.900
Alright.

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.800
Oh, we had somebody vote for the Animal Crossing theme.

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:13.500
That's not one of your choices in today's, maybe next week's Cage Match, but not tonight.

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500
We'll play that once more tonight.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.500
We have another Animal Crossing song.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.500
That song is good.

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.500
We'll save it for later.

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.500
Do Animal Crossing music cage match.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.500
Dude, K.K. Kaspo would win because that's my favorite.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.500
No, it's all about Lucky K.K.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.500
You know Riverdance and Animal Crossing.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.500
SkylineDC505 says,

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.500
Isn't it too late to enter Tourney Mix 3?

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.500
No, I just missed the deadline by half an hour.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.000
You mean you got the deadline. I got the deadline by just a half an hour.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.500
So, half an hour.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.000
Very good, very good. So what kind of things were you considering when you made your DWI?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.500
What kind of things was I considering?

01:52:54.500 --> 01:53:00.000
What went into it? How did you pick the song? How did you design the steps? How did you do the background?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:07.500
Okay, the song I picked actually was my second choice, because I had a first choice, which is Alien World from 8th Style.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:11.500
I still have that halfway done. I just decided, no, I like the song better.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:15.500
So I picked that song. It's a bit succinct because the second part of the song,

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:19.500
the whole song kind of slows down as it's going through, gradually,

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:23.500
but I had to edit it down, and the second half of the song,

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:27.500
or second third, last third of the song, there we go,

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.500
is 128.036 BPM.

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:35.500
It's exact. The problem is though,

01:53:35.500 --> 01:54:04.500
The background took me maybe 10-15 minutes to do, I did it all in Photoshop, looks pretty.

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:26.500
The steps I finished just before I got here for the show, I finished the heavy steps. There's a part in it where it goes down the half speed in the middle and then it comes back up to 128.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:34.500
During the half-speed part, there's a 30-second note thing going on there, so it's kind of hard to read, but it's all synced.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:46.500
I don't know, they're pretty fun. It kind of plays like an era, but a little bit more complicated, so just try it out. It'll be fun. That's about it.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:55.500
Word. What do you think are going to be the big sim files to watch out for, the big artists or the big creators out there that are going to have some good stuff?

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.500
Well, I don't think Bimani ruler is putting anything in this time.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:03.500
So, they probably just have CMCM do something.

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:07.500
Then, Kamenkey makes a lot of stuff.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:11.500
V to X, whatever, does a lot of stuff.

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.500
I don't really know. There's a lot of people that know.

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:16.500
Or, DDR Master F might see something from him.

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:20.500
Moogle Hunter, definitely.

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:24.500
Just, I don't know. It's always surprising because you'll see people that you've never heard of.

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:28.800
and then just all of a sudden they'll come out with something pretty cool, so it's really hard to tell.

01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.800
I can't wait until they have an actual list of what's on there, then you'll kind of see with the tryout.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.000
I was going to enter, but I got lazy, so I'll enter a make it a get porn instead or something,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.700
even though I don't want any of the porn that Mookie's giving away.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:50.000
He had a really cool, you know, oh I made a really cool background for his song, and then he doesn't go and finish it.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I finished the basic and trick steps. I just only got about three measures into the maniac steps, so whatever.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Eh. Fuck contests. Fuck them right in the ear. I'll just release it because I'm cool.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000
It doesn't have to be. I don't have to whore it out under any contest. I'm me, damn it.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
We'll have a special contest. It's called the...

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Sky owns you at Sim Files, so nobody wins except Sky.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I could run a tourney mix, but I just don't have the web space.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to rip off a big idea, anyway.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Make it a get-porns-cooler, anyway.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
But, see, here's the thing.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
You know how they were going to have a special category where you actually have to pay to get in?

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Uh-huh.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
They were going to have prizes?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
They aren't having that no more.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Oh, that's a bummer.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
No one entered.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Oh!

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
No one entered.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Surprise!

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Nobody wants to pay money.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Go figure.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Well, anyways.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So, um, that fell through.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
But I can always do mine, you know, where I give out, you know, anime DVDs.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Woo-hoo!

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
DVDs!

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Alright.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.760

So we're going to start off with the Freshness in India Amazing Mix.

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.960
This is from DCB and his remixes are always very interesting.

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:30.200
DCB had a very cool one the other day.

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.400
He had a remix of Happy Meal that we played on a fuck-off that ended with the theme to

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:39.160
Hey Dude, which was like the coolest Nickelodeon show ever.

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.160
Hey Dude.

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.700
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:42.700
Hold on, hold on.

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:49.700
I'm gonna go to the end of the Happy Meal Evil mix here, just so I can play this.

01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:07.780
That show is the shit!

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:12.340
Loki's turning this shade of red I've never seen before from laughing so hard at that.

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:15.020
Okay, DCB, I've got a challenge for you.

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.140
Okay, DCB,

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:20.060

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.800
I want you to do a remix

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.420
that somehow involves

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:28.280
the old school you can't do that on television theme.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.380
If you can do that,

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.100

Well, I thought I had another one even somewhere.

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.220
This was going to be a paranoia remix until I said, nah, it doesn't really sound that good.

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:54.160
Shit, my bad. I don't think I have it yet, because your other CD's going, alright, so maybe we just won't play a Loki original, I guess?

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:54.760
We'll play that one.

01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.640
Alright, we'll play that one. Okay, we'll do a Loki remix. It's called Shadow Style.

01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:58.800
Okay, so here we go.

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:27.200
If you hip and you hop, then you can hop and you hip

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.200
You can hit the rock and you can hop the track.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:55.200
Come on and let your body flow.

02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:02.200

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:49.560
We're going to do a list list soon, but we've got to prepare our list, so we've got to hold off on that for a little bit.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:54.660
But they will be the top three things that ruined the internet, so we'll be talking about that later.

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:55.760
Umm...

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:58.060
But now, let's see, do I have any other topics that we'll...

02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:02.560
Oh, we need to announce the Cage Match winner, that's one thing we need to talk about.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.960
That's right.

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.360
Orange Launch Cage Match, the song, that will be in rotation all next week.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:11.660
The winner, ladies and gentlemen...

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:17.660
Two weeks in a row, the Knight Rider theme has won the Orange Lounge Cake Match.

02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:19.660
Guess what? Guess what? Ha ha ha ha!

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:27.660
I will knock the Knight Rider theme down next week. Mark my words, it'll be gone!

02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.660
You wish.

02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:36.660
Now we do have a rule though, that how many weeks do we say? Four weeks? Three?

02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:37.660
A month.

02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:44.040
The song can't be in for more than a month or it's got we retire it we get Carson daily out here to retire your song

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.160
from total orange requests life

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Next week, he'll be Tom's greens

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:57.600
Piggy hill I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill

02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:01.760
I'm gonna throw the piggy down. I'm gonna throw the piggy down

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.640
I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill that for about five minutes

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:11.560
I'm just going to trump all you fuckers and put in the legend, because we already know

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.760
the legend is popular on this station.

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.820
We try to keep the Bimani Music Amore show a little clean, because we know people listen

02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:24.880
to it at work, so we don't have fucks and shits during the Bimani Music Amore program.

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:30.000
But since Sunday night you're here listening to this program, we know you're not at work.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.640
So we cuss all we want.

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.200
Isn't that right, Dave?

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.560
Fuck, cut, shit, balls, cunt, lick, ass, pussy.

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:40.200
Thank you. That was amazing.

02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.200
Skillfully done.

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:44.400
I'm no match for Brad.

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.300
Are you preparing your list for Listless now while I'm just sitting here ranting?

02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:47.700
Yes.

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:51.100
Okay, great. Then we won't have to take another break. We'll just be able to go

02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.160
right into Listless. I have to think about mine.

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.060
So, let's play one song while we prepare our list, shall we?

02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:02.900
We'll play one quick song. It's gotta be something fun. Let's see.

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:02.920
doo doo doo doo doo doo...

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:04.600
Instant love!

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.780
Okay! Everybody loves instant love.

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.680
Instant love.

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:10.240
That's a good idea.

02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:11.080
Instant voo.

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.680
Alright we'll be right back with The List List,

02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:18.420
top three things that ruined the internet, right after this.

02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:22.260
Hey everyone! This is DJ Konami!

02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:24.740
I know you all know BeatMania,

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.200
but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.680
Listen carefully and try to follow!

02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:33.680
The object will come down from the trunk.

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:36.680
When it hits the red line, push the button.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680
Yeah!

02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:41.680
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:45.680
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:48.680
First, hit the white key.

02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:55.680
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:12.680
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:14.680
Both white and black keys.

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:25.680
Easy, huh?

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:28.680
Alright, let's go on to the scratching.

02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.680
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:36.680
And if you think it's fun playing with you, boy, you're better

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:41.680
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.680
Now it's all the keys and the turntable

02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:55.680
It's hard, but you can do it

02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:21.680
Ok, F-Exercise! Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:24.680
Look, way below, do you see the first switch?

02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:28.680
That's the effect of an on switch.

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:31.680
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.680
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:42.680
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:48.680
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:55.680
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.680
Alright, gotta go! Knock me out with your fabulous sound!

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:23.680
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:28.680
The server made a bit of fighting ahead of us. The server made a bit of fighting ahead of us.

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:37.680
Hello, we're back. Sorry we had to take another break so fast here, but we were unprepared for our list list, so we want to make sure we got that all done.

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680
We're prepared now.

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:45.680
We're prepared now. We've come prepared. As opposed to coming unprepared, which is, you know, messy. Anyway.

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:47.680
Oh, lovely! Hello!

02:14:47.680 --> 02:15:05.680
Oh, I gotta find some background music, though. I know Jamie brought us plenty of background music to start using. Oh, we have another visitor? Is that for us? Let's see, we shall see. Matt, go get the door.

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.680
I bought some fun music.

02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:11.680
Now, I know you did. I saw some things that we could do. Oh, wait. Am I looking in the cookie? No, I'm looking in the wrong directory.

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:13.680
Uh, I thought you had...

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:18.680
Oh, Dave's parents are here already, I guess.

02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:19.680
Uh-oh.

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:22.680
Oh, they're pulling Dave away from us.

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:24.680
Oh, no, they're pulling Dave away. What are we going to do about list lists?

02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:28.680
Really?

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:31.680
Tell him to leave his list here, because we've got to do his list.

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:32.680
His list is here.

02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:34.680
Is his list still here?

02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:35.680
His list is here.

02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:40.680
We'll have a member from our chat room vote for us.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.680
Okay, we'll have a person from the chat room vote for us.

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:46.680
Or maybe we'll just all pile together and see which one we all agree on.

02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:47.680
No, he's still here.

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.680
Oh, he's still here.

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:54.680
Can I just read my top three real quick?

02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.680
Who's going to eliminate one?

02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.680
We'll have somebody from the chat room. We'll call somebody and have them eliminate one.

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:00.680
Okay.

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:01.680
My top three.

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. I've got to get the theme here. Hold on, hold on.

02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.680
I'm going to recycle this theme from last week because it's all I've got.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.680
It doesn't matter.

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:10.680
Okay, hold on, here we go.

02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:12.680
Okay.

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:19.680
My top three are random people who I am.

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:23.680
Chain letters.

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:26.680
And porn sites that say that three is up there.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.680
I can't say that.

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:29.680
I'll say it later, well.

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:31.680
Okay.

02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:33.680
And, I gotta go.

02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:36.680
You did it my first time.

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.680
Bye!

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.680
Dude, he took one of mine.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:43.680
Later, Dave.

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:49.680
We're gonna make a special surprise phone call to one of our listeners to have them pick something to eliminate off the list.

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:50.680
We'll do that later.

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:52.680
Don't start sending me your phone numbers.

02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.680
I already have the person picked out that we're gonna call, so just shut up.

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:58.680
I still have to think of the number too, because he took mine.

02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:05.680
All right, we'll read those again. Is Dave and his parents gone, so I'm going to read some of these.

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.680
Would you poke your head out the door, please, real fast, Matt?

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.680
There it goes, okay.

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:12.680
Those top three, once again, from Dave.

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.680
Random people who instant message you.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:17.680
Chain letters.

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.680
And porn sites that say that they're free, but they really aren't.

02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.680
Just in case you missed those. Okay.

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.680
So now, let's get back to the three of us here.

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:32.480
It keeps my inserts out, my bad.

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.160
Alright, uh, Jamie.

02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:36.680
Number three? Your number three choice, please.

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:37.760
Microsoft.

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:43.480
Microsoft ruined the internet. Yeah, because of all their, um,

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:48.160
you know, the MSM you can't delete from your computer, and all of their little

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.600
sending them all your crap.

02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:53.360
I guess I should say spyware.

02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:56.820
Microsoft in particular.

02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:00.380
Microsoft in particular ruined the internet. Next, Loki.

02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:04.580
What ruined the internet? Number three.

02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:09.980
Forty-year-old men pretending to be eighteen-year-old women.

02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:12.700
I have a funny story about...

02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:17.980
Forty-year-old men pretending to be eighteen-year-old women. Yes, please tell your story.

02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:22.980
This is when my fiance had just gotten online. He was using my friend Julie's account and she had a Catwoman name.

02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:29.980
And this guy propositioned him, thinking it was a woman for sex.

02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:31.980
You know, like cyber.

02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:36.980
So what they did is ended up taking him into the I.M. and talking about power tools the whole time.

02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:39.980
The guy was like, so what do you want to do first?

02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:42.980
And Dan replies, I have a circular saw.

02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:45.980
Do you like jib saws?

02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:49.980
I have a reciprocating saw the whole time.

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:19.980
website that I believe ruined the internet, and that website is GeoCities.

02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:24.760
You mean GeoCities? I believe that GeoCities ruined the internet

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:30.260
by allowing any dumb fuck to have a home page. Some people should not have web pages. Some

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:34.800
GeoCities pages are cool, admittedly, although the banners fuck them up, you know, their

02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:37.140
little pop-up thing that they have on the right.

02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:41.160
DJ Bads? Yeah, I know, I know. There's some cool things

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:19.160
As in, people who write fanfics and do fanart that I don't agree with, for lack of a better

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:20.160
description.

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:25.820
Like, people who do crossover fanfics.

02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:31.660
And I'm not talking about good crossovers, but people who do really bad ones, like things

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:38.900
that could not ever happen or, you know, again, I write fanfiction, that's fine, but just

02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:45.020
like the Internet is a haven for bad writers. It's a haven for good writers, too, but you

02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:48.780
really have to look through a lot of shit to find it. And then there's people who put

02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:55.620
up their art and they obviously haven't spent any time pricing. And I understand if maybe

02:20:55.620 --> 02:21:00.620
you're learning and you're improving, but I've seen sites of people whose art gets continuously

02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:06.500
worse. And then I am me saying, oh, well, my picture's better than yours. Those are

02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:11.220
the people that I hate, and the internet is just a haven for me. Not that I discourage

02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:15.660
writing, not that I discourage fan art, but I'm talking about the people who post it with

02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:21.020
the superiority complex.

02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:24.500
Going back to GeoCities, because Dark Tetsuya wanted to point out that his website's on

02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:30.780
GeoCities. Again, you're part of that cool 2%. Don't worry. I'm just saying 98% of the

02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:32.380
GeoCities webpages, they're ass.

02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:37.880
Hey, my first time was on Geocities. My dark stock was mostly Evil Shrine.

02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:40.380
But compared to what you have now, was it as...

02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:42.380
It was actually decent for a hand...

02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:43.880
For its time. It was ahead of its time.

02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:45.880
For HTML done in WordPad.

02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:50.880
Alright. Fair enough. Okay. As long as you didn't use that auto generator. Alright. You're cool.

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:52.880
This is bullshit. I either used that or Dreamweaver.

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.880
Alright. Good. Good girl. Alright.

02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:57.380
Then we had Bad Fandom.

02:21:57.380 --> 02:22:01.380
And now Loki's number two pick, what is that?

02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:05.380
Um, I guess I can go with, okay fine, whatever.

02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:09.380
The lack of e-prostitutes. You can buy everything online but women.

02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:13.380
What the hell? You can buy a wife.

02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:17.380
You can buy a wife? I don't want a wife.

02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:21.380
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I, wait a minute, wait a minute. We have to research this now.

02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:28.380
up

02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:33.780
and i'm i'm looking up all dot i'm looking at my old uh... friends

02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:34.820
from uh...

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:35.580
all i guess

02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:36.420
is this it

02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:37.540
i think this is it

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:40.540
i'm looking up all the friends of the funny ranch from under station live i'm

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:42.520
trying to find their website

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:46.460
and i'm trying to see if we can see i easy online reservations

02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:52.260
you can't get a profit you can reserve a prostitute on the internet

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:55.420
different that's like making a reservation at what's going on by the

02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:59.300
freedom of thought i don't know how i don't know

02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:02.360
you what you want to cite this actually the simple of the hot damn it i'm

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.420
getting all these pop-up ads

02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:05.660
the fact that

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:09.540
now i don't know

02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:11.380
like uh... red octane you know

02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.580
you can't are you comparing

02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:19.420
red octane to prostitution. Hey, it could be okay. You pay a certain amount of money

02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:23.300
for like a monthly fee, they send a woman to your house with a shipping label. You know

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:27.260
when you're done with her and then you ship her off? The site you're looking for is called

02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:37.260
realdolls.com. Oh my god. Can I actually sit in the same room with you every Sunday? Alright,

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:43.260
my number two pick for Thing That Ruined the Internet. Oh god, this is a good one. Number

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:55.040
or two thing that ruined the internet? ICQ. ICQ, back in the day, was alright. I mean,

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:59.600
it was one of the first instant messaging programs before cool ones like Yahoo showed

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:07.400
up. And AOL, even though AOL is kind of crappy now, AOL instant messenger is still cool.

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:14.600
But ICQ is like the shithole of IMs, it's like the program that people who don't know

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:16.880
how to use any other instant messenger program use.

02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:24.080
I cannot stand ICQ, I get the weirdest messages from people on ICQ, I don't use ICQ anymore

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:27.400
because of random people on ICQ.

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:33.200
If I have one more 16 year old woman from Brazil emailing me over ICQ wanting me to

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:39.120
go to some website to see your boobs. I'm going to scream. Dude, I need to get on ICQ.

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:43.920
I mean, ICQ constantly sends you ads, and now it's all, like, added out and stuff, and

02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.200
they sold it out to the man. So then I stopped using ICQ a long time ago.

02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:51.080
Ever since ICQ sold out, they've sucked. ICQ ruined the Internet.

02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:56.640
Well, I have my number one. All right, let's hear Dark Sakura's number

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.480
one thing that ruined the Internet. Lazy typing. As in people who use the letter

02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:14.680
you instead of writing Y-O-U or PLZ for please. I don't mind lead, but I've also put for lazy

02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:22.480
writing too. I want to add in Asian typing too. I don't mind lead, but I really, really

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.480
hate all the rest of it because it makes people look ignorant. There are people who, if they

02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:33.240
start typing that way to me, I'll be like, type English, you know. I will completely

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.320
ignore them. I'll be like, I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that the letter U stands alone

02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:43.320
as its own word. You know, I'll go check it on dictionary.com and post them a link and

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:45.440
everything, so I hate it.

02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.440
Alright, so lazy and Asian typing. You know that's funny because it's very similar to

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.240
my number one, but I think my number one's a little different. It's different enough.

02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.240
Alright, Loki, your number one thing that ruined the internet, and he's already laughing.

02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:02.240
Mac users!

02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.240
Leave it at that.

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:10.240
Oh, shit!

02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:14.240
Do you care to back that up? Because I think somebody's going to have a severe problem with this.

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:18.240
Actually, I kind of wanted to change one of mine on there.

02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:22.240
Okay, we can go back a little bit.

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:28.080
users ruin the internet? Because they have their stupid iPods and their iMacs and their

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:34.360
rounded computers that all they are good for is connecting to the internet. You know, toasters

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:43.360
are only good for making toast, so they're really not that far from a toaster. Oh shit

02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.160
that was funny. Okay, Jamie, you want to change one of yours now? I actually rethought my

02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:53.040
my bad fandom one, because everyone has to start somewhere, and bad fandom just encourages

02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:54.480
people to go look for the good stuff.

02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.480
Alright, and you know what?

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.400
I was actually going to take that off the list anyway, so...

02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:59.280
So I'm going to change it to pop-up ads.

02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.480
Pop-up ads, alright.

02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.520
Yeah, because pop-up ads need to be on there, so we're getting rid of bad fandom and putting

02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:06.520
on pop-up ads.

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.920
You're going to need the negative to encourage people to look for the positive, and everybody

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:13.080
had to start somewhere, so I retract it and apologize.

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:14.080
Okay.

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:16.240
Black Lab's having a fit in the chat room, this is great.

02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:18.240
I know, I did that on purpose.

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:20.240
Oh, you did it on purpose just to piss him off?

02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:22.240
You ass!

02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:24.240
You're cool.

02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.240
I'm just gonna have a third one, so...

02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:30.240
You know, by the way, we might have a special in-studio guest, Black Lab, here next week.

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.240
I was just kidding, Black Lab, I'm taking it off as my pick to remove from the list.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.240
Alright, alright, alright.

02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.240
Just don't worry.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.240
We'll get to that later.

02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.240
We'll get to that later, we'll get to that later.

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.240
I wanted to take it off.

02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:41.240
Can I read number one? Can I do my number one?

02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:42.240
Alright, alright, alright.

02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:45.240
Number one thing that ruined the internet, in my opinion.

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:48.120
the caps lock key

02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:51.700
god yes

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:54.740
i'm sorry where the music

02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:57.600
the caps lock key ruined the internet

02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.360
don't ever use it

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:00.520
ever

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:03.240
the only time you can use it is if you're me and you're doing the listless

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:04.240
segment

02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:06.120
like i'm doing right now

02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.860
that's the only time you can ever use the caps lock key

02:28:09.860 --> 02:28:14.000
otherwise you shift that way you don't type in all caps

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
If I see one more person at my work typing caps, I'm going to cry.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Here, you can change mine if you want for Mac users to MIDI music that plays when you go to web pages.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Alright, so we're changing Mac users now? Geez, alright.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Except my old Dark Soccer page has MIDI's that play, but that was because at the time that was cool.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.000
GeoCities, by the way, will not let me take down that page.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
It's still up there, my old Dark Soccer page.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
That's cool, why won't they let you take it down?

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I have no idea, I can't. It was actually after Geocities and Yahoo did their little, you know, they screwed it and, you know, spawned something. So I haven't been able to log into my old accounts.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Have you noticed all the commercials for Yahoo? Like, they promote Yahoo as a meeting place for, like, the scum of the Earth. You've got, like, the dating ad with people with big hands and that really ugly chick that's an astronaut.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.800
I mean, they just show ugly, nasty people they're on Yahoo.

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.400
Who'd want to be on Yahoo with all these freaks?

02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:16.200
So you're saying Yahoo ruined the internet?

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:17.800
Yahoo.

02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.080
Internet commercials ruin the internet, OK?

02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:22.160
Too late, we have our list.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:23.000
Let's read the list.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:23.960
Here we go.

02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:25.720
This is the list as it stands currently.

02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:29.840
Random people who IMU, chain letters, porn sites that

02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:33.920
say they're free but really not, Microsoft, 40-year-old men

02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:41.640
pretending to be 18-year-old women, geocities, pop-up ads, lack of e-prostitutes, ICQ, lazy

02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:46.600
typing or Asian typing, MIDI music that plays when you go to websites, and the caps lock

02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:47.600
key.

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:52.140
So, that all being said, Jamie, what is coming off this list?

02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:53.140
What ain't so bad?

02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:54.640
Lack of e-prostitutes.

02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:55.640
Lack of e-prostitutes.

02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:59.920
Cause I don't really give a care about sluts.

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:04.920
Alright, anything else you want to say with that, or just, you don't like sluts?

02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:06.920
I don't like sluts.

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:09.920
Okay, I'm getting an early vote already. It is not time to vote.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:12.920
DZB, your vote doesn't count.

02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:16.920
You have to wait, because that thing you voted for might come up.

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:19.920
You get smacked with the ferret.

02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:24.920
The ferret's over here. Oh, you're doing a slash me?

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.920
Forget it.

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:28.920
She just took the keyboard.

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:30.920
Now we have to wait for Jayden to...

02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:32.920
Alright, I can do mine because I already...

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:33.920
Oh, you already know what it is?

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:35.920
Yeah, mine has to go...

02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:40.920
I'm going to take off the porn sites that say they're free but really aren't,

02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:42.920
because free porn sites are like the fountain of youth.

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:43.920
They don't exist.

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.920
You just don't know where to look.

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:56.520
a look. There's no such thing as free porn sites. There are back doors to porn sites.

02:30:56.520 --> 02:31:05.160
Whoa, back doors. Happy hacker dot com. Happy dash hacker dot com. Persian kitty dot com.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:09.640
I believe. Double x password dot com. Anyway, this is a thing. I'm usually bullied by man

02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:24.120
me man porn? Is it free? Yes. It's all boys and boys though, but anyway. I used to have

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:28.480
a DVD, but I got rid of it pretty quickly once I got it. It was one of those free Vivid

02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:36.960
DVDs that they gave me. I don't get them anymore, but... Alright. Oh, I'm sorry, back to Listless.

02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:40.960
Oh yeah, I gotta take that off. Porn sites say they're free, but really not.

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:42.880
And that comes off the list.

02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:45.200
My turn to take something off the list.

02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:51.320
I'm going to take off, um...

02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:54.040
I'm going to take off MIDI music that plays when you go to websites.

02:31:54.040 --> 02:31:57.520
Because one of my old websites also had a MIDI song that played in the background. Fuck you, they're cool.

02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:02.680
Mine played Street Fighter MIDI. Mine played Tori Amos.

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:12.680
Alright, fine, I should just reiterate. Actually, MIDI music's not that bad. I don't like it, it's annoying, but I hate the sites that make you download MP3s to get into the site.

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:14.680
Yeah, I agree. That's stupid.

02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.680
What's that, like a porn thing?

02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:21.680
Oh, that's what I was trying to play, MIDI music. All you have to do is hit stop, and it, you know.

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:24.680
Actually, that's Good Cool's site. That does that.

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:25.680
Really?

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:30.680
Bad Good Cool. Bad. Oh no, not Good Cool. It was Ryo Nagumi. Or, Nagumu.

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:41.680
Alright, now I'm going to try this phone thing, and we've all had really bad experiences with this in the past, so I'm going to call someone who I'm pretty confident is listening to the show.

02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:48.680
And I'm a little upset that Loki took the Mac user's thing off the list, because this would have been an exciting telephone conversation if that were the case.

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:57.680
Rob, why don't you get one of those car hookups for your phone, and then you can plug it into the microphone thing here, and then everyone can hear it.

02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:59.680
Because that's too easy!

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:02.680
Julie's going to be giving us a real phone hookup.

02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:06.680
Actually, that's a really good idea. Yeah, we're going to be looking into the phone hookup thing. Don't worry about it.

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:09.680
But for now, we don't have that, so here we go.

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:13.680
Let me place that phone call here.

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:25.680
That was a lovely film.

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:27.280
Oh, it's not this. I almost...

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:28.280
Yeees.

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.280
Hello, Black Lab.

02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:31.480
Hello.

02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:32.680
Can you hear us fine?

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:34.080
Yeah.

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:36.480
Do you have anything you want to say to Loki, first off?

02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:38.680
Yeah, Loki.

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:40.280
I don't need you, man.

02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:42.880
I can...

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:46.280
If I were there right now, I'd whip out a whole sheet of information

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.480
that I can shove in your face and put it here on.

02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:50.080
Alright, the cell phone...

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:51.280
I was gonna defend you.

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:55.080
The cell phone thing sounds like crap, so we can't stay on this too long,

02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:00.460
But do you do you need me to read the list for you? Do you already have something that you want to come off the list?

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:08.660
All right, here is random people who instant message you chain letters

02:34:09.700 --> 02:34:10.860
Microsoft

02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:13.460
40 year old men pretending to be 18 year old women

02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:22.460
women, Geocities, pop-up ads, ICQ, lazy or asian typing, and capswap key.

02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:31.460
I think what's going to go is the chalers because I don't get many of them and the ones

02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:36.460
that I do get I just delete right away because I know that if it says porn on it, it's just

02:34:36.460 --> 02:34:37.460
crap anyway.

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:41.460
So you're saying people should stop being lazy and set up an email filter?

02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:44.460
Yeah, that's why they're there.

02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:14.860
Oh, I see. Are you mocking this segment? Is that what you're doing?

02:35:14.860 --> 02:35:18.460
No, it's just I think it's more entertaining to pick really weird shit

02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:21.460
instead of actual serious answers because everyone else has

02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:24.660
the same answers I would have used. So, there.

02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:29.500
Okay, you can vote now during our listless segment. We're gonna take one last break.

02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:33.340
Read off the list one more time. Oh yes, of course we're gonna read off the list one more time.

02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:36.580
Just gotta post it in the chat room. Here it is. Okay, here's what we have. You ready? Yes.

02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:41.020
Random people who I am you, which I hate, Microsoft.

02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:44.700
40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities,

02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:48.060
pop-up ads, ICQ, lazy typing or

02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:52.340
asian typing, and caps lock key.

02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:57.180
So vote. Alright, vote now. 9 p.m. Send me a private message in the chat room

02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:00.460
or email. Or you can send it over email real fast

02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:04.820
and we'll count those votes up. Oh, that reminds me, I got a late F.U. over email too.

02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:08.060
I gotta get to that when we come back. We'll take a quick break and then come back.

02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:08.420
What?

02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:13.840
I hope that's not for me. I don't think so. We had one come from somebody else

02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:16.940
listening to the show. I forgot to read it, but we'll get to it.

02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:20.940
So, top three things that ruin the internet when we come back from this

02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:23.840
break featuring some Beatmania final music.

02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.840
Enjoy!

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:25.840
their way out

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:27.840
Shizune Deku

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:29.840
Utekata no

02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:33.840
Yume ni

02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.840
Sashi Tatsu

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:37.840
Kono Uotena

02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:39.840
Ito

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.840
She's a goddess of the wind

02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.840
The Bonnie Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:22.840
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen,

02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.840
draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.840
A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:34.840
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 24.

02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:36.840
We're wrapping it up in the last segment here.

02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.840
I'm sorry, Jamie?

02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:38.840
Because we're special.

02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:39.840
special

02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:40.840
special ed

02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.080

that's right he got to join us via phone tonight

02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.960
he'll be here in person next week maybe

02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:57.960

week by the way is going to be like our big wrap-up show and we're going to do a list

02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:18.440
list probably for the best Bomani song of 2002, maybe another one for any song that's

02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:24.440
been released in 2002. Any Bomani song that's been released in 2002. And we might also do

02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.520
one if we've got time for like best thing in the Bomani world for 2002. I'm also going

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:33.660
to do a special pre-show of stuff that was either, assuming that I have all the files

02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:38.660
for stuff that was in Second Mix or BeatMania Substream, or 2DX Substream.

02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:40.660
Cool. Old stuff.

02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:43.660
Old school stuff. You know, maybe go up as far as Second Style.

02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:46.660
Ooh. So it's going to be old.

02:42:46.660 --> 02:42:47.660
Old school.

02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:51.660
Okay, let's reveal the winners of this week's List List segment.

02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:55.660
Ferret roll, please.

02:42:55.660 --> 02:42:58.660
The top three things that ruined the internet.

02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:02.660
All right, number three, Jamie, what ruined the internet?

02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:09.660
Jami, what is the number two thing that ruined the internet?

02:43:10.860 --> 02:43:17.860
Pop-up ads. Pop-up ads suck. Go to hell. And the number one thing that ruined the internet?

02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:24.940
Lazy typing or AZN typing. Which I find incredibly funny because they were all my picks.

02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:25.940
Were they really?

02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:26.940
Yes, they were.

02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:31.500
Shit, Jamie is the winner today.

02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:35.340
Although there's some other things to get a vote, and some interesting things that were

02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:40.580
said in the chat room, things we didn't put on the list at all, USFVB suggested that Orange

02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:43.260
Lounge, in fact, ruined the internet.

02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:44.860
Harry Potter websites.

02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:45.860
No!

02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:46.860
You ass!

02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:52.860
Excuse me, wait a minute, you gave me Alan Rickman movies, so I'm not going to kick

02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:54.860
Thank you, but I'll hit you with the ferret.

02:43:57.860 --> 02:43:59.860
Darktetsuya says, the ferret ruined the internet.

02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:06.860
What else ruined the internet here? I don't know.

02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:12.860
Suggestions. Chat room, give me your suggestions for what other things ruined the internet that we forgot to say.

02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:13.860
Target.com.

02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:14.860
Target.com?

02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:15.860
eBay.

02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:17.860
eBay. Why did eBay ruin the internet?

02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:20.860
Because it makes me spend all my money.

02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:25.860
Actually, Half.com has been taking up more of my money lately because I've been finding laser discs.

02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:28.860
I think a good one would be LiveJournal, ruin the internet.

02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:30.860
No, I like that.

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:36.860
You know what sucks is I have the money and I have the actual, I just don't have the space.

02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:40.860
I could have bought a BeatMania Complete Mixer 500.

02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:41.860
Dang.

02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:44.860
I would have stored it for you.

02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:47.860
Eh, it's a little late now though. I'll wait when I move out.

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:50.660
We had another vote that twin ruin the internet.

02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:53.200
Gay porn sites ruin the internet.

02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:54.660
I don't think so.

02:44:54.660 --> 02:44:57.140
Priceline.com ruin the internet.

02:44:57.140 --> 02:45:02.860
Animalcrossing.com ruin the internet. William Shatner ruined the internet.

02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:05.200
There is no Animalcrossing.com.

02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:10.020

02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:51.360
Yes, I have Neopets. I'm on there as DJ underscore Celica.

02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.360
Battle.net ruined the internet? Pokemon ruined the internet.

02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.360
Oh, this is a good one. This is great. Oh, Vidpower gets mad props for this one.

Hamster Dance definitely ruined the internet.

02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.360
Ultima Online.

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:11.360
Oh, fucking EverQuest.

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.360
How did we leave EverQuest off of our list?

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.360
I'm still pissed at Ragnarok.

02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:18.360
EverQuest completely ruined the internet.

02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:21.360
It not only ruined the internet, it ruined real life.

02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:27.360
I'm still mad, though, at Gravity for Ragnarok Online

02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:30.360
and making it where I can't play anymore.

02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:33.360
If they were reliable, maybe I could play again

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.900
and get my goggles back

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:38.440

internet cafes through the internet for allowing anyone to get dot coms are in

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:30.160

The web ruined the internet.

02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:34.160
People ruined the internet.

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:36.160
Stupid people.

02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:40.160
Which, by the way, stupid people ruined everything.

02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:48.160
And, you know, I find it very funny for those people who, when you're going on fan art sites, trying to download fan art, you right-click to save a picture and they go,

02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:50.160
Oh, you can't do that, blah, blah.

02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:52.160

02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:54.160
Yeah, I know, stupid people.

02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:56.160
Or if they have it where you can't save the pages.

02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:58.160
You go to view their web source.

02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:05.160
any knowledge of how to use their computer in a graphics editor, it's called print screen.

02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:06.160
That works.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.560
I wanted to end it on that note that people ruin the internet, but there's just too many

02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:11.720
good ones that are still coming in.

02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:13.560
People did ruin them.

02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:16.080
Final Fantasy Online is going to ruin the internet.

02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:19.000
They're doing that on, no.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.160

Okay, Xbox Live has ruined my life, okay?

02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:39.800

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:51.880
but you know what?

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.080

Yes, Google, the only unbiased search engine.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.940
they refuse to take

02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:22.460

02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:24.900

So, shit, where's that F.U. music I had earlier for our chat room?

02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:56.380
What's something random?

02:51:56.380 --> 02:51:59.380

02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:19.540
That came from Martin Tan.

02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:20.540
Thank you.

02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:21.540
You know what?

02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:25.620
I've decided something that I want the tournament to do for me or all of our listeners.

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:27.340
Oh, you have a command.

02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:28.340
Yes.

02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:36.140
Do you still have a link to that sorting quiz that I gave you?

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:42.300
If you can remember the first few... It was a virtual Hogwarts... No, just do a

02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:44.380
search for it on Google.

02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:48.300
I'm rather curious because I'm still in my little fan phase right now.

02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:53.060
I want to see where everybody in the chat room would find themselves sorted.

02:52:53.060 --> 02:52:56.700
So I want them to take the sorting quiz that is the best one ever.

02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:57.700
Is it Hogwarts?

02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:58.700
Is it this one?

02:52:58.700 --> 02:52:59.700
Hogwarts?

02:52:59.700 --> 02:53:00.700
This one?

02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:01.700
This one?

02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:02.700
Seven Dragons?

02:53:02.700 --> 02:53:03.700
That one?

02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:04.700
Okay.

02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:05.700
We're going to post a link in the chat room and I want everyone to take it.

02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:09.180
And when it asks you to pick your preference for a house, pick no preference.

02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:10.180
Yeah.

02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:11.180
I want to see where it puts you.

02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:14.860
So, you're going to do this, you're going to say, there's a little link on there that

02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:15.860
says...

02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:16.860
Get sorted.

02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:17.860
Get sorted.

02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:18.860
Click here to be sorted.

02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:20.520
It's on the left column.

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:24.700
At the very end of the quiz, it'll ask you if you have a preference for a house.

02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:26.220
Click no preference.

02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:27.220
It's right underneath the press.

02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:30.340
Because if you've seen the recent movies, you'll know that if you have a preference,

02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:31.340
that's what you're going to get.

02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:35.860
By the way, twins, shut up.

02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:39.140
You wonder why you're on my computer.

02:53:39.140 --> 02:53:40.140
I got Slytherin, by the way.

02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:41.580
I took this test and I sorted it into Slytherin.

02:53:41.580 --> 02:53:43.900
I always get Slytherin.

02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:46.700
Black Lips says he already took it and he's in Ravenclaw.

02:53:46.700 --> 02:53:51.620
You're a nerd.

02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:55.180
Make sure it's this test that you took.

02:53:55.180 --> 02:53:59.200
this test and find out where you get sorted. Don't tell us in the chat room, we're not

02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:05.880
going to tell you there. Email it to the Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll make a tally, or post

02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:09.580
it in the live journal. When we get back from Bobo, I'll put up a link in the chat. SoCal

02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:15.940

I'm going home and working my website because, I don't know, I have nothing to do.

02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:55.080
I did my work for the week.

02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.280
Jamie's furiously trying to kick.

02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:06.280

02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.960

Dextrive died. By the way, if anyone happens to find a Dextrive anywhere in their town...

I'll pay you five bucks for it.

02:55:48.220 --> 02:55:50.300
Jamie had that look on her face when, uh,

02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:51.800
Loki took the microwave, like,

02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:56.860
you asshole! And then, like, all of a sudden when Loki said that, she was like, oh, nevermind.

02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:59.680
You live for now.

02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:02.900
Uh, DarkSakurai, he has them, they're up, they're just not linked.

02:56:02.900 --> 02:56:04.660

02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:08.260
Cool. We can get some mine up there, too. Wouldn't that be neat?

02:56:08.260 --> 02:56:11.700
My final thought of the week is

02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.300
I hate people that I go out on dates with. I hate them all.

02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:18.520
And besides, you can have the results

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:20.340

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:25.060
make-edit-get-porn contest. They're all Max USA edits. Whee!

02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:26.960
Oh, okay.

02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.900
I should enter that just for the hell of it. You should.

02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:36.060
I'll send the porn to my brother. He's in the military. He needs it.

02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:38.900
That hard up, huh? I mean...

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:42.060
Wait a minute. That's not what I meant to say.

02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:46.740
My brother's a marine, and he's living in San Diego.

02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.620
Interesting.

02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:50.100
Okay, I guess that's it.

02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:51.660
You have to point out...

02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:56.460
Is the fortune cookie in the directory all by itself, Jammie? Okay, then we'll have that all taken care of.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:57:00.300
I guess that's it. We'll see you next week when we're going to do our holiday wrap-up.

02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:02.920
And... this one? Okay.

02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:05.320
And uh...

02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:07.320
That'll be it.

02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:09.320
And then we're going to do a tape show on the 29th?

02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:10.320
I did my final thought!

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:12.320
I thought you did.

02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:13.320
I was kicking twins.

02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:14.320
Oh, okay, sorry.

02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:15.320
Jamie, yes, your final thought?

02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:19.320
Okay.

02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:20.320
Thank you, that was riveting.

02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.320
I'm going to go home and watch all of these Alan Rickman movies.

02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:25.320
You'll never see me again.

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:28.320

02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:54.320
This is a special moment right now. We'd like to take this time to tell all the kids at home,

02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:57.320
send your parents out of the room. This is a kids' song.

02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:01.320

You're gonna have to mow the lawn, Do the dishes, make your bed

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:14.820
You're gonna have to go to school until you're seventeen

02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:17.320
It's gonna seem about three times as long as that

02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.320
You might have to go to war, Shoot a gun, Kill a nun

02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:25.320
You might have to go to war when you get outta school

02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:27.320
You're gonna have to deal with stress.

02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:28.320
Deal with stress.

02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:29.320
Deal with stress.

02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:34.320
You're gonna be a giant mess When you get back on the war.

02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:39.320
Santa Claus does not exist And there's no Easter Bunny.

02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:44.320
You'll find out when you grow up that Rick Christopher isn't funny.

02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:48.320
Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

You're gonna end up smoking crack on your back

02:58:57.120 --> 02:58:59.720
Face the fact, you're gonna end up hooked on smack

02:58:59.720 --> 02:59:01.720
And then you're gonna die

02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:12.120
And then you're gonna die
