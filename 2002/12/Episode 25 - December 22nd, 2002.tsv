4952	8875	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10476	15520	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19168	22090	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22430	25611	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26192	28913	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29453	32335	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33135	33556	Just kidding.
33756	36217	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.
41756	44859	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
45059	47180	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72205	74786	Nobody expects a Spanish exposition.
75026	75846	It's Kendo.
75946	78467	Hey!
78687	79747	DarkSakura.
79927	80527	Shut up!
80707	81387	Where's my gun?
81527	83888	This is my boomstick.
83948	84528	Sky.
84668	86449	Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.
86749	87349	Loki.
87489	90510	I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90550	93371	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
93591	94891	Orange Lounge Radio.
98112	102254	We are live, and this is episode number 25 for December the 22nd of 2002.
102314	110437	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most old-school station, as judged by the pre-show, correct?
111357	123062	Of all things bee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-
124600	128322	Joining me as always are the other two pieces of the pie.
129162	133424	Say hello to the apple pie in that corner, Jamie.
133584	134264	The bunny pie.
134644	135145	Apple?
135465	136765	I don't know, what pie would you be?
137245	137886	Mincemeat.
139266	140327	Mincemeat pie.
142148	147570	And then that corner, the, I don't know, the Judging By His Christmas Present, he'd be the sugar pie.
150291	151392	Say hello to Loki.
151832	152192	Hey, buddy.
154834	162068	And also joining us tonight, the one, the only, you know him, you love him or you hate him, I don't know.
162209	163070	It's Black Lab.
163130	163411	All right.
167165	171228	I know, we got that stupid humming noise back tonight, I can't figure out what's going on.
171248	176432	I think I need to do a reboot, but I can't do the reboot in the middle of a show, so I don't know what to do.
176512	181215	We'll figure out if we can figure out what's going on, and we'll be back in a little bit.
181375	185578	But first I gotta queue up a song, so what do you guys want to talk about tonight?
185598	186879	What are we talking about tonight on the big show?
186939	190362	We just literally ran in here a little bit ago, so we're still kind of...
192057	194419	What is it with Maxim Magazine hating Canada?
194439	196701	They just, like, rip on Canada every page.
197822	198403	They really do.
198463	198943	It's weird.
199704	201745	We gotta talk about Christmas and all that fun stuff.
201765	202906	Christmas sucks.
203447	204368	Christmas is sucks.
204648	205268	Go Yule.
205969	206610	Uh, so...
208769	211253	We're going to play something from the brand new 8th style soundtrack.
211293	212174	Doesn't that sound like fun?
212755	214137	It sounds squealicious.
214358	218865	Okay, we're going to play the radical mix of Abstract.
219005	219906	This song's pretty cool.
219926	220807	Good, this doesn't suck.
220988	223071	Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.
296138	296740	Thanks for watching!
537475	546066	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
546166	551953	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
558243	562644	Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
562684	566205	Tonight is very... Damn, we don't got no one listening tonight.
566245	569566	We're very low on the listeners and people in the chat room and all that stuff.
569586	571946	I guess the holidays really do fuck everything up, don't they?
572826	574487	Either that or people forgot about us.
575307	576227	Sniff, I cry.
576947	585789	Well, tell a friend, tell a relative, tell everyone that Orange Lounge Radio is on the air and we love new listeners, so yeah.
589008	596339	Anyway, we have candy and cookies.
596820	600205	Yes, we have lots of yum eats today.
602211	603552	This is going to be one of those shows.
603612	605313	It's probably a good thing no one's listening.
605673	607295	Well, actually, it's probably going to wait.
607415	609796	Just wait like a half an hour once all the sugar kicks in.
609876	611317	Once all the sugar kicks in, this show's going to be crazy.
611337	612838	Then we'll be buzzing around the room like flies.
613078	614820	We do have plenty of stuff on the agenda tonight.
614840	617742	We're going to do another rendition of Orange Lounge Match Game pretty soon.
617782	618262	That'll be fun.
618382	619062	Yay.
619443	624546	And we're going to do... Our list list tonight will be the best Bomani song of 2002.
624586	626487	So that'll be fun.
626768	627148	Woohoo!
627728	630750	And just kind of some other year-end junk to talk about today.
632892	634633	I don't know, how are we going to start this big show off?
634693	635854	We want to do the FUs of the week?
635914	637375	We want to do the sim updates?
637555	640077	We can talk about anything that's in this Maxim magazine.
640398	642860	Why don't we talk about Loki's Christmas present from Jamie?
644021	644821	Let's talk about that.
645382	646743	I gave him the gift of cleavage.
647944	651567	I got a Maxim magazine and I got a bunch of chocolate.
652107	653168	A whole bunch of chocolate.
653628	656090	Like tons and tons and tons and tons of chocolate.
656110	656671	But no nuts.
657111	658132	No nuts, because I hate nuts.
659112	659453	But, um...
660949	664531	I'm a good present giver because I remember.
664712	666252	But this book is awesome.
666313	673317	I mean, it's got, well, other than the fact that it's got this really cool page with this topless cheerleader that's just, oh my god.
673717	675958	That's what I want next year, okay?
676699	677019	Right there.
678451	682892	Um, let's see, it tells, they have a page here, how to amputate your own limb.
683873	684153	How?
685033	690575	Uh, what other, how to date a cheerleader, how to make a turducken, or whatever that is, I don't know.
690615	691515	How to play craps.
692755	693476	It's just awesome.
693496	694516	How to deck your lawn.
694536	696937	You know, crazy stuff like that.
697417	701418	Speaking of Maxim Magazine, don't you have an announcement to make about your little competition?
701926	710859	Oh yeah, due to the fact that our wonderful message board went down again, I am postponing the due date by two weeks.
712342	712883	For what?
713083	714485	For MakeEditGetPorned.
716933	717534	Winner is you.
717914	721977	Why don't you explain one more time, even though no one new is listening tonight, I'm sure because our listener count is so low.
722377	724618	Tell us all about MakeEditGetPorn.
724638	738267	MakeEditGetPorn is basically you make an edit for any song that's on DDR Max USA, and you send it to me some way, either it be a DexDrive save, a DWI file, a step chart, whatever.
738628	740989	You just send it to me, and you're entered.
741109	743791	The winner gets a big box of porn.
744932	746413	That's pretty much it.
747131	750373	So basically, you make an edit and you get some porn.
751353	751653	Maybe.
751673	753054	But you have to win to get the porn.
753114	754315	You have to win to get the porn.
754695	756976	You get a lot of porn.
757757	761018	As things look right now, there's like two people entered.
761679	767202	Which is another reason, another thing that prompted me to push back the deadline by two weeks.
767922	771364	But yeah, so that's pretty much the contest right there.
771884	775166	As it stands, VidPower has a suggestion.
776360	779542	He says it shouldn't be merp, make, edit, receive porn.
779582	783645	Because then he can say merp.
783865	786067	Why do we have to drop everything down to acronyms?
786928	788489	F you to acronyms, okay?
790750	802358	Anyways, so... Yeah, that means futa.
803199	805441	Page 100, the acronym show, you mean TASP?
807802	809223	Dude, they have nude elves in here.
809604	810104	Nude elves?
810144	810604	What?
811345	812046	Wait, what is this?
812466	815168	Why are there... I don't... Okay.
815869	816609	That's pretty cool.
817150	819992	Maxim Magazine is such a dirty little rag.
820012	820893	I love it.
822494	823014	Surprise.
823895	825056	Yeah.
827523	828144	Stretch.
828984	831346	Yeah, they have stuff about video games.
831386	833208	What's the video game that they reviewed this week?
833528	834088	Nightfire.
834589	835189	Nightfire.
835389	836951	They gave it four out of five stars.
837531	838152	James Bond.
838292	842135	Yeah, it's like Goldeneye.
842875	843636	Okay, you want to fuss?
844036	844757	Jamie wants to fuss.
844777	845498	I want to fuss.
845878	846819	Jamie wants to fuss.
846859	847579	Fuss about something.
847719	848780	Are we doing FUs already?
848820	849621	This isn't the FUs?
849641	851362	This isn't an FU, but I need fussy music.
851382	852283	You need fussy music?
852303	853124	Whoa, look, balls.
854767	860390	This guy is holding bread together to where it looks like balls in that big cock.
861731	862791	What fussy music do you want?
862811	863912	You want your normal FU music?
864132	864852	Um, no.
865593	866393	What's your fussy music?
867034	867394	Gravity.
867754	869515	You want gravity for your fussy music, okay.
869535	870395	Yeah, I need tack.
871216	874478	Let's see if I can find fussy music.
875718	876659	Fussy, fussy, fussy.
879720	880161	Okay.
881461	882122	What the hell?
883827	884587	She's a hoe.
885307	885968	Okay, here we go.
886388	887288	I have your fussy music.
887628	889869	She likes being beaten when she has sex.
891509	891829	Okay.
892669	894710	Today we went to Roseville Golf Land.
895750	897070	And boy did it suck.
898191	902171	We went over there to play some Parapara and some stuff.
902732	906413	And I just got so sick of all the machines being down that I went and fussed the manager.
907633	907973	His name...
909068	910109	with a list at all.
910909	913091	I have a... No, I made the list after I fussed with him.
913191	913611	Oh, wow.
914051	915232	Well, you can do it again.
915252	916193	His name was Chris.
917393	918634	He's a tall guy.
919635	920656	He's a tall guy.
921516	924718	And he was wearing a vest over one of those button-up golf lid shirts.
924818	926659	I went and I fussed with him.
926739	928721	I said... Excuse me, I'm trying to fuss.
928801	929081	Anyway...
939068	941329	I asked why the machines were in poor repair.
942670	945111	And I named off machines one by one and what was wrong with them.
945871	948353	And his eyes just got a little bit wider and a little bit wider.
948653	951414	And he decides to use this condescending corporate talk.
951774	955456	Okay, I worked for a corporation for two years and I'm working for another one now.
956037	958418	Although that's not quite as professional, I should say.
958458	959378	Hooray, corporation.
961199	966202	Anyway, he was like, well, I'm sorry you feel that way, and blah, blah, blah.
966322	967683	And the tech comes in on Monday.
967763	969584	I'm like, hire another tech.
969624	970544	What, the tech?
970864	971325	Yeah.
971545	974086	I remember hearing they have three techs at Rosemont.
974106	975547	You said the tech, the D tech.
975567	981390	Well, apparently, they must have three techs, and they all come in the same day and just drink beers and watch football.
981410	981850	Is that true?
981930	983091	Oh, yeah, I was about to say that.
983151	983471	Anyway.
988206	989767	I was like, well, then hire another.
990828	993090	And he's like, well, corporate deals, blah, blah.
993150	996794	I'm like, okay, if all of your funding comes from your corporate office.
997474	999396	Tell corporate to suck your corporate cock.
1000037	1001778	I don't have a, anyway.
1002499	1004541	Eat your corporate clit then, I don't care.
1006275	1014060	Anyway, I was like, well then explain why I haven't noticed this many machines down at SVGL.
1014521	1016482	Or I haven't seen this many machines down at MGL.
1017222	1018203	CVGL!
1019644	1021205	I started naming off places.
1021325	1033173	I'm like, you know, if all your funding comes from Gothland Corporate, why are these other Gothlands in such good repair and this one has so many broken machines?
1034479	1035200	Well, I don't know.
1035221	1035962	I'm like, you know what?
1036484	1041175	I'm like, if we don't see some improvement here, there might be an organized boycott of your facility.
1045012	1046894	Oh yeah, but I probably wouldn't go anyways.
1046914	1052098	I walked off, took out my notebook, and proceeded to write down all of the machines that were broken.
1052519	1054741	I have a list, but I'll leave my list after.
1056602	1059945	I have a silly comment, but Black Lab used to work for the Golf Line, right?
1059965	1060766	The Golf Line Empire.
1061127	1065270	I was just wondering what your manager would have done had Jamie came in and said, lick my corporate clit.
1066431	1067853	Okay, first of all, my...
1069369	1071010	First of all... Who would have said that?
1072350	1080493	Well, first of all, my manager was Mormon, so... Yeah, that would have just made the situation all the more awkward.
1080513	1081874	I didn't question anything.
1081894	1082474	You were nice.
1083434	1089416	Yeah, but a constructive argument for my manager would have actually produced some kind of result.
1090177	1096639	I mean, but... Then again, Capture Valley is like a fifth the size of Roseville.
1097572	1100580	No water slides or go-karts like there are on Earth, but anyways...
1107405	1108927	What are you looking at now in this fax?
1109467	1111529	Oh my god, it's the Rapture!
1111689	1114732	What is... I know about these.
1114892	1117935	Okay, time to... I think she's kind of fussing about the pictures.
1117955	1120618	Dude, you just turned red.
1120778	1121358	Okay, cut.
1122119	1125442	Yeah, Rob's complaining about things already going on a train wreck.
1125923	1127765	This is what's broken right now at Roseville Golf Land.
1127785	1129947	By the way, they had a really crappy service today.
1130687	1132249	Anyway, um, hip hop...
1133968	1135129	What's new today?
1136550	1138432	These were just the obviously broken things.
1139073	1141935	Okay, I didn't go by and personally test every game.
1143357	1146259	But first of all, the Hip Hop Mania, it eats tokens.
1147080	1149502	I lost two dollars in tokens on that thing today.
1150543	1151364	They wouldn't give it to me.
1154389	1155430	Okay, Guitar Freaks was down.
1155791	1163678	Um... Drum Media was put out of order because the drumsticks weren't tied to the machine, but I just took the sticker off and just played it anyways.
1163698	1165080	DDR4th Mix was down.
1165100	1167462	However, they were turning it on when we were leaving.
1167482	1169484	I think someone switched right there for a second.
1169704	1177411	Um, uh, DDR Max 2, um, you said the left player up arrow was broken and the right player right arrow was broken.
1177772	1178232	Other way around.
1178292	1178573	Oh, okay.
1180201	1182882	First player up there, I was the second player.
1182902	1184043	That's what I'm saying.
1184623	1189025	And Potapota has one of the sensors on there that's a little bit loose.
1190305	1192526	For the Medieval Madness, Pinball is down.
1193326	1194407	Roadshow Pinball is down.
1194467	1195907	Revenge for Mars Pinball is down.
1196728	1198288	Time Crisis Clare 1 is down.
1198708	1199649	The Grid was down.
1199969	1201669	They had it all taken apart.
1201709	1205831	They had like separated like one at each corner of the Arcade or something.
1205851	1207011	Radical Biker is down.
1207071	1207652	Radical Biker?
1209471	1211592	That's the only game that's not working in the UDL.
1211652	1212553	I'm just naming all of them.
1212653	1213533	And it's like, it never works.
1213593	1216295	Um, that game War, the third player was down.
1216315	1220597	Germania 7 has an unresponsive cymbal.
1220937	1225780	Um, I'm finished with what came back with, uh, Loose.
1225800	1226521	Not working properly.
1226581	1227781	I'll just say the first player's fine.
1228021	1231023	Keyboard Mania, player one, um, the wheel was broken.
1231043	1232804	The wheel was the first player's fine?
1232884	1234605	It was working fine when I was playing it.
1234885	1236166	It's been broken for a while.
1236226	1237207	It's a little bit twitchy.
1239724	1241325	Don't let this happen to you.
1242065	1243606	So how many games is this that I've named?
1243626	1250230	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 games.
1250390	1255153	I'd like to announce also that their ticket counting machine is inaccurate.
1255813	1261537	It in fact counts less tickets than you put in there, no matter what you do, because the retards don't empty it.
1263905	1265186	You sound like the comic book guy.
1265446	1267907	I would like to point out that that chicken machine is inaccurate.
1268488	1268888	Worst.
1269368	1269968	Episode.
1270429	1270849	Ever.
1271809	1272630	You know what, this?
1274191	1275131	Possibly, yes.
1275171	1275611	No, no.
1276432	1277592	We rule.
1277673	1278013	Any other?
1278633	1283296	Worst episode ever was me doing it live from freaking the tournament.
1283356	1284856	That was the worst.
1285897	1288398	And stop it.
1288759	1289179	I'm closing now.
1290282	1294764	Anyway, this is what I'm planning on doing, so I hope that all of our listeners see what Rose spoke off as.
1294784	1295045	Oh, a plan.
1295065	1295405	P-L-A-N.
1295425	1296325	That's not an acronym.
1296345	1298266	Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie has a plan.
1298286	1298486	Thank you.
1320497	1323938	No, we need the fanfare from Ron Campbell.
1324338	1329240	Anyway, the plan is this.
1329260	1332022	We've tried petitioning them before, you know, sending letters.
1332502	1335243	We only sent in a few letters, so this is what I'm going to say.
1335743	1344907	For everybody who has a complaint regarding Roseville Gothland, if you want to see some changes going, you know, there's supposed to be power in numbers.
1344967	1346748	I'm going to send a letter to Gothland Corporate.
1349506	1353109	to complain about the shoddy performance of Roseville Gothland.
1353189	1355892	I'm going to send it to Steve Boss.
1357314	1363120	Yes, Steve Rogers was his name, who is the general manager of Roseville Gothland.
1363200	1367364	Also, you know, the fact that he was so unresponsive during the whole time we were trying to get our tournament running.
1367945	1371489	I'm sending a letter to the Gothland corporate, fussing about him.
1372932	1374493	I'm surprised.
1374574	1377255	I thought something would be shaken up there.
1377335	1383880	I heard that Shiggle Boss went up there, checked the place out earlier, like last week sometime.
1384621	1386422	Like to help with the tour or something.
1386682	1388383	There needs to be more than just that.
1388403	1393307	I'm even wanting to enlist the aid of anyone with a good digital camera to go take pictures of the machines.
1394691	1398693	Nearly 7 out of 10 women say that they're unhappy with the size of their lowest penis.
1398733	1399573	Loki, shut up for a minute.
1399593	1402434	Back some time later.
1402614	1406936	Last time we did that, took a digital camera and took pictures, and we put them up on the internet.
1406976	1407976	They were pissed.
1408376	1409637	They were so pissed.
1409777	1410397	We'll do it again.
1410417	1410877	Let's do it again.
1410897	1412298	Let's do it again.
1412318	1413018	Let's do it again.
1413038	1414019	Take your pictures this time.
1414119	1419241	And you know, we had a thread on that open on DDR Freak for six weeks with links to those pictures.
1419501	1421321	Can I be in the picture with a sad face?
1421582	1421722	Yes.
1423142	1423743	And you know what?
1423763	1427325	We should photoshop Captain Jack into a picture and have him crying.
1427345	1429587	You know what?
1429747	1432228	Am I not incorrect that it worked last time?
1433469	1434310	Yes, yes it did.
1434350	1436151	We had our keyboards replaced on Keyboard Mania?
1436191	1436771	Yes, it did.
1437692	1438332	So you know what?
1438793	1439293	Let's do it.
1440014	1443776	Let's go ahead in there.
1443856	1444196	And, uh...
1447267	1461494	You know, there's something, I don't know if anyone has ever worked in customer service or in any type of service where they've given, you know, training classes like that, but for every eight displeased customers, only one person ever does something about it.
1461854	1462795	That's sad.
1463195	1469538	And the thing about this, each of the people that are displeased with the service are going to go and tell another eight people, at least, and spread the word.
1470018	1473220	I would just like to point out that I used Jamie's example in a training class the other day at work.
1473500	1473820	You did?
1473840	1474120	That's cool.
1474140	1474281	But
1477626	1478408	See, that's the point.
1479329	1485439	You need to think that for every single complaint letter you get, there are seven other people who are pissed off at your company.
1485459	1488063	You know, you see what we're going to do?
1488424	1491028	We're going to make sure there's quite a few more than just eight.
1492840	1496864	And to point out, Orange Lounge Radio, we're an international show.
1496884	1499045	We've got listeners in Japan, listeners in Canada, all over.
1499526	1503309	Our world headquarters is Sacramento, California, so this is kind of a local topic.
1503729	1507152	But even the people, we've got some folks in Vegas in the chat room right now.
1507252	1510755	VidPower says, I feel sorry for you guys and our cage should not be messed up that bad.
1511095	1513717	Yes, we bitch about RBGL because we want your pity.
1513877	1514458	That's the point.
1515138	1520482	Well, on top of that though, we're making a point for anybody else, you know, around the world and country.
1520782	1526526	If you see your arcade or any place that you frequent that's in poor condition, do something about it.
1526846	1528728	Just say, oh god, this sucks.
1529551	1534394	and not doing anything about it, is that people don't know what they're doing wrong until you tell them.
1534434	1537957	Just keep in mind that the vast majority of people in this world are feminists.
1537977	1538757	They're stupid.
1538837	1541018	I'm not saying everybody is stupid.
1541099	1544020	I'm not saying everybody is stupid because obviously our listeners have a brain.
1546722	1559737	but you know there are a lot of really dumb people in the world and they just don't get it and they keep doing something thinking that they're doing something the right way and in the meantime they don't know just how bad they're fucking up especially if your arcade smells like pee
1560589	1561609	That would be Laser Force.
1563670	1567332	I swear, I smelled fish while I was playing DDR at Roseville today.
1567912	1569053	Me too, I smelled fish.
1569193	1572034	I was like, dang, somebody needs to douche.
1574195	1576036	It was nasty.
1576676	1579917	It distracted me when I was trying to play.
1580217	1581218	It was sick.
1581238	1585860	Golfland is filled with the rag smell of pussy and I don't like it.
1587825	1590346	At least no little kid came and took a dump by you while you were playing.
1590366	1595887	Oh, you didn't have to see someone trying to change your baby's diaper on the keyboard, maybe.
1595947	1598588	I have a little horror story about Golf of Heaven.
1598948	1599148	Uh-oh.
1599968	1605590	Yeah, when I was working at Castle Quest at CBGL over the summer, some little kid...
1606210	1625882	I think it was around Labor Day weekend, we were trying to fix some air conditioning on the roof, and all of a sudden I walk over to the edge of the roof to check around to make sure there's no little kids running around, and I see this little brown pile sitting on the sidewalk out in front of the Arcane.
1625902	1630004	I'm like, that can't be from a dog or something, can it?
1630765	1634627	And then I get a complaint from my bosses like,
1635389	1637591	Ryan, the toilet's clogged, could you go take care of that?
1637912	1645338	So I go walking over to the bathroom, I look at the toilet, and there's a little kid's pair of boxers filled with crap sitting in the toilet.
1645538	1651444	There's like a half a roll of toilet paper crammed in there with, like somebody tried to flush the boxers down the toilet.
1651904	1653385	How stupid can you get?
1653405	1654026	No, I had to...
1655048	1660409	And then I walked outside and there was like little trails of drops of crap laying on the sidewalk.
1661110	1664610	Up to this big pile over by one of the starts of the golf courses.
1664790	1666011	I had to clean that up.
1666031	1666851	It was nasty.
1667031	1670632	I don't think I need any more chocolates tonight.
1670652	1672972	Thank you.
1673172	1675133	Well, maybe they won't keep you aside for that.
1675153	1676073	That's a good thing.
1676153	1677313	Okay, Santa's getting some.
1681098	1684520	We're looking in the... That damn Maxim again!
1687581	1688121	Read the quote.
1689262	1691082	And here's a candy cane for you.
1692023	1696704	It's a picture of Santa and some woman on his lap with her underwear.
1696825	1702647	Is this like a shot of Santa sitting from the knees down and then some other particular... Let's hear it for Maxim.
1704202	1706723	Anyway, so back to what my point was.
1707463	1710245	If anybody, it doesn't even matter what it is.
1710345	1712886	People don't know what they're doing wrong until you point it out to them.
1713566	1718248	Make sure that if you're going to complain about something, you do it in a constructive manner.
1718768	1725871	You point out item by item what is wrong with what they're doing, how you think it can be fixed, and then you send it to the people who can do something about it.
1726572	1728653	Don't give it to some peon because they're going to lose it.
1728793	1731754	Which means go over everyone's heads until you get to the top.
1732423	1733424	Go as far as you need to
1751848	1753709	Loki will give you a little quote from it.
1754990	1762937	They're talking about, like, Santa's new album, The Ho-Zone, and it claims it was the first single, Get in the Sleigh, Bitch.
1765259	1765799	Yeah.
1766620	1770784	And that gets the, okay, whatever, it'll be a week.
1771384	1771725	Anyway.
1773446	1774607	I think now's a good time to go to break.
1774627	1775067	What do you think?
1775087	1775167	Yeah.
1776485	1780106	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2020283	2021245	Thanks for watching!
2075597	2076379	Thanks for watching!
2125658	2126240	Thanks for watching!
2245469	2247050	Thank you for watching!
2269224	2274750	I don't know if you guys heard the news, but I remember last week we were talking about DDR Extreme and the rumor that it was coming out on Christmas Day.
2275111	2276612	And I said, what a bunch of bullshit.
2278454	2279435	Ah, you were wrong.
2279475	2279796	Whoops.
2280917	2281417	My bad.
2281598	2284401	It is coming out on Christmas Day according to the Konami official website.
2286063	2288025	So, okay.
2289560	2290821	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2313877	2314337	How are you?
2314498	2315599	I am good.
2315839	2316419	Hi, Amanda.
2316459	2316860	Say hello, Amanda.
2316880	2317740	Hi, I'm Amanda.
2318241	2318861	And this is Yana.
2318881	2319222	Say hello.
2319522	2320063	Hello.
2320763	2321824	And they've come to visit us.
2321864	2323486	Now, Amanda, you're a big DDR fan, right?
2324887	2325427	I guess so.
2325888	2327249	Do you still even play anymore?
2328110	2328170	Um...
2329634	2334337	I think the last time I played... Actually, no, wait, did we... I played once, like, that's the last time I came over here.
2334997	2336918	I went and played, like, once at Q's R on a fourth.
2336938	2338119	Well, where did you used to play?
2338139	2342041	Tell us about some of the folks that you used to play DDR with and when you got started and all of that.
2342622	2345423	Um, started off at Mountain Mike's, because that was, like, the only machine in the area.
2345764	2348045	Well, actually, that's when I really, really started it.
2349486	2351727	Machine got really crappy, so we stopped playing.
2353068	2355469	Then we got a seventh mix, so everyone was there.
2357010	2357391	And then...
2358639	2361081	My work schedule got busy, so I stopped.
2362242	2363022	What is this you show?
2363643	2364464	Shame on you.
2365404	2366725	They're not, no, they're, no.
2366965	2368607	I know, I know, they're perfectly legal.
2368647	2369788	I've seen those things before, but.
2369888	2371789	They're just natural, they're just natural cigarettes.
2371829	2372450	What does this say?
2372490	2372770	Let's see.
2373050	2373951	It's just the brand name.
2373991	2375772	Can I say over the air what these are?
2375832	2376172	Yeah.
2376273	2377614	They're ecstasy cigarettes.
2377934	2378734	It's just the brand name.
2378794	2380856	It doesn't have anything to do with the company.
2380976	2383737	It doesn't have anything to do with going to the rave.
2383757	2386878	No, it has nothing to do with MDMA, no.
2387139	2388699	Let's see, let's read the ingredients.
2390060	2392301	Damiana, wild lettuce, catnip.
2392661	2393681	Dude, catnip!
2394762	2396102	Let's go smoke some catnip!
2397023	2400284	And passionflower, mint, love and light.
2405806	2407887	Damiana, I used to work at GNC for two years.
2408928	2409868	Damiana makes you horny.
2411152	2416137	Very, very, very important.
2417118	2419421	We used to sell it to old men who couldn't get it up.
2421463	2422584	Herbal Viagra.
2423866	2424446	Inhale.
2427409	2428190	So, yeah.
2428831	2431454	Yeah, you do realize you've walked in on a DDR talk show, correct?
2431474	2431754	Yes.
2432523	2434466	Why don't I have the greatest idea?
2434486	2437289	Oh, remember at the bowling alley that had the really crappy third mix?
2437389	2437930	Uh-huh.
2437950	2441134	My friend who works there pretty much got on the guy and says, look, you know what?
2441875	2443698	The reason this machine isn't making money is because it's crap.
2443718	2444378	You don't keep it up.
2444619	2446261	And basically, she just basically told him like it was.
2446601	2447583	There's a seventh mix there now.
2450046	2453967	Pretty much the bowlers before were complaining about everyone like stomping on it, it was interfering with their game.
2454047	2454327	Right.
2454467	2461830	And now, because it's pads work, you don't have to stomp as hard, and the thing that they're complaining about mostly is the music now, so they just kind of turn it down, but it's still playable.
2462370	2474833	It's funny that you mention that, because in the last segment, Jamie was just talking about Roseville Golf Land, how a lot of their games have gone to shit, and how she was going to write a boycott letter to the management, the high, high, high management, like corporate.
2475574	2475854	Nice.
2476014	2476474	God.
2477114	2479595	Yes, God of Golf Land, so it's funny that you bring that up.
2483474	2484774	So, wow.
2484954	2487776	So, what else is going on?
2487856	2488216	I don't know.
2488256	2491058	What's new in the world of Amanda that she can talk about on the radio?
2493419	2494780	Did you meet Ryan in the front room?
2494840	2495500	That's Black Lab.
2495520	2496881	I don't know.
2496901	2498041	He's online, dude.
2498061	2499162	Is that the one who answered the door?
2499602	2500122	Yeah, probably.
2500403	2503984	He's kind of looking at me weird like, uh... Who the hell are you?
2505245	2506866	He's like looking at us like, what the hell?
2509893	2514697	Evil Women trying to take over the house.
2515078	2516279	I love that CD.
2516479	2517380	I love this CD.
2519041	2519682	What, Frow Frow?
2519742	2520723	I love Frow Frow.
2521143	2523706	We've been talking about Frow Frow last week on the show.
2523726	2525487	We'll talk more during break.
2525507	2526368	Whatever.
2526789	2527489	I call it Frow Frow.
2527509	2528250	I'm probably wrong, though.
2530338	2531879	I thought, you know what might be fun?
2531959	2534621	Why don't you guys, why don't you guys play match game with us?
2534841	2536062	We're going to do a match game segment.
2536082	2537043	Why don't you guys play with us?
2537644	2538224	Okay.
2538244	2539966	You guys can be special celebrity guests.
2541707	2542448	Yana's crazy.
2542488	2544129	She's taking this Toffafay thing.
2544309	2545691	She's got this, what's your little toffee?
2545711	2547932	It's a little, describe what Toffafay is, Jamie.
2547952	2549053	I don't know how to explain it.
2549474	2551515	I'm eating it right now.
2551575	2555539	It's got like a hazelnut and it's got like noughts.
2556357	2559699	It's really, really delicious, so I have to put it on my nipple so you can lick it off.
2560919	2562400	Yana's putting this Top of Pay on her nipple.
2562440	2566442	Hazelnut and caramel and chocolate hazelnut filling.
2566522	2567883	Can I lick that when it's on your nipple?
2568163	2571485	Can I lick that when it's on your nipple?
2572165	2573526	Rob, step off my girl.
2576067	2577328	I licked a Top of Pay nipple.
2577348	2577928	Okay.
2578408	2581810	You know, TV in here is going to be like, you know, kind of like a 30s show now.
2582330	2583431	Oh, now.
2583471	2584811	I've seen it once before.
2586909	2588410	and to our three hour trainwreck.
2588650	2589271	Okay.
2589931	2593294	Um, yeah, so, when to do match, we gotta get Ryan for a match game, though.
2593334	2595996	Now, a three hour trainwreck, that just reminds me of, like, Austin Powers.
2596356	2598898	No!
2599238	2599859	Oh, this is great.
2599919	2601119	Exo Saga, like Pedro.
2601240	2603101	No!
2603141	2608585	We got in the chatroom, DSCS SoCalKicks is ranting because we've got lesbians in the house and the webcam's not on.
2611547	2612708	Well, doesn't it suck to be you?
2615012	2619375	Honey, we still have our clothes on, so you're not missing too much.
2619535	2620416	I'm taking off my shirt.
2620476	2621696	Ooh, baby.
2621716	2624919	Hey, should we just, like, make out just to make him jealous?
2624939	2626920	She's going to be wearing nothing but Toffa Fae.
2627740	2632043	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
2632063	2633384	They're going to make out in studio.
2633624	2634805	No, it's Del Taco.
2634985	2637547	Del Taco's trying to eat its way out of my stomach.
2638567	2639068	It's trying to...
2640490	2642272	No, it's trying to breach, just, you know.
2643573	2644214	Okay, wait a minute.
2644234	2646676	You're asking if a Maxim magazine belongs to me.
2647257	2653203	Hello, I know we don't talk about those facts much on the show, but that's not my preferred reading material, got it?
2654344	2662272	I actually have a friend who has it as well, and he basically, let's just put it this way.
2663337	2668438	He got himself a subscription to XY, and for his birthday his dad got him a subscription to Playboy.
2668979	2672540	Just so happened that one day they both came in the mailbox on the same day.
2675640	2676041	Wacky.
2676721	2677141	Crazy.
2677361	2677961	Wild stuff.
2679221	2681042	I think we're getting a phone call.
2682442	2685723	We're not getting a phone call, but our friend here in the house is getting a phone call.
2687104	2688204	I don't know what's going on.
2689781	2691702	I've lost total and absolute control of this show.
2691722	2693983	Hey, Amanda, did you hear there's a new DDR coming out?
2694003	2695824	DDR Extreme on Christmas Day in Japan?
2696784	2698785	You have this total unenthused look on your face.
2701006	2702707	Well, they'll have it here in about a couple weeks.
2702727	2704148	I'm sure they'll get the game from Japan.
2705488	2706629	It's got Butterfly on it!
2706989	2707509	Apple...
2719890	2720511	This show's gone.
2720531	2722212	You're all nuts right about now.
2722452	2722913	Hi.
2723213	2725815	Some of us do have nuts and some of us don't.
2725855	2730199	Yeah, I know nuts aren't your preferred... Well, you know, like, men are like a box of chocolates.
2730219	2731420	You never know which one has nuts.
2731680	2732080	Oh, my lord.
2732140	2732421	Okay.
2732461	2733141	What is a match?
2743081	2744022	What is the match game?
2744182	2748466	I want to do a match game, but we've got to have our own... Dude, it's got pictures of those guys pulling a truck with their cocks.
2749087	2749687	Sweet.
2750408	2750768	What?
2752650	2752850	What?
2752930	2753170	Ah!
2753190	2758615	That's how they get their things a little bit more... Oh, my God.
2758635	2761838	Okay, long dong.
2762799	2767984	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani, Talk, and Then Some, and this would be the Then Some portion of that.
2768744	2769005	Well...
2770086	2772907	We were talking about what Hooker's two weeks ago.
2773168	2773888	Yeah, wait, hold on.
2773928	2774568	Take the mic, Amanda.
2774628	2777410	I gotta go figure out what's going on with the other guests.
2777450	2777750	Yeah.
2777930	2778390	Okay.
2778410	2779451	Hi.
2780051	2780631	Who's that?
2784733	2795499	This is Jason Schwartzman, better known as the guy that was in Rushmore and also was in that other movie that I didn't like.
2796599	2797920	Two movies I probably haven't seen.
2802403	2804745	Uh-oh, we have family issues, totally.
2807547	2814911	I just got shushed.
2818074	2821096	Let me catch Black Lab up on where we've been.
2821336	2826019	Black Lab, while you were out playing 2DX, we had some from the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
2827737	2829919	Amanda and Yana came into the house, so I'm getting the finger right now.
2830620	2833223	And I bet you'll be getting the finger later.
2836546	2844093	Actually, I think Damien's going to be home today, so... You know, if it wasn't actually for that finger, I'd still be a virgin.
2846236	2850500	Yeah, I just walked into the room and I'm like...
2851266	2853449	You're turning pink.
2853989	2855631	It's so cute, he's fleshy.
2856512	2858475	I'm just trying not to laugh so hard right now.
2859616	2860757	Plus the sugar's kicking in.
2862099	2865343	I don't know how many of us like to remember about the vibrators and everything.
2867492	2869072	I wanted to go to San Francisco to get one.
2869092	2869973	That's just sickening, okay?
2896835	2900317	I don't know if that's the chocolate, if it was that or the chocolate just came out to make a puke, I don't know.
2900337	2903380	Whether it got used or not, it would just be a thing that would be cool to have.
2904600	2906362	Just put it on display, that's all you need it for.
2906382	2907823	I don't know, man.
2907883	2908543	It's all.
2909404	2911525	These, like, religious dildos look pretty funny.
2912366	2918970	You get the little Buddha, Buddha with, like, testicles for some reason, and then the, you know, crucifix dildo.
2919911	2920191	Oh, yeah.
2920511	2922072	Any, any way.
2922092	2923693	We are...
2926607	2927788	Do you feel the power?
2927808	2931051	I think we're going to take a quick break to regroup.
2931071	2931791	It's going to be really quick.
2931811	2933373	We're just going to do like a one song break.
2933433	2934514	What do you want to play?
2935555	2936255	It's on the CD.
2936515	2936816	Okay.
2936916	2941680	He's whipping out a CD, ladies and gentlemen.
2941700	2943441	Dead air.
2944462	2945103	Dead air, dead air.
2945863	2946384	Okay.
2946824	2951508	This song that we're going to be playing is from CKY.
2952208	2953730	It's the Chinese Freestyle Rack.
2953930	2954030	Oh!
2959336	2961277	So, it's pretty sweet.
2961617	2963858	You guys will love it.
2964999	2965479	Where is it?
2965499	2966180	It's right there.
2966660	2966880	Right.
2967060	2967381	Oh, okay.
2967821	2968321	Alright, here we go.
2968341	2970722	We're going to do the CKY Chinese Freestyle Rap.
2970983	2974405	And in the meantime, we need some contestants for Match Game, because we're going to do that right when we get back.
2974445	2975805	But first, we need a trivia question.
2975825	2978187	You want to offer up a trivia question for the chatters, Jamie?
2978667	2979388	On how we're going to get people?
2981569	2981649	Um...
2982449	2985557	We've got to make it kind of simple, but not too hard.
2985597	2987061	Something simple, but not too hard?
2987101	2988043	Something not too easy.
2988063	2988624	Okay, what was...
2991849	2996573	Alright, V from Beatmania 2DX, what was the original song and who composed it?
2997113	3002017	Ah, okay, so V from 2DX, who was the original composer and the name of the original song?
3002097	3002237	Yes.
3002357	3004739	Yes, okay, so just message that to me in the chat room.
3004759	3006381	And you get bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.
3006781	3008562	Yes, bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.
3008602	3014727	So first two people to get in on that, we'll be playing match game with all of us, all six of us in house right now.
3014787	3015988	So we'll be right back.
3020939	3023740	Who wants to taste my general style?
3024580	3027401	You want to taste my general style?
3027461	3028981	I'm going to give it to you now.
3029601	3030902	Who likes my chopsticks?
3030942	3033002	Hit you in the shit with my little lipstick.
3033062	3035483	Yellow, if you want to see me eat yellow.
3035583	3037383	I never seen nothing like you before.
3037523	3040104	I can kick you higher than you can kick me.
3040484	3042305	I can kick you way up into my tree.
3042625	3043985	Who wants a taste of my oolong?

3173361	3173661	Hold on.
3173681	3175483	I have to bring us back with a promo, though.
3175503	3176965	Well, okay, we'll play one more song, then we'll come back.
3177185	3178507	How about this as a promo?
3178788	3180450	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or die.
3181131	3181892	Okay, welcome back.
3181972	3184195	We've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3184215	3185777	All right, we're going to kick your ass.
3186497	3188360	And we have our two contestants for...
3189461	3190041	Thank you for watching!
3213496	3216737	There's going to be four questions for Match Game, unless I can think of more.
3218457	3219438	Hello to DDR Angel.
3219478	3219958	She woke up.
3220038	3220718	She's saying hello.
3221078	3221258	I know.
3222119	3223599	I was counting you as a regular, dear.
3224199	3225059	Because you're a regular.
3225199	3226580	Yeah, you're a regular, dear.
3226620	3229561	And DDR Angel's planning on being in the house in a couple weeks, by the way.
3229581	3230901	Better to be regular than irregular.
3231021	3233122	DDR Angel and Stresa are going to be here in a couple weeks.
3233802	3234182	That's good.
3234842	3235622	I think you, right?
3235763	3236123	Maybe not.
3236183	3236803	Maybe, maybe not.
3238209	3239410	I discussed this with her.
3239610	3244253	It's a two-hour drive each way, so that'd be a total of eight hours driving on my part.
3244853	3245654	We'll work something out.
3245674	3246494	We'll figure something out.
3247055	3247755	We'll figure something out.
3248315	3249236	We'll work it out somehow.
3251317	3254679	But one eight-hour drive we're going to be making, you and me, Loki, this weekend.
3255019	3255760	We're going to SoCal.
3255780	3257101	We're going to SoCal!
3257301	3265366	And we're going to hopefully meet some of our regulars down there and get some interviews, because SoCal Kicks is foaming at the mouth wanting to get on the show, so we've got to go interview him at some point.
3266760	3269644	Jamie, unfortunately, I have a cry because she has to work.
3269664	3270646	She's not going to be able to make it.
3271306	3272728	I'm going to be marathoning on to me.
3273389	3273970	Well, that's cool.
3275052	3277214	You never know during the middle of whatever we have planned.
3277275	3279117	Somebody's cable might start working again.
3279257	3280138	That's right.
3280759	3282662	That goes back to the five keys of the week.
3282942	3286546	If you enjoy the fuck-off shows that's happened here in the past, guess what?
3286566	3287668	It's about to get twice as big.
3290111	3295617	The fucks are going to get twice as big from Jamie, because you know how angsty she can be.
3295737	3296318	Okay, alright.
3296798	3297139	Here we go.
3297159	3299481	We're going to play some DDR match game.
3299561	3300943	DDR match game.
3304287	3306731	So, we have our contestants.
3306851	3307793	Who's our contestants today?
3307893	3310697	Our contestants today are VidPowa from Vegas.
3311038	3312860	I'm very impressed.
3313021	3314122	He got the bonus question, too.
3314142	3315584	He got the bonus question, so he gets a cookie.
3315885	3318349	And nobody else got the answer to the question.
3319142	3320882	Which, by the way, what was the answer?
3321323	3324643	The answer was Vivaldi, Winter from the Four Seasons.
3324943	3325464	Yay!
3326424	3332105	And SoCalKicks, he didn't know that one, but he knew Kakumei, so we let him in anyway, because nobody else decided.
3332145	3334566	But because it was Revolution by Gershwin.
3334586	3335326	Was that Gershwin?
3337146	3337386	Anyway.
3337946	3339807	I took Music Theory, and I was in the band.
3339867	3340027	I was...
3342009	3345970	So, here we go, we're going to play some match games, some Orange Lounge Radio match game.
3346370	3350352	Now, the way this works is, I'm trying to find the music right now, actually.
3351572	3352052	Oh, here it is.
3355153	3360535	We have to explain for our new folks in studio how to play this game, because I don't think they've played match games before.
3360775	3363335	Well, basically, we've got phrases.
3364056	3367437	And on these phrases, we have a blank on these phrases.
3367497	3371238	Basically, it's like, I went to the mall and bought a blank.
3372043	3373705	Dildo, Hello Kitty Vibrator
3379747	3381048	You and I don't go to the same mall.
3381748	3383029	Unless you're in Vegas.
3383229	3385030	They have ones that glow in the dark.
3385050	3386431	Like, you really want to see the inside.
3386591	3394936	Dude, I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to buy hair dye, and they had these things called hand massagers, and they looked like vibrators.
3395837	3398698	It's like those little figure massagers you see in commercials before.
3398738	3399939	No, no, this one was dildo-y.
3399959	3401340	Hand massager with dildo attachment.
3401560	3404482	And they were selling them for $3 at Sally's Beauty Supply.
3405082	3406223	I'm going to make you holla.
3406263	3407904	You know, you know.
3411992	3413413	Okay, yeah, it's time to start.
3413453	3414494	So we got our two contestants.
3414534	3420197	Now, contestants, when you have an answer to fill in the blank with, you're going to message those to me over private message.
3420598	3423139	And the rest of you in the chat room that aren't playing, you can still participate.
3423179	3426161	You can send your suggestions through the chat room, through the main chat room.
3426561	3427742	So go ahead and send those to us.
3428242	3428723	So here we go.
3428743	3430584	We're going to start, and all six of us are celebrities.

3522149	3522649	Hello!
3523630	3525351	Alright, those are our lovely celebrities today.
3525671	3526472	I just had an idea.
3526992	3531395	I think we should have like a little counter or something for every time there's a reference to the porn.
3531695	3535218	You can like talk up the counter and we'll see what the highest number is by the end of the show.
3536359	3538621	Like you can start doing that with the next live show.
3538681	3540122	Like the porn counter.
3540342	3541963	Like that is so South Park!
3542824	3543164	Really? !
3548308	3549489	Can I do the first question now?
3549529	3549909	Here we go.
3550309	3553231	Alright, here's the first question for our folks in the chatroom.
3553872	3567982	The first question is... Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars, but he was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him a blank.
3571849	3582394	Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars that he was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him a blank.
3589618	3593760	I'm just waiting on those answers from the chatroom.
3593920	3596001	Everyone called him a blank.
3600446	3604588	The obvious answers are okay.
3604909	3611372	You guys can put the obvious answers into one.
3623817	3624858	I think they're locked in.
3625239	3626160	They're locked in right now.
3626180	3627801	I'm just going to check and see if they're locked in.
3628822	3629803	Okay, I've got one.
3630203	3632405	Okay, I've got both answers.
3632505	3634267	I do have both answers locked in from the contestant.
3634287	3634868	I just need to make sure.
3635108	3637070	Stars, celebrities, are we ready?
3638651	3639211	You guys are ready?
3639232	3639812	Okay, here we go.
3640653	3640973	Here we go.
3641013	3641714	Going around the room.
3643621	3644021	Let's see.
3644461	3654824	Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars, but everyone was really sad that when he picked Love to Me that everyone called him A. Let's go to the contestants.
3656144	3658105	Vidpower says, Old School Freak.
3658965	3662406	Everyone called him an Old School Freak.
3662426	3664267	That's too G-rated, I don't know, we'll see.
3665267	3668708	SoCalKick says, Everyone called him an Idiot.
3670229	3670530	Idiot.
3670830	3672191	Alright, that's a little harsher.
3672451	3673573	That's more on our page.
3673993	3675214	Let's see if they get any matches.
3675234	3676736	We have Idiot and OldSchoolFree.
3677697	3678398	Let's see, here we go.
3678498	3681119	Jamie, everyone called him a... Dildo!
3681419	3682020	Dildo!
3683420	3685402	Ah, eh, sorry, that is not a match.
3686082	3689744	Loki, everyone called him a... Cocksmoker.
3689924	3691225	Cocksmoker!
3691825	3693286	I'm sorry, that is not a match.
3693826	3696128	Black Lab, I said... Asshat!
3696608	3697248	Asshat!
3698449	3699710	Everyone called him an Asshat.
3699770	3701671	No, I'm sorry, Asshat is not a match.
3702431	3703012	Amanda!
3703312	3706634	I was, like, really drawn for a blank, so all I said was Gorge.
3707094	3709096	Dork is a good answer, but not a match.
3709156	3709717	I'm sorry.
3709797	3710818	I'm sorry, contestants.
3710858	3711299	Not a match.
3711719	3714022	Yana said everyone called him a... Fag.
3714803	3715463	A fag.
3718266	3719267	Everyone called him a fag.
3719307	3719708	Beautiful.
3719788	3724453	And I said that when he picked love to me that everyone called him a fag.
3724573	3725574	I also put fag.
3725854	3727436	We have an in-house match.
3727456	3728577	We have an in-house match.
3730679	3734801	So, um, but unfortunately I didn't match what the contestants put, but that would have been the answer.
3734821	3738543	That would have put you in the lead if you guessed Fag, but unfortunately you did not.
3740163	3742885	So that is a, that is not a match, I apologize.
3742905	3744866	Didn't that come up as an answer on the last show?
3744886	3745946	Yes, it did.
3746006	3746686	I think it did.
3747427	3750888	So putting Fag is usually a pretty good way to get points.
3750928	3752869	Alright, let's do the next question, shall we?
3754930	3755231	Alright.
3756671	3761654	Sammy the Sim File Builder was really excited to be participating in Tournamix 3.
3762594	3766717	But he was shocked to find that the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
3767537	3770479	He instead decided to go and download some blank.
3775441	3776762	Sammy the Sim File Builder
3777606	3784833	was really excited to be participating in Tourney Mix 3, but he was shocked to find that the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
3785474	3788197	He instead decided to go and download some blank.

3816576	3820742	But he was shocked to find out the site went down and he couldn't download any files.
3820802	3823225	He instead decided to go download some blank.

3835732	3836873	Yes, okay, everybody's in.
3837293	3837953	Okay, here we go.
3838293	3842675	The contestant said he instead decided to go and download some.
3842955	3846136	SoCalKick says, hidden camera DDR pad porn.
3847347	3848068	Upskirt Cam.
3848188	3849369	Upskirt Cam, like what?
3849429	3850210	Alright, good answer.
3850590	3854233	Vidpower says, Hardcore XXX Lesbian Emmy Prawn.
3857836	3859618	Ah, so we have porn and prawn.
3861820	3862600	Alright, beautiful.
3865503	3866564	I'm sorry, did you repeat that one?
3866684	3868526	That sounds like a Chinese buffet, I'm sorry.
3870007	3872209	If it was a seafood buffet, I bet you wouldn't have a problem with it.
3872229	3872869	Oh, no, I wouldn't.
3874500	3875241	All right, here we go.
3875541	3877063	Let's check with the stars.
3877624	3880167	Jamie, he decided to go and download some blank.
3880908	3882530	Yaoi Hentai Pokemon fan art.
3882950	3884712	Yaoi Hentai Pokemon fan art.
3884732	3887636	That was almost what I put, but I changed my answer, I have to say.
3888016	3888777	I almost put that.
3889838	3890960	Loki, your answer, please.
3892299	3894000	Well, it's a gimme, come on.
3895281	3898283	Porn, it's like, do you need an excuse?
3898343	3899764	He went to go down with some porn.
3899804	3900924	Alright, is that a match?
3900964	3901925	What do you think, Loki?
3901945	3906128	No, it's not because they're freaking stupid and specific, so I don't get it.
3906188	3907689	Alright, judges say I'm sorry.
3908149	3910390	Half a point each for each of them?
3910871	3911731	Alright, half a point each.
3911751	3912652	Half a point off.
3914515	3917036	One flaccid point each.
3917576	3918396	Alright, half a point.
3918937	3920817	So you get a full point to distribute amongst you guys.
3920837	3922258	So you each have half a point.
3923278	3927219	DSCS says, now he's disputing because he said he said porn.
3927619	3929780	You said hidden camera DDR pad porn.
3930340	3932541	Loki, did you say hidden camera DDR pad porn?
3933321	3933481	No.
3933541	3935722	Hidden camera porn shit?
3935742	3936562	That's not porn.
3936582	3937582	You get half a point.
3937602	3938063	Deal with it.
3938083	3941023	I think as far as Loki's concerned, if it fucks, it works.
3943092	3944893	Alright, Black Lab, your answer, please.
3945594	3948956	I just went with something that I knew they wouldn't say, so I just said Robs.
3950256	3950877	You said what?
3950977	3951637	I said Robs.
3953798	3954419	Oh, Robs!
3954699	3955660	I thought you said Robs.
3955780	3956760	I'm like, what?
3957040	3957901	I have a website?
3958061	3958341	Sky.com?
3965453	3966734	I didn't know I had a website.
3967254	3967975	Oh, I'm sorry.
3968295	3968595	My bad.
3968635	3969896	I'm bringing out the Mr. Spanky voice.
3969916	3970236	My bad.
3970676	3971017	All right.
3971377	3972077	It's all tied up.
3972117	3972778	Half a point each.
3973438	3974419	Amanda, what did you put?
3974499	3976340	I originally put porn.
3976400	3978942	I started saying, no, that's too general.
3978962	3980303	I need to be a little bit more specific.
3980323	3981904	So I said barnyard porn.
3982184	3983365	Barnyard porn!
3984215	3984635	Word.
3984815	3985656	Wonderful answer.
3985716	3986936	Unfortunately, not a match.
3987596	3989237	Yana, what did he go download?
3989277	3991337	He downloaded some... Midget porno.
3991538	3992678	Midget porno.
3992798	3993478	I'm sorry.
3993518	3994799	That is also not a match.
3995539	3996679	Although, I don't know.
3996699	4000121	Because, you know, a lot of Asian people are pretty short.
4000181	4002641	And if you're doing the upskirt camp... I'm just kidding.
4002681	4003582	I'm just kidding.
4003622	4004102	I'm kidding.
4005243	4006624	I'm going to get smacked.
4006964	4007244	Alright.
4007845	4008145	Alright.
4009206	4012849	My answer, as I said, I was trying to match Jamie, but unfortunately I didn't.
4012869	4015371	He decided to go download some Harry Potter Yaoi.
4016792	4018933	Okay.
4020395	4025038	I don't mind Yaoi fandom, but there are some things that I will not stand for.
4025639	4028161	And this is something about ten-year-old boys.
4029382	4032084	No, I knew you weren't really going to put that, but I was hoping our contestants would.
4033243	4036744	Dude, you should have said, download naked pictures of Alan Rickman.
4036844	4037504	I mean, come on.
4038885	4040745	That would have been, like, a definite match.
4040965	4046967	But I thought that, like, most yaoi's, like, they look like they're ten years old as it is, the way they're drawn.
4046987	4050888	There are no naked pictures of Alan Rickman on the ground.
4051529	4054630	I'm getting smacked by the chatroom for the short comment, by the way.
4055510	4057110	All these people that are Asian are hitting me.
4059588	4060989	I'm getting stabbed in the kneecaps.
4061730	4062971	I'll stab him with the ferret.
4062991	4065513	Alright.
4065993	4067534	Alright, I'm just kidding you guys, Jesus.
4068355	4069535	Alright, here we go.
4070336	4077661	Next question, so it's tied up at half a point each, one flaccid point between them, our two contestants, SoCalCakes and VidPower.
4077742	4078742	Here's the next question.
4079002	4080303	I think this is the next to last.
4080724	4083566	No, there is five questions, I apologize, there's five, so this is the third question.
4084835	4089517	Dana the DDRer was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
4090298	4096481	She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a blank.
4102183	4106165	Dana the DDRer was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
4106505	4111728	She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a blank.
4114418	4116279	Okay, I have mine.
4137698	4138919	I don't know, Jamie, what do you think?
4139059	4139739	I think it's funny.
4141280	4141720	Go for it.
4141801	4142481	Okay, go for it.
4142621	4145102	Shit!
4146723	4147884	This is going to get really wrong.
4147964	4148624	Alright, here we go.
4149325	4151426	Do we have both our contestants locked in?
4151666	4152707	Are we already in the house?
4152747	4153807	Oh, Black Lab's still working.
4153827	4155348	Well, let's see if the contestants are locked in.
4155368	4155748	Let's see.
4156449	4159511	Okay, we have... Oh, okay, this is going to be interesting.
4159791	4161111	This is going to be very interesting.
4161832	4164053	How many people are we going to offend in this segment?
4164233	4165994	How many people are we about to offend right now?
4166014	4167055	Okay, everybody locked in?
4169055	4170056	Black Lab's still working.
4170096	4170636	He's slow.
4170676	4171136	That's all right.
4171156	4175058	He's the Brett Summers of the show.
4175078	4176259	She was always the last one to walk in.
4176319	4181041	If you ever watch 70s Magic Game, which, by the way, the reason to have the Game Show Network is for 70s Magic Game.
4181101	4183022	Oh, you're in?
4183402	4183582	No.
4183682	4183962	All right.
4183982	4187824	No, the reason to have the Game Show Network is press your luck.
4187944	4188304	Hello.
4188704	4189004	Word.
4189264	4189504	Word.
4190205	4191225	The new one sucks.
4191285	4191585	All right.
4191765	4192126	Here we go.
4195859	4200046	The question is, Dana the DDR was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
4200066	4206036	She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a, VidPower says, fag.
4208058	4212101	DSCS SoCalKick says, wow, everyone here looks like a fag.
4212942	4214643	They both put the same thing.
4214683	4216004	They both put fag.
4216444	4218246	Let's see if they're going to get any matches on this.
4218766	4224310	Jamie walked through the door and said, wow, everyone here looks like a poo-flinging monkey because they're playing Parapara.
4226492	4227833	A poo-flinging monkey.
4228013	4228954	No, I'm sorry.
4228994	4230235	That is not the answer.
4232466	4243834	Loki, she walked through the door to the tournament, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a... I have to apologize ahead of time for the comment that I'm going to make to fill in the blank.
4244675	4252841	I do not mean to offend anybody, but the way it came out, the first thing that came to my head, okay, and I'm not racist or anything.
4252861	4253381	All right, all right.
4253462	4260327	Wow, everyone here looks like a sweaty... Yes, sweaty Jack, that's what I said.
4262113	4262473	Sorry.
4263855	4264356	Oh my.
4264896	4266358	Not a match, unfortunately.
4266498	4267119	Not a match.
4271724	4273385	I tried to be orange like Orange Lamb.
4274467	4275328	Oh boy.
4275648	4277050	Let's see, now you can smack Loki.
4277410	4278852	You can address those cards and letters.
4280740	4281160	All right.
4281981	4282741	Black Lab.
4283581	4288422	Looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a sweaty pig.
4290023	4295844	I mean, honestly, that's the best I could come up with because I had something else in mind, but I didn't want to say it.
4298145	4299065	A sweaty pig.
4299125	4299425	All right.
4299445	4304686	So a little more G-rated and friendly to all our friends.
4304767	4305367	Amanda.
4305787	4306307	Amanda.
4307628	4310910	Dana the DDR-ter was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.
4310930	4317094	She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, Wow, everyone here looks like a... Once again, I have to apologize for this.
4317194	4321636	I've been out of the scene for a while, but I had to take a break a while ago.
4322237	4324238	A split wannabe.
4324718	4331182	Wow, everyone here... Which, you know, I say give them half a point each for that comment.
4335854	4338135	That was good.
4338635	4339915	Amanda gets a zing.
4340035	4340776	That's one zing.
4340816	4341956	Yes, a zing.
4343497	4350399	And actually, the other thing I was thinking he was going to say, that everyone was a tool, because he says that so much.
4352139	4353500	He got a lot of laughter in the chat room.
4353520	4354300	What can you say?
4355541	4355961	All right.
4357571	4359132	They deserve half a point each for their answers.
4359192	4360332	So we're going to up them to one.
4360412	4361913	Okay, one full point apiece.
4361933	4363334	They've got one full point apiece.
4363414	4363834	Beautiful.
4365835	4366535	Zinget.
4368396	4368837	Yana.
4369377	4371178	Wow, everyone here looks like a...
4373659	4375620	A hairy penis with crabs?
4378862	4379783	That was lovely.
4380703	4382504	I tried.
4382664	4384966	Yana, by the way, not very into the Kamani scene.
4385006	4386627	You've never been to a DDR tournament at all, huh?
4386647	4387487	No, I haven't.
4387587	4388228	We forgive you then.
4388248	4391069	It's like a penis with, like, a fro or something, you know?
4392570	4395592	Alright, my answer.
4395752	4398794	Here's my answer.
4398854	4400455	I have a furball in my mouth.
4402080	4408244	She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a fag.
4408364	4409284	I did put fag.
4412986	4414367	So they get two points each.
4414627	4417909	The two of three out of Rob's answers are very gay.
4418750	4419370	Well, you know.
4420271	4421031	All right, here we go.
4421111	4423573	Two more questions left here on Orange Lounge Match Game.
4424233	4424593	I lied.
4424633	4426134	There's actually two more here.
4426694	4428936	So they each have two points.
4428996	4429396	Not bad.
4430154	4431134	Better than last time.
4431154	4432775	They've matched half a time each.
4433576	4435176	I can't believe we came to that half point.
4435256	4436797	I know we're going to get hate mail on that one.
4437758	4438738	And Amanda got a zing.
4441339	4441679	All right.
4442560	4443340	Your next question.
4444881	4448102	Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal this next weekend.
4449603	4453605	They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
4456542	4458564	Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.
4458884	4462267	They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
4465589	4466510	I have mine already.
4476057	4479020	They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
4492728	4495911	One of our contestants has absolutely no idea how to answer this question.
4500796	4505921	Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal next week and they decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.
4506241	4507723	Doesn't have to be a specific place.
4509443	4509763	All right.
4510203	4512044	We have both our contestants locked in.
4512324	4515326	Are all of our studio celebrities locked in?
4515386	4518087	One of our studio celebrities ran away from this show.
4518127	4519448	That's kind of scary.
4520288	4520468	What?
4520508	4521449	This will be back in a sec.
4521489	4521569	Okay.
4521589	4522349	How about you guys?
4522389	4523089	Are you guys locked in?
4523310	4523530	Ready?
4524110	4525070	Oh, you're debating on an answer.
4525150	4526451	Oh, he's back in.
4526571	4527912	Oh, he's got the Raymar stick.
4527932	4530233	Dude, I want to go back and get a couple of those.
4532944	4534605	Dude, you've got a rebar stick.
4534645	4536586	That's cool.
4536726	4537246	That's pretty.
4538147	4539708	Wait, wait, turn off the light, Yana.
4539888	4540328	Turn off the light.
4540668	4541068	Turn off the light.
4541108	4541448	Here we go.
4541509	4541809	Here we go.
4541829	4544530	Oh, dude, yeah.
4544550	4546211	Dude, I want one too.
4546231	4549473	Yeah, I want one too.
4550773	4551654	That's pretty rad.
4553075	4554055	Amazing seizure.
4554615	4555976	Amazing seizure action.
4556056	4557057	Okay, let's turn the light back on.
4557277	4558377	Are all our celebrities locked in?
4558938	4559438	Yes, here we go.
4561252	4563453	Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.
4563473	4568114	Their first stop definitely had to be... SoCalKicks says, SoCalKicks' place.
4569194	4571355	Yes, surprise, shock of socks.
4571995	4572695	By the way, no.
4573116	4576557	VidPower says, a strip club.
4578277	4580618	Good answer, good answer, knowing the people in the studio.
4581886	4582527	All right, Jamie.
4582827	4584368	Loki and Sky took a trip to Southern California.
4584388	4587770	They decided their first stop had to be... Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
4588011	4589732	Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
4590192	4591193	Beautiful answer.
4591653	4593255	Beautiful, but unfortunately not a match.
4593275	4593835	I'm so pissed.
4593875	4595436	I never got to go there.
4595837	4597438	Loki and I need directions to that place.
4597458	4598318	I'll find them for you.
4598839	4600080	I know where the one in Long Beach is.
4600160	4601000	I have never been there.
4601381	4602862	This is to be like the best food ever.
4602882	4603662	You know what they serve?
4604383	4605524	Chicken and Waffles.
4605544	4606084	Beautiful.
4606625	4607125	Beautiful.
4607245	4608066	I love this show.
4608886	4609147	All right.
4611526	4622734	Okay, um, next, next is, uh, Loki, yes, Loki and Sky decided to go to Southern California, their first stop had to be... Bathroom, fuck, it's an eight hour drive!
4623774	4626376	The bathroom, beautiful, but not a match.
4628537	4631960	Black Lab, okay, their first stop had to be...
4633671	4635092	I kind of favored one side here.
4635132	4639315	It said Soap Cow kicked his house, but for reasons other than interview.
4639995	4640836	Oh, wow.
4641476	4642757	Dang, that is a match.
4643437	4644118	That is a match.
4644478	4645539	Does he have strippers there?
4645739	4646980	If we get him drunk enough, maybe.
4648080	4648581	Woohoo!
4649701	4650462	Wait, no.
4652383	4652603	No.
4653064	4655705	Is he going to invite over female strippers?
4656306	4657706	Not, is he going to strip?
4657767	4657967	No.
4658547	4658747	No.
4659227	4659808	That's what I meant.
4661994	4663255	He says, Loki, we do.
4663635	4663896	Alright.
4664416	4665057	So that's a match.
4665257	4665817	Three to two.
4666598	4667599	Oh, VidPower's upset.
4667639	4669200	But there's still a chance to match, VidPower.
4669240	4669961	Don't be too upset.
4670041	4670381	Don't worry.
4671282	4671863	Amanda.
4671883	4679309	The first stop had to be... IHGP, International House of Gay Porn.
4681071	4682993	Amanda says... Did you hear that, Loki?
4683013	4685915	Amanda says our first stop's gonna be the International House of Gay Porn.
4686275	4686916	IHGP.
4689992	4697256	I don't know if you've ever seen this in West Hollywood, there's a gay superstore, and it says GAY SUPERSTORE in big print, and under that, parking in rear.
4697276	4701398	Where every gay man's dream is.
4702819	4703239	Alright.
4704940	4710343	Yana, Sky and Loki went to SoCal Kicks, their first stop had to be... The Dildo Factory.
4710463	4711804	The Dildo Factory!
4714446	4714626	What?
4720808	4721388	Oh, I'm sorry, what?
4721408	4722169	None of them hear what?
4723710	4725831	We said Wentz to SoCal, you said SoCal Kicks.
4728033	4730655	My bad.
4731996	4733697	Whatever, I'm cracked today.
4735539	4737200	Okay, so yeah, I'm sorry, that's not a match.
4737240	4739341	The Dildo Factory Wall of Brilliant Answer is not a match.
4739522	4739802	I'm sorry.
4741201	4750926	My answer was, I was thinking along very similar lines as somebody else here in the studio, that our first stop definitely had to be, I put a gas station, because yes, we're going to have to pay.
4751226	4752366	This is an eight-hour drive.
4753007	4754007	Unfortunately, not a match.
4754047	4757549	So, SoCal Kicks is ahead by a score of three to two.
4758429	4760790	So, VidPower is going to need this next one.
4761070	4762331	This is it.
4762351	4765252	This is the last question, so you need to match on this, okay?
4766193	4766653	Here we go.
4766693	4767414	Here we go.
4774381	4775181	Here we go, here we go.
4775741	4778722	Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
4779583	4781443	We're talking this Jamie right here in the house.
4781543	4783704	Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
4783784	4784704	Yeah, screw them.
4785924	4790466	She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
4792986	4795387	Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.
4795487	4799268	She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
4817708	4820109	Jimmy, you want to tell that story about The Light FM?
4820209	4826390	Okay, at my work, my boss, and I like the people I work with, but they listen to The Light FM all day.
4827070	4836313	Like, they play Celine Dion all day, and Richard Marx, and, and, um...
4838220	4839161	and Brian Adams.
4839841	4841482	And they don't play the good Brian Adams songs.
4842163	4845725	They played Heaven once, that was cool, but they don't play any of the other good songs.
4845765	4847226	Which he only has one other good song.
4848626	4850988	What about the one from Robin Hood?
4851828	4853829	They play that all day.
4855190	4855510	Alright.
4855851	4857451	That place sucks.
4857512	4860873	I have CDs to retaliate with.
4861014	4863315	And then there's the people outside our office that play loud rap.
4864529	4867870	I love this quote here.
4867930	4880933	I'm reading Happy Noodle Boy and it says, I'm going to fly into your butt and prepare all asses for vicious intrusion.
4881954	4883634	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio.
4883654	4884854	I've got a sound clip of Loki.
4893840	4896681	I handed him my Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
4897082	4904685	I can just see it now, they're replacing, since the, for the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me, it's kind of lost.
4905546	4913010	By the way, speaking of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, we're still taking, I think, auditions for the Zombie Day, I think.
4913150	4915871	I don't know if the shows in the chat room are closed now.
4916311	4919653	But send in your sound clip auditions to me.
4919793	4920273	Alright.
4922529	4922869	Cool!
4923410	4925691	And they can reach you through the show email address if they need to.
4925731	4928672	OrangeLaunchRadio at Yahoo.com Alright, here we go.
4929813	4931994	Jamie was really irritated by her coworkers one day.
4932014	4935356	She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.
4935416	4940299	VidPower dedicates his answer to EOSVB and says, I'm going to say propel.
4940579	4942040	Put some propel in her radio.
4942820	4944181	That would probably blow up the radio.
4944201	4945481	That would tear up my radio.
4946382	4950484	SoCalKick says, going to put some yaoi moaning CDs in her radio.
4952541	4953181	No!
4953862	4957264	No, we're not putting in the gravitation soundtrack.
4957864	4958544	Alright, Jamie.
4959665	4961426	Best way to get some revenge on the co-workers.
4961446	4963847	You're going to put some... Korean booty music.
4963947	4965888	Korean booty music in the radio.
4965948	4966788	Which I have done before.
4966848	4968209	I'm sorry, not a match.
4968249	4968769	Good answer.
4970476	4971417	That's because I've done it.
4971737	4972698	Oh yeah, okay.
4972798	4973539	Very good answer.
4976482	4977603	The only answer, really.
4978784	4979965	All the others are just wannabes.
4981147	4983769	Okay, Loki, she decided to put some blank in her radio.
4984029	4988774	Okay, I was going to say Yurby Coca, but that doesn't make any sense, so Bagpipe Music.
4989214	4990235	Bagpipe Music!
4990956	4991737	I've done that before, too.
4994622	4995903	Brilliant, but not a match.
4996803	4997424	Black Lab.
4997584	5001366	She's going to put some... I said the bad TAC music.
5001706	5002927	The bad TAC music.
5004548	5008030	I... There's... Exactly.
5008170	5011872	I have played TAC, by the way, my Ultimate TAC CD in the office before.
5011892	5014573	So, so far, there's been internal matches.
5015314	5015694	Pretty good.
5015814	5018355	There's going to be the 12-minute version of Stoic.
5023558	5027962	I'd rather listen to Albuquerque than listen to a 12-bit stoic.
5028523	5028923	Alright.
5030645	5033327	Okay, Amanda, what is she going to put in her radio?
5033487	5034868	I misunderstood the question.
5035248	5035849	That's okay.
5037871	5039672	That's okay, Amanda, we forgive you anyway.
5040373	5041454	What does she put in her radio?
5042498	5046121	I'm thinking, I'm thinking more of, this is like more of a way of destruction.
5046581	5047002	Oh, okay.
5047022	5047662	Than anything.
5047762	5049023	Well, Jamie's pretty destructive.
5049083	5053146	So, um, cherry bomb juice and vanilla schnapps and vanilla coke.
5055048	5057470	You, you own, thank you.
5058190	5060892	That's very close to propel, but unfortunately not close enough.
5061333	5062534	It's my second happy crack.
5062614	5068638	I'm, I'm just thinking, you know, put it in the radio, and that way it kind of shortens the circuit and the thing blows up, and you, yeah, you know, spill.
5075171	5081795	Although today we were at the Folsom Outlets and we saw the CD by Hampton the Hamster.
5082015	5083236	Fucking shit, burn it.
5083496	5087538	Not only the Hampton dance song, but various other ones of them singing.
5088618	5092561	It was quite frightening.
5092701	5093701	It was pretty frightening.
5093721	5100045	The songs actually were like, there was this one about them talking and it was this weird country type song and it was just strange.
5100085	5101926	There was like Dolly Parton on there too.
5101946	5102346	It was like...
5104214	5104597	Oh crap.
5104799	5105706	Alright, Yana.
5105726	5105847	Nope.
5110882	5113984	You need to stop quoting that in the middle of nowhere like that.
5114525	5118047	Anyways, the hamster dance speed version.
5118247	5122270	They used to have that on their site where you could actually speed up the music and it played twice as fast.
5122830	5125052	And it was, like, god-awful.
5125072	5126533	You want to set the website on fire?
5127354	5128134	Yeah.
5128675	5129215	Alright, Yana.
5129235	5130016	That's possible.
5130616	5134339	Yana, she wanted to piss off her co-workers by putting some Satan music on.
5134659	5135159	In the radio.
5135279	5136440	Satan-worshipping music.
5136480	5138201	Or just Satan music.
5138221	5139582	Just Satan-worshipping music.
5139602	5140203	Have you ever done that?
5140882	5142403	I have put in pagan music in there.
5142443	5145326	I was listening to one of the older Lorraine A. McAfee CDs.
5146187	5146727	Beautiful.
5148549	5156576	Alright, so, my answer was, she got so pissed off at her co-workers, she decided to put some Politary in her radio.
5158217	5163722	Actually, actually, there has been Politary coming out of my radio before.
5163882	5164502	Yes, yes.
5164683	5168466	Because it was on my Fifth Style soundtrack, and I listened to my Fifth Style soundtrack.
5169247	5176649	So, unfortunately, not a match, which means, by a score of 3-2, SoCalKicks is the winner.
5178290	5179530	The winner is you.
5179590	5180430	He loses less.
5181231	5182471	Congratulations.
5183891	5184792	Yay, you.
5184992	5186532	Vidpower, good effort.
5186552	5187532	Congrats, you.
5187592	5190453	You know what, two points, I believe, is better than anyone did last week.
5190913	5191694	That's true.
5191734	5192874	So, that's something to be proud of.
5194142	5203186	Now, uh, no, 23 Magus, I believe, got a point at the end, and I was a big liar, and I said his prize would be he'd get his name in lights on the website, and that never happened, because I'm lazy.
5203766	5206727	So, um, we'll think of, we'll probably do them both.
5206747	5207608	We'll send him a cookie.
5208548	5210909	Maybe we'll send him a special Orange Lounge present.
5211329	5217211	And since we're going to SoCal next week, and we could very well be bumping into SoCalKicks, we'll give SoCalKicks a nice little Orange Lounge present, too.
5217812	5219212	So, uh... We'll give him an orange.
5219632	5219813	Yes.
5220193	5220713	I'm sorry, BlackLock?
5223160	5224280	I think he wants something else.
5227441	5230262	23rd Magus is very sad that I never put his name in life on the website.
5230282	5230842	We'll do that too.
5230862	5231922	We'll give him a cookie, so shut up.
5232262	5232843	Cookies are better.
5233483	5236083	Bloody fuck monkeys, refuse my request of love.
5236444	5238544	Here's this blood feud ends, grandpappy.
5238824	5240125	Grandpappy, rub my feet.
5240445	5241645	Me feet, grandpappy.
5244250	5247052	On that note, I believe it is a very good time to go to a break.
5247452	5250394	Yes, we have the wit and lore of Happy Noodle Boy.
5250414	5251775	That's one of our longest statements ever.
5252276	5252676	Shit.
5253176	5256378	We'll be right back after some... More train wreck.
5256699	5257399	More train wreck.
5257639	5261842	Speaking of trains, we'll play this one to start off this break.
5262442	5262883	Enjoy.
5262923	5264564	We'll be right back in a little bit.
5337303	5339414	And now DJ let's start rocking it, rocking it, rocking it
5413383	5418929	I forget that that's the bad mp3 and I can't play that one so we're going to go to the next song right away here.
5418949	5421471	We're going to play some stuff from Poppin' Music Mickey.
5422152	5422853	This shit rules.
5422953	5423533	Enjoy.
5425615	5426256	What, what, Loki?
5427017	5430040	And there's also a song off of Nintendo 64 version of Disney's Raid.
5450291	5466902	All the birds sing words and the flowers bloom in the tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki-tiki room Welcome to our tropical hideaway, you lucky people, you If we weren't in the show starting right away, we'd be in the audience too
5475260	5478844	Flowers Grooming The Diggy, Diggy, Diggy, Diggy, Diggy Room

5493633	5496974	It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard.
5496994	5502075	Most little birdies will fly away, but the Tiki Room birds are here every day.

5542662	5544743	Fun and dancing are the first requisition.
5545043	5546985	Music in the key, a piece in harmony.
5547225	5550287	The world all together, and that's the way it has to be.
5550307	5552328	Moving to the beat, there were shoes on the street.
5552368	5554850	When they saw the black-and-white, they took off their suits.
5554910	5556691	In the house, who was it about?
5556731	5559093	We know in the Mickey, and you see what it's about.
5559173	5560734	Hey, hey, Mickey.

5594005	5594606	Thanks for watching!
5620157	5621377	Orange Lounge Radio.
5621718	5623878	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
5624799	5631701	You're so bad.
5633361	5635782	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5635862	5637583	Welcome to our nightmare.
5638083	5640284	Now, you said you had an impersonation you wanted to do for us.
5640744	5641224	Yes, Yana?
5642159	5643840	It's Mickey Mouse having sex.
5644541	5648163	Oh, oh, oh, Minnie, oh, oh, oh, Pluto, what you doing down there?
5648383	5649804	Oh, oh, don't stop now.
5652065	5654347	Oh, oh, keep going Pluto.
5654667	5655667	Act like it's a hot dog.
5655908	5656428	Oh, yeah.
5657288	5658929	Lick that mustard right off, baby.
5660010	5661411	Oh, yeah.
5662512	5663432	Oh, hi Minnie.
5666559	5667480	I'm not cheating on you!
5667980	5669921	Orange Lounge Radio, how low can you go?
5670281	5670922	How low?
5671142	5671822	So low.
5671842	5673243	That was cool.
5673343	5674824	If it wasn't air, why?
5681872	5682553	I'm dismayed.
5682633	5683994	We need to do our Fuck Use of the Week.
5684014	5685495	We're going to do our Fuck Use of the Week?
5685776	5685956	Yeah.
5686016	5693002	Okay, well then let me close up all the windows so I can get folks to send me their F-Use of the Week.
5693482	5698707	You want to send those on over to me over private message or you can send them to our email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
5699147	5704151	But before the Fuck Use of the Week, maybe we ought to, because I need a little time to get the music queued up, maybe now's a good time to do the Sim Update?
5704212	5704672	Sim Update.
5705132	5705693	Sim Update.
5707259	5707599	Okay.
5708220	5709220	Um, let's see.
5709620	5714803	Big news this week, of course, is that Tourney Mix 3, it's, uh, all the files are up to download.
5714903	5717145	Oh, wait, you can't because the server's clogged.
5717185	5717585	Sorry.
5717985	5718285	Uh-huh.
5718886	5724949	So, no, they're all up to download, but you're one of the lucky ones that's able to actually get through and you can download over 100 different DWIs.
5727050	5728471	Uh, did you make the cut?
5728491	5729151	No, I got bumped down.
5729171	5729371	Don't!
5755241	5756045	Eh, doesn't matter.
5756367	5759120	Doesn't matter at all because no one can play any of the files right now, so ha!
5762439	5763920	Bitter, table for one, bitter.
5764960	5772002	And, big news on my site, leechfromloki.com, or .tk is going to become one of the largest sim file sites ever.
5772642	5773183	Ever!
5773363	5773683	Ever!
5774103	5780765	I got, um, DDR Llama from DDR Maniacs has given me unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth to do with whatever I want.
5781165	5789128	So now, you will be able to find leechfromloki.tk at the new address, which is not yet up, but it will be, um,
5790779	5803549	www.willddrforfood.net And I will have everything.
5804290	5808553	Right now in my collection I have 1800 sim files, so all those will be going up.
5808633	5811696	And then of course the Tourney Mix stuff and whatever else I can throw up there.
5811936	5812957	Everything.
5813617	5814757	Everything, yes.
5815257	5816678	Everything that's going to be fixed.
5816698	5819879	I have to fix everything to make sure it's all working correctly.
5820819	5827040	But, yeah, so I have to do a complete redesign of the site, and that might take a while, so, you know.
5827240	5836242	In the meantime, well, there is a few updates on my site, but I haven't really linked those to the main page yet, so you won't see them unless I've told you, so.
5837683	5839463	Oh, well.
5840243	5842284	Other than just the sim file stuff...
5843887	5846529	Not too much going on other than Turning Mix 3.
5846829	5848791	I mean, that's pretty much the big thing.
5849752	5861784	Of course, I already mentioned earlier in the show, but if anyone just joined us, MakeEditGetPorn is getting pushed back to two weeks from now because of our site going down, so...
5863899	5867321	23rd Magus would like to know if we can do a live step file review at some point.
5868441	5869361	That's a good idea.
5869582	5875924	I can't set it up tonight because I don't have the resources because what happens is if I load the emulator on this computer, the show crashes.
5876685	5877585	Or we get a lot of drops.
5877625	5878605	We get a lot, a lot of drops.
5878645	5879306	So I can't do it.
5879646	5885708	But what we can do is one night we'll get my roommate to log into his system and we can do a step file review on his computer.
5885748	5886429	Maybe we'll review.
5886749	5888970	We'll do our own take on some of the Tourney Mix 3 entries.
5889010	5889490	What do you think?
5890183	5892684	Alright, I've already, oh, and here's a funny thing.
5892704	5899788	Some people are getting pissed off that they can't download their own files, so they're putting their files up on DDR Maniacs to download for other people.
5900609	5904211	Well, unfortunately, stupid people out there, that disqualifies you.
5904711	5905151	Ha ha.
5905811	5910414	So, you get to try the nice sim files out there, but they're going to be disqualified for a while.
5911380	5913061	Mr. Spanky needs a partner!
5940239	5942800	How to be bondable with leather straps
5965638	5972062	Yeah, it's for a PC version of DDR that Konami, like, Hawaii put out that popped.
5972222	5974543	They say that it has downloadable characters, though.
5974603	5975204	Nobody plays it.
5975284	5980907	Oh, I thought, they've rearranged the page a little bit, it looks like.
5980927	5981447	I thought they did.
5981487	5982088	No, I guess not.
5982128	5984229	I thought there were only one more set downloadable.
5984249	5986510	Anyway, there's Mr. Spanky right there, Amanda.
5986610	5988852	Oh my.
5989372	5989732	Yeah.
5990973	5991673	It's that bad.
5992534	5994275	Alright, it's even worse in audio.
5995658	5996899	Yes, it's even worse than audio.
5998199	6000100	Mr. Spanky is a regular on our show, though.
6001461	6001861	He does.
6002662	6003402	What do you think of Zack?
6003462	6004743	He gives our love advice.
6005003	6005743	I'm a lesbian.
6006204	6006324	Oh.
6009405	6010486	Well, what do you think of Alex?
6010546	6015609	I like my girlfriend.
6015849	6017450	Alright, whatever.
6017490	6019411	Can't even get you to cyber flirt.
6019471	6019751	Anyway.
6019891	6023173	Hey, I fucking miss my Alice on my DDR characters, okay?
6023914	6025475	I can name my car after her, shit.
6026735	6028376	That someone set on fire, correct?
6029296	6030057	Backseat, yes.
6031217	6034739	Someone set Amanda's... Someone set Alice on fire, isn't that sad?
6035579	6038140	Yes, um, so when are we getting on to the fuck you?
6039381	6042502	Amanda's... Wow, I think Amanda's really eager for this.
6042522	6043303	What do you think, Jamie?
6043763	6044583	Let's go to the fuck you's.
6044643	6046284	Let's go to the fuck you's indeed.
6046344	6046924	Here we go.
6046944	6052447	Okay, my first fuck you of the week actually goes to my belt.
6053468	6057070	Which, um, it's one of those neat ones that you get at, I got it at Torrid.
6058211	6064334	And, uh, it has, uh, these, uh, leather, uh, long leather laces that hang down the side, and one of them broke off.
6064494	6066595	So, there's, you know, the $18 one.
6067776	6071838	Um, my other one goes toward, again, Roseville Gotham, but everyone heard their rant earlier.
6073379	6079162	And, actually, even more so, it goes toward that manager, Chris, and Steve, who runs the place.
6079182	6080443	Let's see what else we have.
6081611	6083792	Eat our collective pussy.
6084092	6084612	Yeah.
6085112	6085913	No, I'm sorry.
6085933	6093255	I actually, if I'm going to have something get near my pussy, it won't be done.
6093275	6093755	Zing!
6094796	6095196	Okay.
6095556	6098737	I only use, I only prefer high quality equipment.
6098817	6099317	Thank you.
6099837	6101398	Not broken like they are.
6102398	6103238	Okay.
6103338	6103779	Anyway.
6105179	6108060	Next, um, what did I say my other one was?
6108160	6109120	I kind of got left out.
6109180	6109220	Um,
6112626	6113707	I don't remember.
6113847	6116008	Oh, that's kind of shitty.
6116068	6118789	What about your tooth thing?
6118809	6119549	Yeah, my tooth.
6120910	6123991	This is sort of half bad, half good.
6124792	6133276	After eating a delicious dinner of, you know, chicken over rice on Wednesday from this really good teriyaki place, it's near my work.
6134133	6138216	I'm walking over to Target from the store and my mouth starts to hurt.
6138956	6143720	And I feel back to my back left molar and there's a big break in it.
6144180	6144940	Yay, I'm happy.
6145421	6149424	So I'm hurting all day and the broken parts are rubbing up against the skin of my mouth.
6149444	6150945	They're really hurting.
6151005	6154667	So I had an emergency visit with my dentist next day.
6154887	6155628	My dentist is awesome.
6157987	6165190	It turned out that the tooth that was broken was one of my wisdom teeth and not one of my molars, which was a good thing, because the wisdom teeth needed to go anyway.
6165230	6168591	They were slightly impacted and causing stress on my other teeth.
6168611	6171673	So, I went in, had the tooth out.
6172193	6177655	This is what sucks is that I didn't have a way to get there, and I had to walk in the rain to the bus stop.
6177675	6178676	Wait, 30 minutes in the rain.
6178796	6179696	While your mouth was bleeding.
6180296	6180997	No, that was what the...
6182282	6203762	and then I get down there and then it's still raining when I have to come back and walk home in the rain from the other bus stop and the whole time is I have my mouth is bleeding from where the you know I've got my mouth full of gauze I get home and I'm tired and then this is what amazes me is how many people were telling me oh you should take it easy I felt fine it's just a tooth
6205484	6208927	I'm telling you, though, you didn't go under and you only had one done.
6209007	6211930	But when I went under and had all four done, I was out for 24 hours.
6212190	6212931	You did not talk to me.
6212951	6213972	I did not exist to you.
6215053	6215954	But after that, I was fine.
6216214	6216955	So I can see that part.
6216995	6219437	I'm going to have them leave me late for my other brief.
6219537	6221219	All they're going to do is just rub my mouth up.
6221239	6225082	Well, when I had mine removed, I had all four out of one.
6225102	6228786	They put me under both the IV and the gas anesthetic.
6228906	6229686	I'm not having an IV.
6230751	6233975	Well, they knocked me out cold for an hour to get all four of my teeth out.
6234435	6238560	And I was so wasted afterwards from all the painkillers.
6242295	6246419	I was pretty much dead for my entire spring break that year.
6246639	6247880	Well, I was pretty tired.
6247900	6251703	I went to work the next day, and I was really exhausted.
6251723	6253464	They didn't expect much of anything from me.
6254325	6256086	When I got mine out at 15, actually, I was fine.
6256106	6256646	They put me out.
6256666	6258088	They gave me the gas and the IV.
6258108	6259729	Pretty much got home.
6259749	6260810	I had to sit in the car.
6260850	6265934	My dad was waiting for me to get back to work, so I was putting cups on my cheeks because they were cold.
6268175	6276340	Pretty much got home, and I was talking to my friends, I was feeling fine, and the next day I was swelled up about twice the way I should be.
6276360	6282564	So if any of those that you're listening to need your wisdom teeth out, and they tell you don't talk afterwards, don't talk.
6282584	6284605	Because they forgot to tell me, and I did.
6284765	6288047	So this is what sucks about all the work I need done.
6288087	6295372	I need my other three wisdom teeth out, and then I have a broken molar next to my right wisdom tooth, because those need an action from those teeth.
6295432	6295592	And, um...
6298018	6299099	Thanks for watching!
6320235	6321596	Nor can I spit, so.
6324418	6324818	Useless!
6325019	6325819	I'm just kidding.
6325879	6327261	I'm just kidding.
6327281	6327981	We love you.
6328041	6330643	Even if she can't spit or swallow.
6330703	6331104	Or suck.
6331124	6331544	Spit or suck.
6331564	6331804	I'm sorry.
6331824	6332465	You can swallow, though.
6332485	6333666	I can swallow just fine.
6334992	6344200	I just wanted to add, though, on the IV thing, because you said that you won't do the IV.
6345361	6348024	You know, I didn't know they were going to do an IV on me.
6348124	6350546	So really, really late, fuck you, to the people that did my surgery.
6350586	6352127	What they did, they distracted me.
6352167	6353949	They had a nurse on the left talking to me.
6354249	6367159	and I'm like, yeah, da-da-da-da-da, and then like, okay, we're just gonna, you know, put some alcohol on your hand, da-da-da-da-da, and then all of a sudden, I feel this little prick on my right side, I look, they fucking stuck the IV in me, and I feel it crawl up my arm, hit my brain, I'm out.
6367719	6368740	I'm out cold.
6369040	6370561	That was sneaky and mean.
6370661	6373724	I cannot have an IV because I will bruise very badly.
6375240	6379741	When they did my IV, they told me I had like a week at a time that I was going to get it.
6380061	6382621	But, I mean, those things knock you back quick.
6383122	6390263	They put the gas on me, and then it took like about a minute, and my fingers started getting tingly, and they're like, countdown from 100.
6391503	6393103	And I was like, I'm not even going to try.
6393163	6397484	And I was like, out as I finished that set, it was quick.
6397584	6400865	I'm going to ask them actually if I can stay awake for a minute.
6403841	6406882	I would rather be... Well, they're going to numb my mouth anyway, right?
6408242	6411844	Yeah, it's still... Yeah, when you're unconscious, it's a lot easier.
6411864	6412184	You know what?
6412204	6414685	I fell asleep when I was having five fillings done.
6414765	6416026	But Jamie's a trooper.
6416566	6420688	It was not... Well, I know, but he hit a nerve on one of them.
6420828	6422328	Because the nerve went numb.
6422388	6423909	It was one of the major nerves in my mouth.
6423989	6425590	And I said, you know, that's what it is.
6426812	6427713	I got to jump in here.
6428073	6429814	I know you probably got some more fuck yous in here.
6429894	6430294	Oh, that's it?
6430354	6433135	Okay, because I want to get to Amanda and Yana because they got to go soon.
6433195	6436797	So I wanted to go ahead and let them jump in with their FUs of the week because they've never got to do this before.
6436837	6440799	So Amanda, I know this isn't really a fuck you song, but I know it's Amanda's favorite of yours.
6442978	6443518	Not anymore?
6443959	6444499	Not really.
6444599	6445160	Oh, I'm sorry.
6445340	6447561	Well, then it is a fuck you song.
6447581	6449682	Then it is a fuck you song because you don't like it anymore.
6449702	6449963	I'm sorry.
6449983	6450523	No, I still like it.
6450543	6451143	It's not as good.
6451264	6451584	Oh, okay.
6451784	6452744	Okay, I have a few here.
6452764	6455226	Some of these are belated, but that's okay.
6455786	6461910	On Yana's part, fuck you to the doctors who told her her spleen was swallowed up and made her go to the hospital emergency room.
6462271	6469916	She had to get surgery to get it operated on when there was nothing wrong except she had a sinus infection and strep throat and she was dehydrated.
6472677	6474477	No comment, I don't like hot dogs.
6503303	6504023	Oh, the chicken bake?
6504244	6506325	Yeah, those chicken bakes are hella good.
6506645	6511707	Yeah, um, I know I have, I'm sure, several other fuck yous, um, I'm trying to think.
6513628	6520172	Fuck you to, um, oh yeah, fuck you to Sonoma County police officers for pulling me over that day and giving me a speeding ticket.
6520792	6521112	Don't!
6522313	6522893	How fast?
6523354	6523894	How fast?
6524114	6525134	Um, I was actually going 80...
6526491	6533595	But he clocked me for 80 and a 65, he clocked me for 75 because he actually asked me how fast I was going.
6533635	6541480	How fast I thought I was going, I think, well, you know, I noticed as I looked down, I saw it was about 75, you know, about between 70 and 75.
6542101	6546804	And believe it, yeah, well, actually I was going 80, but he clocked me at.
6547504	6549665	Fortunately, though, the police officer was very nice.
6549745	6553268	It wasn't actually him himself, it was more just the law.
6554874	6555495	Fuck the law.
6557156	6558476	Thank you.
6560758	6566461	Bucky to very other people who shall rename nameless, but I don't know if you listen in any way.
6567822	6568682	What did they do to you?
6568902	6571084	Oh, just the general public?
6571764	6573845	Fuck the general public who doesn't listen to Orange Lounge?
6573885	6574526	Well, let's see.
6574546	6574846	Well...
6577276	6578737	Hang on, I shall return, hang on.
6578757	6579718	To be continued.
6579858	6580479	To be continued.
6580499	6585863	Well, actually, no, just fuck you to, um, Yana's roommate, Jamie, because... No, not you, not you, not you.
6586003	6589045	This is, um, Miss P. Oh, Princess.
6589286	6589566	Yes.
6591688	6592568	What did she do now?
6593589	6595691	What hasn't she done?
6596451	6597492	Who hasn't she done?
6597552	6597832	Alright.
6597852	6604318	No, well, like, no, he's just... He's just a terrifying, terrifying person.
6605251	6608555	I've met Princess P a couple times.
6609496	6610957	Interesting, interesting character.
6611097	6611378	Yes.
6613880	6614200	All right.
6615161	6615942	Is that all your fuck yous?
6615962	6617262	Oh, oh, oh, no, there's one more.
6617303	6621105	Jamie kind of waving the little Rayvar wand, reminding me.
6621906	6637297	Fuck you to Carl Hills, who was once part of Cool World, who at one of our recent LiveScapes events ran off with our door money and at a second event actually got in broken, sorry, changed our voicemail around and locked us out of our own voicemail.
6637857	6641318	and later said on there, oh, well, I don't even know where this party is, blah, blah, blah.
6641658	6645699	And basically made it so that no one showed up at the party and he might send our company under.
6646439	6648560	So, fuck you to Cool World and Carl Hills.
6649520	6651200	And Cool World, just because they suck.
6651921	6655281	Carl Hills, he said, he just sucks fat dick.
6655481	6656742	That's all it is.
6657642	6661903	He's got nothing better to do than steal a lot of people's money and have nothing.
6662543	6663343	He just sucks.
6663383	6664264	That's fucking it.
6664304	6664624	He sucks.
6666676	6667817	Boycott Planet New Year.
6667857	6668257	Thank you.
6668277	6671539	I was going to ask Yana if she had any angsty FUs.
6671639	6675421	Yeah, I just want to say, fuck you, Jamie.
6676642	6678142	Not this Jamie, not this Jamie.
6678683	6679063	No.
6680584	6681544	This one.
6681564	6682165	Turkey.
6682225	6683625	We call it Turkey.
6684526	6685186	Turkey.
6686007	6687287	Nothing comes out of his mouth.
6687327	6690009	When he talks, you hear nothing but Turkey, Turkey, Turkey.
6690669	6691790	Turkey, Turkey, yeah.
6693334	6694655	You know, that's about it.
6694895	6707266	I mean, it's like watching Charlie Brown, you know, from his mouth it's just a little thing about Taki, Taki, Taki, sausage, Taki, Taki, Taki, tampon, Taki.
6708026	6712250	Okay, and you know, I just don't understand this fat fuck, okay?
6715180	6717061	He's so fucking annoying.
6717321	6719142	Okay, he's like really hairy.
6719302	6719722	I don't know.
6720102	6723784	He looks like a drag queen that just has too much hair on him.
6724084	6726225	You know, it looks really sad because he has too many hormones.
6726245	6727666	I'm trying to figure out what's scary.
6727706	6729527	When he comes onto a sheet or his towel.
6729627	6730848	I think both.
6731508	6733609	He's scarier than the other.
6733669	6735510	No, what it is is... I think it's the purple towel.
6735770	6738851	No, what it is is his towel doesn't even fit on him.
6739372	6739692	Yes.
6740172	6741112	It's so scary.
6741172	6742293	It's like, dude, don't come out.
6742313	6744254	I was going to say, at least the sheet covers more.
6746545	6750346	Okay, and when he takes a bath, it's just beyond filth, okay?
6750526	6752706	It's just really nasty.
6753246	6755407	You're listening to Orange Lesbian Radio.
6755727	6756627	I don't think none of them do.
6756647	6757127	20 of them do.
6757147	6758768	That would really suck if they did, though.
6758788	6761408	But anyways, yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to Jack Janney and...
6779821	6781242	It's lucky to Pepsi, too!
6782322	6783302	I hate Pepsi!
6784843	6785643	Anything else here?
6786484	6790245	Uh, I covered the Doctor Who Disney Rumble explain thing already for you.
6790465	6791046	Oh, yeah!
6791146	6794507	And never, ever trust, like, the, the, what is it?
6796135	6806302	I'm just there to get some, like, some kind of medicine to get rid of my cold, right?
6806382	6810524	And the guy's just like, take a look at my stomach, he's like, your spleen's blown up.
6810564	6813706	He gets another second opinion, he's like, your spleen's blown up.
6813726	6818829	Oh yeah, and, um, fuck you to the doctors who actually decided to do a pregnancy test on Yana after she...
6821778	6824339	Yes, I am pregnant by my woman's tongue.
6824479	6828881	After she told them that she was a virgin and a lesbian, so yeah, we're doing March.
6828901	6830561	Immaculate conception, you never know.
6830621	6832422	Yana could be carrying the baby Jesus.
6832562	6833223	We have to check.
6833243	6834183	No, Rob, Rob.
6834243	6835543	I am the next virgin Mary.
6835563	6837904	Rob, Rob, we're doing March.
6838665	6839225	Yeah, we're...
6842279	6848902	No, what I'm saying is, it really sucks before people just like, they don't have no money whatsoever, right?
6848982	6857787	They go to these clinics just to get this freaking stupid checkup, and they send them to UC Davis where they have no fucking money, okay?
6858067	6859608	I'm stuck with a $6,000 fucking phone bill.
6859628	6865451	It's not a phone bill, but if people wonder why I don't go to the doctor anymore unless I'm dying...
6866724	6873426	Yo, well they told me my spleen was swelled up, so what am I supposed to do to fit there?
6873466	6878067	We gotta make sure that Jamie's not carrying the baby Jesus FD either, so we gotta give her a pregnancy test.
6878928	6880748	There ain't nothing immaculate about me.
6884949	6885430	Beautiful.
6885910	6886210	Ding.
6888390	6893212	Well, if you have that comment, then I don't know why you wanted to count on Yana.
6893956	6895056	What's that?
6895076	6896357	Oh, being immaculate?
6897597	6898917	I am a virgin, okay?
6899057	6902238	And it was really hard for him to just do a pelvic exam.
6903138	6908119	And I mean, it was scary because it sounded like every typical straight guy out there trying to get sex with a woman.
6908319	6915400	It's going to be easy, it's going to, I'm not going to hurt you, it's just, I'm just going to do this, do that, and you know what?
6915461	6917361	It's going to be quick and simple.
6917641	6918561	God, you know what?
6918621	6919681	I asked her, what's that?
6919941	6921962	Maybe you're rich, but you're far from immaculate.
6922862	6928928	Well, you know... I'm just gonna take this cold, hard little tool here... And I'm gonna sneak it right up inside you!
6928948	6933072	Okay, I'm sorry, but guys make the worst gynecologists.
6933593	6936535	Okay, let me tell you something, let me tell you something.
6936616	6939959	When the guy was actually doing, almost going to do the pelvic exam, right?
6940359	6947122	He was like asking me, he was like, well, I don't know how to be like dirty jokes or anything, you know, just like, you know, make you look really calm.
6947482	6950644	But the girl next to me, she's like, yeah, I got a joke for you.
6950724	6952925	It's like really child pornography stuff.
6953005	6957547	I'm like looking at her like, you dumb fuck, what the hell are you doing here?
6957647	6962069	But then I asked the guy, I was like, you know, I asked him, I said, yeah, I got one joke for you.
6962109	6965330	What does a gynecologist and a pizza delivery guy have in common?
6965850	6967771	They both can smell it, but they can't eat it.
6972844	6973645	That joke went in.
6974845	6976245	Oh, that joke just won the show.
6981446	6982307	I'm speechless.
6982447	6984627	You guys got any little rants left in you?
6985647	6986688	No, not really.
6986708	6988448	It's just, fuck you, County.
6988508	6989648	Fuck you, Jamie.
6989668	6990308	Not you, Jamie.
6990408	6990969	Thank you.
6990989	6992649	You know, you're the kind one.
6992689	6994049	Miss P, take it.
6995009	6996910	Daddy, take it, take it, take it.
7000223	7005204	I mean, obviously this guy's got more internet access into his mouth than ever.
7005324	7008425	Well, he's got a mustache to hide all the stretch marks, okay?
7009265	7017007	If you see any gay guys out there, okay, I am a lesbian.
7017087	7017987	Let you guys know.
7018507	7019788	My imagination just broke.
7019988	7021828	I'm sorry.
7022788	7025269	But no, just to let you guys know, if you ever guys...
7028208	7040352	If you guys ever go to the bases or anywhere, any gay club, and see some guy with like a really bad mustache, okay, he's got more stretch marks than fucking any guy in this town, okay?
7041172	7041772	I'm sorry.
7042312	7044313	But yeah, anyway.
7044333	7046194	Maybe even mustaches for added pleasure.
7047274	7050795	And with that, we do have to take off because I'm really hungry.
7050935	7056097	I like how the only thing distinctly Bomani-related about this segment is the music playing in the background.
7062361	7062761	Thank you.
7063262	7064222	You are so kind.
7064522	7066263	I could just kiss you, but no, I can't.
7069766	7073007	Here, lick my chocolate nipple.
7073028	7077991	Thank you, the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
7078031	7079231	Thank you guys very much for being here.
7079251	7079912	We appreciate it.
7080212	7081513	Yes, this crazy one here.
7081573	7082713	My name is Joanna.
7082733	7083934	We'll be back soon.
7086796	7087937	She'll be back next weekend.
7087957	7088637	Two drink minimum.
7088657	7090838	Don't forget to tip your waitress.
7090938	7091759	She'll have more jokes.
7092350	7096693	It will be like the next Howard Stern, you know, but a little bit more better, okay?
7098114	7101196	Amanda, thank you for being with us, and, uh, wow.
7101256	7104277	Hi.
7104678	7105778	Or, bye, yes.
7105838	7106979	It's time for me to go.
7107199	7109140	You know what?
7109381	7112282	I have to say this to all the people that are listening to this.
7113103	7116985	Okay, don't picture it, just have it inside your head, okay?
7117045	7118166	Monkey fucking football.
7121855	7122435	Thank you, dear.
7122995	7124796	Twitch?
7124816	7133558	There had to be one big monkey.
7135338	7135878	Good night, ladies.
7135898	7136739	Thank you for being here.
7137279	7137819	We love you.
7138579	7139359	I love you.
7140660	7142720	I love you more.
7143060	7143960	I love you more.
7143980	7144981	I love you.
7145001	7145181	Okay.
7145241	7145961	I hope my roommate...
7148343	7149403	I love you, boo!
7149423	7151884	I love you, boo!
7178369	7185014	I don't know how to follow that.
7185074	7185895	I'm not a lesbian, I can't follow that.
7207483	7210164	Let's see, you know my regular FDs of the week.
7210824	7230612	Stupid drivers, stupid people, people that talk to me on the phone, people that talk to me that you don't know in person, stupid people that work behind the counters, Golfland, and Nickel City for not having anything there and making me drive down there to go check it out and there's nothing there.
7231132	7231492	So that.
7232594	7234115	Yeah, they make you pay $2 to get in.
7234195	7236835	I'm thinking, oh, there might be an upstairs and an downstairs.
7237396	7239316	Nope, what you see is what you got.
7240337	7245138	But it was... Anyways, so, yeah, F you to that.
7245158	7251880	F you to the DDR East Coast Invasion for thinking that their servers could actually handle people leeching 100 sim files.
7252120	7253781	Or are you fucking stupid or something?
7253981	7255081	That's never gonna work.
7255421	7256522	Never worked last time.
7256642	7257782	It's not gonna work this time.
7258502	7260163	So, yeah, F you to them.
7261348	7263710	and that's all I've got for right now.
7263730	7269175	I have to go to the stupid movie gallery, the store, the chain that I deal with because they're all frickin' Southern.
7269455	7269935	Stupid.
7271417	7271977	Okay, fine.
7271997	7273718	They're Midwestern and stupid.
7273738	7279603	Alright, and, uh, yeah, I don't have too much more to go.
7279663	7284527	I have to go to the stupid Del Taco for making me feel sick.
7284547	7284928	Yeah.
7285028	7286028	That's it.
7287209	7288651	Alright, moving on to Black Lab.
7288691	7290172	Do you feel like you just swallowed a machete?
7294733	7296013	What's your F.U.V.s?
7296073	7298014	I don't remember what it was.
7298054	7302695	Oh, yeah, because of the irony, I'm sorry.
7303215	7304756	I forgot, so I just picked something random.
7304776	7306036	We'll save that for the chatroom.
7306856	7307937	Sorry, I forgot irony.
7308057	7311358	Hold on, I'll find you music.
7311378	7312918	Working on it, working on it, working on it.
7313038	7314499	Alright, here we go.
7314539	7314879	Okay.
7314979	7316219	Now that it's on, um... Let's see.
7316299	7316339	Um...
7323911	7330395	So, constantly, I have very little to rant about this week, because I've actually had a good week.
7330495	7336899	I got away from school, I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in six months, and we've been spending plenty of time together for the evening.
7336919	7337359	Not that yet.
7337519	7337880	Or, yet.
7337900	7340681	Well, I really don't mean yet.
7340861	7342102	Anyway, it happened.
7342262	7342302	Um...
7354415	7357721	Seconding everything about Golfland, yeah.
7358983	7364213	I hate the rain, especially when I have to drive in it.
7364313	7364593	I just...
7366528	7368349	I think I'm coming off my sugar high now.
7369249	7376793	That sucks.
7376833	7377273	That's it?
7378234	7385437	You usually email me like ten FUs a week and you come to the station, you get to be here, be a part of the show experience, you can only come up with two lousy FUs?
7385937	7387418	I'm pathetic, I'm sorry.
7387458	7388959	You make Captain Jack cry.
7391000	7392240	I'd like to see him cry.
7392260	7394261	Because then I can mock him for it.
7395242	7395562	Alright.
7397088	7397448	That's it?
7397508	7398068	That's really it?
7399729	7402430	If you think it's something, let me know.
7402450	7404951	We'll come back.
7404991	7405551	Alright.
7406632	7406912	Alright.
7407772	7408633	My FU of the week.
7409713	7411394	I'd like to give a big FU to my mother.
7412674	7413655	I was at the house today.
7414055	7420478	I was making a payment because we have an insurance plan under both of our names so that I get a better rate because I have an accident on my record.
7420498	7420878	They don't.
7421338	7422498	And I still say FU.
7422518	7423719	That accident was not my fault.
7424830	7426270	You were speeding, you son of a bitch.
7426430	7427811	I don't care if I have to stop sign.
7432512	7436273	My FU goes to my mom because when I went to make a payment, I get a phone call about two hours later.
7436993	7438894	Did you go through the Christmas presents while you were here?
7439454	7440754	Somebody shipped the Christmas presents.
7441134	7442275	Somebody shipped the Christmas presents.
7442295	7442715	It's all wrong.
7443355	7445575	No, I did not go through the Christmas presents.
7446636	7447436	Are you sure?
7447676	7448196	You're lying to me.
7448236	7449096	Why are you laughing?
7449537	7450897	I'm laughing because you're being a dumbass.
7453547	7454167	Yeah, F you.
7455008	7456108	You ask me that every year.
7456208	7458770	Every damn year you ask me if I shake the Christmas.
7458890	7459450	I don't care.
7459770	7460751	Christmas got old.
7460811	7463832	You know, once I left house, you know, I don't get what I want anymore.
7464132	7464893	I get clothes.
7470316	7470796	Alright.
7471576	7475118	One more thing that I should... I don't know why...
7477654	7483338	But for some strange reason, there's like, I cannot come up with anything that I want for Christmas anymore.
7483518	7487281	It's like, why am I not being my usual greedy self?
7487541	7494826	You know, normally I'd have a list of like 20 things that I would want, which I don't, and well, I don't need.
7495947	7497348	And yet this year I come up with...
7499065	7500007	Like, two things.
7500949	7502411	And they're things that I would need.
7502511	7506057	It's like, my change of mentality is really upsetting me.
7507881	7509764	Alright, I got like a little smaller view.
7510084	7511487	These are complete more or less...
7512339	7518622	Um, I've ever seen, okay, I bought, I went out and bought Showgirls because my girlfriend wants to see that movie.
7518642	7518962	Yes.
7519002	7520282	She could have borrowed it for me.
7520702	7522063	That's alright, it's only eight bucks.
7522203	7523624	I really don't, it doesn't matter.
7523644	7527285	So anyways, so I bought Showgirls, so she just wants to watch it.
7527345	7530486	I don't know why, but whatever, so she, we watched it.
7530766	7532887	And I had this urge to go to a strip club.
7532907	7534968	The thing is, they're so fucking expensive.
7535288	7536729	Why do they have to be so expensive?
7537589	7539811	We'll go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night.
7539871	7541532	Obviously not this Tuesday or next Tuesday.
7541552	7542273	It's the holidays.
7542793	7544034	Go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night.
7544415	7546937	It's unlimited drinks, bottomless, for $14.
7547878	7551300	And if you sit in the front row, you'll have to pay like a dollar or something for the strippers.
7551340	7551641	It's good.
7551721	7552101	It's a good deal.
7552121	7553642	You take $20, you have fun all night.
7554243	7554523	I know.
7554583	7555524	I've done before.
7555704	7556424	Yeah, I knew.
7557505	7560008	Look, even I go to strip club and we all know.
7560508	7562310	It's just so fucking expensive.
7562390	7564252	I'm talking about lap dances, okay?
7564532	7566614	Lap dances are fucking expensive.
7566634	7567515	Two song minimum, that's $40.
7567775	7569697	I'll get you a lap dance for Christmas.
7569737	7570397	That's right.
7570417	7571739	Don't buy a lap dance in Vegas.
7571779	7572880	Because they can't, they can't.
7584073	7588678	They're not allowed to actually sit on the laps anymore.
7588738	7590620	In LA, they have touching.
7591180	7591681	Oh, yeah.
7592682	7593903	Oh, dear God.
7593923	7595325	I know where I'm getting dragged.
7595685	7604854	Oh, no, I'm not dragging you nowhere, because it was at this one place that Eric's Punk Night on the Zach's Vine boards, his cousin goes there, reaches that place quite a bit.
7605275	7606076	He knows where it's at.
7606196	7606776	I don't know, so...
7608704	7610427	No need for strip clubs.
7610548	7614335	Okay, back to me again because I'm slow and I'm coming up with things now.
7615898	7617141	As for the Tuesday night thing...
7618479	7624881	I hated how good shows always say they leave off at a really suspenseful part, like 24 this week.
7624941	7625321	Yeah, fuck 24.
7625761	7628642	It's like, three weeks on 24.
7628782	7630442	It's like, three weeks.
7630802	7631223	Three weeks.
7631543	7632223	Why?
7633583	7634844	Why do they make us wait?
7634864	7638485	Okay, I'm going to see suspense like that for Buffy, but that's because they canceled our cable.
7640005	7640105	What?
7640165	7641505	And I didn't see the last episode of Buffy.
7641725	7642586	Yeah, it's not being recorded.
7644492	7645193	I'm not sure.
7645233	7645933	I don't think it's there.
7646554	7647155	I'm sorry.
7647175	7647635	21st, baby.
7647695	7649437	Uh-oh.
7650117	7655082	Okay, first of all, Buffy is the only good writing that happens to be on TV right now.
7655602	7658965	Unless you count... Where did writing come into Buffy?
7659145	7660146	Shut up and let me finish.
7660887	7665131	Unless you count Angel or Firefly, which are all written by the same guy.
7665591	7665891	Okay?
7667673	7668274	Firefly's not...
7670211	7670711	Well, okay.
7670731	7671152	Either way.
7671452	7674014	It's like sitting and watching a movie every week.
7674414	7676175	Good writing makes a good show.
7676195	7679337	You know, Firefighter looked like a live-action version of Cowboy Bebop.
7679357	7680198	Along with good acting.
7680238	7680498	Oh, no, wait.
7680538	7683480	Not Cowboy Bebop, but Outlaw Star.
7683720	7686622	I only watched, like, Cardi B's episode of Outlaw Star.
7686642	7687103	Well, 24 is better.
7687123	7687843	But Buffy's very good.
7687863	7689244	24 is unique.
7690605	7694708	And it has Keef instead of... Keef is still hot to this day.
7695528	7697930	But I'd still have to go with Buffy.
7697990	7698470	I'm sorry.
7698530	7699291	No, but actually...
7700146	7706053	I find it funny because, uh, I actually, uh, Kiefer Sutherland's, like, better than Buck.
7706233	7708195	Just, I mean, what's her name?
7708215	7709016	Sarah Michelle Gellar.
7709377	7714342	Okay, but, but... Like, here's Buck, or here's Sarah Michelle Gellar, and here's Kiefer Sutherland.
7714383	7715784	But did Kiefer ever do Rocky?
7715844	7716345	Uh-huh, no.
7716365	7717106	But do I care?
7717246	7718547	That did.
7721677	7725060	Moving right along, because this debate won't end if I don't end it now.
7725080	7725060	24!
7725781	7725060	24!
7726121	7730464	24!
7726141	7730464	I am sending subliminal messages.
7730484	7730464	24!
7730504	7733146	24!
7731125	7733146	Don't make me smack your ass.
7733186	7733847	You will watch 24!
7734007	7736069	I'm in steel-toed boots right now.
7737270	7737930	Isn't Buffy on at 8?
7737970	7738050	No.
7743286	7744486	They are on at the same time, my bad.
7744967	7748368	Alright, anyway, watch them tape one, watch the other, Jesus.
7748488	7749869	Alright, here we go.
7751309	7752510	Do I have any FUs left?
7753670	7754330	I don't think I do.
7754390	7755090	You're right, I don't.
7756211	7757852	We're so going to end this show.
7757872	7760973	We have a fight, a fight just broke out.
7764734	7768738	God, this has been the Jerry Springer episode of Orange Dance Radio.
7768758	7769698	We've had lesbians.
7770099	7771520	We've had a fight break out.
7773902	7776724	I've got the sound samples on that TV.
7776764	7779647	All right, all right, all right.
7779867	7781588	Ah, jeez, now Panda's getting thrown.
7784110	7784410	All right.
7786973	7789134	Can I do the chat room entries now?
7789355	7790475	Moving right along.
7795399	7803186	DSCSS SoCalKick says, over limit and being $145 total bill is my FU.
7805328	7807410	And I don't know what he meant.
7807430	7808491	Oh, credit card?
7808732	7808872	Oh.
7809312	7809853	Credit card, right?
7810600	7813642	I have no idea if he means like his bandwidth or credit card or what, I must have missed it.
7814322	7820045	But he also says, Merry fucking Christmas, I have a broken digital camera and a paid off cell phone bill along with hair bleach cost.
7821606	7825328	He must have said, oh, he's pissed at me now because I didn't know what it was.
7826688	7827248	Ah, that's it.
7827528	7829389	If you're going to yell at me, I'm saving you for last.
7830149	7830449	All right.
7831449	7840412	Strayza says he wants to throw out a huge FU to his dad for telling mom that he's only going to put $150 into Christmas, and he found out that Woody's applying that $150.
7840472	7845333	He's putting that cash into circulation to fix the sink that he broke at least six months ago.
7845753	7849574	He should be fixing the sink because it needs to be fixed, not do it as a fucking Christmas gift to mom.
7850574	7850874	Hmm.
7851835	7852235	Interesting.
7854964	7858145	That's like lame Christmas.
7858185	7861706	23rd Magus says, I have a big thaw humbug or a fuck you to the Christmas season.
7862206	7863947	Christmas sucks when you're broke.
7865227	7866988	Bork the whole fucking season.
7867408	7868088	He put bork.
7868568	7870469	If he meant pork, I don't know.
7870749	7872830	A very accomplished fuck you to Matsuri Japan.
7872890	7873610	I beat you, bitch.
7873630	7874810	Wahaha, cough.
7874890	7875450	Okay, out.
7878631	7883613	He wants to also add that the pizza delivery boy and the gynecologist are also hot to your door in three minutes.
7887686	7892228	Angel says, F you to the Max 2 machine at Rona Park, Scandia, because it stopped taking tokens today.
7892308	7893369	Bad DDR machine.
7894069	7899012	Come visit our neck of the woods, you'll have some real angst built up in you, don't worry.
7904394	7911298	DarkTetsuya says, F you to himself for not waiting for Max USA to save before switching games.
7911318	7913839	Shouldn't you save that privately?
7915040	7915240	What?
7918772	7919793	Anyway, next question.
7920113	7921594	Okay, I don't... Good.
7921634	7922614	I must have missed something.
7922654	7922955	Good.
7925156	7926016	Let's go to Brack2000.
7926237	7930159	Says, F you to missing the first half of the show since some people came over to try out DDR.
7930699	7933981	Even though it was a good night for me and I was passing 7-footers, which is a big improvement for me.
7934762	7935082	Word.
7935282	7939665	If anyone wants to know what to get me for Christmas next year, pick up the December 2002 Maxim issue.
7939765	7940025	It's page 78.
7940065	7940925	I think you'll be very...
7944269	7945631	It's at the bottom of the page.
7946372	7948975	Fuck the bottom of the page, it's at the top of the fucking page.
7949095	7950437	May I do VidPower's FUs now?
7950457	7950697	Yeah.
7951077	7955843	Okay, VidPower says, I'm actually a happy bunny this week, I don't really have any FUs.
7955963	7956804	No FUs for you!
7956985	7958286	That's right, I'm the FU Nazi.
7960709	7961110	Fair enough.
7962885	7963405	Did you hear that?
7963465	7964806	VidPower says, no FUs for you.
7965646	7967706	Oh, how special.
7967766	7969307	He's the FU Nazi tonight.
7970107	7971007	I was looking at the email.
7971047	7972048	No, we do not have anybody email.
7972068	7973628	I'm checking the last ones that just came in.
7975789	7982650	Our bestest friend in the whole wide world, Twen, says, F you to getting something that someone else got you for Christmas three days before Christmas.
7982870	7984311	Okay.
7984351	7987012	To getting something that someone else got you.
7987232	7987872	Like a fruitcake?
7990922	7993805	Giving a present to somebody else who's already given one.
7994805	7995406	Like herpes.
7996247	7997708	The givin' keeps on givin'.
7998648	8010318	Alright, uh, 23rmega says, yes, he said Borg, as in fuck, as in screw, as in ass rape with a 2DX controller, as in hot monkey sex or... I've never heard the word Borg used for that before, that's amazing.
8010678	8016703	Actually, the word, the word Borg was used... I've heard Borg used for that before, but only one person I know uses that.
8017104	8017644	That's so 80s, okay.
8017684	8018184	And he's not...
8019904	8021986	It's actually people at Real Ultimate Power.net.
8022366	8025068	Remember, they say that Real Ninja pork sausage.
8025088	8030032	While they're on their guitars and decapitating their mom.
8030052	8039319	Because remember, their power is so great, it kicks your mom right in the face.
8039339	8044282	Remember, 9 out of 10 winners get their heads cut off by Real Ninja.
8045630	8049851	Twins adding an explanation, so we don't keep calling him Kirby Man or whatever we were saying.
8050451	8051151	Explanation.
8051171	8059673	Lives with mom, but dad got him a DVD box set yesterday, the Back to the Future box set, that his grandma on the other side of the family already got him.
8060573	8063934	So, that's why you asked for a receipt.
8063954	8065034	You asked for a receipt.
8065114	8066395	Take it back.
8066895	8067255	Amen.
8067275	8068275	Get something you really want.
8070487	8072729	That is the official Orange Lounge advice of the day.
8072769	8076752	By the way, good thing Derek is slow.
8076772	8078013	Word.
8078033	8078854	You have another one, Loki?
8080515	8080976	Oh, okay, cool.
8081376	8083057	Alright, we're going to end the FU's of the Week.
8083117	8083498	That's it.
8083558	8084278	Nail in the coffin.
8084318	8084919	Segment's done.
8085760	8086560	It is already 8.50.
8087741	8090463	We're damn near close to the end of the show already, and you know what we've got to do?
8090483	8091404	You know what we've still got to do?
8091424	8094046	We've got to do listless, and we've got to do the cage match.
8094066	8095448	We've got to do them both.
8095608	8098310	So we're going to... I would think...
8099471	8100131	Do Cage Match.
8100151	8103634	I was going to say, let's take the opportunity during Cage Match to get our stuff ready for Listless.
8103774	8104875	Yes, we'll do them both at the same time.
8104895	8105315	We're brilliant.
8105375	8106335	So tonight's Listless.
8106396	8107937	Jamie, tell us about tonight's Listless.
8108197	8112660	Best song, Behmany song released in this year, 2002.
8113860	8116322	SoCalKicks says I forgot one of his.
8116542	8117523	I thought I got them all.
8117563	8118744	I closed your window, SoCal.
8118784	8119204	I'm sorry.
8119684	8120345	Send it again.
8120465	8121025	I'll read it.
8121585	8122426	I thought I got it.
8123547	8123947	My bad.
8127498	8130841	All right, so we're going to do the cage match while we prepare our list.
8130861	8134204	We're going to do best Bomani song leased in 2002.
8134284	8135845	So it can't be old school, it has to be new school.
8136265	8139128	We're talking Max 2, 8th and 7th style, I believe.
8139388	8140309	7th style was early this year.
8142331	8143111	Guitar Freaks.
8146114	8149096	So any of those games you can pick for best Bomani song of 2002.
8150831	8153872	Because next week on the show, Jamie, what's going to happen next week on the show?
8154032	8154972	We ain't going to be here.
8155933	8156673	We ain't going to be here.
8157073	8159013	We're still sort of debating, I guess, what we're going to do.
8159053	8159954	We might do a best of.
8160714	8162034	Someone's cable might be working.
8163015	8164635	Namely me.
8165455	8166496	We'll surprise everybody.
8166736	8168236	So there's going to be one of two things happening.
8168256	8170957	There's going to be a best of show or you're going to get the Jamie experience.
8172517	8174898	And we're playing all Eurobeat and TAC.
8177059	8178019	So deal with it.
8180715	8181755	and I will accept guests.
8182276	8182516	Alright.
8183936	8191139	Uh, DSCS SoCalKicks, last FU, Merry fucking Christmas, I have a broken digicam and a paid off cell phone bill along with hair bleach costs.
8191199	8192539	I know I said that already, oh well.
8193120	8194520	I guess I didn't say it the right way or something.
8194580	8196101	Anyway, can't say I haven't said it now.
8199099	8200079	BlackClap's yelling at you.
8200580	8204562	Okay, let's move on to the cage match while we prepare our list.
8204582	8208223	This means we're going to do hardly any breaks tonight, something the chat room always demands.
8208263	8210364	We take less breaks and do more talking.
8212385	8213566	Okay, let's get into it.
8215907	8218468	Okay, so... Yes, last week...
8224224	8230988	Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a winner for two weeks in a row.
8231108	8234730	This song was the victor of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
8234750	8235851	Because I'm fucking cool.
8235891	8237091	Because you are fucking cool.
8237111	8241414	The winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match was, Jamie, tell us about, because it was your submission.
8241434	8243855	This is, by the way, it's not Happy Hardcore, it's just labeled.
8244395	8244996	Okay, yeah.
8245156	8249078	But it is the Echo Show remix of the Knight Rider theme song.
8249841	8255099	I remember being in the third grade and drawing pictures of Kit in the middle of class because I thought the car was cool.
8255139	8256403	I hated it in and out of the office.
8257037	8258638	Oh, dang, okay.
8259538	8262800	I got the real FU from SoCalKicks and it's huge.
8262820	8263900	I don't know how I missed this.
8264280	8264981	How did I miss that?
8265001	8266661	Anyway, okay, wait, we'll go back to the FU for a sec.
8267462	8269803	FU to the lousiest hell goodbye party Kendra had.
8269863	8272264	Much love to you and your leaving to Japan, but that party sucked.
8272804	8276646	FU, Jackie, for still playing games with me and not being sure if things are going to happen or not.
8276866	8279327	FU, CyberPixels, and not having auto-shell access.
8279667	8284089	Fuck you, Pearl, for needing shell access and not being able to get PHP image gallery thumbnail or script to work.
8284449	8286671	Fuck you, Metroid Prime, for its vague artifact clues.
8286751	8295457	Fuck you, Ruben, for the whole camera deal, even though we got it settled, and now I now have a new Digicam, an FU cell phone service for only being 200 minutes and me going 463 minutes.
8296758	8297499	All right, we're done.
8297559	8298339	No more FUs.
8299120	8299400	Oh, yes.
8300341	8300941	So here it is.
8300981	8305825	There's a clip of last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme song, because Jamie says kid is hot.
8306665	8308286	Dude, the car was fucking amazing.
8308427	8311449	I still want to get that car.
8313598	8314223	Alright, here we go.
8314264	8315070	Here's last week's winner.
8334324	8339347	All right, Jamie's hoping to make this one three victories in a row, but it's gonna... And if you love me, you'll vote for it.
8339527	8343330	It's gonna have to win, and chatroom, you guys will have the final vote.
8343370	8348713	Now, we don't play that whole song, because it did win the last couple weeks, so we kind of give it a little bit of a disadvantage.
8349293	8352095	But you guys are familiar with it, because you listen to the show every week, don't you?
8352375	8355597	But you guys can vote for either that, or you can vote for one of the two new songs.
8355657	8358039	I'm gonna go ahead and do my entry first, then we'll get to Loki's entry.
8358960	8364805	My pick for this week is going to be a popular artist, Ayumi Hamasaki.
8364845	8366206	A lot of you seem to dig her.
8366727	8369450	And I've got a trance remix of the song Connected.
8369830	8371491	And this is going to be my entry for this week.
8371972	8374434	And I like this song because the video reminds me of Bjork.
8375055	8377878	If you've ever seen this video, it's pretty cool and it's very Bjork-ish.
8378438	8379279	Actually, I don't have it.
8379319	8379879	Brad does.
8379939	8382182	Our friend Brad here at Regal on the show, he has it.
8382482	8383363	But this is going to be it.
8383984	8386809	So here's our first entry in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
8386829	8388933	This is Ayumi Hamasaki with a trance remix.
8388953	8392880	I'm not sure of the remix name, but it's called Connected.
8392960	8393621	So here, enjoy.
8416570	8417971	Thank you for watching!
8448893	8449457	DarkSakura
8524555	8525160	3D Duplicate
8591636	8592076	Hello!
8592136	8592676	Hey, we're back!
8592716	8593636	Hey, how'd you like that one?
8593656	8604398	That was Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, the latest entry into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, where the winning song voted by you in the chatroom gets put into regular rotation on Orange Lounge Radio for the next week.
8605098	8607519	So, last week's winner was Knight Rider, you can vote for that.
8608019	8612559	This week you have Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, or... Loki, what's the next track?
8612580	8618701	Um, the next track is going to be from the... Wait, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you because we didn't get feedback on Ayumi Hamasaki.
8618881	8620061	Sorry, we have to do the feedback part.
8620441	8621361	Jamie, what'd you think of that one?
8622128	8627972	I like how you make the best ones a little bit repetitive, so I'd have to say an 8.
8628433	8628533	An 8.
8628713	8629693	Black Lab.
8629793	8634617	A little bit of that, I didn't hear it because I went to the bathroom real quick.
8635157	8636098	That was okay.
8636298	8637999	Like Amy said, it was kind of repetitive.
8639440	8640821	I'd go with a 7.
8641001	8640821	7.
8641081	8641442	Loki.
8642242	8646465	I'm giving it a 6 because I like a Yumi Hamazaki, but it's not Amaboku Beyond.
8646525	8647486	Alright.
8647626	8648747	I almost did that one instead.
8649714	8653515	I'm going to go ahead and give it, I'm actually not going to give it a 10, even though it was my own pick.
8653535	8654816	I'm only going to give it about an 8 too.
8654856	8657577	I do like the song, I think it's cool, very Bjorgian.
8657717	8659438	It is a little repetitive, but I still think it's cool.
8660078	8661738	And I hope it dethrones Knight Rider.
8661758	8663679	Just kidding, just kidding.
8665540	8668301	I hope that the chatroom gets their way, whatever they play.
8669565	8683255	Now, Loki, I'm sorry, you can do your... Alright, now, this is going to be kind of a train wreck, because I forget which track is on the CD, but what it is, is it's actually the song from the, well, not really a hit movie, but it's a cool movie, Run Lola Run.
8683276	8686738	This is Believe by Franco Potente.
8686758	8689120	You also might have seen her in Resident Evil.
8689160	8690261	She was the main character.
8690821	8691622	Actor and singer.
8691942	8694644	Now, this is going to be cool, because I like Run Lola Run.
8694684	8695145	Let's hear this.
8695205	8697026	Alright, but now, I have to intro this.
8697086	8697266	This...
8698627	8701110	The sample you're going to hear are actually the whole song.
8701631	8706176	It's got part of another song in the beginning of it, because this is on one of my mix CDs that I actually mixed together.
8706276	8712363	So it doesn't cut off anything in the song, because the song begins with dialogue in German, so it doesn't really matter.
8712463	8714806	Okay, we're going to make sure this is the right one, okay?
8714826	8715667	Here we go, here we go.
8722279	8723320	Okay, so here it is.
8723680	8724581	This is Loki's pick.
8724621	8727403	The name once more time, in case they can vote, they want to vote for it.
8727563	8728003	Believe.
8728303	8728764	Believe.
8729044	8731746	This is Believe here on the Orange Lounge Radio Cape.
8731786	8732066	Believe.
8732086	8732506	Believe.
8743161	8749410	I don't believe in trouble, I don't believe in pain, I don't believe there's nothing left but running here again.
8750071	8756460	I don't believe in promise, I don't believe in chance, I don't believe you can resist the things that make you sad.
8756920	8759644	I don't believe in silence, cause silence makes you slow.
8839824	8842470	I don't believe in silence cause silence hits us both
8924928	8925789	Thanks for watching!
9009691	9012874	All right, that was the end of that one, because that was part of a kind of a Megamix CD.
9013034	9014435	So, there you have it.
9015296	9017218	Your three entries for this week's Cage Match.
9017238	9019580	You have Knight Rider, last week's Victor, two weeks in a row.
9020180	9023203	Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, and that track was Believe.
9023223	9025525	What did you think of Believe, Jamie?
9027867	9034933	I think it would have put me to sleep had I not listened to it.
9034973	9035333	Seven.
9035674	9036314	Seven for Jamie.
9036354	9036815	Black Lab.
9038391	9044435	I kind of like the beginning, but then it kind of starts, I kind of started to lose some places, yeah, for the end.
9044735	9048778	But, I, I'll, I'll just have a key card to it, give it eight and a half.
9049018	9050019	Eight and a half, Loki.
9051800	9058464	I like that song, because I like that movie, the movie is really sweet, and every time I hear that song, it makes me think of the movie, so, give it a ten.
9058744	9067670	Alright, I, I do like that song, it's cool, I agree with Black Lab, it started off better than it ended, it was a little, I thought it was more repetitive than the Yumi track,
9068130	9072312	But it does remind me of Run Lola Run, which kicks a lot of ass, so I'm going to give that one an 8 as well.
9072332	9075253	So, that was Believe.
9075293	9078775	So now you can send your votes to us right now in the chat room.
9079295	9080656	Just private message them to me.
9080676	9085318	You can vote for Knight Rider, Connected, or Believe.
9085338	9087399	And we will count up your votes during this next break.
9087639	9089500	Jamie, what should we play during this next break?
9089520	9092481	If they don't vote for Knight Rider, David Hasselhoff will cry.
9092522	9093062	Hey, hey, hey.
9093442	9094723	No stacking the ballots.
9094743	9095683	No stacking the ballots.
9099569	9106574	Um, let's, uh, let's, um, go for something for... Just, just Black Lab, do we want to honor Black Lab's Weird Al request?
9106834	9107995	Yeah, let's play some Weird Al.
9108295	9109416	Alright, Weird Al it is.
9109616	9110697	We'll do some Weird Al.
9110717	9112719	We're just going to play this one song, we're going to come right back.
9112739	9118943	So you only have like two minutes to vote, so please hurry up and do so, because we have to come back and get in tonight's list list before the show's over.
9119043	9121285	So, uh, join us.
9121365	9122926	We'll be right back.
9123526	9124027	Eventually.
9125248	9126188	Unless we take a nap.
9154286	9155348	What you wanna do?
9155608	9169126	Wanna be hackers, codecrackers, slackers, wasting time with all the chatboondackers, 9 to 5 chillin' at music packers, workin' at a desk with a dumb little quacker, yeah, bein' the bills with my math program
9169506	9170366	Thank you for watching!
9192792	9205675	It's all about the premiums You gotta be the dumbest dude I've ever seen You've got whiteout all over your screen You think your Commodore 64 is really neato What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?
9205815	9210756	You're using a 286, don't make me laugh Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
9211096	9218178	You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette You're the biggest joke on the internet Your database is a disaster
9218678	9234780	You're waxing your modem, trying to make it go faster Hey fella, I bet you're still living in your parent's cellar Downloading pictures of Sarah Michelle Keller And posting me too, like some braindead AOLA I should do the world a favor and cap you like Oliella You're just about as useful as JPEGs to Helen Keller
9241636	9242997	and the team of the spreadsheets.
9243017	9245059	Got them all printed out on my bed sheets.
9245499	9247001	My new computer's got the clocks.
9247081	9250123	It rocks, but it was obsolete before I opened the box.
9250404	9252626	You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
9252666	9254527	Throw that junk away, man.
9254587	9255388	It's an antique.
9255448	9257290	Your desktop is a month old?
9257310	9260813	Well, that's great if you can use a not as heavy a paperweight.
9260913	9263415	My digital media is life-protective.
9264055	9274427	Every file inspected, no viruses detected I beta tested every operating system Gains popped to some and others I dissed them All your computer fashions, mine's multitasking
9276045	9298153	We even asked if you've got a flat screen monitor 40 inches wide I believe that your says it's a sketch on the side In a 30 qubit world, you're a qubit user You've got your own news group, all total losers Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax When you get your CPU in a box of Cracker Jacks Play me online, well you know that I'll beat you If I ever meet you, I'll control all the leads you What, what, what?
9302007	9307630	Hi, Jamie, do another spur of the moment promo for us, please.
9328374	9331496	If you don't listen to Orange Lounge Radio, you're a fucking loser.
9353051	9353651	Go figure.
9354331	9354932	Go figure.
9354992	9355252	I don't know.
9355292	9355712	That was weird.
9356372	9357612	I apologize to chat room.
9358512	9360093	25 shows and that's never happened to us, though.
9360453	9362393	On Under Station Live, that used to happen every other week.
9362413	9365774	I've been there for that a couple of times.
9366614	9367694	I apologize to you guys.
9368054	9368715	Just reconnect.
9368735	9371115	We should be back now.
9371755	9372876	I'm taking the last votes.
9373956	9375416	I may have missed some of your votes.
9376916	9378657	I may have missed some of your votes for...
9381116	9382636	Did I count that one already?
9382736	9383317	I think I did.
9383357	9384737	I just got one last vote.
9385257	9392759	This is interesting now because since I had a lapse there, I got some last-minute votes for the cage match, and that's caused it to have a tie.
9393820	9394440	Damn you.
9395820	9396820	Bite my ass.
9396840	9397460	So wait a minute.
9397501	9398441	This is very interesting.
9398941	9399901	We have a tie now.
9400461	9403762	Both edged out Knight Rider by one vote each.
9403942	9404322	Die.
9404462	9405803	Connected has three votes.
9405923	9406983	Believe has three votes.
9407043	9408323	We've never had a tie on this show.
9408383	9409104	I get to break the tie.
9410604	9414827	No, the way the tie is going to be broken is now we collectively here get to break the tie.
9414887	9416408	We're going to add votes one at a time.
9416788	9417829	All four of us.
9417929	9418430	All four of us.
9418470	9423373	So we might tie again and then in that case we'll have to get the people who voted for Knight Rider to re-vote.
9423393	9424754	I think we should just do rock, paper, scissors.
9425594	9428376	Yes, in that case if we tie again we're going to do rock, paper, scissors.
9428997	9430878	But let's see, we're going to add votes here in the room.
9430898	9432319	So this is between Connected and Believe.
9432499	9433440	You're going to vote for your own song.
9433460	9434360	You're going to let Jamie pick?
9436522	9437763	Because Black Lab wants a vote too.
9438920	9443424	Okay, we'll assume that Loki and I each vote for the songs we put in, so we cancel each other out.
9444044	9444685	So, Jamie.
9449989	9450830	I vote for Knight Rider.
9453372	9458276	Okay, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, then we do it.
9458456	9462600	Because otherwise, we don't want one person's answer skewing the other.
9463300	9464561	Intentionally fucking it up.
9466303	9467664	How am I going to fuck this up?
9469492	9476042	Alright, I did get the last two votes came in right after that lapse from people who hadn't voted yet.
9476142	9477564	I got the rest of your votes, I'm pretty sure.
9479487	9480769	So, here we go.
9483522	9485343	Okay, you got your written down, Black Lab?
9486303	9488184	Okay, let's see Jamie's.
9488704	9491445	Oh, Black Lab's got one vote there.
9492385	9494346	And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, we have another tie.
9496846	9501308	Nope, nope, nope, this is rock, paper, scissors time, Junkin, between myself and Loki.
9501748	9502148	Here we go.
9503028	9503268	Ready?
9504389	9505309	Here we go, here we go, here we go.
9505469	9505649	Ready?
9506549	9509030	One, two, three.
9509130	9510891	Scissors, cuts, paper, and connected wins.
9512802	9513763	Very close, though.
9513823	9514483	Very close.
9514503	9517005	That means next week I have to pick a song that's going to last another two weeks.
9517085	9518025	Yep, that means, Jamie.
9518065	9519306	But, Jamie, you do have the longest, right?
9519326	9523349	Because, really, because of that holiday show we had in there, too, or those weeks we didn't do it, it was three weeks.
9525450	9525790	All right.
9526311	9530793	So, Connected wins the cage match by a hair, literally.
9531454	9533875	So, there it is.
9535837	9537658	Okay, now we're going to go right into listless.
9539545	9542506	We've got to hurry up and do this segment because we're almost out of time.
9543006	9544247	But we're going to do Listless tonight.
9544347	9545587	So I've got to clear out all these windows.
9545627	9547088	Jamie, tell them about tonight's Listless.
9547828	9554571	This Listless is going to be the best song, Baymani song, that was released in 2002.
9555471	9559553	Which is going to be Guitar Freak's 8th mix, Drum Mania's 7th.
9560808	9564756	Beatmania The Final, 2DX, 7th came out.
9566099	9567061	Yeah, 7th came out this year.
9567381	9568143	7th was early this year.
9568163	9570367	Yeah, it was early this year.
9571244	9579012	Then there's 8th Style and Max 2, yeah Okay, so all those things Also guitar Can you pop the music?
9579972	9594987	Max USA, yeah, Max USA Max USA, Guitar Freaks I already named it I forgot about Max USA, that might actually change my list a little bit Although you probably put the song I'm thinking of Okay, I forgot about Max USA, that's a good one
9597662	9601384	Uh... You also... Guitar Freak 7th Mix would count too.
9602024	9604305	As well as Beatmania 7th Mix, I believe.
9604965	9610167	Which is also being mentioned to me that Beat... Beatmania 3 in the final as well.
9610767	9615609	Which is being mentioned to me also, by the way, to remind everybody that it's coming out on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
9616369	9620251	Beatmania... Well, not DDR Extreme, but Beatmania 7th for the home system.
9620271	9621071	It's coming out.
9621571	9622752	Is it the final or is it 7th?
9623352	9624272	It's coming out for the home system.
9624292	9625393	Yeah, final's gonna be next year.
9626033	9626273	Alright.
9628107	9629928	Best Bae Money Song of 2002
9643550	9644471	I listened to it.
9645011	9647973	I kind of liked athletic songs before.
9649334	9652936	Just like from, like, beat, stage, mix that I'm so used to.
9653356	9661481	But when I heard, when they finally made the move to 7-key in 8-style, the War Game was one of my favorites now.
9661542	9664383	That's my number three.
9664784	9666905	War Game is his number three choice.
9668006	9668306	Loki!
9669466	9674647	Okay, it's one of my favorite songs on Beatmania 2DX, and I made a sim file for it.
9674927	9675828	The Sound of Goodbye.
9676268	9677148	The Sound of Goodbye.
9679288	9679928	That's a good song.
9681329	9682649	Jamie, what's your number three pick?
9682809	9683229	Guideca.
9683689	9684330	Guideca.
9684350	9687290	Did I spell it right?
9687430	9687790	Yes?
9687830	9689531	Yeah, I think it's two C's.
9689591	9690331	I did put two C's, yes.
9690371	9691931	Is it Guideca or Guideca?
9692271	9692731	Guideca.
9693592	9694632	G-I-U, my bad.
9695652	9696572	I couldn't see from over here.
9696752	9697372	Okay, my bad.
9697913	9701033	My number three pick was also The Sound of Goodbye.
9701133	9702674	I also put that as my number three pick.
9703134	9703934	Pick something different?
9705195	9709876	I'm afraid that you're... How about You Leave Me Alone?
9710496	9712036	I don't think it's on anyone's list, so I'm going to put that.
9712076	9712717	You Leave Me Alone.
9714977	9716077	From Max USA.
9718738	9719758	I never have an alternate.
9719778	9721639	Going to my number two choice...
9723707	9726748	It is the Guitar Freaks version of Breakdown.
9726848	9728588	It sounds much better than the DDR version.
9730029	9730289	Yeah.
9730749	9732469	Plus it has a funny little video thing.
9735150	9738431	Now, this is top Bomani game, or Bomani music.
9740031	9740431	Oh, okay.
9741531	9742192	Bomani music.
9742532	9743152	Alright, this year.
9743912	9745973	Alright, um, this changes mine then.
9746533	9748073	Um, Vanity Angel.
9749373	9750134	Which one was that from?
9750474	9750894	Euromix 2.
9750974	9751074	Oh.
9755958	9756758	Very interesting.
9756798	9757738	And the new DDR Extreme.
9758359	9766340	Alright, my number two song, because I am tax bitch, is Gravity.
9766980	9767680	Gravity.
9770581	9771241	Excellent choice.
9772001	9773001	Of course, because I chose it.
9774061	9774502	Thank you.
9774542	9777062	Stray, so you cannot vote for Onyx, please not so quick.
9777082	9778082	That's like four years old.
9778582	9779642	I'm older than that.
9779703	9780843	That's older than God.
9781283	9782183	Okay, um...
9785517	9786278	My number two.
9786438	9793442	No, there was a version of Do It All Night that was on Beatmania 5th Mix.
9794582	9794863	Anyway.
9796444	9796664	Anyway.
9796904	9797224	Rob.
9797624	9798285	Yes, hi, hello.
9799005	9802227	My number two pick is The Beauty of Silence from 2DX7SAL.
9802507	9803247	I love that song.
9803448	9805089	This is a pretty silent list.
9807790	9808791	The Beauty of Silence.
9808811	9810732	All of this silence and leaving people alone.
9812013	9812393	Oh, yay.
9813402	9814103	Well, okay.
9814503	9821870	My next one is actually something that sounded good at first, but then the next version of it that was released was better.
9821890	9824172	It's another one from 2DX8Style.
9824613	9826635	It's another version of Murmured Twins.
9828316	9830698	The piano scales in that song own you.
9833441	9834762	Alright, that's your number one pick.
9834802	9835963	Best but money song of the year, eh?
9836364	9837545	Alright, cool.
9837705	9838546	Alright, good song.
9839449	9839789	Loki.
9840410	9842010	Well, it was a really good song.
9842090	9843111	Steps could have been better.
9843391	9844612	It's Dark Black Forest.
9847593	9847913	Word.
9848013	9848974	That would have been on my list.
9849694	9853416	My number one song is not a tax song, nor is it Sakura.
9854296	9854736	Gasp.
9855056	9857418	Gasp.
9857798	9858478	It's Zero One.
9859339	9860179	Zero One?
9860559	9861440	Very interesting.
9861940	9863681	I've had that song on repeat for an hour before.
9863701	9864961	I'm surprised it wasn't Burning Heat.
9865201	9866442	I was expecting you to put Burning Heat.
9866722	9868423	You know, as much as I love Burning Heat...
9869657	9871337	And I actually crossed out Sakura.
9872078	9874198	Just because I can't, I have to pick it on musical merit.
9874238	9874878	That's too cliche.
9875178	9876358	She can't be that cliche.
9876778	9883160	I had to pick it on musical merit, and as much as I love Burning Heat, I've gotten really tired of hearing Burning Heat.
9883700	9891241	I mean, cause like, I went home after I showed Dan that video, the video for Burning Heat from 2DX.
9891721	9893142	He was freaking playing Gradius 2.
9894362	9894702	Word.
9894842	9894942	And...
9895612	9902524	I love Gradius 2, I love Burning Heat, but Zero One is just so much of a better song.
9909580	9910821	V-35 is my number one choice.
9910901	9911642	I love that song.
9931893	9936339	So, here is the list so far, before we eliminate one from the list.
9936840	9949796	Wargame, Sound of Goodbye, Guideca, You Leave Me Alone, The Guitar Freaks Version Breakdown, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Dark Black Forest, Zero One, and B-35.
9950837	9951798	Alright, this is going to be tough.
9951838	9953879	These are all really good songs, I have to say.
9954720	9957342	Chatroom wants to yell at us for a few things.
9957362	9961124	I'm going to tell you what the chatroom is yelling at us for that we did not put on the list.
9961505	9964487	Rainbow Flyer, Dark Tetsuya is having a cry for Rainbow Flyer.
9965227	9966648	Burning Heat, of course.
9967929	9968410	Crash.
9970391	9971552	And the Whistle Song.
9972091	9973871	Oh, fuck no, that song sucks.
9974332	9979193	Alright, those are things we're getting smacked for, so there you go.
9979473	9981413	Smack them back with the stinky trout.
9981453	9983013	Yeah, smack them back with our list.
9983053	9983473	Here we go.
9983994	9984914	Now we gotta eliminate.
9984954	9985354	Here we go.
9985594	9986514	Black Lab, you're first.
9986914	9988855	Okay, this is a tough one here.
9991955	9992415	Let's see.
9993236	9994896	Between two songs on there...
9996320	10008965	The one that I gotta take off, I just, I've heard it on the radio too much, and frankly I'm not too fond of it in 2DX either, it's the sound of goodbye, so I'm axing that.
10009686	10010386	You suck.
10012367	10018509	Um, here we go, already starting to eliminate all of Loki's lists, this seems to happen every week.
10019150	10019230	Um.
10020390	10024457	I wish there was a band against this group.
10024958	10027162	Bye bye Breakdown, you suck ass.
10027182	10027863	But it's a good song!
10032063	10032863	And what planet?
10033744	10034804	I actually like Breakdown.
10034844	10035484	Breakdown.
10035524	10036625	It's just fun and heavy.
10036665	10040006	Yeah, Breakdown's good, but it's not as good as a lot of the songs on this list.
10040026	10042207	I'm gonna get dirty looks for this.
10042867	10045968	And I actually like the song, but I don't think it should be among the best.
10046548	10047329	Dark Black Forest.
10047809	10048129	Sorry.
10049089	10059473	Because, you know, I heard it and I'm like, oh, well this is a cool song, and then I kept hearing it, and then people kept talking about it, and I'm like, pick a new song.
10060173	10061574	So, yeah.
10062541	10066042	Oh wow, Dark Black Forest goes bye-bye, I'm actually really surprised.
10066442	10073984	Now, as tempting as it is to remove Vanity Angel, because that was my impulse choice, I really, I can't do that to Loki, I can't.
10074024	10080845	And there's another one here staring me in the face that I can't let be on this list, because I think it's just overplayed and overrated.
10081286	10082246	I'm getting rid of Wargame.
10086529	10109802	and Rob and I have come out of this unscathed I wouldn't say that completely because two of those choices were on my list and I replaced them with other things so I think Jamie once again Jamie, you have this tendency to come through the listless segments without any of your songs getting eliminated I told you, I have good taste We have to plot against her one night and just take off all of her choices just to spite her As I kick you in the head repeatedly
10110683	10112204	People have worse tastes than you do.
10113585	10114786	That would be everybody in this room.
10114806	10116007	Remember Mexican tap water Loki?
10116027	10116568	That's all I ask.
10117268	10117569	Hey!
10117989	10118449	Okay.
10119470	10120651	I was trying to be funny.
10120951	10121492	It worked.
10122072	10122593	The end.
10122973	10124034	Well, let's just get the vote on.
10124855	10126156	Alright, let's get your vote on.
10126889	10129111	Jamie, would you like to read this list one more time?
10129211	10134695	Actually, I'm going to paste it in the chat room, and then you can read it, and then people can start sending me their votes.
10135256	10143783	Alright, we have Gudeca, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Rumor Twins, Another, Zero One, and V35.
10144103	10145324	Best Bomani song of 2002.
10146765	10150168	Might I point out, not a single one of those songs from Max 2.
10151886	10152547	Not a single one.
10176684	10178785	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
10179105	10185808	Six times in one day, in different places, and I was going to kill myself if I heard it again.
10185828	10187729	I heard the same thing happen to one of my Happy Hardcore pics.
10189550	10192251	The pics from Happy To Be Hardcore.
10193532	10194592	What song is it that I like?
10195813	10196993	Like the flowers need the rain.
10197513	10199214	I need you baby, I need you baby.
10199234	10200075	No, I know which one it was.
10200295	10200535	It was...
10201727	10205210	It wasn't Innovate, it was one of the other ones.
10205330	10205950	I don't remember.
10206611	10207071	Let Me Play.
10207091	10208172	It was Let Me Play.
10208853	10209233	But anyway.
10209613	10210534	Start voting.
10210554	10211114	Start voting.
10211134	10212295	In the meantime, we're going to play something.
10212415	10213416	I have a suggestion.
10213476	10217299	DarkTetsuya, he's pretty sad and pissy that we didn't put Rainbow Flyer on the list.
10217699	10221782	So I thought maybe, since it's on the 2DX8 style soundtrack, there's a long version of Rainbow Flyer.
10221822	10222563	Maybe we can play that.
10222923	10223464	Let's go for it.
10223484	10224224	To satisfy him.
10224284	10228628	Alright, we're going to play the long version of Rainbow Flyer.
10228668	10230249	The long version of Rainbow Flyer is kind of long.
10231042	10235988	So I think, you know what, no, the long version of Rainbow Flyer is a little bit too long, and it has Santa in it.
10238510	10243476	I don't know, I like Santa, but actually, we're almost at the end of the show, so we've got to keep this break short.
10243496	10250484	So we're going to play the short version of Rainbow Flyer, and we'll play the short version of Burning Heat, and we will come right back to finish this up, this show.
10250724	10252166	Enjoy, send me your votes right now, now, now, now.
10339092	10340834	Thanks for watching!
10381016	10381798	Thanks for watching!
10450120	10451083	Thanks for watching!
10487415	10488756	We're back and guess what?
10489456	10491877	We've had so many ties on our list tonight.
10491917	10492898	This is a very hard one.
10493178	10494619	This is like an everything tie.
10494739	10496160	This is like an everything's tie.
10496760	10499621	We want to take everybody's number two pick.
10500062	10503564	So send me your second choice, a second song you would vote for.
10503664	10508066	Here's the list one more time for your viewing pleasure in the chat room.
10508386	10510067	And Jamie, you want to read that one more time?
10510307	10518133	Videka, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Zero One, and Y35.
10518373	10518553	V35.
10518853	10518973	V35.
10519013	10520114	That's okay.
10521495	10524818	So everybody that's already voted, send us your number two pick.
10525258	10530922	So we'll take your number two pick and add a vote for that, and hopefully we'll be able to break the tie and get a winner.
10530942	10531543	In the meantime...
10532303	10535584	We're going to play one more song that was suggested, the best Mamani song of 2002.
10536664	10540226	However, it wasn't released in 2002, but just because we're funny.
10540826	10541646	Yes, we're funny.
10541886	10542166	Huh?
10542806	10543707	We're going to play it anyway.
10543947	10545687	Oh look, Loki's sleeping.
10547628	10549948	Okay, he's just resting his eyes.
10550249	10550829	Okay, here it is.
10551229	10551449	Enjoy.
10554070	10555492	Thank you for watching!
10627569	10631513	I want to feel you as long as I can Head over heels, I'm breaking your feelings again
10672505	10674170	Thank you for watching!
10711234	10715884	I'm thinking of something, you know that makes me sick I'm feeling forever Naked
10757702	10761064	Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
10761224	10764745	It's a good place to listen to the music.
10766306	10767467	You're listening to Orange Lounge.
10771449	10775351	I forget how to set that thing to do a new message.
10775431	10775971	Rayvar.
10776432	10777292	Turn off lights and do that.
10777312	10778032	It's pretty cool.
10778433	10779113	Rayvar.
10780274	10782715	Anyway, here we are back with the list.
10786730	10788391	Loki, you're going to read this list for us.
10788471	10794396	Tell our listening public, what came in third place for the best Bomani song of 2002?
10794436	10798480	Third place was Vanity Angel from Euromix 2.
10802168	10803809	Black Lab wanted to delete that, too.
10804349	10806390	Second best Beimane song of 2002.
10807711	10810232	Gravity from 7th Cell?
10810253	10816796	Yep, 7th Cell, Woot, and this is very surprising to me, but it did win by quite a few votes.
10816956	10818717	It was most people's second pick.
10818757	10821599	I was a little surprised at this, so it got a lot of tie-break votes.
10821719	10822960	The number one Beimane song of 2002.
10824000	10826302	You Leave Me Alone from D.R.U.S.A.
10826382	10827362	Or Max USA.
10827482	10827723	Yes.
10827743	10828443	Not USA.
10828763	10829824	Not D.R.U.S.A.
10830344	10832225	So, You Leave Me Alone, the number one Balani song in 2002.
10832265	10833506	What do you guys think of that?
10834107	10834827	I disagree.
10834947	10835848	I totally disagree.
10836228	10836969	But it's cool.
10836989	10838149	It's all about Kachaka.
10839990	10840571	Zero one.
10842132	10843032	War Game got erased.
10843153	10843653	I'm sorry.
10843753	10844493	Did I do that?
10845754	10846715	Well, guess what, guys?
10847335	10848216	It's the end of the show.
10848296	10849877	We're pretty much... We're wrapping up.
10850501	10851681	We are all out of show.
10851942	10852942	Oh no, we out of show.
10853282	10859024	So, um, I guess now is the point where I ask everybody, what is your final thought of the day?
10859444	10861465	Jamie, what is your final thought of the day?
10862545	10864946	Um, I want one of those Rayvar Light thingies.
10866166	10867207	You want a Rayvar Light?
10867587	10870008	Maybe for Christmas, Jamie, I will find you a Rayvar Light.
10870588	10871168	Um, okay.
10871348	10871648	Okay.
10872728	10872909	Loki.
10872989	10873949	Actually, I know what I want.
10873969	10875850	Black Lab, your final thought of the day.
10875870	10876670	No, no, there's something else I want.
10876690	10877090	What is it?
10877694	10877974	Sorry.
10878014	10881857	I want the leather-bound, um, hardcover copy of Grimms Fairytales.
10881977	10882337	Leather.
10883137	10883758	Leather!
10887720	10889281	Oh, yes, Black Lab, are you done?
10889421	10889761	I'm sorry?
10890161	10890762	Um, yeah.
10890822	10892283	Okay, Black Lab, your final thought of the day.
10894204	10894784	Final thoughts.
10894964	10896765	I'm coming out of my chocolate high now.
10898146	10898466	Yay.
10899007	10904690	Um, now I get to sleep and then wake up at 7am and drive home.
10904830	10905290	Yay.
10905410	10905631	Yay.
10908420	10909441	Okay, that's it.
10912282	10914903	And my final thought is... Oh!
10914923	10916343	This is my favorite show!
10916403	10916583	Wait!
10916603	10916724	No!
10916744	10917824	This is my favorite show!
10917844	10917964	Look!
10918144	10920405	It's my favorite show!
10922286	10924327	He's thinking it's a fortune cookie or something.
10924747	10925827	No, we have a fortune cookie.
10926027	10927128	We already have a fortune cookie.
10927148	10928128	Dedicated to the holidays.
10928148	10928909	Dedicated to the holidays.
10929569	10934491	My final thought of the day is... Lord of the Rings was very big.
10935431	10936552	Very, very big.
10936572	10937132	First of all...
10938118	10939964	Lord of the Rings is the name of the trilogy.
10941108	10943475	The Two Towers was very big.
10943715	10945501	Now the whole trilogy, I would agree, is very big.
10946522	10949184	Yes, that's what I meant, the whole trilogy is very big.
10949204	10951826	Lord of the Rings Part 2, the quest for more money.
10953467	10955088	That's Spaceballs Part 2, remember?
10955288	10956529	Word, word.
10956770	10962234	And I guess the only other final thought I can think of to us... Oh, you do, Jamie?
10962254	10963334	Yeah, I actually have one more.
10963434	10964295	It's a realization.
10964675	10971801	For anybody who's ever a Mel Brooks fan, anyone ever notice that the song at the end of History of the World Part 2...
10973021	10975182	I'm sorry, part one, the Jews in Space song.
10975703	10980045	Is the exact same tune that was used in Robin Hood Men in Tights for the Men in Tights song?
10981246	10981947	I did not know that.
10983247	10983868	It's the same tune?
10984928	10989411	Yeah, but it's the same tune as the Men in Tights song.
10992413	10993033	Fascinating.
10993353	10996695	Yeah, that's my final thought.
10996876	10997456	Riveting.
10997916	10999197	I thought of one more thing to say.
10999637	10999957	Yeah?
11000538	11000838	Zing.
11000858	11001999	Word!
11002039	11002399	Word!
11004517	11004817	Good night.
11028849	11034992	Now, since Eric Cartman can't seem to remember the words to Oh Holy Night, we're going to use a little shock therapy.
11035333	11041176	I'm going to give one of you children this cattle prod, and if Eric forgets any words, just shock him a little, okay?
11041496	11042437	Who wants the prod?
11042737	11043297	Me, me, me, me, me!
11043337	11044918	I want it, I want it, I want it!
11045318	11046019	Here you go, Kyle.
11046039	11046899	Why don't you take it?
11047139	11047539	Sweet!
11048040	11049401	Okay, Eric, whenever you're ready.
11051802	11051922	And...
11053229	11056471	Oh, what was that for?
11056551	11057291	I didn't screw up.
11057951	11060793	No, Kyle, you can't shock him unless he forgets the words.
11061053	11061973	Sorry, Mr. Garrison.
11062313	11066475	Oh, what was that for?
11066675	11068596	I didn't screw up.
11079975	11083636	Those aren't the words, Eric!
11083716	11083876	Ah!
11083896	11083996	Ah!
11107628	11109789	Very nice, Eric!
11134893	11139216	Okay, Eric, now we're going to do the French words.
11139236	11139436	What?
11162795	11166332	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
